00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:24,871
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, January 16th, 2011 Another MMO is set to go free to play this month An upcoming fighting game plans to punish Rage Quitters And will the 3DS be re-delocked after all?

2
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,735
[SPEAKER_07]: We tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

4
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:45,996
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:48,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be joining you for the next few hours along with my co-host.

6
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:50,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Not here tonight, sadly.

7
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,300
[SPEAKER_07]: The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, is absent from the studio tonight.

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,683
[SPEAKER_07]: She may be coming about halfway through the show, but she is out at a pinball collecting type of event.

9
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a private thing, so it's not something you would have read about on the internet.

10
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:04,705
[SPEAKER_07]: But she's having a pretty good time.

11
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:08,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I got a text from her earlier today that she met some famous pinball maker.

12
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:12,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully she makes it back in time during the show and we can ask her all about her experience there.

13
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:14,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there was beer involved.

14
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,170
[SPEAKER_07]: TechMasterLoki

15
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello everybody to Salacious Pop

16
00:01:58,905 --> 00:01:59,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

17
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:00,386
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, SlicesPop?

18
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:01,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm great.

19
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:01,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

20
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pinch-hitting for Jamie, and I get to read stories.

21
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,548
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be very fun.

22
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:05,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

23
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:06,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

24
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,952
[SPEAKER_09]: If anyone hears a thud, it's because Rob threw a shoe at me because I missed my story cue, and I'm letting there be dead air.

25
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:17,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you hear a thud, stuff happened today.

26
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what happened there.

27
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So otherwise, looking forward to it.

28
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:21,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be fun.

29
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, should be fun.

30
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:24,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I don't know how long DarkSakura is going to be out.

31
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:27,417
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't really give a firm time because I think she just kind of didn't know.

32
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:30,138
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sometimes you get invited to those things and you're like, I don't know.

33
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get the sense it might be a little far away.

34
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be in the Bay Area.

35
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:36,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they haven't even left the par-tay yet, she might be gone for a while.

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so she might show up and just be like, you get the hell up out my seat.

37
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:39,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

38
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:41,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me my mic and get out.

39
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:45,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's when I'm going to bail to the living room and she'll take over stories.

40
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

41
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:52,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Go into the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where we have the live chatters every Sunday night while we do tape.

42
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm noticing Actdeft in our chat room says, DarkSakura ain't home.

43
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:56,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Party!

44
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:58,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it is a little weird.

45
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in her house right now.

46
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's very kind, her and Dan, really, because he lives here too, letting us kind of come in and do our show anyway.

47
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:13,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the super secret way of getting in the house when they're not here that I can't say because we don't want the robbers to show up.

48
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:17,899
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, she's very kind in letting us kind of take over the house.

49
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a little weird, I think, to be in someone's house when they're not here.

50
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like a house-sitting type of thing.

51
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:24,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I didn't feed Shermie.

52
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:26,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy doesn't need to be fed.

53
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:27,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy's just asleep.

54
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:28,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy don't give a shit tonight.

55
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:30,305
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyhow.

56
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:31,065
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

57
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:36,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough talk about being in the house when the owners aren't home and kitties and so forth.

58
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:37,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about video games.

59
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll start off tonight with how is your gaming week?

60
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to mix it up a little bit tonight because DarkSakura's not here.

61
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:42,729
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll start with Loki.

62
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:43,449
[SPEAKER_07]: How is your gaming week?

63
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it was alright.

64
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play a ton of things.

65
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,343
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the new mod games going for Grand Theft Auto, so we've been playing that this week.

66
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird though, like, we've been running into a bunch of strange glitches and I'm not really sure what it's from.

67
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:13,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it might be some leftover data that's in the save files or something, but we have it set to all of our cop cars are flying around and stuff, but for some reason when we're playing the single player game, some of the cop cars don't fly, so it makes me think that some of the old data is in there.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:33,397
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also we've been having issues with cars disappearing on us so it'll look like we're flying around and we're impervious to fire in free mode for some reason and it's odd because I didn't even touch any of those files that would affect that so it's just a bunch of strange glitches but I'm working on it.

69
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:39,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other than that I played a little bit of...

70
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,308
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I play this week, actually?

71
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:49,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I tried a bit of Angry Birds because I've had it purchased on my iPod for the longest time now.

72
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:53,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And I gotta admit, I don't understand it.

73
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:54,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand what the big draw is.

74
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:55,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright.

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun, but I got bored of it really quick.

76
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:06,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know why everyone's so gung-ho about it and have this big raging hard-on for the game because...

77
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that great.

78
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure I understand America's obsession with Angry Birds either.

79
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:13,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely not.

80
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for an iPhone game.

81
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:15,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an okay game.

82
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:16,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

83
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:21,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not something like, oh my god, it's got to warrant movie rights and shit like that.

84
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:22,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And shirts.

85
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:23,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I went into Hot Topic the other day.

86
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:25,539
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Angry Birds shirts now.

87
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:30,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't get it.

88
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

89
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played a lot of addictive games.

90
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:46,572
[SPEAKER_06]: If anything, I think Plants vs. Zombies serves more movie rights and that kind of stuff versus stupid Angry Birds.

91
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:54,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather have Angry Birds shirts than Farmville bottled water and hot dogs, which is very real at 7-Eleven.

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,904
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's a bit absurd, though, for a casual game like that.

93
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

94
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:01,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other things I played this week.

95
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:08,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I just realized it's my move in Words with Friends, which is a much more addicting iPhone game than Angry Birds.

96
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,316
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

97
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I have yet to play that.

98
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:31,941
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I play this week?

99
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,983
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some other stuff that I played that was kind of cool.

100
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been downloading a bunch of random things.

101
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually downloaded today, it was kind of cool, Earth Defense Force.

102
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:54,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, not the Earth Defense Force that I've come to love, but the old Earth Defense Force game that was on the Super Nintendo, which I think came out over here.

103
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say UN Squadron, I think was the...

104
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:27,527
[SPEAKER_06]: The name of it over here Oh god, I loved UN Squadron The old, yeah, yeah That was a Capcom game years ago I think that's the one It looks similar, I could be wrong But I think it's that game But then there was another one I downloaded Was Raptor Call of Shadows Which is an old shareware game From way back in the day From Apogee So that was pretty sweet So I downloaded that And then, what else did I play

105
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a Mensa member, I'm really smart you guys

106
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a member.

107
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:57,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I take the test.

108
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I can be a certified genius that way.

109
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:01,976
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

110
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:06,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray Iannami in our chatroom says, Area 88 slash UN Squadron.

111
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, UN Squadron does not equal Earth Defense Force.

112
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:09,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yeah.

113
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:11,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks similar.

114
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's something else I play.

115
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I may play a little bit of Swords and Poker.

116
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty fun.

117
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really been doing a whole ton of gaming.

118
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Mainly Grand Theft Auto.

119
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:37,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and actually, I did try... There was a video that was out earlier this week of people playing Grand Theft Auto where the cars didn't really have any friction on them.

120
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So they just kind of...

121
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:46,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my PC game set up like that right now.

122
00:08:47,449 --> 00:09:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something I was going to be trying out even before I saw that video because there's this guy who goes by the name Shadow on the boards that I'm on that he did that and there was another mod that he did that was kind of funky like that.

123
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:05,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually probably going to apply those to the Ballad of Gay Tony stuff.

124
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:10,983
[SPEAKER_06]: We've only been playing Lost in Damned so it'd be fun to add that to it.

125
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:15,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also apparently they're going to be releasing script editing tools soon.

126
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:36,304
[SPEAKER_06]: which just opens up the realm of possibilities for Grand Theft Auto modding to all sorts of crazy lengths because if we have access to edit the scripts we can pretty much do whatever we want in the game which is pretty awesome so I'm very excited to see what comes of that that's about it

127
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:37,644
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

128
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?

129
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,846
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of games did you play this week?

130
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:43,647
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week is pretty embarrassing.

131
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:45,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Not much to talk about.

132
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:46,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of WoW.

133
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:50,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want me to talk about that at length, I'll go on your other podcast.

134
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

135
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I'm just leveling up my main and doing Cataclysm stuff.

136
00:09:56,052 --> 00:10:13,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a 1600 point gift card for XBLA and I finally used it for Christmas so I finally used it and I picked up the Scott Pilgrim game the River City Ransom clone so I tinkered with that a bit and then I also used it to get the Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

137
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:36,490
[SPEAKER_09]: and I also have played some Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition which was a leftover from the Steam sale when I picked it up for like four bucks over Christmas and then Poker Night at the Inventory and I'm now 60 grand in the hole again in my global stat so I need to win two rounds so that's frustrating.

138
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you unlocked everything in your Poker Night game yet?

139
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:43,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I still have lots of tabletops and card decks to unlock about four left of each.

140
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:52,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Bobby, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, he talked at length tonight about Back to the Future, the new Telltale game that came out.

141
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:54,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any interest in the Back to the Future games?

142
00:10:55,138 --> 00:11:00,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played any of the Sam and Max, and I loved the original one when it was on the SCUMM engine.

143
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of the Telltale episodic ones, I haven't really messed with those at all.

144
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:15,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also the episodic game that I'm really looking forward to isn't Telltale, sadly, but it's the Penny Arcade one, Precipice of Darkness.

145
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:24,327
[SPEAKER_09]: On their website, they wrote the third volume as an actual, like they wrote it out like a fan fiction.

146
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess the third one was just scrapped because they wrote it out instead like a book.

147
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, they had the first game and the second game and then I guess it was kind of a back and forth thing because I remember reading some things about it where there was like a joke on Twitter about if so many people will buy this game when it's discounted they'll make the third game and the Penny Arcade guys basically came out and said actually that's not true, there's not going to be a third game.

148
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:49,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely missed when that was made official.

149
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:52,578
[SPEAKER_09]: All this time for the last three years I was like when are we getting volume three?

150
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:53,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's happening.

151
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:54,198
[SPEAKER_09]: They just wrote it.

152
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:54,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

153
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:55,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, alright.

154
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:20,112
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah so that's all uh plans versus zombies in book or night it's kind of like when a show on tv gets canceled and you can like maybe maybe the uh producer will write something on the internet or you can watch the rest of the episodes on cbs.com or whatever when you desperately hope that the uh they were able to to squeeze out two or three episodes to wrap it up after they get canceled it's like no that the seventh episode is it there's no closure at all

155
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:22,934
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that freaking show I actually watched?

156
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Harper's Island or something.

157
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:25,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on TV.

158
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a murder mystery.

159
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody dies every week.

160
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it got canceled by CBS like halfway through.

161
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:34,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had to finish watching it on CBS.com.

162
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was actually not that good of a show.

163
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why I watched it every week.

164
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:41,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had kind of a crappy, guessable ending.

165
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably the same reason we watched The Tester or

166
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:45,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably, probably.

167
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:46,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know what?

168
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:52,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the tester, the second season of the tester was probably a little better than Harper's Island and less predictable, sadly.

169
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:54,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

170
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:57,596
[SPEAKER_07]: All sorts of embarrassing TV shows.

171
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:02,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of embarrassing fandom, I will say the Telltale game I'm actually looking forward to is Jurassic Park.

172
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:04,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm really curious to see what they do with it.

173
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:10,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a weird license in some ways for them to have, but I'm kind of excited to see kind of what they do with it.

174
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys remember the Jurassic Park games from...

175
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,182
[SPEAKER_07]: What they had on Super Nintendo.

176
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the Super Nintendo Jurassic Park game?

177
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:21,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was kind of cool, but at the same time it was a little bit junky.

178
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:29,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember two games that came out, both platformers, that were night and day between the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.

179
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was Jurassic Park and Aladdin.

180
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,094
[SPEAKER_09]: When people put on Aladdin for the Genesis, it's like, this is amazing.

181
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:37,935
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jurassic Park was the same way.

182
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:39,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Way better on the Genesis.

183
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:40,537
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

184
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:56,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

185
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:21,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we'll stop talking about games from 15 years ago and talk about something a little more current.

186
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:22,668
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week.

187
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:24,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, not a lot of new stuff.

188
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,029
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, again, mostly WoW in my world as well.

189
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Still playing a little bit of Fallout 3 as well as some other miscellaneous things here and there.

190
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:32,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot of new stuff I tried out.

191
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:39,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I did kind of go to the indie store and I tried a few games on the Xbox Live indie game store because, you know, there's some gems out there once in a while.

192
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:39,955
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find some.

193
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:43,398
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to explain it.

195
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:12,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a bad CD-ROM game from when CD-ROM first came out where they did these full motion movies or whatever.

196
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:22,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like these guys who made the game rented a room at Motel 6 and got their friends to dress up in maid outfits and just act out these scenes.

197
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay them in drinks.

198
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:25,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't even pay them in cash.

199
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:55,488
[SPEAKER_07]: they got their three cute girlfriends to dress inmates outfit and pay them in drinks yes yeah and it was like like Skinamax movies have more plot than this thing did and it was and then you go into the game itself and it's like you're trying to launch balloons up at seagulls so they don't they don't poop on you it's a really like terrible shooter from like the 80s Atari 2600 caliber if someone submitted this game to Newgrounds it would get blammed it would not make it to the flash portal it belongs on Newgrounds it was funny like just how bad it was

200
00:15:55,808 --> 00:16:13,742
[SPEAKER_07]: and then they had the whole like pouting thing at the end oh they didn't buy the game because they don't like us or whatever and I'm just thinking wow this was somebody's fantasy project I can't even but there's guys with made fetishes that'll have a field day with this so have fun I guess this is kind of a you know

201
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:16,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Lights Off, Pants Down kind of game for you guys.

202
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:23,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, other indie games that are worth much more of your time for checking out was the Slash Pop.

203
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,048
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to help me remember the name of this game.

204
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,229
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Cthulhu Saves the World?

205
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Cthulhu Saves the World.

206
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:32,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is by the same guys, I guess, that did Breath of Death 7, which I have yet to play.

207
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, they love their old school RPGs.

208
00:16:36,214 --> 00:16:42,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean like Dragon Warrior on the NES style games or like original Phantasy Star games.

209
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:43,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

210
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

211
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:23,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the other thing I gotta say I like, they had this whole system where the most number of random battles you'll ever get into in a dungeon is 25.

212
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:29,466
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to fight more random encounters, you can go to the main menu and select Fight.

213
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of like you will purposefully go into another random encounter fight.

214
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:34,930
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really neat kind of system.

215
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, somebody really kind of thought that one out.

216
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how to make it... You remember, like, there'd be certain dungeons in Final Fantasy games where, like, every two steps it was like, walk, walk.

217
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Bloop, bloop, bloop!

218
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:45,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

219
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:03,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I thought that was, it has some neat ideas.

220
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like that it's trying to take that really old 8-bit idea and make it better.

221
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:18,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It still felt a little bit like a grind fest to me, but the humor in the game makes it, I think, a little more bearable and makes you kind of curious what joke they're going to tell next.

222
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and especially for the price, because you know, indie games are very reasonably priced.

223
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,061
[SPEAKER_07]: 240 Microsoft points, that's what, three bucks?

224
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:25,942
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as you pay for something on Game Room.

225
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say, heck yeah, why not?

226
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:28,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Go do it.

227
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:32,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really impressed by the soundtrack in Cthulhu Saves the World.

228
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:33,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It did have a good soundtrack.

229
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:33,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing soundtrack.

230
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:44,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it was pretty funny when he, one of the first things you do is you rescue sort of a damsel in distress on the beach and you save her and Cthulhu is like, so am I a hero now?

231
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:51,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And the narrator's like, you're the dark lord of the eldritch, like hell no, saving a girl isn't going to cut it.

232
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a little bit more from you.

233
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was kind of funny how it's very sarcastic.

234
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And she has a big crush on him, I think.

235
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she falls in love with him with his big tentacle mouth.

236
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,602
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, oh, you are so fine.

237
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:04,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you just waiting for the Uesu Doji scene to come happen?

238
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's unpleasant.

239
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,686
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to keep playing just to see if that happens.

240
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:15,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I think games on the marketplace can't be too adult.

241
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Although somehow this...

242
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:20,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Borderline Innuendo Maid Game gets on the marketplace.

243
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:22,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, there's no titty.

244
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,434
[SPEAKER_07]: The game would have been ten times better if there were boobs.

245
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:31,016
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one with titty in it, but it got... Was that the guy game?

246
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:32,517
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

247
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:39,301
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one that was on the indie games or whatever, and it was some chick or whatever, like this guy's girlfriend who...

248
00:19:40,441 --> 00:20:05,980
[SPEAKER_06]: she wasn't like you know supermodel you know it's just some normal chick that you know they had her in lingerie and shit and that game got yanked really quick though unfortunately I'm waiting for now that we've had maids with balloons I'm just waiting for like furries with guns like I can't wait for there to be like the furry porn game on Xbox Live I'm kind of surprised it hasn't hit yet laughing

249
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there could be furries with guns versus maids with balloons.

250
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:12,162
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be crazy.

251
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:13,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

252
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,823
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I just got a text message from Miss DarkSakura.

253
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:18,044
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to be here in two hours.

254
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if she's going to make it.

255
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,905
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just barely going to hit the end of the show if she gets here.

256
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:24,685
[SPEAKER_09]: She can do her cage match.

257
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:25,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

258
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:25,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

259
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:27,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not even the podcast part.

260
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:27,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

261
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And FUs.

262
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,567
[SPEAKER_07]: She'll be here for the afterbirth part of the show.

263
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to think if there was anything else.

264
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:34,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say there was one other game I had tried.

265
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:37,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the cute little arcade game, The Rascals.

266
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that what it was called?

267
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:39,472
[SPEAKER_07]: The Skulls?

268
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, with the skulls that was kind of like Mr. Driller.

269
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,376
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Mr. Driller meets the, you know what it was?

270
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,638
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mario Brothers game on Game Boy Color.

271
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:48,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever play that?

272
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:55,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Super Mario Brothers on Game Boy Color, where you could link the systems and race Mario and Luigi to beat the level as fast as possible?

273
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:56,783
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

274
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:39,242
[SPEAKER_07]: so uh yeah if you're like a fan of the old school 8-bit platformer games especially um you know Mario Brothers type uh it's it's cute um some weird plot devices they use though like I didn't get the whole opening with the ship and the rats I get that they're supposed to be the antagonists but I don't know I I think this game just needed to kind of throw me in and start playing I didn't need all the exposition in the beginning it was a little weird

275
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:53,208
[SPEAKER_07]: but the game's cute and it's definitely worth checking out the demo if you like either old school games or you like platformer games and you can kind of make your decision in there from there because the demo's pretty robust so you can check that out again that is Rascals was the name of the game

276
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:57,110
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it, though, for My Gaming Week.

277
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, not a whole lot else to report on.

278
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just talk housekeeping real quick.

279
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,638
[SPEAKER_07]: We are still here moving towards our 400th show.

280
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:07,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It's set for the first week of February.

281
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,102
[SPEAKER_07]: We're tossing around some ideas internally.

282
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing yet.

283
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:17,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to be too big of a deal because, you know, we've had enough self-serving anniversary episodes amongst our nine-year run.

284
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So we plan to do something a little bit special.

285
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, right now we're talking...

286
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,114
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

287
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,073
[SPEAKER_07]: at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook.

288
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

289
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:43,295
[SPEAKER_07]: How about some news?

290
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:44,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got a lot of it tonight.

291
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:46,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It was surprisingly a busy week.

292
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:51,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess now the holidays have officially faded out and people are back at work and so forth.

293
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:56,125
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting back into some gaming news for what's going to happen through the summer of this year.

294
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:58,347
[SPEAKER_07]: And we start tonight with Loki.

295
00:22:59,412 --> 00:22:59,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

296
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:05,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of people being busy, no one's been busier than Sony and their legal team.

297
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:11,919
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been spending the week suing hackers for hacking the PlayStation 3.

298
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:23,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Two groups, of course, that they were going after, Fail Overflow, which was the hacking group that, during a recent conference, was talking about how they've basically...

299
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:25,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Geohot or George Hotz

300
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:54,277
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the one that actually pioneered the jailbreak for the iPhones and later on went to release the keys for the PlayStation 3 hacking.

301
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:58,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, they're not too pleased by it.

302
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:11,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they're saying, according to the court documents, the hack violates the DMCA, and that already pirated games are being packaged and distributed with these circumvention devices.

303
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:14,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, is not true, but that's what they go to claim.

304
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:15,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

305
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:20,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, George Hotz made a comment about that.

306
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:29,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I would expect the company that prides itself on intellectual property to be well-versed in the provisions of the law, so I'm disappointed in Sony's current action.

307
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:35,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I have spoken with legal counsel, and I'm comfortable that Sony's action against me doesn't have any basis.

308
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course, it's going to continue on from there.

309
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:41,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's how it kind of played out this week.

310
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:55,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Geohot on his website actually put the keys out there so people had access to them as well as various signing tools and samples of possible ways to install and run Homebrew.

311
00:24:56,091 --> 00:25:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: um of course you know none of this actually has anything to do with pirating games it's just installing homebrew and in fact um there are some limitations what he's already released um to not allow pirating games at least yet um

312
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:19,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, it's kind of funny, there's just all sorts of stuff going on.

313
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to go a little bit more in detail here.

314
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:29,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's a few funny things that are kind of going on about this whole court case to begin with.

315
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:34,697
[SPEAKER_06]: One, Sony decided to, I guess...

316
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:45,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Get evidence that Hotz was accepting money, donations, basically saying that, oh, he was charging people for these exploits.

317
00:25:45,658 --> 00:25:48,160
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually sent him a dollar to his PayPal account.

318
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony did, which is kind of weird.

319
00:25:50,761 --> 00:26:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, Hotz's attorneys are saying, Hotz has not produced, manufactured, sold, nor does he have any intent whatsoever to produce, manufacture, sell any devices that facilitate piracy.

320
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:04,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

321
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:20,184
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying that basically it dismisses Sony's use of piracy case for precedent because the case involves hardware used to circumvent PSC's protection, not software.

322
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:21,949
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

323
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,347
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a Sony's in San Francisco, aren't they?

324
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:55,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but they're taking a case up against him.

325
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:56,589
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to do it in his jurisdiction.

326
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:07,614
[SPEAKER_06]: But their thing is basically that he communicated on Twitter and he communicated over using PayPal or something like that.

327
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:10,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And those two companies reside in Northern California.

328
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:15,117
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore... Is this a copyright or trademark issue that they're going for?

329
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,259
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're going for the fact that he released their public keys.

330
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:32,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, because I know anything to do with copyright or trademark or whatever is federal, so then you can intentionally file the claim out of state to make the person drag their ass to the court where you filed it to.

331
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:34,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they basically did that, kind of.

332
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:36,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird.

333
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:55,256
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the comments they're saying is, I think it's quite telling that Sony, who legally is required to provide notice to Mr. Hotz before seeking any special relief with the court, decided to email Mr. Hotz a copy of their motion at 7pm when a hearing was scheduled for the next morning at 9am in California, while Mr. Hotz doesn't even live in California.

334
00:27:55,616 --> 00:28:00,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony is seeking various unreasonable relief, such as seizing Mr. Hotz's personal property and computers.

335
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, the courts postponed the hearing.

336
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,964
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a bunch of comments from different law firms.

337
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:15,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm pretty sure it's just the big company exercising their big company muscle to try and squelch out this guy who has very limited resources, I'm sure.

338
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:22,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if they don't have a case, they're basically saying, hey buddy, you're going to spend money on a plane ticket to drag your ass out here to defend yourself.

339
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:23,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what it is.

340
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:31,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to understand, this is bigger than just a hacker hacking Sony stuff.

341
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,201
[SPEAKER_06]: What this does is sets precedent for a few things.

342
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:42,125
[SPEAKER_06]: There are similar cases that went on when the whole jailbreaking of the iPhone thing happened.

343
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:45,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And that actually was overturned in courts.

344
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:50,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it is legal to jailbreak your phone because of that court case.

345
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this... Interesting comparison.

346
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:54,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I never thought of that.

347
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:57,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I just had to get that out there, but I didn't realize you're right.

348
00:28:58,256 --> 00:29:01,880
[SPEAKER_07]: What this story is is very similar to the whole jailbreaking your iPhone.

349
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's using your device not the way the company intended, but... Not necessarily.

350
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even going beyond that.

351
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:08,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing is...

352
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:23,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, when you buy these consoles in their end user license agreement, it's basically making it seem like you're leasing this property that is Sony's and you're paying a fee to basically lease it and really it's their property but it's in your home.

353
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:33,196
[SPEAKER_06]: This would actually set precedent that this is your console, you can do whatever the fuck you want with it if he ends up winning this case is what it's going to come down to.

354
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:33,896
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

355
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:56,468
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

356
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,727
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

357
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they can do that.

358
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:35,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they can do that, obviously, but I don't think it would be smart for them to do that regardless because a lot of people don't have the know-how to do this.

359
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:41,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, he went on G4 and made a comment about what the whole case was going on.

360
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,006
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't feel that he's...

361
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:44,167
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

362
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:13,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I read some comments from chat?

363
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:17,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Because obviously this is a very passionate issue and some folks in the chat room are kind of lighting up about this.

364
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:24,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick Gertz in our chat room, I don't recognize that name, so welcome if it's your first time, in our chat room says, BS, once you buy something, it's yours.

365
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,057
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want with what you own.

366
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:28,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Read the end-user license agreement.

367
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:34,343
[SPEAKER_06]: You may think that and you may feel that that, and I agree, it should be the case, but that's not what they're saying.

368
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they're able to patch your PlayStation 3 to remove the other operating system and all that stuff.

369
00:31:40,748 --> 00:32:08,227
[SPEAKER_07]: But the courts may ultimately agree with Nick Yes That's going to be very interesting And then SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says Can't blame Sony for protecting its properties And I think they sort of have an obligation to Because of that agreement that they have with developers That there's all these other companies That if this whole thing ends up going against Sony They have an interest in that too Here's the problem though And this may be Sony's This may be Sony's big

370
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:11,652
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

371
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:29,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So should Sony have waited until piracy was a factor?

372
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:30,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the other thing, too.

373
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Geohot has only released... And this is all speculation.

374
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:38,827
[SPEAKER_06]: He's only released a portion of the key.

375
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, he has a...

376
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

377
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:06,309
[SPEAKER_06]: He's smart, you see, because he's hoping this court case goes in his favor.

378
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:10,273
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the case, then it'll be legal for him to release that key, and it's over.

379
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done.

380
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:12,135
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing they can do.

381
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Once that's out there, there is no way to block that anymore.

382
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:17,701
[SPEAKER_06]: They're done.

383
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:19,143
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over.

384
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:21,786
[SPEAKER_07]: SalaciousPop, you want to say something, and then I'll go to more chat comments.

385
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is really just about opening up additional functionality on a console that you own.

386
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:44,537
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was some type of hack where, I don't know, you could pull games down from the PlayStation Network, like their store that was a demo, and unlock it, completely different thing I'm talking about here, where you could then play the full version of the game without paying for it, then yes, that's something that would hurt the developer, but that's...

387
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:46,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Completely different.

388
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:47,700
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what we're dealing with here.

389
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just opening up the console for, you know, Homebrew and whatever else.

390
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:55,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Now granted, everyone doesn't necessarily share that same ideal.

391
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:58,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's people out there that are just like, okay, how can I use this to pirate stuff?

392
00:33:58,647 --> 00:33:59,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, oh yeah.

393
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:02,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's other people though.

394
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,371
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one hacker they're going after.

395
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:05,952
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the whole hacking community.

396
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:06,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one guy.

397
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,054
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not going for piracy.

398
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:14,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So the fact that they're saying, you know, he's releasing tools to enable piracy.

399
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:25,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, in the long run, maybe, but you could say, well, you released a console that enables piracy, because eventually there will be piracy on it.

400
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And just think, if they would have just kept Linux on the damn system, maybe people wouldn't have gone here.

401
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:37,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm convinced that most of the hardcore people in the crypto and DRM communities that love breaking that stuff don't even play games.

402
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,601
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, this is an awesome thing.

403
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:40,962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got awesome DRM on it.

404
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:42,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to break it because that's fun as hell.

405
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:44,144
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fun as hell, yeah.

406
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:44,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

407
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:51,089
[SPEAKER_06]: They're asking him, Daryl, so what's something... Once this whole PS3 thing is done, what's your next thing?

408
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:52,329
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to move on to next?

409
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,693
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your next... Because he stopped doing the iPhone stuff because he got bored with it.

410
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it was.

411
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:01,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy, he's like 21 years old.

412
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:03,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is a 21-year-old.

413
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, he got bored with whatever it was.

414
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like,

415
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:10,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hear the PSP2's coming out.

416
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:13,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go to the other comments from chatroom.

417
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:20,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orange.com Defective Candy in our chatroom says, Can I put end-user license agreements on other things in life, like the door to my house?

418
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:21,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

419
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:23,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

420
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:27,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator PC says, I'd never mess with my system.

421
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:31,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be too afraid of bricking it, thus losing my video content that I bought.

422
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:33,644
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of where I'm at a little bit.

423
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:39,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really don't have a good reason to hack my system.

424
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:40,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Me personally.

425
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:42,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I...

426
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:45,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't really want to pirate everything.

427
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:46,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know.

428
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,979
[SPEAKER_07]: There's limits, and I think that's a bit much.

429
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,143
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, then we won't have games anymore if everybody goes batshit crazy about pirating.

430
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:57,186
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I don't know.

431
00:35:57,226 --> 00:36:01,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be afraid of some of this other stuff of just, like, screwing my console, especially, like, 360.

432
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I have lots of XBLA games I've bought.

433
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:05,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

434
00:36:20,486 --> 00:36:45,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been into chipping or modding systems since the PS1 and the Dreamcast after that era I stopped doesn't mean I'm not still interested in that community but just as far as the the consoles have just gotten too expensive for me to you know open it up and you know I'm not a whiz with a soldering iron as I once was so I'd probably break the hell out of it but yeah I find these stories really interesting but I haven't been into modding or any of that stuff in a while

435
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:49,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say I would support trying to get around region locking.

436
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, a comment in chat room made me think about that.

437
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:55,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray Ayanami says, I could have hacked my US 360, then I would have had to get a Japanese one.

438
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, then I wouldn't have had to get a Japanese one.

439
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:06,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And that kind of made me think, you know, yeah, getting around region locking, I think, I don't understand region locking, but that's... I do, I understand why they do it.

440
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:07,946
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean I support it.

441
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's coming up later in the show, we'll get to it, but...

442
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:17,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not forget, and I know somebody's going to say it if I don't, PS3, of course, is not region locked, so I can't.

443
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:19,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's good, though, because it is good.

444
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:37,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what comes down to it, and I think that when you remove functionality like that, and it's not even necessarily removing it because a lot of the consoles in the past did not have, they weren't region free, but nonetheless, if you remove or do not have features like it being region free, I don't think

445
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

446
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PS3, actually, I think that's why it's taken so long.

447
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because it had Linux enabled on it from the beginning, and it was region-free.

448
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:04,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you need to hack the system?

449
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:08,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Because most people are trying to install Homebrew or play stuff from other regions.

450
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was all there.

451
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:14,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they didn't remove the region locking, but they removed Linux.

452
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And once they removed Linux, people took interest in trying to get that back because people don't like things that are taken away from them.

453
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:23,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to throw it out there.

454
00:38:23,193 --> 00:38:28,019
[SPEAKER_07]: If the Wii wasn't region locked, we could have totally made President Cat sell more than 100 copies.

455
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

456
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,984
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember that whole debacle from like two years ago.

457
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:33,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

458
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Two years ago?

459
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:37,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about at least a year and a half, not two years ago.

460
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:37,891
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a while.

461
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:46,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, if that's it for the hacking stuff, I just wanted to know, I found it interesting that dude was on Attack of the Show and all this stuff.

462
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:48,018
[SPEAKER_07]: He's become this E-list celebrity now.

463
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:52,461
[SPEAKER_06]: He's big in the iPhone community.

464
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:55,884
[SPEAKER_06]: He came up with the jailbreak stuff.

465
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:56,464
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty big.

466
00:38:57,901 --> 00:38:59,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let me go to some other stories here.

467
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:03,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of getting into other legal-ish type of things.

468
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I don't think this is going to end up being a lawsuit.

469
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:14,566
[SPEAKER_07]: There was this whole back and forth between Capcom Mobile this week and the folks that made Explosion Man, Twisted Pixel.

470
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:20,793
[SPEAKER_07]: and it has to do with the game Maxplosion which came out for the iPhone which of course was released to iTunes.

471
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to Explosion Man.

472
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:27,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Both feature little red demons kind of running around.

473
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:30,925
[SPEAKER_07]: They're even like similar names doing similar things.

474
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:36,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so Capcom Mobile took a little bit of heat this week for doing that.

475
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:45,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And so much that the Twisted Pixel programmer Mike Henry on his Twitter account said, "...Maxplosion gameplay video makes me sad.

476
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:49,106
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to outright steal a game, you should at least understand what makes it fun."

477
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:57,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Another note to this is that Twisted Pixel had actually once met with Capcom about getting them to distribute Explosion Man.

478
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom passed, so for them to do something like this was especially insulting.

479
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Capcom had to put out some fires of their own.

480
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:06,575
[SPEAKER_07]: They, of course, were, quote, saddened.

481
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:09,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you how sad in this little statement.

482
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:36,530
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sorry.

483
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:38,091
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sorry.

484
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:50,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how it completely dodges the fact, though, that the game is a total, like, you know, I don't want to say ripoff, but heavily influenced by Splosion Man.

485
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:50,983
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

486
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:51,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

487
00:40:51,644 --> 00:40:54,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That press release totally dodges that part of it.

488
00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:55,167
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

489
00:40:55,587 --> 00:41:00,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Capcom Mobile, they have different employees and they're in a different building than Capcom.

490
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:04,396
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't ever work with Capcom console people at all.

491
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:11,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, God, they wouldn't be working with those teams when they poured over their crappy ports of games onto the iPhone or whatever.

492
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:13,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for Dead Rising with four zombies in it.

493
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're telling me that these people have no communication.

494
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the whole Coke Zero, Coke thing.

495
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:26,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people are reading a little too much into what TwistedPixel said.

496
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, I believe Capcom, what they're saying.

497
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of times these big companies, especially international companies, tend to work in little silos.

498
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:42,037
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't think that the Capcom division said one to another, hey, we got presented this little game.

499
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should try to... I don't think that ever happened.

500
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I think did happen.

501
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:49,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Explosion Man's been out for a good six months now.

502
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:53,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some people in the mobile division played it and said, we want to do a game like this on the iPhone.

503
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:57,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't think it was ever one of those like...

504
00:41:58,151 --> 00:42:00,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make it shadier than it already is shady.

505
00:42:00,592 --> 00:42:01,112
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

506
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's face it, folks.

507
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at this and I go, this is news?

508
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:05,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

509
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Games ripping each other off?

510
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:09,414
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been happening forever.

511
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:11,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially on the iPhone.

512
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Gameloft.

513
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:18,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, ironically enough, Street Fighter 2, how many times was that game ripped off?

514
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:21,122
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

515
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:45,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to the gamers to reject the crap.

516
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:51,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you think that this is a crappy derivative of Splosion Man, don't buy it.

517
00:42:51,645 --> 00:42:55,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't support the ripoff and don't buy it.

518
00:42:56,107 --> 00:43:02,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute, I guess, in some ways that Capcom's being called out on this, but I really don't think Capcom's alone in what they're doing.

519
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:05,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I think every game company out there is guilty of doing it at some point.

520
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:07,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Name me a company.

521
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's a ripoff game they've done at some point.

522
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:15,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of any.

523
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm not taking that literally.

524
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:29,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not trying to profess to be this encyclopedia of games or whatever, but I'm sure most big companies at one point or another have ripped off another game or allowed a game to heavily influence what they're doing.

525
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:32,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and yeah, some comments from our chat room here.

526
00:43:33,382 --> 00:43:35,323
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTipsia says, great Gianna sisters.

527
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:41,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, that ended up getting pulled from shelves, so that was a little too close.

528
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming out in DS in February.

529
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:43,891
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

530
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:08,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Sky, Bricks on the Ground, Goomba Looking Monsters, Bricks that Turn into Coins.

531
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:11,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, damn, it was really, really just like Mario.

532
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Little power-ups that make you get bigger.

533
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:16,361
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was pretty much a Mario Brothers ripoff.

534
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:40,503
[SPEAKER_07]: ironically enough when you get into later levels there are some kind of different mechanics that do set the game apart a little bit but here's the thing the reason why people remember that game so fondly it wasn't necessarily the game itself but it had a kick-ass soundtrack like you've ever heard the soundtrack to Great Giana Sisters and a lot of the Commodore 64 music you still hear that influence today I mean bit chiptune bit music all of it is influenced by Commodore 64 stuff all of it

535
00:44:42,550 --> 00:45:07,690
[SPEAKER_07]: and so there was such great music that came out of that Commodore 64 era and Great Gianna Sisters I think is fondly remembered because yeah it was a rip-off of a game it had an awesome soundtrack so uh Dark Titsy also brings up Casey Munchkin which was uh that was an Odyssey game there was a total rip-off of Pac-Man yep uh GameGuru says Capcom even sued for fighters history at that time they lost it's kind of interesting what games are considered too close and what games aren't hmm

536
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, by the way, in our chatroom says, Loki, I know a guy that works at Gameloft.

537
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,775
[SPEAKER_07]: He pretty much has told some friends and me that they pretty much rip off games and just make some cosmetic changes.

538
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:23,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Gameloft had a Castlevania Symphony of the Night rip off they were going to release a few years ago, but they canceled it.

539
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:32,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing though, to Gameloft's credit, some of their games are actually pretty good.

540
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, they're not the most original thing, but damn, for what it's running on, it's pretty good.

541
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Problem is...

542
00:45:41,528 --> 00:45:54,480
[SPEAKER_06]: When they go to develop on consoles, they don't really learn that, okay, I can't put out a... Well, you can put out a Modern Warfare 2 clone, but no one's gonna give a shit because it's on consoles now.

543
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as impressive as making it run on the iPhone or whatever.

544
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:03,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, their ports, I mean, or whatever, they aren't terrible.

545
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I haven't played all of them, but...

546
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:13,195
[SPEAKER_06]: They look, compared to some of the Angry Bird clones and stuff like that, it could be a lot worse.

547
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny enough, if Gameloft had put out a version of Explosion Man, do you think it would have necessitated all these stories on GameBlogs this week?

548
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:21,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

549
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:29,541
[SPEAKER_06]: It was funny, though, because they did have a story that didn't make our show roll, but Gameloft was saying, we don't rip games off.

550
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:34,803
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just a limited amount of genres that we can use, so a lot of games look similar.

551
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:43,727
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm sorry, that is a bunch of shit Do you know why this, I think, got traction and is all over the news?

552
00:46:43,827 --> 00:47:01,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's Capcom, and they expect better from Capcom Exactly, because Capcom, I think, has always been seen as They're one of us, they're friends with the community They're letting the people design Mega Man Legends 3 They're the good guys I'd expect better from Capcom, the console game manufacturer

553
00:47:02,276 --> 00:47:30,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom Mobile, their stuff is shit that's true, the Mega Man game on iPhone, shit, absolute shit Dead Rising, terrible Devil May Cry I haven't actually played it yet but I'm sorry, it probably won't be good so no, I don't expect much better from Capcom Mobile now Capcom though, if they actually put out an Xbox Live Arcade game of Maxplosion then I'd be a little sad now you're acknowledging that they're separate divisions

554
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:33,226
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I'm saying.

555
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:34,707
[SPEAKER_06]: It's their words.

556
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're talking to each other.

557
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:41,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a mass conspiracy, the steel explosion, man.

558
00:47:42,848 --> 00:47:43,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not anything like that.

559
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:49,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just they make crappy games in their mobile department.

560
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:50,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

561
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,811
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

562
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:59,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see who's accusing who of ripping someone off next, and we'll go to another news story from SalaciousPod.

563
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:09,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Champions Online, which came out in September of 2009, some brief 15-16 months ago, is going free to play.

564
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:14,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Lord of the Rings Online was the most recent major MMO to do this.

565
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:18,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Champions Online will be going free to play starting January 25th.

566
00:48:19,493 --> 00:48:25,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You can download the client and create your superhero or your villain and go along your crime-fighting way.

567
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:39,851
[SPEAKER_09]: When it gets relaunched on the 25th, it is getting a new title, Champions Online Free-for-All, which sounds like it might be an expansion, but that's just what they're rebranding it for the free-to-play model.

568
00:48:40,772 --> 00:48:41,833
[SPEAKER_09]: This story is kind of...

569
00:48:43,535 --> 00:48:44,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

570
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:45,096
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next time.

571
00:49:04,973 --> 00:49:19,221
[SPEAKER_09]: and it was going to be the first MMO that had PC and Xbox 360 support where you could have an account I think that worked on both platforms and a month or two before release

572
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:47,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft pulled the plug on the Xbox Live component of the MMO so right before they launched they already had potentially 50% of their game base taken away from them it became PC only and it floundered it never really took off, it kind of flopped actually so this isn't surprising to me at all I'm surprised that they're actually going free to play because for me it would seem that now they would be able to bring it to Xbox Live

573
00:49:48,536 --> 00:49:55,160
[SPEAKER_06]: because before they had, for some reason, the infrastructure with MMOs and stuff and subscriptions, they couldn't do it.

574
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but I call bullshit on Microsoft.

575
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:01,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI came out like six months after the Xbox was out.

576
00:50:01,784 --> 00:50:03,365
[SPEAKER_07]: They were able to do this shit for years.

577
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:05,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then why haven't there been any MMOs on the console yet?

578
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:07,307
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a damn good question.

579
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:09,248
[SPEAKER_07]: One I think Microsoft needs to answer.

580
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:11,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI did this shit.

581
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:14,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It was PC and 360 and PlayStation 2 for fuck's sake.

582
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:17,070
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why I don't think that there's been any MMOs?

583
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there haven't really been any MMOs on consoles yet.

584
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:25,852
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, now with Sony releasing like DC Universe and they're going to have the agency some year.

585
00:50:27,253 --> 00:50:31,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV, which... Well, eventually Final Fantasy XIV, but...

586
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:35,677
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if that stuff takes off, though, they're gonna have to compete.

587
00:50:35,757 --> 00:50:47,670
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, they had the MMO, Sony didn't have anything, and so now, you know, and Final Fantasy XI, I don't think, did too well for them on 360, because, you know... Because it had already been out for...

588
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

589
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:26,632
[SPEAKER_07]: it was awesome bought it because we had the PC version but sometimes we wanted to play it on our TV and it did look really good on the TV I'm not gonna lie like if I was still into playing Final Fantasy 11 I'd probably be playing it on the 360 with my current setup at home where I just live by myself now and I could be using my TV as a giant computer like that I would totally be playing Final Fantasy 11 on the Xbox 360 if I was still playing that game

590
00:51:28,237 --> 00:51:53,569
[SPEAKER_06]: it it it you know if that game went free to play yeah I gotta admit if Final Fantasy 11 went free to play I'd go back I'd go back and if all my characters were still there I'd be on like that I would download the client I'd be on tomorrow I would I'm not gonna lie that that's scary that that's a scary thought let's see if they did that bye bye 14 it doesn't even matter don't even release it just forget it it just don't even worry about it just finish keep adding to 11

591
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:55,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's scary.

592
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:26,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So you knew that when this game came out, it was ready to come out on the Xbox.

593
00:52:27,168 --> 00:52:33,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And even on the PC version, you plug in an Xbox controller, and you can see how much better the game is with an Xbox controller.

594
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,031
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of how I feel about DC Universe.

595
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:39,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironically enough, these two games are somewhat similar in the whole superhero in the making thing.

596
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:46,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if this happening is somewhat of a response to DC Universe now entering the market.

597
00:52:47,315 --> 00:52:49,536
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like quite a few people are jumping on board here.

598
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:56,660
[SPEAKER_07]: and having played the beta test of the PC version of DC Universe, man, it was so much better when I plugged in the controller and did it that way.

599
00:52:57,461 --> 00:53:02,144
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you download the client and you create your free account, you can play.

600
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:12,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It's adopting sort of a freemium model where if you want to pay for the additional costume packs or the weapons or...

601
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:41,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Powers or whatever you can pay a la carte for that however if you're into the game enough that you're willing to pay a $14.99 subscription which is what it is right now you will automatically get that stuff as soon as it's available you'll have everything so they're still offering a subscription based service for people that are into the game enough that they want all the goodies or you can just play it you know have it run with your WoW account

602
00:53:42,334 --> 00:54:05,335
[SPEAKER_09]: do the if you see one particular expansion that you like pay for it a la carte and otherwise it's free so yeah hopefully hopefully this will help the game out because I really like the superhero genre and this game I feel never really got a chance to succeed because of what Microsoft did too do you have any speaking of the superhero genre do you have any interest in DC Universe Online now that it's out um

603
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:15,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if this is pretentious or what, but just the fact that it's DC, like if Marvel came out with an MMO, I'd feel the same way.

604
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:17,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't like the big names.

605
00:54:17,425 --> 00:54:27,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Because City of Heroes has a huge RP community in it because it's so customizable and it's not attached to any known license like DC is.

606
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:30,216
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm going to check this out now, now that it's free to play.

607
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Champions Online, absolutely.

608
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:32,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get it.

609
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:33,406
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

610
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you'll have to come back and let us know how it is.

611
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:35,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

612
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:36,408
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

613
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

614
00:54:38,548 --> 00:54:38,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

615
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:40,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

616
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:48,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's no surprise that one of the best games to be released for the Kinect has sold 1 million units in the U.S.

617
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:55,796
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be Dance Central and also Kinect Sports, both those games breaking the 1 million unit mark.

618
00:54:56,917 --> 00:55:01,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the Kinect hardware has sold 8 million units worldwide.

619
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:21,343
[SPEAKER_06]: and also it's kind of neat to mention and I don't think a lot of people know this yet but in case you haven't picked up Dance Central or you're thinking of picking it up and you may want to wait a little bit because they're actually going to be doing a new SKU that's going to be coming out to the market soon that will give you I guess your first piece of download content for free.

620
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:26,184
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to include a code for 240 Microsoft points bundled into the box.

621
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:27,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

622
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:57,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so funny because last night I was out at the club and they were playing actually a couple songs that I recognize from Dance Central like Evacuate the Dance Floor.

623
00:55:57,871 --> 00:56:01,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So when Evacuate the Dance Floor started playing, I actually kind of started doing this in my seat.

624
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Evacuate the dance.

625
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:06,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I was doing the whole little dance from the game.

626
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:07,882
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what that was.

627
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:08,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought you were drunk.

628
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:09,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know.

629
00:56:09,984 --> 00:56:10,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that song so much.

630
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you want me.

631
00:56:37,104 --> 00:56:38,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I want you.

632
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:41,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I want you.

633
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,471
[SPEAKER_09]: The routine's pretty fun, though.

634
00:56:51,343 --> 00:56:58,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, that's the thing about Dance Central is that as stinking cheesy as those dances are, you kind of start to remember them after you've played the game enough times.

635
00:56:59,031 --> 00:57:01,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm tempted to do it on the dance floor and I feel like a dumbass.

636
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's really weird.

637
00:57:03,495 --> 00:57:05,117
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a lot of jumping around.

638
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:08,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

639
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, something that won't be as easy to dance to and you really, really should not reenact in real life at all.

640
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:26,064
[SPEAKER_07]: The kind of, I guess you could say the, I don't know, very hard R rated Mortal Kombat episodes that are going to be coming out soon.

641
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:34,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you might remember there was this little YouTube clip some time ago that was like a concept video for a Mortal Kombat movie reboot.

642
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:37,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like, imagine if Mortal Kombat went all Saw.

643
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:38,347
[SPEAKER_07]: on you.

644
00:57:38,868 --> 00:57:39,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really violent.

645
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:41,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And some big names were in this.

646
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:42,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I want to say, what?

647
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:43,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Jai White.

648
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:46,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Jai White was Jax, and Tits of Nine, what's her name?

649
00:57:47,752 --> 00:57:48,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Sonia.

650
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:51,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Jerry Ryan was Sonia in this.

651
00:57:52,394 --> 00:57:52,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah.

652
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:55,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, they're not going to make it a movie.

653
00:57:55,616 --> 00:57:56,577
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not happening.

654
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:59,339
[SPEAKER_07]: But what is going to happen, there's going to be some webisodes.

655
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,361
[SPEAKER_07]: A 10-part Mortal Kombat webisode series.

656
00:58:02,882 --> 00:58:06,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this is somewhat to promote the new games that are coming out.

657
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:07,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder if that will somehow work together.

658
00:58:08,346 --> 00:58:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Jai White is going to come back as Jax.

659
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:17,132
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the website Bloody Disgusting that reported on this, because that's a website all about the gore movies, basically.

660
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:19,554
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say a whole lot about the storyline.

661
00:58:19,614 --> 00:58:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So I imagine this is all just a part to kind of like pump up the release of the game.

662
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:25,919
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't know a whole lot outside of that.

663
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess it's neat.

664
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:29,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not into the uber violence.

665
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:34,026
[SPEAKER_07]: You see, like I like Mortal Kombat because it's cartoony violence.

666
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Like cartoony violence is funny to me.

667
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:38,710
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't like the Saw movies.

668
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That just crosses the line to me.

669
00:58:41,753 --> 00:58:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how I feel about this whole thing.

670
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:46,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I a hypocrite?

671
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:50,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I a hypocrite because I like Mortal Kombat but I don't like Saw?

672
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:52,844
[SPEAKER_09]: A little.

673
00:58:53,185 --> 00:58:53,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a little bit.

674
00:58:54,026 --> 00:58:54,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

675
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:56,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really thought about it too much.

676
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:59,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator says anyone remember the short lived Mortal Kombat TV show back in the 90s?

677
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:20,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was an interesting... I remember that show.

678
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:30,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the network here that is now the CW that used to just show all the... You know, before there was a CW network, they would show all the... UPN!

679
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:30,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

680
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:32,079
[SPEAKER_07]: No, even before that.

681
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:35,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this show was on, I want to say, in the early... No, I guess it was... It was UPN.

682
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It was UPN at the time, that's right.

683
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was just funny.

684
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:45,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we'll see what becomes of this Mortal Kombat as we get closer to the game coming out.

685
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:47,843
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, we move on with more news.

686
00:59:49,024 --> 00:59:49,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Slash pop.

687
00:59:51,565 --> 01:00:10,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so Capcom is coming out with a system for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 where if you do the versus online mode and you're playing some stranger and he dunks on you really bad and the only reason why he didn't get a perfect on your ass is because you got in some block damage and you say screw this and quit...

688
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:23,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're going to eventually rally up enough rage quit points or whatever that you're going to be thrown into other random battles with other rage quitters to discourage that type of behavior.

689
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:26,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that is...

690
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:55,827
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting I believe in Tatsunoko versus Capcom for the Wii they have a similar system if you enter a random battle leave in the middle of it because you're losing then once you finally get someone that you can win a round on um they'll rage quit on you and you guys can just all rage quit on each other while the more serious competitors will you know take their random battles more seriously I guess so yeah that's um that story uh came out uh last week and uh

691
01:00:57,389 --> 01:00:58,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sounds interesting.

692
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they'd do this in WoW.

693
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:01,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish they'd do this in Grand Theft Auto.

694
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Does everyone seem to like this idea?

695
01:01:04,637 --> 01:01:06,579
[SPEAKER_07]: What if the rage quitting is beyond your control, though?

696
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,742
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it's like a legit connection failure?

697
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:15,269
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're out in the boonies and you only have like maybe satellite as your only broadband option, then yeah, that might suck for you.

698
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:20,780
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, you're still a problem for the people you're trying to play against.

699
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,741
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still dropping out all the time, so maybe you do need to be paired with the rage quitters.

700
01:01:23,761 --> 01:01:26,802
[SPEAKER_09]: To the person that you're playing against, they don't know that you dropped out.

701
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:29,363
[SPEAKER_09]: They just think you're a rage quitter anyway, so it's still your problem.

702
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:41,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, at our work, we usually have that issue with Grand Theft Auto matches and stuff, but I would think that they would know that I'm not rage quitting because I'm kicking the fucking ass out of them, and I'm in first place, and then I drop.

703
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:44,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, oh, damn it, I'm doing too good, I'm leaving.

704
01:01:47,629 --> 01:02:13,655
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe a little bit just a tad let's travel around the world and look at release dates for games that are coming out soon more games that you can rage quit in yes this week is not too busy but it doesn't fucking matter because there's only really one game you should pick up and that would be LittleBigPlanet 2 very excited that this game is coming out and I can dust off my PS3 finally and play this game so it's pretty awesome

705
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:20,658
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't played this game yet too, on PlayStation 3 as well, Mass Effect 2 will be making its way out.

706
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:28,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's slightly polished Mass Effect 3 engine along with all the download content.

707
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:29,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

708
01:02:29,601 --> 01:02:30,802
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be out this week as well.

709
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, some other fun stuff coming out this week.

710
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:38,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants vs. Zombies on Nintendo DS, which is a pretty awesome game.

711
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:41,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Mindjack is actually kind of a neat looking game.

712
01:02:41,874 --> 01:02:44,518
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on PlayStation 3 and 360 from Square Enix.

713
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:50,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, getting some comparisons to Demon's Souls actually, except for the, I don't think it's supposed to be...

714
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:53,707
[SPEAKER_06]: to the point where you want to blow your brains out hard.

715
01:02:55,709 --> 01:03:03,495
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it's one of those games that has a persistent online portion of it where you can jump into other people's games and play as the villains.

716
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

717
01:03:05,617 --> 01:03:06,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that idea.

718
01:03:07,038 --> 01:03:10,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that's something that's coming out this week, which is pretty cool.

719
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:11,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

720
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:14,359
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?

721
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Spellforce 2 Faith and Destiny.

722
01:03:16,661 --> 01:03:19,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's a PC title that's coming out this week, as well as Veneticon PC.

723
01:03:19,723 --> 01:03:20,844
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a little bit of a holdover.

724
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:22,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's it.

725
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:23,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, yeah, small week.

726
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:25,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Demon's Souls 2 Demon's Souls 2 Demon's Souls 2

727
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:52,300
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mindjack sounds interesting.

728
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:55,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say I'd check it out, but unfortunately games cost $60.

729
01:03:56,424 --> 01:03:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm not able to rent it first or try it, I don't know.

730
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:00,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it some time.

731
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:06,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is going to be a game that's packed in between LittleBigPlanet 2 and Dead Space 2.

732
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:11,137
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people aren't going to realize that this game is out and they'll probably drop the price rather quick.

733
01:04:12,038 --> 01:04:12,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

734
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.

735
01:04:15,343 --> 01:04:22,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Connect Joyride coming out on the 360 as well as Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom both come out on the 20th of this month on 360.

736
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:27,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're getting some of their Connect localized titles a little later than we had them here.

737
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,261
[SPEAKER_07]: That also comes out, by the way, on the PlayStation 3.

738
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:33,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Kinect, of course, but Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom comes out from Namco Bandai.

739
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:41,386
[SPEAKER_07]: This game, I'm trying to think if I've heard of this here in the U.S., and I know I've seen a trailer for this, and it actually looks pretty awesome.

740
01:04:41,446 --> 01:04:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what is this game called here?

741
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:44,267
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

742
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Namco, and it's like Overworld.

743
01:04:47,228 --> 01:04:48,989
[SPEAKER_07]: You have this little giant following you.

744
01:04:49,009 --> 01:04:51,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom.

745
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:52,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this called the same game here?

746
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:54,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it came out over the end of November.

747
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:55,492
What?

748
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:56,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed this game?

749
01:04:56,713 --> 01:04:57,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you did.

750
01:04:57,253 --> 01:04:58,994
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks kind of neat.

751
01:04:59,054 --> 01:05:00,235
[SPEAKER_07]: How well received was it?

752
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:00,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

753
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:01,755
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks kind of cool.

754
01:05:01,775 --> 01:05:03,496
[SPEAKER_06]: But it dropped in price a bunch of times.

755
01:05:03,536 --> 01:05:03,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it?

756
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:05,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, right before it came out.

757
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:07,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was only a $40 game.

758
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:08,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to check that out.

759
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So many games came out at the end of last year.

760
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally missed that.

761
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, it was that and Spider House were the same week.

762
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:17,704
[SPEAKER_06]: People kind of forgot about it because, you know, was it...

763
01:05:20,763 --> 01:05:28,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Operation Black, Black Ops, something like that, yeah, and Assassin something or other, Creed, Brotherhood, yeah.

764
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:40,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, also coming out on PlayStation 3, this is a price reduction of a game that's already been out, it comes in the best series now, it's Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu Wu Sugumono.

765
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:46,842
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know this game as Yakuza 4, that's the same game there, and that's getting a big price reduction on the PlayStation 3 this week.

766
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to some other systems like the Nintendo Wii.

767
01:05:51,004 --> 01:05:55,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo Wii has Sengoku Mosou 3 gets a price reduction this week.

768
01:05:55,726 --> 01:06:02,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And Momotaro Densetsu 2010 Sengoku Isshin no Hiro Dasyugo gets a price.

769
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:05,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a price reduction as well this week.

770
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots and lots of things getting cheaper.

771
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm trying to see what this game is.

772
01:06:08,772 --> 01:06:12,473
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like kind of like a, I guess, train station simulator.

773
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,974
[SPEAKER_07]: These train games are very popular over there in Japan.

774
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:16,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's another train simulator game.

775
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:45,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That is getting a price reduction there Starting to see some stuff for the 3DS forming in Japan But can't talk about it until February 26th But that's starting to show up on my list So that's kind of exciting But if you want to go back to the regular DS Zombie Daisuke comes out this week As well as yet another price reduction for Gaikuten Kenje comes out Also Plants vs. Zombies I guess comes out in the US this week And that is actually getting some import over in Japan Believe it or not

776
01:06:46,738 --> 01:07:15,750
[SPEAKER_07]: also a huge huge release on the PSP this week Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix so it's like kind of like the game redone with the extra stuff including anything we got here in the US that they didn't get over there one other game on the PSP to mention Venus and Braves Majo to Megami to Horiobi no Yogen comes out from Bandai Namco this week as well so there you go Venus Braves by the way is what that series is known as

777
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,024
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for Japanese releases.

778
01:07:18,044 --> 01:07:18,488
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the UK?

779
01:07:19,857 --> 01:07:32,708
[SPEAKER_09]: For UK releases, I'm going to take it back a couple days just to remind everybody in the great old Britain that DC Universe Online came out on the 14th on both PC and PlayStation 3.

780
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:36,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And also a game called Ghost Trick for the DS.

781
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,013
[SPEAKER_09]: That was January 14th.

782
01:07:38,714 --> 01:07:42,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And Kingdom Hearts Recoded as well on the DS on the January 14th.

783
01:07:43,217 --> 01:07:46,300
[SPEAKER_09]: For this upcoming week, we have on the January 17th

784
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:49,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday Night Combat for the PC.

785
01:07:51,563 --> 01:08:02,374
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 21st, we have LittleBigPlanet 2 for the PS3, Mass Effect 2 for the PS3, and MindJack for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

786
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:04,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And that wraps up all of next week.

787
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:06,017
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on the 21st.

788
01:08:06,658 --> 01:08:35,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny about those releases is that I almost pretty much heard the same stuff when Loki was talking and you don't see that a lot is that the UK and the US are kind of getting a lot of releases Usually the UK will get their stuff late Yeah, so that's pretty cool that a lot of the stuff is coming out in tandem so if I were living overseas I'd be pretty happy right now to hear that Alright, well let's move on with a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week I know Dark Sakura is not here tonight but we've got a plan B, don't worry We're going to get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit but first, two more news stories for you guys

789
01:08:36,339 --> 01:08:44,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, unfortunately, the Wii always gets shit on when it comes to download content, and that seems to be what's going on this time.

790
01:08:44,483 --> 01:08:54,947
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rock Band Network, which is releasing a bunch of indie tracks on the Xbox 360, and I believe they were getting a few ported over to the PS3 and Wii.

791
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to stop, at least on the Wii.

792
01:08:58,588 --> 01:09:02,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, with a smaller install base, limited demand for releases so far, and the submission

793
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:09,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Significant amount of work it takes for our producers and audio team to convert and process these additional tracks.

794
01:09:10,572 --> 01:09:16,113
[SPEAKER_06]: We are no longer able to continue submitting Rockman Network content to the Wii.

795
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:21,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So to summarize, or in other words, no one's fucking buying it so we're going to stop making it.

796
01:09:21,754 --> 01:09:21,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

797
01:09:22,314 --> 01:09:27,795
[SPEAKER_06]: It says regular Wii DLC and Rockman Network releases for the 360 and PS3 will continue uninterrupted.

798
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:56,756
[SPEAKER_07]: honestly truthfully I think the Wii owners are lucky to be getting any DLC at all like with how crappy Nintendo's online front end is compared to their competitors I am I honestly think Harmonix is graceful and generous in the amount of content that they do put out on the Wii and like I realize that a lot of people own a Wii and a lot of people have this game on the Wii but I think they they more than support their game like better than probably any other fucking company does on the Wii

799
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:01,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least on the Wii, though, you get some Rock Band stuff this week on the 18th.

800
01:10:01,519 --> 01:10:16,288
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the main drag, How We Look on Paper, Wounded Soul, RX, Band of Horses, The Great Salt Lake, Firewind, Head Up High, Seton Clausen and the Soul Side, White Heat, and OK Go with White Knuckles.

801
01:10:16,988 --> 01:10:18,249
[SPEAKER_06]: OK Go is pretty awesome.

802
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:22,932
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

803
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:26,429
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

804
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:51,749
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

805
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:37,514
[SPEAKER_07]: and it looks like the way this works is a lot of the words kind of show up on the bottom of the screen so you can kind of touch them to put the words in and what have you yeah that's basically the deal so I man that's great if I had an iPad I'd be checking that out right now in fact I might try it on my iPhone but I'm guessing it doesn't work nearly as well because you don't have quite the same real estate so there you go

806
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:42,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how they're getting away with this.

807
01:11:42,724 --> 01:11:47,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's just kind of one of those until they get the cease and desist letter, they're just going to do it.

808
01:11:47,348 --> 01:11:49,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Or once it's on the internet, everybody has it.

809
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:50,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

810
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:52,993
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, wait for iPad 2.

811
01:11:53,053 --> 01:11:54,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with electric boogaloo.

812
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:56,576
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from our chatroom, chat.orangeeyesradio.com.

813
01:11:56,916 --> 01:12:00,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to actually wait for iPad 2.

814
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:06,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to wait for that because it'll have the front-facing cam and all the other frills and stuff.

815
01:12:07,632 --> 01:12:10,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoy whenever we go to the mall and we pass the Apple store.

816
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:12,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, hey, Rob, go get your iPad.

817
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:13,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Just impulse buy it right now.

818
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:15,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Drop the 600 bones.

819
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:15,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

820
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,041
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these days, I'm going to do it.

821
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:18,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're going to be like, I was kidding.

822
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:21,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't really mean for that to happen.

823
01:12:22,048 --> 01:12:26,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, when the iPad 2 is announced, the prices of those iPad 1s are going to plummet.

824
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they're going to go down to $200, $300.

825
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:34,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I have so many friends that work at the Apple mothership down in, where is that?

826
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:35,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know.

827
01:12:35,993 --> 01:12:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, all your friends work there, shouldn't you know?

828
01:12:39,434 --> 01:12:40,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Cupertino.

829
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:41,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Cupertino, the one infinity loop.

830
01:12:41,675 --> 01:12:45,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And whenever the new generation of iPods come out,

831
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:49,839
[SPEAKER_09]: within their internal employee store because they get markdowns on that.

832
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:50,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Dirt cheap.

833
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gotten two iPods that way.

834
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:53,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

835
01:12:53,062 --> 01:12:55,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll try and... Well, except you'll want a new one.

836
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:57,265
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I want one of the new fancy pants ones.

837
01:12:57,305 --> 01:12:58,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want that old shit.

838
01:12:58,326 --> 01:12:59,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the new ones.

839
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:04,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do drunken FaceTime because that's the only reason you use FaceTime is when you're rip-roaring drunk, which I didn't do last night, oddly enough.

840
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:08,473
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, FaceTime is best for drunk dialing.

841
01:13:08,654 --> 01:13:10,775
[SPEAKER_07]: It's drunk dialing for a new century is what it is.

842
01:13:11,616 --> 01:13:13,037
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

843
01:13:15,619 --> 01:13:21,365
[SPEAKER_06]: To answer your question, yes, you can play it on an iPod, but it's hard.

844
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:22,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it hard?

845
01:13:23,187 --> 01:13:26,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It's small because you have to type in text on the bottom here.

846
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:27,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yuck.

847
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:28,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can do it.

848
01:13:28,732 --> 01:13:31,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You can click around and stuff because it supports Safari.

849
01:13:31,555 --> 01:13:32,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's pretty cool.

850
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:34,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I got sucked through.

851
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:34,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, that sucked.

852
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:35,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's too bad.

853
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, question from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com live here on this Sunday evening.

854
01:13:41,443 --> 01:13:43,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, are you going to wait for the 3DSi?

855
01:13:44,646 --> 01:13:53,492
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm getting the 3DS right when it comes out and I bet a lot of you skeptic folks the first time you see the 3DS you're going to be like, holy shit, it really is 3D without glasses and you'll probably buy it too.

856
01:13:55,112 --> 01:14:19,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really not trying to sound like a fanboy don't get me wrong, Nintendo pisses me off more than they usually make me happy but the 3DS it's a pretty fantastic piece of technology I'm almost excited to get it for and I know this is going to sound weird because I'm usually not a fan of 3D movies but the 3D on the DS doesn't really bother me I'm excited to see what kind of 3D movies come out on the DS if Tron Legacy comes out in 3D on the DS on the 3DS I'm there, hello

857
01:14:24,023 --> 01:14:25,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, don't you want that?

858
01:14:27,785 --> 01:14:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yes, I want that.

859
01:14:29,646 --> 01:14:32,887
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

860
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:38,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Here at Orange Lounge Radio, we do a segment every week called the classic game of the week, and it has a little theme song.

861
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:44,913
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the part of the week where DarkSakura dives into her vault and she drags out a classic video game.

862
01:14:44,933 --> 01:14:45,493
[SPEAKER_07]: She says, hey!

863
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:46,945
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

864
01:15:05,623 --> 01:15:11,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So we thought maybe Salacious Pop could pick something that DarkSakura maybe would not pick.

865
01:15:11,164 --> 01:15:15,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I made sure that I'm not stepping on DarkSakura's toes on the whole console classic.

866
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:21,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So I picked a PC classic, namely King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella.

867
01:15:21,806 --> 01:15:23,487
[SPEAKER_07]: How appropriate considering the last story.

868
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:25,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Off of the Sierra Online story we just finished up.

869
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:27,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful choice.

870
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if we can get some music here.

871
01:15:32,509 --> 01:15:33,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

872
01:15:53,431 --> 01:15:54,552
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

873
01:16:10,888 --> 01:16:11,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Insert Disk 7.

874
01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:13,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a game like that.

875
01:16:15,212 --> 01:16:28,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I loved this game because it was the last in the King's Quest series that used the traditional text-based input system, like look under bridge, throw ball, search room, all that stuff.

876
01:16:28,805 --> 01:16:33,750
[SPEAKER_09]: King's Quest 5 adopted the new mouse cursor engine.

877
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:42,616
[SPEAKER_09]: So King's Quest 4, the last traditional text-based King's Quest game, takes place immediately after the events of King's Quest 3.

878
01:16:43,616 --> 01:16:48,580
[SPEAKER_09]: You play Rosella, the daughter of King Gram of Daventry.

879
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,902
[SPEAKER_09]: King Gram in the opening sequence has a heart attack.

880
01:16:52,162 --> 01:17:00,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The magic mirror tells you that you need to be ported away to a magical world, to Tamir, to find this fruit.

881
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:03,050
[SPEAKER_09]: And if King Gram can eat the fruit, he will not die.

882
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,932
[SPEAKER_09]: and this game had an internal timer.

883
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:12,337
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to get the fruit and make it back to King Graham within a certain amount of game time or else he would die and it would be game over.

884
01:17:12,457 --> 01:17:14,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So you had to figure out the puzzles relatively quickly.

885
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:19,282
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point it turned to night and everything got dark.

886
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:22,104
[SPEAKER_09]: There were certain puzzles that you could only beat.

887
01:17:22,445 --> 01:17:24,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's an abandoned mansion.

888
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:32,112
[SPEAKER_09]: There was nothing to do there unless you went there at night when it was haunted because the puzzles didn't light up until it was dark.

889
01:17:32,252 --> 01:17:32,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So you had to

890
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: you know do everything else and then that was the last place you went to while it was still nightfall it had multiple endings it was possible to survive the dangers of Tamir and escape the evil witch Lolote and make it back to King Graham without actually getting the fruit

891
01:17:55,726 --> 01:18:09,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So you had to be able to figure out where it was, what items you needed to get the item and then survive the antagonist, the evil witch, and then give him the food in the end.

892
01:18:09,777 --> 01:18:12,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, it had multiple endings, which was pretty innovative at the time.

893
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:19,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I think EGA graphics, but the pixels were a lot smaller than the traditional King's Quest games.

894
01:18:19,885 --> 01:18:24,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So visually, even for EGA graphics, 16 color, stunning.

895
01:18:25,029 --> 01:18:33,074
[SPEAKER_09]: and the music, of course, with the King's Quest 4, I believe, was one of the first Sierra games that actually used sound cards instead of just the beep, beep, beep, beep.

896
01:18:33,094 --> 01:18:33,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Good old AdLib.

897
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:35,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, AdLib.

898
01:18:35,315 --> 01:18:36,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an AdLib back in the day.

899
01:18:36,736 --> 01:18:37,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the bomb.

900
01:18:37,097 --> 01:18:46,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Because King's Quest, I want to say 1 through 3, or maybe 1 and 2, just used your internal speaker, the loud, harsh beeps, and 4 had sound card support.

901
01:18:47,303 --> 01:18:48,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So, amazing game.

902
01:18:51,086 --> 01:18:59,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, like most of the King's Quest games, it was possible to miss an item that you needed to not die or to kill the big bad at the end.

903
01:18:59,874 --> 01:19:07,682
[SPEAKER_09]: If you missed that puzzle, if you let Cupid fly away from the little pool without getting his Cupid's bow and arrow, and you saved your game, you were screwed.

904
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:08,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't beat it.

905
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:09,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, try again.

906
01:19:11,005 --> 01:19:12,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, great game.

907
01:19:13,307 --> 01:19:17,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it that so many people think so fondly of 4 specifically?

908
01:19:17,311 --> 01:19:19,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you ask most people, what's your favorite King's Quest game?

909
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:23,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people, including myself, would say 4 was the best, period.

910
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:26,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of a, what, 8-game series, right?

911
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people would say 4 is the best.

912
01:19:28,462 --> 01:19:30,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I rejected the reality in where it is real.

913
01:19:31,085 --> 01:19:31,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

914
01:19:31,325 --> 01:19:31,305
7.

915
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:31,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

916
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:34,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

917
01:19:34,327 --> 01:19:37,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Some might argue nine if you count this fan silver lining at this point.

918
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:45,012
[SPEAKER_07]: But why is it, regardless of how many you think there are or aren't, why is it that four is the one that's so fond and meet people's hearts?

919
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:49,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, I'm sure there's people listening to this show going, no, five was my favorite, or one was the best.

920
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:51,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Why four?

921
01:19:51,255 --> 01:19:52,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So many people that I know, at least.

922
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:58,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Visually, at the time, people just never saw a game that was that beautiful on PC gaming.

923
01:19:59,133 --> 01:20:05,997
[SPEAKER_09]: It really took EGA graphics as far as they literally could go without stepping up to VGA 256 colors.

924
01:20:06,837 --> 01:20:13,101
[SPEAKER_09]: So just visually, people just remember how awestruck they were when they saw it and they loaded up the game.

925
01:20:13,121 --> 01:20:15,482
[SPEAKER_09]: When you first arrive on that beach and you can see the wave...

926
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:19,005
[SPEAKER_09]: of the ocean up against the yellow sand.

927
01:20:19,866 --> 01:20:24,090
[SPEAKER_09]: The sound card support to actually have ad-lib music coming at you through your speakers.

928
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:31,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the nostalgia of text-based RPGs because it was the last one in that series.

929
01:20:31,177 --> 01:20:33,159
[SPEAKER_09]: King's Quest V and VI were all mouse-based.

930
01:20:33,464 --> 01:20:35,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for me, a big part of it too was in the story.

931
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:40,632
[SPEAKER_07]: It seemed like a lot of it was inspired by fables, Aesop's fables, like Hansel's and Gretel's type of thing.

932
01:20:40,952 --> 01:20:43,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that is very fond as well for me.

933
01:20:43,454 --> 01:20:44,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's why I grabbed it.

934
01:20:44,736 --> 01:20:49,000
[SPEAKER_09]: King's Quest has always had that a little bit, but yes, there were a lot of great...

935
01:20:50,061 --> 01:21:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: meta genre references particularly in 4 the three hags that represent the three fates that all share one eye and you had to catch their eyes so they were blind otherwise they were going to eat you that was in King's Quest 4 you find a gold ball and you throw it into a pond and you have to kiss the frog like the princess and the frog that's in King's Quest 4 so a lot of classic fairy tale homages are in this particular title

936
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:20,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I really wish this series would come back.

937
01:21:20,331 --> 01:21:23,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I understand there's the fan project, and I mean no disrespect.

938
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:29,859
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a wonderful, wonderful thing, and they've taken so much shit for what is really a thing that they love.

939
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,101
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm definitely not slamming that at all.

940
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:38,946
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really wish somebody would just give people lots of money to make a big-budget return of King's Quest.

941
01:21:39,006 --> 01:21:39,547
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

942
01:21:39,907 --> 01:21:40,828
[SPEAKER_07]: How awesome would that be?

943
01:21:40,848 --> 01:21:46,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there have been fanservice VGA or SVGA remakes of the first three.

944
01:21:47,353 --> 01:21:47,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.

945
01:21:47,914 --> 01:21:49,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That are completely independent and they run great.

946
01:21:49,995 --> 01:22:02,604
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, just like now with today's technology and games and so forth, with DVD and Blu-ray technology and stuff, I would just love to see a really well-done new King's Quest game that's just, you know, like, I don't know.

947
01:22:03,005 --> 01:22:04,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how to explain it.

948
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, just that whole kind of world.

949
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:06,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go back to that.

950
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:08,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

951
01:22:08,329 --> 01:22:08,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

952
01:22:27,222 --> 01:22:55,076
[SPEAKER_09]: completely different franchise and story and company but when that game because there was a point in them there was I think a sort of a a shift in what people wanted on PC gaming I think around maybe the early mid 90s where adventure games were boring people didn't like them anymore because Doom came in and PC became about first-person shooters and then Half-Life and all that and the Sierra style of games Space Quest, King's Quest were sort of left in the wake

953
01:22:55,916 --> 01:23:00,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You would think, though, with all the nostalgia wank that happens out there in the world, though, that there would be room for this.

954
01:23:00,818 --> 01:23:06,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And I realize that's kind of where Telltale kind of has their market right now, and they do a very good job at what they do.

955
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:13,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just surprised, especially when that whole silver lining stuff was going on, that who owns the license now?

956
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:17,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision, I guess, who got it from Vivendi, has basically said, you know what?

957
01:23:17,265 --> 01:23:18,605
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to revisit that world.

958
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:20,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not just King's Quest.

959
01:23:20,806 --> 01:23:21,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Space Quest.

960
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:23,467
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Hero Quest.

961
01:23:23,767 --> 01:23:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Quest for Glory.

962
01:23:24,768 --> 01:23:25,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Quest for Glory.

963
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:26,508
[SPEAKER_07]: all that stuff.

964
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:31,150
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's just I don't know, it's just kind of annoying because I would really like to see some of that come back.

965
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:36,051
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to sound a little elitist and maybe I'm a bit proud that this is elitist.

966
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:40,253
[SPEAKER_09]: These games probably too hard for kids these days.

967
01:23:40,633 --> 01:23:41,213
[SPEAKER_09]: They were hard.

968
01:23:41,853 --> 01:23:43,554
[SPEAKER_09]: You could save your game and just screw up.

969
01:23:43,654 --> 01:23:44,674
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to start all the way over.

970
01:23:45,594 --> 01:23:46,675
[SPEAKER_09]: That stuff doesn't fly now.

971
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:52,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And for it to be a true King's Quest or Space Quest game, it would need to be hard as hell and you would need to be able to

972
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:55,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you fail, sorry.

973
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:03,628
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't throw the boot at the cat, so now the mouse isn't going to rescue you in King's Quest V, so LOL, 15 hours of your life you have to do over.

974
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:06,031
[SPEAKER_09]: That won't fly anymore.

975
01:24:06,211 --> 01:24:06,571
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

976
01:24:09,154 --> 01:24:10,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody wants the easy button now.

977
01:24:11,436 --> 01:24:21,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, if you want to go see how we had it when we were young, you ungrateful kids, go check out King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella, because it was just one of the best King's Quest games they ever did.

978
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:25,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe this was ported to a variety of consoles.

979
01:24:25,105 --> 01:24:26,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just PC.

980
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:32,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, clearly the PC is the best one, but if you must, I believe it was on the NES, wasn't it?

981
01:24:33,243 --> 01:24:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Five was.

982
01:24:34,144 --> 01:24:34,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Five was ported.

983
01:24:34,764 --> 01:24:36,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought four was on the NES, too.

984
01:24:36,185 --> 01:24:37,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, five was the one.

985
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:42,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you can get the King's Quest Collection and Space Quest Collection on Steam.

986
01:24:42,929 --> 01:24:50,834
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes with a DOS box, which is that sort of indie MS-DOS emulator that's fully inclusive of all that stuff that will run on Windows 7.

987
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:57,178
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes, of course, this game, King's Quest 4, for about $20 on Steam.

988
01:24:57,338 --> 01:24:57,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

989
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,940
[SPEAKER_09]: For whatever reason, it's never on sale.

990
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:11,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the licensing for it is very bare bones where Activision is like, here's this DOS box emulated comp of these old ass games and we're not letting you put it on sale ever.

991
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:16,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam never really features it on the RPG page.

992
01:25:16,931 --> 01:25:20,253
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to literally search for it in the Steam client, King's Quest Collection.

993
01:25:20,534 --> 01:25:20,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Good tip.

994
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:21,514
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can get it.

995
01:25:21,714 --> 01:25:22,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

996
01:25:22,515 --> 01:25:26,077
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody's still using GameTap, I think a lot of those games are on there too.

997
01:25:26,217 --> 01:25:27,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Good old games.

998
01:25:27,478 --> 01:25:28,859
[SPEAKER_09]: GOG might have some of these too.

999
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:29,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1000
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:29,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1001
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says Westwood also put out the Kyrandia series of adventure games.

1002
01:25:34,623 --> 01:25:37,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Just reminded me of another great series that was out there.

1003
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:39,167
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one Loki really liked too, if I remember right, right?

1004
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:43,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did like specifically Kyrandia, the Hands of Fate.

1005
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:49,405
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, that's going to do it for our classic game of the week.

1006
01:25:49,725 --> 01:25:50,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good pick, Alan.

1007
01:25:50,686 --> 01:25:51,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Very well done.

1008
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:53,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure DarkSakura would be proud.

1009
01:25:53,727 --> 01:25:54,708
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll ask her when she gets back.

1010
01:25:55,168 --> 01:25:58,530
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are going to take a quick break, but don't worry, there's plenty more OLR to come.

1011
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:00,350
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get to some rapid-fire news.

1012
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:01,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter topics, of course.

1015
01:26:11,316 --> 01:26:14,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But not just that, because we'll talk about that Dreamcast collection.

[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, she is out right now.

1020
01:26:42,351 --> 01:26:43,191
[SPEAKER_07]: She's on her way back.

1021
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:45,572
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been at some type of pinball event all day.

1022
01:26:45,612 --> 01:26:49,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping she makes it back before the end of the show so we can ask her about that a little bit.

1023
01:26:49,473 --> 01:26:53,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But joining us here in studio tonight, filling in is Salacious Pop, who's been on a few episodes of OLR.

[SPEAKER_07]: The tapes every Thursday There might be a live episode this week We are working on that I'm going to try and hammer out the details I don't know exactly how that's going to work Because I've got to make sure if it's going to be at all games We have to respect that there are other shows that already have time slots So we're going to try to make that happen this week One off thing, we're not always live though And if you like that, Extifer is my co-host there And he's pretty hilarious And we talk a lot about World of Warcraft and all that good stuff

[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

1034
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to some quick news.

1035
01:28:24,826 --> 01:28:26,907
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to Twitter topics in just a minute.

1036
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:31,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Last call for some Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash OLR while we do some rapid fire news.

1037
01:28:33,185 --> 01:28:51,031
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of that whole Mega Man Legends 3 meta thing that they have going on where basically the fans get to decide different aspects of Mega Man, well it came down to voice actresses or actors for the Mega Man role.

1038
01:28:51,771 --> 01:29:17,928
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was up to the vote of fans and 3,000 people voted and it looks like that your Mega Man voice actress is going to be Akimi Kondra and I guess she was the voice actress that did work in Mega Man X Command Mission, Mega Man Powered Up and I guess she's also done work in Persona 4, Fatal Frame 2 and Clannad and

1039
01:29:19,269 --> 01:29:19,850
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

1040
01:29:21,191 --> 01:29:23,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Mega Man Legends 3 is heading to the 3DS.

1041
01:29:24,374 --> 01:29:26,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Another reason to own a 3DS.

1042
01:29:27,457 --> 01:29:28,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking Mega Man Legends.

1043
01:29:28,878 --> 01:29:29,599
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

1044
01:29:32,594 --> 01:29:41,018
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dreamcast Collection, something that's been rumored for a while, is actually coming out on PC and Xbox 360 this February.

1045
01:29:42,058 --> 01:29:44,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta admit, though, it's not too exciting.

1046
01:29:44,199 --> 01:29:57,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really just a collection of the titles that are coming on Xbox Live Arcade, including Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure, Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5 Part 2, all with slightly enhanced up-res graphics.

1047
01:30:00,323 --> 01:30:01,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, apparently it's going to retail for $30.

1048
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:05,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be out on February 22nd.

1049
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:08,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1050
01:30:08,471 --> 01:30:12,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that you'd be interested in, Rob, since, you know, it does have Space Channel 5?

1051
01:30:13,096 --> 01:30:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1052
01:30:13,676 --> 01:30:14,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I hella want Space Channel 5.

1053
01:30:14,938 --> 01:30:17,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the thing, though, is I wouldn't buy the collection.

1054
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just buy Space Channel 5 when it comes out, you know, on Xbox Live Arcade.

1055
01:30:21,345 --> 01:30:22,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what made my ears perk up.

1056
01:30:22,946 --> 01:30:23,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what?

1057
01:30:24,006 --> 01:30:24,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh la la, what?

1058
01:30:25,527 --> 01:30:28,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Sonic Adventure, I heard that port wasn't very good.

1059
01:30:28,368 --> 01:30:30,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Taxis, missing a lot of the license stuff in there.

1060
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:31,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Adventure just wasn't very good.

1061
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,651
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you can port it all you want.

1062
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:37,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sega Bass Fishing, I just don't give a shit about that.

1063
01:30:37,253 --> 01:30:40,254
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know.

1064
01:30:41,555 --> 01:30:43,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a juicy rumor here.

1065
01:30:43,095 --> 01:30:45,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, you know, the...

1066
01:30:47,574 --> 01:30:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, I'm jumping ahead here.

1067
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:49,955
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a little bit.

1068
01:30:50,015 --> 01:30:50,436
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

1069
01:30:50,476 --> 01:30:52,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, must have missed the link there.

1070
01:30:52,977 --> 01:30:54,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is actually a juicy rumor.

1071
01:30:54,638 --> 01:30:56,880
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually coming in the form of Slurpees.

1072
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:11,048
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be doing some sort of promotion now with LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3, where you can go buy Slurpees at your local 7-Eleven, and you'll be able to get different, I guess...

1073
01:31:12,589 --> 01:31:16,811
[SPEAKER_06]: prizes or codes that you can redeem for things.

1074
01:31:17,191 --> 01:31:21,694
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have strategy guides, premium themes, download content, and more.

1075
01:31:23,415 --> 01:31:27,317
[SPEAKER_06]: No word if they're going to actually have any sort of special flavors to go along with them.

1076
01:31:28,397 --> 01:31:32,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost wanted to stop at 7-11 on the way here because it's like, ooh, Slurpee.

1077
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:34,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good stuff.

1078
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:41,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Slurpees are amazing, but lots of calories.

1079
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:47,346
[SPEAKER_07]: So for those of you that are trying to do diets for the new year, I'd stay away from Slurpees, just saying.

1080
01:31:48,406 --> 01:31:49,307
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're really good.

1081
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:50,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the pina colada ones.

1082
01:31:50,945 --> 01:31:52,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was just about to bring that up.

1083
01:31:53,127 --> 01:31:53,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So gross.

1084
01:31:54,649 --> 01:31:56,891
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll get the large slurpee of the flavor.

1085
01:31:57,271 --> 01:31:58,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I think coconut is vile.

1086
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:02,916
[SPEAKER_09]: So he will get the pina colada to guarantee that I won't try to, you know, Bogart it from him.

1087
01:32:03,016 --> 01:32:03,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I love coconut.

1088
01:32:03,737 --> 01:32:06,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I love my croons are like my favorite cookie ever.

1089
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And then coconut cream pie is so amazing.

1090
01:32:09,102 --> 01:32:09,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

1091
01:32:11,384 --> 01:32:13,026
[SPEAKER_07]: What have I been eating the last two weeks?

1092
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,122
[SPEAKER_06]: French onion soup How dare I How dare I

1093
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:04,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is, but A&W from an A&W or even the combination KFC A&W like they have out here is so much better than the ones at the store.

1094
01:33:04,944 --> 01:33:05,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't explain it.

1095
01:33:05,725 --> 01:33:07,406
[SPEAKER_07]: A&W from the tap is so much better.

1096
01:33:07,946 --> 01:33:09,527
[SPEAKER_06]: They sell them in gallon jugs.

1097
01:33:10,107 --> 01:33:11,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God.

1098
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:13,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Today I was like, I could drink a half gallon.

1099
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:14,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I could do it.

1100
01:33:16,152 --> 01:33:16,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen them!

1101
01:33:17,372 --> 01:33:22,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are seriously... It's a sight to behold, I tell ya, man.

1102
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:25,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I took Salacious Pop to Panera for the first time today, though.

1103
01:33:25,855 --> 01:33:26,555
[SPEAKER_07]: He really liked it.

1104
01:33:26,915 --> 01:33:28,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they don't have them in his neck of the woods.

1105
01:33:28,995 --> 01:33:29,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a new thing.

1106
01:33:29,956 --> 01:33:35,257
[SPEAKER_09]: People on Facebook have said that there's a bunch around me, but in the neighborhood I'm in, there aren't any.

1107
01:33:35,837 --> 01:33:40,418
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I've never seen one, so... What's ironic is it took... It was hella good.

1108
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:41,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It took the place of a Krispy Kreme.

1109
01:33:41,959 --> 01:33:42,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1110
01:33:42,879 --> 01:33:45,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, and that is crime right there.

1111
01:33:45,883 --> 01:33:49,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, they should have just, I don't know, they should have tore down another restaurant.

1112
01:33:49,788 --> 01:33:51,110
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, get rid of the Wendy's.

1113
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:53,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Wendy's sucks in everything.

1114
01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:56,357
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get back to gaming news.

1115
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:57,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet again, the food topic.

1116
01:33:57,839 --> 01:33:59,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what to say.

1117
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a release date for PlayStation Move Heroes.

1118
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's March 22nd.

1119
01:34:04,045 --> 01:34:07,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Some bonuses that come with the reservations depending on where you reserve it.

1120
01:34:08,408 --> 01:34:16,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazon and GameStop, you can get a skin pack with Pirate Sly, Freedom League Jack, and Trillium Armor Ratchet is all the special stuff you can get there.

1121
01:34:17,635 --> 01:34:22,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, quote, there's also a full story surrounding the game and why they're all together.

1122
01:34:22,599 --> 01:34:26,262
[SPEAKER_07]: That is from Christian Cardona, the marketing manager of the game.

1123
01:34:26,602 --> 01:34:28,063
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation Move Heroes.

1124
01:34:29,284 --> 01:34:31,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I have yet to buy a PlayStation Move, I don't know.

1125
01:34:31,847 --> 01:34:34,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Street Fighter 4 3D is coming out, of course, on the 3DS.

1126
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:36,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have online multiplayer.

1127
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:37,834
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty neat.

1128
01:34:38,054 --> 01:34:41,678
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a whole little trailer, too, that hit the internet this week that was showing some of the features like that.

1129
01:34:42,018 --> 01:34:46,003
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's also going to be worldwide online play and what's called Channel Live.

1130
01:34:46,743 --> 01:34:50,568
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just watch live matches in Channel Live if you want to watch the pros do their thing.

1131
01:34:50,968 --> 01:34:55,192
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also figurine collecting and random street fighting modes if you want to do that.

1132
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:58,555
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that whole using the aware thing as you walk by people.

1133
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess your character can fight somebody else even though you're not actually fighting.

1134
01:35:03,219 --> 01:35:07,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So this sounds like it's going to be a pretty big launch title even though most of us have already played Super Street Fighter 4.

1135
01:35:07,963 --> 01:35:11,246
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is, and maybe this has already been answered somewhere, I just haven't seen it.

1136
01:35:11,827 --> 01:35:14,730
[SPEAKER_07]: How has the character roster been affected by the move to the 3DS?

1137
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:16,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, surely they had to cut some characters out, right?

1138
01:35:16,871 --> 01:35:17,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1139
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:33,822
[SPEAKER_09]: or did they not wow the videos and the YouTubes that have been out of this game have blown my mind on how good it looks so for it to look that good if they cut a few characters in order for that to happen I do not mind because that is some awesome stuff coming out on that game right now

1140
01:35:34,932 --> 01:35:35,432
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1141
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:01,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I go on the tangent train a little bit?

1142
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:02,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1143
01:36:03,451 --> 01:36:16,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope that this generation of handhelds, be it the 3DS or the PSP2, uses more of the infrastructure, central server style of multiplayer.

1144
01:36:16,566 --> 01:36:18,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the last few...

1145
01:36:19,349 --> 01:36:44,664
[SPEAKER_09]: generations obviously you've got the Game Boy Advance with the link up cable that was the last generation that used that with the PSP and the DS it's all ad hoc I don't know that many people that have a DS or PSP where I can be in the same room with them and do ad hoc connect so I really want this generation Super Street Fighter 4 3DS to have the central server and I know with the PS3 and the PSP you can do the tethering but that's still just too cumbersome for me so I'm hoping that

1146
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:46,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too much of a pain in the ass, I agree.

1147
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:51,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So I love handhelds, but I'll never play ad hoc support because I don't know that many friends with them.

1148
01:36:51,964 --> 01:36:52,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all.

1149
01:36:53,024 --> 01:36:53,605
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

1150
01:36:54,005 --> 01:36:57,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about another fighting game on the 3DS, Dead or Alive Dimensions.

1151
01:36:57,707 --> 01:37:02,611
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of interesting because they've talked about this game's going to have 30 frames a second and 60 frames a second.

1152
01:37:03,011 --> 01:37:06,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It just depends on if you're playing 3D or 2D.

1153
01:37:07,014 --> 01:37:10,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're playing in 3D mode, you only get 30 frames a second per eye.

1154
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:14,379
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you decide to condense it down to 2D, you'll get a 60 frames a second fighter.

1155
01:37:14,659 --> 01:37:15,460
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of interesting.

1156
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:22,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it makes sense too because obviously 3D is rendering one frame and then another really fast back and forth in rapid succession.

1157
01:37:23,348 --> 01:37:29,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'll still look pretty good in 3D, but that's pretty cool that if you get sick of 3D, there's kind of like a little perk, if you will, to play in 2D.

1158
01:37:29,934 --> 01:37:30,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of neat.

1159
01:37:30,495 --> 01:37:31,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the same thing with...

1160
01:37:32,897 --> 01:37:34,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure a lot of games are like that, by the way.

1161
01:37:34,338 --> 01:37:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, same with Street Fighter 4 on there, because they have that really funky view that you can do that gives it more depth, but if you don't want to do that, you don't have to do that, which is great.

1162
01:37:42,945 --> 01:37:43,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1163
01:37:44,507 --> 01:37:47,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Salacious Pop has a few stories for us, then we're going to get to the Twitter topics.

1164
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:55,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick, though, I was just going to say, now, I've noticed, and I think this is kind of smart in Nintendo's part, at least, I don't know if it's Nintendo's part, but

1165
01:37:56,336 --> 01:38:00,919
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as the games that are coming out launched for it and stuff.

1166
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be quite a variety.

1167
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:08,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not all like, oh, it's Mario this or Zelda this and all kiddie stuff.

1168
01:38:08,724 --> 01:38:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like we've got some hardcore fighters in there.

1169
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:18,529
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a little bit of the Nintendogs kind of crap and a little bit of something for everybody.

1170
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:21,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's pretty awesome.

1171
01:38:24,295 --> 01:38:24,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

1172
01:38:25,236 --> 01:38:30,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like it's going to have a pretty good lineup at the beginning, so I just hope the price is reasonable.

1173
01:38:30,223 --> 01:38:31,544
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see pretty soon, though.

1174
01:38:33,387 --> 01:38:34,348
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, SalaciousPop.

1175
01:38:35,862 --> 01:38:50,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, for my quickfire stories, those of you who wanted to play Pac-Man Battle Royale, the return to form Pac-Man arcade game multiplayer, that is now available to American arcade distributors.

1176
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:56,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means that whatever arcade, if you're fortunate enough to live in an area that still has one, they can have it.

1177
01:38:57,033 --> 01:39:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cocktail style cabinet, you know, the old pizza parlor model, set your drink on it.

1178
01:39:04,376 --> 01:39:05,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the flat glass cabinet.

1179
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:07,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming soon to Dave & Buster's everywhere, I'm sure.

1180
01:39:07,938 --> 01:39:09,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1181
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:31,934
[SPEAKER_09]: According to the source of the article, Arcade Heroes, it's currently being sold for $4,275 to the arcade businesses that might want to get it and put it in the store or in their arcade, which apparently is cheaper than most of the other stuff because most arcade games right now that are popular are the ticket spitters.

1182
01:39:32,974 --> 01:39:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: and the big, you know, the time crisis, the huge shoot-em-up arcade games.

1183
01:39:37,818 --> 01:39:46,604
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, the Pac-Man Battle Royale Cocktail Cabinet, a little over four grand, I guess, is a steal for a new arcade machine.

1184
01:39:47,104 --> 01:39:53,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, Pac-Man fans, look for that in your arcade, starting hopefully as soon as this month, because it's out there for us to buy it.

1185
01:39:54,189 --> 01:39:55,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So, next...

1186
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:05,638
[SPEAKER_09]: The domain name FinalFantasy13-2Game.com has been registered by Squeenix.

1187
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:09,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone's all, you know, freaking out about what this means.

1188
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:14,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Lightning is going to become a pop singer, just like, what's her name in Final Fantasy?

1189
01:40:14,764 --> 01:40:16,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, AddressSphere, I can't wait.

1190
01:40:16,105 --> 01:40:16,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1191
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:24,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that was registered along with a bunch of other domains for their, I'm going to totally butcher this pronunciation,

1192
01:40:25,372 --> 01:40:27,734
[SPEAKER_09]: N.I.E.R., Nier, that RPG they put out.

1193
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:28,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Nier or whatever.

1194
01:40:28,715 --> 01:40:29,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Nier and Mindjack.

1195
01:40:30,617 --> 01:40:33,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So a bunch of domains are registered for those properties.

1196
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:41,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Square is holding a first production party premiere event in Japan in two days on the 18th.

1197
01:40:41,866 --> 01:40:47,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So people are like, ooh, what titles and little side story projects are they going to announce today?

1198
01:40:47,811 --> 01:40:49,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll find out about Kingdom Hearts 3

1199
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:40,542
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe maybe we'll find out that would be a great E3 announcement though Final Fantasy 7 remake maybe I'm just flame baiting at this point maybe we'll find out about Final Fantasy 14 redo over the do over expansion they said they were doing Final Fantasy 6 on the DS the 3DS then I would I would that'd be enough for me

1200
01:41:41,403 --> 01:41:45,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Square is having some event in two days and they registered 13-2 game.

1201
01:41:45,327 --> 01:41:50,192
[SPEAKER_09]: FinalFantasy13.com Speculate to your heart's content.

1202
01:41:52,194 --> 01:42:01,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Last quick fire story for me is that some of the retail marketing assets for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 have Akuma.

1203
01:42:02,384 --> 01:42:02,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Akuma, Akuma, Akuma

1204
01:42:21,607 --> 01:42:23,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez, do we have the full roster yet?

1205
01:42:23,348 --> 01:42:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seems like every week there's some damn story about, oh, this character's in it.

1206
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:27,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this character's in it.

1207
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:34,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in this little sample graphic here, it's got Akuma, Tron Bon, which we already knew about, Albert Wesker.

1208
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:36,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I knew about him.

1209
01:42:37,495 --> 01:42:38,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he was announced a while ago.

1210
01:42:38,956 --> 01:42:40,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Arthur, of course, from Ghosts and Goblins.

1211
01:42:41,217 --> 01:42:43,478
[SPEAKER_09]: He was announced a while ago.

1212
01:42:43,498 --> 01:42:43,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

1213
01:42:43,738 --> 01:42:47,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we know that Akuma is at least in print material for the game.

1214
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So, he's got to be... Maybe he's unlockable, but he's in there.

1215
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:51,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1216
01:42:51,602 --> 01:42:52,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll see.

1217
01:42:53,502 --> 01:42:55,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, for now, let's go to the Twitter.

1218
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:57,263
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get some tweets.

1219
01:42:58,143 --> 01:43:02,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week we ask you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1220
01:43:02,444 --> 01:43:05,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to read some messages sent to us right now.

1221
01:43:05,905 --> 01:43:08,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start off with Spassinator PSN sent us a couple tweets here.

1222
01:43:08,986 --> 01:43:13,227
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a ton of free stuff put onto the PSN video store lately.

1223
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:16,247
[SPEAKER_07]: The usual spot, so be sure to check it out.

1224
01:43:16,847 --> 01:43:18,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you like free videos, you can check that out.

1225
01:43:19,548 --> 01:43:48,672
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully your console doesn't get forked if you try to hack it and then you'll lose that rights to all that video content so be careful Redertainment I like this tweet which console would compete better on Jeopardy the 360 the PS3 or the Wii because you know if you haven't heard there's that whole computer that's going on Jeopardy that's supposed to be doing battle against what like Ken Jennings and I don't know somebody else whatever so I don't know what do you guys think which console would compete best on Jeopardy

1226
01:43:50,249 --> 01:43:56,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I would guess the PlayStation 3 because of, you know, that whole Uber chip that's inside it.

1227
01:43:56,332 --> 01:44:00,533
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of got the best computer parts, if you will.

1228
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:04,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the 360 would call Alex Trebek a fag and then the panel boat would go red.

1229
01:44:05,816 --> 01:44:06,576
[SPEAKER_09]: The right on screen.

1230
01:44:06,956 --> 01:44:10,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It would go red and then it would just sit there for the rest of the show.

1231
01:44:11,018 --> 01:44:13,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And Alex Trebek would be like... So, yeah.

1232
01:44:15,347 --> 01:44:19,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft sends us a link to a story about a video game pirate trades sales for Steam.

1233
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:22,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a link to a story on Kotaku.

1234
01:44:31,776 --> 01:44:32,097
[SPEAKER_07]: and so forth.

1235
01:44:32,117 --> 01:44:32,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

1236
01:44:47,917 --> 01:44:52,021
[SPEAKER_07]: He said near the end of 2010 he had stopped playing PC games altogether.

1237
01:44:52,421 --> 01:44:55,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he ended up liking a game, he wouldn't even bother to order it.

1238
01:44:55,084 --> 01:44:57,466
[SPEAKER_07]: He'd just keep playing it until he beat it and then move on.

1239
01:44:58,487 --> 01:45:00,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Steam, I guess, changed his mind.

1240
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:02,271
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been a user on Steam for five years.

1241
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:08,377
[SPEAKER_07]: and then he would I guess wake up during the holiday sale and see what games he's going to buy.

1242
01:45:09,057 --> 01:45:12,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Having the convenience of Steam to download games right there was enough for him.

1243
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:15,123
[SPEAKER_07]: He bought 22 games over the course of the sale.

1244
01:45:15,964 --> 01:45:16,425
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1245
01:45:16,805 --> 01:45:21,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the 3DS too is something else that's making him reform.

1246
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:22,891
[SPEAKER_07]: You can read the whole piece there on Kotaku.

1247
01:45:24,132 --> 01:45:31,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Another link sent to us on Twitter from SJ100 Matt says this is a link about a group of fans remaking Sonic 2 in HD.

1248
01:45:32,358 --> 01:45:43,787
[SPEAKER_07]: This is yet another one of those things where I remember one of these not that long ago there was a story about a Sonic game that was being like remade or like a whole new HD Sonic game that looked better than Sonic 4.

1249
01:45:44,227 --> 01:45:48,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Jamie had the story and she was reporting on it and it looked better than what Sega's putting out.

1250
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:54,755
[SPEAKER_07]: and now there's this whole little teaser on YouTube I guess for a remade Sonic 2 in HD.

1251
01:45:55,155 --> 01:45:59,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it just looks like old school Sonic but in widescreen and high def.

1252
01:45:59,879 --> 01:46:00,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks great.

1253
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck isn't this on Xbox Live?

1254
01:46:07,342 --> 01:46:07,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.

1255
01:46:09,025 --> 01:46:11,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how all the fans try to one-up Sega, though.

1256
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:15,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, at what point does flattery become insult?

1257
01:46:16,695 --> 01:46:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, seriously, I don't even know.

1258
01:46:18,737 --> 01:46:20,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Defective Candy sends us a tweet.

1259
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:24,145
[SPEAKER_07]: The first kinetic app has shown up in the Mac App Store.

1260
01:46:24,565 --> 01:46:34,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Connect 3D Viewer app, and you can plug the USB Connect into your Mac, and you get a 3D visualization of the depth data.

1261
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:38,174
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also map RGB values on the image.

1262
01:46:38,494 --> 01:46:40,676
[SPEAKER_07]: You can zoom and rotate the visualization.

1263
01:46:41,036 --> 01:46:45,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So it kind of looks like an old-school Max Headroom thing from the 80s in this little clip you see there.

1264
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:50,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, now that the Mac App Store is open, people are putting all sorts of creative things up on there.

1265
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:50,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.

1266
01:46:51,423 --> 01:46:52,304
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1267
01:47:11,802 --> 01:47:13,044
[SPEAKER_07]: PS3 Unlocker

1268
01:47:29,845 --> 01:47:49,134
[SPEAKER_07]: so uh wow that that sucks actually for Sony if that happens because there's just gonna be so many people that abuse that and well it's too bad they could easily ban those people that do that they do that for Xbox live right now because you can do that already with JTAG consoles but I mean

1269
01:47:50,614 --> 01:47:51,295
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell.

1270
01:47:52,416 --> 01:47:52,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually you can tell.

1271
01:47:53,256 --> 01:47:56,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, he has a 2 million gamer score.

1272
01:47:56,979 --> 01:47:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a little weird.

1273
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:00,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a little high.

1274
01:48:01,161 --> 01:48:06,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoy metagaming and the whole sort of semi-EP achievement point thing.

1275
01:48:06,685 --> 01:48:08,206
[SPEAKER_09]: WoW has it, Xbox has it.

1276
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:18,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's neat, but I just can't imagine who is taking this seriously enough to where they want to hack themselves up into the 50,000 score so they can go, hey, look at my gamer card, look at my score.

1277
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:20,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is that person?

1278
01:48:20,214 --> 01:48:22,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to meet them and maybe push them down some stairs.

1279
01:48:24,095 --> 01:48:26,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, big fucking deal.

1280
01:48:26,516 --> 01:48:29,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, woo, you unlocked everything and you did it by cheating.

1281
01:48:29,858 --> 01:48:31,459
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's unfortunate.

1282
01:48:31,859 --> 01:48:33,660
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, someone who does it legitimately...

1283
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:44,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some really cool achievements, but you know, the person who unlocks the most, the maximum achievements in one game isn't good at every single game, and that's okay.

1284
01:48:44,667 --> 01:48:51,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like in the Olympics, the same competitors don't do every single sport, unless you're looking at something like the decathlon, but that's different.

1285
01:48:51,832 --> 01:49:18,373
[SPEAKER_09]: and XBLA will occasionally feature a gamer on Xbox Live that has a really high number sometimes it'll be you know an Iraqi vet that's now disabled and they play Xbox and now they have like a 30,000 XBLA score and that's interesting to find out about the people that have numbers that high because they just they play that much and a hack like this kind of takes away from the few people that you know yeah have made a name for themselves out of metagaming so yeah

1286
01:49:18,593 --> 01:49:20,893
[SPEAKER_07]: So stop being a dick, basically, folks.

1287
01:49:21,033 --> 01:49:24,794
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a dick thing to do, is to unlock all the trophies that you didn't earn.

1288
01:49:25,294 --> 01:49:25,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Dick.

1289
01:49:26,275 --> 01:49:28,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on to another tweet.

1290
01:49:28,255 --> 01:49:30,095
[SPEAKER_07]: The last tweet tonight, also from Tigerclaw.

1291
01:49:30,655 --> 01:49:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: A Bulletstorm demo, I guess, is going on there.

1292
01:49:33,776 --> 01:49:36,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Epic Games has an upcoming first-person shooter called Bulletstorm.

1293
01:49:37,857 --> 01:49:43,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network demo is coming out on January 25th, if you want to check this out and see if this is the game for you.

1294
01:49:44,638 --> 01:49:48,119
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura on Twitter tweets us saying, Why are you so hot?

1295
01:50:15,063 --> 01:50:15,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Music

1296
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:45,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think you're doing a fabulous job, SalaciousPop, so you would make DarkSakura very proud.

1297
01:50:46,478 --> 01:50:52,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to do this last story before... All right, well, let's hurry up and get there, because we're through Twitter topics, so we got a couple more stories here.

1298
01:50:53,287 --> 01:50:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to Loki.

1299
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:53,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1300
01:50:56,469 --> 01:51:04,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we were talking a little bit about the 3DS and stuff and of course not all the news is great.

1301
01:51:06,494 --> 01:51:17,200
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be first off region locking the console which is not a huge surprise because the DSi, at least the DSiWare part was actually region locked.

1302
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:46,341
[SPEAKER_06]: um, but now they've kind of gone against what they've been doing with the NDS and stuff, and they're just locking the console which, as I said before in our first story, um you're just giving the hackers another excuse to try to, you know crack your system, cause now instead of like, oh I want to install Linux on it, now they're like, well I want to play games for other regions, so I'm gonna hack this and this is gonna be my justification for doing that, so I don't know, it sucks um

1303
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:56,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, it looks like, for example, if you play a Korean 3DS game with a Japanese 3DS system, or vice versa, you won't be able to play it at all.

1304
01:51:57,021 --> 01:51:59,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo hasn't actually responded to the comment about it.

1305
01:52:03,809 --> 01:52:27,004
[SPEAKER_06]: but they haven't really said it says there's no region codes in DS and DS Lite but the DSi, DSi XL, and 3DS have region codes region codes are installed to each game and the 3DS itself you can't play if the region codes are different so that's kind of lame um region locking sucks I hate it

1306
01:52:29,497 --> 01:52:35,927
[SPEAKER_07]: it's what drove me to piracy on the PS1 was wanting to play import Japanese games and I couldn't do it just being honest

1307
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:43,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then of course they're talking about being a little bit more consistent with their first party releases for the 3DS.

1308
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:53,962
[SPEAKER_06]: They were saying that with the Nintendo DS right now, they're not having, I don't know, I think they're doing pretty good with the titles that they have coming out.

1309
01:52:53,982 --> 01:53:01,505
[SPEAKER_06]: They have about one or two titles a month from, actually Nintendo, or maybe it's like one or two titles every few months.

1310
01:53:02,385 --> 01:53:18,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, cause I know, let's see, uh, Dragon Quest is being published by Nintendo, and then Pokemon Black and White, and then they've got, um, I guess they didn't have a first party Wii title for January, but they do have Mario Sports Mix for February.

1311
01:53:19,981 --> 01:53:20,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1312
01:53:20,201 --> 01:53:20,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1313
01:53:20,871 --> 01:53:26,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're saying that they're going to be working to have a more consistent release schedule for games.

1314
01:53:28,198 --> 01:53:29,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe something like once a month.

1315
01:53:30,501 --> 01:53:33,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of cool.

1316
01:53:33,103 --> 01:53:42,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're also targeting other regions as well, developing countries in addition to its current territories to bring the new console to.

1317
01:53:42,673 --> 01:53:43,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's...

1318
01:53:45,481 --> 01:53:48,407
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good for people that haven't had a lot of console games.

1319
01:53:48,467 --> 01:53:52,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Brazil or South America.

1320
01:53:52,795 --> 01:53:56,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some places down there that could use some new consoles.

1321
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:19,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited to hear that they might have more of a kind of constant stream of games because yeah it seemed like with the DS it was like especially right after launch like I seem to remember a lot of games didn't come out almost for like a year for the DS after the launch yeah but here's my thing though is you know are we gonna actually get new games or is this gonna be like

1322
01:54:19,855 --> 01:54:20,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and we're porting this.

1323
01:54:21,456 --> 01:54:22,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, we're porting this.

1324
01:54:44,091 --> 01:54:46,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And I gotta admit, okay, how sad is this, you guys?

1325
01:54:47,393 --> 01:54:48,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to admit this.

1326
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:51,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I kinda want the Nintendogs plus cats.

1327
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:52,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know why.

1328
01:54:52,757 --> 01:54:52,857
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1329
01:54:53,197 --> 01:54:53,838
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do know why.

1330
01:54:53,898 --> 01:54:54,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the cats.

1331
01:54:54,738 --> 01:54:56,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna buy all three versions like Loki does.

1332
01:54:56,799 --> 01:54:57,120
[SPEAKER_07]: No way.

1333
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:01,723
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not doing that either, because I learned my lesson the hard way.

1334
01:55:01,743 --> 01:55:03,204
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not even gonna buy one version this time.

1335
01:55:03,304 --> 01:55:04,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying one.

1336
01:55:05,325 --> 01:55:08,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this would make a lot of people even more excited about the 3DS.

1337
01:55:08,646 --> 01:55:11,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I really wish they would do this, and I don't know why.

1338
01:55:12,147 --> 01:55:12,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me explain.

1339
01:55:13,067 --> 01:55:13,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

1340
01:55:13,528 --> 01:55:18,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo did an interview with Satoru Iwata called the Iwata Asks interview.

1341
01:55:18,909 --> 01:55:22,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Iwata-san also wants to include 3D video in the future.

1342
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:24,011
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Miyamoto had said.

1343
01:55:24,771 --> 01:55:30,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Iwata said, quote, I think it would be fun if we were able to include video recording capabilities with future updates.

1344
01:55:30,533 --> 01:55:33,454
[SPEAKER_07]: That means it's not going to be there on release, but perhaps in the future.

1345
01:55:34,214 --> 01:55:34,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1346
01:55:35,514 --> 01:55:35,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1347
01:55:36,295 --> 01:55:36,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1348
01:55:36,935 --> 01:55:37,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.

1349
01:55:37,695 --> 01:55:42,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I realize that 3D videos, you can't watch them a whole lot of places except maybe, oh, your 3DS.

1350
01:55:43,098 --> 01:55:44,278
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

1351
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be kind of cool, like in a way, being able to make your own 3D videos.

1352
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:50,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, give it five seconds and there will be a porno.

1353
01:55:51,002 --> 01:55:53,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it five seconds and there will be a porno on the 3DS.

1354
01:55:54,023 --> 01:55:57,285
[SPEAKER_07]: But can you imagine if you could do like video sharing through 3DS?

1355
01:55:57,745 --> 01:55:59,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if Nintendo was smart...

1356
01:56:01,448 --> 01:56:21,703
[SPEAKER_07]: They would introduce this whole social network file sharing ability Like a portal where you could share videos with your friends That you make on the 3DS Like my trip to Disneyland They could have a 3D YouTube They could have it if they wanted it Do you realize how big that is?

1357
01:56:21,803 --> 01:56:27,988
[SPEAKER_07]: With 3D being all the rage and stuff right now But they don't want it But they won't Because they are so bullheaded

1358
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:33,251
[SPEAKER_07]: If Nintendo was smart, they would make 3D YouTube before YouTube can, but they won't.

1359
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:35,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think YouTube already has 3D YouTube.

1360
01:56:37,373 --> 01:56:42,775
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, the difference is, most computers yet aren't set up to do 3D.

1361
01:56:42,835 --> 01:56:46,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS, it's a camera and it's the viewer all in one.

1362
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:52,679
[SPEAKER_07]: It's... But no, they won't do it.

1363
01:56:53,299 --> 01:56:54,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm mad.

1364
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Nintendo just...

1365
01:56:57,403 --> 01:56:58,304
[SPEAKER_07]: They're hard-headed.

1366
01:56:58,344 --> 01:56:59,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what my dad would say.

1367
01:56:59,664 --> 01:57:00,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard-headed.

1368
01:57:00,645 --> 01:57:01,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo's hard-headed.

1369
01:57:02,626 --> 01:57:07,349
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, there was also talk about the whole StreetPass feature as used in Nintendogs plus Cats.

1370
01:57:07,790 --> 01:57:08,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That was from Hideki Kono.

1371
01:57:09,391 --> 01:57:09,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote,

1372
01:57:19,477 --> 01:57:24,300
[SPEAKER_07]: That's supposed to be like when people actually meet in, you know, the park, walking their dogs and what have you.

1373
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:27,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I've never given another dog walker a gift.

1374
01:57:27,222 --> 01:57:27,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about you.

1375
01:57:28,523 --> 01:57:30,305
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, that's supposed to be a feature.

1376
01:57:30,365 --> 01:57:30,785
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

1377
01:57:30,805 --> 01:57:34,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear about this shit and I go, isn't that what the DS was supposed to do?

1378
01:57:34,768 --> 01:57:37,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, wasn't your DS supposed to have that always aware thing?

1379
01:57:37,269 --> 01:57:40,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what's so special about what the 3DS is doing?

1380
01:57:40,271 --> 01:57:43,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have to hold the 3DSs in a certain way so they can sniff each other's butts?

1381
01:57:44,794 --> 01:57:45,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a feature?

1382
01:57:45,495 --> 01:57:45,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1383
01:57:45,935 --> 01:57:46,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1384
01:57:46,436 --> 01:57:46,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sorry.

1385
01:57:46,916 --> 01:57:46,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1386
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:50,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what it is to answer your question there, Rob.

1387
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:55,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember before, you had to have a certain game in there and it would be in that mode or whatever.

1388
01:57:55,844 --> 01:58:02,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So you had to have Nintendogs in your system and they had to have Nintendogs and it would detect that.

1389
01:58:03,231 --> 01:58:17,771
[SPEAKER_06]: this will pick up anything regardless of what game it is so say for example I have Mario Kart and Nintendogs and someone else has Mario Kart and Nintendogs but they're playing like Street Fighter 4 or something like that it'll still tag my system with all their other crap

1390
01:58:18,692 --> 01:58:21,773
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some clarifications from our chatroom at chat.orangeontradio.com.

1391
01:58:21,793 --> 01:58:24,933
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw is clarifying the 3D YouTube videos are the red and blue.

1392
01:58:25,313 --> 01:58:28,734
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have the red and blue glasses, you can watch some 3D videos on YouTube.

1393
01:58:29,834 --> 01:58:32,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they have that, but there's also the other ones, too.

1394
01:58:32,214 --> 01:58:33,915
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have multiple versions of 3D.

1395
01:58:34,255 --> 01:58:39,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's people making self-made 3D stuff right now, but it's just very limited.

1396
01:58:40,596 --> 01:58:42,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Zam in our chatroom says, Nintendo?

1397
01:58:42,316 --> 01:58:42,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Smart?

1398
01:58:42,756 --> 01:58:44,397
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like PS3 unhackable.

1399
01:58:46,117 --> 01:58:46,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I see what you did there.

1400
01:58:49,216 --> 01:58:51,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Salacious Pop, what do you have for us?

1401
01:58:53,101 --> 01:59:22,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure why you put this particular story in the news feed it's amazing because I used to work in adult entertainment and I'm sure if Jamie got this story she would just be flustered and annoyed but a company named Ddub Software is putting out a porno triple X rated indie game called Bonecraft based off of Blizzard's World of Warcraft lore where it's like inspired by but obviously it's close enough to where they can't I guess get sued

1402
01:59:23,197 --> 01:59:49,427
[SPEAKER_09]: but yeah so Ddub Software who also put out games I'm trying to find Bone Town Bone Town is another game of theirs and the Tiger Woods sex game I guess plot summary somewhere in the galaxy there's Orcs and Elves this isn't a direct quote I'm just paraphrasing it because otherwise it would be too long Orcs and Elves running around Space Marines crash land on the planet and I guess there's something about Secret Elf

1403
01:59:51,508 --> 01:59:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm sure you move your mouse up and down to do the sex and I don't even know what this is.

1404
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:56,571
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

1405
01:59:56,631 --> 01:59:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even.

1406
01:59:57,791 --> 02:00:04,575
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Bonecraft, the Blizzard sort of StarCraft Warcraft genre.

1407
02:00:04,955 --> 02:00:05,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Porno game.

1408
02:00:05,876 --> 02:00:10,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that it's combining Warcraft and StarCraft together in its parody.

1409
02:00:10,919 --> 02:00:12,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so for those that want to...

1410
02:00:14,195 --> 02:00:17,836
[SPEAKER_09]: D-dub software and the game is Bonecraft An actual video game and not just a porno

1411
02:00:30,549 --> 02:00:39,919
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of reminds me of 30 Rock, Season 3, when Tracy Jordan was going to quit television to make the most amazing porn computer game of all time.

1412
02:00:39,939 --> 02:00:41,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anyone watches 30 Rock.

1413
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:41,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this is it.

1414
02:00:42,001 --> 02:00:44,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is what I'm thinking it is.

1415
02:00:44,984 --> 02:00:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get the creators of this on the show.

1416
02:00:46,786 --> 02:00:51,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's totally take them seriously and just be like, so tell us about the plot of your game.

1417
02:00:51,731 --> 02:00:53,133
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you envision your hero?

1418
02:00:57,335 --> 02:00:58,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, you know you want it.

1419
02:00:58,396 --> 02:01:00,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode 400, Interview with Bonecraft.

1420
02:01:00,417 --> 02:01:00,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes or no?

1421
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:01,938
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

1422
02:01:02,598 --> 02:01:03,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.

1423
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:05,760
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be the drunk show.

1424
02:01:06,001 --> 02:01:08,522
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you ask the creators of Bonecraft, Loki?

1425
02:01:09,543 --> 02:01:10,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1426
02:01:10,143 --> 02:01:13,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to learn more about their title, I guess.

1427
02:01:14,186 --> 02:01:15,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the title is Bonecraft.

1428
02:01:16,207 --> 02:01:18,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but what the hell's the game?

1429
02:01:18,769 --> 02:01:24,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Bone Town is just some really crappy avatar game where people talk dirty to each other.

1430
02:01:24,452 --> 02:01:26,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that doesn't tell me anything.

1431
02:01:28,138 --> 02:01:33,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to some more stories and then the mailbag and the FUs of the week are all coming right up.

1432
02:01:34,605 --> 02:01:38,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, what is Bonecraft?

1433
02:01:38,909 --> 02:01:41,031
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

1434
02:01:42,312 --> 02:01:43,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so, you know,

1435
02:01:44,994 --> 02:01:56,846
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP2 will be unveiled this month in Tokyo at a Sony business meeting.

1436
02:01:57,266 --> 02:02:01,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been confirmed that such a meeting is being held in Tokyo on January 27th.

1437
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:04,853
[SPEAKER_06]: This was confirmed by Sony themselves.

1438
02:02:05,194 --> 02:02:08,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they say they can't comment on anything at this time.

1439
02:02:08,997 --> 02:02:29,815
[SPEAKER_06]: which probably means that yes they are going to be announcing it at that time so that's cool so if they announce it this year I'm assuming it will probably be coming out this year it'll probably be at E3 so I guess we'll have to wait and see when that PSP 2 is coming out that doesn't exist but does exist yeah

1440
02:02:31,503 --> 02:02:31,643
[SPEAKER_07]: E3 E3 E3

1441
02:02:55,417 --> 02:02:56,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think.

1442
02:02:56,717 --> 02:03:02,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's going to be all about where they're going to go with these newfangled things they've got on consoles.

1443
02:03:02,599 --> 02:03:04,379
[SPEAKER_09]: The Kinect and the Move are here, so what's next?

1444
02:03:04,419 --> 02:03:05,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's your killer app?

1445
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:06,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see it.

1446
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't think anyone's going to be announcing a new console this year.

1447
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:17,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the Wii HD is happening at a Nintendo at this point because I think they're going to really throw everything they've got into the 3DS this year.

1448
02:03:17,582 --> 02:03:19,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's everything you're going to be seeing.

1449
02:03:20,363 --> 02:03:24,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony and Microsoft have no reason to give up what they're doing on their consoles right now

1450
02:03:25,064 --> 02:03:32,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, I guess the PSP 2 would be the one console that you're probably going to see more information about if it's not announced earlier.

1451
02:03:33,196 --> 02:03:36,441
[SPEAKER_07]: As we've heard, you know, it might actually come out with Tokyo Game Developers Conference.

1452
02:03:36,461 --> 02:03:36,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1453
02:03:37,362 --> 02:03:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Could come out a lot sooner.

1454
02:03:39,625 --> 02:03:40,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a very interesting year.

1455
02:03:41,512 --> 02:03:44,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I hopped on this generation of consoles pretty late.

1456
02:03:44,036 --> 02:03:51,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get a 360, which is the first out of the two that I got, until Christmas of 08, so a little over two years.

1457
02:03:51,685 --> 02:03:58,193
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea that the 360 is six years old or will be this summer, I can't wrap my head around that.

1458
02:03:58,894 --> 02:03:59,835
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1459
02:04:18,055 --> 02:04:20,418
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying the PS3 has a 10-year life cycle.

1460
02:04:20,478 --> 02:04:20,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1461
02:04:21,019 --> 02:04:23,222
[SPEAKER_07]: You're full of crap.

1462
02:04:23,242 --> 02:04:24,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not ready to see new hardware yet.

1463
02:04:25,024 --> 02:04:26,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not either.

1464
02:04:26,606 --> 02:04:29,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I would be a little bit pissed off if new hardware were out already.

1465
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:34,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it would be, oh, 3D, and you need 3D TVs for it and everything.

1466
02:04:35,297 --> 02:04:35,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1467
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,782
[SPEAKER_07]: You already made me buy upgrades to the current consoles with the Kinect and the Move.

1468
02:04:41,182 --> 02:04:44,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I didn't buy the Move, but give me reasons to really love these things.

1469
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:45,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have it by this summer, I'm sure.

1470
02:04:45,884 --> 02:04:47,405
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a game to necessitate it.

1471
02:04:47,465 --> 02:04:49,546
[SPEAKER_07]: There wasn't a game that necessitated me buying it.

1472
02:04:49,986 --> 02:04:56,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I would even argue that maybe I shouldn't have bought the Kinect, but I do really like Dance Central and some of the other stuff, so I'm okay with it.

1473
02:04:56,469 --> 02:04:58,570
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really don't have a reason to get a Move right now.

1474
02:04:59,070 --> 02:04:59,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

1475
02:05:00,351 --> 02:05:03,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of people out there saying, you know, DarkToagak in our chatroom says, I still don't have a 360.

1476
02:05:06,092 --> 02:05:08,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Are people still calling it next-gen consoles?

1477
02:05:08,475 --> 02:05:09,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think we're past that, right?

1478
02:05:09,936 --> 02:05:12,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I made that mistake for about two years after it was out.

1479
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:13,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Current gen.

1480
02:05:15,856 --> 02:05:16,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Next Gen, we don't know.

1481
02:05:16,916 --> 02:05:18,177
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no Next Gen yet.

1482
02:05:18,557 --> 02:05:18,877
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1483
02:05:19,537 --> 02:05:20,757
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, I don't know.

1484
02:05:20,837 --> 02:05:25,119
[SPEAKER_07]: One person that wants to play a little more in what's going on in the console world, it's GameStop.

1485
02:05:25,579 --> 02:05:29,720
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to link you with a GameStop ID on their console.

1486
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,281
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because GameStop is selling more of the digital stuff in their stores.

1487
02:05:33,801 --> 02:05:43,424
[SPEAKER_07]: They had an interview with Ars Technica not that long ago, and the senior vice president of GameStop, Sean Freeman, said that while the company's doing a good job of selling Microsoft Points cards...

1488
02:05:44,864 --> 02:05:45,324
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1489
02:06:11,145 --> 02:06:15,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I still never understood the reason why I would want to even do this.

1490
02:06:16,008 --> 02:06:26,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I mean, if you're going to, say, for example, buy download content from them, just buy a fucking 1600 point card or something like that.

1491
02:06:27,016 --> 02:06:30,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you going to give them your information for this stuff?

1492
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:38,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you're not interested in purchasing a ton of download content and you have no games to trade in, why the fuck would you ever...

1493
02:06:39,725 --> 02:06:49,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave your home, go to a store to buy something that you could just flip your console on and download straight from the marketplace and download straight to your console.

1494
02:06:49,191 --> 02:06:53,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tell you, by the time you drove to the store and back, it would already be downloaded.

1495
02:06:54,814 --> 02:07:00,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't understand why you would even waste the time to go give them money.

1496
02:07:01,785 --> 02:07:20,974
[SPEAKER_09]: and you're paying tax on top of that I'm making stink face at this whole idea to have a separate layer of a GameStop ID that's just yet another account that I have to sync with my XBLA or whatever if they want to be the middle man in that another password that could possibly get exploited yeah this is a dumb idea and I don't get it

1497
02:07:21,354 --> 02:07:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think GameStop to some extent is doing what they feel they have to do to survive.

1498
02:07:25,196 --> 02:07:32,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think we've said this on the show before that GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster Video real soon if something doesn't happen.

1499
02:07:32,739 --> 02:07:33,419
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're not.

1500
02:07:33,699 --> 02:07:34,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

1501
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:38,561
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going anywhere because they're the biggest fish in the sea out there.

1502
02:07:38,581 --> 02:07:39,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So was Blockbuster at one time.

1503
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:40,942
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.

1504
02:07:41,002 --> 02:07:50,466
[SPEAKER_06]: This is totally different because you see the game publisher or the movie studios, they don't need Blockbuster like they need GameStop because

1505
02:07:51,306 --> 02:07:52,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Blockbuster rents movies.

1506
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:53,887
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't sell movies.

1507
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:58,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, they make more money in the sell-through business than they do in the rental business.

1508
02:07:58,590 --> 02:08:03,512
[SPEAKER_06]: If Blockbuster was a big powerhouse in selling movies, that would be a different thing altogether.

1509
02:08:03,952 --> 02:08:07,014
[SPEAKER_06]: But GameStop, they're a big powerhouse when it comes to sell-through.

1510
02:08:07,334 --> 02:08:08,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately...

1511
02:08:09,395 --> 02:08:12,496
[SPEAKER_06]: They could dictate to the publishers what the fuck do they want them to do.

1512
02:08:12,696 --> 02:08:14,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So they say, you know what?

1513
02:08:14,216 --> 02:08:16,056
[SPEAKER_06]: We still want you to put physical copies out.

1514
02:08:16,336 --> 02:08:17,937
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to put physical copies out.

1515
02:08:18,397 --> 02:08:34,340
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just trying to get into the DLC stuff because they figure, hey, we can get some more money from that because we can just pay Microsoft or whatever or a small little kickback for these things, but we get some money out of that transaction, and that's more money for us because we don't actually have to sell any physical goods.

1516
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:35,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It's digital stuff now.

1517
02:08:36,300 --> 02:09:06,021
[SPEAKER_06]: so that's what that's all about I mean if they really wanted to I mean they have little cards and stuff that I guess they have made for them but that's all it's about it's not about them trying to survive it's about them being fucking greedy that's all it is they don't need to be in this business at all why are they selling well I guess I should say why are they selling PC games digitally but they are but I mean they're in no way going to be able to compete well with Steam or something it's just it's just all about them looking for more money

1518
02:09:07,919 --> 02:09:17,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at our comments from chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Brad from PodCulture says, Used to work at Blockbuster back in the day, and yes, Blockbuster does sell movies, new and used.

1519
02:09:17,386 --> 02:09:27,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they do, but they're not like a Walmart where Walmart sells hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of movies versus Blockbuster's, oh, we're bringing in some extra for sell-through.

1520
02:09:27,933 --> 02:09:29,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's way different.

1521
02:09:29,614 --> 02:09:30,254
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

1522
02:09:51,528 --> 02:09:52,269
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1523
02:10:14,522 --> 02:10:43,444
[SPEAKER_06]: now everything is released at sell-through pricing and so there's really no incentive for somebody to well I mean there is an incentive for people to rent stuff because it's still cheaper but it's less of an incentive now because they can just go to the store and buy their movie new you know because before they wouldn't be able to do that so that's why it's all shifted to you know the sell-through business and that's why Blockbuster is well it's why it's Blockbuster's failing you know that and they're losing out to you know kiosk vendors and stuff like that but

1524
02:10:43,544 --> 02:10:44,944
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura has arrived back from her event.

1525
02:10:44,964 --> 02:10:45,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.

1526
02:10:45,244 --> 02:10:45,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1527
02:10:45,404 --> 02:10:46,165
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been missed tonight.

1528
02:10:46,185 --> 02:10:46,745
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing?

1529
02:11:12,293 --> 02:11:13,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pinballed out.

1530
02:11:14,179 --> 02:11:17,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I played nothing but Rocky and Bullwinkle and I played Theater of Magic before we actually got there.

1531
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:20,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve Ritchie was there and he's really cool.

1532
02:11:45,677 --> 02:11:50,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned earlier in the show you were texting me this morning that you were rubbing elbows with some famous pinball peeps.

1533
02:11:50,919 --> 02:11:51,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

1534
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:53,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you give us an interview for the show?

1535
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,741
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but his wife and I talked for a long time and she's really sweet.

1536
02:11:57,061 --> 02:11:57,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

1537
02:11:57,601 --> 02:12:01,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dan's in there saying we probably could.

1538
02:12:02,283 --> 02:12:02,983
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really cool.

1539
02:12:03,003 --> 02:12:06,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've just sat and chatted with him before at conventions.

1540
02:12:06,544 --> 02:12:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1541
02:12:07,044 --> 02:12:09,185
[SPEAKER_07]: What tables did he work on?

1542
02:12:09,545 --> 02:12:14,727
[SPEAKER_04]: He did No Fear and Black Knight, which are both ones that we have, and he did the voices in them.

1543
02:12:14,987 --> 02:12:16,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right, because you're very proud of your autograph.

1544
02:12:16,908 --> 02:12:17,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1545
02:12:17,168 --> 02:12:19,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, just come in here and answer the damn question.

1546
02:12:20,269 --> 02:12:22,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan just been driving for two hours.

1547
02:12:22,290 --> 02:12:23,110
[SPEAKER_07]: You was away.

1548
02:12:23,170 --> 02:12:24,251
[SPEAKER_07]: You were like in the Bay Area, right?

1549
02:12:25,311 --> 02:12:27,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, somewhere near French Camp.

1550
02:12:28,204 --> 02:12:29,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's not down by Stockton.

1551
02:12:29,504 --> 02:12:29,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1552
02:12:29,764 --> 02:12:30,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just past Stockton.

1553
02:12:31,125 --> 02:12:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're going the other way.

1554
02:12:31,985 --> 02:12:33,945
[SPEAKER_04]: But we rode with someone in Davis.

1555
02:12:34,425 --> 02:12:38,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we gave the update from Davis.

1556
02:12:38,166 --> 02:12:38,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.

1557
02:12:38,866 --> 02:12:39,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.

1558
02:12:40,046 --> 02:12:41,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But I played a lot of Rocky and Bullwinkle.

1559
02:12:42,507 --> 02:12:47,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a Whirlwind and Safecracker, I think, was one of them.

1560
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:51,708
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a really, really pretty Twilight Zone.

1561
02:12:52,448 --> 02:12:54,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Like with the topper and everything.

1562
02:12:55,269 --> 02:12:55,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1563
02:12:57,205 --> 02:12:58,286
[SPEAKER_04]: All kinds of good stuff.

1564
02:12:58,346 --> 02:12:59,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, would you like a chair?

1565
02:13:02,928 --> 02:13:03,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry for the dead air.

1566
02:13:03,829 --> 02:13:07,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting hammered with chat and chairs, switcheroo and all that at once.

1567
02:13:07,431 --> 02:13:09,632
[SPEAKER_07]: He hit him with a metal chair!

1568
02:13:09,652 --> 02:13:10,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom!

1569
02:13:11,493 --> 02:13:12,073
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1570
02:13:13,434 --> 02:13:23,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was pretty fun and then my hips started to hurt and I started to get grumpy so I sat down and got on my laptop for a little bit and had a lot of beer.

1571
02:13:23,868 --> 02:13:24,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Good time.

1572
02:13:24,508 --> 02:13:25,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've been drinking a little bit.

1573
02:13:25,969 --> 02:13:27,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Three Newcastles and a Guinness.

1574
02:13:27,169 --> 02:13:27,730
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a lot.

1575
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:28,510
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nothing for you.

1576
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,691
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have seen me last night.

1577
02:13:30,171 --> 02:13:31,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned this earlier on the show.

1578
02:13:31,311 --> 02:13:36,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I was out with Rice Princess and Extifer and Grandpa Warcraft from the other show and Salacious Pop here.

1579
02:13:37,174 --> 02:13:39,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We were all out and I got drunk.

1580
02:13:39,375 --> 02:13:42,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I made an ass of myself in front of Rice Princess and Extifer.

1581
02:13:44,157 --> 02:13:46,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I actually will... Oh, sorry, you were muted there.

1582
02:13:46,359 --> 02:13:47,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

1583
02:13:47,621 --> 02:13:51,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so drunk that he agreed to go to Denny's for the after bar food.

1584
02:13:51,765 --> 02:13:53,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate Denny's with a passion.

1585
02:13:54,127 --> 02:13:57,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just burned out on Denny's in my early 20s, right?

1586
02:13:57,550 --> 02:13:59,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was the post-club place to go.

1587
02:13:59,752 --> 02:14:03,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, keep in mind, for the rest of you guys that aren't in California, we don't really have diners here.

1588
02:14:03,716 --> 02:14:05,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, diners are unheard of here.

1589
02:14:05,117 --> 02:14:06,979
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no such thing as a Waffle House restaurant.

1590
02:14:07,079 --> 02:14:08,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a shame.

1591
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:09,601
[SPEAKER_07]: No mom-pa diners.

1592
02:14:09,621 --> 02:14:10,142
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing like that.

1593
02:14:10,162 --> 02:14:10,782
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Denny's.

1594
02:14:10,962 --> 02:14:12,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's.

1595
02:14:12,343 --> 02:14:12,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Everywhere.

1596
02:14:12,664 --> 02:14:14,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Lion's and we had Eppie's.

1597
02:14:14,705 --> 02:14:15,846
[SPEAKER_07]: None of them are 24 hours anymore.

1598
02:14:16,367 --> 02:14:16,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're gone.

1599
02:14:17,128 --> 02:14:18,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it's Denny's.

1600
02:14:18,789 --> 02:14:21,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And last night when I was drunk, I wanted chicken strips.

1601
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:23,372
[SPEAKER_07]: They sobered him right up.

1602
02:14:24,092 --> 02:14:25,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Greasy chicken strips, a good hangover cure.

1603
02:14:25,835 --> 02:14:35,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you remember my last super drunk time that I was hanging out with you, other than the time at Tia's when they lit up in the apartment and it made me throw up, was the waffles.

1604
02:14:36,648 --> 02:14:37,349
[SPEAKER_04]: The waffle incident.

1605
02:14:40,276 --> 02:14:41,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Carby stuff, Rob.

1606
02:14:41,497 --> 02:14:43,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the greasy Carby stuff.

1607
02:14:43,479 --> 02:14:43,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1608
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:46,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I should pull up the chat room.

1609
02:14:46,561 --> 02:14:50,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be very proud of... We've gotten through most of your news tonight already.

1610
02:14:50,244 --> 02:14:51,525
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be very proud of Salacious Pop.

1611
02:14:51,545 --> 02:14:52,466
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a fine job.

1612
02:14:53,346 --> 02:14:54,647
[SPEAKER_07]: He picked the classic game of the week tonight.

1613
02:14:54,667 --> 02:14:55,628
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

1614
02:14:55,688 --> 02:14:56,309
[SPEAKER_07]: King's Quest IV.

1615
02:14:57,229 --> 02:14:57,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

1616
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, of course, the Rosella, yeah, game, which was one of the best in the series.

1617
02:15:01,635 --> 02:15:02,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

1618
02:15:02,135 --> 02:15:05,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Figured since, you know, you tend to give Sega a lot of love.

1619
02:15:05,519 --> 02:15:07,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Sega deserves my love.

1620
02:15:07,642 --> 02:15:10,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Salacious Pop went to the PC market, which I thought was cool.

1621
02:15:10,525 --> 02:15:14,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did determine today on the ride back that Sega makes crappy pinball tables.

1622
02:15:16,292 --> 02:15:24,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to the mailbag you guys at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and sadly there's not a lot in the mailbag tonight.

1623
02:15:25,883 --> 02:15:27,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my mailbag music?

1624
02:15:27,545 --> 02:15:28,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there Viagra spam?

1625
02:15:29,007 --> 02:15:29,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can just read that.

1626
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:32,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Not this week.

1627
02:15:32,510 --> 02:15:34,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go ahead and do it since DarkSakura is still getting set up.

1628
02:15:34,371 --> 02:15:36,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to be uncomfortably hard?

1629
02:15:36,812 --> 02:15:41,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also, a lot of it's my fault with the whole lack of podcast feed updating.

1630
02:15:41,913 --> 02:15:45,554
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, a new show went up today and we'll continue throughout the three-day weekend.

1631
02:15:45,574 --> 02:15:47,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I have tomorrow off, so I'm going to work on OLR stuff.

1632
02:15:47,915 --> 02:15:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I forget, 71 is...

1633
02:15:52,029 --> 02:15:52,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1634
02:16:10,922 --> 02:16:15,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, some bonehead did something really, really, really, really, really bad.

1635
02:16:16,145 --> 02:16:18,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's making a lot of people think differently.

1636
02:16:19,047 --> 02:16:22,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And in response... Let me read the email here from Rob.

1637
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:28,813
[SPEAKER_07]: In response to Jared Lee Lauder gun attack, it appears the following article replaces video games with political rhetoric.

1638
02:16:29,233 --> 02:16:31,837
[SPEAKER_07]: The article is good, even though the study mentioned is weak.

1639
02:16:43,223 --> 02:16:49,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, they just kind of go through this study and they just replace the words video games with violent rhetoric.

1640
02:16:49,805 --> 02:16:52,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of like, gee, haven't we seen this whole thing before?

1641
02:16:53,026 --> 02:16:53,487
[SPEAKER_07]: IDK.

1642
02:16:54,067 --> 02:17:01,709
[SPEAKER_07]: But Rob says, My point of view, and I know I've said this before in a mailbag letter, is that a person is solely responsible for what influences him or her.

1643
02:17:02,169 --> 02:17:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Although from what I've read of the Arizona shooting, the shooter was extremely mentally ill and without treatment.

1644
02:17:06,891 --> 02:17:12,493
[SPEAKER_07]: We may be looking at a situation where the parents did not know about paranoid schizophrenia and therefore didn't get treatment for him.

1645
02:17:12,993 --> 02:17:13,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry, though.

1646
02:17:13,694 --> 02:17:15,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games are also being blamed.

1647
02:17:15,656 --> 02:17:16,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1648
02:17:16,337 --> 02:17:16,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't they always?

1649
02:17:17,418 --> 02:17:18,279
[SPEAKER_07]: From all the 2Bs.

1650
02:17:18,499 --> 02:17:24,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just unfortunate, you know, in these times of tragedy, everybody's, you know, kind of pointing the finger at what there is to blame.

1651
02:17:25,027 --> 02:17:26,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know...

1652
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:54,129
[SPEAKER_07]: all of it's to blame to an extent but what's most to blame is this individual an individual is responsible for their actions and it's I don't know it's just it's a not an easy situation with not an easy answer to it but you know you have to look to how to prevent this type of stuff in the future and we're all going to pay for it because you know it's not going to be it's going to make our congress people less accessible in the future it's just unfortunate

1653
02:17:55,942 --> 02:17:58,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I kind of agree with Frisbee in our chat room.

1654
02:17:58,203 --> 02:17:59,283
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy is a psycho.

1655
02:17:59,443 --> 02:18:00,103
[SPEAKER_07]: End of line.

1656
02:18:00,383 --> 02:18:02,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about it.

1657
02:18:04,045 --> 02:18:04,425
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1658
02:18:04,465 --> 02:18:05,605
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for the emails this week.

1659
02:18:05,645 --> 02:18:09,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm expecting this thing to be full next week.

1660
02:18:10,307 --> 02:18:11,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Full with stories next week.

1661
02:18:12,747 --> 02:18:19,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki has another news story for us and then we're going to get to the Skype line here in just a minute at OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR

1662
02:18:22,096 --> 02:18:25,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, last thing I had to talk about, and this is not a surprise.

1663
02:18:25,717 --> 02:18:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess this is a surprise for a Wii game.

1664
02:18:28,258 --> 02:18:31,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Dance 2 has gone five times platinum.

1665
02:18:31,619 --> 02:18:33,939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, it sold five million copies.

1666
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not bad, considering the fact it came out at the end of October.

1667
02:18:39,041 --> 02:18:41,182
[SPEAKER_07]: That's way too much, Kesha, for me.

1668
02:18:41,462 --> 02:18:45,803
[SPEAKER_06]: That is insane, though, that it's done that well.

1669
02:18:47,389 --> 02:18:52,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, to put this in contrast, we just had a story earlier in the show where you were saying, Hey, Dance Central's doing great.

1670
02:18:52,132 --> 02:18:53,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It sold 1 million copies.

1671
02:18:55,074 --> 02:19:00,837
[SPEAKER_07]: We just mentioned now Just Dance has sold 5 million copies.

1672
02:19:00,857 --> 02:19:03,699
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like Just Dance Franchise has sold 5 million copies.

1673
02:19:03,799 --> 02:19:06,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this one game has sold 5 million copies.

1674
02:19:06,781 --> 02:19:07,941
[SPEAKER_06]: That is crazy.

1675
02:19:08,142 --> 02:19:10,043
[SPEAKER_06]: It is so popular.

1676
02:19:11,525 --> 02:19:16,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised that Ubisoft hasn't brought the Just Dance franchise to other consoles now.

1677
02:19:17,001 --> 02:19:18,666
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the Move and the Kinect stuff.

1678
02:19:19,218 --> 02:19:23,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Michael Jackson game, isn't that really just a Just Dance Michael Jackson game?

1679
02:19:23,339 --> 02:19:23,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

1680
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's coming out on the other systems.

1681
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you, though, that we'll see Just Dance 3 come out on all the platforms.

1682
02:19:28,321 --> 02:19:28,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure.

1683
02:19:28,961 --> 02:19:35,283
[SPEAKER_07]: The move would be stupid easy to port because it's very similar.

1684
02:19:35,703 --> 02:19:42,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Connect, a little different, and it's going to be hard to separate it now from Dance Central, kind of beat them to the punch a little bit on Connect.

1685
02:19:42,725 --> 02:19:48,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But if Dance Central and Dance Masters can kind of coexist... And Dance Paradise.

1686
02:19:48,687 --> 02:19:49,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that one.

1687
02:19:49,387 --> 02:19:50,268
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not out here, is it?

1688
02:19:50,408 --> 02:19:50,828
[SPEAKER_07]: February.

1689
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, okay.

1690
02:19:52,689 --> 02:19:54,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I guess there'll be room for this too.

1691
02:19:54,489 --> 02:19:55,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1692
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:57,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I think I've had enough dancing games.

1693
02:19:57,470 --> 02:20:03,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they need to kill each other off in a battle royale and one will be left standing, which will probably be Dance Central.

1694
02:20:03,133 --> 02:20:04,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some Highlander up in this.

1695
02:20:04,573 --> 02:20:08,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So for real, for real, I want to see the head chopped off of Dance Masters.

1696
02:20:10,695 --> 02:20:11,856
[SPEAKER_07]: There can be only one.

1697
02:20:12,056 --> 02:20:12,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1698
02:20:12,376 --> 02:20:13,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And make it be really good and I will buy that one.

1699
02:20:17,486 --> 02:20:19,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Evacuate the dance floor.

1700
02:20:19,768 --> 02:20:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, all right.

1701
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

1702
02:20:21,709 --> 02:20:23,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to one more song here.

1703
02:20:23,270 --> 02:20:23,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Or sorry, song.

1704
02:20:24,911 --> 02:20:25,832
[SPEAKER_07]: One more story here.

1705
02:20:25,892 --> 02:20:27,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it'll have a song and dance with it.

1706
02:20:27,893 --> 02:20:30,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooking Mama has arrived on Facebook.

1707
02:20:31,175 --> 02:20:31,776
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1708
02:20:32,376 --> 02:20:34,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Mama will fix Facebook now.

1709
02:20:34,197 --> 02:20:36,719
[SPEAKER_07]: The Cooking Mama franchise has arrived on Facebook this week.

1710
02:20:37,119 --> 02:20:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Friends Cafe is the name of the game.

1711
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:41,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to dub it then Clicky Mama, right?

1712
02:20:42,042 --> 02:20:42,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Clicky Mama.

1713
02:20:43,023 --> 02:20:44,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook game is click, click, click.

1714
02:20:44,164 --> 02:20:44,544
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1715
02:20:44,624 --> 02:20:45,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Clicky Mama.

1716
02:20:45,525 --> 02:20:45,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

1717
02:20:46,185 --> 02:20:46,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Mama will click it.

1718
02:20:47,706 --> 02:20:51,728
[SPEAKER_07]: You can visit the game at Facebook.com slash Cooking Mama Cafe.

1719
02:20:52,628 --> 02:20:57,110
[SPEAKER_07]: It has some of the same food preparation gameplay, of course, that you're used to seeing in the series.

1720
02:20:57,690 --> 02:21:00,872
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also unlockable upgrades for your personal kitchen.

1721
02:21:01,072 --> 02:21:03,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you can buy them as well because it's a Facebook game.

1722
02:21:04,754 --> 02:21:07,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you neglect your cafe, you will see it shut down.

1723
02:21:09,818 --> 02:21:10,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1724
02:21:10,678 --> 02:21:15,322
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see what's going on in the Cookie Mama world, you can now explore that on Facebook.

1725
02:21:16,543 --> 02:21:19,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how many people will abandon Knights of the Crystals to go play Friends Cafe.

1726
02:21:19,966 --> 02:21:20,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1727
02:21:20,726 --> 02:21:21,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I just allowed it.

1728
02:21:22,167 --> 02:21:22,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1729
02:21:22,768 --> 02:21:22,748
83.

1730
02:21:23,568 --> 02:21:25,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm level 83 in that game.

1731
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:27,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Salacious Pop is actually higher than me.

1732
02:21:27,732 --> 02:21:30,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've run out of stuff to do, really, in Knights of the Clicky.

1733
02:21:31,741 --> 02:21:33,666
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's so... Heights of the Clicky is not even a good game.

1734
02:21:33,686 --> 02:21:34,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already given up on it.

1735
02:21:34,748 --> 02:21:35,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I keep playing it?

1736
02:21:36,011 --> 02:21:38,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I click on your... Rob wants help.

1737
02:21:38,998 --> 02:21:39,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, thank you.

1738
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:40,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1739
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:40,682
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1740
02:21:42,001 --> 02:21:44,444
[SPEAKER_07]: They have released new stages, quote unquote.

1741
02:21:44,464 --> 02:21:47,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I just unlocked the Merman from doing the underwater stages.

1742
02:21:48,087 --> 02:21:49,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's about all they do.

1743
02:21:49,328 --> 02:21:52,451
[SPEAKER_09]: But for every new map that they open up, they also release one.

1744
02:21:52,671 --> 02:21:54,053
[SPEAKER_09]: It only requires pay items.

1745
02:21:54,353 --> 02:21:54,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1746
02:21:54,753 --> 02:21:55,474
[SPEAKER_09]: To progress in.

1747
02:21:55,554 --> 02:21:56,315
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it works.

1748
02:21:56,875 --> 02:21:57,396
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1749
02:21:57,656 --> 02:22:00,138
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all going to shit when the Civilization game comes out.

1750
02:22:00,158 --> 02:22:00,839
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I feel.

1751
02:22:00,899 --> 02:22:02,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that damn Civilization game now.

1752
02:22:03,582 --> 02:22:06,024
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when you'll dust off your credit card for a Facebook title.

1753
02:22:06,144 --> 02:22:06,344
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.

1754
02:22:06,364 --> 02:22:06,645
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.

1755
02:22:07,385 --> 02:22:08,686
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.

1756
02:22:08,726 --> 02:22:09,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It is open right now.

1757
02:22:09,687 --> 02:22:10,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

1758
02:22:10,928 --> 02:22:11,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

1759
02:22:11,268 --> 02:22:12,329
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to do the FUs of the week.

1760
02:22:13,210 --> 02:22:15,391
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still... We didn't do the FUs of the week yet.

1761
02:22:15,732 --> 02:22:15,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1762
02:22:16,252 --> 02:22:17,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bad.

1763
02:22:17,793 --> 02:22:18,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a bad thing.

1764
02:22:18,614 --> 02:22:19,655
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't get the angst out.

1765
02:22:19,755 --> 02:22:24,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Rob, you're so... I was just distracted by you getting back to the studio.

1766
02:22:24,779 --> 02:22:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I DJing so bad?

1767
02:22:36,122 --> 02:22:38,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, F you to my hip.

1768
02:22:40,047 --> 02:22:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucker.

1769
02:22:41,489 --> 02:22:41,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

1770
02:22:42,851 --> 02:22:43,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious pop.

1771
02:22:45,667 --> 02:22:50,090
[SPEAKER_09]: F you, I guess, to me not really knowing how awesome Panera Bread is up until just recently.

1772
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:56,515
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty good month so far, so no angst.

1773
02:22:57,076 --> 02:23:06,804
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that I have a very tough decision coming up, and I think I know what I'm going to do, and it's not going to make some people very happy with me, but in the end, I know that it's the thing I've got to do.

1774
02:23:07,404 --> 02:23:10,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It has nothing to do with this program or anything you guys know about me, so it's just...

1775
02:23:11,107 --> 02:23:13,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being cryptical on purpose, but I don't like these tough decisions.

1776
02:23:13,369 --> 02:23:14,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I know what it is.

1777
02:23:14,591 --> 02:23:14,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you do?

1778
02:23:15,151 --> 02:23:15,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1779
02:23:15,491 --> 02:23:15,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you do.

1780
02:23:16,192 --> 02:23:16,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So does Jamie.

1781
02:23:16,933 --> 02:23:17,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1782
02:23:17,714 --> 02:23:18,655
[SPEAKER_07]: But sorry, listeners.

1783
02:23:18,895 --> 02:23:19,375
[SPEAKER_07]: It's private.

1784
02:23:19,696 --> 02:23:19,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1785
02:23:21,231 --> 02:23:25,953
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to my JTAG constantly broken and it was really broken.

1786
02:23:25,973 --> 02:23:37,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually sent it away to be reballed, which is where they pull the chips off and they put new solder balls on them and actually upleaven them how they should have been and that didn't even fix it.

1787
02:23:37,717 --> 02:23:41,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's broke.

1788
02:23:42,399 --> 02:23:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

1789
02:23:45,683 --> 02:23:48,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the Skype line, but we're going to start the Skype line tonight with something a little special.

1790
02:23:49,005 --> 02:23:59,892
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually going to place a call right now and get him on the line here so we can get an update on what's going on with one of our partner shows.

1791
02:23:59,952 --> 02:24:01,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Bresla, are you there?

1792
02:24:01,994 --> 02:24:02,254
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1793
02:24:02,394 --> 02:24:02,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1794
02:24:02,834 --> 02:24:04,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Bresla, how you doing?

1795
02:24:04,415 --> 02:24:04,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1796
02:24:05,336 --> 02:24:05,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1797
02:24:05,656 --> 02:24:05,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1798
02:24:06,136 --> 02:24:06,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1799
02:24:07,157 --> 02:24:07,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1800
02:24:07,497 --> 02:24:08,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Guy, hi.

1801
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:08,698
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1802
02:24:08,998 --> 02:24:09,218
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1803
02:24:09,498 --> 02:24:10,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.

1804
02:24:10,902 --> 02:24:13,103
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of shit that gets in there, honestly.

1805
02:24:13,283 --> 02:24:15,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I voted on the current brackets and there's some weird shit in there.

1806
02:24:40,529 --> 02:24:47,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's because people like SSJ100Matt say, hey, Blade of Steel number one, and then it gets a 12 seed.

1807
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:53,843
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyways, voting for the Bresla region actually closes in about half an hour.

1808
02:24:55,044 --> 02:25:00,610
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first region, it'll close, and then I'll announce the next line of games when we get into the real meat and potatoes.

1809
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:02,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, Chrono Trigger comes to play.

1810
02:25:02,512 --> 02:25:03,252
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all that happens.

1811
02:25:04,353 --> 02:25:07,594
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have some scores here of some games I thought y'all would be interested in.

1812
02:25:07,994 --> 02:25:08,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty.

1813
02:25:09,034 --> 02:25:12,355
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll start with the OLR region because it's your region.

1814
02:25:15,256 --> 02:25:19,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Secret of Mana is beating Katamari Namashi right now.

1815
02:25:19,977 --> 02:25:20,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty close.

1816
02:25:21,178 --> 02:25:22,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Quake is losing to Half-Life.

1817
02:25:23,561 --> 02:25:23,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1818
02:25:24,122 --> 02:25:25,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm okay with both of those.

1819
02:25:25,483 --> 02:25:26,624
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Quake and Half-Life.

1820
02:25:26,964 --> 02:25:32,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes, and the weird thing about USL Madness is that sometimes the pairings are really hard early on.

1821
02:25:32,549 --> 02:25:42,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, that's true of any tournament-style competition, but sometimes the pairings this early on, like Quake versus Half-Life, those are both games that deserve to move on, but just the way the brackets are set up, it's not going to happen.

1822
02:25:43,138 --> 02:25:44,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and...

1823
02:25:45,885 --> 02:25:47,126
[SPEAKER_08]: What else was I going to say about that?

1824
02:25:47,727 --> 02:25:49,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3 last year.

1825
02:25:49,969 --> 02:25:52,852
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just probably one of the toughest decisions I had to make.

1826
02:25:52,933 --> 02:25:58,659
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, at that point, there really only needed to be one Mega Man game that represents them all, you know?

1827
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:28,860
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah but moving on the last one and this is a Bimani one so I had to throw it in there Parapara Paradise is narrowly losing to Sinistar right now that is such a weird matchup yeah I don't know how that works you know what though as much as I love my dancey games I don't think Parapara is the dancey game I would choose to represent sorry Misty I know you're going to hate me for that but Sinistar did bring us the whole beware I live which is pretty awesome

1828
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:34,782
[SPEAKER_08]: But moving on to the Harper region, WoW is barely beating Bionic Commando.

1829
02:26:35,062 --> 02:26:36,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's by like a vote.

1830
02:26:36,662 --> 02:26:37,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1831
02:26:37,663 --> 02:26:38,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

1832
02:26:39,723 --> 02:26:45,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Pong is beating System Shock in probably the most bizarre first round matchup and it's beating it pretty soundly.

1833
02:26:47,346 --> 02:26:48,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a head scratcher.

1834
02:26:48,646 --> 02:26:50,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Kingdom Hearts is beating Arkham Asylum.

1835
02:26:52,788 --> 02:26:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1836
02:26:54,289 --> 02:27:08,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, knowing the listeners of this show that mostly prefer the import stuff, I mean, if I were to say the majority of the listeners, not all of them, but I know the majority of our folks are kind of into the Squeenix import stuff, that doesn't surprise me.

1837
02:27:10,169 --> 02:27:14,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't speak for USL, but I know we have a lot of the same listeners, so it wouldn't surprise me.

1838
02:27:35,926 --> 02:27:37,748
[SPEAKER_08]: As it doesn't need to be.

1839
02:27:37,988 --> 02:27:39,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking good for it.

1840
02:27:39,790 --> 02:27:43,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And speaking of Blades of Steel, it's losing to Dragon Quest IX right now pretty badly.

1841
02:27:44,194 --> 02:27:44,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch.

1842
02:27:45,615 --> 02:27:46,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to the wrestler region.

1843
02:27:46,997 --> 02:27:50,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also not saying all of these games because it would be 32 matchups.

1844
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:54,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be here forever and Rob, Jamie, and Loki have things to do tonight.

1845
02:27:54,363 --> 02:27:58,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Where can you kind of like follow the action on what's going on at USL Madness?

1846
02:27:59,868 --> 02:28:09,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been posting the results, but time and again I will every day post like, oh hey, this matchup's close, or this region needs votes.

1847
02:28:09,291 --> 02:28:11,731
[SPEAKER_08]: The OLR region really needs votes right now.

1848
02:28:13,412 --> 02:28:15,512
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm going to finally go to the wrestler region here.

1849
02:28:17,013 --> 02:28:20,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy X is just barely beating Crazy Taxi.

1850
02:28:23,475 --> 02:28:27,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Borderlands is beating the ever-loving snot out of the Call of Duty series.

1851
02:28:28,036 --> 02:28:28,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Which

1852
02:28:29,665 --> 02:28:34,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one was like, that could go either way, but I wouldn't be upset if Borderlands won.

1853
02:28:35,048 --> 02:28:37,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And then here's probably the most interesting one.

1854
02:28:37,189 --> 02:28:43,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Tecmo Super Bowl is losing to Halo Reach by about 10% right now.

1855
02:28:43,613 --> 02:28:47,495
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that is not even the Halo game that should be representing the Halo franchise, I'm sorry.

1856
02:28:47,675 --> 02:28:49,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo 2, all the way.

1857
02:28:49,676 --> 02:28:53,298
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was Halo 2 beating it, then I'd be a little more sympathetic, but Halo Reach, no.

1858
02:28:53,799 --> 02:28:54,039
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1859
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:57,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but those are just some of the matchups.

1860
02:28:58,441 --> 02:29:00,802
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to vote, I will post the link again in chat.

1861
02:29:01,202 --> 02:29:05,404
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're listening live, the Breslau region closes in 20 minutes.

1862
02:29:05,424 --> 02:29:08,125
[SPEAKER_07]: So you better vote now, bitches.

1863
02:29:08,865 --> 02:29:15,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Donovan region will close Monday night, Harper region will close Wednesday night, and since I was late on OLR, OLR region will close Friday night.

1864
02:29:16,348 --> 02:29:19,789
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and you'll be posting all the updates in our forums at orangelaunchradio.com, correct?

1865
02:29:20,103 --> 02:29:26,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and probably here before you guys sign off, I will have the results of the Breastler region so you see what games go on and what faces what.

1866
02:29:26,867 --> 02:29:27,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sounds good.

1867
02:29:28,569 --> 02:29:29,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for putting this all together.

1868
02:29:29,689 --> 02:29:31,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little fun, nerd stuff, but fun.

1869
02:29:32,671 --> 02:29:36,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I gotta ask before I go, who do you got this year?

1870
02:29:36,634 --> 02:29:37,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Who do you think's gonna win?

1871
02:29:37,574 --> 02:29:38,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Who do I think's gonna win this year?

1872
02:29:38,775 --> 02:29:39,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh, Super Metroid.

1873
02:29:39,996 --> 02:29:41,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to reclaim the throne, of course.

1874
02:29:43,718 --> 02:29:45,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be upset if Final Fantasy VI won.

1875
02:29:47,559 --> 02:29:50,424
[SPEAKER_07]: For a game that... Because Final Fantasy VI has never won before, right?

1876
02:29:50,804 --> 02:29:52,747
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it got to the finals for the first time last year.

1877
02:29:52,767 --> 02:29:53,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be okay with that.

1878
02:29:53,909 --> 02:29:56,613
[SPEAKER_07]: What other games have gotten really close but haven't won yet?

1879
02:29:56,973 --> 02:29:57,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1880
02:29:58,393 --> 02:30:04,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Super Mario Bros.

1881
02:30:04,195 --> 02:30:06,096
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mega Man 2 all have gotten really close.

1882
02:30:06,196 --> 02:30:10,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be okay with any of those winning the whole thing except for Ocarina of Time.

1883
02:30:14,680 --> 02:30:16,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Ocarina of Time is just like Chrono Trigger to me.

1884
02:30:16,541 --> 02:30:19,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand everybody's heart on for it.

1885
02:30:19,722 --> 02:30:21,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Link to the Past forever.

1886
02:30:22,623 --> 02:30:23,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1887
02:30:23,323 --> 02:30:24,684
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, guys, that's it.

1888
02:30:24,884 --> 02:30:29,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I will talk to you guys probably next week here, and y'all have a good night.

1889
02:30:29,105 --> 02:30:30,245
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you too, Brest Lowell.

1890
02:30:30,265 --> 02:30:31,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, and good luck with USL.

1891
02:30:32,125 --> 02:30:35,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And keep Donovan and Jessica Harper in check for us.

1892
02:30:36,606 --> 02:30:37,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try.

1893
02:30:37,547 --> 02:30:37,827
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1894
02:30:38,947 --> 02:30:39,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1895
02:30:39,867 --> 02:30:40,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1896
02:30:41,168 --> 02:30:41,548
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1897
02:30:41,788 --> 02:30:44,708
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open for everyone.

1898
02:30:44,768 --> 02:30:45,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1899
02:30:45,429 --> 02:30:45,669
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1900
02:30:47,569 --> 02:30:49,589
[SPEAKER_07]: or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1901
02:30:49,609 --> 02:30:52,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go right to the phones because they've been ringing while we were on that last call.

1902
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:53,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1903
02:30:53,130 --> 02:30:53,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1904
02:30:56,431 --> 02:30:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1905
02:30:57,371 --> 02:30:58,371
[SPEAKER_07]: We're off to a great start tonight.

1906
02:30:58,391 --> 02:30:59,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1907
02:30:59,551 --> 02:30:59,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1908
02:31:01,352 --> 02:31:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, guys?

1909
02:31:02,092 --> 02:31:02,792
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kaijudo.

1910
02:31:03,012 --> 02:31:03,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Kaijudo.

1911
02:31:03,852 --> 02:31:04,272
[SPEAKER_07]: There you are.

1912
02:31:04,312 --> 02:31:04,792
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, buddy?

1913
02:31:06,193 --> 02:31:06,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

1914
02:31:06,673 --> 02:31:08,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I just called to recommend a game to you guys.

1915
02:31:09,153 --> 02:31:09,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.

1916
02:31:09,653 --> 02:31:09,993
[SPEAKER_01]: What game?

1917
02:31:10,133 --> 02:31:12,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a PC game.

1918
02:31:12,054 --> 02:31:12,894
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a first-person shooter.

1919
02:31:13,601 --> 02:31:17,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you all talking about you were fans of the original GoldenEye for the N64.

1920
02:31:18,203 --> 02:31:19,723
[SPEAKER_07]: The original GoldenEye was pretty badass.

1921
02:31:19,763 --> 02:31:20,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it.

1922
02:31:21,464 --> 02:31:23,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well then you need to pick up this mod.

1923
02:31:24,505 --> 02:31:25,485
[SPEAKER_01]: You need Steam, of course.

1924
02:31:25,525 --> 02:31:27,646
[SPEAKER_01]: You need either Half-Life 2.

1925
02:31:27,706 --> 02:31:30,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get into all of the games, but you know what I'm saying when I say you need a Valve game.

1926
02:31:31,007 --> 02:31:35,029
[SPEAKER_01]: You need Half-Life 2 or Portal or Team Fortress.

1927
02:31:35,049 --> 02:31:35,889
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of those.

1928
02:31:36,209 --> 02:31:37,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, is it Team Fortress?

1929
02:31:37,390 --> 02:31:37,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

1930
02:31:38,150 --> 02:31:40,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, which is just $4.99.

1931
02:31:41,055 --> 02:31:47,403
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that and then you can download this GoldenEye Source mod, which is the best freaking game, period, that I've ever played.

1932
02:31:48,228 --> 02:31:49,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you all need to check it out.

1933
02:31:50,448 --> 02:31:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1934
02:31:50,968 --> 02:31:51,789
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a big Half-Life fan.

1935
02:31:51,989 --> 02:31:57,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I am hugely into Half-Life 2 and the Source Half-Life 2 engine.

1936
02:31:57,090 --> 02:32:04,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played a ton of mods and add-ons, expansions that are fan-made for Half-Life 2 and I know exactly what he's talking about.

1937
02:32:04,431 --> 02:32:07,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't checked it out, but yeah, I will now.

1938
02:32:07,771 --> 02:32:08,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard of this.

1939
02:32:08,952 --> 02:32:10,372
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks pretty awesome.

1940
02:32:10,412 --> 02:32:11,392
[SPEAKER_01]: They just went out of beta.

1941
02:32:12,252 --> 02:32:13,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe people have played it before.

1942
02:32:15,173 --> 02:32:16,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it was version 2, version 3, and

1943
02:32:17,614 --> 02:32:23,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they didn't like it, but this new update, the release version, oh my god, it'll blow you away.

1944
02:32:23,498 --> 02:32:25,199
[SPEAKER_01]: The maps are just incredible.

1945
02:32:25,659 --> 02:32:29,381
[SPEAKER_01]: The best first-person shooter maps you'll ever play, and a first-person shooter to date.

1946
02:32:30,082 --> 02:32:30,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean that.

1947
02:32:30,982 --> 02:32:35,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'll ban myself from all games if you guys don't like that game.

1948
02:32:37,644 --> 02:32:38,884
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do that.

1949
02:32:39,465 --> 02:32:40,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has different opinions.

1950
02:32:40,885 --> 02:32:42,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check it out, especially if it's kind of cheap.

1951
02:32:42,466 --> 02:32:43,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I already have Half-Life 2.

1952
02:32:44,107 --> 02:32:45,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember if I have it on PC.

1953
02:32:45,908 --> 02:32:47,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've been playing it on Xbox.

1954
02:32:47,389 --> 02:32:52,191
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have Portal and Team Fortress.

1955
02:32:52,331 --> 02:32:54,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal should be enough by itself.

1956
02:32:54,732 --> 02:33:00,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Any game that uses the source SDK in the Half-Life 2 family will let you run this add-on.

1957
02:33:00,495 --> 02:33:01,376
[SPEAKER_07]: So Portal should do it.

1958
02:33:03,534 --> 02:33:07,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll have to check that out, and we'll see if this guy gets banned from all games forever.

1959
02:33:07,297 --> 02:33:08,017
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1960
02:33:08,197 --> 02:33:09,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Me mishearing you for a second, Rob.

1961
02:33:09,818 --> 02:33:10,418
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean it, though.

1962
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:12,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious about this.

1963
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:13,781
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to check that game out.

1964
02:33:13,821 --> 02:33:15,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these guys need to be supported.

1965
02:33:15,862 --> 02:33:19,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they spent about five years making this mod, and it really shows.

1966
02:33:19,944 --> 02:33:27,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the maps are just... I mean, they have the original maps from the N64 game, and then they built their own maps, and you're just like...

1967
02:33:28,217 --> 02:33:29,761
[SPEAKER_01]: How the heck can they do all this?

1968
02:33:29,781 --> 02:33:30,844
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really great.

1969
02:34:01,434 --> 02:34:02,635
[SPEAKER_09]: His hair, of course, his hair.

1970
02:34:02,655 --> 02:34:04,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakfast Club Frag Edition.

1971
02:34:04,917 --> 02:34:05,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1972
02:34:05,517 --> 02:34:11,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you've got your different classes, your cliques, and they're a different class.

1973
02:34:12,642 --> 02:34:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: The cheerleader is athletic and can kick people in the face and has the booby attack.

1974
02:34:19,247 --> 02:34:19,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1975
02:34:20,067 --> 02:34:23,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the football player who's really big and stupid.

1976
02:34:25,236 --> 02:34:28,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I played the Wii version first, and then when I got on GoldenEye Source, I mean, it totally...

1977
02:34:53,533 --> 02:34:56,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Dwarf, the Wii's version, the online part of it.

1978
02:34:56,154 --> 02:35:04,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't have a story version, and I do like the Wii's story version of GoldenEye, but multiplayer, there's nothing like it.

1979
02:35:04,176 --> 02:35:05,136
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to check it out.

1980
02:35:05,696 --> 02:35:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: When I last heard of this GoldenEye mod specifically, it was still in alpha, and this was months and months ago, which is why I never checked it out, but the one Half-Life 2 mod I really need to come out this year is Black Mesa, the Half-Life 1 remake.

1981
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:40,184
[SPEAKER_09]: that's been vaporware for six years and now that this GoldenEye is actually in beta and going to have a release version soon this needs to light the fire under the butt of those that are working on Black Mesa Source I need it to happen well unfortunately we lost the caller there I don't know if he accidentally hung up on us or if there was a connection issue I swear I didn't click a button to hang up on him

1982
02:35:40,564 --> 02:35:44,726
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Kaijudo, thank you so much for the call and we will definitely check out that game in the future.

1983
02:35:44,806 --> 02:35:46,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So, our Skype line is back open again.

1984
02:35:46,527 --> 02:35:48,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1985
02:35:48,288 --> 02:35:49,989
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number.

1986
02:35:50,009 --> 02:35:50,709
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give us a call.

1987
02:35:51,349 --> 02:35:54,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just throw over to Loki real quick if you have any last minute stories you want to throw out there.

1988
02:35:55,031 --> 02:35:55,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1989
02:35:55,531 --> 02:35:56,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Just real quick.

1990
02:35:56,452 --> 02:35:58,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade Infinity is not closing after all.

1991
02:35:59,813 --> 02:36:00,313
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1992
02:36:00,654 --> 02:36:02,555
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a story about that on our very own website.

1993
02:36:03,775 --> 02:36:06,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, they still had a big party this weekend, though, just to kind of celebrate.

1994
02:36:07,497 --> 02:36:09,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So many people were wanting to go out anyway, so...

1995
02:36:11,437 --> 02:36:14,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Brad, I haven't heard from you in a long time, how are you doing buddy?

1996
02:36:37,337 --> 02:36:38,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Short, fat, and going bald.

1997
02:36:39,699 --> 02:36:40,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like me.

1998
02:36:41,940 --> 02:36:44,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's new in your world besides fat?

1999
02:36:44,582 --> 02:36:46,143
[SPEAKER_11]: DC Universe Online.

2000
02:36:46,503 --> 02:36:47,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, of course.

2001
02:36:47,264 --> 02:36:49,285
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of nerds very happy that this is out this week.

2002
02:36:49,305 --> 02:36:49,825
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

2003
02:36:50,586 --> 02:36:51,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm loving it.

2004
02:36:51,907 --> 02:36:56,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still got its issues, like any of those kind of games at launch.

2005
02:36:58,051 --> 02:37:00,952
[SPEAKER_11]: But I am really digging it because I am a huge comic book nerd.

2006
02:37:00,972 --> 02:37:01,973
[SPEAKER_07]: PS3 or a PC?

2007
02:37:02,013 --> 02:37:02,113
[SPEAKER_07]: PS3.

2008
02:37:05,126 --> 02:37:05,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

2009
02:37:06,607 --> 02:37:13,654
[SPEAKER_11]: The way the controls feel, it actually feels like it's made for a console.

2010
02:37:14,076 --> 02:37:42,271
[SPEAKER_07]: you're actually right in that regard I think because even when I was playing it on the PC I plugged in the Xbox 360 controller which is a little weird because the game wasn't made for that but it works and what's really interesting too is that when you do plug in the joystick all the little button symbols change to the PlayStation X's and O's which is weird if you're using a 360 controller but if you've been gaming long enough you know where those buttons are by you know feel so you can figure it out so cool were you playing a hero or a villain

2011
02:37:43,273 --> 02:37:44,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now playing a hero.

2012
02:37:45,722 --> 02:37:46,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And how's that going?

2013
02:37:46,344 --> 02:37:47,006
[SPEAKER_07]: What level are you?

2014
02:37:48,129 --> 02:37:50,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I am about back up to where I was with the beta.

2015
02:37:50,991 --> 02:37:51,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm level 12 or 13.

2016
02:37:52,072 --> 02:37:55,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a little bit of an ordeal to get my game.

2017
02:37:59,056 --> 02:38:00,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazon screwed up the shipment.

2018
02:38:01,537 --> 02:38:03,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you notice there's a lot of people in that right now?

2019
02:38:05,139 --> 02:38:07,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting knocked off every once in a while.

2020
02:38:07,461 --> 02:38:07,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

2021
02:38:08,221 --> 02:38:09,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, having some connection issues.

2022
02:38:09,982 --> 02:38:16,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's my end here or just that everybody happens to be on the Crysis server or not.

2023
02:38:18,623 --> 02:38:22,146
[SPEAKER_07]: How much patching did you have to do that first day?

2024
02:38:22,586 --> 02:38:24,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the first day I had about 11 gig download.

2025
02:38:24,808 --> 02:38:25,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

2026
02:38:26,689 --> 02:38:27,229
[SPEAKER_07]: 11 gigs?

2027
02:38:27,550 --> 02:38:28,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It seemed like it.

2028
02:38:28,530 --> 02:38:30,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It took a long time.

2029
02:38:31,753 --> 02:38:32,874
[SPEAKER_07]: That is crazy.

2030
02:38:32,974 --> 02:38:33,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2031
02:38:33,414 --> 02:38:35,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how is it playing an MMO on the PS3?

2032
02:38:35,436 --> 02:38:40,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think MMOs can work on the PS3 now that this, you know, big... Because I think this is kind of the first one.

2033
02:38:40,900 --> 02:38:42,180
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was APB, I guess.

2034
02:38:42,241 --> 02:38:44,702
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is really, you know, one of the first big ones.

2035
02:38:44,742 --> 02:38:45,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's out.

2036
02:38:45,996 --> 02:38:50,278
[SPEAKER_11]: If they can make it this kind of a control scheme, it could probably work.

2037
02:38:50,418 --> 02:38:53,320
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty nice.

2038
02:38:54,740 --> 02:39:01,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you able to talk to other people okay, or do you kind of not need to do that in your experiences with DC Universe Online?

2039
02:39:01,383 --> 02:39:02,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, do you use a keyboard?

2040
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:04,265
[SPEAKER_11]: You can.

2041
02:39:04,765 --> 02:39:10,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I went out and got the keypad for the PS3 controller, but...

2042
02:39:12,043 --> 02:39:15,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently you can do some chat, but it's a little weird to get it set up and working right.

2043
02:39:16,826 --> 02:39:18,326
[SPEAKER_11]: You can just use your Bluetooth headset.

2044
02:39:19,107 --> 02:39:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you find that the text, you can actually read it?

2045
02:39:21,128 --> 02:39:26,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Because one of the complaints I've heard about the PS3 version is that the text is very small on HDTV.

2046
02:39:26,611 --> 02:39:28,192
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a little small, but I've got a...

2047
02:39:29,278 --> 02:39:29,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2048
02:39:50,111 --> 02:39:56,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you like City of Heroes, that kind of stuff, it's definitely worth checking out.

2049
02:39:57,157 --> 02:39:57,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2050
02:39:57,717 --> 02:40:01,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I might have to check this out, but gosh, games are so expensive these days.

2051
02:40:02,121 --> 02:40:04,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And I already have one MMO I'm subscribed to.

2052
02:40:04,063 --> 02:40:06,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need $30 a month to play MMOs.

2053
02:40:07,025 --> 02:40:09,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you can get a good one now.

2054
02:40:10,608 --> 02:40:10,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2055
02:40:11,048 --> 02:40:11,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I see what you did there.

2056
02:40:12,202 --> 02:40:14,883
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Brad, we've got to let you go, but do you have any other thoughts for us?

2057
02:40:15,564 --> 02:40:16,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, nope.

2058
02:40:16,244 --> 02:40:18,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep on doing what you're doing, and we'll keep listening.

2059
02:40:18,866 --> 02:40:19,786
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you so much.

2060
02:40:19,806 --> 02:40:20,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And check out Brad's show.

2061
02:40:20,847 --> 02:40:23,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It's PodCulture, available at podculture.net.

2062
02:40:23,628 --> 02:40:24,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I right?

2063
02:40:24,488 --> 02:40:29,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Podculture.net and soon-to-be podculture.com, because we are switching over to a new host.

2064
02:40:29,471 --> 02:40:30,812
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be an indie show again.

2065
02:40:31,332 --> 02:40:31,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2066
02:40:31,973 --> 02:40:32,273
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2067
02:40:32,293 --> 02:40:34,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, welcome to the indie realm, I suppose.

2068
02:40:35,257 --> 02:40:40,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can, of course, always look him up on iTunes, which is kind of the king of podcasts there.

2069
02:40:40,964 --> 02:40:41,204
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2070
02:40:41,224 --> 02:40:41,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

2071
02:40:42,205 --> 02:40:42,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Later, guys.

2072
02:40:42,746 --> 02:40:43,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2073
02:40:44,068 --> 02:40:44,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to hear from Brad.

2074
02:40:44,869 --> 02:40:46,811
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a very long time we've heard from Brad.

2075
02:40:47,051 --> 02:40:50,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So glad to hear he's back in the gaming with whatever brought him back there.

2076
02:40:51,276 --> 02:40:53,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We can probably do at least one more call here.

2077
02:40:53,398 --> 02:40:57,042
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2078
02:40:57,462 --> 02:40:59,985
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to at least about one more call here before we wrap it up.

2079
02:41:00,025 --> 02:41:01,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other last minute stories?

2080
02:41:03,548 --> 02:41:05,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I do have some.

2081
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:06,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

2082
02:41:09,025 --> 02:41:09,605
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2083
02:41:35,236 --> 02:41:50,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Going out, getting boxes, packing up my Nintendo games, calling them, getting the prices, packing it up, sending to them, waiting about a week and a half, getting some brand new Nintendo games and playing them for hours upon hours.

2084
02:41:51,261 --> 02:41:55,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's how I got my copy of Ultima 3 Exodus on the NES was through Funkoland.

2085
02:41:57,573 --> 02:42:05,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember playing Renegade a long time ago and I remembered that game sometime later and I started getting my hands on that and I believe Dragon Warrior 3.

2086
02:42:08,438 --> 02:42:13,780
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my thing because it got to the point where I couldn't afford to get all the games I wanted.

2087
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:15,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I had all these stacks of games.

2088
02:42:15,421 --> 02:42:17,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well do something with it.

2089
02:42:17,262 --> 02:42:20,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I find out there's a Funko Land.

2090
02:42:20,083 --> 02:42:25,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during my junior high and high school years, that was my hangout spot.

2091
02:42:25,685 --> 02:42:27,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go there all the time.

2092
02:42:27,466 --> 02:42:29,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a lot of friends and stuff like that.

2093
02:42:29,546 --> 02:42:29,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And then...

2094
02:42:31,067 --> 02:42:56,188
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually I stopped going because half the managers got sent to different stores and the newer managers are assholes so I was like there's no point in going and then one day I just happened to roll in there and I go to the front counter and I'm like can I get a price sheet and they're like oh we don't do price sheets anymore and you have to go to the back of the line and I turn around I see this long line of people and I said the hell with this and I walked out

2095
02:43:00,690 --> 02:43:03,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there a GameStop where that Funkoland used to sit?

2096
02:43:05,915 --> 02:43:08,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really is.

2097
02:43:08,858 --> 02:43:20,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I used to live, one of my best friends from high school, he finally told me about six months or so ago, they finally turned the software and our old shopping center into a Funkoland.

2098
02:43:24,184 --> 02:43:24,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2099
02:43:25,627 --> 02:43:25,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2100
02:43:26,328 --> 02:43:29,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it would take like 15 years for him to change the logo on the front.

2101
02:43:32,415 --> 02:43:35,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, there's a store in, where was it that we were at?

2102
02:43:35,858 --> 02:43:37,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Oregon, and we were in what?

2103
02:43:37,619 --> 02:43:38,400
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Software Etc.

2104
02:43:38,460 --> 02:43:39,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Ashland?

2105
02:43:39,241 --> 02:43:39,842
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Medford.

2106
02:43:40,122 --> 02:43:40,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2107
02:43:40,482 --> 02:43:41,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the city right north of Ashland, right?

2108
02:43:41,783 --> 02:43:43,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we went inside, it was a GameStop.

2109
02:43:43,405 --> 02:43:44,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a GameStop.

2110
02:43:44,306 --> 02:43:48,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But they had the white neon Software Etc., and it was like it was 1993 again.

2111
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:52,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, and I had to buy a game there, because I'm like, dude, it's Software Etc., I gotta buy a game here.

2112
02:43:52,133 --> 02:43:54,135
[SPEAKER_07]: But even the receipt on it said GameStop.

2113
02:43:55,336 --> 02:43:59,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't bother because I'm anti-GameStop in the first place.

2114
02:44:08,976 --> 02:44:10,197
[SPEAKER_07]: You're anti the man.

2115
02:44:10,677 --> 02:44:11,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Stick it to the man.

2116
02:44:12,138 --> 02:44:12,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2117
02:44:12,778 --> 02:44:13,899
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it once, I'll say it again.

2118
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:15,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck GameStop.

2119
02:44:15,659 --> 02:44:16,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2120
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:18,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, on that note, we're gonna let you go, buddy.

2121
02:44:18,941 --> 02:44:19,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

2122
02:44:19,701 --> 02:44:20,422
[SPEAKER_07]: But have a good one.

2123
02:44:20,902 --> 02:44:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

2124
02:44:21,402 --> 02:44:21,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2125
02:44:21,983 --> 02:44:28,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Reminiscing about the good old days with DJ Ranma S. Any other last minute stories, Loki?

2126
02:44:30,803 --> 02:44:31,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a couple things.

2127
02:44:31,543 --> 02:44:32,564
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually kind of funny.

2128
02:44:33,045 --> 02:44:41,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Earth Defense Force 2, the new one that's coming out on PSP, they're actually selling it in a two-pack in Japan.

2129
02:44:42,233 --> 02:44:43,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a double enlistment pack.

2130
02:44:43,874 --> 02:44:49,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It contains two UMD copies of the game in their full packaging, bundled together for 6,279 yen versus...

2131
02:44:55,965 --> 02:44:57,386
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

2132
02:45:26,957 --> 02:45:28,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Bobby, how are you?

2133
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:29,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good.

2134
02:45:30,001 --> 02:45:31,043
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys have a good show tonight.

2135
02:45:31,423 --> 02:45:32,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm having a good time.

2136
02:45:32,805 --> 02:45:34,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've had a good time listening.

2137
02:45:34,247 --> 02:45:41,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you always have us on at the end of your show, so I'm always happy when you're able to get in amongst the Skype madness and be on the end of our show.

2138
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:43,170
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2139
02:45:43,250 --> 02:45:48,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I want everybody to vote against Poppin' and Parapara and DDR, which got a buy.

2140
02:45:48,855 --> 02:45:49,756
[SPEAKER_10]: How did that even get in there?

2141
02:45:49,956 --> 02:45:52,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Because too many people put it up towards the top of their list.

2142
02:45:52,478 --> 02:46:02,586
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to remember, our station started as a museum, so a lot of the people... And bless them for sticking with us through all these years, the thick and thin and some of the tough decisions we've made, but we do have a lot of fans of that.

2143
02:46:02,987 --> 02:46:07,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, USL has their listenership as well, but I know a lot of it is crossover.

2144
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:07,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2145
02:46:08,411 --> 02:46:12,995
[SPEAKER_07]: The show, in some ways, was a spin-off of USL, so we have many listeners from back in that day.

2146
02:46:14,296 --> 02:46:16,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to say that, you know, I'm like you.

2147
02:46:16,177 --> 02:46:20,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't be mad if Final Fantasy VI won, as long as Super Metroid doesn't win.

2148
02:46:21,141 --> 02:46:21,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hater.

2149
02:46:21,882 --> 02:46:22,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you hating?

2150
02:46:22,582 --> 02:46:23,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you hating on Super Metroid?

2151
02:46:24,184 --> 02:46:24,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sucks.

2152
02:46:25,785 --> 02:46:26,886
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not suck.

2153
02:46:27,286 --> 02:46:29,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the most amazing video game ever made.

2154
02:46:29,448 --> 02:46:30,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you hating on Super Metroid?

2155
02:46:31,370 --> 02:46:33,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Super Metroid mimics a vacuum.

2156
02:46:35,253 --> 02:46:35,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

2157
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:39,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it sad that I actually had to stop and think about that one for it?

2158
02:46:39,962 --> 02:46:41,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, you don't play in a vacuum.

2159
02:46:41,243 --> 02:46:42,845
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

2160
02:46:43,245 --> 02:46:43,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you Bobby.

2161
02:46:44,466 --> 02:46:45,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Curse you, Bobby.

2162
02:46:46,869 --> 02:46:49,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, you just launched a new website for your show, right?

2163
02:46:49,931 --> 02:46:50,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

2164
02:46:50,352 --> 02:46:52,654
[SPEAKER_10]: BobbyBlackWolf.com and the podcast is back.

2165
02:46:52,894 --> 02:46:53,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2166
02:46:53,355 --> 02:46:57,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Your podcast feed is more up to date than ours, but that will all change this week.

2167
02:46:57,518 --> 02:46:57,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

2168
02:46:58,299 --> 02:47:00,781
[SPEAKER_10]: My episode from tonight already on the podcast feed.

2169
02:47:00,841 --> 02:47:01,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2170
02:47:01,682 --> 02:47:02,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

2171
02:47:03,165 --> 02:47:04,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That hasn't happened in three years.

2172
02:47:04,987 --> 02:47:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Good gosh.

2173
02:47:07,068 --> 02:47:10,110
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to cancel doing second shows more often or something.

2174
02:47:10,691 --> 02:47:11,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

2175
02:47:11,371 --> 02:47:16,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And I reviewed the Telltale game Back to the Future on my show, so people can go check that out.

2176
02:47:17,257 --> 02:47:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we have to go check it out to see what you really think.

2177
02:47:19,318 --> 02:47:24,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was going to say, and I forgot to mention this on the call earlier, I'm really looking forward to the Jurassic Park game.

2178
02:47:24,300 --> 02:47:30,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why, but I think it's because I liked the books when I was younger, and I remember seeing the original movies, except three.

2179
02:47:30,542 --> 02:47:31,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Who bothered with three?

2180
02:47:31,683 --> 02:47:41,186
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm kind of excited to revisit those, because it's been a long time since those movies were out, and that whole stuff was big.

2181
02:47:41,966 --> 02:47:43,227
[SPEAKER_07]: They never did make a fourth movie.

2182
02:47:43,247 --> 02:47:46,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they're ever going to, but it would be kind of fun to revisit that world, I think.

2183
02:47:47,259 --> 02:47:56,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and one of the things is when Heavy Rain came out, I even said I would love to play a Telltale game like Sam & Max using the Heavy Rain style of controls.

2184
02:47:57,622 --> 02:48:05,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And now that's what they're going to be doing for Jurassic Park is doing more Heavy Rain type stuff than just point and click adventures.

2185
02:48:05,924 --> 02:48:10,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully if it works for Jurassic Park, they'll do that in Sam & Max and probably add some of that.

2186
02:48:10,874 --> 02:48:14,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason

2187
02:48:36,923 --> 02:48:37,403
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR.

2188
02:48:38,024 --> 02:48:38,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote against it next week.

2189
02:48:38,925 --> 02:48:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll deal with it.

2190
02:48:40,046 --> 02:48:43,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Every gamer has a voice, even when they're wrong, like you are.

2191
02:48:43,889 --> 02:48:49,073
[SPEAKER_06]: All I gotta say is the next, was it Poker Night at the Inventory or whatever?

2192
02:48:49,113 --> 02:48:50,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be awesome.

2193
02:48:51,035 --> 02:48:54,978
[SPEAKER_06]: With, you know, was it Christopher Lloyd and a T-Rex?

2194
02:48:55,038 --> 02:48:56,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And a Velociraptor.

2195
02:48:59,039 --> 02:49:00,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all Jason.

2196
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:02,260
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2197
02:49:03,361 --> 02:49:04,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, thanks so much for your call.

2198
02:49:04,781 --> 02:49:05,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

2199
02:49:05,722 --> 02:49:06,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2200
02:49:06,242 --> 02:49:06,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2201
02:49:07,362 --> 02:49:10,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us.

2202
02:49:10,283 --> 02:49:13,544
[SPEAKER_09]: You go all in on the next Poker Night at the Inventory and the Velociraptor.

2203
02:49:14,005 --> 02:49:14,605
[SPEAKER_09]: He's so pissed.

2204
02:49:14,625 --> 02:49:16,806
[SPEAKER_09]: He just eats Strong Bad violently, gruesomely.

2205
02:49:16,826 --> 02:49:17,966
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

2206
02:49:18,986 --> 02:49:19,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Snaps him in half.

2207
02:49:20,267 --> 02:49:20,587
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2208
02:49:20,907 --> 02:49:23,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other last minute stories before we wrap up the show tonight?

2209
02:49:23,248 --> 02:49:23,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a few.

2210
02:49:24,308 --> 02:49:27,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Minecraft has sold a million copies, which is pretty awesome.

2211
02:49:27,409 --> 02:49:27,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Grats.

2212
02:49:28,129 --> 02:49:32,790
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new update for that as well that adds... I still haven't played it.

2213
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:33,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I a bad gamer?

2214
02:49:34,050 --> 02:49:35,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really played it either.

2215
02:49:35,331 --> 02:49:36,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a bad gamer.

2216
02:49:36,291 --> 02:49:37,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded it.

2217
02:49:37,131 --> 02:49:38,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I haven't played it.

2218
02:49:39,992 --> 02:49:40,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2219
02:49:41,292 --> 02:49:45,153
[SPEAKER_06]: They added some new recipes including squids and cake.

2220
02:49:47,745 --> 02:49:48,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2221
02:49:48,365 --> 02:49:48,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2222
02:50:05,181 --> 02:50:06,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else.

2223
02:50:06,882 --> 02:50:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Remedy is bringing Death Rally for the iPhone.

2224
02:50:11,843 --> 02:50:17,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Rally you may remember as an old Apogee game back from 1996.

2225
02:50:18,805 --> 02:50:23,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a top-down combat racing game, which is kind of cool.

2226
02:50:24,494 --> 02:50:33,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, speaking of iOS, the iPad has a bunch of ridiculous peripherals that were being shown off at CES.

2227
02:50:33,621 --> 02:50:40,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, one of these is the iCade, which transforms your iPad into an arcade.

2228
02:50:40,847 --> 02:50:42,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get that at ThinkGeek for $100.

2229
02:50:43,349 --> 02:50:49,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, if you don't want to spend $100, but you still want some sort of tactile controller, they have a stick-on...

2230
02:50:51,295 --> 02:50:57,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Joystick actually for $25 and it just sticks onto your iPad.

2231
02:50:57,320 --> 02:50:58,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Apple should release one.

2232
02:50:59,701 --> 02:51:00,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should.

2233
02:51:00,822 --> 02:51:10,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I think they should have something that the iPhone or whatever plugs into or hell, if they wanted to do Bluetooth support for controllers or something, that'd be awesome.

2234
02:51:11,490 --> 02:51:12,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what the people want.

2235
02:51:12,976 --> 02:51:16,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that Verizon has their iPhone, they're just going to sell even more of them.

2236
02:51:16,179 --> 02:51:21,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like if they were to release just a little controller that plugs into the bottom of those phones, I tell you, it's over.

2237
02:51:22,946 --> 02:51:23,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2238
02:51:26,072 --> 02:51:26,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

2239
02:51:26,773 --> 02:51:27,153
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2240
02:51:44,528 --> 02:52:13,154
[SPEAKER_07]: so please help us spread the word about our show leave us a nice review on iTunes we could always use those we haven't had any five star reviews in a while so if you have an iTunes account please consider leaving us one there and you know just tell a friend or two about the show we would really really appreciate it we can't finish up the show though until we go around and get everybody's final thought so Salacious Pop I'll start with you thank you for filling in tonight stepping up to the plate I know you didn't get a lot of notice on that so I appreciate you doing that for us my pleasure and do you have a final thought for us tonight

2241
02:52:16,576 --> 02:52:17,337
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm good.

2242
02:52:18,177 --> 02:52:19,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Vietnamese noodles after this.

2243
02:52:19,298 --> 02:52:20,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

2244
02:52:20,299 --> 02:52:21,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had blood orange pinkberry.

2245
02:52:22,220 --> 02:52:24,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Blood orange pinkberry is the best thing ever.

2246
02:52:24,162 --> 02:52:24,782
[SPEAKER_07]: So good.

2247
02:52:24,842 --> 02:52:25,823
[SPEAKER_07]: That is my final thought.

2248
02:52:25,863 --> 02:52:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Blood orange pinkberry.

2249
02:52:27,124 --> 02:52:29,826
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a pinkberry anywhere near you, you must go have the blood orange pinkberry.

2250
02:52:29,906 --> 02:52:31,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had better yogurt in my life.

2251
02:52:32,027 --> 02:52:32,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It is great.

2252
02:52:33,128 --> 02:52:34,409
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to keep that as a permanent flavor.

2253
02:52:34,449 --> 02:52:35,550
[SPEAKER_07]: If they get rid of that, I'm going to be pissed.

2254
02:52:35,910 --> 02:52:36,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2255
02:52:37,271 --> 02:52:38,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about food again.

2256
02:52:38,452 --> 02:52:38,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Uber noms.

2257
02:52:39,312 --> 02:52:40,533
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2258
02:52:41,854 --> 02:52:42,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a lot of beer today.

2259
02:52:44,008 --> 02:52:44,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

2260
02:52:45,170 --> 02:52:46,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, your final thought tonight?

2261
02:52:47,553 --> 02:52:51,578
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is this Aliens game looks weird.

2262
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:56,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that whole square one that was designed back in the day?

2263
02:52:56,785 --> 02:53:02,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like, I don't know, like a side-scrolling Metal Gear or something kind of interesting.

2264
02:53:02,918 --> 02:53:04,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's going to do it.

2265
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:05,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys again.

2266
02:53:05,402 --> 02:53:06,303
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week.

2267
02:53:06,363 --> 02:53:12,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back here to do it all again next week, and we hope you'll join us live at allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

2268
02:53:12,653 --> 02:53:16,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you can always stay tuned on our podcast feed, which, yes, will be updated.

2269
02:53:16,098 --> 02:53:17,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry I was so naughty.

2270
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:18,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for...

2271
02:53:19,229 --> 02:53:20,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for still standing by us.

2272
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:21,151
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

2273
02:53:21,331 --> 02:53:21,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

2274
02:53:48,252 --> 02:53:50,294
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're probably right anyway.

2275
02:53:50,835 --> 02:53:51,676
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week!
