1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,020
Tonight, June 26, 2011, could the 360 see free to play games?

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,180
Xbox brings Kinect functionality to advertisements, and can Silent Hill be scary without Pyramid

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,680
Head?

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet once again, and welcome back to another week

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,520
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,440
co-hosts as I have joined with them for the past nine freaking years.

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,120
Say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura, Jamie Sowers.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,520
Who let you in my house?

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,280
That's right, I did.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,240
How are you?

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm recovering.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Recovering from?

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Sinus infection.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Oh, I was going to say.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,560
Remember I had a sinus infection last week.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,440
I was going to say it's Pride weekend, so maybe you were recovering from-

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
I'm recovering from the gay.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
All right.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,040
Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki, who is setting up something

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
tech right now.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
What are you doing over there?

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,680
You're like getting your, his Xbox.

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
He's hooking up the Bloom Box.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,840
His Orlando Bloom autographed Xbox.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Why?

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Because he could.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Yes.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
For no good reason.

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
What are you going to play on there?

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Are you playing Child of Eden again?

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
I don't know.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
I haven't decided yet.

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
He's just hooking up.

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
He just wants to play.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Galgun.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
He just wants to play games.

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Galgun.

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
I don't want to play Galgun.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
We have special guests joining us tonight.

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Of course, as always, you guys in chat.

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Chat.orangelandre.com.

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,560
You join us live and we read your comments here.

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,980
It is a show where every gamer has a voice.

45
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,640
We will have the phone lines open later despite that little tease I gave on Bobby's show

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
beforehand.

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
We will have the phone lines open later.

48
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,880
And of course, Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Email bag, mailbag, orangelandre.com.

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
They get it all?

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Someone didn't put it on the show roll.

51
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Whatever.

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
It's not there?

53
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
No.

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Oh, well, we are doing the mailbag at some point.

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,520
When is a mystery to everybody?

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,040
Anyhow, let's introduce the guests we have here in studio.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,460
We have some blast from the past here to celebrate nine years of O-L-R with us.

58
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,240
As mentioned on Bobby's show, when you have your 100th episode, your 200th episode, your

59
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,440
five-year episode, you kind of run out of, like, the ego stroking gets a little old.

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,520
But we thought, what better way to mark nine years of O-L-R than to invite somebody who's

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
on a show that's even older.

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,520
So say hello to the one and only Jessica Harper is here tonight.

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,280
I thought you were going to say, you know, when you're talking about ego stroking, who

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
better than Jessica Harper?

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
Is that another word for it?

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
How are you, Jessica?

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,920
I'm doing just fine.

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Welcome.

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,400
This is, you know, some of the dinner people from back in the day of Maundy Days know you

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,920
as Iguana Girl, the queen bee of DDR Freak for quite some time.

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Exactly, yeah.

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
The queen bitch.

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,320
But we got all the DDR Freak gossip, you know, a few months ago when you were on the show

74
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
last.

75
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,160
So I don't know how much of that we want to revisit.

76
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
We'll see how much wine we get in yet.

77
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
Yeah, I know.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,000
That's pretty much, but I have to make sure I don't have too much.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
But of course, you're here tonight to help plug the Under Sedation Live 10-year anniversary

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
show is coming up.

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
It's coming up on July 16th.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,120
We will have 10 years and we'll be sealing Rob away for that night.

83
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,960
So he'll have to have the fun of doing two shows in one week.

84
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,860
Because as you guys may or may not know, I was doing Under Sedation Live back when it

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,480
first started back then.

86
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,920
It was before OLR.

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,480
OLR was a spinoff of Under Sedation Live in some ways, you know, in some ways, just like

88
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,560
DDR Freak Radio, which again, another blast from the house right there, was a spinoff

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,460
of Under Sedation Live.

90
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,600
So we all kind of formed our own stations based off of that station.

91
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,560
Yes, we all hatched out of that egg and somehow we all came out looking like Lady Gaga, our

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
respective shows.

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,180
I came out looking more like Rudall, but I don't know.

94
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,560
Complete with the CGI face on the very odd, all right, anyhow.

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,720
As long as you make sure I'm wearing an octopus and have, you know, a big, huge building on

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
my head, I'm all good.

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,880
Wait, are you going for the Ursula look with the octopus?

98
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,200
Exactly, in the building, you know, I have to have the large building.

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,560
Which by the way, can I just random tangent?

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I was at Disneyland.

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,360
I had to go without Alan because, you know, it was just finances being what they were.

102
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,200
But there's two things that Alan loves.

103
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,480
He loves Hello Kitty and he loves Ursula.

104
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
And you know what I was able to find at Build-A-Bear?

105
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Hello Kitty Ursula?

106
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,440
A Hello Kitty and I put an Ursula costume on it.

107
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,800
There you go.

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
And it's the best thing ever.

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,400
Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
That was awesome.

111
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
All right.

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
We will talk video games, I promise.

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, and her name is Divine.

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Yeah, her name is Divine.

115
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Anyhow.

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
It's more appropriate.

117
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
We'll talk video games in a moment.

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,440
But I have to introduce another blast from the past.

119
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:49,240
And this is somebody who wasn't on Under Sedation Live, but he was on many, many, many early

120
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
episodes of Orange Law and Tradeo.

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
And then he disappeared.

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,960
But now he's back.

123
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
Say hello everybody to the one and only Intern Drew is back tonight.

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Hey, what's up?

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
You can't keep me away from this place for long.

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,440
And still having a little bit of wine right now.

127
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,560
And it's going to affect me far more than it will Jessica.

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,560
This is creeping me out because back when the 23rd Magus was on the show back in the

129
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,960
day, you weren't old enough to drink.

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
I was 17.

131
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Oh my God.

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm so old.

133
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,580
And now I feel old.

134
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,360
But I've been here for nine years.

135
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,960
He was also shut up with all of that right about now.

136
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,480
He was also our resident young Republican.

137
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,160
From the two females in the room, can we both say shut up?

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,960
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

139
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,880
And now I'm this is reminding me of my first show because once again, it's actually it's

140
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,320
it's Loki that has the pizza this time.

141
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,480
And I'm the closest to the floor.

142
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,200
So yeah, feeling old and moldy right now.

143
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,000
This reminds me of the first show too because I had a migraine that day.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
Just wait for it to be hot in here.

145
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,640
I know it's gonna get hot with all these and the AC is on.

146
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,840
We can turn up the fans on the window open now and we'll figure it out.

147
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
All right.

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,600
So guys, once again, if you want to join us in our chat room chat about orange lounge

149
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,880
radio dot com, you can join us.

150
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,200
And yeah, join in the party and comment on the shows.

151
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Break Man starts us off saying he left and comes back and is still an intern.

152
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Lol.

153
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Absolutely.

154
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,800
Because as long as he's an intern, we don't have to pay him as she 100.

155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
Matt says, Oh, God, hide your soundboard tables.

156
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,960
That is one of the highlights, I guess you could say, of our history was the night the

157
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
23rd Magus.

158
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,280
I'm going to call him that all night long because it's retro, broke the soundboard.

159
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
Well, he didn't really break the soundboard, but he, what'd you do?

160
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,520
You leaned up against the card table that soundboard was on and the whole damn thing

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
just collapsed and we wouldn't get legs knocked off.

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,260
Yeah, we went dead for a good 30 seconds and all the chatters are like, Oh, the stream

163
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
went down.

164
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,260
I don't get it.

165
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
I'm still connected.

166
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,260
You broke the show.

167
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Yeah.

168
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
And then it turned out drew broke the show.

169
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,120
They could see that was back when we had the webcam, Justin TV cam and I would hide on

170
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
the couch.

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
That's right.

172
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,320
And we had to be on cam and it was, it was better set up there.

173
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,320
So we had the Justin TV cam back then and the, everybody could see what was happening

174
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,140
on the Justin TV cam, but they couldn't hear it.

175
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,560
So it was funny.

176
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Anyhow.

177
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,600
You know what?

178
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,080
We should actually, we don't have that footage cause we could totally redo it as a silent

179
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
picture.

180
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,620
So eat gads, the table has fallen.

181
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,880
So this week on orangelaunchradio.com, our website, Dark Tetsuya, who bless, bless his

182
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
heart.

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,320
He's like the only person that's actually writing content for the site right now.

184
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,720
And I know I'm thinking I need to make a new year's resolution.

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,420
I'm saying a new year of OLRs resolution actually write content for the website because it's

186
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,520
it's we need to get more people visiting orange launch radio.com and posting on our forums

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
and stuff.

188
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,920
And I think a lot of that comes with content, but a dark Tetsuya had a lot of fun reading

189
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,320
the blast from the past that were on there this week, the where are they now series that

190
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,760
he was doing where, you know, a lot of, a lot of people, and I get not everybody listening

191
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,840
to the podcast now would get it quote unquote, because by the time we were actually in iTunes

192
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,980
as a podcast, we had moved on from being just a show about dance dance revolution and beat

193
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,200
media to DX and the tournament scene and so, so forth and all of that.

194
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,960
So I get a lot of people didn't really follow the scene in those days, but it was kind of

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,640
fun to read about what's happened to a lot of those people.

196
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,380
Of course, you can't mention the money culture without get it, stop it.

197
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,000
But one of the people that was interviewed was Jessica, and you can read her article

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,240
up on there and see what she's been up to, or she'll just tell us about it tonight.

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,560
It's not like it was that much more than you guys already know.

200
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Yeah.

201
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,160
I think actually the last time I was here, you got a heck of a lot more juicy stuff than

202
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,080
you ever possibly could on me.

203
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, I know one thing you've done since the last time you were on the show is you actually

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,280
went to the place where we all used to hang out.

205
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,360
You went to Roseville Golf Land, which over the years we've called the place where video

206
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,760
games go to die because we've slowly watched this arcade that used to be like our, our

207
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,160
turf, so to speak, just slowly morph into gambling machines for children that spit out

208
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
tickets.

209
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Yeah.

210
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
And nothing else.

211
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,120
And what did you feel walking into Roseville Golf Land and just kind of seeing it now?

212
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
I wanted to cry.

213
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Did you?

214
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
I really did.

215
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,680
It was just pathetic.

216
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,960
You walk in and it previously, one of the only reasons why I would still even go there

217
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:18,120
was because there, there was a 2DX machine for a period of time there, it's gone.

218
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,040
There's still two DDR machines.

219
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,720
They're now in a back corner, tucked away where people like to walk over the pads even

220
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,560
more so than they did when they were prominently displayed towards the middle.

221
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,360
And keep in mind, Roseville Golf Land is also a water park.

222
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,400
So a lot of times during the summer that will be wet feet walking over electronic machines.

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Exactly.

224
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Genius people out in Roseville.

225
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,720
Or playing on the machines with their wet feet and leaving all of their water behind.

226
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,400
The only machines that are there, you have an extreme machine.

227
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm sorry, Max2 and Disney's Rave.

228
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,040
And that's it for DDR.

229
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,320
And Drummania, there's no drumsticks.

230
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:07,120
There's a stool that's attached by a big, huge metal chain so that you can't move it.

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,080
And the Guitar Freaks controllers were upside down and on the floor when I looked at it.

232
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,040
But oh, of course, they had to have newer style machines.

233
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Everything else was okay.

234
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,120
Plus a big, huge Tetris machine, which I don't understand.

235
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
I played that.

236
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Yeah.

237
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
That thing's frightening.

238
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
And hard to control.

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
Wait, Tetris is back in the arcade?

240
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
What?

241
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
It's a huge mungus.

242
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
It's a big ball.

243
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
What?

244
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I took a picture of it.

245
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
The controller's a big ball.

246
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Hold on, let me find my picture of it because I took a picture.

247
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,280
It's a Tetris game that's a giant ball.

248
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,840
Each controller is a huge ball and the screen is like twice my height.

249
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Yeah.

250
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,320
And there's a button on each side of the ball and to move things, you have to move the ball

251
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
around with your hands.

252
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,000
It's awkward Tetris.

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Awkward Tetris.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's exactly...

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, it really is.

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's awkward.

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's hard to play too.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Awkward, phallic Tetris.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
With about half the size of the normal amount of lines or actually a third of the amount

261
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
of lines that you would normally have.

262
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,440
And it's still kind of hard to get any at all because it's like, oh, you want it here?

263
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,680
Well, we're going to move you one block over because it does not center.

264
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Yeah.

265
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,160
We've got some comments in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com.

266
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Let's see.

267
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,680
SSGA 100 Matt says, every golf land is like that though.

268
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,840
Yeah, but every golf land is not in Roseville and Roseville is a special place because everyone

269
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
there is privileged.

270
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Yeah.

271
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,020
Keep in mind that all of these horrible things that are happening to the arcade are complete

272
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,600
opposite as to what's happening to every other portion of the golf land sun splash experience.

273
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,520
You have sun splash, which just keeps on growing and they keep getting more rides.

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:47,560
And now there's this giant two level parking garage area so that everybody and their little

275
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
brother can park.

276
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,400
I do appreciate the fact that they have more parking because it was annoying having the

277
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,480
park like in and out in order to make it to sun splash.

278
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
You had to hike in.

279
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
During summertime, yeah.

280
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes.

281
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
The rest of the year was no problem.

282
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
No.

283
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Here it is.

284
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,280
And see, that's the thing too is they forget, hey, you know, it does get cool at some point

285
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,640
and you can't ride the, you know, slides.

286
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,120
Hey, it's a Sega game.

287
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,240
It's Tetris by Sega.

288
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
That's kind of neat.

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,120
It's Tetris giant.

290
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Interesting.

291
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,120
And there's the ball and the ball is seriously like the size of my head.

292
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,360
Also in our chat room, uh, chat.orangewonnage.com, the Rob D says, ski ball is also bring your

293
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,520
own ski balls.

294
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,800
Actually, I did play around a ski ball last time I was at our vehicle and you know how

295
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
like a bunch of balls are supposed to come down like nine balls, but if the machine is

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,440
short and it only give like three balls and then it'll keep refilling.

297
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
I had two.

298
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Yeah.

299
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,840
So I had to literally wait after I would throw two balls for, I did play a ski ball while

300
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I was there.

301
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Okay.

302
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,520
Um, the one on the very far left, it would shoot out a bunch of tickets at you, but then

303
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,400
if you, it didn't matter what you scored, there would be no more tickets that would

304
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
come out.

305
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,800
Whereas any of the other ones would give you like three initial tickets and then it was

306
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,300
based on score from that point on.

307
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,400
So if you really want, you know, unless you were really, really good at ski ball, you

308
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,760
always want to go to the one on the left because it shoots out something insane like 18 tickets.

309
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,240
Orange Lounge Radio giving you the pro tips.

310
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Exactly.

311
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,420
Well, and the whole reason why I ended up resorting to the little kiddie gambling games

312
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,480
is because I had this card that had something to the tune of about a hundred credits on

313
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
it.

314
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
And that's right.

315
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
They went through the card system.

316
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,680
That's how long it's been since I've gone there.

317
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480
I think I have tokens still.

318
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah, I think at one point in time I tossed a $20 bill on to get a card so that I could

319
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,320
play 2DX and I played for like an hour that one day and went, oh, I'll just go ahead and

320
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,520
save this card and bring it back for next time.

321
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,400
And this was the next time.

322
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,640
Speaking of which, Rob, do you remember, uh, remember I was going to Dave and Buster's

323
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,080
like the first year we went to E3?

324
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm still using that damn card.

325
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,800
Like I don't go there ever.

326
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,720
And I had like, I had to go for the two for one arcade night or whatever it's called.

327
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,840
Um, yes, 23 Maggots.

328
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Stop doing that.

329
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
All right.

330
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Drew Nami, intern Drew, whatever.

331
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,560
I, I, I, I grew up, dammit.

332
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,640
I swear to God I grew up just not much.

333
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,640
No, I still have my, uh, my Dave and Buster's card from when I went there the first time

334
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,920
for one of Jamie's birthdays.

335
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,200
Yay.

336
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,560
Like back in the day when I used to go every year.

337
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Yeah.

338
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,760
Back in the day where I still couldn't have a drink.

339
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
Oh.

340
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,440
So before we get into our gaming weeks, which is how we're usually supposed to start off

341
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
the show, but you know, it's a birthday show.

342
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Just deal.

343
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,920
Uh, I want to talk, cause we were talking about turf and how the Rosewood Golf needs

344
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
to be our turf.

345
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,960
But I got to tell you one of my favorite just memories of the past nine years when it comes

346
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:44,240
to when arcades are actually fun and that would be as ghetto fuck as it is, Scandia

347
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Family Fun Entertainment Center, because I'm just going to say it, we own that fucking

348
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,840
joint for a short period of time.

349
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh yeah, we did fucking, that was our turf.

350
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,120
The whole reason is, you know, when you get friendly, when you befriend the game tech,

351
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,880
the game tech manager, then you own everything and that was the only reason why we had such

352
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,360
a good time at Roseville after a while was because he got moved over there and started

353
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
working over there.

354
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,340
We're like, Hey, you know, could you put a good word in for the Milwaukee games for us?

355
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,720
But nowhere was it more apparent that we fucking owned Scandia than, than that tournament that

356
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
we had there.

357
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,400
The two tournaments, I don't even remember.

358
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
We did March Madness.

359
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Okay.

360
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,760
I want to see the other one, which is normally a barrier tournament.

361
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm telling you, we monopolized the birthday party room with our room where we were deep

362
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,680
frying Twinkies and selling them.

363
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Why?

364
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,720
Because we know because it sounded funny because Justin B thought it would be a good idea.

365
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,960
The hell ever happened to that kid?

366
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
I don't know.

367
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,520
He doesn't use, I think he like remixes remixing stuff.

368
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,000
So we need to get him to one of the songs, one cage match once.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah.

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,280
And don't forget that for shaft, the pad broke.

371
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
I do.

372
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
I do remember that.

373
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,640
And I had to run back home and go get my hard mounted soft pads.

374
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,640
If that tells you how old school this is, kids, there was no such thing as a cobalt

375
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
flux back then.

376
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
It's hard.

377
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Yeah.

378
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,880
It was my custom hard mounted soft pads that we ended up using for one of the routines

379
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
for the competition.

380
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Good times.

381
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,000
I beat my first nine footer on those pads.

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Me too, actually.

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,480
Or no, my second, I think my second, I think my second was on those pads.

384
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I beat my first nine footer.

385
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,280
But, um, yeah, I mean, and then I remember there was the little gazebo that was out there

386
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,900
before you could go out to the golf course and just, it was all the, you know, Bay area

387
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,480
DER people just took over that place and like families are trying to come in there and stuff

388
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,240
and we get scared off by the conversation that was going on.

389
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,560
I mean, it's just, we, we re we ruled the school there.

390
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
It was awesome.

391
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm pulling out with random tunic tunic tunes and yes, except for the batting cages, those

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we didn't touch.

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,320
And then you remember like all the bad things that happened to that place, like the time

394
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,160
that they took it to the best of Sacramento or something like that and the speakers fell

395
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:06,080
off or the marquee fell off of the thing and they put like boombox speakers up there or

396
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
something.

397
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,560
Although I do remember that we, we had the donated subwoofer for 2DX that would vibrate

398
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
your knees.

399
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes.

400
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,800
That was awesome.

401
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,920
It was great too, is that, um, because we knew the arcade tax, uh, a DDR fourth mix

402
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
machine would load edits that you made at home.

403
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,320
You could actually save a limited number of edits on the machine and he used, he would

404
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
load our edits.

405
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,680
And I remember we had, uh, I, or at least I don't know if me or you, we had an edit

406
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,680
for kick the can called big cans, all it was so, so you could fire up big cans and you'd

407
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,600
see it on the machine now playing big cans.

408
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,440
And what it was is that it would start for like, you know, the song started with this

409
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
fun little dance for like four measures and it was just a giant break in the song.

410
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,160
So people would literally start big cans, play the first four measures, run a lap around

411
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:04,820
the entire arcade and get back just in time to hit that last don't remember that the hell

412
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,840
at it competitions too, which I've won lots of good porn that way.

413
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,680
Make it, make it and get porn.

414
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Yeah, it was awesome.

415
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
That was one of the, that was one of the early things on OLR.

416
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,280
I remember someone, someone passed my hell at it, my DXYM hell at it.

417
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,400
That was, it was that skinny kid, Dave.

418
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
He won.

419
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Sign and beat it.

420
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
He won.

421
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,880
When we went on the moderator trip for DDR freak back when sign and beat it, I bought

422
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,720
him dinner and we, we, we can't forget the awesomeness that was a chaff that was a Wendell's

423
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,000
famous roast beef routine.

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,220
Yes.

425
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,900
And we of course can't forget the travesty that was my attempt at freestyle, which we

426
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,640
shall never hear of again.

427
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
God damn it.

428
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,360
Wasn't that the first time I ever did my Dr. Dick character too?

429
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Yes.

430
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,080
Imagine me doing drag, but not doing drag, that was my Dr. Dick character that I would

431
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
do.

432
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,760
Didn't Dr. Dick eventually though turn into Mr. Spanky?

433
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
On the, on OLR.

434
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
So OLR is the spiritual successor to all of that.

435
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,920
Like Rob, but gayer.

436
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Anyway.

437
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
All right.

438
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Look, we got to get into...

439
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
There's gayer than Rob?

440
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Hey.

441
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
All right.

442
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
We got to get into...

443
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Oh girl.

444
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm sorry.

445
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,540
That's still supposed to come in a couple of weeks.

446
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,440
That's when I get to start attacking you again.

447
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,840
I can't wait.

448
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I guess I have to play nice.

449
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
This is a warm up.

450
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Warm up.

451
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Oh boy.

452
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Oh no, no.

453
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
You can continue.

454
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
I'm enjoying it.

455
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I'll just sit back here and go, writing this down.

456
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
He's like crap.

457
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,940
Now I remember what it was like.

458
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,480
So if you think our reminiscing tonight is bad over nine years ago and everything we

459
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
were doing back then, just wait until next year because I'm telling you, we're renting

460
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,880
the Masonic Lodge or something and we're just gonna, we're gonna rule the school and get

461
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,360
everybody in one place.

462
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,480
Get out all the DDR pads, have like an OLR con or something.

463
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
That's my dream for a 10th anniversary thing.

464
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,480
And get everybody in one roof and just blow the roof off the place.

465
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Be fun.

466
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Good times.

467
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
This is our awesome sack anime panel that we did.

468
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

469
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Eight in the morning.

470
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
About three years ago.

471
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,960
Oh, that was so, I think I like had like a double coffee.

472
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Literally two people showed up.

473
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Yeah, you and one other kid.

474
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
But you know what I got out of that whole thing?

475
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
My Dalek.

476
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
All right.

477
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,680
I have that on reserve for you, Jamie.

478
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Let's move on guys.

479
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,600
Let's get into your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.

480
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,440
Nine years later, what are the console games or PC games making up your week?

481
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Dark soccer.

482
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Wow.

483
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Damn it.

484
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,920
But I'm actually going to be getting myself a month card for Star Trek online so that

485
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,120
my Scottish fleet mates will not keep harassing me.

486
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Are they missing you?

487
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
They miss me.

488
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Well, okay.

489
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,720
One of my fleet mates is on my Facebook and he's such a nice guy.

490
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,040
He's actually the first person that I met in game there that I chatted with other than

491
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,880
someone who was actually role playing Captain Jack Harkness from Torchwood, which was gorgeous.

492
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,400
But we, we, we just ended up chatting and we were the same level and we kept playing

493
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,760
and then he got me into the fleet and I was like, Ooh, I get to listen to Scottish men's.

494
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
That's awesome.

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,600
So I might be getting a month on STO before the fun's going to dry.

496
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
All right.

497
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,680
So thinking about more MMOs to go play.

498
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Initial D extreme stage.

499
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,260
We're going to have news later on tonight about a pretty big MMO that is going free

500
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,460
to play.

501
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,960
So I'm curious if that's going to be something you're going to want to go to as well.

502
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,160
It'd be interesting to see just free MMOs are good.

503
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Except for Ragnarok online, which I played for what, nine years in various forms of,

504
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,300
well, when I started playing, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

505
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,620
When I started playing, I started on the Korean beta.

506
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,980
So I was playing on the Korean servers for free because it was in beta.

507
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,080
And then I played on the Japanese servers when they kicked us out of the Korean servers.

508
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,600
And then I played on the American servers when we finally got them.

509
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,980
And I played all the way up until it went pay to play.

510
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,840
And then I actually started paying for it.

511
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,800
And then I went to private servers because the mods were jerk faces and would do random

512
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,080
attacks on the towns.

513
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Yeah.

514
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
I remember that.

515
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
You dragged my ass into it.

516
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I couldn't leave town.

517
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Yeah.

518
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
You can't leave town because you'll just...

519
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Oh, dead.

520
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Oh, because it was Halloween.

521
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Ooh.

522
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Oop, dead.

523
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
That's fun.

524
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Walk alone.

525
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,800
And then the whole thing is like, oh, you're walking alone.

526
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Oop, dead.

527
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
We're putting a random mob there.

528
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Yeah.

529
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
How about no?

530
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Yeah.

531
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
So no more RO for me.

532
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
All right.

533
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Well, let's go over...

534
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Oh.

535
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
One more thing.

536
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Okay.

537
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,000
Lots of peggle in WoW.

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Because I've been sitting my ass in queue for 35 minutes a pop because I like DPS too

539
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
much.

540
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Done.

541
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
All right.

542
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Loki, how was your gaming week?

543
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
It was okay.

544
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I didn't play a whole lot this week.

545
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,600
I played, let's see, some more Child of Eden, which is, it's pretty awesome.

546
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,080
I actually got to play it on the HGTV this time.

547
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,700
It does get quite difficult when you're using the controller, like about even like the third

548
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,840
level in or whatever.

549
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,080
So I'm actually looking forward to trying it with the Kinect.

550
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,640
I think it'll be a lot more accurate.

551
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,080
Played a bit of Shadows of the Damned, which is a very strange game.

552
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,120
And there's lots of penis references all throughout the game.

553
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,440
Just the entire fucking game is just penis references.

554
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
But it's cool.

555
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,960
Where can I buy this game?

556
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
At your local store.

557
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
It's basically Suda51.

558
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,140
I mean, well, there you go.

559
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
That's why.

560
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
It's all crazy.

561
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:38,560
Suda51, the guy that created Resident Evil, and Akira Yamaoka doing the soundtrack.

562
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,840
It's pretty awesome, though.

563
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,320
It's kind of a third person action game where your girlfriend gets, you're a demon hunter

564
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,720
and your girlfriend gets killed.

565
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,360
And basically this demon lord takes her into hell and you have to go after him.

566
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,200
And they're calling it a road, was it like a road trip movie in hell.

567
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,520
We actually have a clip from the game.

568
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,600
This is Shadows of the Damned.

569
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,960
This is a clip actually from the Akira Yamaoka soundtrack.

570
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,400
I know a lot of you have been eagerly anticipating hearing some of the soundtrack.

571
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Here you go.

572
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,840
Gentlemen, here's a little number I tossed off recently in the Caribbean.

573
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?

574
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,480
Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong?

575
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
It's swell to have a stiffy.

576
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,320
It's divine to own a dick.

577
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,000
From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick.

578
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,560
So three cheers for your Willie or John Thomas.

579
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,120
Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake, your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your

580
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,280
pussy or your cock, you can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock, but

581
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,440
don't take it out in public or they will stick you in the dock and you won't.

582
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Come back.

583
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,160
Thank you very much.

584
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
There you go.

585
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
That's Akira Yamaoka.

586
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
It's a weird direction he's going in now with his music.

587
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,400
You know what, Rob?

588
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,880
I used to, it was me and a bunch of my friends would go to the one Denny's in Mobile, Alabama

589
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,480
and sing this as loud as we could around 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock after we were done doing

590
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,240
whatever it was that we little degenerates were doing, you know, like there's shit to

591
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,080
do in Mobile, Alabama.

592
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,240
Except play live action vampire.

593
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
LARP.

594
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
LARP.

595
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,400
Naturally you pick the Denny's because that shit will get you kicked out of Waffle House.

596
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,600
Yeah, that will get you kicked out of Waffle House.

597
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:32,600
You laugh at that rendition of that song there, but actually your gun, which is Johnson, yes,

598
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,560
he keeps referring to as Johnson the entire time, actually the voice is very similar.

599
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:44,360
All right, so you've been playing Penis of the Damned and what, two penises up or?

600
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
It's awesome.

601
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
It's a pretty fun game.

602
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,600
I'm actually looking forward to, no, I'm never going to finish this game.

603
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
You know why?

604
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Because Earth Defense Force.

605
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,680
So, Insect Armageddon is going to be coming out, not next week, but the week after.

606
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,640
But hey, you know what, I don't know if I can get it early.

607
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,680
And that's all I'll be playing at the end of this next week.

608
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,240
So I don't care about finishing this game or anything else because this game will take

609
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
over my life.

610
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Great.

611
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,920
So when we ask you about your gaming week for the next six months, it's going to be,

612
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,080
ah, I played Insect Armageddon.

613
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,020
What if, what if, what if, what if it sucks?

614
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
It's going to suck.

615
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,720
The first game sucked, but it was fun.

616
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
That was the whole point.

617
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,480
Rob, let's just give you the complete view of that game right away.

618
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,240
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.

619
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
There.

620
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
That's your review.

621
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Thank you.

622
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Somebody, somebody crop me a sound clip of that.

623
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
There's actually, um.

624
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
When he moves.

625
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
There's some weird shit in there.

626
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,800
Like, for example, you go, you have to shoot goat heads in order to get light to show,

627
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,960
um, show up.

628
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,240
And also, uh, there's these baby faces.

629
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,800
You have to feed giant strawberries and eyeballs too.

630
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,520
Oh, fun.

631
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,720
I want this game.

632
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
It's pretty awesome.

633
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
All right.

634
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,560
Uh, I believe your husband will have it soon.

635
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Really?

636
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Wow.

637
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
You're a profit.

638
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,280
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

639
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,120
Uh, Grand Theft Auto.

640
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
All right.

641
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,040
Almost, almost made it a whole week where I was just on a winning streak the entire

642
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
week.

643
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,800
I did lose one game in the middle of there and I was out today, so I'll try next week.

644
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I know.

645
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,400
It's, it's, it's this, sorry, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.

646
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,980
Uh, this is this, this is like bubble wrap.

647
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,720
It's like the world's biggest bubble wrap, but you can't pop the bubbles.

648
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,400
So I keep sitting here trying to pop the bubbles on this world's biggest bubble wrap and they

649
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,320
don't, they don't pop just don't, if you rip into it, that's cheating.

650
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,760
You can't use your nails.

651
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,520
I could pop it, but I'm all right.

652
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,840
I don't want to ruin that piece of any house that can ruin that piece of bubble wrap.

653
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
This is great radio.

654
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,520
The sound of no, no, no, no, no, that's cheating.

655
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
That is cheating with scissors.

656
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
All right.

657
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
My house.

658
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
I can cheat.

659
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Can you picture that and put it on the website?

660
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,760
So at least there's some, all you would have had to do is just roll it up into a ball and

661
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
it would have worked.

662
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't see why twisting it would be cheating though.

663
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,960
All right, Jessica, I know you don't, Oh my gosh, she got one.

664
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
That's what I said.

665
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
You twist it.

666
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Wow.

667
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,880
All right, Jessica, I know you don't just play DDR.

668
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I play DDR.

669
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,800
You know why I won't do?

670
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,220
Because look at it, it's not just one bubble.

671
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
It's multi-bubble.

672
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,960
Enough with the bubble wrap.

673
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
We're playing, you know, a game right now.

674
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,920
I was trying to understand the physics behind it, Rob.

675
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Don't you ever watch Mr. Wizard's World?

676
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Don't you ever want to know?

677
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
He's dead, Jamie.

678
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
And he hated children.

679
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:30,200
Anyway, Jessica, how was your gaming week?

680
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,900
I played what I always play, lots and lots and lots of lotro and lots and lots of lotro

681
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
and more lotro.

682
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,920
Dude, what is it with chicks and MMOs?

683
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Okay, dealer.

684
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,720
It's funny you guys were talking about the whole, you know, free MMO thing because lotro

685
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,880
is a free MMO, though I am a subscriber.

686
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,220
And I think it was a good thing for them to do because they brought in a lot of people

687
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,280
and it was because of bringing in those people that they gained more of an audience for their

688
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
subscriptions.

689
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
So.

690
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:08,840
Out of curiosity, when lotro went free to play, did a lot of the existing fan base say,

691
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,320
we're going to reject these free people and this is going to be horrible and we don't

692
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,560
want new people coming into our turf?

693
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,320
Like was it received with a bunch of negativity?

694
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,360
Well, I wasn't on at that point in time.

695
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,000
I came in a little bit after that, but I did, I do hear even to this day, oh, well, everything

696
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,880
changed when we went free to play, you know, the types of people that were playing now

697
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,280
are completely different and so hard to, you know, and I can understand that, you know,

698
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,800
you're going to end up with a lot more of a crowd that is flaky.

699
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,440
If people have their money, you know, put into a game, then yeah, they're a little bit

700
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,000
more indebted to, they're going to, they're going to play it more often.

701
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,840
Just makes sense.

702
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,480
That said, I too have a Star Trek online account that I pay for monthly that just sits there

703
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,440
with my level 10 Lieutenant Commander.

704
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,840
So it's, you know, it doesn't really matter all the time.

705
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,400
You're still going to have the same type of flaky people.

706
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,940
It's I don't know.

707
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,160
It's topical because it's something else going on this week.

708
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
That's why I asked.

709
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,600
But the main thing is we're getting ready right now for Isengard is going to be the

710
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,000
next update in September.

711
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,340
So everybody's doing their pre-purchase and you get your snazzy stuff, like your snazzy

712
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,840
horse or your snazzy outfit and everything.

713
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,960
But the one thing I like is I get a 25% XP buff on any of my characters that are below

714
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,540
the level cap.

715
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,640
And for me, who's right there, just barely below the level cap, that helps gives me that

716
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
little extra push.

717
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Awesome.

718
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,680
Will that bring you up?

719
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Huh?

720
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Will that bring you up to the level?

721
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,880
Well, no, I'm still working on it.

722
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,720
It's just a 25% extra buff so that you're gaining 25% more XP per kill.

723
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,200
Plus on top of it, we're in the middle of the summer festival.

724
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,700
So you automatically are getting a buff from that as well on XP.

725
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:00,240
So any kills that I've made this weekend are basically just, I'm getting mad, mad XP from.

726
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Cool.

727
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,960
Let me ask this because Lord of the Rings really isn't big in pop culture right now.

728
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,340
I mean, it was a few years ago when the movies were coming out, but obviously it's always

729
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,760
going to have its fan base.

730
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,440
But the reason why I say that is because we have these Hobbit movies that are on the horizon.

731
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,760
We're hearing more about that.

732
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,920
That's going to kind of bring more attention back in pop culture to the all things Lord

733
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,740
of the Rings and Tolkien and all that.

734
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,400
So how do you think the MMO will be impacted by the Hobbit?

735
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,840
Oh, I would not be surprised if you would end up seeing a huge surge of people that

736
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,160
were going to start joining after that.

737
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,200
On top of that, we're also seeing a lot of people right now because movie theaters all

738
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,160
across the country are showing the original movies on big screen one night per week.

739
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,480
So last week they did the original, now they're doing Two Towers this week, and next week's

740
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
going to be...

741
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,040
Yeah, Dan's going to that on Tuesday.

742
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Yeah.

743
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,220
So that in and of itself is getting a lot more interest.

744
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,520
So I look forward to it.

745
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:07,260
The kinship that I'm a part of is very newbie friendly and we like to be able to help each

746
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,240
other kind of move on in the game and we welcome anybody no matter if they're paid to play

747
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,760
or not in our kinship.

748
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
So yay, go Arlequins.

749
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Yay.

750
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,320
It's very warm and fuzzy and friendly.

751
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
And it helps too.

752
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,560
It helps too because not only do I have two of my old coworkers in my kinship, the leader

753
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,160
is somebody that I knew from IRC that I met like way back in the day.

754
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,840
So it's really kind of spiffy that I get to have that kind of connection with two completely

755
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,000
different portions of my life at the same time.

756
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Awesome.

757
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
MMOs, bringing people together.

758
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
There you go.

759
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
All right.

760
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,080
Drunami, anything you want to say about your gaming week and what you've been playing?

761
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,660
I've been playing a bunch of the WoW crack and not really encountering those insane queue

762
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,320
times because I play a healer.

763
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
But I can understand.

764
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
What kind of healer are you?

765
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,480
I main a priest, but I'm starting up a shaman lately.

766
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
You're a 40, right?

767
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Holy Pally's the best.

768
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Yeah.

769
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,360
I never really got into the Holy Pally stuff, but aside from that, I've been playing a lot

770
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:17,360
of Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War 2, Retribution, Electric Boogaloo over too many subtitles.

771
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,320
And speaking of games that have gone free to play or have been free to play for a while,

772
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,120
Steam kind of kicked off some stuff and I kind of got into making a Champions Online

773
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,560
character trying to get into the whole Silver Age thing.

774
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm like, yeah, I heard Champions Online kind of tepid, like a lot of people weren't really

775
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
into it when it first came out.

776
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,960
Then it went free to play and suddenly way more people were into it.

777
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I was in the beta.

778
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
It got better.

779
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
It got better.

780
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Not great, but it got better.

781
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,320
But I started up a grimoire named 23.

782
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Derp.

783
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Numerologist.

784
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Yay.

785
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,760
And a lot of people too with that game forget that they were going to put that on 360 and

786
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,200
then at the last minute, it just didn't end up happening.

787
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,480
But it's funny because if you plug in an Xbox 360, Alan told me about this, you plug in

788
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,800
a 360 controller, it will show.

789
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
It works.

790
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,920
Yeah, everything shows up with the Xbox buttons and everything.

791
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,720
But not very well.

792
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
I tried.

793
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,760
I actually had to struggle to get it not to recognize 360 control and let me use the damn

794
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,080
keyboard because I have my controller plugged in all the time.

795
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,280
But aside from that, you know, wow, Dawn of War, Champions Online, I haven't really been

796
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
playing much.

797
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,600
I've been thinking about getting back into playing some Wii games I'd set on the shelf.

798
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,120
Playing through No More Heroes 2 again.

799
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,400
And just kind of going through my game archive stuff I hadn't finished.

800
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Rogue Galaxy.

801
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,480
That's what I'm doing right now.

802
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,520
Shadow Hearts from the New World.

803
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,640
Just some older PS2 stuff because I'm a broke ass like that.

804
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
Alright.

805
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,960
Well, there you go.

806
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,720
Lots of archive gaming and free gaming.

807
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,800
Yeah, also scaring the crap out of myself with Dead Space but that's another story altogether.

808
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,840
Let's see, my gaming week quickly and then we'll get into the gaming news.

809
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,600
I actually don't have a lot to add to my gaming week this week.

810
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,340
It's really the same games.

811
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,920
It's funny because I've been gaming a lot but I have nothing new to share with you all

812
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,120
because I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 13.

813
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,200
I'm finally to the point where the game has opened up and if you've played through 13

814
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,920
you know exactly what point of the game I'm talking about.

815
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,960
You know, that took many, many hours to get there but I'm actually really into it and

816
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,260
again, I don't get the 13 hate.

817
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,600
This is seriously one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.

818
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,680
I like it more Nate, that's for sure.

819
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,400
So I'm having a great time with it.

820
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,440
So I am going to play it through to completion.

821
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:37,500
That is because even though yes, some of the characters are just so cliche and annoying,

822
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,920
I really, really have a boner for Fang who is an amazing character.

823
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Love her.

824
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,160
So, strong woman.

825
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Like her.

826
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,600
I'm like, I'm just playing for Fang at this point.

827
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
She's great.

828
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
And I like lightning too.

829
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,160
Is that Fang service?

830
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Yes.

831
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,040
It's Fang service.

832
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,000
I see Drunami is rubbing off on you.

833
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
All right.

834
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Anyhow.

835
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He's sitting next to me.

836
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm getting infected.

837
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Anyhow.

838
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Also, you know, Warcraft.

839
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,720
Mortal Kombat played online for a little bit with Extrofer from the other show Horde House.

840
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,600
I was playing, yes, he's really getting into Mortal Kombat.

841
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
It's really funny.

842
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,440
Like he's almost beat story mode, I think.

843
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
So we were sparring a little bit.

844
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,640
So that was fun because I like playing with Extrofer because like I know who it is and

845
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,720
it's not just some anonymous face who is kicking my ass.

846
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,440
But Extrofer and I are pretty evenly matched.

847
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,060
So it's actually kind of fun to play him online.

848
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,360
So I'm thankful to like no more people playing Mortal Kombat online.

849
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,000
So otherwise, nothing really new to share.

850
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,400
Hopefully in the coming weeks I will.

851
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,000
I actually have some racing games sitting at home that came from my rental service that

852
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm waiting to play.

853
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,280
So I'm hoping I'll have a Need for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited 2 things to say in the

854
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,600
coming weeks because I have both of those sitting at home.

855
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,200
I want to know who the fuck Penis Man is.

856
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,180
Again, one of those sound clips I'd like to save to a sound board and use on a rainy day

857
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
sometime.

858
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,040
Chat.orangelandre.com if you would like to offend Dark Soccer with your name.

859
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,760
It's Break Man.

860
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Anyhow, let's move on to, we're going to get into gaming news, but first some housekeeping

861
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
tonight.

862
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Good lord, it's been nine years.

863
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,000
If you haven't already, you really should follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R

864
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,600
and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

865
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,680
And yeah, please join us on those sites.

866
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,280
And of course, I want to plug one more time, Jess Carper is here tonight to help plug Under

867
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,740
Sedation Live, which is the show that was before Orange Lounge Radio, it was actually

868
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
on that show.

869
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,680
That was a show born of the Rocky Horror community.

870
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,760
I don't think a lot of people know that.

871
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,520
But that was a show, like this was born of DDR, that show was born of Rocky Horror and

872
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,880
now it's kind of all things sci-fi geekery what the fuck every plus video games tossed

873
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
in there too.

874
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Yes.

875
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Plus, and then video games tossed in there too.

876
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,560
So and of course, under station lives on Saturday nights at eight o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock

877
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Eastern.

878
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
So it's a late show.

879
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
Yes.

880
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
And the website.

881
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,600
It's understationlive.org and Travis actually just revamped the entire website this week.

882
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,020
And on top of that, he just updated all of the podcasts.

883
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:12,880
So now everything is up there, up to week before last.

884
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,600
He didn't do last week's because it was a solo show because I was out and about.

885
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,960
So yeah, basically everything through episode 36 is up on the web.

886
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Great.

887
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Because I need to catch up because, you know, it's tough.

888
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,480
With having this show on Sunday night, Saturday night, it's usually my night to, you know,

889
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
go do stuff.

890
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,640
Oh, you will definitely want to, I think 35 or 36.

891
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Definitely.

892
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
All right.

893
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,080
So we're doing some pre-ten year anniversary reminiscing.

894
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Oh boy.

895
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
All right.

896
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
All right.

897
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
I'll have to check that out.

898
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
And then of course the 10 year anniversary show is July 16th.

899
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Right?

900
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Yes.

901
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
All right.

902
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Did you kidnap a child?

903
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Okay.

904
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
All right.

905
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,840
Anyhow, let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.

906
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,380
Loki.

907
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:05,160
So Monday, this is coming up Monday, there's going to be some stuff going down in California.

908
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,840
The case Brown versus EMA, which is formerly Schwarzenegger versus EMA, involving California's

909
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:18,720
attempt to enforce a law written by, thank you, Leland Yee, a Democrat representing San

910
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,380
Francisco in 2005, that would criminalize the sale of hyper violent games to kids.

911
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,000
It's not necessarily all M rated games, but only certain types of games as defined by

912
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
the law.

913
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,800
These new games would need to be labeled specially and carry a thousand dollar fine to those

914
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,100
who are found violation of the law, selling those games to minors.

915
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,720
And it says, if the court rules for California, it will be overturning a half decades worth

916
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,480
of decisions in lower courts that said California's law violated first amendment protections of

917
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,920
freedom of speech.

918
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,000
Apparently also, it doesn't necessarily mean if the court decides that it's against the

919
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
first amendment.

920
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
It says they could still direct the state in how to write the law that would criminalize

921
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,560
the sale of games to kids without violating the constitution.

922
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
I don't know.

923
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,600
So basically, if they win, they're going to separate video games from music, movies, and

924
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,280
books and all their forms of entertainment, singling them out, preventing them from going

925
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,000
to be sold for minors and stuff like that.

926
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

927
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What?

928
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,560
Dark soccer is saying, is this more important than a Supreme court hearing on video games

929
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,120
to change the way we buy games?

930
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Yes, it is.

931
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
I'm dying to hear this.

932
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
It's cake.

933
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,400
Oh, birthday to you.

934
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,640
Happy birthday dear Rob.

935
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Happy birthday to you.

936
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Thank you guys.

937
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Yeah.

938
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
It's my birthday too.

939
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Not just the shows.

940
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I have to make a wish.

941
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Yes.

942
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Okay.

943
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm going to, Oh, do I get, do I have to say my wish or do I have to keep a secret?

944
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,440
You can tell us after the show.

945
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,920
One, two, way to blow Rob.

946
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
He sure knows how to blow.

947
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
He's gone from suck to blow.

948
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Yay.

949
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,200
I blew them all out.

950
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Yay.

951
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Thank you for not setting the cake on fire.

952
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:24,360
I appreciate that because there are not 30 candles on that cake, there's far less.

953
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,120
I'll get plates while he finishes the story.

954
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
That's told you.

955
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
All right.

956
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,360
And that's, that's not a Bel Air cake.

957
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,480
That is a homemade cake.

958
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,200
Becky's made the icing and everything from scratch.

959
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
That's great.

960
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Yeah.

961
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Thank you so much.

962
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Thank you, Becky.

963
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
All right.

964
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Isn't she sneaky?

965
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Anyhow.

966
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,080
Um, so yeah, it's, it sucks and hopefully it doesn't pass cause I mean, seriously, I,

967
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,880
there's enough reasons to hate the government in California.

968
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,120
We don't need them to be, and Leland Yee, seriously, this guy has a hard on for like

969
00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:01,760
writing terrible laws that involve, you know, protecting the children.

970
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
What douche.

971
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Chatters want a picture.

972
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Sorry.

973
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,680
I was yelling that I was relaying for the chat room that they wanted a picture.

974
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,120
You know, all, all that neutering, just all, all, all that, that, that happy just neutered

975
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
my rant.

976
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
I know.

977
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Right.

978
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,640
It's like, I wanted to say a lot of angry things, but how can I be mad?

979
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,080
Someone baked me a cake.

980
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,800
Um, but seriously, what, what the hell is this supposed to solve?

981
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Ignorant parents are still going to buy their kids and rated games and not worry about it.

982
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,080
Drew, I kind of feel like this discussion is like Pat, I mean, I'm not invalidating

983
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,920
your point, but it's like, it's kind of like, there's nothing we can do about this now.

984
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:44,800
The reality is tomorrow is a huge day because, and what I'm reminded of is other news that

985
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,240
came out, it was here this week or last week about cigarette label warnings are supposed

986
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,680
to get even bigger and like more either like the Canadian warnings now or like in Canada,

987
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,680
you buy the pack of smokes and it shows like the decayed lungs and all that stuff.

988
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,120
And it's like, okay, we get the point, God, you know, it's, it's, it's the same point

989
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,320
where both of them, what the hell is this going to change?

990
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,400
It's not, people who smoke are still going to smoke.

991
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,880
Parents who ignorantly buy, you know, buy all these, these video games for their kids

992
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,920
are still going to, and stores are already enforcing this stuff anyways.

993
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,120
I mean, all they're going to do is just add another, like a fine to this and it's just

994
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,800
going to screw people out of that.

995
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,880
And then also on top of that, the government's got to decide, okay, which ones are, you know,

996
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
really obscene.

997
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,360
And if these have seen games or whatever are marketed as such, then certain stores may

998
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,800
not carry them, you know, to keep their family friendly appearance, period, end of story

999
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
should be done the same as movies.

1000
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,080
Why can't it just mirror movies?

1001
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,640
Because that would make these are interactive, Rob.

1002
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,480
You have to understand people are playing the role of the killer instead of watching

1003
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
the killer brutally.

1004
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,280
You know, I have a hard time believing that the penis game is worse for kids than the

1005
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
human centipede.

1006
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,880
I'm sorry.

1007
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,720
Or any of the saw movies.

1008
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,800
They can't be consistent because that would actually make sense.

1009
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,960
And they lose their jobs if they actually make sense.

1010
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,240
It's all about trying to get a platform so he gets voted in or something like that.

1011
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,040
I don't even know what the point of this is.

1012
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:21,200
I it's, are they saying, are legal analysts trying to predict this one way or the other?

1013
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,920
Does anybody have a reading on how, which way this is going to go?

1014
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,360
They figured that the way that this is, this law's gone in other States, it's not going

1015
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
to pass.

1016
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,160
You know, and then here's the best thing apart.

1017
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:39,840
The best part about it is it's our tax money that the state is using to fight this thing.

1018
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,320
Thanks.

1019
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I want a refund.

1020
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,640
Uh, go into our chatroom at chat.ownerswannabe.com.

1021
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,160
Rama in our chatroom says the stores do not enforce it.

1022
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:55,640
I've seen 16 year olds buy M rated games and the cashiers just hit the bypass keys.

1023
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,160
McMahon in chat says these new cigarette warning labels make me want to smoke.

1024
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,000
Well that's not having the intended effect then.

1025
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,600
I really am.

1026
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:15,640
I think I like how they handle it in, in England where movies and games have the same reading

1027
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
system.

1028
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
I'm so with you.

1029
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I'm so with you.

1030
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,360
Just give games the exact, I mean, I guess we're kind of past the point of no return

1031
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,440
so to speak.

1032
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,440
Like we've already had this rating system that's been established in place for years.

1033
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,760
It's not that difficult to understand the rating system though.

1034
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,520
I mean, how, how much more do we need to, I mean, it's, I don't think it's necessarily

1035
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,440
that, you know, these people, um, these people don't know what the rating system is or that

1036
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
these games are violent.

1037
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,220
I think they just don't care.

1038
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,160
It's just like, oh, I don't care if I get cancer from smoking or I don't care if I,

1039
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,720
you know, get liver damage from drinking.

1040
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,340
They just don't care.

1041
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:56,320
And no amount of laws and stickers and banners and, you know, campaigns and whatever are

1042
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,960
going to get these people to care anymore.

1043
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,360
Unless you say, oh, you bought this for your child, we're going to fine you a thousand

1044
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
dollars.

1045
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,880
Then, you know, the immortal words of Bill Murray, it just doesn't matter.

1046
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,560
Or, uh, how about Dennis Leary?

1047
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
It's a drug.

1048
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,760
We're addicted.

1049
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,080
Some not very encouraging words from Black Wolf in the chat room saying, Sky, the mock

1050
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,480
trials that some law school schools have done said that the Supreme Court will side with

1051
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
California.

1052
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,200
Well, then they're dumb.

1053
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,200
I'm sorry.

1054
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Then that's sad.

1055
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,360
We're at a really sad state is if they single this out, then, then they need to fight this.

1056
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,020
They need to appeal it and they need to fight it because it's the Supreme Court, Loki.

1057
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,720
You can't appeal that it is.

1058
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,520
There is no, there is no court higher in the land than the Supreme Court period.

1059
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
I'm sorry though.

1060
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,840
But you're singling, basically you're restricting the freedom of expression because you're restricting

1061
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,920
the sale of these certain games, which have not even been proven to cause any harm to

1062
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
children anyways.

1063
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,120
The crime rate's actually decreased since the Super Nintendo came out.

1064
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,760
So there's, there's no, it's not like, you know, smoking or, that's a pretty easy distinction.

1065
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,840
You're talking about all hypothetical stuff.

1066
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,760
We don't, there's no, like playing a violent video game doesn't make me catch on fire or,

1067
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,920
you know, doesn't make my lungs deteriorate.

1068
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,080
It's just a game.

1069
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,880
Loki, welcome to America, home of unnecessary moral panic.

1070
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,000
It was like this for D&D.

1071
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,760
It was like that for Doom.

1072
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,760
It's going to continue.

1073
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,080
And how many of us who were raised on D&D are sacrificing chickens in the backyard?

1074
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
Don't check my backyard, Jamie.

1075
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
I swear to God.

1076
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Here's my thing.

1077
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,360
If, if this comes down tomorrow and it doesn't go the way we think it should, you know, the,

1078
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,660
the only way you can quote unquote retaliate is with your vote and stop voting for people

1079
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,200
that are going to shove moral righteousness down our throat.

1080
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,680
Who is voting for Lee Lin Yi?

1081
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,360
San Francisco, I blame you.

1082
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,800
This is all your damn fault.

1083
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
You and his sister?

1084
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
I thought he was SoCal.

1085
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,800
No, he's San Francisco.

1086
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
He's San Francisco.

1087
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
And guess what?

1088
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,960
You know, this is the same type of shit that they passed over there was they were banning

1089
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,760
toys from Happy Meals because that'll get people to stop buying fast food for their

1090
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,320
children.

1091
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,400
Yeah.

1092
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,800
No people not being stupid will do that.

1093
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,140
Well, San Francisco's also got the whole thing about, what is it, they want to ban circumcision

1094
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,140
or something like that.

1095
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,760
So yeah, listen, San Francisco, you're already fucking strange enough as it is, you know,

1096
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,920
you don't really, there are other things we need to legislate, but, but then you go, well,

1097
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,640
everybody that's going to, you do that, that's going to start coming into line with, um,

1098
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,280
uh, uh, with religious tolerance groups because the, um, the anti-defamation league has already

1099
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
gotten in on that.

1100
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,960
Well, and then here, but then here's the other thing on the other side of the coin.

1101
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,160
So you, you look at these things that San Francisco is doing, you kind of roll your

1102
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,500
eyes, but at the same time, everybody in San Francisco has healthcare and whether you're

1103
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,160
a fan of socialized healthcare or not, you have to admit that's quite a feat that they're

1104
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
doing it.

1105
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,460
I mean that it's happening there.

1106
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,840
Whether you're a fan of that theory or not, you got to say, wow, that is quite a political

1107
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
feat that they're doing.

1108
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Yeah.

1109
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Here's what they're doing.

1110
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
They're wasting money is what they're doing.

1111
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,600
They're wasting money by giving everybody healthcare, whether you deserve it or not.

1112
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,960
And they're also wasting money with all these fucking laws that you're trying to pass.

1113
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,440
No, we, we, they deserve help.

1114
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
All right.

1115
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
You know what?

1116
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
They're not fucking working.

1117
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
They don't deserve healthcare.

1118
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,120
You got to pitch in to get something back.

1119
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,120
You know what?

1120
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,720
What about if somebody, you know what, I will tell you this right now and you're about to

1121
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,080
get the verbal bitch slap for me.

1122
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,320
I got laid off of my job.

1123
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
I have been applying.

1124
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,320
Dan has been applying.

1125
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,240
Neither of us have insurance right now.

1126
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,120
And if he had another heart attack, what would we do?

1127
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,120
He would die.

1128
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,040
End of story because we can't afford, I understand that, but you were working at one time.

1129
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,960
So you have already contributed to society, there were a lot of people that are homeless

1130
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,480
on the street now because they lost their jobs.

1131
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,420
Their houses were foreclosed on and they have nowhere to live.

1132
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,360
We know a person personally in that circumstance.

1133
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,400
So yeah, I think before you, you know, say shit like that, please.

1134
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,400
I'm sorry.

1135
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
It's my opinion.

1136
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Okay.

1137
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
I don't care.

1138
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,920
Some of these people that are homeless, they choose to be homeless.

1139
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,840
There has been tons of studies where people have tried to help these people out and sure

1140
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,640
enough, they give them money or whatever, and they're back on the street again because

1141
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,040
they can't fend for themselves.

1142
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,720
Nine years stands for to stent in the ranks right there.

1143
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,320
Well, it's like a married couple, but I could queue up the penis song again if that's what

1144
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
we need.

1145
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,000
Let's just work towards getting our money spent on more important things like putting

1146
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,760
shrimp on treadmills.

1147
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,800
All I'm saying is that they're passing a lot of these laws.

1148
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,800
It's just wasting.

1149
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,320
Why don't you like, I don't know, work on a state budget.

1150
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
How about that?

1151
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,080
You know, cause they don't have that taken care of yet.

1152
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,160
Yeah, but that's the city and not the state.

1153
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,720
Okay, so yeah, tomorrow, big day for gamers is going to be, going to be interesting.

1154
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,720
I like cake.

1155
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,560
This cake is delit.

1156
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,040
And it's not a lie.

1157
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,440
This is legitimate cake.

1158
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,480
And it's hilarious because I used to own those very same plates.

1159
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,480
I've lost control.

1160
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,480
All right.

1161
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,480
You had control?

1162
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,960
Yeah, I never did.

1163
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,120
Hey, let's talk about the PlayStation four.

1164
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,120
That's right.

1165
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,120
PlayStation four.

1166
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
I'm going to throw up now.

1167
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,680
No, here's the deal.

1168
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,760
It was asked this week of some of the Sony higher ups, specifically Jack Trenton, who

1169
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,200
of course, he's the guy that Sony has on stage for all the oppressors and all that stuff.

1170
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,500
They asked Jack Trenton, what do you think of the Wii U?

1171
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,440
Are you feeling the pressures to develop the PlayStation four because now Nintendo has

1172
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,160
announced the Wii U and Jack Trenton said to Forbes, I didn't see anything about Nintendo's

1173
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,880
announcement that said, oh, we'd better get working on rolling out a new PlayStation here

1174
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,280
pretty soon.

1175
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,680
What we've seen from the competition is trying to add features that already exist in the

1176
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,640
PlayStation three.

1177
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,320
We've invested heavily in that and we've rolled a very heavy rock up a steep hill through

1178
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,320
the launch period.

1179
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,040
But now I think that all pays off and we've got a long run way behind it.

1180
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,360
Very interesting that they call it a steep hill and kind of admitting that it was a rough

1181
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
launch for them.

1182
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
He has a point.

1183
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,840
And the point is also, if you think about it, Nintendo has never developed HD games.

1184
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,220
I mean, they're way behind everybody else as far as putting out games that are high

1185
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,360
definition.

1186
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,360
I don't know.

1187
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,360
It sells consoles.

1188
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,600
I guess they haven't had to so far.

1189
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,640
Yeah, but you see, they'll get you only so far.

1190
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,320
Then they realize, oh, hey, people that are hardcore gamers, the ones actually purchasing

1191
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,960
games other than, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.

1192
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,500
Yeah, let's let's assume they have enough money to buy an HDTV, first of all, and then

1193
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,360
let's develop HD games.

1194
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,760
You're right, because no one has HDTVs nowadays.

1195
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Oh, my God.

1196
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,840
I'm just, where am I going to find people that own HDTVs out there?

1197
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
Ugh!

1198
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,360
Everywhere is where I'm going to find them because they sell them everywhere and people

1199
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,680
have already adopted to that and they've already adopted to new HD formats.

1200
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,960
I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.

1201
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,520
I'm still busy watching UHF and sending out newsletters on a mimeograph, sorry.

1202
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,600
I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.

1203
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,440
Well, I think also you have to look at this now.

1204
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,940
You know, we're at this point where, yeah, there's some people that still have their

1205
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,200
standard definition TVs because they haven't had an upgrade, but inevitably those TVs will

1206
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,200
fail.

1207
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,200
All TVs will fail.

1208
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,280
And there's, you can't buy a standard definition TV anymore unless it's at a garage sale or

1209
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,280
something.

1210
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,840
I mean, if you go into a Target or a Walmart, you all only have HDTVs to choose from now.

1211
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,040
And you know what's funny?

1212
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,280
I've got video game systems now that will not play on any modern television.

1213
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,920
Oh, yeah, not without some serious shopping at Radio Shack.

1214
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,040
I need to actually have a UHF capable TV.

1215
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:31,840
All right, so yeah, in a nutshell, he's basically saying, well, I don't see the need to hurry

1216
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,800
up and develop the PlayStation 4, because it looks to me like Nintendo's just trying

1217
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,760
to get up to the level of the PlayStation 3.

1218
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Bitch slap.

1219
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,760
Well, and also...

1220
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,680
Funny for the ones that were a little late to the party with Move and Shut, shit like

1221
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,680
that.

1222
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,680
Yeah.

1223
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,200
And also, to their point, I mean, they're on the 10-year life cycle or whatever, so

1224
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,320
they're not going to kind of deviate from that.

1225
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,320
And I don't think you're going to see the same thing happening with Microsoft either,

1226
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,680
because they're confident that the Kinect is going to drive the console for the next

1227
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,640
five years or whatever.

1228
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:06,200
And Nintendo really, sales are dipping, and no one really gives a crap about...

1229
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,640
There's going to be the people that will buy every fucking Mario game that comes out, Mario

1230
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,600
Kart game and Animal Crossing game, even if it's just slightly different than the last

1231
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,680
one, because they're suckers for that kind of stuff.

1232
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,920
Now at the same time, though, they need to get with it, because a standard definition

1233
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,440
console isn't going to cut it when, say, the next console generation rolls around, and

1234
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,400
they're going to be playing some catch up when the next generation comes around, even

1235
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,100
though it is going to be able to push a little bit better graphics than the 360 is, but they

1236
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,440
have to know how to use it.

1237
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,560
Now the third party developers probably won't have a problem with that, because they're

1238
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:50,820
used to developing HD games, but Nintendo themselves, I think you're going to see them

1239
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,480
struggling trying to figure out how to utilize this console, and I think they're going to

1240
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,040
go more the gimmicky route, where cartoon graphics and shit with the touch screen.

1241
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,200
Yeah, they tend to be a little more agile as far as console concepts, but the technology

1242
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,080
just lags a little bit behind.

1243
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,200
Not that it doesn't sell, but it sells to a different crowd.

1244
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,080
Well one other Sony tidbit for you guys before I get to a story from Dark Sakura, but you

1245
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,200
know, of course, one of the big selling points, speaking of touch screens, on the Vita is

1246
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,480
not just the touch screen, but the rear touch panel, the reach around panel, if you will.

1247
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:27,620
In an interview with Famitsu Magazine, Suhei Yoshida, who's the president of World Wide

1248
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:34,940
Studios for Sony, said that the reach around panel almost was not on the final design because

1249
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,680
of cost.

1250
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,640
Sony was not sure that it would really impact the gameplay, and maybe it's not worthy of

1251
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,200
the sticker price.

1252
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,880
They say once people actually got their hands on it, that it became a must-have feature.

1253
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,920
Some small elements of the Vita's design are still subject to change, so we'll see what

1254
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,680
happens.

1255
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,760
But the reach around panel will still be there.

1256
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,800
I imagine when they say other things are subject to change, they're talking about what, like

1257
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,440
button positioning, or maybe the memory inside, or whatever, some of the chips that make the

1258
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,480
thing work, that all can still change.

1259
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,720
So we'll see what happens.

1260
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,320
It's probably not going to change very much, seeing as it's only a few months away.

1261
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,400
Yeah, maybe slight configuration things, but I can't...

1262
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,600
It will come in white.

1263
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Yeah, exactly.

1264
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,440
It will come in different colors.

1265
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
So we'll see.

1266
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,580
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

1267
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:30,880
We have some other news that is, well, it's Wii-related, Wii.

1268
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,180
How bad do you want Xenoblade for Wii?

1269
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,960
How many people want it?

1270
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,360
Well, apart from that, there's also the last story, Pandora's Tower.

1271
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:47,520
Those are the set right there that actually people are asking to have released outside

1272
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,240
of Japan and Europe.

1273
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,640
So we're hoping that Nintendo can bring it to the US.

1274
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,960
Let me guess, there's online petitions and things of that sort?

1275
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,160
There's letter writing.

1276
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:07,920
They're actually, basically, there's a bunch of stuff that's gone out from the IGN forums

1277
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,400
asking Nintendo to put out the games.

1278
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,120
So they're actually looking for physical letters to be sent in to Nintendo.

1279
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,280
Because that works so well for Mother 3.

1280
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,280
Yeah, exactly.

1281
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
I was just thinking the same thing.

1282
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,760
It's just earthbound all over again.

1283
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,320
You know, it is a little strange that they didn't, you know, with especially as big of

1284
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,360
a game as the last story, it just jumps out at me out of those three with what an epic,

1285
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,360
epic game it was supposed to be, or is, I guess you could say, in Japan.

1286
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,560
It's really surprising to me they didn't come out and say anything about it at E3, that

1287
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,640
this game was on its way.

1288
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,280
Is it maybe something they're keeping in their hat for if Wii U gets delayed?

1289
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,760
Well, there's more though.

1290
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,480
Xenoblade was at E3 under a different name.

1291
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:55,040
And they actually flat out asked Reggie about the titles and he just went, oh, look, Pony.

1292
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,360
I'm sorry, that's not a Mario game.

1293
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

1294
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,640
Take it from a Tales of fan, this shit never works.

1295
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,920
This petitioning never, ever works.

1296
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,620
Well, it might work if you can get a million people to sign it.

1297
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,620
Not even.

1298
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,660
If they want to screw a particular audience, they will.

1299
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,840
You know what I think?

1300
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,680
And this is what I think for a lot of the big import titles, or, you know, the big Japan-only

1301
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,120
releases that we want to see in America.

1302
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:30,800
Do it like they handled the remastered Macross DVDs, where you have a price set for if we

1303
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,840
have this many pre-orders, the game will be this price.

1304
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,140
And we'll do it.

1305
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,000
This is what it's going to cost plus standard profit margin.

1306
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,840
And then we get more pre-orders to this level, the price goes down.

1307
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
We get more orders to this level, the price goes down.

1308
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,640
So kind of a kickstart thing.

1309
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,820
Since we're reminiscing about the past a lot tonight, it reminds me of what Konami did

1310
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,120
for BeatMania 2DX7 style when that finally came out on home consoles, is that they basically

1311
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,420
said if we can get 10,000 people to pre-order the game, we'll make it.

1312
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,960
And it just, it amazes me to this day that they got away with something like that.

1313
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,480
Because you're like, you're putting down a full pre-order on a game, you don't even know

1314
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,640
it's going to happen or not.

1315
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,640
So it's kind of weird.

1316
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,320
But if they say they're not going to do it, then they have to refund the money.

1317
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Yeah, I know that.

1318
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,560
But it's still weird that so many people are willing to kind of put down the money up front

1319
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
on a maybe.

1320
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,560
You know what I mean?

1321
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,560
It's just crazy.

1322
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,560
And the fans will do stuff.

1323
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,920
Well that, I mean, but you notice I brought up the, uh, the, uh, Macross box set?

1324
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,920
They did that.

1325
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,200
It actually worked.

1326
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,800
And the price went down for, like, a full series box set to something way low.

1327
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,540
Just throw it away.

1328
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:44,080
And you know, if they do this, I'm going to put this up, because...

1329
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,480
That's his middle finger, folks, because it's not a TV show.

1330
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,040
Uh, yeah, because, I'm sorry, it's, it's stupid.

1331
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,440
Why make all your fans of your system jump through hoops to get a game put out over here?

1332
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,420
You either do it because you want to put it out, or you don't do it.

1333
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,880
Don't make people beg for it.

1334
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,080
I mean...

1335
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
The bottom line.

1336
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
Money.

1337
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,600
It's all back to money.

1338
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
It's a company.

1339
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
They need to make a profit.

1340
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,560
And the Wii is not selling software right now.

1341
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,320
And remember, it's all about ease of getting these games out.

1342
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,800
It's a lot easier for them to take a GameCube game, pretty the graphics up a little bit,

1343
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:23,760
and port it back out, and call it like a anniversary collection or some bullshit like that.

1344
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,080
And then charge, you know, 50 bucks, and then people will, you know, totally eat it up,

1345
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,080
or...

1346
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,080
I didn't say Roger.

1347
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,080
Thank you.

1348
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Roger.

1349
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,080
Apparently now Rob is called Roger.

1350
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,240
It's all right, I'll take it.

1351
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,000
Thank you.

1352
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,440
Or they can, you know, spend the money.

1353
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,540
It's going to take to localize a game that's pretty awesome.

1354
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,240
They're not going to do that, because localizing a game is going to take a lot of time.

1355
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,600
You know, what I think the best bet would be is to get that game pitched to some companies,

1356
01:00:51,600 --> 01:01:02,120
say for example like, you know, Tomo, or UFO Interactive, or Ignition, or you know, Axis

1357
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Game Localization.

1358
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,560
You know, those companies that basically all they do now, in fact, I don't know if it's

1359
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,680
one of the stories in the show role, but Ignition stopped making their own first party, or their

1360
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,160
own games.

1361
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:18,040
They had a game that they developed, El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron, but now they're

1362
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,960
just saying, listen, we're just going to take properties that are over in Japan, just bring

1363
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,880
them over instead of making our own shit.

1364
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,680
So that's who you need to, you know, pitch that game to, is one of those companies.

1365
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,640
Sounds like they're going to be the next Working Designs.

1366
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,900
And they will basically do it for you.

1367
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,580
Of course, after they get done with President Cat, because they haven't started on President

1368
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,840
Cat yet, and so we don't have that yet.

1369
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
That's right.

1370
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,040
You can't have the last story until we get President Cat.

1371
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,840
That's just the way it's going to be.

1372
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
President Cat.

1373
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,840
All right.

1374
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Moving on.

1375
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,460
Loki, what do you got for us?

1376
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,440
So free-to-play, it's something that I believe when Nintendo was asked about it, they said,

1377
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,240
nope, we have no plans on putting anything free on our marketplace, you bastards.

1378
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,240
Well, at least as far as free-to-play MMOs or something like that.

1379
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:11,480
Well, Microsoft's actually kind of feeling out with developers to see if they can, you

1380
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,880
know, get some free-to-play games.

1381
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,600
And I guess they're now contacting studios, discussing the possibility of free-to-play

1382
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,960
games, and you know, building some sort of infrastructure for the 360 that incorporates

1383
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,360
microtransactions.

1384
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,480
Because they were like, Free Realms is so awesome on the PlayStation 3, and we want

1385
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,360
a game on Xbox where you can play as a fairy.

1386
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,560
I don't think that they're necessarily doing that, but I think that they see the profit

1387
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:42,400
that like, say, like, you know, Farmville or the Smurfs Village stuff, you know, that

1388
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:51,880
makes a lot of money, and people, some people are looking for that kind of thing, so maybe?

1389
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,080
Would you be interested in free-to-play games on the Xbox, Loki?

1390
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
No.

1391
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,080
No?

1392
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,080
Why not?

1393
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,080
Just because the quality is less, or?

1394
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,720
It's usually not my, you know, the type of games that I want to play.

1395
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,840
If it was like a free-to-play grant that thought of MMO or something, that's a little different.

1396
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:14,600
I'd at least check it out, like, you know, heck, I even played Yaris for like, 10 seconds.

1397
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:21,560
So alright, let's move on with some more gaming news, and I'm gonna get to a story about PlayStation

1398
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,600
hardware in Japan.

1399
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,480
I believe there's a new bundle that has come out there in Japan.

1400
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:34,600
It's a charcoal black console, decreased power consumption they're saying, a 320 gig hard

1401
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,600
drive with it.

1402
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,880
It's a model CECH 3000B, and it was announced by Sony in Japan over the weekend.

1403
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:48,080
It is going to be 34,980 yen, and there will also be a 160 gig version of the model that

1404
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:55,400
will come with Tales of Zilia, that is coming for $470, so you get that game.

1405
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,400
Not coming in this new bundle, an HDMI cable.

1406
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
That is true.

1407
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,400
No HDMI cable.

1408
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,200
And you know what else is coming in that bundle?

1409
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,640
New game encryption.

1410
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,040
Oh, is that really why they're trying to get the hardware out there?

1411
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,960
They're putting out new hardware that's gonna change the way the keys are stored.

1412
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,840
Although, gotta have some sort of backwards compatibility because, or, I remember, they're

1413
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:24,640
moving the, instead of having the actual keys built in, or the authentication keys built

1414
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,000
into the console itself, it's being built into the Blu-ray drive.

1415
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,300
Much like how the 360 works, whereas they have it, you know, all the authentication

1416
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:43,240
stuff is through the Blu-ray drive, or their DVD drive, obviously Blu-ray, not on the Xbox

1417
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,240
360.

1418
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,240
Alright.

1419
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,480
DarkStalker, what do you got for us before we get to release dates?

1420
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,180
Well, we have some little buggies fixed with the 3DS.

1421
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:58,680
There were a couple problems the different consumers were saying that was going on, and

1422
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,720
according to Mr. Reggie, he says they're fixed.

1423
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:08,720
He said that the eShop is fixing one of them, because, well, it didn't launch with the eShop.

1424
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,400
It didn't shop with, yeah.

1425
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:19,720
And the other thing is that they're basically, the biggest hang-up was that they didn't have

1426
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,680
a big Nintendo franchise, so they said they're fixing that too.

1427
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,760
In other words, we had no launch games, basically, is that what I'm hearing out of that.

1428
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,200
Well, that's why I didn't buy one.

1429
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,560
Their strongest launch title was from Capcom.

1430
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,280
I think it was Dead or Alive.

1431
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,480
I get, unless you want to count Pilotwings.

1432
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,720
Dead or Alive was apparently very terrible.

1433
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,800
I've heard from a lot of people that Dead or Alive was really good.

1434
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,880
Technically it didn't launch with Dead or Alive, that came out, I mean Launch Window,

1435
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
or whatever you want to call it.

1436
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,360
That is some bullshit there, Launch Window.

1437
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,600
Technically, it launched with the web store, because it was within the launch window.

1438
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,320
Well, how about I pay you at the end of the launch window, how's that sound?

1439
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,320
That doesn't work, no?

1440
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,760
I'm excited about the idea that Netflix might come to the 3DS, because I like the idea of

1441
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,840
having kind of like the portable device to watch.

1442
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,840
Oh Rob.

1443
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,840
I mean, granted, I know there's the phone, but also not just the portable thing in the

1444
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,360
bed with, I think, a larger screen on those things, but also the possibility of actual

1445
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,720
3D movies.

1446
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,080
Even though a lot of 3D movies are kind of eh, it's kind of cool in a way.

1447
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:26,400
I don't think it's going to be able to do 3D right, since it's all in particular anyway.

1448
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,120
They'd have to code it for, they'd have to re-image them to be specific for the lenticular

1449
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,120
monitor.

1450
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,640
Yeah, because like the 3DS, 3D doesn't bother me at all, it's kind of cool.

1451
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,640
But it's not real 3D.

1452
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,760
The 3DS and the theater, I don't like.

1453
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
It's not real 3D.

1454
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,760
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1455
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,500
I don't think it would be that difficult for them to do that, I mean, they do that already

1456
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,720
with, you know, Blu-ray 3D stuff, I mean, there's a bunch of different formats that,

1457
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,120
you know, 3D TV support, so I don't see why that would be a problem.

1458
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:54,600
Hey, you gotta admit, if Tron's gonna end up on 3D Netflix, you gotta at least check

1459
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,600
that out.

1460
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,200
That's gonna be pretty awesome.

1461
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,920
You know, it's funny, right before Tron was coming out, they was like, let's go get 3D

1462
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,920
TV, let's go get 3D TV, Tron's coming out, let's go get 3D TV.

1463
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,920
I'm like, no.

1464
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,920
So.

1465
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:12,440
Alright, so we'll see if, I'm really curious to see how 3DS will sell this holiday.

1466
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,760
This is definitely gonna be a make or break time for 3DS.

1467
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,760
Well, I was just a little annoyed that they were talking about like franchises coming

1468
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
out.

1469
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,480
Look at all the things we announced that are gonna be coming out, you know, like, you know,

1470
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,560
all these different franchises that aren't coming out until the fourth quarter.

1471
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,440
The 3DS is gonna get really awesome soon.

1472
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,440
Soon.

1473
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,320
You know, like in a few months, when it's awesome.

1474
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,880
Right now you have a paperweight.

1475
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,080
Enjoy your blue brick.

1476
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,760
I gotta tell you though, I mean, based off of what's, you know, scheduled to come out

1477
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,960
for the 3DS, it's not all that exciting.

1478
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,960
It's about as exciting as the DS is.

1479
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,960
It really is not.

1480
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,800
It's really into Ocarina of Time, I mean, that's one of the stronger titles right now.

1481
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Yeah.

1482
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,280
But, I mean, even like new release stuff, there's really not anything, like, exclusive

1483
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,280
for it.

1484
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,760
It's like, oh my god, I gotta have that.

1485
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,460
Alright, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.

1486
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,720
What can you get at a store near you for some other consoles in your house this week, starting

1487
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,720
in the US?

1488
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,760
Well, today, and I know this was on everybody's radar, but Mystery Case files the Malgrave

1489
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,540
Incident out for the Nintendo Wii, yes.

1490
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,540
That's the same suit.

1491
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,920
You gotta give me my pre-order.

1492
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,960
That's the same franchise that was on the DS.

1493
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,000
Ooh, I'm so excited about that.

1494
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,120
Thank you, Nintendo.

1495
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,840
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition on the 360 in case you don't own a console version

1496
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,040
of Super Street Fighter IV, you can buy that with the DLC already in there, otherwise you

1497
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:40,800
can just download the DLC and that's on 360 and PS3.

1498
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:45,440
Another game series that really a lot of people don't care about, Dynasty Warriors Gundam

1499
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,440
3.

1500
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:52,320
Yes, they've made three of them now and that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.

1501
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,760
Sniper Ghost Warrior finally making its way out on PS3.

1502
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,420
A re-release of Call of Duty Black Ops, now the limited edition with the first strike

1503
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,680
download content bundled in there.

1504
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,560
Resident Evil The Mercenaries for the 3DS, I believe we have a story about that later.

1505
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,000
Boy, other fun stuff is coming out this week.

1506
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,480
Three Stories Curse of the Ancient Spirit, that's exciting.

1507
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:33,320
And finally, UFC Personal Trainer, the Ultimate Fitness System, that's right, it is a UFC

1508
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:39,120
themed fitness game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1509
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:48,080
Alright, well going over to Japan and checking out the Japanese releases, coming out on the

1510
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:55,280
Xbox 360 from Sega on June 30th is Power Smash 4, that's just basically Virtua Tennis.

1511
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:00,840
I got really excited for a minute because I thought it might be Power Stone, but no

1512
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,400
it's Power Smash which is Virtua Tennis.

1513
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,440
The Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition comes out in Japan as well and Test Drive

1514
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,520
Unlimited 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the Xbox 360.

1515
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:16,080
Going over to the PlayStation 3 in Japan, Initial D Extreme Stage gets a price reduction

1516
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,800
as does Senjou no Valkyria which I believe is Valkyria Chronicles over there in Japan

1517
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,800
gets its price reductions.

1518
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,160
Power Smash 4 or Virtua Tennis also on the PlayStation 3 this week, it's a big SEGA week.

1519
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,140
And the same games, Super Street Fighter IV and Test Drive Unlimited 2 all making their

1520
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:38,260
way to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

1521
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:41,560
Going over to some other consoles, how about the Sony PSP?

1522
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,780
We have Initial D Street Stage getting a price reduction as well as some other releases.

1523
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:50,440
Two Heart 2 Dungeon Travelers comes out in regular and limited edition, again that's

1524
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,400
for the PSP.

1525
01:10:52,400 --> 01:11:01,400
This is a game, it's an RPG where I guess it's kind of like they're reliving their childhood

1526
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,180
fantasies or something but then you have the chick in the maid outfit with her legs up

1527
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,760
and you're like, I don't want to think about childhood fantasies and see those pictures

1528
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,760
so I don't know.

1529
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,760
It's a very...

1530
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,360
Kind of childhood fantasies, are they having pedo bear childhood fantasies?

1531
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,420
That actually makes me think of an anime that I started watching.

1532
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,800
On the Wii, do I even want to know what anime?

1533
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,760
Are you sure it was an anime?

1534
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:30,340
It's called something like My Little Sister Can't Be That Cute and basically this guy

1535
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,840
finds out that his sister, who's totally cool and popular with all of her friends and everything,

1536
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:42,880
is a closet otaku and her fandom is Little Sister Hentai.

1537
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,400
On the Wii, Biohazard and Biohazard Zero get a price reduction.

1538
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,760
The show itself isn't dirty but she's into it.

1539
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,160
Oh Japan, never change.

1540
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:58,160
You heard about the guy in Canada, right, who brought Mango over there and got arrested

1541
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,040
because of their child pornography laws or something like that and it faces up to a year.

1542
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:10,120
It faces a minimum of a year in jail and apparently all manga is banned there.

1543
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,040
I guess it makes the video game laws here not seem so bad.

1544
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,160
Anyhow, of course, Biohazard is Resident Evil, Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero get price

1545
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,160
reductions.

1546
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:24,200
Also, finally, coming out on the Wii in Japan this week, Goldeneye 007, that's right.

1547
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,360
The game we got here over the holidays, you can now play in Japan.

1548
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,160
I'm assuming it's been localized and such for the region, hence the great delay.

1549
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,160
And then you can play the game and then remember how much better it was on the Nintendo 64.

1550
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:43,440
Lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Tales of the Abyss from Bandai Namco, which, is

1551
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,760
this an official Tales game?

1552
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Wait, what?

1553
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,760
Yes it is.

1554
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
Yes it is.

1555
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,760
It happens to be my favorite Tales game.

1556
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,560
Well, guess what, it's on the 3DS this week in Japan.

1557
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,140
God damn it, Japan.

1558
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,140
God damn it, Namco.

1559
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,560
You can import it on your region free.

1560
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,560
Oh wait, no you can't.

1561
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,560
No way.

1562
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,560
That's right, they got rid of that on the 3DS and there's no bastards.

1563
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:09,680
See, that's what I was talking about, Namco always screwing over anything that's not Japanese.

1564
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,200
Alright moving on, how about UK releases Dark Sakura?

1565
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
She's chatting with Chaz.

1566
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,520
I'm telling Penis Man that he's not weird.

1567
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:22,600
Oh and by the way, the name of the anime is called Ore no Emoto ga Konan ni Koai wa Kani

1568
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
ga Nai.

1569
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,040
That's tight.

1570
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,040
It's actually really funny.

1571
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,280
So are you stroking Penis Man's ego in the chat?

1572
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,800
On the 28th we have Call of Duty Black Ops, Annihilation Pack, or as my brain initially

1573
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,680
saw it, Black Oops.

1574
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:43,080
And then on the 29th we have Backbreaker Vengeance, ooh, which sounds kind of dirty.

1575
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:49,160
And then Half Minute Heroes, Super Mega Neo Climax, which also sounds kind of dirty.

1576
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
I know.

1577
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,080
I wouldn't want to meet the Half Minute Heroes.

1578
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:56,480
That series is actually kind of cool, that's the sick thing is that 30 second hero, whatever

1579
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,260
they call it here, is actually kind of fun.

1580
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,260
It's a neat series.

1581
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:02,960
I just wouldn't want to meet the Half Minute Hero in his climax.

1582
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,680
Didn't they have that come out in Xbox Live Arcade?

1583
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,680
I think I dated him.

1584
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,680
Spooked.

1585
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:13,280
Did he post on DDR Freak 2?

1586
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Shush you.

1587
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh, God gets it.

1588
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Alright.

1589
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
No.

1590
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I only have one thing to say about that game.

1591
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I know that.

1592
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Spooked.

1593
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,040
Moving on, two more stories for you, and then the classic game of the week.

1594
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:36,880
So I know this isn't the 90s, and this isn't The Matrix, but apparently Ubisoft wants you

1595
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:43,880
to beat Neo at Child of Eden, a game that's sort of like The Matrix, because you're, hmm,

1596
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:51,040
I know Kung Fu, flying around, less Keanu Reeves, but no, the artist Neo, apparently

1597
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:59,040
he has a high score on the Evolution level, and to, I guess, boost Ubisoft's donation

1598
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:05,760
of the Japanese earthquake relief, you have to try to beat his score.

1599
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:13,300
100,000 is already pledged, but for every score on the level, it's normal connect leaderboard

1600
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:19,800
exceeding Neo's 306,800 points between now and July 4th, Ubisoft will add an additional

1601
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:25,400
dollar up to a maximum of 20,000 dollars.

1602
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,400
Why Neo?

1603
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,860
I don't understand why that artist out of, you know, I just don't think of Neo when I

1604
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,580
think of Child of Eden, you know?

1605
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,080
Maybe he's a fan of the game.

1606
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,880
Maybe Samuel L. Jackson had something else going on, or Ice-T, you know, he was too busy

1607
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:47,920
pimping Call of Duty.

1608
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,960
Let me just compare a little bit here, okay?

1609
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,240
We have Neo, ready?

1610
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,240
Here's Neo.

1611
01:15:53,240 --> 01:16:01,880
Okay, I don't think I've heard that song at the club before, right?

1612
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:08,000
So there's Neo, and then here is Child of Eden.

1613
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:21,640
That's right, you're getting a headache, because those two don't go together.

1614
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,640
Completely different key.

1615
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,320
Whatever, I guess whatever brings awareness to the game.

1616
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,480
All right, this has been some pretty controversial news this week.

1617
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,280
Team Fortress 2 went free to play, if you haven't already heard, and yeah, it's interesting

1618
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,720
because of course Steam has released a lot of free to play games, other people's games,

1619
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,120
you know, including things like Spiral Knights and Champions Online and things that for the

1620
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,160
most part were already free to play.

1621
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,080
But Valve has taken one of its most popular games and made it free to play, and of course

1622
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:55,940
there's been lots of hooray, free shit, and then there's been lots of boo, this game I

1623
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:02,480
paid for five years ago is now free and that makes me angry, because, you know, games don't

1624
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,520
ever go on sale or, you know, end up in a bargain bin.

1625
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,160
That's totally not how I wound up with most of my Steam collection anyway.

1626
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:15,360
There are so many butthurt people about this going free to play, there are apparently servers

1627
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,900
that are auto-banning people that are detected on the free to play version, there are people

1628
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,580
that are just like, our game is ruined because of free to play, and so forth, and to those

1629
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:28,840
people I say, fuck off immediately, because you are what's wrong with gaming right now.

1630
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,000
Cry some more.

1631
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,580
That whole, like, elitist asshole attitude just isn't gonna get you anywhere.

1632
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,580
Like in life.

1633
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,580
Period.

1634
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:41,960
It reminds me of when Steam had the free weekends of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2, and Black

1635
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,440
Ops.

1636
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,480
There was nothing but disdain to lower level folk because they were, you know, trial noobs,

1637
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:53,240
they were weekend warriors, they were too cheap to play, you know, buy the real thing.

1638
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,280
I'm like, dude, fuck you, I might actually buy it.

1639
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,600
If you guys weren't such dicks.

1640
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:04,160
Yeah, I mean, and the game is, the game is five years old, and to be fair, Valve, although

1641
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:08,400
they, you know, have done so many updates over the past few years and so forth, this

1642
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,160
has gotten people talking about the game more than anything in quite some time.

1643
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,280
It's just a refreshing break from complaining about hats.

1644
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,280
I guess so.

1645
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,280
That could be true.

1646
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:23,000
But yeah, I mean, I for one, I downloaded the game some time ago, I paid for it, you

1647
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,880
know, it came with the orange box, and I'm not mad that it went free to play because

1648
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,480
I realized I bought it several years ago and I could have been playing it then this entire

1649
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,480
time.

1650
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,320
And then, because I got old, why did it get old to me?

1651
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,840
I had nobody to play with, because I don't want to play with elitist assholes.

1652
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,760
Well gee, I'm sorry, Rob, you should have poked me some time.

1653
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,760
But...

1654
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,760
Uh...

1655
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,760
Not in that way, not that way.

1656
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,320
You must buy me a drink first.

1657
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,320
Whoo!

1658
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:52,320
But, but, I mean, for real though, like, this news, if anything, makes me maybe want to

1659
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,400
go back and play Team Fortress 2 because I know there'll be other people to play with,

1660
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,280
who will be as terrible as me, or at least not be jerks about it if they are pretty good.

1661
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,080
You know what I mean?

1662
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,040
Otherwise I hadn't really given this game a second thought, and yet I don't feel like

1663
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,520
I wasted my money.

1664
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,680
The orange box was one of the best deals ever in gaming.

1665
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,680
Ever!

1666
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,680
One of the best deals.

1667
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:17,480
Oh yeah, but where were people complaining when, uh, when Portal became free for a limited

1668
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,480
time?

1669
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
Hmm?

1670
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,160
Oh wait, that's not multiplayer.

1671
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,320
We're not an unpleasable fanbase when it comes to that, are we?

1672
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,160
Melted General in our chat says Team Fortress 2 is on its 218th update.

1673
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,160
Uh, that's...

1674
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,160
It is a lot of updates.

1675
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,760
Now Rob, did it do that free, did it, did it, like, have you start downloading the Team

1676
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,720
Fortress 2 beta?

1677
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,480
I don't know, because I bought the game years ago, so...

1678
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,000
Well I mean, I bought mine a long time ago, and it's, it, suddenly I looked on there and

1679
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,960
it says downloading Team Fortress 2 beta.

1680
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,420
Which is weird.

1681
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,040
It might be a free beta or something, who knows.

1682
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:52,940
Uh, the Rob D. in our chatroom at chat.org.com says I'm pissed in the way anyone is when

1683
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,000
something goes on sale after they bought it.

1684
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,080
I don't feel like Valve should refund me or anything, such is life.

1685
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,080
That's kind of how I feel too.

1686
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,080
You gotta be pissed at yourself.

1687
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,440
I bought Left 4 Dead 2 when it was 20 bucks.

1688
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,440
The day after it became 7.

1689
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,280
Yeah, I bought Torchlight for what, like 10, and then like, I think literally a day later

1690
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,280
it was 5.

1691
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,720
Oh well, shit happens.

1692
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,720
Exactly.

1693
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:17,160
You know, where it's like, you go buy a video game and then you find out, oh, if I bought

1694
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:21,740
it on, you know, or bought it at Best Buy, I would have got a $10 card with it, you know.

1695
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:24,400
These deals, this is just how it works.

1696
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,080
You have to shop around for the best deals, and if you don't, oh well on you, you know.

1697
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,800
There's more money in that damn game.

1698
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,960
I would have been pissed if I'd bought Team Fortress 2 like two weeks ago, but I would

1699
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,720
have been pissed in the way that somebody who buys Apple products gets pissed every

1700
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,720
year.

1701
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:47,960
Oh, people who, uh, get used to one Adobe suite only to find out that CS6 is coming

1702
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,480
out in a few months, fuck you Adobe.

1703
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,880
Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Team Fortress 2 going free, great, and I also bought

1704
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,680
the orange box, surprised you didn't go free sooner.

1705
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:04,120
I just, I haven't heard a lot of like the FPS's or hell even like really the Valve-owned

1706
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,800
games going free to play.

1707
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,600
Will Half-Life Episode 3 be free to play?

1708
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,640
Well for what it's worth, as long as you paid some sort of money in Team Fortress 2, you

1709
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,640
get perks.

1710
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,160
They're not leaving us out in the lurch completely.

1711
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:24,480
All of this, and Dungeon Buster, it said TF2 going free, great, I also bought the orange

1712
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,480
box.

1713
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,480
I bought the orange box.

1714
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,480
I have it on Xbox.

1715
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,480
Guess what?

1716
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:34,160
I like playing better on my PC, so all this stuff going free, woo.

1717
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:38,520
Also in our chat room, Penis Man asks, so are we gonna form an all-games Team Suck?

1718
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,140
Sure, works for me.

1719
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,440
If that name isn't already taken, which it probably is.

1720
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,240
I'll roll up the group name when I get home.

1721
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,240
Alright, there you go.

1722
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,240
Team Suck.

1723
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,240
I could do it.

1724
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,840
Actually there is, well there isn't, to be real, there is an OLR team already out there.

1725
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,440
It's something Deep Man put together a long time ago, so I mean, there is already an OLR

1726
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:01,520
team, and you know, I'm not saying this in a negative way, but they suck.

1727
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,520
I know we do.

1728
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,000
Or at least they will when I start playing on it.

1729
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,720
We don't need your help to suck, Rob.

1730
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:12,480
Black Wolf wants to clarify, yeah, except Apple will refund you within a certain time

1731
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,480
frame.

1732
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,920
You know, if I had bought Team Fortress 2 two weeks ago, which I don't know who did,

1733
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,680
but I wonder if you were to call Valve and complain if maybe they would give a refund.

1734
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,680
Who knows?

1735
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,640
Alright, there you go, let's get to the part of the show where we take a trip down memory

1736
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:29,640
lane.

1737
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,640
We trip and fall.

1738
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,640
Put some bricks.

1739
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:36,200
It's the classic game of the week.

1740
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,640
Dark Sakura is going to take a stroll down classic gaming's path and find the most obscure

1741
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:44,640
fucking game she can to be the game of the week, which I believe is the case this week,

1742
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,640
correct?

1743
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,640
Yes, actually.

1744
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,640
I will say something.

1745
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,840
This is a game that I have talked about before.

1746
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,040
So it's, it's not really a surprise, it's probably a surprise to people that haven't

1747
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,040
brought it up already.

1748
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,360
So the game of the week is called Emerald Dragon.

1749
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,720
And importers, PC Engine fans, you will know this one.

1750
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,880
Lots of dialogue, by the way.

1751
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:15,880
The game is an RPG done by Glodia, which they did, they're actually created by Telnet employees,

1752
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,800
including Tenpei Sato, who was behind Disgaea.

1753
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,280
So this game could be, in theory, a precursor to Disgaea.

1754
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,720
Does it have prenees?

1755
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:33,280
I only played through like the first very part of it, Rob, I was like, I can't read

1756
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,280
that much Japanese.

1757
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,280
It's a valid question.

1758
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:46,040
Anyway, it came out for PC-88 in 1989, and then came to PC-98, X68000, MSX2, FM Towne's

1759
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:51,520
computer, and then the console versions were the PC Engine, CD, and Super Famicom, but

1760
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,480
they weren't done by Glodia.

1761
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,000
So there's no versions that are outside of Japan, but you can get a fan's translation

1762
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,120
for the Super Famicom version by Translation Corporation.

1763
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,580
So look for it if you really want to play it.

1764
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,040
So basically, it's a big RPG.

1765
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:11,160
There was a war in the past, and then lots of battle, and then there were two races that

1766
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,320
lived on the main continent, and the Emerald Dragon was our champion, and then the Emerald

1767
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,000
Dragon died and a curse fell over the land, blah, blah, blah.

1768
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,920
So now the last dragons are around, and you have to pretty much help them out.

1769
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:30,360
You actually find a green-haired girl whose name is Tamarin, which means purity, in the

1770
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:33,880
ancient dragon language.

1771
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,440
We'll call her Virgin.

1772
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,440
Virgin.

1773
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:43,120
But anyway, she has amnesia, so I won't spoil the game for you.

1774
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:48,440
There's also Barsem, Farnah, Hathrum, Khorsra, lots of different people, but basically it's

1775
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:53,320
a traditional JRPG, but it has some pretty different combat.

1776
01:24:53,320 --> 01:25:01,840
It has a large world to look over, but it's one big, unified piece, except in the Super

1777
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,840
Famicom version.

1778
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,640
Dude, the combat in this looks like Ultima.

1779
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,640
Yeah.

1780
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:13,560
It reminds me of Treasure Hunter G, another gem that never made it to the States.

1781
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,480
The combat looks dead-on like Treasure Hunter G.

1782
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:21,320
Well, if they came out around the same time, then that could, you know, or by a similar

1783
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,320
team.

1784
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,600
One was made by Square, and the other, yeah.

1785
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:33,360
Well, at any rate, the way that it works is that your timing for your attack is based

1786
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,280
on your equipment.

1787
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:41,360
And then, but the only character that you can control is the main character, Attrucian.

1788
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:47,160
The other characters are done by the AI, but the AI is actually pretty smart.

1789
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,680
At any rate, with the Super Famicom version of this game, it has a dragon transformation

1790
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,280
system so Attrucian can take on a dragon form.

1791
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,280
And it's pretty cool.

1792
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,240
I have the PC Engine version, I have a copy of the PC Engine version of this, I should

1793
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:06,720
say, because the game costs in excess of $300 on eBay, on PC Engine.

1794
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,720
Yikes.

1795
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:12,800
One of my friends has this game, which is how I got my copy.

1796
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:19,280
She's also the same one who hooked us up with Dracula X when she owed us $100, so.

1797
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:27,480
And, but I mean basically, it's standard PC Engine fare as far as the screens, you know,

1798
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:33,600
you've got the 16-bit sprites, and then you've got lots of voice acting, because hey, we're

1799
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,060
doing these games on a CD now, not on HuCards.

1800
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,480
And all the audio in it is Redbook audio.

1801
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:44,120
So you can actually just pop a CD in your car, as long as you skip track two.

1802
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,120
Nice.

1803
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:52,360
So, but that is one of, I think, the gems in any PC Engine collector's archive.

1804
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:59,600
Like, if I had to have three games in my PC Engine, actually no I don't have a copy of

1805
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,040
this one, I have Sapphire, no I don't have Sapphire, so if I had to have three games

1806
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:10,040
that were in my, the top tier PC Engine, it would be Dracula X, which I've got, it would

1807
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:14,160
be Emerald Dragon and Sapphire, which I've covered Sapphire before.

1808
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,880
So those would be the three.

1809
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,640
So you've got your action game, you have your RPG, and you have your shooter.

1810
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,640
So this is Emerald Dragon.

1811
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,640
Alright.

1812
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,080
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1813
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:29,240
Very obscure, very hard to find, but very intricate for its time with the voice acting

1814
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,240
and everything.

1815
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,240
Emerald Dragon.

1816
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,940
It actually makes it more playable too, because then I at least have somewhat of a clue of

1817
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,760
what's going on in the game.

1818
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,980
But yeah, if I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon, and like, oh look it's Sparna.

1819
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:48,160
If I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and not pay like, you know, 300 bucks for

1820
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,760
it, I would be pretty stoked.

1821
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,680
Alright, your classic game of the week, Emerald Dragon on the PC Engine.

1822
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,800
And that's going to bring us to the close of part A, but don't go anywhere guys, we're

1823
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,960
going to come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, lots of news in part B tonight, some

1824
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,120
music game based news believe it or not, we're going to kick it off with.

1825
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,720
Your Twitter topics, so get those in, twitter.com slash olr, any topics like news stories and

1826
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:13,040
so forth, or if you just have a question you want to ask us, you know, it's the birthday

1827
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,000
show and all, maybe there's something that's burning on your mind that you want to ask

1828
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,360
us, or perhaps our guests, one of the two.

1829
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,720
Jessica Harper from Understation Live is of course here at the studio, or intern Drew,

1830
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,800
maybe you have a question for them, you can send those to twitter.com slash olr.

1831
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,800
And we'll have more stories coming up for you guys, FUs of the Week, Skype calls, and

1832
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:40,360
plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1833
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:47,040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we are live with episode number 417, I actually

1834
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:52,640
had to look that up, 9 years of Orange Lounge Radio, it's June 26th, 2011 when we're taping

1835
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,720
of course the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, June the 23rd, because Sundays

1836
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,560
were on different days back then, of 2002.

1837
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,960
We're joined in studio tonight not only by of course my co-host Dark Soccer and Loki,

1838
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,400
always here with us, but by some special guests, intern Drew is in the kitchen, but here in

1839
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:14,740
studio with us the lovely Jessica Harper from Understation Live, that's getting birthday

1840
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:19,840
spankings later this month for its 10th anniversary show, I mean next month, because we're late

1841
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:26,340
June, so next month I guess, within a month, basically two weeks from now-ish, exactly.

1842
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:30,720
And we've been spending a lot of the time earlier in the show kind of reminiscing about

1843
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:35,240
the good old days of OLR, back when we were playing a lot of DDR and so forth, and for

1844
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:40,040
those that haven't heard the story, Jessica and I actually played DDR for the first time

1845
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,040
together.

1846
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,800
I didn't see DDR the first time with Jessica, but I'm convinced I walked into the first

1847
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,680
Milpitas Golf Land tournament and didn't know what I was walking into.

1848
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:55,560
But later we were at the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Convention, in Las Vegas, at

1849
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:02,280
the Circus Circus, and the machine was calling our name, and it was saying, I-I-I, you know

1850
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:07,960
you wanna play my ass, exactly, and we actually skipped, what was it, Shock Treatment or something

1851
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,800
on Friday, which is a shitty movie anyway, yeah, basically we were bored to tears, we

1852
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,320
just wanted to relax and go have some, you know, casino time, and we were having our

1853
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:20,760
own convention, yeah, we were like, okay, let's go get drunk at, across the way over

1854
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,840
at Quark's Bar, and exactly, since we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Rocky Horror

1855
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,520
community anyway, why don't we just go play DDR, exactly, we had fun, it was a good time.

1856
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,720
But um, also that weekend, and I bring this up because this is kind of topical as of recently,

1857
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:40,960
but uh, we went to the Adventure Dome, which is uh, is it even there anymore, it's at Circus

1858
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,360
Circus, it's like a theme park, indoors at Circus Circus in Vegas, I don't even know

1859
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:48,040
if it's there anymore, like, including uh, it had a full roller coaster and everything,

1860
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,640
yeah, it was actually a pretty badass little place, yeah, I think, I don't think it's there

1861
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:56,080
anywhere, because now New York has their roller coaster. I know we have some Vegas people,

1862
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,400
so I'm sure somebody will chime in in a minute in our chat room and let us know, but um,

1863
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,440
you know, we were at the Adventure Dome, and one of the things that they had there, and

1864
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:07,080
we spent a little money on, about 20 bucks on, and it was a memory that would haunt me

1865
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:11,560
forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and it was, and you have to keep in

1866
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:16,740
mind that this was 11 years ago, yes, this is even older than, yeah, Understation Live

1867
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:19,580
or, uh, Orange

1868
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:51,720
K.C.D. has still lodged in my throat from eating, but she can belt it out, and like,

1869
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,160
I'm kinda like, oh, I know Love Shack, but of course I had to do the guy part, and I'm

1870
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:58,720
like, I kinda don't remember how the guy part goes, so I remember at one point, and I got

1871
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:05,480
teased over this for like seven years, I would go, Funky Little Shack, Funky Little Shack,

1872
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,920
like I'm like trying to read the words as they highlight, which, you know, in the song

1873
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:15,080
is Funky Little Shack, yeah, I got the song later, but unfortunately, yeah, and that actually

1874
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:20,480
became our karaoke song, when Rob and I used to go out to karaoke on a fairly regular basis,

1875
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:25,120
that was one of our songs that we did together, you know, other than, what was the other one,

1876
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:32,240
Human League, Don't You Want Me Baby, so yeah, we actually did kind of eventually incorporated

1877
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,360
into our repertoire.

1878
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:38,980
So but it's interesting, because whereas that kinda went to go make an ass out of me, it

1879
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:43,840
actually showed off that you can sing girl, and I know you've seen that, I know one of

1880
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,400
your other Cornerstone songs is What's Goin' On by Four Non-Blondes, or What's Up by Four

1881
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,480
Non-Blondes, and Pat Benatar song you always used to sing too, right?

1882
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,480
Hit Me With Your Best Shot.

1883
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,480
That's right, Hit Me With Your Best Shot.

1884
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,480
Whip Me With Your Big Cock.

1885
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,480
Sometimes, depending on how drunk she was, she might get up on stage.

1886
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:01,920
I remember, you know, it was a gay bar, I remember a certain occasion though at Great

1887
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:06,360
America with someone recording Stay, yeah, that too.

1888
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:14,160
And then me doing Like A Prayer, which I foolishly let Travis even touch that CD.

1889
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,160
Anyhow.

1890
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:18,800
You should never ever ever let Travis have access to anything that you think might, yeah.

1891
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:25,200
I seem to remember also a certain Karaoke Revolution incident with the two of you.

1892
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:29,800
And that was when I discovered that this could really belt it out, I was stunned.

1893
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,240
But you are, you're still doing the vocal thing, right?

1894
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,680
I know we said for years, like Jess, you should go try out for American Idol, you should go

1895
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,680
try out for American Idol.

1896
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,920
Well, now you can't try out for American Idol because you're too old, as we all are.

1897
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,440
But there's this new show where age doesn't matter, The Voice, right?

1898
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,800
And have you been watching the show, you're really into it?

1899
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,760
I am very, very much into it.

1900
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,280
I heard about it after the first episode, caught up with it online and fell in love

1901
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:58,520
with it instantly because the entire concept of The Voice is that you are just a voice.

1902
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:03,440
You have, there's no physical you attached to it, it's just a voice in the air.

1903
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,800
The judges, their chairs are turned completely around, so they can't even see what the hell

1904
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,800
you look like.

1905
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:13,200
You're just singing to them, and they hit their button and turn around to accept you,

1906
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,800
no matter what you look like.

1907
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,640
And by the way, yes, this does relate to video games, because this show is so huge.

1908
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:22,040
There will be a video game based on it in six months, I guarantee it.

1909
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,040
Oh, I'm sure.

1910
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,040
I guarantee it.

1911
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,040
So, um, so, so then now we have a new question.

1912
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,960
When are you going to try out for The Voice?

1913
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,280
August 24th in San Francisco.

1914
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,480
Wow.

1915
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,680
So you're doing it.

1916
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,960
I'm actually doing it, yeah.

1917
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:35,960
Oh my God.

1918
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,680
There's a full campaign going right now.

1919
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:44,600
I have a Facebook page, which goes by my, here you go, big moment on your ninth anniversary

1920
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,600
show.

1921
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,320
I'm going to reveal my real last name because-

1922
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,280
Oh, even I'm not going to do that.

1923
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,280
Because unfortunately there's no other way for me, and I couldn't just put myself as

1924
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,880
Jessica Harper because I think Jessica Harper would get pretty pissed off.

1925
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:04,280
So um, Jessica Friesen, um, if you go to facebook.com slash Jess Sings, um-

1926
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,280
How many S's is that?

1927
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,280
J-E-S-S-

1928
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,280
Three.

1929
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,280
Okay.

1930
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,280
S-I-N-G-S.

1931
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,280
Okay.

1932
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,280
Four.

1933
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,280
Well, yeah, if you can't throw it at the end.

1934
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,280
Um, you can-

1935
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,280
Rob, the master of the English language.

1936
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,280
I know.

1937
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,200
While she's auditioning for The Voice, I will be auditioning for Wheel of Fortune.

1938
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,760
Rob is not the cunning linguist.

1939
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,240
So you can go ahead and check out my stuff.

1940
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,640
I actually have, uh, things on there.

1941
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:33,720
Also on ReverbNation, um, dot com slash Jessica Friesen, um, that has not only the version

1942
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:38,760
of Stay that Jamie had mentioned earlier, as well as the video of Rob and I doing that

1943
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,320
infamous love shack.

1944
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:46,080
Now keep in mind, again, the video, it was from VHS and it is 11 years old.

1945
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,560
The years have not been-

1946
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:48,560
Before we had DVD.

1947
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,480
Yeah, the years have not been nice to the recording, but you still get the hint.

1948
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:57,480
Um, and then there's also two recordings in there that are from when I was briefly with

1949
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,480
the band as well.

1950
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:03,800
So, um, vocals, lyrics that were written by me and obviously sung by me.

1951
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,160
So yeah, please check it out.

1952
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,160
Fan me and stuff.

1953
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,160
Cause-

1954
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,800
Yeah, let's, let's, um, let's, uh, Dark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind, would you post the link

1955
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,480
in chat and, uh, chatters, if you wouldn't mind, let's help Jess out with some likes

1956
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:19,120
and get her on The Voice because then when she wins, we can say it all started here.

1957
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,120
Yeah.

1958
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:24,840
The Reverb Nation page, thereverbnation.com slash Jessica Friesen, um, that actually is

1959
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,160
what I gave to the people at The Voice as my page.

1960
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,160
Nice.

1961
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,160
As my music page.

1962
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,880
So I had to have examples of my music and the more likes that I can get on there, the

1963
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,880
better off I am.

1964
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,080
And I'm already up in the 50 ish people now.

1965
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,080
So if I can boost that up a little more.

1966
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,080
A few more.

1967
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,080
Yeah.

1968
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,080
All right, let's do it.

1969
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,080
Good luck to you.

1970
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,080
And let us know how that goes.

1971
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,400
You know, and sometimes I don't even know what to expect on those auditions, but you

1972
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,600
know, there's going to be thousands of people there.

1973
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,720
So if nothing else, go for the experience and have a blast.

1974
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,720
Yeah.

1975
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,720
So that's my whole intention.

1976
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,600
I mean, I don't even expect anything to happen, but at least if I get out there and do it,

1977
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,640
I can say that, you know, I tried, I at least gave it my best effort.

1978
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:05,600
Well, Tiger Claw in our chat room says, if Jessica makes it big on American Idol, I hope

1979
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,280
she will remember all those who knew her on OLR.

1980
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,600
Well, I can guarantee you that won't be happening because she's trying out for The Voice.

1981
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,160
Wrong show.

1982
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:16,680
Anyhow, Salacious Pop has some karaoke requests for Jess and Rob.

1983
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,680
Oh really?

1984
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,480
So karaoke requests for Jessica and Rob.

1985
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,480
Let's see here.

1986
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,080
Close to You by The Carpenters.

1987
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,000
No, I know what I want.

1988
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,760
Why Do Birds?

1989
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,160
I actually used to do it.

1990
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:31,880
Part of my problem with Alone is that I am no longer the soprano that I used to be, but

1991
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:36,640
you catch me with enough alcohol in my system, you might make that happen.

1992
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:40,020
Love Will to Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille.

1993
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,200
And lastly, Don't Go Breakin' My Heart by Elton John and RuPaul.

1994
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:48,280
You know what, they need to show up because I have a Captain and Tennille song on my iTunes.

1995
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,280
Thank you.

1996
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,280
I have Muskrat Love.

1997
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,440
But another, I could possibly get them to take it down a couple of notes, you know.

1998
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:58,760
If I can get that highest note, like just a little bit further down.

1999
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:04,280
Did you, okay, did you happen to watch American Idol when Carly Smithson was on?

2000
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,280
Okay.

2001
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,200
We'll get back to video games at some point.

2002
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:11,280
She did Jesus Christ Superstar, but she's not, her voice isn't that high.

2003
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:19,160
So she actually harmonized, actually did a countermelody part and got away with it.

2004
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,160
So I love it.

2005
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,440
Our buddy Travis is in chat or DJ Morpheus is in chat.

2006
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,760
And in response to the whole Jessica saying, you know, we can say it's all started here

2007
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:29,760
on OLR.

2008
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,520
DJ Morpheus says, no, she won't.

2009
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,560
She'll be wearing a USL shirt when she's on TV.

2010
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,440
If she doesn't, she's fired.

2011
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,440
Touche.

2012
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:41,080
And technically, you know, the entire thing did start over there because I did officially

2013
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,080
announce it over there.

2014
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,080
I know.

2015
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,080
Fair enough.

2016
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,080
Fair enough.

2017
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,080
But it would still be fun.

2018
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,080
I'll be all right.

2019
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,920
I embarrassed the shit out of myself with that bitch 11 years ago.

2020
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,920
Exactly.

2021
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,440
You just went from 52 to 58 in the last five seconds.

2022
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,440
Awesome.

2023
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,440
Thank you guys.

2024
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,440
So there you go.

2025
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:58,000
It may come in here worth it.

2026
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,040
No, appreciate having you here.

2027
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:03,640
And now we'll get that kind of response over on USL, you know.

2028
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,400
Hey, you guys should listen to us all right now.

2029
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,400
Oh, wait.

2030
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,720
There's podcasts to listen to that.

2031
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,520
I know, go listen.

2032
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,160
Go start downloading right now.

2033
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,960
Late breaking news as we get into part B tonight.

2034
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,580
We're going to get into some video game news, but Loki, you were mentioning some late breaking

2035
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:26,160
news just before we went live tonight, and this has to do with music games.

2036
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:30,680
This is so big, I don't know how we didn't have it in the show before the news even came

2037
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,680
out.

2038
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:36,320
Ubisoft has announced their next big music franchise.

2039
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,320
That's right.

2040
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,920
You've got to wonder, how the fuck are they going to follow up Michael Jackson?

2041
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:48,360
I mean, Michael Jackson, the king of pop, one of the greatest pop icons in the world.

2042
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:52,040
On the anniversary of his death, nonetheless.

2043
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,640
How possibly can we honor such...

2044
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,000
How we go beyond that?

2045
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Who is actually...

2046
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Who will carry the torch?

2047
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,520
Who will carry the torch?

2048
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:07,480
And I am proud to announce the Black Eyed Peas will unfortunately carry the torch.

2049
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:15,520
Yeah, so Black Eyed Peas Experience, ah, I can't even say that.

2050
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:24,080
That will be coming out to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii soon.

2051
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,560
I see, so what would the Black Eyed Peas Experience consist of?

2052
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,380
Just a bunch of shitty sampling?

2053
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:38,560
I got a feeling that this game's gonna suck my ball sack at this...

2054
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,560
I have to repeat this.

2055
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,560
What?

2056
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:45,520
Tigerclaw said, and the only way to get Jessica back on OLR would be to have us contact her

2057
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,520
agent.

2058
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,520
I know, right?

2059
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,680
Then next year it'll be Jessica the Experience, but that would be better than the Black Eyed

2060
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,620
Peas Experience, that's for sure.

2061
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,080
Is anyone excited about the Black Eyed Peas Experience?

2062
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,080
No.

2063
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,880
I'm sorry, I completely was ignoring all of that.

2064
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,880
I'm sorry they're jacking my style.

2065
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,640
Although I did see the best headline ever, can I share this with you guys?

2066
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,880
Hold on, I put it on my Tumblr.

2067
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,620
I don't talk about my Tumblr a lot because it makes me feel very hipster, but it's my

2068
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:15,620
favorite thing that I've posted on Tumblr.

2069
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,240
Are you drinking PBR?

2070
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,240
In like a week.

2071
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,240
I think you're okay then.

2072
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:25,000
Here's the picture, it's a headline in a tabloid, it says, Fergie isn't pregnant, just really

2073
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
likes tacos.

2074
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,080
Now that's an experience I can get done with.

2075
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:34,720
I'm reposting that right now.

2076
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,880
That's what Tumblr's all about, I reposted it from Alan.

2077
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,600
Let me post that, can I post that, how do I post that in chat?

2078
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,600
You just copy...

2079
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,600
Copy link location.

2080
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,600
Yeah.

2081
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,600
There you go.

2082
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,600
There you go.

2083
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,600
Hooked on internet, worked for him.

2084
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,600
I think I might have put an extra slash at the end there, try that.

2085
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,600
Alright.

2086
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:02,200
So let's just pop in our chat room, it's just- What the hell did...

2087
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:11,200
There will be no tumbling during the show, stop.

2088
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,200
You post that in chat.

2089
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,080
I officially adore your boyfriend.

2090
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:20,680
Is that an anteater face, I can't quite- It's like a little mermaid, it's a little

2091
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,720
mermaid meets Cyrano.

2092
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,880
Oh no, no.

2093
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:31,160
Well speaking of salacious pop in our chat room, he's reacting to the Black Eyed Peas

2094
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:36,040
Experience News saying, OMG, I'm like Regina George when she spit out the Cal teen bar

2095
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,240
and screeched in Mean Girls.

2096
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:46,720
Anyhow, hey, we have spinoff shows, like I imagine you love Orange Lounge Radio so much

2097
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,320
you want to listen to some other shows.

2098
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:52,360
I mean we've plugged the shit out of Undersedation Live certainly, but Dark Soccer and I do some

2099
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,280
other shows too we want you to know about.

2100
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,280
Dark Soccer?

2101
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:59,560
I do a podcast about comics where we don't really talk about comics that much anymore.

2102
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,560
Because guess what?

2103
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,640
The comic industry is lame right now.

2104
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:10,040
But it's me and Tiara as Mar and Marvel, I almost said Marvin.

2105
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,040
Marvin Morrill.

2106
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,080
I'm going to blow you up.

2107
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,480
My space modulator.

2108
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,480
I am Marvin the Marvel.

2109
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,600
No, I almost said Marvin Morrill.

2110
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,320
And that just brings me straight to...

2111
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:29,960
NERF 4!

2112
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,160
Inside jokes for the win.

2113
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,680
Marvin Marvel.

2114
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,800
And Dan Shadow.

2115
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:43,280
And we, if you have anyone up on Tuesday, we are at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net

2116
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,560
and we want email eventually.

2117
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,200
People email us please.

2118
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,320
Because I don't have to read them, Tiara has to read them.

2119
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,480
Make Tiara read your emails.

2120
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,280
And also we have Twitter.

2121
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:05,800
It's Comic Insanity, the letter N, not an I-N, on Twitter.

2122
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:11,780
If you like the World of Warcraft and you want to hear a show more obscene than this

2123
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:18,320
one, check out the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, Hoardhouse.com.

2124
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:23,920
This week's show we had our buddy Sil, who is originally from Amsterdam but she now lives

2125
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,800
in Britain.

2126
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,540
Not the London part, she lives in not London, we call it.

2127
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:35,500
And this week we got her to talk about ERP and an ERP story that will shock you.

2128
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,000
So yep, we're going to get into all that on Hoardhouse.

2129
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Hoardhouse.com.

2130
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
ERP.

2131
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
It's awesome.

2132
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Also.

2133
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
What?

2134
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,520
There will be more stuff coming.

2135
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,800
More podcasts.

2136
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,320
You and your crypto stuff-o.

2137
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,160
Well, you're in on it.

2138
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,680
You're helping out, shit.

2139
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,680
I disavow all knowledge.

2140
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,560
Yeah, can we just skip the dwarven hand cannons please?

2141
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:01,920
And DJ Morpheus always there to remind me in a who's your daddy kind of way.

2142
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,480
Rob, Understation Live is not a spinoff, it's your father, bitch.

2143
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,800
That's why we didn't plug it just then.

2144
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,800
Oh.

2145
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,080
He just wants you to get off his lawn.

2146
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,080
Alright.

2147
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,360
Anyhow, let's move on.

2148
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,600
Waving his cane at you.

2149
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,640
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

2150
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:22,880
Some stories that we want to get through quickly because we want to spend more time not talking

2151
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:23,880
about video games.

2152
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,480
Loki, what do you got for us?

2153
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,480
Ah, yes.

2154
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:32,100
Since we were talking a little bit about music games before, I figured we might as well talk

2155
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,060
about Rock Band.

2156
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:42,120
At Rock Band, getting some new download content in the form of Poison Pack 1, featuring three

2157
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:49,260
songs by Poison, including Nothing But a Good Time, Talk Dirty to Me, and Unskinny Bop.

2158
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:57,480
And that's going to be $2 each, or 160 Microsoft points, or $5.49 for the whole pack, or 440

2159
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,480
Microsoft points.

2160
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,040
Whereas my every rose has a thorn.

2161
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,440
Sorry, that's not...

2162
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:07,120
And then also, of course, Three Doors Down, there's going to be a pack for them with the

2163
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:12,440
songs Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and When You're Young.

2164
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:16,800
Each of those $2, and you know, $5.49 for the whole pack.

2165
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,280
And then of course, if that's not exactly your taste, you may check out the Rock Band

2166
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:27,160
Network, where there's been a pretty neat addition.

2167
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:31,880
They added Pac-Man Fever, among a bunch of other tracks.

2168
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,880
Pac-Man Fever.

2169
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,480
I was going to say, just a really quick side note, it's funny you mention every rose has

2170
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,480
its thorn, Jamie.

2171
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,800
That was my first slow dance ever.

2172
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,420
Really, in 8th grade.

2173
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,640
But guess what?

2174
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:50,440
It's not just Pac-Man Fever, because the Buckner and Garcias also have Mouse Trap, Hyperspace,

2175
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:54,600
and Froggy's Lament on the Rock Band Network.

2176
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:55,600
Each of those two bucks.

2177
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,640
But not doing the Donkey Kong.

2178
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:01,720
No, I'm sorry.

2179
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,840
And let's see here.

2180
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:09,120
Other than Rock Band, some stuff coming to LA Noire, or I should say LA Noire is coming

2181
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,520
to PC's this fall.

2182
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,560
They're going to be doing, you know, kind of the Rockstar thing, improving the graphics

2183
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,760
a little bit and adding 3D support as well.

2184
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,600
That'll be coming out this fall, and I guess this fall is when I expect that we can hack

2185
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:26,960
the crap out of that, because usually it takes the PC version to be able to break it open

2186
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,720
on both console and PC.

2187
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,720
Awesome.

2188
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:36,600
And then finally, you better get on this quick if you're a Sonic fan, the Sonic Generations

2189
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:41,040
demo is out now, but it will only be live for 20 days.

2190
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:47,760
And actually, it's 20 days actually earlier.

2191
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:57,680
So it will be running I guess from now through July 28th, and you can check it out on Xbox

2192
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,480
Live Marketplace or the Playstation Network.

2193
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:07,520
And also kind of going with that if you're in the Japanese region or have a jailbroken

2194
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:14,600
phone or device, you can check out the iOS app that's available through the Japanese

2195
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:22,400
app store, and it includes Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 and a minigame called Sonic the

2196
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:28,080
Sketchhog as well as a news feed and weekly wallpaper downloads.

2197
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:34,240
Sorry, I got distracted.

2198
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,200
Fucking Tumblr, I swear to God.

2199
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,200
What?

2200
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,960
No, Tumblr is banned during the show.

2201
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,040
This is the best one ever though.

2202
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,600
Just look at Alan's Tumblr.

2203
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,480
He posts the craziest shit.

2204
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:50,960
Today I will get shit done by visitor LLLNOPE Tumbler.

2205
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,120
Alright, moving on.

2206
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,400
I'll show the chatroom.

2207
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,840
Hey, this is serious news you guys.

2208
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:05,720
Yu Suzuki has revealed in a Gamasutra interview, he is leaving his management position at AM2,

2209
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,960
which is, you know, he will be, it's part of his company that develops games.

2210
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:16,000
He will be at Sega as an advisor, but he will be kind of leaving his more management roles.

2211
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
So there you go.

2212
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Do you see this?

2213
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,240
Dan and Yu Suzuki.

2214
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:23,600
So how does that make you feel as such a Yu Suzuki fan?

2215
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:29,880
This was E3 like seven years ago.

2216
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,200
He looks so young.

2217
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:35,580
Are you sad or are you just like, oh, well, you know, these things happen?

2218
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:42,680
As long as he's still, as long as his great influence will still be upon Sega, Sega will

2219
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,320
never really die.

2220
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:51,160
Well in more news, you can file next to Duh and of course PopCap, who in an unrelated

2221
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:57,040
story, has, I guess, rumors going around that somebody wants to buy PopCap for $1 billion.

2222
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,040
Please don't be Activision.

2223
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:01,240
But yeah, apparently PopCap might be sold for $1 billion.

2224
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,800
That actually isn't the story I was going to say.

2225
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:07,880
Duh and of course Bejeweled 3 is coming to consoles.

2226
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,880
Hey Rob.

2227
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:09,880
What?

2228
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,960
You know who's rumored to be buying PopCap, right?

2229
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,480
I heard it was EA.

2230
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,480
Zynga.

2231
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,480
Oh God.

2232
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,480
Sheez.

2233
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,480
Barf.

2234
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:22,480
Speaking of Sega and Zynga, I was driving home from San Francisco last night and as

2235
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:26,640
I got on the freeway, I drove by the old Sega building that now has the Zynga logo on it.

2236
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:29,640
I cried.

2237
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:36,760
Bejeweled 3 on the DS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in the last quarter of 2011, of course

2238
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,480
you know that Bejeweled 3 is coming.

2239
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,840
And one of these games, you better get it or else it's going to be gone.

2240
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,720
And this was kind of a big one, TMNT.

2241
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,840
That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the hipsters.

2242
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,280
TMNT re-shelled.

2243
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,440
It will no longer be available after June 30th.

2244
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,980
This is your last chance to buy it.

2245
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,040
It will be gone in a few days time.

2246
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,620
This has to do with licensing.

2247
01:50:57,620 --> 01:51:01,000
It's not that it's getting delisted because it sucks.

2248
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,320
Which I don't even know if any games ever really were delisted because they suck.

2249
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,860
Usually it's a license thing.

2250
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:10,660
But if you want to get TMNT re-shelled, which was the arcade game but kind of redone graphics

2251
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:13,720
and so forth, get it now.

2252
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,720
Or never get it.

2253
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:16,920
Those are your choices.

2254
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,800
Dark Sakura's got some rapid fire news for us.

2255
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,560
Then we'll get to the Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash OLR.

2256
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:26,220
Well this should make a lot of fanboys, you know, need new panties.

2257
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:30,560
New Dragon Age 2 download content is going to be available.

2258
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,560
Five achievements.

2259
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:37,680
There's actually no new, no price on it quite yet, but the achievements will be for a total

2260
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,400
of 120 points.

2261
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:44,880
That is conduct or defeat an ancient evil in the Denmark mountains.

2262
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,740
Deep root safari, kill a bunch of stuff.

2263
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:50,960
Family legacy, apply three effects to Hawk's Key.

2264
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,360
Family outing, that's the main quest in the mountains with Bethany or Carver in the party.

2265
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:58,920
And towns, you know, actually I got Carver killed and didn't really give a shit about

2266
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,140
Bethany.

2267
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:06,880
And tower sweeper, where you do every side quest in the mountain prison tower.

2268
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:14,300
Then there's actually a public monument being made to Gary Gygax, who is one of the creators

2269
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,120
of D&D.

2270
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:20,200
And it is in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

2271
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:25,280
It better be a huge mungus D20.

2272
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,240
And it better be a natural 20.

2273
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:31,920
It better be a 12-sider, because dude, it's all about playing warrior class.

2274
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,320
I'm kidding, I played mages.

2275
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:40,640
And last but never least, more Wii U news.

2276
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:46,800
Every single time somebody says that, I always hear in my head the chick from Kung Pao.

2277
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,800
Of course.

2278
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:55,560
Anyway, Masahiro Sakurai is basically quoted as saying that another Smash Brothers game

2279
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:59,480
is years away for Wii U and 3DS.

2280
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:03,880
They're putting all of their effort into Kid Icarus Uprising.

2281
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:11,460
And he said that it makes him cringe that he's got more projects on his plate.

2282
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,460
What makes him cringe?

2283
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:15,700
The fact that they're announcing games like five years before they're coming out.

2284
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,260
Is that the part that makes him cringe?

2285
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:20,920
The fact that he's, I don't know, just putting his credibility online.

2286
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:23,880
Hey, by the way, we're going to have a new Mario game.

2287
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,560
Mario's going to come out and be alive in your house.

2288
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,840
Oh, that's not coming out for 50 years though.

2289
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,460
The quote, it makes me cringe that I'm not sure it's the smartest thing to make gamers

2290
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,160
wait for several years.

2291
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:39,440
But the early announcement was made chiefly in order to attract new team members.

2292
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,700
We've got no plans whatsoever, we've got two new games out there in the open when there's

2293
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,680
no extra time to work on them all.

2294
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:48,200
So basically he's being pretty upfront about it, saying, I don't know why they told you

2295
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,820
all this early, but here you go.

2296
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:52,280
To attracting new team members.

2297
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,280
Apparently they need work.

2298
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,320
Well, there's people over here who don't have jobs who can design pretty well, and I'll

2299
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,120
design your manual for you if you pay me a lot.

2300
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:02,840
I would think that they would be able to put that up on, I don't know, a job posting or

2301
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:08,480
something like that instead of saying, hey, fans of, hey, guess what, fans of Smash Brothers.

2302
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,740
There's a game coming.

2303
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:12,840
Would you rather have someone working on a project that actually cares about the project

2304
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,920
or somebody who's just worried about throwing out crap?

2305
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:20,200
Well, I would have, I'd rather they care about it, but also rather they, I don't know, don't

2306
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,600
announce it before you have even started the game.

2307
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:24,800
I think it was more- It's an inevitability anyway.

2308
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,800
I was about to say the same thing, I was thinking more in the name of inevitability, new Nintendo

2309
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:32,440
console, yeah, of course, we're going to put our new Smash Brothers, but we'll do it later.

2310
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,720
Hypothetically, games that are going to be coming out then.

2311
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:38,160
I mean, since they're out there- Microsoft did it too.

2312
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:41,720
They announced Alan Wake with the 360 five years later.

2313
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,920
Okay, but it was probably in development.

2314
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:48,800
It wasn't something that they said, eh, well, you know, there's a difference between delay,

2315
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:53,960
delay, delay, and the difference between, yeah, well, we haven't really started the

2316
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,960
game yet.

2317
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,560
I mean- It's just, so we wrote it down on a piece of paper.

2318
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,560
You know it's coming out.

2319
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,560
You know we're going to.

2320
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,560
We just haven't started on it.

2321
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,220
Hey, wouldn't you guys like a Smash Brothers game on the 3DS?

2322
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:05,440
We would too.

2323
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,920
So that's why we're going to work on one someday.

2324
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:15,960
It's like, that's what Nintendo was announcing at E3, shit that they don't even have started

2325
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:16,960
yet.

2326
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,600
They're probably on the drive in or walking up on it and saying, hey, you know what, we

2327
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:23,720
should tell them that there's a new Smash Brothers coming out.

2328
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:24,720
Yeah.

2329
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:32,520
All right, let's get to some Twitter topics, twitter.com slash o-l-r, tweet, tweet, tweet,

2330
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,520
every week.

2331
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:39,200
We need you here every week just for that part.

2332
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:44,000
Every week you guys send us tweets, but only tonight we'll just sing.

2333
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,200
Twitter.com slash o-l-r, we have a handful of tweets tonight.

2334
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:52,040
I want to start tonight with a completely random tweet from Flaming Toilet who sends

2335
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:58,480
us a tweet that's a retweet from Agent M. Behold, the 25th anniversary DVD collection

2336
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:04,280
of the Golden Girls and we get linked to a post on Yes Tumblers, which is I guess this

2337
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:08,120
Golden Girls collection that comes in a gigantic purse.

2338
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:13,560
It's all seven seasons on DVD with a deck of playing cards as well.

2339
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,160
Better come with like a gift certificate to Cheesecake Factory.

2340
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,160
When's that coming out?

2341
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,160
Soon.

2342
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:19,160
I don't know.

2343
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:20,160
I didn't see the date.

2344
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,300
I would think that Applebee's would be more appropriate.

2345
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,440
But I loved Flaming Toilet's comment.

2346
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:28,320
Now if we could just get them to include an official game in that box set.

2347
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,320
Yeah.

2348
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,320
I'm hoping.

2349
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:34,040
And don't forget about maybe having the first season of Golden Palace.

2350
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,040
Oh God.

2351
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,040
Do you remember that?

2352
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:37,040
Yeah.

2353
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,040
Oh, they linked it to Amazon.

2354
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,040
Oh, gee.

2355
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,040
The low, low price of 182 bucks.

2356
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,040
Geez.

2357
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,040
Let's see.

2358
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,040
When is it out?

2359
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,040
That is still cheaper than Deep Space Nine for the record.

2360
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,040
It's out.

2361
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,040
I don't know.

2362
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,040
That's a lot of Betty White.

2363
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,040
It's out now.

2364
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,040
In stock.

2365
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Buy it now.

2366
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,040
It's my birthday.

2367
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,040
Just saying.

2368
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,040
All right.

2369
01:56:55,040 --> 01:57:00,680
Moving on, let's see, going to S2 100 Matt.

2370
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:07,920
A guy is shipping himself 2,000 plus miles in a crate while playing Lord of the Rings

2371
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:08,920
online.

2372
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,500
Surprisingly for a good cause too.

2373
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,800
This might be relevant to Jessica's interests.

2374
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,040
Yeah, exactly.

2375
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:19,480
Yeah, we were just talking earlier about shipping Drunami in a crate.

2376
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:20,480
Which server, dammit.

2377
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,480
There he is.

2378
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,640
He's in a crate playing on a PC there.

2379
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,320
That is not comfortable looking.

2380
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,320
What's his name?

2381
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:34,160
Performance artist, Jordan Wayne Long, starting on July 7th, he will be confined to a small

2382
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:35,420
wooden box.

2383
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:42,260
He's being shipped from Bald Knob, Arkansas.

2384
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:43,260
He's going to...

2385
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,880
And we're back to the penis joke.

2386
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:48,800
Being all alone in that box, he's going to have a Bald Knob by the time he's done.

2387
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:53,000
Well, you know, there's only so much you can do during, you know, but it is summer festival,

2388
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,620
so...

2389
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:56,800
You're going to get bored of Lord of the Rings online eventually.

2390
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,240
A man's got needs.

2391
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,680
Bald Knob, Arkansas to Portland, Oregon.

2392
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,880
Just picture him finding some cute little elf.

2393
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:04,880
It will be...

2394
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:05,880
Oh yeah.

2395
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:06,880
Oh yeah.

2396
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:07,880
He'll be...

2397
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:11,920
He'll have to find which port to put his Bald Knob in.

2398
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,720
Why the fuck is he doing it?

2399
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:16,460
The reasons apparently are mixed.

2400
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:19,520
He wants to provide entertainment through his Twitter account.

2401
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,120
He also aims to better understand post-traumatic stress disorder.

2402
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,520
Many individuals who experienced traumatic events...

2403
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,520
What?

2404
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:28,520
Is this a joke?

2405
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:29,520
Are you going to tell me this is a hoax?

2406
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,520
No, no.

2407
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,520
It's not a hoax.

2408
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,520
Here's why he's doing it.

2409
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,200
Attention whore is why he's doing it.

2410
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:35,200
Because he's a poor artist.

2411
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:40,720
I'm doing an art project where I'm going to ship myself in a container and play Lord of

2412
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,720
the Rings.

2413
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:43,400
It worked.

2414
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:50,780
How is being in a shipping container while having entertainment, and at least you have

2415
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:56,060
one luxury, how is that causing PTSD in any way, shape, or form?

2416
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:57,960
How are you going to have post-traumatic stress disorder?

2417
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,800
He's playing Lord of the Rings online.

2418
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:06,560
If you want to get PTSD, why don't you play Black Eyed Peas The Experience?

2419
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,520
I don't get this.

2420
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:13,100
I hope they put him in one of those shipping containers up in the airplanes where they

2421
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:18,160
have no oxygen and sub-zero freezing temperatures and he freezes to death.

2422
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,160
That's what I hope happens to this guy.

2423
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:21,960
He freezes to death.

2424
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:26,240
I wish him death by freezing.

2425
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,040
Now if that does happen, you're going to feel a little bad.

2426
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,040
No, I'm not.

2427
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,040
I'm going to laugh.

2428
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,040
I'm going to laugh.

2429
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:36,240
I'm on the record right now saying I will laugh my ass off for at least five minutes.

2430
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:43,360
Maybe to break it to you, but I don't think there's any major airports in Bald Knob.

2431
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,360
If there was.

2432
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:45,360
Yes, there is.

2433
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:46,640
Bald Knob International.

2434
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,560
I don't think anybody could ever take it seriously if they had to take a flight from there.

2435
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:53,720
They have flights every day to Toronto and Guadalajara.

2436
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:57,160
The views expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those of all the staff

2437
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:00,160
of Orange Lawns Radio.

2438
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,760
Right?

2439
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:08,080
And Frisbee says that can't be more than a four to five hour flight.

2440
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,000
Dude, he's shipping himself UPS.

2441
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
That's the problem.

2442
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
That's why it's going to take seven days.

2443
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,520
He's going to get lost, dumped in the ocean, you know.

2444
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:17,920
They'll leave him on some back porch somewhere.

2445
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,920
Hold on.

2446
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:19,920
Hold on.

2447
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:22,220
So why is he able to ship himself via, you know, UPS?

2448
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:23,680
Because I'm pretty sure they have policies against him.

2449
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:26,640
I don't know how he's shipping himself, but I just assumed it was UPS.

2450
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:27,640
Old Dominion.

2451
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:31,840
So I hope they're shipping him because they will lose that package.

2452
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,000
Alright.

2453
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,360
Tiger Claw links us to some stories here real quick.

2454
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,440
Remember GeoHot?

2455
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,440
That's right.

2456
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:45,720
The man behind the Sony PlayStation debacle when Sony was going to sue him.

2457
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:48,600
Probably the whole reason why Sony got hacked a couple months ago.

2458
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:51,440
Apparently, he's come out of this okay.

2459
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:54,360
He's got a development gig now at Facebook.

2460
02:00:54,360 --> 02:01:00,320
Yeah, this was, I guess, validated by a group called Techmeme.

2461
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,320
I don't know.

2462
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:06,560
But they tweeted a link to his private Facebook wall, which apparently called Facebook an

2463
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,840
amazing place to work.

2464
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:11,600
So it'll be interesting to see what he cooks up over at Facebook.

2465
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:15,960
Also, one other link here from Tiger Claw on Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

2466
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,080
Gameplay Theater Festival.

2467
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,920
Speaking of performance art, here we go.

2468
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:24,020
It combines gaming and performance art.

2469
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:27,600
If you're in Brooklyn, oh God, haven't these guys done this shit before?

2470
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:31,700
I remember a Brooklyn theater and something about gaming.

2471
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,880
But the Brick Theater is going to be doing gameplay.

2472
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:39,520
It's a theater festival comprised of gaming-oriented stage productions, musical performances, and

2473
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,880
interactive performance art.

2474
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:42,880
Let's see.

2475
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,080
There's Romeo and Julietette.

2476
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,700
It's a modern interpretation of Shakespeare's classic.

2477
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:51,960
It will be performed entirely within World of Warcraft.

2478
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:59,000
Modal Kombat uses real guitars to control Mortal Kombat characters.

2479
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,280
There's a YouTube.

2480
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,280
I could play it.

2481
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,500
Why don't they actually do a good Shakespeare play?

2482
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:07,600
Or I could go to the last tweet tonight from ActDeft.

2483
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:08,600
Here's a good question.

2484
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:10,640
A question for our nine-year anniversary show.

2485
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,000
I like this.

2486
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:18,640
What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?

2487
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:22,880
What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?

2488
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,080
I'll start with Loki.

2489
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:25,080
He's opinionated.

2490
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:28,200
I don't know.

2491
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,200
Come back to me.

2492
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,200
I'll think about this.

2493
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,200
Dark Sakura?

2494
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:36,280
Nothing's really surprising, you know?

2495
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:42,720
It's anything that's exciting is cyclic because they're always, it's always going to be, I

2496
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:46,720
read them on E3, all this stuff, blah, blah, blah, and then all of this blah, blah, blah.

2497
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,340
So it really is going to go in a cycle.

2498
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:51,160
It's nothing stays really crazy.

2499
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:58,080
I guess the monumental news of the whole nine years is that I'd like WoW now.

2500
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:02,160
The most impactful news of the past, well, let me go to the guests first before I say

2501
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:03,160
my opinion.

2502
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:04,160
Anybody?

2503
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:05,160
Jiranami?

2504
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,160
No?

2505
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,160
Jess Carper passing?

2506
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,160
I don't know.

2507
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,160
Anything you guys didn't think of?

2508
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,300
I'm going to go along with Jamie's line of thinking of, oh my goodness, I'm actually

2509
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:16,040
playing an MMO, which for anybody who knows me is pretty shocking.

2510
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:19,720
Maybe the advent of the MMO, if you will, over the past nine years.

2511
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:24,560
I mean, granted Ultima online is a little bit over nine years old, but maybe the mainstreaming

2512
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:29,560
of the MMO, it really, it would definitely be in the top five, I think for me.

2513
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:33,360
It really, it really did like, and I've said so on the show before, but I've used to play

2514
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:38,320
Gemstone back in the day when it was on AOL and you had to pay to play Gemstone when you

2515
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:40,000
had to pay to do AOL by the hour.

2516
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,800
See, my first, when I first started into tech support and the whole IT world, I was surrounded

2517
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:47,940
by guys who were playing EverQuest.

2518
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:50,680
So that was all I ever heard about was EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest.

2519
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:54,800
And it was because of them that I swore off any kind of MMO ever.

2520
02:03:54,800 --> 02:04:00,120
And here I am many, many, many, many years later and I'm addicted to Lotro.

2521
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:03,000
So I don't know.

2522
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:10,120
For me, the most impacting Xbox Live is the biggest story I think that's happened in nine

2523
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:11,120
years.

2524
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:17,000
It took the Xbox particularly seriously until Xbox Live changed console gaming and not only

2525
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,960
changed console gaming, it killed arcades.

2526
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:24,160
And it changed the way we commune as a community.

2527
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:27,920
And it's, you know, been imitated by other places.

2528
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:33,240
I think Xbox Live, it's part of the reason we have what, Dark Soccer's favorite word

2529
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,160
microtransactions now is because of Xbox Live.

2530
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:39,960
Xbox Live, I think is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years.

2531
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:45,280
And I'm still thinking just the whole really pushing the internet too.

2532
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,800
How long do you think it'll actually be before they just give up on the concept of arcades

2533
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:49,800
altogether?

2534
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:54,780
I don't think they ever will because the ticket gambling things will always be there.

2535
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:59,000
And I think there will always be a pinball machine in a bar.

2536
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,440
Well, at the same time though, just while I was going through Roseville Golf Land, I

2537
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:09,360
always make notes when I see new tick redemption games as well.

2538
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,320
And there were only one or two.

2539
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:15,080
It seems like even those are starting to slow down a little bit.

2540
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:19,680
However Pachinko in Japan is still big.

2541
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:23,600
The most surprising for me is kind of a tie.

2542
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:26,760
I would say the Nintendo Wii.

2543
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:29,860
Just the fact that Nintendo did it.

2544
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:36,280
They had a vision and they were right and love them or hate them for it, they did it.

2545
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:40,200
And the rise of Facebook games I think is very surprising.

2546
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:43,640
Farmville might be the most surprising thing of the past nine years.

2547
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:46,360
Again, love it or hate it, your grandma's playing it.

2548
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:52,960
I have to go with the fact that Nintendo had this neat system that they developed called

2549
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,200
the Revolution.

2550
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:56,840
And at the last minute they thought, hey, you know what's a better name?

2551
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:01,580
Wii.

2552
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:03,640
And also Giant Enemy Crabs.

2553
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:05,040
Some of the chatters disagree with me.

2554
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:09,080
I can't see how Xbox Live killed arcade gaming because you didn't have to leave the house

2555
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:10,580
to go be with other people.

2556
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:11,580
That's why I say that.

2557
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:16,080
I mean, granted, it's one of several things that probably led to that.

2558
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:20,100
But I think it made that whole community gaming, you didn't have to really leave the house

2559
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:21,100
to do it.

2560
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:24,360
And that goes right hand in hand with the whole internet MMO thing.

2561
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:27,320
I think those are closely married together.

2562
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:32,200
Just thinking back to the way things used to be, the arcade used to be a place that

2563
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:34,160
people would go to hang out.

2564
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:38,960
Even before when, you know, we were actively playing as a group at Roseville Golf Land

2565
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,000
and what have you back in the day.

2566
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,520
Earlier than that, you know, people were like, there's, at Birdcage Center, this is a place

2567
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:50,520
that we used to have a Rocky at, they had an arcade.

2568
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:55,980
It was one of the best and it was the thing to do was you would hang out and you would

2569
02:06:55,980 --> 02:07:00,740
either go to the bowling alley, to the movies, or you would be hanging out in the arcade.

2570
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:07,360
And it was the social, basically the social mecca of that entire area.

2571
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:14,760
So I think that essentially the internet and all of, you know, the MMOs, Xbox Live, what

2572
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:19,000
have you, all of that has really, really led to the decline.

2573
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:24,320
I mean, it's nice to, you know, on a whim go to the arcade with your friends, but it's

2574
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:28,280
not someplace you're going to be spending every single night like we were back in our

2575
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:29,280
DDR days.

2576
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,000
It just doesn't happen.

2577
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Yeah.

2578
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,760
So, and again, folks in the chat room still disagreeing with me over Xbox Live killing

2579
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,760
arcade games.

2580
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,440
I'll give you that concession.

2581
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:41,600
It didn't single handedly do it, but I still stand by my answer.

2582
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:44,300
Xbox Live's the most important thing that happened in gaming in the past nine years.

2583
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:47,060
And again, the Xbox would have failed without it.

2584
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:50,680
People did not take the Xbox seriously until you played Halo 2 online for the first time.

2585
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:54,960
I mean, there was, of course, some people bought the system, but it did not take off

2586
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:55,960
until Xbox Live.

2587
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:01,840
And I think that really actually started, I think, from the Dreamcast, because a lot

2588
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,040
more online games for a console came out with the Dreamcast.

2589
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:09,600
We had Phantasy Star Online in Japan, which didn't support their broadband adapter over

2590
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:10,920
here, which was shitty.

2591
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,620
Quake 3.

2592
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:16,040
So many games started coming out toward the end of the Dreamcast Live that used the online

2593
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:17,040
support.

2594
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,720
But Xbox Live centralized it, and that was huge.

2595
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:19,720
Exactly.

2596
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:22,240
See, that's what I'm saying is that the concept was there.

2597
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:24,200
Sega was starting to push it, and you notice how quick...

2598
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,560
Xbox didn't invent it, they just perfected it.

2599
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,400
Oh, Microsoft's way of gaming.

2600
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,640
They don't think of it always, they just perfect it.

2601
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:37,280
But in Japan, they had the Satellaview for Super Nintendo, where you could play online

2602
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,600
games.

2603
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:40,960
And what was the thing called for the Genesis?

2604
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,960
The X-something.

2605
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:46,220
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2606
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:49,360
The online Genesis thing that they had?

2607
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:50,360
Sega Channel.

2608
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:51,360
Yeah, Sega Channel.

2609
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,840
But it was starting there.

2610
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:57,120
They had the right idea, and then I think it was just like, well, people are wanting

2611
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:58,120
to do this.

2612
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:00,120
Let's make it happen, and let's make it happen in a big way.

2613
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:01,600
And that's where Xbox came in.

2614
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:05,200
They basically took what everyone was thinking and like, okay, here.

2615
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:07,240
Yeah, I think Black Wolf sums it up pretty well.

2616
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:10,160
It didn't catch on with the Dreamcast, and it didn't catch on with Sega Channel.

2617
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:12,060
I mean, it was a great idea, but it didn't catch on.

2618
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:14,200
It needed Microsoft for the marketing.

2619
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:17,440
And you know, that centralization, I think, is again the key word there too.

2620
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,560
All right, let's move on past Twitter topics.

2621
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,240
Let's get into some more gaming news.

2622
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:24,760
We have some more stories for you guys, FUs of the Week coming up as well.

2623
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:27,000
At some point, we'll have a mailbag too.

2624
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:32,240
And then, of course, the calls, the Skypline at 1-877-GAME-OLR, but not just yet.

2625
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:33,240
First some stories.

2626
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:34,240
Loki.

2627
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:40,680
Yes, there's a class action lawsuit against Sony, of course, about the PlayStation Network

2628
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:42,160
outage.

2629
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:49,320
It is alleged, though, that part of this lawsuit is because they're saying that layoffs had

2630
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:53,400
an effect on the PlayStation Network making it vulnerable.

2631
02:09:53,400 --> 02:10:00,640
Apparently, it says that a Sony online entertainment platform engineer claims that Sony's technicians

2632
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:05,880
only installed firewalls on an ad hoc basis after they determined that a particular user

2633
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:10,680
was attempting to gain unauthorized access to the network.

2634
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:17,000
And it says also that, I guess, Sony spent lavishly on security measures for its own

2635
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,800
PlayStation dev network and didn't put the same effort or budget into securing users'

2636
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,800
data.

2637
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:28,400
Because they only seem to care about themselves.

2638
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:34,200
And also, I guess, that they enacted large-scale layoffs in March of this year, just weeks

2639
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:37,240
before the massive data breach.

2640
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:39,840
Hmm.

2641
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,320
That's a little coinkydink.

2642
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:52,480
Um, yeah, so there's a whole lot of not nice things that are going on there.

2643
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,520
I'm making Rob laugh.

2644
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:55,760
Tarzara's teaching me sign language.

2645
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,840
I thought I was going to say, no incur.

2646
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:01,320
Well, what do you think, though?

2647
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:04,280
Is this really to blame for why PlayStation Network went down?

2648
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:05,280
I don't know.

2649
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:08,160
I think just people really want to kick Sony while they're down, and this just seems a

2650
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,160
little bit like...

2651
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:12,880
I mean, if they're spending a lot of money and time to secure their other network that

2652
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:17,840
has stuff that's important to Sony, but yet the stuff that's important to their consumers,

2653
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:21,840
like I don't know their personal information, they just leave wide open, then yeah, that

2654
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:23,480
does sound like a problem to me.

2655
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:26,940
I think at the end of the day, you know what I always say on this show, hackers gonna hack.

2656
02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:34,120
And I think after everybody was very angered by the removal of Linux, I don't even think

2657
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:38,540
if they could have had the higher security facility in the world, they probably still

2658
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:40,240
would have found a way to get in there and hack it.

2659
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:41,240
You know?

2660
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,240
I just...

2661
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:43,240
I don't know.

2662
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,240
Not that it makes it right.

2663
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,880
Sony had every enemy in the world at that point.

2664
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:49,320
That's also like saying, you know, well, I left my doors unlocked in my house, so that's

2665
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:55,200
why I got robbed, you know, versus, oh, well, my house was locked up like Fort Knox and

2666
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:58,400
had a security alarm and all this stuff, and I got robbed.

2667
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:03,600
Well, you know, that kind of security does deter people from hacking.

2668
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:10,520
And you know, I mean, we can, you know, put out a bunch of what if scenarios out there

2669
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:15,600
for a whole, you know, bunch of things that they could have done, but they didn't do any

2670
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:18,400
of them, so we don't really need to.

2671
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:22,280
Stupidity in terms of security aside, you still don't blame the victim.

2672
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:24,860
All right.

2673
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:28,540
You can't say, oh, well, it's just, you know, why secure banks?

2674
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:30,080
Bank robbers are gonna rob banks.

2675
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:34,240
I mean, that's, that's dumb.

2676
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:35,240
All right.

2677
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,240
Well, let's move on.

2678
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:39,760
Uh, you know, there was a lot of talk about, uh, this whole halo connect thing.

2679
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:44,400
You remember the domain connect halo.com made everybody say, oh God, Microsoft's working

2680
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,800
on a halo game with connect.

2681
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:50,080
And then the halo anniversary edition was rumored, ultimately announced, and a lot of

2682
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:53,920
people assumed that it was going to have connect integration, but they didn't show it at E3.

2683
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:58,620
Well, apparently, uh, there is this whole, I guess, thing going around that there's a

2684
02:12:58,620 --> 02:13:05,400
better for connect, I guess, thing going on with, uh, the new halo game and, uh, Microsoft

2685
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:11,420
studios, Phil Spencer, who's the boss there, uh, mentioned with game spot as a first party.

2686
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:15,160
We believe that connect will be important to all genres of games.

2687
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:18,700
Even games like halo anniversary has connect integration.

2688
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:24,360
So you can say confirmed connect integration with halo anniversary, but it may not be what

2689
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:25,360
you think.

2690
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:30,560
There was a forum admin BS angel, like that name, uh, on the halo waypoint forums.

2691
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:35,240
Uh, one of the admins said about halo anniversary's connect integration, just to let everybody

2692
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:40,040
know the connect features we're exploring with halo anniversary are optional and won't

2693
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:42,720
affect your core gameplay experience.

2694
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:47,660
Our mission from day one has been to deliver a faithful recreation of the original game.

2695
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:50,920
And we remain dedicated to seeing that through to completion.

2696
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:54,520
This says to me that the connect stuff they're looking at integrating probably has nothing

2697
02:13:54,520 --> 02:14:00,840
to do with the game itself, but it's going to be like voice commands in the menus or

2698
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:03,160
I don't know, maybe using the connect to some microphone.

2699
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:09,000
So you can say obscenities to all the people on Xbox live from your couch or just little

2700
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,040
dumb things that will connect.

2701
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:17,000
No, I don't even think that just, or yeah, maybe a color for your outfit based on the

2702
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,400
actual shirt you're wearing.

2703
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,560
Just really stupid shit like that.

2704
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:22,120
That paint master chief.

2705
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,120
Yeah.

2706
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:29,240
And I think that's the type of stuff now we're looking at is literally things tacked on to

2707
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:31,160
just say, Hey, this game uses connect.

2708
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:34,560
You know, it would be neat to do a map editor using connect.

2709
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:39,280
Yeah, but I don't see a halo map editor happening period, but it just occurred to me that it

2710
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:44,520
would actually be cause you say move tree here because of forge member for just part

2711
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:49,040
of the, or you could just go play Minecraft.

2712
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,740
I had a nightmare about Minecraft.

2713
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:51,880
You had a nightmare about Minecraft?

2714
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:52,880
I sure did.

2715
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:55,440
Did the goblins get through to your house or any of that stuff?

2716
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:58,200
The goblins all had internet troll faces.

2717
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:00,200
I'm not even joking.

2718
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:03,280
Penis man in our chat room says, I don't care if they add connect to halo.

2719
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:06,920
As long as I can play it with just a controller as the halo lover I am.

2720
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:09,280
There you go.

2721
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,480
And black Wolf says face mapping under your helmet.

2722
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:13,520
It's technology.

2723
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:14,520
So good.

2724
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:18,200
You can't even tell it's there anyhow.

2725
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,480
Also real quick about halo.

2726
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:24,040
There is flaming helmets coming to halo reach.

2727
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,040
That's right.

2728
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:29,120
If you register on bungee.net or through the recently released iOS app, you have until

2729
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:35,600
the end of July 7th to get a flaming bungee head on fire, blue flame thing for halo reach.

2730
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:36,800
You can get that.

2731
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:41,080
And there's this cute little PSA they made about it from of course, red versus blue.

2732
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:44,680
So guess what, Jessica, I can play halo and be flaming.

2733
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:47,440
Hello, I'm flaming.

2734
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:50,200
I'm playing halo.

2735
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:53,720
It's fabulous.

2736
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:56,280
Dark Sakura, you have some news for us?

2737
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,280
I have mail.

2738
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,800
No, I've got news.

2739
02:15:58,800 --> 02:15:59,800
You have mail.

2740
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:00,800
Excuse me.

2741
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:01,800
Burn the mail.

2742
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:02,800
Okay.

2743
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:05,920
We got some birthday wishes in the mailbag.

2744
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:11,960
Bit.Trip Saga and Bit.Trip Complete are being done on the 3DS and Wii and will be out on

2745
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:15,080
the 13th of September in the US.

2746
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:18,120
But there's no European publisher yet.

2747
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:19,120
Sadness.

2748
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:22,880
But we'll have it here so everybody in Europe import it.

2749
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,480
Those Bit.Trip games won't go away at all.

2750
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:30,920
You know, like those Bit.Trip games have been coming out for like years and years, but a

2751
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:33,040
lot of them are pretty cool, I got to say.

2752
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:34,040
Bit.Be.Trippin?

2753
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:37,080
I like Bit.Trip Beat, even though they've released it like as many times as Bejeweled's

2754
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:40,000
been released on all these different platforms, but still kind of an eet game.

2755
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Bit.Be.Trippin.Beats?

2756
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Block Rockin' Beats.

2757
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,720
All right.

2758
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,200
Before we get to some more news.

2759
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,320
Oh, look, it's the mailbag music.

2760
02:16:49,320 --> 02:16:50,320
It must be time.

2761
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:51,320
Dang it.

2762
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:52,320
I almost closed, oh, I closed everything.

2763
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,320
My bad.

2764
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:54,840
I don't think so.

2765
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:56,240
Every week you guys send us emails.

2766
02:16:56,240 --> 02:17:00,320
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com and sometimes I remember to put it on the show roll because

2767
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,320
this is a show where every gamer has a voice, usually.

2768
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:05,320
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

2769
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:08,400
I know why you didn't do it because last week you read it and you thought that I might have

2770
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,680
laryngitis again this week.

2771
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:11,680
Well guess what?

2772
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,600
I did it out of consideration for you.

2773
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,680
Yeah, well.

2774
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:17,600
This is from Rabba.

2775
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:20,840
Here's one of the few stories that link games with less violence and crime.

2776
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:25,800
My take is, my take on this is, this is just a theory not scientific study.

2777
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:30,400
The only difference is they who, they can compare video game proliferation against the

2778
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:34,720
crime rates dropping by year, which is more objective data than the games cause violence

2779
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:40,920
wingnuts, which only seem to use handpicked data from poorly designed experiments.

2780
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:48,360
And this actually comes from BBC, which honestly, world news from BBC is probably one of the

2781
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:49,880
best sources to get it from.

2782
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:50,880
It's the BBC.

2783
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:55,200
Well, keep in mind, you want your dry news, you get it from the BBC.

2784
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,680
Without any of the, you know, sensationalism.

2785
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:02,160
Tonight on the BBC, blah blah blah, etc, etc.

2786
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,560
But I've covered this on the show before.

2787
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:05,560
I think I'm coming.

2788
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:06,560
Oh.

2789
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,560
Oh.

2790
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:08,560
Oh dear.

2791
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:11,200
Isn't it nice to have a penis?

2792
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:13,840
Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?

2793
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:19,640
In 19, okay, it says 1985 crack market recruits youngest sellers and it's a relatively low

2794
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:21,040
rate then.

2795
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:25,280
1991 peak murder rate, crack demand starts to fall.

2796
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:35,080
And it, it is actually, as of right now, the crime rate is lower for murder, that is, than

2797
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,680
it was in 1970.

2798
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:42,600
And it hit its peak in, I think, around 19, yeah, 1991, 1982.

2799
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:49,320
And that robbery rates are also just slightly higher than murder rates, but still far low

2800
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:51,520
what they were in 1970.

2801
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,440
And that's coming from the FBI.

2802
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:54,840
You know what that means, though, Rob.

2803
02:18:54,840 --> 02:19:00,120
You know, on Wall Street you're hearing, sell crack, sell crack, sell crack, sell crack.

2804
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,080
I'm posting a link to this in the chat room.

2805
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:06,840
But I've covered that on the station before, because there was actually someone who did

2806
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:12,720
an independent study using a number of different resources, including the FBI and various local

2807
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:16,560
police accounts that came to the same conclusion.

2808
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:19,160
Guess what came out in 1991?

2809
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:22,360
The NES, I do believe, in the United States.

2810
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,360
In 91?

2811
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:26,680
91, no, the Super Nintendo.

2812
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:28,120
Super Nintendo.

2813
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:32,720
Unfortunately crack will be on the rise again and it's all thanks to video games.

2814
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:36,020
Thanks to a new video game that's going to be coming out this holiday season.

2815
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:38,080
It's called Being Bobby Brown.

2816
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:39,080
Let's take a look at a clip.

2817
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:40,080
We got to live with stars.

2818
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:41,080
We got to live with the anthrax.

2819
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,080
Oh, you just watch too much TV.

2820
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,080
I'm a true American.

2821
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:44,080
I've been to jail before.

2822
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:45,080
That's American.

2823
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:46,080
Kiss my ass!

2824
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:47,080
You kiss my ass?

2825
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:48,080
Kiss my ass!

2826
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:49,080
Fucking love that song.

2827
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:50,080
Yeah, everybody.

2828
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,080
Bobby!

2829
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:52,080
And, uh.

2830
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:53,080
Bobby!

2831
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,080
Bobby!

2832
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,080
Bobby!

2833
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:56,080
Bobby!

2834
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:57,080
Bobby!

2835
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:58,080
Bobby!

2836
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,080
Bobby!

2837
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:00,080
Bobby!

2838
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:01,080
Bobby!

2839
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:02,080
Bobby!

2840
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,080
Bobby!

2841
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:10,400
Bobby! and I.

2842
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:13,400
Whitney Houston, the experience coming out.

2843
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:15,440
Where's my drugs?

2844
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:16,440
I'll tell you what.

2845
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:22,120
Whitney Houston, the experience would be better than Black Eyed Peas, the experience.

2846
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:23,120
I'm sorry.

2847
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:25,840
It would be, there's some of the experience there.

2848
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:26,840
That's for sure.

2849
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:30,120
Well, anyway, they're, they're attributing some of this to the Obama effect, meaning

2850
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:38,280
that they're saying that having a, a black president is better, uh, a better role model.

2851
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:41,200
Where's my Kurt Cobain experience?

2852
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,240
And then there's a fall in demand for crack.

2853
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:45,480
It'd be a short game.

2854
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:46,480
Smarter.

2855
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:49,360
Obama being president means there's less of a demand for crack.

2856
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:50,840
I'm going number by number.

2857
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,840
The story's reaching.

2858
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:55,560
Smarter, uh, policing.

2859
02:20:55,560 --> 02:21:03,160
Better tracking of numbers so that they can actually keep the flow of criminality down.

2860
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:07,120
Increased availability of legal abortion.

2861
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:11,680
And more criminals behind bars.

2862
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:17,360
Reducing of lead in gasoline is decreasing exposure to children, which is also contributing

2863
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:19,040
to a fall in violent crime.

2864
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:20,800
The Baby Boomers grew up.

2865
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,000
And video, okay, now this is it.

2866
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,160
This is the important one.

2867
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:27,160
Number nine, a study released last month suggested video games were keeping young people off

2868
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:30,360
the streets and therefore away from crime.

2869
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:36,200
Researchers in Texas working with the Center for European Economic Research said this incapacitation

2870
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:41,780
effect more than offset any direct impact the contents of games may have had in encouraging

2871
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:42,780
violent behavior.

2872
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:46,280
So what you're saying is then they're just too fat to go outside and kill each other?

2873
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:47,280
Pretty much.

2874
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,280
Too lazy.

2875
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:49,280
Nah.

2876
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:51,280
It's, it's, it's more that-

2877
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,360
I'd fucking kill you, but I'm feeling really high.

2878
02:21:55,360 --> 02:22:01,560
And also the last one on there, and actually I like this one, the proliferation of camera

2879
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:02,560
phones.

2880
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:07,320
Meaning, oop, someone's robbing the ATM.

2881
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:08,320
Snap.

2882
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:09,620
Just saying.

2883
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,620
Next email.

2884
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:11,620
Hey.

2885
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:12,620
It's pretty valid.

2886
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:18,200
And at least it's better supported than, you know, all those other, you know, games are

2887
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:19,600
making my kids rob me right here.

2888
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:24,720
And at the same time, the amateur porn market is thriving due to camera phones.

2889
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:28,000
Okay, this comes from Holly.

2890
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,560
Has there been anything on Microsoft's next console?

2891
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:35,120
Do you think they are just keeping it under wraps or that maybe they haven't made anything

2892
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,520
this time around?

2893
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:37,520
Under wraps.

2894
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,520
Maybe.

2895
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:41,240
I'd be kind of interested in seeing a portable from Microsoft.

2896
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:46,320
With the DS things have been coming out lately, I'm just not feeling Nintendo anymore.

2897
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:50,120
Nintendo seems to be focusing way too much on gimmicky things and way less on quality

2898
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:51,120
of games.

2899
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:55,760
No, not you, I'm sorry, I'm posing for a picture for two.

2900
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:56,760
Okay.

2901
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:01,080
My husband and I both recently got rid of our DS lights in all the games.

2902
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:04,400
He had just bought the new Pokemon game but got bored with it after a week since it's

2903
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:06,400
pretty much the same game all over again.

2904
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:09,200
Actually, we also gave away our Wii to my mom as well.

2905
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:11,060
She's using it to watch Netflix.

2906
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:14,100
But when our Xbox died, we freaked and ran immediately by another one.

2907
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:18,280
It's already Red Ringed once, didn't know if they'll cover it a second time.

2908
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:25,880
That's just saying, you know, we loaned out our Wii, but we've got three Xboxes now.

2909
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:33,120
As far as the new Xbox goes, there's gonna be tight-lid secret on that until at least

2910
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:37,580
next E3, maybe even one more, and it all has to do with not wanting to cannibalize sales

2911
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:39,760
of the current Xbox.

2912
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:43,040
Why would you buy an Xbox today with Kinect if you know something better is coming out

2913
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:44,040
next year?

2914
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:49,280
There's a lot of people incentive to wait, so I'm gonna say that's your number one reason.

2915
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,560
It's not, to be honest, that's not specific to Xbox.

2916
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:56,000
PlayStation 4 has been in development for years, I guarantee it.

2917
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,120
You're just not gonna hear about it for a little while, because they don't want to cannibalize

2918
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:00,580
the PlayStation 3.

2919
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:02,760
Such is how the game industry works.

2920
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:04,400
Good lord, people.

2921
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,400
Okay.

2922
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:06,920
Hey, OLR crew!

2923
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:10,560
AZHP here with congratulations and salutations for another year of OLR.

2924
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:15,160
I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate your birthday and your roots than an addition

2925
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,160
of Where Are They Now?

2926
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:18,280
Bay Area DVR Players.

2927
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:25,780
FanaMacon was, a few weeks ago, Milton, Maple, and Gary, who was Shintengi, practically run

2928
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:27,000
the show and I love them for it.

2929
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,240
Wendell is a trooper and ran Stage Zero day and night to keep folks in the convention

2930
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,240
center entertained.

2931
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:36,520
And speaking of Stage Zero, the DS players, a dance crew formed mostly of old DVR freestylers,

2932
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:38,600
took the stage and blew everyone away.

2933
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:45,760
No longer satisfied to dance on panels in time to arrows the likes of AJ Sweetbanana,

2934
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:51,000
John Chaos, James Captain Canada, Lawrence Fuzzyhat, and many more cosplayed as random

2935
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,840
completely non-anime related characters like Jesus, Jackie Chan, The Terminator, and Tigger

2936
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:59,840
while popping, locking, and breakdancing to the tunes of 8-bit remixes and old school

2937
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:00,840
funk.

2938
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:04,560
They put on an amazing show and they inspire me to become a better dancer.

2939
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:08,360
There was still stepping on arrows to be had as Jonas Explicit, who's been on the show

2940
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:15,560
quite a few times, who now runs the Big Anime Game Room, or Teabagger for short, at most

2941
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:20,000
Bay Area conventions, hosted a DVR freestyle tournament to try and relive the good old

2942
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
days.

2943
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,320
To prove that freestyle is dead, no one cared if you failed or even hit the arrows because

2944
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:30,200
no one here remembers how to dance and step on arrows at the same time.

2945
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:33,560
Bruce Leroy showed up and brought it back old school, but Chaos won with some excellent

2946
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:34,560
locking.

2947
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:38,600
Mel B and Rain provided some sweet tunes at the Fanime Rave, and were the only two DJs

2948
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:41,120
who played music that anyone can dance to.

2949
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:45,800
I won't get into how I feel about anime con rave music here, but suffice to say that Mel

2950
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:48,600
B and Rain are following their passion of music.

2951
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:51,960
By the way, if you're really lost right now, these are all people that were very much like

2952
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:56,800
win, place, and show in the DVR tournaments of our day, so if you didn't follow that scene,

2953
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:57,800
you're a little lost right now.

2954
02:25:57,800 --> 02:26:01,760
And I'm pretty sure that Hitori Hanzo was also part of the rave crew as well.

2955
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:02,760
Yes.

2956
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:07,960
But I want to say, for those that were, this is a great email.

2957
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:10,520
Let's lose people further with a resounding, hi guys!

2958
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:11,520
Shut up.

2959
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,240
I'm actually totally...

2960
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:15,160
I wanted to go to Fanime this year, but it didn't work out.

2961
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:18,400
I'm going to Fanime next year, I don't care.

2962
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:22,320
Finally at Kentucky Con in Sacramento last weekend, I ran into Lil B, who showed up for

2963
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:25,200
a dance competition to win a thousand dollar grand prize.

2964
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:28,720
For those who don't know, Lil B started dancing seriously around four or five years ago.

2965
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:32,740
From what I can hear from his sister, he dances all day and all night and wins dance competitions

2966
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:33,740
all over the Bay Area.

2967
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:38,440
There was some fierce competition at Kentucky Con, but Lil B came out on top to claim the

2968
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:39,440
grand prize.

2969
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:43,320
That man is still like five feet tall, but now he has transformed into a compact ball

2970
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:46,760
of pure energy that exists only to dance and win.

2971
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:50,480
Also I went to Sviggle for the first time in about five years, and Corey Virtu was still

2972
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:51,480
there playing 2DX.

2973
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:54,720
It's nice to know that some things never change in life.

2974
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:56,160
Zing.

2975
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:57,520
Except he's married now.

2976
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:58,520
Can you believe that?

2977
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:04,200
Didn't he like come just walk by you randomly one day and go douche or something?

2978
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:07,120
Uh, no, I think that was the other douche.

2979
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,120
I don't know.

2980
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:11,320
Or somebody, you know, somebody else did that and I was like, what?

2981
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:14,000
Let's talk about happier subjects.

2982
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,200
He did the, the, the bag of flour.

2983
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,160
Who did the bag of flour?

2984
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:19,160
That was Changer.

2985
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:20,160
That was Changer.

2986
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,160
That was.

2987
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:22,160
He didn't.

2988
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,120
I thought that Corey did something else.

2989
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:28,460
Anyway, my brain, okay.

2990
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:29,960
It's nice to know some things never change in life.

2991
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:33,380
I hope you all enjoyed my edition of Where Are They Now?

2992
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:37,000
The prevailing theme is that the freestylers are still dancing just without the aid of

2993
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,240
arrows and a dance pad.

2994
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:42,380
Definitely check out the DS players on YouTube and we'll be locking as well.

2995
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:45,920
The way I see it, if a bunch of anime nerds who liked a dancing video game become one

2996
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,760
of the best crews in the Bay Area, anyone can learn to dance.

2997
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:50,240
Happy birthday, OLR, and I love you all.

2998
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:52,480
You're truly AZHP.

2999
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:53,480
Great email.

3000
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:54,480
Yes.

3001
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:55,480
Worth.

3002
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:56,480
For, for like 5% of the audience.

3003
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,480
I need some lighter.

3004
02:27:57,480 --> 02:27:59,760
For everybody in this room.

3005
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,760
Yes.

3006
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,760
Exactly.

3007
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:02,760
Memories.

3008
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:03,760
Okay.

3009
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:04,760
Hi, all.

3010
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:05,760
Hi.

3011
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,760
Hi.

3012
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:07,760
Hi.

3013
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:10,200
First off, I want to thank you guys for giving me so many tips for a horror point and click

3014
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:11,200
game.

3015
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,200
I started with Amnesia, The Dark Descent.

3016
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,280
I've never been so scared in my life.

3017
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:17,080
When my husband, who stood right behind me, said something to me, I shrieked and almost

3018
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:19,680
punched him in his manly hood.

3019
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:22,240
I would say your suggestion was a great success.

3020
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:25,640
Secondly, congrats on producing such a great podcast for nine years.

3021
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:29,160
I only hope that we perhaps can look forward to another nine years.

3022
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:35,880
I have two questions for, I have two questions for all of you.

3023
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:39,840
Since I'm an MMO addict, what do you think of the upcoming MMO, The Secret World?

3024
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:43,040
I'm hoping it will be really good, Horcrux, Lulu, etc.

3025
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:46,640
But I do fear that it might not be as good in the end as I want it to be.

3026
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:48,720
A bit what I got with Conan.

3027
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:51,840
My second question, in these nine years of podcasting, what have you guys learned about

3028
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,960
yourselves in podcasting?

3029
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:55,000
Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?

3030
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Friends of love, Sil.

3031
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
P.S.

3032
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:00,600
I'm still going to Ninja Dark Sakura for an interview on Girls Gone Wow.

3033
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:01,600
I'm down for it.

3034
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,920
Those are two completely different questions.

3035
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:06,760
The Secret World, I don't know much about it, but I'm doing a little bit of reading

3036
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:07,760
on it.

3037
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:10,700
And it sounds like it's the folks that made Age of Conan, so it ties into that.

3038
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:15,060
And Anarchy Online, it's being made for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.

3039
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:21,080
And there's no levels, no classes, it's all skill-based, so you don't have to level grind.

3040
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:26,040
And I guess there's several side quests and all that typical stuff you know on MMO.

3041
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:28,640
I don't know much about this game.

3042
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:31,680
I don't think they showed it in E3 this year, or if they did, it was a little bit under

3043
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:32,680
the radar.

3044
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:34,160
So I don't know enough about it to really comment on it.

3045
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:36,280
I want to total call a Cthulhu MMO.

3046
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:41,640
I hope it's better than the Conan MMO was.

3047
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:44,560
Ju just said what I was seeing, where you're never going to get a character past level

3048
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,560
five.

3049
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:46,560
What was the second question?

3050
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:49,640
The second question was something about podcasting itself, right?

3051
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:52,560
What have you guys learned about yourselves and podcasting, and do you have any tips for

3052
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:53,560
the rookies out there?

3053
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:54,560
Oh, God.

3054
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,240
I've learned that I have a high tolerance for bullshit now.

3055
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:59,240
Not really.

3056
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:00,640
I don't have a high tolerance for bullshit.

3057
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:05,740
That's kind of a wide question, considering how much the whole process of quote-unquote

3058
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:09,200
podcasting has changed over the last nine years as well.

3059
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,200
That's true.

3060
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:11,200
There was no podcasting when OLR started.

3061
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:13,320
Yeah, there was no such thing as a podcast.

3062
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:18,200
There was just broadcasting on live 365, and boom, there you go, shoutcast server galore.

3063
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:23,440
I will tell you one big thing that I've learned just from being a quote public figure, because

3064
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:30,640
we would get emails from complete strangers, that when someone is saying that you need

3065
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:36,280
to go back to the kitchen and that you're bringing down the podcast, it's sort of like,

3066
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:38,200
well, they don't know shit about me.

3067
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:39,200
I don't care.

3068
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:43,640
It was that point where I was like, I don't really care.

3069
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:45,520
I can take whatever comes my way.

3070
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:49,880
I've got a lot of people supporting me, and really, those are the people that I'm doing

3071
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:50,880
this for.

3072
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:51,880
Yeah.

3073
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:52,880
Haters going to hate.

3074
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:53,880
Exactly.

3075
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:54,880
That was the big thing.

3076
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:55,880
Haters going to hate.

3077
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:59,320
And for every troll out there, look at the chat room.

3078
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:03,640
People that are spending their Sunday nights listening to some schmoes on the internet

3079
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:04,640
talk about hate.

3080
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:05,640
They could be in church.

3081
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:10,040
I mean, that's why to be here, but let me give you the number one piece of advice.

3082
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:15,080
I could do a podcast on podcasting, but let me give you the number one piece of advice.

3083
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:16,920
Maybe two pieces of advice.

3084
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:21,480
Number one, don't do a podcast because you want to be famous.

3085
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:24,520
If you're doing it for that reason, you're doing it for the wrong reason.

3086
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:25,520
Trust me.

3087
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:26,520
You're getting into a very bad-

3088
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:27,520
I quit.

3089
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:28,520
Thing.

3090
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:33,400
And the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio, the very first hundred episodes of

3091
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:38,480
Orange Lawns Radio were for 12 people, but they were 12 people that were giving up their

3092
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:41,160
Sunday nights to come listen to what we had to say.

3093
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:45,800
And it was like hanging out with your friends at dinner, at Brookfield's, Denny's, whatever

3094
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:46,800
the place is.

3095
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:49,120
Some of us still podcast to 12 people.

3096
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,120
Exactly.

3097
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:51,120
And if you're not-

3098
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:52,120
But we love it.

3099
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:53,120
And that's the whole purpose.

3100
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:57,680
Because those are 12 bad-ass people that you're having fun with.

3101
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:04,920
So podcast because you like that sense of community, no matter how big your community

3102
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:05,920
is.

3103
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:09,200
I made a lot of friends all over the world.

3104
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:10,200
And they've sent us this.

3105
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:11,200
It's not porn.

3106
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:12,200
I did.

3107
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:13,200
It's in that box.

3108
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:14,200
No, it's not in that box.

3109
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:15,520
Do podcasting to get porn.

3110
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:18,920
There's actually not that box, but that box over there still has some of the stuff.

3111
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:19,920
I know.

3112
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:20,920
I know.

3113
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:21,920
Podcasting porn.

3114
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:26,360
And then honestly, as far as the actual production of a podcast, quote unquote, my big thing,

3115
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:27,360
be enthusiastic.

3116
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:32,760
And you don't have to be like, oh my God, you guys, I'm so excited about games.

3117
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:37,000
No, just sound like you want to be doing a podcast.

3118
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Fabulous.

3119
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
What's that?

3120
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Fabulous.

3121
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
No, for real.

3122
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:45,160
Like, just, just, I can't tell you how many podcasts I've heard where it's like, okay,

3123
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:53,400
so welcome to episode number five of Game Casts and we're going to talk about video

3124
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:54,400
games.

3125
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:56,120
Would you like fries with that?

3126
02:32:56,120 --> 02:33:00,320
You know, it's just like, sound reasonably happy.

3127
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:05,520
And I realize sometimes we're very harsh critics about video games here on the show, especially

3128
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:08,800
that guy sitting over there when it comes to Nintendo, but don't mistake.

3129
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:09,980
Don't talk to Drew like that.

3130
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:10,980
Don't mistake enthusiasm.

3131
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:11,980
Fuck you, buddy.

3132
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:17,720
A lot of that is, when I say enthusiasm, a lot of that is really passion.

3133
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:21,320
Have a passion for what it is you're talking about.

3134
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:22,760
Even if you're talking about nothing.

3135
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:25,080
Or talking out your ass.

3136
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:28,920
We rant and we rave because we actually give a damn.

3137
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:29,920
Talking out of my ass?

3138
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:30,920
What are you talking about?

3139
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:35,520
And don't do what I used to do every few years and do nothing but read Harry Potter books

3140
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:36,520
during the podcast.

3141
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:41,760
SSTA 100 Matt in Chat says, I don't even remember what I did on Sunday nights before OLR.

3142
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,840
That's how long I've been listening to OLR, seven or eight years.

3143
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:44,840
I remember what I did.

3144
02:33:44,840 --> 02:33:45,920
I slept.

3145
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:50,160
I used to go to the goth club with Jessica.

3146
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:54,800
Yeah, that's why I was never around on Sundays.

3147
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:55,800
Funny enough.

3148
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,840
Ironically, that goth club sucks now, so.

3149
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:58,840
I know.

3150
02:33:58,840 --> 02:34:02,920
Well, I was just thinking about that two weeks ago because I heard about it in passing or

3151
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:06,720
something and I was just like, God, I haven't been there in nine years.

3152
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,280
Yeah, it's still going.

3153
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:11,000
But it sucks now.

3154
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,500
It's all teeny boppers.

3155
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:13,500
Baby bats.

3156
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:14,500
Yeah.

3157
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:16,040
Complete batlings.

3158
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:17,680
I'm more goth than you.

3159
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:21,080
Either that or I'll wear less clothing than you.

3160
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:25,140
Did I tell you about me going to bat stay at Disneyland?

3161
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:26,620
It was sad.

3162
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:30,120
It was a bunch of little hot topic.

3163
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:31,120
Baby goths.

3164
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:32,120
Burn down.

3165
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:37,160
I slept for this one chick who was wearing full black Victorian garb with the bustle

3166
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:41,880
and everything, pushing her baby in a lace covered pram.

3167
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:43,280
It was the most adorable thing.

3168
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:46,200
I was like, okay, you're doing actual gothic.

3169
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:47,200
Yeah.

3170
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,680
I'm catching up on some of the chat comments from chat.orangelandsradio.com because I was

3171
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:56,280
busy chatting about that last email and I'm catching up with your chats and I want to

3172
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:58,280
say this and then we can maybe go on to the next email.

3173
02:34:58,280 --> 02:35:01,240
I love this comment from dark Tetsuya in the chat room.

3174
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:04,880
This is about the haters going to hate line that a dark soccer was talking about.

3175
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:05,880
Yeah, really.

3176
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:09,440
You've been doing the radio podcast thing for nine years.

3177
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:12,840
What have they done with themselves in that time?

3178
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:18,440
They just right on dig, you know, and that was the whole thing is like the moment that

3179
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:23,300
I saw the sort of misogynistic comments, I was like, it has nothing to do with any type

3180
02:35:23,300 --> 02:35:27,880
of talent or anything that I said they're going to be little, you know, dickless, you

3181
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:34,000
know, dick, peons wonder.

3182
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Next email.

3183
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Okay.

3184
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I'm actually replying to, to stills.

3185
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I say something.

3186
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Look, I'm sending her my email.

3187
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,160
Oh, still was the guest on Horde house and she was fabulous.

3188
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:45,960
I'll reply to it later, but I'm sending still my re my regular email so that, oh, you girls

3189
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:47,800
going to chat offline about pillow fights?

3190
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:49,640
No, about me being on girls gone.

3191
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:50,640
Wow.

3192
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:51,640
Oh, okay.

3193
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:52,640
That's a fun show.

3194
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:53,640
Yeah.

3195
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:54,640
She wants to go wild on girls gone.

3196
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:55,640
Wow.

3197
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:56,640
Mm hmm.

3198
02:35:56,640 --> 02:36:00,480
I want you to take your top off, get the record for the record.

3199
02:36:00,480 --> 02:36:05,080
My tune has already danced mostly naked in front of the Lich King.

3200
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:06,080
Keep your ass out of gold.

3201
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:07,080
Try her.

3202
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:11,760
There's pictures of my tune dancing naked in front of the Lich King before you go on

3203
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:12,760
girls gone.

3204
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:13,760
Wow.

3205
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:14,760
I need you to do some research.

3206
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:18,320
I want you to roll a character on the moon guard server, take off all your clothes and

3207
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:22,600
run to gold Shire and just, just watch.

3208
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:23,600
Really?

3209
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:29,240
See, now you're giving me ideas, Rob, you realize you got on brandy wine.

3210
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:32,520
You realize that when we get back from pink Berry, that's the first thing I'm fucking

3211
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:37,800
straight from our chat to Bree all the way to the Shire completely naked.

3212
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:38,800
Just saying.

3213
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,800
Damn it guys.

3214
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:40,800
Moon guard used to be good.

3215
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:45,800
We'll take technically they, um, they, uh, we'll shoot, um, I'd have to get to storm

3216
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:46,800
wind too.

3217
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:47,800
Is it from storm wind to gold Shire?

3218
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:48,800
I'll win the gold Shire.

3219
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:49,800
Yeah.

3220
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:53,760
Let's roll a human next scene naked.

3221
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:54,760
Oh God.

3222
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,760
Okay.

3223
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:57,920
Dear OLR, I have nothing intelligent to say.

3224
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:58,920
Okay.

3225
02:36:58,920 --> 02:36:59,920
By email.

3226
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:00,920
Okay.

3227
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:02,200
But as a long time listener, I would like to wish you all a happy birthday and thank

3228
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:03,720
you for your dedication.

3229
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:07,160
Running for almost a decade is an incredible achievement.

3230
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:10,520
Sometimes I wonder how much an effect your show has had on me as I've grown up considering

3231
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:13,240
I've been listening since I was 14 or so.

3232
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:15,760
It's been the positive, positive one though.

3233
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:16,960
I'm glad you think so.

3234
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:21,880
I wonder what your parents think, please continue to do your show until the universe collapses

3235
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:25,480
in on itself or until at least the sun goes large enough to swallow the earth.

3236
02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:26,800
Elliot the Afro guy.

3237
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:31,440
Oh God, I can't, I, I, there's been a few people, there was an iTunes review recently

3238
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:35,000
that said, but by the way, we love five star reviews on iTunes and I gotta say one of the

3239
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:38,800
most recent ones that's there is somebody that was literally saying, I grew up on your

3240
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:44,880
show and like I, I really can't wrap my head around that comment.

3241
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:49,920
Like I know it's a compliment and I'm very thankful about it, but I literally can't Rob

3242
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:55,320
what you grew up on this show.

3243
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:56,680
No think about it.

3244
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:57,680
Okay.

3245
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:03,000
When you first started, when we first went off back in 2000 to the Rocky horror convention,

3246
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,000
you were what?

3247
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
22.

3248
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Yeah.

3249
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:09,760
I still don't think you sir have grown up on this show.

3250
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:10,760
It's true.

3251
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:14,400
I, I can, I can agree that from, for myself because honestly when you're in your twenties

3252
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:17,040
you're still sort of in that teenage drama.

3253
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,120
It's why I can't listen to the old episodes at OLR.

3254
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:21,320
Like everybody always asks like, when are you going to post episode one?

3255
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:22,840
It's not that I'm embarrassed of episode one.

3256
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:24,040
I love episode one.

3257
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:25,120
That's just not you anymore.

3258
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:34,400
If I listen to it, I go that guy then I want to punch him in the face.

3259
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:38,000
I know I feel the same way going back on my left journal.

3260
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:44,440
I mean, you, you, you want clear cut evidence, how much I've grown you like,

3261
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:45,440
Mr. young Republican.

3262
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:46,440
Seriously.

3263
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:49,280
It's just take, well, at least he's more of a young libertarian.

3264
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:50,280
Okay.

3265
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:52,280
I like my 2004 shit.

3266
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:56,000
This guy had hair longer than mine.

3267
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I got lazy.

3268
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,720
It actually looks good on you.

3269
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:04,080
I'm due for another haircut anyway, but anyway, but I think, I think I can say safely that

3270
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:10,160
in ever since all of this started, cause I can, I'll even go back to, to usl.

3271
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:13,680
Cause that's, that's where I got my start was guessing on usl a whole bunch too.

3272
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:14,680
Oh sure.

3273
02:39:14,680 --> 02:39:19,240
I mean, usl kind of, I w I will say for all the shit I've given Travis over the years

3274
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:22,920
and all this, and he says, you know, sometimes I refuse to acknowledge the show, whatever,

3275
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:23,920
which you know, isn't true.

3276
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:29,800
I love or understation live, but let me say this about understation live is ceremoniously

3277
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:31,480
passes the mic back over to me.

3278
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:33,400
No, no, it honest.

3279
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:38,240
It showed me that there is an audience.

3280
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:39,600
There's an audience for tickling guys.

3281
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:41,600
What the hell are you talking about?

3282
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:50,600
You know, it definitely was the enabler because KCSC was one thing that was about trying to

3283
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:54,560
get into these pictures from that, by the way, that's when I thought I would be a radio

3284
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:55,560
DJ.

3285
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:56,560
Like that would be my gig.

3286
02:39:56,560 --> 02:40:02,040
That was going to be my life was, you know, waking up with Rob on 97.7 this right here

3287
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:07,320
is more reasons why you should listen from time to time because we even went so far back

3288
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:13,560
as Travis found the video from when we were on the news, when we were interviewed by Christina

3289
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:20,040
Warner because we were doing this, this thing that was so unique, that was never heard of

3290
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:21,040
in Sacramento.

3291
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:22,400
It was such a unique thing.

3292
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:27,880
And now, you know, everybody in their dog has a podcast, but we were doing it way back

3293
02:40:27,880 --> 02:40:28,880
when.

3294
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:29,880
You know what it makes me think of?

3295
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:32,200
Oh, it's so much fun.

3296
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:36,880
By the way, that was the greatest moment in nine years of orange on radio.

3297
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:37,880
I will say it was that.

3298
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:40,240
Oh, it's so much fun.

3299
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:45,000
One of my favorite movies is a lot of our old school listeners know is pump up the volume

3300
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
and it started it.

3301
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,440
But in the movie, it started with one guy with his shortwave radio.

3302
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:53,460
And at the end of the movie, everyone picked up a shortwave radio and wanted to get their

3303
02:40:53,460 --> 02:40:54,460
voice out there.

3304
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:57,840
And that's kind of what I see things happening with the people who jumped onto podcasting

3305
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:03,600
right away and how it grew from there is that people are really finding that there's people

3306
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:05,720
who listen to what they have to say.

3307
02:41:05,720 --> 02:41:11,360
Still think we have a better audience than any kind of tickling guys ever could get.

3308
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:13,320
I will also say this about conversation live.

3309
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:20,120
The episode where we randomly called the bunny ranch and ended up talking to dude for like

3310
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:27,960
Dennis was trying to get me to go there for free and was possibly easily one of the top,

3311
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:28,960
maybe the top.

3312
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:29,960
Oh, yeah.

3313
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:30,960
Thing that has ever.

3314
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:31,960
Oh, yeah.

3315
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:32,960
On Internet radio for me.

3316
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:38,480
You know, one of my favorites was on USO calling Disneyland when there were phones in the park.

3317
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:44,960
And then the Disney, you know, we we've actually been trying that recently, but it's so hard

3318
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:47,280
to find a live phone line in Disneyland anymore.

3319
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:49,320
Yeah, it's all so all of them.

3320
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,320
The only.

3321
02:41:50,320 --> 02:41:51,320
Don't forget when we called Iraq.

3322
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:52,320
Yes.

3323
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:53,320
Iraq.

3324
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:56,640
We called a hotel in Iraq and we tried to book a hotel room for George Bush.

3325
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:57,720
Yes, I remember Charles.

3326
02:41:57,720 --> 02:41:59,080
We're coming to get you.

3327
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:00,080
That's terrible.

3328
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:01,080
Totally funny.

3329
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:02,080
All right.

3330
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,640
Hey, whose birthday show is this?

3331
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:05,640
Okay.

3332
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:06,640
Last email.

3333
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:07,640
All caps.

3334
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:10,640
Bobby wishes all our happy birthday with a birthday taco.

3335
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:11,640
Tacos.

3336
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:12,640
All caps.

3337
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:13,640
Bobby.

3338
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:15,120
That's how you have to read.

3339
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,120
He's not pregnant.

3340
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:17,120
He just really likes tacos.

3341
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:18,120
That's how you have to read.

3342
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:19,120
All caps.

3343
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:20,960
I'm going to save the Bobby comments for his show.

3344
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:23,200
I always read Bobby's emails last.

3345
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:25,880
He's got a six year anniversary and 300 episodes.

3346
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:26,880
He's having a sex-a-versary.

3347
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:28,480
Thank you, Bobby.

3348
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:31,880
But now I think I'm all lowercase.

3349
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:37,240
All right.

3350
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:38,240
Is that it for emails?

3351
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:39,240
Yarp.

3352
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,240
Thank God.

3353
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:41,240
No.

3354
02:42:41,240 --> 02:42:42,240
No.

3355
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,240
No.

3356
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:44,240
No.

3357
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:45,240
No.

3358
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:46,240
No.

3359
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:47,240
No.

3360
02:42:47,240 --> 02:42:48,240
No.

3361
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:49,240
No.

3362
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:50,980
Bobby was amongst all this talk of the bunny ranch.

3363
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:52,640
All right.

3364
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:57,140
Yes, unfortunately no bunny ranch came to transition into that, but we can talk a little

3365
02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:58,400
bit about Bungee.

3366
02:42:58,400 --> 02:43:02,980
Bungee's doing the kind of anniversary of Halo thing right now.

3367
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:04,780
Or I guess anniversary of Bungee.

3368
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:06,800
20 years of Bungee.

3369
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:12,400
And with that, a guy by the name of Daniel Bleszek.

3370
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:17,540
He's been working on an iPad port of Marathon.

3371
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:24,000
And I guess basically now it's almost ready to go and it's pending Apple's approval right

3372
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,560
now for the low low price of zero dollars.

3373
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:33,580
And if that isn't enough, apparently they're also releasing the final game of the marathon

3374
02:43:33,580 --> 02:43:37,900
trilogy Infinity to the open source community.

3375
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:42,960
So maybe that will also come to the iPad since it'll be open source and someone can port

3376
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:43,960
it over.

3377
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:44,960
Pretty awesome.

3378
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:53,700
Alright, and then, um, let's see, yeah, that's it for now.

3379
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:57,160
Alright, let's move on to a story about Silent Hill Downpour.

3380
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:02,540
Well guess what Silent Hill Downpour, or as some are calling it Silent Hill Alan Wake,

3381
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:06,340
Silent Hill Downpour will not have Pyramid Head.

3382
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:08,380
Aww, you guys, you guys know Pyramid Head, you love it?

3383
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:09,940
And it will not be good either.

3384
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:14,460
Unfortunately some of the people that played it at E3, I'm not hearing a whole lot of it,

3385
02:44:14,460 --> 02:44:17,220
but it will have 100% more corn in it.

3386
02:44:17,220 --> 02:44:21,820
It will have guns and they're saying they're treating the gun like the gun in the road

3387
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:24,940
by Cormac McCarthy.

3388
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:27,480
There is a gun, but there are only three bullets.

3389
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:28,980
So how will you use them?

3390
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:29,980
Hmm.

3391
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:32,060
Well, that was kind of always what Silent Hill was about.

3392
02:44:32,060 --> 02:44:36,020
It was never about confronting things head on, but about, you know, what do you run from

3393
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:37,020
and what do you take on?

3394
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:42,060
And I don't know if that's, that doesn't sound like a totally new concept to me, but whatever.

3395
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:50,820
So yeah, so there won't be Pyramid Head, but there's supposedly will be some other scary

3396
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:51,820
people.

3397
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:52,820
Whoopee.

3398
02:44:52,820 --> 02:44:53,820
Alright.

3399
02:44:53,820 --> 02:44:54,820
Dark Sakura.

3400
02:44:54,820 --> 02:45:02,500
You have to make, you know, a nice wide path for Shermy so she can waddle on through.

3401
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:03,500
Yeah.

3402
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:04,500
Poor baby.

3403
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:05,500
Okay.

3404
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:15,300
Valve likes the Wii U. Confirmed, Valve likes Wii.

3405
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:26,220
Gabe Newell said at New York's Games for Change Festival, that they like the Nintendo Wii

3406
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:32,220
U and he's quoted as saying Wii U seems to be a lot more powerful than the previous generation.

3407
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:37,400
It sort of fits better into the scalability in terms of graphics performance and CPU performance,

3408
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:41,940
so I think it'll be a lot easier for us to fit into our scalability model.

3409
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:44,220
We've always loved Nintendo.

3410
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:50,780
So they're saying that they are still looking into different console counterparts, starting

3411
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:55,300
with the 360 and recently moving to the PS3.

3412
02:45:55,300 --> 02:46:00,420
They're saying that the Wii U is going to be scalable.

3413
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:05,220
Maybe in Portal 3, you can be GLaDOS with that whole little screen thing.

3414
02:46:05,220 --> 02:46:08,180
All you control is the camera angle in the little room.

3415
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:09,180
Now you're the troll.

3416
02:46:09,180 --> 02:46:14,340
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

3417
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:32,620
It's the part of the show where we get Inkstein.

3418
02:46:32,620 --> 02:46:38,020
FU to the remnants of my sinus infection deciding to move into my lungs.

3419
02:46:38,020 --> 02:46:39,420
Evicted!

3420
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:46,460
Um, FU to having a headache.

3421
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:53,220
Um, FU to the fact that I see a lot of things at Pride festivals that make me not have a

3422
02:46:53,220 --> 02:46:54,220
lot of pride.

3423
02:46:54,220 --> 02:47:00,620
And I'm talking about just drunk bitches that just go to get drunk and take their top off.

3424
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:06,020
Like it's just, I can't stand, it's like a frat party, some of that shit that I see going

3425
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:09,740
on in the streets and it's just, it's just dumb.

3426
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:10,740
I don't know.

3427
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:12,820
It doesn't make me happy.

3428
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:15,860
You want to show your pride protest something.

3429
02:47:15,860 --> 02:47:17,340
That's how it all started.

3430
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:21,940
Uh, Jessica Harper, any FUs of the week you want to get out?

3431
02:47:21,940 --> 02:47:29,940
Um, FU to judgmental types.

3432
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:30,940
And Drew Nami.

3433
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:36,220
Uh, FU to completely sucking any sort of a sales job.

3434
02:47:36,220 --> 02:47:37,220
Lost my job.

3435
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:38,220
Oh well.

3436
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:44,540
And FU to scheduling conflicts and not being able to seem to be able to get money for all

3437
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:48,740
these great games and other essential shit I need to get done.

3438
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:51,140
At least a lot of them are going free to play.

3439
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:52,140
That's the silver lining.

3440
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:53,140
Ooh, yay.

3441
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:57,180
Alright, uh, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

3442
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:59,020
Loki, you got one more for us?

3443
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:00,020
Yes.

3444
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:05,740
Uh, you know, as if an ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace weren't annoying enough, they're

3445
02:48:05,740 --> 02:48:07,380
going to now support Kinect.

3446
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:08,380
Awesome.

3447
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:14,940
So you spend $150 for the Kinect camera and you get to do wonderful things with your ads,

3448
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:22,340
including, um, getting them to retweet bullshit onto your Twitter account.

3449
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:26,700
By the way, anybody that retweets bullshit from the Xbox Live Marketplace is going to

3450
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:28,620
get unfollowed.

3451
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:30,820
Thank you very much.

3452
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:35,340
You can say, Xbox, tweet, to let people know that you love coke and not the good kind of

3453
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:38,340
coke.

3454
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:42,900
Or like, for example, you know, there may be a trailer for, you know, a movie or something,

3455
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:48,980
you can go, Xbox, near, and it'll show you, you know, the nearest retailer for whatever

3456
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:57,860
or, uh, you know, Xbox schedule for watching a TV show or some bullshit like that.

3457
02:48:57,860 --> 02:49:03,180
And it just sounds dumb.

3458
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:10,500
Uh, one more story for you guys, and guys, this story made Jessica Harper cry.

3459
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:12,300
It's making me sad.

3460
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:17,180
And go figure, it's going to involve Billy Mitchell in a roundabout way, making Jessica

3461
02:49:17,180 --> 02:49:18,180
Harper cry.

3462
02:49:18,180 --> 02:49:21,780
And, of course, Billy Mitchell was in a movie called The King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters.

3463
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:26,220
All right, it doesn't have to do directly with Billy Mitchell, but the director of King

3464
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:30,780
of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters, uh, who, which was, uh, what's his name?

3465
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:31,780
Seth Gordon.

3466
02:49:31,780 --> 02:49:32,900
He was the director of this movie.

3467
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:36,340
He's apparently making a reboot of the movie War Games.

3468
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:37,340
Boo!

3469
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:43,260
That's right, uh, the 1983 movie starring Matthew Broderick, uh, about hackers.

3470
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:45,180
Oh, isn't this a timely story?

3471
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:46,740
Global thermonuclear war.

3472
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:49,860
Uh, there was even a ColecoVision game in 83.

3473
02:49:49,860 --> 02:49:53,700
Uh, apparently he wants to reboot the movie War Games.

3474
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:57,140
Why does this piss you off, Jessica Harper, as if I need to ask?

3475
02:49:57,140 --> 02:50:02,620
Um, because I'm getting really freaking tired that nobody can come up with a unique idea

3476
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:03,620
anymore.

3477
02:50:03,620 --> 02:50:04,780
So, hey, let's redo this.

3478
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:05,780
Hey, let's redo that.

3479
02:50:05,780 --> 02:50:07,820
Hey, let's re- oh, wait, oh, Logan's Run.

3480
02:50:07,820 --> 02:50:09,660
Yeah, that's been in production for how long now?

3481
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:12,780
Oh, yeah, let's, uh, redo Pretty in Pink and-

3482
02:50:12,780 --> 02:50:13,780
Or the trailer.

3483
02:50:13,780 --> 02:50:14,780
Why?

3484
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:15,780
I saw a trailer the other day for Footloose.

3485
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:16,780
Yeah.

3486
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:18,780
And I was like, what?

3487
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:19,780
Yeah, it-

3488
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:20,780
Why?

3489
02:50:20,780 --> 02:50:25,940
Because I completely understand that, you know, I- I- I know that I'm probably towards

3490
02:50:25,940 --> 02:50:32,100
the end of the Gen X-er group, because, like, I think 77 was about the end.

3491
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:35,300
But at the same time, I know we're all getting older.

3492
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:40,620
I know that we're all in our late 30s and 40s, but please, please, we don't need to

3493
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:46,100
relive the 80s so badly that we have to keep redoing all of these movies that were great

3494
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:47,100
to begin with.

3495
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:48,100
Stop it!

3496
02:50:48,100 --> 02:50:49,100
Stop it now!

3497
02:50:49,100 --> 02:50:51,820
Stop it now!

3498
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:52,820
You know what?

3499
02:50:52,820 --> 02:50:57,500
For a while, if you look at it, though, they were copying a lot of Japanese movies, especially

3500
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:59,180
in the horror genre.

3501
02:50:59,180 --> 02:51:03,020
And then they started rebooting the horror movies, and now they're rebooting, you know-

3502
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:06,300
It's because everybody- it's like they don't have any unique ideas anymore.

3503
02:51:06,300 --> 02:51:09,380
It's too hard for them to come up with something that is different.

3504
02:51:09,380 --> 02:51:11,980
It's like if you want to get something good and different, you're just gonna have to go

3505
02:51:11,980 --> 02:51:12,980
to the indie market.

3506
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:16,660
Speaking of revivals from the 80s that don't make sense, have you heard of the My Little

3507
02:51:16,660 --> 02:51:17,660
Bronies phenomenon?

3508
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:18,660
Yes.

3509
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:28,100
It's apparently- when I was young, My Little Ponies was for girls, and if you liked My

3510
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:32,620
Little Ponies and you were a boy, you were an FAG, but apparently now-

3511
02:51:32,620 --> 02:51:33,620
It's acceptable.

3512
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:39,340
It's acceptable, and it's like bros get together and drink beer and watch My Little Pony.

3513
02:51:39,340 --> 02:51:44,180
Two words, periphery demographic, for the same reason that guys would like Powerpuff

3514
02:51:44,180 --> 02:51:45,180
Girls.

3515
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:46,180
And I'm just like-

3516
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:49,260
It's been awesome, but I didn't buy into the whole brony crap.

3517
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:50,260
Just like Poker Face.

3518
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:53,100
You know what?

3519
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:55,900
When you said that, I started thinking of those little homies figures that you get out

3520
02:51:55,900 --> 02:51:59,260
of the quarter machine mixed with a pony.

3521
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:03,100
It's like, you remember Secret of the Magic Crystal with the pink anus and everything?

3522
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:04,420
I have that game.

3523
02:52:04,420 --> 02:52:08,980
Imagine getting really high and or drunk and playing that game with your bros.

3524
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:11,420
That's what the My Little Bronies phenomenon is all about.

3525
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:15,740
I'm going to love and tolerate the fuck out of you.

3526
02:52:15,740 --> 02:52:21,740
Plus on top of it now, they've actually completely redone the My Little Pony phenomenon.

3527
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:24,220
They've rebooted the entire thing.

3528
02:52:24,220 --> 02:52:25,460
It went away for a little while.

3529
02:52:25,460 --> 02:52:27,280
And Strawberry Shortcake.

3530
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:31,500
But they came out with all new episodes of My Little Ponies as well.

3531
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:36,180
Now it's supposed to be some really amazing, adults can enjoy it too.

3532
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:41,020
If you're going to do that, bring back something like Animaniacs, please.

3533
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:42,020
I know, right?

3534
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:49,100
I bet y'all can't wait for the Smurfs movie that's coming out.

3535
02:52:49,100 --> 02:52:50,100
Further proves my point.

3536
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:54,420
All I have to say, you touch Jem, I will fucking kill you.

3537
02:52:54,420 --> 02:52:55,620
Oh, it's coming.

3538
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:56,620
I'm sure it's coming.

3539
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:57,620
I'll kill him.

3540
02:52:57,620 --> 02:52:58,620
No, no.

3541
02:52:58,620 --> 02:53:00,340
Except for that guy who does jizz.

3542
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:01,340
That's okay.

3543
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:02,340
That shit's funny.

3544
02:53:02,340 --> 02:53:03,340
He already dealt with G.I.

3545
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:04,340
Joe.

3546
02:53:04,340 --> 02:53:06,220
I'm sure He-Man's coming soon too.

3547
02:53:06,220 --> 02:53:08,360
You know what's actually kind of funny?

3548
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:16,020
My wife is terribly excited about the reboot of The Bodyguard with Rihanna.

3549
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:18,000
Because the first movie was so great.

3550
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,460
She loves it.

3551
02:53:19,460 --> 02:53:20,460
It's a terrible movie.

3552
02:53:20,460 --> 02:53:23,420
But she loves the movie and she's going to love The Bodyguard because it's a terrible

3553
02:53:23,420 --> 02:53:24,420
movie.

3554
02:53:24,420 --> 02:53:27,440
Because Whitney Houston cannot act at all.

3555
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:28,440
She is terrible.

3556
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:29,440
Period.

3557
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:30,440
All right, look.

3558
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:34,380
I'm opening up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3559
02:53:34,380 --> 02:53:35,380
Give us a call.

3560
02:53:35,380 --> 02:53:36,740
We're going to try and quickly get through calls tonight.

3561
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:38,900
So don't be surprised if I'm rushing you along in your call tonight.

3562
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:40,500
So I have your question ready.

3563
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:41,500
Or comment.

3564
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:42,500
1-877-GAME-OLR.

3565
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:44,060
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3566
02:53:44,060 --> 02:53:46,260
The Skype line is open right now.

3567
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:47,940
It's going to take about a minute for them to get the message.

3568
02:53:47,940 --> 02:53:49,740
I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

3569
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:54,300
Rob, by the way, said this while we were in the car coming back from Disneyland.

3570
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:55,780
The whole...

3571
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:59,860
No, when Bobby was talking about...

3572
02:53:59,860 --> 02:54:00,860
Not Bobby.

3573
02:54:00,860 --> 02:54:01,860
It was...

3574
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,860
Peter was talking about hanging out with us.

3575
02:54:02,860 --> 02:54:05,240
It was like listening to an episode of OLR.

3576
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:07,180
Then he broke into the phone line spiel.

3577
02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:09,300
I was like, that's it.

3578
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:12,500
Actually, you do say it exactly the same way every week.

3579
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:13,500
1-877-GAME-OLR.

3580
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:16,940
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3581
02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:17,940
Give us a call.

3582
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:18,940
We'll talk.

3583
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:19,940
No big coffee talk.

3584
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:21,940
I'll give you a topic.

3585
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:22,940
Barbara.

3586
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:23,940
Mormon tabernacle choirs.

3587
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:25,940
Neither Mormon nor tabernac...

3588
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:27,700
Discuss.

3589
02:54:27,700 --> 02:54:29,700
Talk amongst yourselves.

3590
02:54:29,700 --> 02:54:30,860
Well...

3591
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:33,940
I'm feeling verklempt.

3592
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:34,940
No calls.

3593
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:35,940
Let's...

3594
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:36,940
It takes a minute.

3595
02:54:36,940 --> 02:54:37,940
We got like that minute buffer thing going on.

3596
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:38,940
What's wrong with you people?

3597
02:54:38,940 --> 02:54:40,220
They haven't heard the number yet.

3598
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:41,220
They don't think the Skypline...

3599
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:45,740
And here I complain about our like five second buffer over on USL.

3600
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:49,620
They think we're bitching about my little bronies or whatever is still going on.

3601
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:51,740
So let's go to the Skypline and see who's there.

3602
02:54:51,740 --> 02:54:52,740
See, now their calls are coming in.

3603
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:53,740
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3604
02:54:53,740 --> 02:54:54,740
Who's this?

3605
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:55,740
What up, guys?

3606
02:54:55,740 --> 02:54:56,740
It's Xenocore from the OKC.

3607
02:54:56,740 --> 02:54:57,740
How y'all doing?

3608
02:54:57,740 --> 02:54:58,740
What is up, Xenocore?

3609
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:00,500
Yo, happy birthday, man.

3610
02:55:00,500 --> 02:55:01,500
Thank you.

3611
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:02,500
Welcome to the high council.

3612
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:06,380
You get to rule the village now with the rest of us.

3613
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:07,380
Awesome.

3614
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:08,380
Can't wait.

3615
02:55:08,380 --> 02:55:13,060
Unfortunately, I only have two cats to rule over.

3616
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:14,060
I'm not sure...

3617
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:15,060
I didn't get to the beginning of the show.

3618
02:55:15,060 --> 02:55:18,060
Did you guys give out the news about Star Wars already?

3619
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:20,020
No, we didn't.

3620
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:23,220
But now that you say it, I'm like, oh yeah, that was some pretty big news.

3621
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:25,860
But Xenocore, since you brought it up, I'll let you share.

3622
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:27,980
Well, they're turning it off.

3623
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:32,100
Galaxies is going away.

3624
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:35,180
Does this surprise you, though, with the new one coming out next year?

3625
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:36,180
Not at all.

3626
02:55:36,180 --> 02:55:38,140
They're hurting is what they're doing.

3627
02:55:38,140 --> 02:55:43,940
It's like sometime after the game, the servers are going offline in December.

3628
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:44,940
What you mean?

3629
02:55:44,940 --> 02:55:48,160
That new player experience didn't revolutionize the game?

3630
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:50,180
Don't get me started, Rob.

3631
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:52,100
My bad.

3632
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:53,100
Don't mess with my...

3633
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:55,300
Did you hear that tone suddenly shift?

3634
02:55:55,300 --> 02:55:56,620
Oh, no, you didn't.

3635
02:55:56,620 --> 02:56:01,100
It's not so much that, but that's going to extend this show about another hour and a

3636
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:02,700
half if you get me on that.

3637
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:07,820
He had such powers, because it's so easy to become a Jedi now.

3638
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:11,420
But yeah, they're going to turn it off at the end of December, and they're just trying

3639
02:56:11,420 --> 02:56:16,060
to hurt all the players, so the Old Republic is all they're really trying to do.

3640
02:56:16,060 --> 02:56:20,540
What can other games learn from Star Wars Galaxies?

3641
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:25,340
Don't redesign the entire system without telling your players at a time.

3642
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:26,340
Pretty good idea.

3643
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:28,620
Yeah, pretty good idea.

3644
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:31,180
What do you most hope for when it comes out of the new Star Wars game?

3645
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:32,380
I imagine you're going to play it.

3646
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:35,380
If you were following the old one, you're probably going to try the new one, right?

3647
02:56:35,380 --> 02:56:40,620
Yeah, I'm reserving myself until I see it in action, though, because although technically

3648
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:45,340
the old game did not have any levels, it was skill-based, you can never avoid grinding

3649
02:56:45,340 --> 02:56:50,800
in an MMO, because you have to spend time using your skills to get better.

3650
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:52,940
So there's going to be a grind somewhere in there.

3651
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:54,540
It's almost impossible not to.

3652
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:55,540
All right.

3653
02:56:55,540 --> 02:56:58,940
Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3654
02:56:58,940 --> 02:57:02,540
Nah, man, just keep up the good work, man.

3655
02:57:02,540 --> 02:57:03,540
All right.

3656
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:07,980
It's a good staple for Sunday to talk people right into Betty by when they're done.

3657
02:57:07,980 --> 02:57:11,420
Well, we'll pour out a 40 for Star Wars this December.

3658
02:57:11,420 --> 02:57:17,620
Oh, and one short thing for the whole Bronies thing.

3659
02:57:17,620 --> 02:57:22,500
That all got started on 4chan, and the series' head is a lurker on 4chan.

3660
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:26,340
They actually added a character that's now canonized in My Little Pony.

3661
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:27,340
What?

3662
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:29,940
Derpy Hooves.

3663
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:33,300
There was an editing mistake in the first episode to where one of the ponies was drawn

3664
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:38,340
cross-eyed, and so 4chan ran off with it and named her Derpy Hooves.

3665
02:57:38,340 --> 02:57:40,660
I have to look this up.

3666
02:57:40,660 --> 02:57:41,740
It's already on Know Your Meme.

3667
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:42,980
There's a reference for it already.

3668
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:44,780
Oh, oh, this just in?

3669
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:45,900
Yes, I've received a news bulletin.

3670
02:57:45,900 --> 02:57:46,900
And Rocky Boom covered it as well.

3671
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:49,860
I'm throwing out my fucking television when I get home.

3672
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:51,500
Yes, that news just in.

3673
02:57:51,500 --> 02:57:53,060
Yeah, and there it is.

3674
02:57:53,060 --> 02:57:59,940
And on top of that, they wrote up 4chan came up with a backstory that she's a mail carrier.

3675
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:05,180
And since the series creator is a lurker on 4chan, she decided to incorporate it.

3676
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:09,780
So later on, she included this scene to where she messes up and drops some stuff on one

3677
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:14,620
of the main characters' heads, and they do a cut up in the air where all the Pegasus

3678
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:15,620
horses are looking at.

3679
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:20,620
And you see Derpy Hooves dropping something on top of the other characters.

3680
02:58:20,620 --> 02:58:21,620
Xenocore?

3681
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:22,620
Xenocore?

3682
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:24,740
You know way too much about this.

3683
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:27,220
I found a picture.

3684
02:58:27,220 --> 02:58:29,900
And it's on three news shows already.

3685
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:33,700
Are you now or have you ever been a brony?

3686
02:58:33,700 --> 02:58:36,860
I found a picture of Derpy Hooves and put it on in the chat.

3687
02:58:36,860 --> 02:58:37,860
Oh, hooray.

3688
02:58:37,860 --> 02:58:39,880
All right, Xenocore, I'm just fucking with you.

3689
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:40,880
Have a good one.

3690
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:41,880
Thanks for the call.

3691
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:42,880
Y'all have a good show.

3692
02:58:42,880 --> 02:58:43,880
Later.

3693
02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:45,140
I am saving this.

3694
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:48,860
How do I feel about 4chan controlling what's on my television?

3695
02:58:48,860 --> 02:58:51,020
I feel a little violated, actually.

3696
02:58:51,020 --> 02:58:53,580
I love the name, though.

3697
02:58:53,580 --> 02:58:54,580
Derp.

3698
02:58:54,580 --> 02:58:55,580
Derp derp.

3699
02:58:55,580 --> 02:59:02,060
877 Game O-L-R. A username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3700
02:59:02,060 --> 02:59:03,060
Give us a call.

3701
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:04,060
We'll talk.

3702
02:59:04,060 --> 02:59:09,940
Oh, do we have last minute stories, Loki?

3703
02:59:09,940 --> 02:59:11,380
Oh, he's shaking his head.

3704
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:12,380
Nope.

3705
02:59:12,380 --> 02:59:13,380
Not even trying.

3706
02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:14,380
I don't care tonight.

3707
02:59:14,380 --> 02:59:17,060
There's no way anyone can follow up Derpy Hooves.

3708
02:59:17,060 --> 02:59:20,420
They'll try.

3709
02:59:20,420 --> 02:59:25,900
So what do you hope happens in the next nine years of OrangeLoungeRadio, DarkSakura?

3710
02:59:25,900 --> 02:59:27,540
We start getting paid.

3711
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:30,180
Good luck with that one.

3712
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:31,620
That would be nice.

3713
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:35,940
Remember when we were gonna, uh, remember when people were saying we should be on G4

3714
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:36,940
TV?

3715
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:40,940
Hey, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3716
02:59:40,940 --> 02:59:41,940
Who's this?

3717
02:59:41,940 --> 02:59:44,700
Hey, it's the one and only DJ Ron Maness from Anime GM Session.

3718
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:45,700
How are you guys doing tonight?

3719
02:59:45,700 --> 02:59:46,900
I am fantastic.

3720
02:59:46,900 --> 02:59:47,900
I'm super.

3721
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:48,900
Thanks for asking.

3722
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:49,900
How are you?

3723
02:59:49,900 --> 02:59:54,660
I am good, and Rob, happy birthday, you fabulous, awesome guy, you.

3724
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:57,020
Thank you very much, nice man.

3725
02:59:57,020 --> 02:59:58,020
Fabulous!

3726
02:59:58,020 --> 02:59:59,020
Fabulous!

3727
02:59:59,020 --> 03:00:01,620
What is up?

3728
03:00:01,620 --> 03:00:04,820
What's on your mind?

3729
03:00:04,820 --> 03:00:09,140
Before I get into that, I just wanted to say tonight's show is just pretty damn awesome.

3730
03:00:09,140 --> 03:00:10,260
Well, thank you.

3731
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:13,420
Because no one's been drinking yet, and it's just been just awesome.

3732
03:00:13,420 --> 03:00:15,100
No one's been drinking yet.

3733
03:00:15,100 --> 03:00:16,100
We're high on life.

3734
03:00:16,100 --> 03:00:17,100
Oh, really?

3735
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:18,620
I'm too old to drink now.

3736
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:20,380
My bladder can't handle it.

3737
03:00:20,380 --> 03:00:21,380
Bullshit.

3738
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:24,500
Y'all are probably high on pixie sticks or something.

3739
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:27,300
God, here comes Dan, all right?

3740
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:28,300
Ah, shit.

3741
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:29,780
So what's on your mind tonight, Rama?

3742
03:00:29,780 --> 03:00:30,900
What are you doing?

3743
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:38,260
I have in front of me a bottle of Captain Morgan and a double shot.

3744
03:00:38,260 --> 03:00:44,860
A toast to OrangeLoungeRadio, its hosts, the fanbase, and a nine-year anniversary.

3745
03:00:44,860 --> 03:00:48,220
Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.

3746
03:00:48,220 --> 03:00:52,220
If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.

3747
03:00:52,220 --> 03:00:53,220
Amen, brother!

3748
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:58,660
Well, I'm gonna feel that in the morning.

3749
03:00:58,660 --> 03:01:01,300
I'll drink to that, bub.

3750
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:02,300
Mm-hmm.

3751
03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:03,300
Awesome.

3752
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:04,300
So.

3753
03:01:04,300 --> 03:01:05,300
Yes.

3754
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:09,860
Anything else you want to share with us tonight after that lovely toast?

3755
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:10,860
Maybe.

3756
03:01:10,860 --> 03:01:11,860
What?

3757
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:13,420
If we should announce it live on air.

3758
03:01:13,420 --> 03:01:15,140
Okay, I'm a little afraid.

3759
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:18,180
What are we gonna announce live on air?

3760
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:21,700
Something that we discussed on Twitter Friday night.

3761
03:01:21,700 --> 03:01:23,820
What's that, Rama?

3762
03:01:23,820 --> 03:01:27,580
Our little engagement.

3763
03:01:27,580 --> 03:01:28,580
That's right.

3764
03:01:28,580 --> 03:01:33,220
Since gay marriage passed in New York, which of course is a wonderful thing, you know,

3765
03:01:33,220 --> 03:01:35,220
it's great, you know, hooray for equality.

3766
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:37,140
How are you and Rama getting married?

3767
03:01:37,140 --> 03:01:41,140
Yeah, the first thing I did, I went to Twitter and I said, where's my marriage proposal,

3768
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:42,140
Rama?

3769
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:43,860
I knew it!

3770
03:01:43,860 --> 03:01:47,740
Well, Rama, I'm not saying yes till I get a ring on it.

3771
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:52,380
It's, well, you'll get the ring faster than Salacious Pop will pop it on there, I guess.

3772
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:53,380
I don't know.

3773
03:01:53,380 --> 03:02:00,100
No, I mean, Salacious Pop knows that he's the one for me, but you know, now and then,

3774
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:02,140
I like a little dark chocolate.

3775
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:10,100
Well, you know what they say, once you go black, you don't go black.

3776
03:02:10,100 --> 03:02:16,380
You missed Dan in the other room, going, oh my god!

3777
03:02:16,380 --> 03:02:19,740
Dan mad bro?

3778
03:02:19,740 --> 03:02:21,740
You mad bro?

3779
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:29,820
Alright, well, Rama, until our honeymoon, I gotta say goodnight for now.

3780
03:02:29,820 --> 03:02:31,580
That's quite alright, man.

3781
03:02:31,580 --> 03:02:34,940
Just so you know, my girlfriend doesn't mind, because she plays on both sides.

3782
03:02:34,940 --> 03:02:35,940
I know, it's hot.

3783
03:02:35,940 --> 03:02:36,940
Alright.

3784
03:02:36,940 --> 03:02:37,940
Hell yeah!

3785
03:02:37,940 --> 03:02:38,940
Later.

3786
03:02:38,940 --> 03:02:39,940
Later.

3787
03:02:39,940 --> 03:02:40,940
Later.

3788
03:02:40,940 --> 03:02:41,940
Later.

3789
03:02:41,940 --> 03:02:42,940
Alright.

3793
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:50,140
Are you sure?

3794
03:02:50,140 --> 03:02:54,220
Maybe I'll get more marriage proposals tonight, who knows, we'll see what'll happen.

3795
03:02:54,220 --> 03:02:58,220
Now you need, you know, SSJ100Matt to call you, you know, another, there you go, another

3796
03:02:58,220 --> 03:02:59,220
New York.

3797
03:02:59,220 --> 03:03:01,460
I know what you're looking at me for, Rob, swear to god.

3798
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:05,020
Salacious Pop's in chat, and he's just commented on the situation.

3799
03:03:05,020 --> 03:03:09,180
He said the following, someone's about to wake up in the Hudson River, to be honest.

3800
03:03:09,180 --> 03:03:15,980
I'm not sure if that was for me or Rama, I guess we'll find out.

3801
03:03:15,980 --> 03:03:20,220
Bones006 says once you go bulk, you will never go back.

3802
03:03:20,220 --> 03:03:22,220
Nice typo there.

3803
03:03:22,220 --> 03:03:23,220
Alright.

3804
03:03:23,220 --> 03:03:29,100
We've got time for one or two more calls.

3805
03:03:29,100 --> 03:03:32,900
Rama said to Salacious Pop, oh baby heart.

3806
03:03:32,900 --> 03:03:33,900
Oh.

3807
03:03:33,900 --> 03:03:36,900
Snap snap, there's a call coming.

3808
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:37,900
Snap snap.

3809
03:03:37,900 --> 03:03:38,900
Snap snap.

3810
03:03:38,900 --> 03:03:40,860
Rama Renaissance Radio, who's this?

3811
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:42,940
Um, Nathan Legend.

3812
03:03:42,940 --> 03:03:43,940
What is up?

3813
03:03:43,940 --> 03:03:50,580
Well, I wanted to talk about Smurfs and 3D.

3814
03:03:50,580 --> 03:03:53,340
First question in response, how high are you?

3815
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,860
La la la la la la.

3816
03:03:54,860 --> 03:03:59,660
Alright, let's talk about this all at once, the Smurfs and 3D, all at once.

3817
03:03:59,660 --> 03:04:05,780
Okay, so I think this is going to be the best movie of 2000 plus.

3818
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:07,340
How high do you have to be to think that?

3819
03:04:07,340 --> 03:04:09,420
No, no, let's hear the man out.

3820
03:04:09,420 --> 03:04:11,060
Every gamer gets a voice.

3821
03:04:11,060 --> 03:04:12,580
Except you.

3822
03:04:12,580 --> 03:04:17,940
Okay, so first of all, I use Smurfs in my daily language.

3823
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:23,060
So in order to complete my vocabulary, I say Smurf, I say, um, what Smurf is it?

3824
03:04:23,060 --> 03:04:24,140
Like what time is it?

3825
03:04:24,140 --> 03:04:28,860
So you know, I believe this movie will help us.

3826
03:04:28,860 --> 03:04:31,660
You know what, you're getting Sonic Screwdriver.

3827
03:04:31,660 --> 03:04:34,860
How does this game rate on a scale of one to five Smurfs?

3828
03:04:34,860 --> 03:04:35,860
Exterminate!

3829
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:41,660
Is this game like a jokey Smurf or is it like Smurfette?

3830
03:04:41,660 --> 03:04:45,740
Is this game a jokey Smurf or is it the one game in the village everybody else is going

3831
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:46,740
to bang?

3832
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:47,740
Smurfette.

3833
03:04:47,740 --> 03:04:50,260
Now Smurfette's got younger competition, remember?

3834
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:53,980
I just want to say jokey Smurf, for legal reasons.

3835
03:04:53,980 --> 03:05:00,100
So you really think that the Smurfs is going to be the greatest cultural phenomenon of

3836
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:01,100
our time.

3837
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:03,820
They're going to refer to this generation as the Smurf generation.

3838
03:05:03,820 --> 03:05:08,500
Yes, it's going to change the economy and everything.

3839
03:05:08,500 --> 03:05:10,020
Until the advent of derpy Smurf.

3840
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:13,060
We'll have to pay him Smurf Berries.

3841
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:17,060
And it's all because Obama's president, according to the BBC, apparently.

3842
03:05:17,060 --> 03:05:21,820
Yes, we can't come up with Smurfs, yes we can.

3843
03:05:21,820 --> 03:05:25,060
Yes we can, Smurfs, 2012.

3844
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:26,780
Papa Smurf for president.

3845
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:29,900
You can be a little old.

3846
03:05:29,900 --> 03:05:32,460
And that means not from America.

3847
03:05:32,460 --> 03:05:35,220
I'm from America, USA, USA.

3848
03:05:35,220 --> 03:05:41,580
Now, you know, the sad thing is I probably would vote for Papa Smurf before you catch

3849
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:45,540
me voting for Michelle Bachman, but I'm not going to get political on this program.

3850
03:05:45,540 --> 03:05:46,940
All right.

3851
03:05:46,940 --> 03:05:47,940
Anyhow.

3852
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:48,940
Congratulations.

3853
03:05:48,940 --> 03:05:49,940
All right.

3854
03:05:49,940 --> 03:05:50,940
Thank you so much.

3855
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:53,980
And keep up the good Smurf.

3856
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:59,500
I have a response to that whole thing.

3857
03:05:59,500 --> 03:06:01,480
You know what?

3858
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:05,980
One thing I will never regret about nine years of Orange Lounge Radio is phone calls like

3859
03:06:05,980 --> 03:06:09,800
that.

3860
03:06:09,800 --> 03:06:15,540
Things that just make you say, what the fuck, guys?

3861
03:06:15,540 --> 03:06:16,540
You know what?

3862
03:06:16,540 --> 03:06:21,340
Hey, the only downfall is that we don't have our Swede around.

3863
03:06:21,340 --> 03:06:26,460
Because he had a call from the Swede.

3864
03:06:26,460 --> 03:06:27,720
Is he not here tonight?

3865
03:06:27,720 --> 03:06:29,340
I don't know that he's here.

3866
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:30,340
Oh, bummer.

3867
03:06:30,340 --> 03:06:33,620
And he already told us he's not going to be in attendance at the 10th.

3868
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:34,620
Why?

3869
03:06:34,620 --> 03:06:36,780
Because he has some festival he has to be at.

3870
03:06:36,780 --> 03:06:37,780
I'm like, Dernit.

3871
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:38,780
Festival?

3872
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:41,460
We have to have a Swedish call.

3873
03:06:41,460 --> 03:06:43,260
Well, then fine.

3874
03:06:43,260 --> 03:06:44,260
I'm going to have to call.

3875
03:06:44,260 --> 03:06:45,260
I'll run outside.

3876
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:46,500
I'll say, hey, be right back, guys.

3877
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:47,500
I got to use the bathroom.

3878
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:48,500
I got to take a big dump.

3879
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:50,180
And then I'll go outside and I'll call my cell phone.

3880
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:52,860
Which is funny because the bathroom's like across the hall from the studio.

3881
03:06:52,860 --> 03:06:54,420
Oh, this is the Swedish chef.

3882
03:06:54,420 --> 03:06:55,420
Herbie derbie derbie der.

3883
03:06:55,420 --> 03:06:57,060
And I'll just be the Swedish chef calling in.

3884
03:06:57,060 --> 03:06:58,500
And it'll be incredibly racist.

3885
03:06:58,500 --> 03:07:01,140
We could call the IKEA customer service line.

3886
03:07:01,140 --> 03:07:02,140
Rob.

3887
03:07:02,140 --> 03:07:04,940
I'll just play ABBA.

3888
03:07:04,940 --> 03:07:07,420
Let's just settle on Mr. Bucket for president.

3889
03:07:07,420 --> 03:07:10,140
Do not bring that to the show.

3890
03:07:10,140 --> 03:07:11,140
Mr. Bucket.

3891
03:07:11,140 --> 03:07:13,980
God, that thing is so funny.

3892
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:20,620
Did you watch the Angry Video Game Nerd when they were being haunted by Mr. Bucket?

3893
03:07:20,620 --> 03:07:21,620
Do I want to know?

3894
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:22,620
No.

3895
03:07:22,620 --> 03:07:23,620
I love the Angry Video Game Nerd.

3896
03:07:23,620 --> 03:07:24,620
This was great.

3897
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:25,960
All right.

3898
03:07:25,960 --> 03:07:27,500
Let's go to one more call here.

3899
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:28,500
Let's see what happens.

3900
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:29,500
Hi.

3901
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:30,500
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3902
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:31,500
Who's this?

3903
03:07:31,500 --> 03:07:32,500
That's Legend of Zaku.

3904
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:33,500
What is up, Zaku?

3905
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:34,500
Nothing much.

3906
03:07:34,500 --> 03:07:37,460
Just getting ready for tomorrow for work.

3907
03:07:37,460 --> 03:07:43,460
And just congratulating you on like what, nine years now that you've been on the air?

3908
03:07:43,460 --> 03:07:44,460
Yeah.

3909
03:07:44,460 --> 03:07:45,460
It's been about nine.

3910
03:07:45,460 --> 03:07:48,260
So Zaku, you've been here for almost nine of those years.

3911
03:07:48,260 --> 03:07:49,380
You've been here for quite a bit of it.

3912
03:07:49,380 --> 03:07:50,380
I know that much.

3913
03:07:50,380 --> 03:07:51,380
Yeah.

3914
03:07:51,380 --> 03:07:52,380
I think I was here for seven of those.

3915
03:07:52,380 --> 03:07:54,100
What do you think?

3916
03:07:54,100 --> 03:07:57,100
There's an important question asked on Twitter a while ago.

3917
03:07:57,100 --> 03:08:04,640
What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years of, what is the most impactful

3918
03:08:04,640 --> 03:08:08,680
thing that's happened in nine years of Orange, not just Orange Lounge Radio, but in nine

3919
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:10,220
years of video gaming?

3920
03:08:10,220 --> 03:08:12,060
Oh, wow.

3921
03:08:12,060 --> 03:08:13,060
Damn.

3922
03:08:13,060 --> 03:08:17,380
That's a, well, I guess I could give you the benefit of both.

3923
03:08:17,380 --> 03:08:23,120
Like for Orange Lounge Radio, you breaking away from Live 365, changing up the format.

3924
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:25,100
It's kind of like graduating.

3925
03:08:25,100 --> 03:08:28,740
You start off with Imani, but now you're just encompassing video games in general.

3926
03:08:28,740 --> 03:08:29,740
Yeah.

3927
03:08:29,740 --> 03:08:30,740
We're out of pull-ups now.

3928
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:31,740
Right.

3929
03:08:31,740 --> 03:08:32,740
Exactly.

3930
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:34,740
I'm a big kid now.

3931
03:08:34,740 --> 03:08:35,740
Wow.

3932
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:36,740
Video gaming.

3933
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:37,900
Oh, wow.

3934
03:08:37,900 --> 03:08:45,380
Just the fact that, you know, we've evolved from just from playing with controllers and,

3935
03:08:45,380 --> 03:08:50,020
and you know, and through traditional channels like, you know, through the arcades, but just

3936
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:53,340
evolving to like not needing the controller at all.

3937
03:08:53,340 --> 03:08:57,340
Meaning you're the controller, you know, you being the controller essentially with the

3938
03:08:57,340 --> 03:08:58,340
Wii.

3939
03:08:58,340 --> 03:09:02,980
Well, I know the Wii is kind of like you do need the controller, but you're using, you're

3940
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:09,140
using your extremities to actually, you know, to register input.

3941
03:09:09,140 --> 03:09:12,220
I got one extremity I still can't use to play a game.

3942
03:09:12,220 --> 03:09:15,460
Oh, I'm sure there's ways, sir.

3943
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:18,460
I am sure of it.

3944
03:09:18,460 --> 03:09:19,460
You're just not thinking at all.

3945
03:09:19,460 --> 03:09:22,580
First thing I'm doing when I get my copy of Child of Eden is I'm going to try playing

3946
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:24,700
with my dong.

3947
03:09:24,700 --> 03:09:31,260
In nine years I've, in nine years I've seen basically, you know, Microsoft take like that

3948
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:36,860
little platform that could and just go far with, I have to admit, they didn't, they did

3949
03:09:36,860 --> 03:09:39,740
10 times as better as the Atari Jaguar.

3950
03:09:39,740 --> 03:09:43,020
Just be thankful listening audience that they don't have a cam right now.

3951
03:09:43,020 --> 03:09:49,140
Sorry, I was doing my Child of Eden with my dong while you were talking, I'm sorry.

3952
03:09:49,140 --> 03:09:50,780
Yeah, I mean, that's-

3953
03:09:50,780 --> 03:09:52,660
Isn't that illegal in some states?

3954
03:09:52,660 --> 03:09:53,660
Probably.

3955
03:09:53,660 --> 03:09:56,300
So Rob, that won't work because you don't have a glove at the end to make it look like

3956
03:09:56,300 --> 03:09:58,740
a hand because it still thinks it's a penis.

3957
03:09:58,740 --> 03:09:59,740
Oh shit.

3958
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:00,740
All right.

3959
03:10:00,740 --> 03:10:06,500
But yeah, it's like that, that whole evolution, like gaming, it's like, it's, it's going beyond

3960
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:11,620
what I, what I grew up with before then was just like, you know, going to a friend's place

3961
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:17,580
to play like Genesis and Super Nintendo games or the PlayStation, but it's like something

3962
03:10:17,580 --> 03:10:24,420
that you could sit down, you could go online through Xbox or PS3 and just like, you know,

3963
03:10:24,420 --> 03:10:26,900
get yelled at by, by 10 year old kids.

3964
03:10:26,900 --> 03:10:30,780
You know, we've come a long way from the old school Atari 2600 controller, which if you

3965
03:10:30,780 --> 03:10:32,940
think about it now was kind of phallic.

3966
03:10:32,940 --> 03:10:35,180
I mean, yeah, it's, it's very archaic.

3967
03:10:35,180 --> 03:10:42,700
It's like so primitive that it was just like, it was just a four way stick and a button.

3968
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:43,700
That's all it was.

3969
03:10:43,700 --> 03:10:46,220
I'm saying a giant phallus basically.

3970
03:10:46,220 --> 03:10:53,500
All the way down to like at least eight or, you know, at least eight to 10 actual controls

3971
03:10:53,500 --> 03:10:55,900
on it, on a controller.

3972
03:10:55,900 --> 03:11:01,180
And with the fact that you could actually like use your, use your body to, you know,

3973
03:11:01,180 --> 03:11:02,180
to control things.

3974
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:07,140
I mean, the next step will probably be PS9 when they, when they insert, when they actually

3975
03:11:07,140 --> 03:11:10,580
feed all that data into your, straight and straight into your head.

3976
03:11:10,580 --> 03:11:11,580
It's the holodeck.

3977
03:11:11,580 --> 03:11:14,860
I'm saying every generation of gaming is one step closer to the holodeck.

3978
03:11:14,860 --> 03:11:15,860
Yeah, we're close.

3979
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:21,460
What we need is a VR headset, and we need headsets in which I can basically play back

3980
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:27,180
memories and other stuff, or just have that pipes, you know, directly into my brain.

3981
03:11:27,180 --> 03:11:28,180
And that's it.

3982
03:11:28,180 --> 03:11:33,260
I just literally sit there, close my eyes and that, and I've basically become, you know,

3983
03:11:33,260 --> 03:11:34,400
that deeper into the game.

3984
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:37,900
You are the machine and then you're a Borg.

3985
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:40,620
I think you got Rob excited about pipes and deeper.

3986
03:11:40,620 --> 03:11:42,420
I'm still thinking about my dong.

3987
03:11:42,420 --> 03:11:47,500
Anyhow, all right, Zach, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but take care

3988
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:48,500
buddy.

3989
03:11:48,500 --> 03:11:49,500
All right.

3990
03:11:49,500 --> 03:11:50,500
Have a good one.

3991
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,500
Bye.

3992
03:11:51,500 --> 03:11:52,500
1-877-GAMO-L-R-U-C-N-A-M-S-S-K-I-F-O-R-I-S-H-O-N-I-T-O.

3993
03:11:52,500 --> 03:11:55,700
I guess we can do one more call.

3994
03:11:55,700 --> 03:11:56,700
Sweet.

3995
03:11:56,700 --> 03:12:01,700
I guess we could do one more call, whoever might call us on our nine year anniversary

3996
03:12:01,700 --> 03:12:02,700
show.

3997
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:03,700
See what happens.

3998
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:10,100
Um, yeah, we're running a little long tonight, but whatever it's a birthday show.

3999
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:11,100
We can do that.

4000
03:12:11,100 --> 03:12:16,380
Why are you complaining about something running a little long?

4001
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:20,700
I-D-K. Are you still reading about that derpy horse?

4002
03:12:20,700 --> 03:12:27,120
I was trying, cause he said it had been, it was like a fan character that was, my intention

4003
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:31,380
on bringing up the My Little Brony thing was not to get you all addicted.

4004
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:33,660
That's actually not what I meant.

4005
03:12:33,660 --> 03:12:35,980
Those are not, those are not baked goods.

4006
03:12:35,980 --> 03:12:43,780
I am just reading the My Little Brony Friendship is Magic Wiki.

4007
03:12:43,780 --> 03:12:45,980
Hey we have an Orange Launch Radio Wiki, did you know that?

4008
03:12:45,980 --> 03:12:46,980
It's been updated.

4009
03:12:46,980 --> 03:12:49,100
And if we can get a wiki, they can get it.

4010
03:12:49,100 --> 03:12:50,660
I look at it weekly.

4011
03:12:50,660 --> 03:12:51,660
Do you?

4012
03:12:51,660 --> 03:12:53,560
Yes, when I have to pick the classic game.

4013
03:12:53,560 --> 03:12:56,460
Let's go to another call, maybe this will be the last one.

4014
03:12:56,460 --> 03:13:14,220
Why am I giving out the number again, if this is the last call?

4015
03:13:14,220 --> 03:13:19,140
Jessica Harper has summoned the Swede, and just like that a wild Swede approaches.

4016
03:13:19,140 --> 03:13:21,420
Quick, throw a pester ball.

4017
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:27,940
Queen, Queen, feel the beat.

4018
03:13:27,940 --> 03:13:30,060
Oh well, what the hell.

4019
03:13:30,060 --> 03:13:35,340
He started saying, no, but he started saying, no, it's like, yeah, Swedish music festivals

4020
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:41,100
are like, Efex Twin is fucking playing in Arvika!

4021
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:43,100
The fuck did he just say?

4022
03:13:43,100 --> 03:13:50,180
Efex Twin, Richard D.J. is playing in Arvika, and I'm gonna see it.

4023
03:13:50,180 --> 03:13:56,140
Oh, the Swedish Music Festival is the same weekend as the 10th anniversary of OLR.

4024
03:13:56,140 --> 03:13:57,140
That's the whole thing.

4025
03:13:57,140 --> 03:13:59,380
Yeah, fuck me, in other words.

4026
03:13:59,380 --> 03:14:05,980
If we can't get the Swede on USL for our anniversary, then of course I'm gonna have to subject you

4027
03:14:05,980 --> 03:14:13,540
to the Swede on your anniversary, so thank you very much, Akki Ripper.

4028
03:14:13,540 --> 03:14:17,140
You heard it here first, 10th anniversary from the Swedish Music Festival.

4029
03:14:17,140 --> 03:14:24,260
Here's the thing, if the Swede can't make it to 10 years of USL, then 20 years of USL

4030
03:14:24,260 --> 03:14:25,260
will be in Sweden.

4031
03:14:25,260 --> 03:14:26,260
Oh, okay, yeah.

4032
03:14:26,260 --> 03:14:27,260
There we go.

4033
03:14:27,260 --> 03:14:28,260
There you go.

4034
03:14:28,260 --> 03:14:33,380
So we'll be the ones up at five something in the morning, because we have to maintain

4035
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:34,380
the time zone.

4036
03:14:34,380 --> 03:14:41,740
No, it will actually be in Sweden so that Travis can start off the show by saying, Sweden,

4037
03:14:41,740 --> 03:14:46,580
I am inside you.

4038
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:56,820
And that excites the owls far too much, obviously.

4039
03:14:56,820 --> 03:15:00,580
To question from our chat room, Tiger Claw wants to know, is the Swedish Music Festival

4040
03:15:00,580 --> 03:15:01,580
a rave?

4041
03:15:01,580 --> 03:15:09,380
No, it's not, but it's like Arvika Festival is kinda in a way, yes.

4042
03:15:09,380 --> 03:15:15,940
Let me ask you this, how many people will you make out with at the festival?

4043
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:19,100
If I know myself, none.

4044
03:15:19,100 --> 03:15:20,740
Then it's not a rave.

4045
03:15:20,740 --> 03:15:26,900
Well, the unfunny part is that, well, I'm like one of those, I don't know, because here's

4046
03:15:26,900 --> 03:15:34,540
the unfunny part is that the thing is that I haven't went to a so-called classical Swedish

4047
03:15:34,540 --> 03:15:41,980
Music Festival in like six or five years.

4048
03:15:41,980 --> 03:15:45,880
So I don't know, I might be out of touch of sorts.

4049
03:15:45,880 --> 03:15:49,580
See I think I can get closer and that's the only reason I stick with Pot-a-Pot-a-Paradise,

4050
03:15:49,580 --> 03:15:51,460
drop E and hump the coin return.

4051
03:15:51,460 --> 03:16:00,900
Okay, well, I have, but no, I'm way uncertain as far as I'm going to make out with anyone.

4052
03:16:00,900 --> 03:16:06,100
And plus, by the way, but bonus point if I can find any CPI.

4053
03:16:06,100 --> 03:16:11,340
Okay, Ripper, I'm going to let you have the last say here tonight on the Skype line and

4054
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:15,540
I want to know the question I've asked a few other callers that we got through Twitter.

4055
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:19,460
What's been the most impactful thing in the past nine years in gaming?

4056
03:16:19,460 --> 03:16:34,020
Do you think that's, uh, I, I have no, I, the only thing that I can take up top of my

4057
03:16:34,020 --> 03:16:38,260
head is like the Wii controller.

4058
03:16:38,260 --> 03:16:40,260
What the hell?

4059
03:16:40,260 --> 03:16:42,780
No, no, I, I'm sorry.

4060
03:16:42,780 --> 03:16:49,500
I apologize to the rest of the listeners at this point, but Travis and I have to know.

4061
03:16:49,500 --> 03:16:52,020
Have you shoved a Wii controller up your butt today?

4062
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:54,860
No, I have not, unfortunately.

4063
03:16:54,860 --> 03:16:58,660
I have shoved other things up my butts as well.

4064
03:16:58,660 --> 03:17:01,880
Thank you, sir.

4065
03:17:01,880 --> 03:17:02,880
And he doesn't disappoint.

4066
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:04,660
And we'll end on that note.

4067
03:17:04,660 --> 03:17:06,380
Thank you, Aki Ripper.

4068
03:17:06,380 --> 03:17:08,020
Have fun at the Swedish Music Festival.

4069
03:17:08,020 --> 03:17:20,820
Later, I can think no of no better way to cap off nine years of orange launch radio

4070
03:17:20,820 --> 03:17:21,820
than that.

4071
03:17:21,820 --> 03:17:23,220
Now we have 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.

4072
03:17:23,220 --> 03:17:25,220
So bye everybody.

4073
03:17:25,220 --> 03:17:31,140
I haven't shoved a Wii controller up my ass today, but I shoved something else up my ass.

4074
03:17:31,140 --> 03:17:34,140
La la la la la la la la.

4075
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:36,340
Hey, Mr. DJ.

4076
03:17:36,340 --> 03:17:38,300
Rob just turned red.

4077
03:17:38,300 --> 03:17:42,180
You're welcome.

4078
03:17:42,180 --> 03:17:43,580
You're so very, very welcome.

4079
03:17:43,580 --> 03:17:47,780
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as if I need to ask tonight.

4080
03:17:47,780 --> 03:17:51,780
Uh, Loki, thank you for being here, as you always are.

4081
03:17:51,780 --> 03:17:52,820
No problem.

4082
03:17:52,820 --> 03:17:55,060
And let's make it to year 10.

4083
03:17:55,060 --> 03:17:56,380
What's your final thought tonight?

4084
03:17:56,380 --> 03:18:00,620
My final thought tonight is Earth Defense Wars, Earth Insect Armageddon next week.

4085
03:18:00,620 --> 03:18:03,060
I cannot wait to play it.

4086
03:18:03,060 --> 03:18:04,060
Screw everything else.

4087
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:08,220
I don't give a crap about your fucking Black Eyed Peas experience.

4088
03:18:08,220 --> 03:18:11,820
It's all about blowing up insects, large insects.

4089
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:14,180
Let me go to the guests tonight and get their final thoughts as well.

4090
03:18:14,180 --> 03:18:17,340
Drew Nami, first off, our ever present intern.

4091
03:18:17,340 --> 03:18:18,940
Good luck with everything going on in your personal life.

4092
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:21,740
I know you got a lot of change coming on the horizon, but we appreciate you stopping by

4093
03:18:21,740 --> 03:18:24,820
to tip your hat at our little program, our dog and pony show.

4094
03:18:24,820 --> 03:18:25,820
I'll be back.

4095
03:18:25,820 --> 03:18:26,820
Uh, all right.

4096
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:28,700
Uh, your final thoughts tonight?

4097
03:18:28,700 --> 03:18:32,940
Wii controller, what the hell?

4098
03:18:32,940 --> 03:18:37,780
Jessica Harper, I don't know what to say to you right now.

4099
03:18:37,780 --> 03:18:40,620
I think I'm going to thank you for being here tonight.

4100
03:18:40,620 --> 03:18:45,620
I might take that back tomorrow once the ratings come in for the show.

4101
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:50,180
In all seriousness, best of luck on your audition, knock them dead.

4102
03:18:50,180 --> 03:18:51,180
And let's karaoke sometime.

4103
03:18:51,180 --> 03:18:52,180
That would be fun.

4104
03:18:52,180 --> 03:18:53,180
Yeah, totally.

4105
03:18:53,180 --> 03:18:54,900
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

4106
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:59,660
I'm just going to do my final thought as a nice big butt plug.

4107
03:18:59,660 --> 03:19:06,740
And please guys, go ahead and go to understationlive.org and download some podcasts.

4108
03:19:06,740 --> 03:19:07,740
Check us out.

4109
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:12,760
If you like us, we're on Saturdays for two hours, 8 PM Pacific, 11 on the East coast.

4110
03:19:12,760 --> 03:19:15,260
And they let Aki Ripper go for like 20 minutes sometimes.

4111
03:19:15,260 --> 03:19:19,980
So Travis has the common decency to hang up on people too.

4112
03:19:19,980 --> 03:19:22,140
All right.

4113
03:19:22,140 --> 03:19:24,980
And let's see, I'll let, I'll let dark soccer go last.

4114
03:19:24,980 --> 03:19:26,400
So I'll give my final thought.

4115
03:19:26,400 --> 03:19:31,720
My final thought is, um, thank you everybody.

4116
03:19:31,720 --> 03:19:32,720
That's my final thought.

4117
03:19:32,720 --> 03:19:33,720
Thank you.

4118
03:19:33,720 --> 03:19:34,720
Dark soccer.

4119
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:35,720
Your final thought.

4120
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:41,380
I live in a giant bucket.

4121
03:19:41,380 --> 03:19:43,640
My spoon is too big.
