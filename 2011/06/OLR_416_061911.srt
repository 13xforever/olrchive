00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Tonight, June 19th, 2011, more details emerge on the Wii U.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
A Facebook game developer sues an alleged copycat, and a Kinect software development

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,560
kit for Windows is released.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,800
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,360
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,080
one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Hi.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
How are you?

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
I'm unwell.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
I'm sorry to hear that.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
What's wrong?

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Sinuses.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Aww.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
I'm unwell.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm unwell.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,200
Everybody say hello to Dark Sakura, also known as Manuel.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,000
And the smartass over there in the corner, the one and only tech master, Loki.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hello.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How are you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm doing fine.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,080
I'm eating the large, unhealthy sandwich, as is tradition.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,120
What is this unhealthy sandwich that you're eating?

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,760
It's a grinder from our very, very discounted food chain, Winco.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,840
But it's basically an Italian sandwich on a loaf of garlic bread.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
It's so good.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
And it's called a grinder?

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,840
It's called a grinder.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
On the iPhone, a grinder, never mind.

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,240
Anyhow, if you want to join us, the ever-present fourth guest on our show is the chat room.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,800
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us in our chat room and say hello, because

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,000
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,880
www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Loki is holding his sandwich

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,240
up in the air like it's a victory pose, like he's He-Man or something, or the little Zelda

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
noise.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Anyhow.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
All right.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,480
So, Loki, you didn't get to join us for the second E3 show, obviously.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,560
That was the last thing that was on the feed, and we were off on Sunday, because we had

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,320
done the other E3 shows Tuesday and Wednesday.

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,800
You were here Wednesday when we talked about things like Skyrim, and I believe that was

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,680
the day that Miklotov had waited in line to play the Vita, and so forth.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,640
Any kind of closing thoughts from you for E3, since you didn't get your chance before

44
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Loki?

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Um.

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Not for John Spodley.

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,240
The play-throw's awesome, I mean.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:37,080
No, I don't know, like, the PlayStation Vita, I don't really care for.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,280
I mean, there's a lot of features to it, which is kind of cool, but I just don't know if

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
I really care about it too much.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,400
I mean, there's not any games that jump out and say, oh my god, I gotta own that.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,880
Like, you know what, Uncharted, see, I'm not a fan of the Uncharted series.

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,440
Not that it's a bad series, but I just never played them, and don't really want to play

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
them.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
There's not enough time to play everything.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Exactly.

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
This isn't our day job, so.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
It's all right.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,600
I mean, it looks good.

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,320
I was unaware, now I don't remember the whole entire feature list, but I guess those things

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,240
have GPS built into them.

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah, I seem to remember that from the original unveiling, yeah.

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,720
I just saw that because I'm setting up the items for it, and they've got, like, some

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
games.

65
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,400
It breaks it down, you know how in the back of those PlayStation boxes, like, okay, you

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,840
need such and such space for storage, it's one player, it's online, it's blah blah blah.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,120
Well, they actually break it down to what features of the Vita are actually used.

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,060
Like, this uses the front touch, this uses the back touch, the tilt controls, the multi-touch

69
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,800
on things, sliding your finger back, I mean.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,160
So on a one to ten on the gimmick meter, this game rates a six or a seven.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah, I'm sure.

72
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,840
Especially those launch games will make heavy use of gimmicks.

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of gimmicky stuff on there, but I think it's got potential

74
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,500
as far as, you know, it's nice that that stuff is on there, just please, publishers, don't

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,400
try to, you know, just make a bunch of gimmicks.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
Use it if it makes sense.

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Exactly.

78
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,760
I mean, don't necessarily have to use the touch screen for stuff you don't, you know,

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
need to use it for.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,120
I mean, buttons work just as well, I don't know.

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,320
Let me go to this comment from chatroom at chat.orangelaungeready.com where, by the way,

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,480
there's a lot of praise going on for your sandwich that sounds really good.

83
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
It is really good.

84
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,960
You get a picture of that.

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
That just looks like...

86
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
That's a half.

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
That's half of the sandwich.

88
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,400
That is a heart attack that you're eating.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
That's half a sandwich.

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Alright, anyhow.

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,160
So, going to chatroom, BlackWolf starts us off tonight, and this is a quote I've heard

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,180
him say several times, in fact on his own show, and I don't remember if he said it

93
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,760
on our E3 or whatever, but BlackWolf starts us off tonight saying, Saints Row is the video

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,280
game version of what goes on in Loki's head.

95
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Exactly.

96
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,320
Pretty much.

97
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,840
Saints Row is basically, cause, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV really was kind of a step

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,680
away from the direction of Grand Theft Auto was kind of going.

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,080
San Andreas was just a really crazy game.

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,680
I mean, you could do so much in there.

101
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
You could do pretty much anything.

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
I mean, you had girlfriends you could do, you could go ride a bicycle, you can do base

103
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,160
jumping, you know, swim in the ocean, fly jets, you know, just wander around the desert,

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,080
go gamble, whatever.

105
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,960
And then, Rockstar's like, hey, you know what, we're going to make the game more realistic.

106
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,640
So we're taking out all the fun stuff, like the tanks, the flamethrowers, the miniguns.

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
We're taking that all out.

108
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,840
We're just going to make this game more realistic, and everyone was kind of like, eh, okay.

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,080
And then, like, as stuff, their expansions came out, you know, they started kind of bringing

110
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,480
that over the top stuff back, but it's still nothing to what San Andreas was, whereas Saints

111
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,840
Row was kind of crazy at the beginning, and then the second game was even crazier.

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,640
The third game is just, they basically, the developer was even, you know, quoted saying

113
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,400
before, you know, Saints Row, the, you know, activities and stuff were kind of over the

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
top.

115
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Saints Row the third were making everything over the top.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,320
Every single situation that you're in, every single battle that you're, you know, fighting,

117
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,600
you know, the story, everything is going to be ridiculous, just over the top.

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,440
You're going to be telling yourself, I can't believe I'm doing this right now.

119
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,760
And just even watching the gameplay videos, and I've linked a ton of them on Twitter,

120
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,000
it's just, it's awesome.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,640
The only disappointment for me is the lack of multiplayer.

122
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,560
I mean, there's two player co-op in the single player campaign, but I really wish there was

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
like a death match or something.

124
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,760
Are you worried at all about this?

125
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Because this notoriously happens at E3.

126
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,560
You know, we've been doing a show for nine years now, and I think out of those nine years

127
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
we've gone to like five or six E3s.

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,120
So out of those E3s, we tend to come out of there really liking one game, and then sometimes

129
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,280
that game will come out and it sucks.

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,840
My case in point, Nintendogs, I was so excited for Nintendogs, when it came out and it was

131
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
over in 15 minutes.

132
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,320
Are you worried that's what's going to happen?

133
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,400
No, I am absolutely confident that it's going to be an awesome game, because the other games

134
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,960
have been great.

135
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
And that's the thing.

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,200
It's like, you know, Saints Row, when it first came out, I'm like, well, there's no Grand

137
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,880
Theft Auto in the 360, so this will just have to kind of do, and you know what?

138
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,680
It wasn't a Grand Theft Auto clone.

139
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
I mean, it kind of started off as that, I guess, a little bit.

140
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,520
I mean, there was a lot of stuff it imitated, but it was its own thing.

141
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,360
And as the future games came out, it really came onto its own, and it's a really fun game.

142
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,400
Even if you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto, you really should go play Saints Row, because

143
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,680
it's a really fun game.

144
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Let me ask this.

145
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,640
Of course, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that good stuff, but I'm just dying

146
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,440
to ask this question to Loki, since we're on the topic of Saints Row the Third.

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,040
Obviously, one of the big games that came out this week was Duke Nukem Forever.

148
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,120
And although I think it's on our showroll to cover later in the show, it's no big surprise.

149
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,200
I think a lot of you know, Duke Nukem Forever has been really razzed in the gaming press

150
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,640
as a whole.

151
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,600
And a lot of it has been about, you know, just how, it's almost like the sense of humor

152
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,400
in the game is to that point where it's like the guy that's so drunk, he's getting really

153
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,120
awkward with his humor.

154
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,960
And a lot of people are really saying like, the humor kind of steps over a line in this

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
game.

156
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,160
But yet, some of those same people are really excited the way you are about Saints Row the

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Third.

158
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,080
Do you think there's a discrepancy, a bit of hypocrisy going on right now in the mainstream

159
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
gaming press?

160
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,640
There's not hypocrisy, it's just the way they're describing the game is a little inaccurate.

161
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,400
Here's the problem with Duke Nukem Forever.

162
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,720
My main two problems with it right now, and I'm not that far into the game, are one, the

163
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
game looks very muddy.

164
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,280
Like, the graphics are very brown.

165
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,120
Yeah, I know a lot of shooters out there tend to kind of go with the brown color palette,

166
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,640
but this looks like they had a decent looking game and then they just splat poo all over

167
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
it.

168
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,840
I mean, it's just very dark, and like, even when you're playing it in HD and stuff, it

169
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,880
looks like you're playing it on like a really low res, you know, screen or something.

170
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,840
It's just the colors just look very, eh.

171
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,400
Did Duke literally splash poo on them?

172
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,120
Because I saw in the demo you can do that now, and like, Alan was playing it and making

173
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,360
me watch and I was like, really?

174
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Really?

175
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
You can fling poo?

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
But see, that's the problem though.

177
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,040
Duke Nukem 3D was a very colorful game.

178
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,280
I mean, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just over the top like bright and cheery and stuff,

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,920
but I mean, come on, there's a little bit of a middle ground there.

180
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,800
It's like they intentionally made it look like garbage, and I understand that they're

181
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,240
trying to poke fun at shooters being all brown, but you know what?

182
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
That's just not funny.

183
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,720
It's not funny, oh, haha, all those shooters are crap, so we're gonna make our game crap

184
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
too.

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Why would you do that?

187
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,820
And the load time is terrible.

188
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,540
The load time for the game is just ridiculously awful, and that just screams to me that they

189
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,880
just really rushed their way through this game, and I kind of think that they did it.

190
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,080
It's like they went through the motions of everything.

191
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:54,060
For example, like the first two levels or so that I played through it so far, you can

192
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,260
interact with everything, which is great.

193
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
You know what?

194
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,480
In Duke Nukem 3D, you can open doors, you can hit buttons, you can flip the light switch

195
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,920
on and off and stuff like that, but this is like, okay, I can turn all the showers on

196
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,000
and off, I can flush all the toilets, I can piss in all the toilets, I can pick poop out

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,240
of there and throw, I can draw on a chalkboard and stuff, but that doesn't make the game

198
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
good.

199
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,840
It's just like, you know, I'm walking through, oh, we gotta escape the building, the aliens

200
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,720
are attacking, and it's like, oh, or I can play pool, and I can play pinball, and I can

201
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,800
do this.

202
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
It's kind of pointless.

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,760
They spent all their time making all this stuff work when they really...

204
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,040
It sounds like the version of what we really want to do in Sony PlayStation Home.

205
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
It's like they took...

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
We would like to fling poo in Central Plaza.

207
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,480
It's like they took a really run-down car that's just completely broken, and they put

208
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,580
shiny rims on it, and they want to make sure those rims were extra polished, so they spent

209
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,720
all their time polishing those rims to make them the shiniest rims you've ever seen, but

210
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,000
the car is shit.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,760
It won't drive, because it's just a shitty car, and they rush through there, oh crap,

212
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
I gotta make the car work as well.

213
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,560
That's really the problem, and like some of the spoilers I've heard, and you know, because

214
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,640
the first level of the game, of course, is him playing the video game, and he makes the

215
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
joke, oh, well, is it any good?

216
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,240
Well, for 13 years, it better be.

217
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,200
Well yeah, that's great that you poked fun at the fact that it took 13 years, but then

218
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,120
you spent, what, like a year and a half on this game, and it's terrible.

219
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,760
Okay, I gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangemantrady.com, because we are the show where every gamer

220
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
has a voice.

221
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Here's some voices right now.

222
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,920
Brakeman, a game that has been delayed for 12 years was rushed?

223
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
What the fuck?

224
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
How did they pull that off?

225
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,520
You see, I think it's, and I think this is obvious, I'm probably staying the obvious

226
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,840
here, but I think it's a gross misinterpretation to say this game was in development for 12

227
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
years.

228
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
It wasn't.

229
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
The idea has been kicked around for 12 years.

230
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,280
It has really been in development for like a year and a half.

231
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
But that's terrible, though.

232
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,520
Maybe some art, some things on paper, but come on.

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,240
But, come on, I've seen games at this company, they put out Borderlands, I mean, Borderlands

234
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
was awesome.

235
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,040
Take that damn engine and put it into Duke Nukem, that's all you need to do.

236
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,240
Just redo the assets, and it's perfect.

237
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,700
Salacious Pop is asking, Loki, the 360 or the PS3 console version?

238
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,960
Because the PS3 version is allegedly a leaps and bounds better port, and the 360 one is

239
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
toilet.

240
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
It is the 360.

241
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Hmm.

242
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Okay.

243
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,520
But I don't think that the graphics are that different.

244
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,480
It's the color palette and load time.

245
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,520
Scott Pilgrim in our chat says, Gearbox said that they were going to make the game and

246
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,640
nothing about it being a spectacular game.

247
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,560
Okay, then why even bother?

248
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,000
Why even bother if you're gonna, oh, well, we're just gonna finish it, I mean, we're

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
gonna do a shitty job.

250
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,760
Why would you put your name on it, then, if that's what you're gonna do?

251
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,540
If you're gonna just sit there and poop out a game that, you know, was half done and you're

252
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,280
just gonna kind of patch it all together to make sure it works, why would you even bother

253
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
doing that?

254
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Oh, well, we did it for the fans.

255
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,060
Yes, the fans really want a shitty game.

256
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,520
That's what they've been waiting 13 years for, is a really shitty game.

257
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,040
Let me go to this last comment from our chat room, and then we'll go to our gaming weeks.

258
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,560
Kaijuto in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, I wanna know who thought this game was

259
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,620
gonna be good.

260
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,680
They delayed it 12 years for a reason.

261
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,020
The game would have not seen the light of day if gamers weren't crying about it for

262
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
all these years.

263
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
No, exactly.

264
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,160
I didn't think it was gonna be good, but it's, those are my two complaints, muddy, long load

265
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
time.

266
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Disclaimer, I haven't played the game yet, so I don't have an opinion on it one way or

267
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
the other.

268
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,560
I mean, I can read the reviews, but I also know not to always trust reviews, because

269
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
they're sometimes wrong.

270
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,600
In fact, about a game that I'm gonna get into later during my gaming week, I think a lot

271
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,460
of review sites got it wrong.

272
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,680
But anyhow, as far as Duke Nukem Forever goes, you know, I think a big part of the reason

273
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,920
it came out was because of its legend status that it had in the gaming community as this

274
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,760
is the game you will never get to play.

275
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,200
And obviously, there's a love of the original Duke Nukem 3D and maybe all the way back to

276
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,480
the old Apogee 2D Duke Nukem with that whole crude sense of humor.

277
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,280
I mean, obviously, it's inspired even if it maybe crosses the line, depending on who you

278
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
are.

279
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,680
Anyhow, let's talk about some other games.

280
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,800
As we get into how is your gaming week, what are the games that you've been playing this

281
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
week?

282
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Dark Sakura.

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, to go back to two weeks worth of gaming, I played Kix at Flynn's, and Space Paranoids,

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and Tron.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,920
Now, Space Paranoids is funny because Space Paranoids, which is an arcade game that I

286
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,240
believe you can only play at Electronica, I think that's where the only thing is, it's

287
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,280
sitting amongst all these 80s arcades games, and it's made to look like an 80s arcade game,

288
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
but it's not.

289
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,840
It was something that was made kind of newer, like it's running on a PC, clearly, but it's

290
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
in a cabinet.

291
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Yeah.

292
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
It's kind of interesting.

293
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Yeah.

294
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
That's what it was for.

295
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,800
But it makes sense that they'd put it in with Electronica, because, I mean, it was the

296
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,320
big game when the first Tron came out, you know, in the movie.

297
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,560
Well, and Disney's very about getting you in the experience.

298
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,960
You know, like, when you go on Space Mountain, you are boarding a spaceship and about to

299
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
go through the galaxy.

300
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Space Mountain is not a rollercoaster.

301
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,720
If a Disney employee ever called it a rollercoaster, they'd be sacked.

302
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
It's a spaceship.

303
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
That's how it works.

304
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,640
So when you go to Flynn's arcade, I mean, it's very much a detail thing, and because

305
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,360
Space Paranoids was a game that Kevin Flynn, that's what he made all his money developing,

306
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
right?

307
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,080
Like, they had to make it to beat you in that experience.

308
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,720
Well, to me, technically, Dillinger stole it from him, made all the money, and then,

309
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
yeah, just watched it.

310
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Blah, blah, blah.

311
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
All right.

312
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Fine.

313
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
This is my favorite Disney movie.

314
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,240
Um, we, uh, crap, what else did I play?

315
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,080
Oh, Black Wolf says you can actually play it online as well.

316
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,720
Space Paranoids Online dot com.

317
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Thank you.

318
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,600
Um, I played some WoW.

319
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I played VVVVVVV.

320
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Mm-hmm.

321
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,940
Game's frustrating as hell.

322
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,200
I hear it's a really well-received indie title, though.

323
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I haven't played it myself.

324
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
It's fun.

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah?

326
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
It's fun.

327
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
What do you do in that game?

328
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,320
You don't necessarily have a jump as much as you have a reverse gravity, and so to get

329
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,160
over traps, you have to play with gravity, either walking on the bottom or you're walking

330
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
on the ceiling.

331
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
That sounds kind of neat.

332
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,760
It is, but it's frustrating and a little difficult, but it took a little bit to get used to.

333
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,720
And um, I played some Peggle, and played some, uh, Portal.

334
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Good times.

335
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,440
Portal 2, of course, right?

336
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah, Portal 2.

337
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:08,080
And then, um, we got, uh, Initial D Extreme Stage for PS3, and Dan actually has been playing

338
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,320
a bunch of that, but I had to go in and translate a little bit for him, because I can read enough

339
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,080
in that to get an idea of what menu is what, but it's very Japanese-intensive.

340
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
It's pretty good, though.

341
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,800
It only has, like, two songs in it and one story mode, so, but it's got, like, I think

342
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,600
two extra tracks than what the arcade version has.

343
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,400
I think the arcade version is the fourth stage game.

344
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,920
All I can say is hooray for Reach and Free PlayStation, right?

345
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
So you can do that stuff.

346
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Yeah.

347
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Alright.

348
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,560
Um, but it gave him an excuse to bring back out the, uh, the rig that he bought for Gran

349
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Turismo.

350
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,760
And, uh, it actually works really good for, uh, the PS2 Initial D game.

351
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,560
Just thought I would point that out.

352
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Alright.

353
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,840
Um, and then, uh, I guess that's really about it.

354
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,200
I know I played some other stuff, but my brain's not working, so I'm just gonna say stuff.

355
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,080
Alright, let's go- Oh!

356
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
World Cup Soccer Pinball.

357
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Hell yeah.

358
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Of course.

359
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Of course.

360
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,720
Alright, let's go to, uh, Loki, and, uh, how was your gaming week?

361
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Obviously you played some Duke Nukem.

362
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
A little bit.

363
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Uh, yeah, a little bit of Duke Nukem.

364
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:31,040
Um, pretty much just, you know, a little bit of Duke Nukem, um, a little bit of, well,

365
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,960
lots of Grand Theft Auto, and, um, that's pretty much it, you know, I really didn't

366
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
play a whole lot.

367
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Alright.

368
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
Not every week can be so exciting.

369
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Um, I actually kind of had one of those weeks where I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.

370
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,920
The only new game I played is not new.

371
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,640
I played, uh, Little Big Planet on the PSP, because obviously this is one of the free

372
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,240
games that they're giving away as part of the whole Welcome Back program, so, you know,

373
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,000
that was one of the ones I chose to get, because I loved the original on PlayStation 3, so

374
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,320
I decided to get this one.

375
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm not far enough into it yet where I can really review it, um, but, you know, one of

376
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,600
the big differences I noticed right away is that, well, obviously the graphics are scaled

377
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,340
down a little bit because it's on the PSP and not the PS3, but it's- they capture it

378
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
very faithfully.

379
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,800
Uh, there's only two planes, um, of three dimensions, not three, like you have in the

380
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
PlayStation 3 version.

381
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,440
There's just a front and a back in this one.

382
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,800
But otherwise, all the levels so far seem to be pretty faithfully recreated.

383
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,400
I haven't really got into the whole online stuff and the levels on there.

384
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,500
In fact, I can't even access that yet- now- yet, um, I was starting to wonder for a minute

385
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,680
if they're even there, but there's a planet for download levels, so I'll have to look

386
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,520
into that a little more later on and how all that works.

387
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,400
So, I can't really review the game, but I did play it for, eh, about an hour or so.

388
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,160
But the game I've been spending most of my time with, I actually revisited a game that

389
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,720
I started playing about 15 months ago, but I never finished.

390
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,640
And I think part of it was just, at that time, I was really heavy into WoW and I wasn't really

391
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
playing any other games.

392
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,520
Uh, and then I loaned my copy of it to Dark Sakura for like a year.

393
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,340
So I just got it back when we got back from the Disneyland trip this past Sunday.

394
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,680
And that's Final Fantasy XIII.

395
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,400
And I have- I started over on Final Fantasy XIII because I'm one of those people that

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
with an RPG, if I can't remember the story and where I was at, then screw it, I'm starting

397
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
over.

398
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,520
And so I started the entire game over and I have spent more time in the past week playing

399
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,200
it than I did in its original run when I first played it.

400
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,960
Uh, I'm already past the point where I was before.

401
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,880
So yeah, I've been having a lot of fun with that game.

402
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,400
And you know, that game got razzed by critics a lot when it first came out.

403
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
It was kind of mixed.

404
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
It just had a lot of mix.

405
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,200
And a lot of the people didn't like it because it's very linear.

406
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,880
And unfortunately, Final Fantasy XIII doesn't not get linear until like Chapter 10 or 11

407
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,280
in the story.

408
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,440
And I think that's one of the things that, you know, really bugged a lot of people is

409
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,640
that a lot of the level design is very one path.

410
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,300
Um, but one of the strengths of Final Fantasy XIII for me, of course, is the battle system.

411
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,680
I love the battle system in XIII.

412
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
It's one of my favorites.

413
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Like the whole paradigm shifts into the different classes.

414
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,360
If you've never played, the battle system in XIII is like, you know, you can be a black

415
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,360
mage one minute and then you do like a paradigm shift and suddenly you're more of a buffing

416
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,760
or debuff mage.

417
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,960
Like I guess that would be like a, what are those, the green mages, I think, that did

418
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,480
a lot of that in V. And then, you know, you can switch again and you're more of like a

419
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
warrior.

420
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,000
It's pretty cool just flipping back and forth in the different battles.

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I really like that.

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,760
And then a lot of people bitching about the characters in the game as well.

423
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,280
And I think, again, you know, if you stick with it, a lot of the characters don't end

424
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,620
up so one dimensional if you play the game for more than 10 hours of gameplay.

425
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,800
You know, some of the characters, like the kids are the ones that usually get a lot of

426
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,820
hate, uh, Hope and Vanille.

427
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,440
And those two characters get much more rounded out as you continue on with the game.

428
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,760
So, you know, I think it's worth it if you stick with it.

429
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,360
But at the same time, I also understand why if a game doesn't grab you right away, you're

430
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
not so inclined to want to stick with it.

431
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,680
I think visually, graphically, and sound-wise, there's enough to keep me entertained.

432
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,480
I think the graphics in this game are so freaking gorgeous, like, I can't even explain.

433
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Like if you just, you just like to watch pretty things, there's plenty here to keep you entertained

434
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
for a while.

435
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,800
Uh, but I think part of the big motivator why I want to go back and play this game was

436
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,000
just hearing about Final Fantasy XIII-2 from E3 and it sounds like in this game they have

437
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,420
really addressed a lot of the things that people didn't like about the first game.

438
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,160
Like one of the things I noticed right off the bat were maps, even in the little trailer,

439
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,640
that were not linear.

440
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,760
Maps that showed big environments and open worlds.

441
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,840
So I have a feeling, uh, XIII-2 is really going to correct what a lot of people didn't

442
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,240
like about XIII.

443
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,720
But I want to be able to understand the story, so I wanted to actually just play through

444
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
XIII.

445
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,820
I mean, I could have just read spoilers, but I didn't really want to.

446
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,000
I wanted to play it.

447
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
So that's where I'm at.

448
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Haven't beat it yet.

449
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,160
Hopefully by this time next week, we'll see.

450
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,320
I don't even know if I'm halfway through yet though.

451
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm about chapter 9 or so.

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,240
So anyhow, that's it for my gaming week, at least all is notable.

453
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,160
Of course I play more WoW and things like that too.

454
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,680
But that's all I'll mention on tonight's show.

455
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,160
So let's move on to some housekeeping, then we'll get into the news tonight.

456
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
One big thing of course I wanted to say in the housekeeping tonight was happy Father's

457
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,120
Day to all the gamer dads out there, which would include Loki, it's your first, no it's,

458
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,200
yeah it's your first Father's Day, right?

459
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,720
So congratulations to you on that.

460
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,680
So what all chores did you get to do today?

461
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,040
What chores did you make your son do today?

462
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
How many diapers?

463
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,040
I just had to watch the baby all day and take my wife out to lunch.

464
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,120
No, so I said take my wife out to lunch.

465
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Nice.

466
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,960
Looking at chat.orangelaunchy.com, some comments on Final Fantasy XIII.

467
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,640
Scott Pilgrim says, but Sky, the game gives you a brief recap though.

468
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,440
It does, and the data log is very impressive, but I don't know, I still just, I wanted to

469
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,540
start from scratch.

470
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
So I did.

471
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,040
I figured it wouldn't take me that long to catch up, and it didn't.

472
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,920
Anyhow, on the Father's Day topic too, of course, happy Father's Day to all the gamer

473
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,180
dads out there, or father figures, you know, if you have someone out there that considers

474
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,720
you their dad, then happy Father's Day to you.

475
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,000
Meanwhile, friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchyradio, we're on Twitter

476
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,080
as well, twitter.com slash olr, and visit our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

477
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,600
It'd be nice if we had more posts in the forums there.

478
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,000
Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news, and we'll start off with Loki.

479
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,280
Ah yes, news, and of course we're gonna start off talking about Wii U and some of the clarifications

480
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
on things.

481
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,460
Of course, everyone wants to know what's exactly in the console itself, because all the talk

482
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,440
was about the controller and what the controller can do, but you know, other than some videos

483
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,680
showing what possibly the system can do, we really didn't go into detail about the console

484
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
yet.

485
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,960
And it makes sense, because it's so far off that, you know, this stuff can change.

486
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,680
But right now, apparently the Wii U console will be using a custom Radeon GPU with a chip

487
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:18,920
similar to the R770, basically a chip that's found in some of the last generation ATI cards.

488
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:27,520
For example, like the 770 is in the 4870, which is, you know, it's a decent card.

489
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,520
It's better than some of the stuff that they have right now in the current gen consoles.

490
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,400
So it's good, but who knows, you know, by the time that these next gen consoles come

491
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
out, you know, what they're going to be packing.

492
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,400
But it will be able to hold up with at least the 360 and PS3 and may even be able to push

493
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,040
better graphics than that, so that's kind of cool.

494
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:01,180
Of course, also it came out that the Wii U will not have a DVD or Blu-ray playback, mainly

495
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,440
because it will actually be used in its own proprietary disk format.

496
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,080
And there also, you know, explains, well, Wii doesn't have DVD or Blu-ray playback capabilities

497
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,440
because, you know, the cost, and also they figured that enough people already have devices

498
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,860
that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray.

499
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,540
Good decision on Nintendo's part or bad?

500
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,800
It's probably true to a certain extent, and also I think it helps them as far as piracy

501
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,960
videos, because if it's their own disk format, you can't pop a, you know, if it's unable

502
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,200
to read DVDs, you can't burn a game onto a DVD.

503
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,320
Or you know, in the case, I mean, these games are going to be multiple gigabytes anyways,

504
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,480
but you can't burn a Blu-ray backup or something like that.

505
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
So it's going to use its own little format there to help...

506
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,520
You're going to have to rip it off a hard drive.

507
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
Alright.

508
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,040
I'm kind of, at first I was surprised.

509
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,740
I was like, wow, they're not going to support a movie format.

510
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
That's kind of shocking.

511
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,520
But then at the same time I was like, well, what Nintendo console really did support a

512
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
movie format?

513
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,440
I mean, GameCube didn't even play CDs.

514
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,400
You know, the Wii certainly doesn't play DVDs unless I guess you do some hacking with it,

515
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,580
which doesn't really count.

516
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,880
But it does Netflix, and I'm sure this new system's going to do the Netflix and the Hulu

517
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
and all that.

518
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,360
And I guess now we're in a different spot with our movies than we were 10 years ago.

519
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,280
I think there's a lot of people that rely on things like Netflix and Hulu and all the

520
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,400
other download things to get their movies.

521
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,200
And I think as long as Nintendo supports Netflix, which I'm sure it will, I think that's going

522
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
to be enough.

523
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
That's probably all it needs.

524
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I mean, the Wii was the best-selling system.

525
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
It didn't even play DVDs.

526
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,160
I always thought it was a little weird to hear that Nintendo might go Blu-ray, because

527
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,600
Blu-ray's a Sony format, and I always thought that was a little weird, you know, whereas

528
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I could see them...

529
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
But you can't really...

530
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,480
I mean, they have their own proprietary format right now, but I don't know.

531
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,960
You kind of either have to make your own or use theirs.

532
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,360
Scott Pilgrim in our chat room says, the Panasonic Q. But the Panasonic Q was Panasonic.

533
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,640
It was the other way around.

534
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
They licensed Nintendo's thing.

535
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It wasn't the other way.

536
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
And besides, you couldn't even get that in America.

537
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,720
Who owned a Panasonic Q?

538
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,800
Not even Dark Sakura owned a Panasonic Q, so therefore no one owns one.

539
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
All right.

540
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,320
Maybe it's under the bed somewhere.

541
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,400
Maybe it's what you're going to get for Christmas this year.

542
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,640
Anyhow, moving on to more information about the current Wii and the DS.

543
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,000
You know, one of the things that was kind of surprising at E3 this year is that there

544
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,880
wasn't a lot of talk about what the heck is coming out on the Wii this year.

545
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,920
But there are some games still slated for the Wii this holiday season.

546
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,040
One of the big ones that barely got any coverage at E3, Kirby Wii, is coming out.

547
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,780
So yeah, Kirby is supposed to be in the fall, out at some point.

548
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,720
Some of the other games that are coming from Nintendo, they're putting out on the Wii.

549
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,320
Wii Play Motion on June 13th, Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave Incident, on June 27th,

550
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,200
Kirby Wii is in the fall, Fortune Street will be during the holiday, of course Zelda Skyward

551
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Sword.

552
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,520
Also, Mario Party 9 and Rhythm Heaven on the Wii are announced for later this year.

553
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,160
Coming out from Nintendo on the DS later this year, not the 3DS, but the DS, Dragon Quest

554
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,240
Monsters, Joker 2, Kirby Mass Attack, Professor Layton and the Last Specter for the fall,

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,000
and Super Fossil Fighters over the holiday.

556
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,740
Some of the other releases on the Wii, let me just kind of throw it out there.

557
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,440
From Sega, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, that will be in November.

558
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,000
Ubisoft is putting out more game show ports, Family Feud 2012 and Price is Right Decades

559
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,240
in September, Just Dance 3 in the fall, WB Interactive has some movie tie-in games, also

560
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,640
the Sesame Street franchise going on there.

561
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,840
And then lastly, Konami has Dance Dance Revolution 2 in the fall, and what's sure to be a favorite

562
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:01,040
here at OLR, Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3 in the fall, woohoo.

563
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:09,120
Anyhow, how about the 3DS and moving forward, obviously the 3DS needs some bigger games

564
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,980
in order to make people really want to get it because the launch titles have not been

565
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
that great.

566
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,680
So, Zelda's out now, which of course was released today, so that was one of the big releases

567
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,120
and there's a lot of people probably going to jump on board finally for that game.

568
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,480
But if not Zelda, then maybe Star Fox 64 3D, which is dated for September 11th, yeah it's

569
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,200
Loki's birthday.

570
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Kid Icarus will be during the holiday, as will Mario Kart and Super Mario, however you'll

571
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,640
have to wait until 2012 to play Lego City Stories and Luigi's Mansion 2.

572
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,560
Not dated yet, Animal Crossing and Paper Mario, so I would assume those games are all the

573
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,840
way out next summer, would be my guess.

574
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,380
Some of the other things that are coming out on the 3DS, Ubisoft is putting out all that

575
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,520
crap that they put out on the DS that sells millions, Pets Fantasy, Horses 3D, Imagine

576
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:10,540
Babies 3D, Raving Rabbids 5, maybe a little more in the direction of stuff we'd actually

577
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,560
play is coming out on the 3DS as well, Konami's putting out Frogger 3D in the fall, they've

578
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,000
dated Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater for the winter, Majesco's got Cooking Mama 4,

579
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Kitchen Magic slated for October 11th, Capcom's got Resident Evil The Mercenaries dated June

580
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,720
28th, I didn't realize that was coming out so soon, Resident Evil Revelations is a little

581
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,080
further out, and then lastly from Activision, they've got Spiderman in the fall and a Transformers

582
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,800
game to support the movie in June.

583
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,400
So there is lots of stuff for the 3DS from the various third parties as well as Nintendo

584
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,120
themselves all the way through the rest of the year.

585
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
So Dark Sakura, going back to the Wii U.

586
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Well, in other Wii U news, they are only doing one controller for it because of some cost

587
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
issue.

588
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:06,360
Basically, Iwata said that they don't want buyers to have to buy multiple Wii U controllers.

589
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,880
And by putting in different aspects of multiplayer that would involve the controller, they would

590
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,240
be pretty much insisting that people buy another Wii U controller and they were trying to cut

591
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,160
down costs for the consumer.

592
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,480
I kind of don't see where that matters.

593
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:29,680
I think just put in a strong single player and then, you know, later on add in.

594
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,480
Here's the problem in my opinion is that the Wii is a party system.

595
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,080
The Wii, especially when it first came out, was that system that got busted out at all

596
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
the parties.

597
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's play Wii Tennis, let's play Mario Party, let's play, you know, Smash Brothers, whatever

598
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
the game was.

599
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,920
It was very much about a lot of those multiplayer experiences.

600
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,000
So it's very surprising that they've kind of said, well, multiplayer is not really going

601
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
to be like that on the Wii U.

602
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,980
I mean, granted, you will be able to use the Wiimote.

603
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,520
You will be able to use the classic controller.

604
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,240
So it's not like multiplayer experiences will be nonexistent.

605
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,920
But when this controller is such a huge factor of what they're trying to drive, it's interesting

606
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,280
that there's not going to be a thing where I could bring my Wii U controller over to

607
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,080
someone else's house and play on that controller.

608
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,780
But it's also not surprising because, remember, that controller is not a processor.

609
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,640
The image that you see on that Wii U controller is not being processed by the controller.

610
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,560
That's the biggest difference between the Wii U setup and what you've probably most

611
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
familiar with leading into this would be the GameCube going to the Game Boy Advance.

612
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,680
The Game Boy Advance has had processors in them.

613
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,740
They could process the data and so forth.

614
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,600
But the Wii U is all streaming from the box.

615
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,720
So it makes sense that it can't maybe stream to more than one, although I think I read

616
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,200
somewhere where it is actually capable of streaming to more than one, but it won't be

617
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
as good.

618
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
I don't know.

619
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,040
But it's going to be interesting.

620
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,640
I think there will be plenty of multiplayer experiences with the Classic Controller involved,

621
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,240
and certainly all the demos they were showing were just the one and the Wiimotes.

622
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,520
But yeah, it's a little disappointing to know that they're not going to try and do more.

623
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,920
But I guess it would be expensive to do that.

624
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,720
I mean, these controllers are probably going to be like a hundred bucks, and I know they've

625
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,000
said they're not going to sell them separately, but what if I lose mine or it's broken?

626
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,840
I think, I honestly don't think the controllers are going to be about a hundred bucks a pop.

627
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,300
I really don't think so.

628
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,800
I think you're maybe looking at, especially since it itself doesn't contain the processor,

629
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,440
I think you're really going to be looking at more around fifty bucks for the controller.

630
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,280
Game Guru in our chatroom says, I think this will kill the Wii U more than anything else.

631
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,520
Again, at the end of the day, it's really all about the games.

632
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,120
I have a really hard time being able to assess Wii U right now, because sure, I saw E3 like

633
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,340
you guys did, and I see the controller and so forth and the demos, but no real games

634
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
were shown.

635
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,400
I mean, maybe like a couple of very loose conceptual things like Ghost Recon and what

636
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,740
have you, but I'm sorry, there's not enough of what are the games really going to look

637
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,000
like on this thing.

638
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
And I don't think we're really going to know that answer until next E3.

639
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,560
So, I feel like I can't really judge this system until I see how does this really play

640
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,080
out or have they been able to think around these constraints really well.

641
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,080
And to Nintendo's credit, I think that's one thing they do really well is that they design

642
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,800
awesome games for the confines that they've built.

643
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
So we'll see.

644
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,060
Frisbee in our chatroom says, congratulations Nintendo, you defeated the entire purpose

645
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,080
to buy this console for its controller.

646
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,720
Can you imagine what families with multiple kids in it fighting over this controller?

647
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,760
Good point.

648
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,960
Gameguru in our chat says, really, they could have gutted a DS for this.

649
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,640
I find it fascinating that we can't use DS's and 3DS's, at least not yet.

650
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,840
Maybe that'll be something that comes out later as more controllers.

651
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm really surprised that it ended up happening.

652
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
We'll see.

653
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,640
You know, I honestly think that that's going to be the big reveal before it's released

654
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,200
is that you get one of the Wii U controllers, but you can also use your other.

655
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,440
I think that's going to be the big thing.

656
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
We'll see.

657
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,480
But, I mean, look at some of the concepts that they've showed off.

658
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,480
New Super Mario Brothers Mii.

659
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,200
We added Miis this time.

660
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm sorry, you don't need a new console to be that cheap.

661
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,640
But hold on, they said, to be fair, they said this is not a game we're announcing.

662
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,240
This is just a demo to show you what the system can do.

663
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
It can do Miis.

664
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,680
Oh my god.

665
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,360
So can the normal Wii.

666
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,640
Why even show that off?

667
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
It was just stupid.

668
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,640
I think the chase Mii and the shield stuff will ultimately get slapped into some mini

669
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,580
game collection that is what the system will come with.

670
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Wii U parties.

671
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,520
Oh yeah, all the tech demos are going to be in the fucking, they're going to be sold at

672
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
some point.

673
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Oh, we're not going to sell these games.

674
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,880
These aren't real games.

675
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,080
No, you're going to sell these games, because this is what you do, Nintendo.

676
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
You're like, hmm, how can we get away with the least amount of work?

677
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,720
Well, we made these tech demos and we're just sitting on them, let's put them together and

678
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,440
charge 50 bucks for them, we'll throw in the Wii remote.

679
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,280
They're going to the Weasley School of Test Design.

680
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,520
The Wheatley School.

681
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,600
I think that Nintendo, they still have a long time before this comes out, and I think they're

682
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,680
going to have a lot of time to respond to some of this criticism.

683
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,520
And I could definitely see Reggie coming out on stage at the next E3 saying, well, we heard

684
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,600
a lot about this that you guys didn't like, so we did this.

685
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,520
Was it contradictions?

686
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,640
We can do that.

687
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,160
We heard that you hate the fact that our analog joysticks, whatever, aren't really joysticks,

688
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
they're just circle pads.

689
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
So you know what we did?

690
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,520
We added more Miis into our games.

691
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,600
Hope you enjoy it.

692
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,760
We listened to the consumers.

693
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
You know what?

694
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,280
We heard that you don't like friend codes, so you know what we're going to do?

695
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,680
We're going to have buddy codes.

696
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,200
They're just like friend codes, but they're buddy codes.

697
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,360
Yeah, we know nothing about online.

698
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
That's the thing.

699
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,000
I can't sit here and tell you I'm going to buy a Wii U or I'm not going to buy a Wii

700
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
U.

701
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,360
And I don't think, honestly, any of you can sit here and tell me that you are or you aren't

702
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,520
buying one, because we don't really know.

703
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,400
We have an idea.

704
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
This is all we've got.

705
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,760
The idea, we see the direction Nintendo's going, but we don't see the path.

706
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,520
And I think they've got a year to really impress us.

707
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,880
Next E3, I'll tell you, if I think the Wii U is for me or not.

708
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
What, Loki?

709
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
You're laughing over there.

710
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,880
I'm just like thinking, you know, the direction that they're going to come out.

711
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,720
It's just going to be the same old shit with another gimmick attached to it.

712
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,120
It's what it really is going to end up, they're going to take you through this elaborate path

713
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,320
of promises and hopes and stuff and then we're just going to get right back to the Wii with

714
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,000
a gimmicky piece of shit that's now another controller for it.

715
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
People love gimmicky pieces of shit.

716
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,520
Why else is the Wii been the number one console?

717
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Number one!

718
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,440
Because it's cheap.

719
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,720
Maybe this will end up being cheap too.

720
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
No it's not.

721
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
I don't know.

722
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,200
It won't be as cheap, but it will be cheap.

723
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Alright.

724
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,400
Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

725
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,840
I feel like we've talked Wii U to death between the E3 shows and so forth.

726
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,880
At least Nintendo's got people talking.

727
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,160
Everybody knows that name now.

728
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,760
They may hate it, but they know it.

729
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,200
Yeah, they know that name because that's all the fucking thing that they...

730
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
That's all they showed.

731
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,120
It was just, hey look, we got this game system that's not coming out for a year and a half.

732
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
I gotta read the...

733
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,480
There's actually a couple really good comments in chat I want to get here now that now we

734
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,160
get some stuff on the Wii U here.

735
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,680
Scott Pilgrim says, I'll buy a Wii U when Mario Kart comes out, if that.

736
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,720
Game Guru says, all of them will be put into Wii U Sports and be packaged with the console,

737
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,720
save New Super Mario Brothers Mii, which will come out separately and sell like 20 million

738
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
copies.

739
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,440
SSJ 100 Matt says, I felt Nintendo was forced into announcing the Wii U right now.

740
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Developers were working on games for it and was starting to leak out.

741
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,960
They had to talk about it, this E3, because they wanted to put their spin on it.

742
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,160
If you think about it, they did the same thing with the Wii revolution.

743
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Yeah.

744
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Agree.

745
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,200
I feel like it was too early, but I understand.

746
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
They had to.

747
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
They had to.

748
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
No, they didn't.

749
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Why'd they have to?

750
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Because it would have been leaked out otherwise.

751
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
It was already leaked out.

752
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
So what?

753
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
We all knew it was a touch pad.

754
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
We all knew.

755
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
So what?

756
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
A big deal.

757
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Yeah.

758
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
It just leaks out.

759
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
You don't have to go and confirm it.

760
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
You can just be motivated.

761
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Investors.

762
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
It's still a wise corporate policy.

763
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
They want people to invest.

764
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,680
They want to convince the world that they're on to the next video.

765
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,080
They want their stocks to go up.

766
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,320
Well, that didn't work.

767
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,640
Well, it went down, so I don't know.

768
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,880
Just looking from a corporate point of view, they have a product there that they don't

769
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,560
want misperceptions on.

770
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,040
They want people to see it the way they want people to see it.

771
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,320
Not just with speculation.

772
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,780
It actually is a wise move on their part to go ahead and say, look, this is what we're

773
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
working on.

774
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,280
We're just going to pull back the curtain a little bit.

775
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,240
But not give us, and basically they've directed the speculation is what they've done.

776
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,680
I honestly think if you take a step back and just look at, you know, what people are talking

777
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,160
about, Twitter, sphere, whatever, good, bad, whatever, you know what they say, whether

778
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,940
they're talking bad or talking good, they're talking about you.

779
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,480
People by far out of this E3 are talking about Wii U and then probably in a distant second

780
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:34,080
the Vita, and then Microsoft doesn't even chart with what they showed.

781
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,400
I mean, to the gamers, yeah, I mean, Halo 4 I guess would be maybe like a way distant

782
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
third.

783
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Whoopity shit.

784
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,800
That's what I say about Halo 4.

785
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,480
And I'm not knocking Microsoft.

786
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,920
I'm just saying they didn't show anything at the press conference that really has people

787
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
buzzing.

788
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,640
And of course they didn't show a new console.

789
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,720
Although they did show that whole cable TV thing, which I thought was going to be a lot

790
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,520
bigger deal than it seems to be.

791
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
But whatever.

792
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Anyhow.

793
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:04,180
SJ100Matt says, if it was leaked out not on their terms, then it would have been misconstrued

794
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
and confused.

795
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,920
So what Jamie said.

796
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,400
GameGuru says, I'm not sure, it depends on if the Wii U's uniqueness can overshadow connect

797
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,040
among the casuals.

798
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,000
Doomplague in chat.orchester.com says, they needed to get the attention of publishers,

799
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,180
developers on board.

800
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,000
That was the whole point of showing the Wii U, in my opinion.

801
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Alright, let's move on.

802
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,840
I want to talk about something that's not Nintendo.

803
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,640
I know it's a three hour show, but there's plenty of other news going on too.

804
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,480
Well, Bungie is celebrating their 20th anniversary.

805
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,620
And of course they're going to reveal some new things about Bungie, including this Bungie

806
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,120
aerospace thing that they've been teasing for a while.

807
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,060
Among that stuff, and actually I think it's available now, if you have an iOS device,

808
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:55,400
you can download an actual application that's free.

809
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
That's kind of neat.

810
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,080
It basically kind of ties in with the Bungie website.

811
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:08,120
It's called Bungie Mobile, and you can check out your stats for Reach and all sorts of

812
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
stuff.

813
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,200
You can sign up for giveaways and...

814
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Downloading?

815
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,480
Yeah, different things like that.

816
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,920
I don't play a lot of Halo, so this isn't really something I'd download, but it's kind

817
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
of cool.

818
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,200
And it's free, and it's available right now, so Bungie Mobile.

819
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Check it out.

820
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,920
Then of course, as something that's a little bit funny, part of this Halo Fest that's going

821
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:39,760
to be going on, I guess they're going to be showing off the Halo Combat Evolved HD.

822
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,040
And with that, they're going to have six custom-made Duke controllers.

823
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,600
Now you remember, the Duke controller is the original Xbox controller, the one that was

824
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,920
the size of a small single-family home.

825
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,640
The size of Duke Nukem's ego.

826
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,480
So they're going to have those made in a very limited run, and they're going to be auctioned

827
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,880
off as well.

828
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,760
And I guess Halo Fest will run alongside PAX Prime from Friday, August 26th to Sunday,

829
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,360
August 28th at the Washington State Convention Center.

830
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,720
Which, by the way, mission is free if you have your PAX badge.

831
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,240
If you want to go play with an original Xbox controller.

832
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,440
Yes.

833
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,440
And have your hands hurt after spending some time with them.

834
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,600
You may throw out your back lifting the controller.

835
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,000
DarkSakura, you hated those old Xbox controllers, didn't you?

836
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,880
Because my hands are smaller.

837
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,920
It really did, it was just painful after a while, but I mean, I can handle a big controller

838
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,560
as long as the ergonomics are reasonable.

839
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,440
Like, Saturn Dual Analog controller, you know, I've told everybody that's my favorite controller

840
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,760
ever, but it's kind of bulky.

841
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,720
But it fits reasonably in the hand, and that's the problem, is that my thumbs just won't

842
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,520
reach.

843
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,920
I never actually touched one of the original Xbox controllers.

844
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,200
By the time I bought an Xbox, I bought...

845
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
I could fix that.

846
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm sure I've mentioned this on the show before, but when I bought an Xbox, I actually bought

847
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,040
a Halo Xbox.

848
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,000
It's a green, translucent kind of Xbox, it's very different from the other ones that are

849
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
out there.

850
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That's the same one we have.

851
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Oh yeah?

852
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,840
Yeah, they were limited edition or something, but it came with Halo.

853
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,560
So believe it or not, when I first played Halo, I loved it.

854
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,920
And yeah, I played it at a wedding.

855
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,840
My friends had got married, and it was a Halo kind of a very subtle Halo theme to the wedding.

856
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,600
And yeah, they were just those kinds of people where it was like, okay, we're married, let's

857
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
play Halo.

858
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,720
And everybody brought TVs, and it was like a local area thing, because obviously Xbox

859
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,040
Live wasn't on the first one.

860
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,280
Oh, like, do you know that that's exactly what my husband's bachelor party was?

861
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Yeah.

862
00:44:52,280 --> 00:45:00,440
Was cases of beer, about eight TVs set up all over my house, and lots of Halo land.

863
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,880
Meanwhile, you remember my party.

864
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Let's watch Xana do and go drink.

865
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
I do, I do.

866
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,880
All right.

867
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,200
Going to our chat room at chat.orangelandsrader.com, Game Guru says, the Duke should be stricken

868
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
from memory.

869
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,800
Controller S was vastly superior.

870
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,520
SSJ100Matt says, the Dreamcast controller was bulky, but it was one of my favorite controllers.

871
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,480
I really liked the Dreamcast controller too.

872
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,680
I loved the whole idea of the VMUs.

873
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,840
It's kind of a bummer that didn't really stick.

874
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,240
I mean, I guess, ironically, some are saying that that's what the Wii U controllers are,

875
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,480
but they're really not.

876
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,440
They're kind of different, because you can't really take that controller and just take

877
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,960
it out by itself and do anything really with it, especially if you step too far away from

878
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,280
the Wii U box.

879
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Anyhow, let's talk about free stuff.

880
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
That's right.

881
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Free games, legal.

882
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,920
This whole thing's illegal free games.

883
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,920
If you're looking for something new to play, you need to look no further and pass Steam.

884
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,240
Steam has added five free-to-play games available on Steam.

885
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,720
You can download them just like anything else.

886
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,240
These are all like free-to-play MMOs.

887
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,400
The games are Spiral Knights, I should say free-to-play games.

888
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,880
They're not all necessarily MMOs.

889
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,600
Spiral Knights, Forsaken Worlds, Champions Online, Free For All, Global Agenda Free Agent,

890
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,200
and Alliance of Valiant Arms.

891
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,480
They are all on Steam right now available for you to download.

892
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,360
I know some people have been checking them out.

893
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,400
I've seen our webmaster, Deep Man, has been playing Spiral Knights.

894
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,320
I saw some of his pictures.

895
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,920
And they got to the point where it was like, hey, you want to keep playing the good stuff?

896
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,680
Now you got to give us money.

897
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:38,080
So that's the only bummer with the free-to-play games is that a lot of them really just feel

898
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:44,000
like extended demos, especially like what was that one on PlayStation 3 that was so

899
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
stupid?

900
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Free Realms, the one where you can play as a fairy and everything is blocked off unless

901
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
you pay for it.

902
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That's why I haven't downloaded anything.

903
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,400
They're just demos.

904
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
But I don't know.

905
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,720
Some people get more out of this.

906
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,480
I hear some of these other ones have a little more robust experience, like Champions Online

907
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,480
and Global Agenda.

908
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,000
A little more of the robust experience, but haven't played it myself.

909
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,440
But if you are looking for something new to try, maybe these things will be up your alley.

910
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Check it out.

911
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,080
Well, I did go to try to find you one of my Xbox controllers.

912
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Oh, really?

913
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,880
And I couldn't find it, but I did find this.

914
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,880
A Sega.

915
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Now see, I never owned a Saturn.

916
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
The Saturn Dual Analog Controller.

917
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,880
I never owned a Saturn.

918
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
Now feel it.

919
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,040
This looks like a mini pizza the way the disc is.

920
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,040
Well, just hold it in both hands for a second, because now you see how natural it feels.

921
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,040
It actually feels super natural.

922
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,120
It's not super natural, but you know what I mean?

923
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,360
Really easy to do.

924
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:40,560
The D-pad's a little weird, kind of like it is on Xbox, but I really like this 360, the

925
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,080
hell's the name of these, the Analog.

926
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,760
In my opinion, it's the best controller ever made.

927
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,200
There you go.

928
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Let me see.

929
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,480
Oh, Loki wants to touch it.

930
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,520
Well, while Loki's touching my controller, I'll go ahead and read the next story.

931
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
How's that sound?

932
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Sure.

933
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,960
Zynga likes to sue people.

934
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,600
Well, now they have another company they're going after called Vostu.

935
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,560
It's a Brazilian company, and they are getting in on Cityville.

936
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,360
They have Vostu's Mega City.

937
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,740
And if you look at the screen captures, it's fairly identical, although I have to say that

938
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:20,760
some of Vostu's in-game sprites actually look a lot nicer.

939
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,760
But they are...

940
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,760
Excuse me.

941
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,680
You're right over there.

942
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,680
All right.

943
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,200
Hey, I told you I'm sick.

944
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,520
But they basically copied everything down, and this is actually in the complaint.

945
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:44,840
And I need to read this, because this is just, like, this is Zynga going, oh, you whore,

946
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
no way.

947
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,720
Vostu has brazenly appropriated the copyright protected aspects of Zynga's games, as well

948
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:59,160
as almost every other aspect of Zynga's business, with scant effort to mask their strategy.

949
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,440
And then offered games virtually identical to Zynga's games to prospective players in

950
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,640
the United States and elsewhere.

951
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:13,800
And they did actually side-by-side video with, you know, cleaning a pet, and the whole video

952
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,280
is here.

953
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:24,160
But they also copied mistakes, so it looks like they're actually copying code.

954
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,440
Things that were already bugs in the games.

955
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:37,680
And like, for example, there was one in Cityville where the requirement that the community buildings

956
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,560
be connected to a road to function, it actually was copied over as a bug into Vostu's game

957
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,960
too.

958
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,280
So there's, it looks like there's quite a bit going on.

959
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,800
The whole lawsuit actually is online.

960
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:03,680
So it looks like they're trying to get them to shut down operations, and if you also look

961
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:13,280
at the, they had to raise $45.9 million in funds, Vostu did, to get their thing going.

962
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,520
So I find this stuff kind of ironic, because didn't Zynga kind of get their start copying

963
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
other people's games?

964
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,280
Like, isn't Farmville taken from Farm Town or something?

965
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:30,800
Well now, here's the other thing, looking at the company's stats too, is that Vostu

966
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:38,840
was founded February 1st, 2007, Zynga was founded July 2007, with more money behind

967
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
them.

968
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Interesting.

969
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,960
And Vostu was located in New York, where Zynga is located in San Francisco.

970
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
So fairly interesting.

971
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,200
It's an East Coast, West Coast thing.

972
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,200
That's right.

973
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,400
It's gonna go down, and it's all gonna go down in Cityville.

974
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,760
There's gonna be drive-by shootings and things.

975
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,600
They're just gonna have to prove, it's basically gonna come down to which code is older, you

976
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
know?

977
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:17,360
But yeah, looking at these photos, and I'll show the chatroom too, it's pretty identical.

978
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,520
Basically Zynga feels pretty confident in this, or they wouldn't be suing, so, you know.

979
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,280
I just find it ironic that it's Zynga accusing someone else of being evil.

980
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,880
So, I'm really sick and tired of Facebook games that keep wanting you to publish shit

981
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,400
and click like and all this stuff.

982
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
It's just such garbage.

983
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,360
You know, there's more of this shit going on too, you remember what I was telling you

984
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:47,840
about on the way to Disneyland, about WTF Forever 21, the blog.

985
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,520
This girl basically was just like, you know, pointing out stuff in the Forever 21 catalog

986
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,360
that was ugly, and you know, blogging about it.

987
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,320
And they're saying that she's copying their stuff, and Forever 21 is a big copier of actual

988
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,360
designers like Anna Sui and, you know, big name designers.

989
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,600
So I thought that was really hilarious.

990
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,680
But it's been, I mean, I can name other companies though that are doing the same thing that's

991
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:23,880
basically like, you know, oh well, we're going to get you for doing nothing that's like what

992
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,880
we're doing.

993
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,760
Breakman in our chatroom takes issue with your story, DarkSakura.

994
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,660
He says, whatever, those two games are completely different.

995
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,880
One is using a completely different shade of brown than the other.

996
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,080
It all comes down to the source code.

997
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,840
It all comes down to the source code.

998
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
We'll see.

999
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,360
All right, anyhow, we're going to move on and cover some release dates and check out

1000
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,640
what is coming out to a gaming store near you very soon.

1001
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,320
We'll start off in, sorry, US.

1002
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,340
In the US state of Japan.

1003
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,360
That's why I almost said Japan because I was bringing up my Japanese dates, but we're not

1004
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
starting there.

1005
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,480
So actually, some decent stuff this week.

1006
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:06,880
Not a whole lot though, I mean, it's still, still a slow time of the year.

1007
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,880
Some EA though, and this is kind of cool, it's kind of a collaboration between, I want

1008
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:23,000
to say, Suda51 and the guy that created Resident Evil, and basically it's Shadows of the Damned,

1009
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,160
kind of a grindhouse-ish, I kind of call it like a grindhouse-ish Dante's Inferno game.

1010
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
It's pretty awesome.

1011
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,880
So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1012
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:47,400
Also I believe that they are re-releasing, in case you don't have Call of Duty Black

1013
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:53,840
Ops, you can get Call of Duty Black Ops now with the first download pack with that, so

1014
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,000
that's going to be out there for 60 bucks as well.

1015
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,680
And then also this week we've got Dungeon Siege 3, that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

1016
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,680
and PC.

1017
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:17,320
Today, or I believe actually no later this week, Wii Play Motion will be coming out from

1018
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,280
Nintendo, and that of course is not a mini-game collection of course, because why would they

1019
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,320
throw tech demos into a game, that will also be coming out with the Wii Remote Plus.

1020
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,080
Cars 2, the video game, tying in with the upcoming movie, it's on all major formats,

1021
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:38,120
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

1022
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:46,320
Also Gods and Heroes of Rome Rising, that's coming out on PC.

1023
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:55,320
There's some PSP 2 packs that are coming out, kind of some cheap games, Kills and Liberation,

1024
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:02,000
Siphon Filters Logan Challenge, that's on PSP for $14.99, not bad.

1025
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,360
And then also they have a couple other collections this week as well, let's see here, I'll get

1026
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,360
back to that.

1027
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:22,200
Anyways, Fear 3 also this week, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

1028
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:29,360
Arma 2 Reinforcements on PC, Dual Pen Sports on the 3DS, which I'm not sure how that works

1029
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,000
considering that the 3DS is not multi-touch.

1030
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:41,160
Pets Fantasy for the 3DS, yes now bringing the ever loved Pets franchise to the 3DS.

1031
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,160
Thank you Ubisoft.

1032
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
Yay.

1033
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,360
Yeah I know everyone's excited about that.

1034
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:56,120
And let's see, I believe that's actually it, a week from today I believe Mystery Case Files

1035
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:04,480
the Malgrave Incident from Nintendo, in case you like that on the DS.

1036
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,880
Alright moving over to Japan and looking at what is coming out on the Japanese releases

1037
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,760
this week, coming out on June 23rd, which by the way also happens to be the 9th birthday

1038
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,840
of OLR, June 23rd.

1039
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,040
Grand Theft Auto IV, the complete edition coming out in Japan, might seem a little late

1040
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,680
but I believe those releases are localized for Japan so they have to go back and redo

1041
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,720
the text and the acting and all that stuff.

1042
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,920
So that is coming out finally this week, that is the big release on Xbox 360.

1043
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,960
Coming out on PlayStation 3 this week on the 23rd, some more choices for you.

1044
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,100
Mass Effect 2, the Japanese release is out this week as well as of course the Grand Theft

1045
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,640
Auto IV collection.

1046
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,640
Bleach Soul Ignition out from Sony this week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

1047
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:52,160
And lastly a game called Meru no Atlier, Arland no Reken Jutsuji comes out this week from

1048
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,000
Gust, and I don't know if this is a game that is out here.

1049
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yes it is.

1050
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Is it?

1051
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
What is this?

1052
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,240
Is this the, oh Atlier, they do have the Atlier series out here, so this is like a role playing

1053
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,240
game.

1054
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,180
I think we have one of these at home we haven't played yet, like the last one in the series.

1055
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,680
That's on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1056
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,100
And then moving on to some of the other consoles.

1057
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:20,680
Going to the Nintendo Wii this week, actually let me do the PSP first, Gloria Union this

1058
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,680
week and Gundam Memories, Tataki no Kyoku comes out this week.

1059
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,560
And trying to see if there's anything on the Wii.

1060
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:34,200
Earth Seeker comes out this week, sorry that is not the same thing as Earthbound, but there

1061
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,720
is a game called Earth Seeker that's coming out this week.

1062
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,280
This looks like kind of like an RPG-ish type of game, but with the Wii graphics.

1063
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,040
Whatever happened to The Last Guardian, I thought they were going to announce that at

1064
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,040
E3 this year for the Wii.

1065
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,040
That's supposed to be a kick-ass game on the Wii.

1066
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,640
From The Last Guardian?

1067
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,040
No not The Last Guardian, dammit no, I'm thinking that's the PlayStation 3.

1068
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,360
What am I thinking of?

1069
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,120
There's some big role playing game from Mistwalker.

1070
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,120
Last Story.

1071
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Thank you, Last Story.

1072
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,120
One word difference.

1073
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Completely different games though.

1074
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,760
Yeah sorry, my bad.

1075
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,920
All right, Nintendo 3DS Japan this week, Fish Eyes 3D, at least it's not Fish Heads 3D,

1076
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,720
Fish Eyes 3D and Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions come out this week.

1077
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,160
Fishing games are huge in Japan, I'm telling you, this is what Fish Eyes is, it's a fishing

1078
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
game.

1079
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,440
And it looks like it takes like real scenes, like this very tranquil little lake in the

1080
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,640
woods and then you can just rope in these dead fish.

1081
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,720
Well who would want to rope in dead fish?

1082
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,720
Oh no, you rope them in while they're alive and kicking and then they die when they're

1083
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,960
sitting in the styrofoam container.

1084
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,880
All the radiation in the water killed them.

1085
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,320
Kidding, I'm kidding, gosh, gosh, all right.

1086
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,320
That's very insensitive of you.

1087
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,560
I was completely insensitive, but all right, let's move on.

1088
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,080
Okay, on the 24th we have Dream Trigger 3D for 3DS, this is their UK releases.

1089
00:58:54,080 --> 00:59:02,500
Fear 3 for PlayStation 3 PC, Xbox 360, Get Fit with Mel B, Who Cares, Gods and Heroes

1090
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:09,080
Room Rising, Let's Dance with Mel B, Who Else Cares, Shadows of the Damned, Call of Duty

1091
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:15,480
Black Ops Annihilation Pack, sorry that was the 28th, my bad, done.

1092
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,920
All right, it's a quick week.

1093
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,620
Some more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer takes

1094
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,200
a stroll through the classic game archives and she will in just a moment.

1095
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,080
I could not find my controller by the way, I tried to find you an old controller.

1096
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:34,280
I melted it down and made two of the other controllers out of it.

1097
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
I think we actually did get rid of them.

1098
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,280
I don't know.

1099
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,280
All right, moving on.

1100
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,720
Melted it down to two full-size station wagons.

1101
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,640
So since we were talking about lawsuits with Zynga, let's talk about lawsuits with Infinity

1102
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,640
Ward and Activision.

1103
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:52,800
Yeah, I remember them, they were suing each other back and forth and good luck for both

1104
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,140
of them because both lawsuits in either direction were approved.

1105
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:07,120
So the lawsuit filed against Activision by Infinity Ward is moving forward and I guess

1106
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,760
that the claims have merit.

1107
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,080
Also apparently the judge has allowed the countersuit to move forward as well.

1108
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,880
So it'll be interesting to see how that pans out.

1109
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:25,600
And then since we're talking about Activision here and everybody loves Bobby Kotick, Bobby

1110
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:43,280
Kotick actually has a cameo as I guess a manager of a baseball team in Moneyball, the new Brad

1111
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,080
Pitt movie about the Oakland A's.

1112
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,160
Wait, wait, they made a movie about the Oakland A's?

1113
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Yeah.

1114
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Why?

1115
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:59,000
Because there was this coach that came in and changed the way they do drafting or whatever

1116
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,600
and it was a big deal.

1117
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,640
Why don't they make a movie about a good baseball team?

1118
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,640
Why don't they make a movie about the Giants?

1119
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,440
Field of Dreams.

1120
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,000
A League of Their Own.

1121
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,400
I'd be more interested in seeing A League of Their Own again and watching a movie about

1122
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,200
the Oakland A's.

1123
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,720
Moving on, one more story for you guys and this has been all over the press this week.

1124
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,360
I'm sure you guys have heard, but some of your favorite gaming websites were hacked.

1125
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,720
That's right, Bethesda was hacked earlier this week and yeah, Bethesda apparently had

1126
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,200
200,000 user accounts compromised there.

1127
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,440
So yeah, be careful if you were a member of Bethesda's forums.

1128
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,120
Also the same hackers took down Minecraft, Eve Online, and the Escapist Magazine.

1129
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,680
A lot of this was from denial of service attacks, a very popular way to bring down websites

1130
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,680
out there.

1131
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,640
Eve Online was taken offline for several hours as was the Escapist Magazine online.

1132
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,240
I think Minecraft was down for a little bit, but they came back up pretty quick.

1133
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,280
So just good rule of thumb here, the same hacker group released I think 62,000 login

1134
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,000
and passwords.

1135
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,420
Don't use the same password on Bethesda's website or Square Enix's forums or whatever

1136
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,640
gaming forums you log into.

1137
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,360
Don't use the same password there that you use on PayPal.

1138
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,560
This is a real chance for you to evaluate the passwords that you use and we kind of

1139
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,360
throw this out there as a warning to those out there that don't want to end up in the

1140
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,720
same boat because you know what we say on the show, I'm not condoning what these guys

1141
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,040
are doing, but you know the old saying, hackers are going to hack and for whatever the reason,

1142
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,800
whether it be they're trying to make a point or trying to steal money or whatever it is.

1143
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:56,600
So just make sure you don't use the same password for your banking that you do on the

1144
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,040
Orange Islands Radio forums even.

1145
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:05,060
Because I'll tell you what, PHPBB is what we use and what a lot of different websites

1146
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:09,820
use and if you, those things I'm sure can get hacked pretty easy.

1147
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:14,040
So don't use the same password on anything like that that you would use for your bank

1148
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
or your PayPal.

1149
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,400
Have different passwords.

1150
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,520
This public service announcement brought to you by us.

1151
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,520
Yes.

1152
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,360
Alright, moving on, let's get into some classic gaming.

1153
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,360
We're going to take a stroll down memory lane.

1154
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,220
DarkSakura has picked a classic game or games as the case may be tonight that she's going

1155
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,440
to highlight as the classic game of the week.

1156
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:40,240
It's the one and only true love for this week in gaming.

1157
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,360
DarkSakura, what should the kids out there be playing this week?

1158
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,360
Contra.

1159
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,800
I selected the Contra series.

1160
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,920
Right, because I think you did the Contra game a while ago, but now we've got the whole

1161
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
damn series.

1162
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,440
Okay, I don't remember doing Contra, but okay.

1163
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,360
So yeah, basically it's, the series started in 1987.

1164
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:04,000
It's a run and gun style shooter and it came out as Contra and then we had the really super

1165
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,320
Contra in 1988 and a bunch of other Contras.

1166
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:14,880
And now this is actually just my old Japanese studies that makes me pretty giddy is that

1167
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:22,400
it was, in Japanese it was written out in Ateji which is like using the kanji but for

1168
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,400
their pronunciation.

1169
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,200
So I thought it was pretty interesting.

1170
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,240
And it actually, the first one came out after, the arcade one, came out after the I ran Contra

1171
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,760
affair and people were like, well is this about that?

1172
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,520
And there was an ending theme, it was called Sandinista.

1173
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,560
I don't know if anyone remembers the whole Contras and Sandinista thing.

1174
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,720
I remember it.

1175
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,840
So yeah.

1176
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:58,440
The original is side scrolling but you've got a few 3D view areas is what they were

1177
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,400
called where it's behind you and then a couple of overhead ones like in Super Contra and

1178
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,200
Contra 3 the Alien Wars.

1179
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:13,080
There, the ones that deviated were the ones that were done by Appaloosa which was Contra

1180
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,200
like Sea of War, Sea of the Contra Adventure and Neo Contra.

1181
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:25,880
Contra Shattered Soldier had the side view but it was all rendered in 3D.

1182
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:32,680
And then basically they were all two player except for the MSX2 version of Contra and

1183
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,200
Operation Sea for the Gameboy.

1184
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,720
Those were only single player.

1185
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:43,880
So you get different weapons and you can replace your regular gun with a laser gun or a spread

1186
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:49,200
gun, rapid bullets, they increase your fire speed.

1187
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:55,640
You can also get the mega shell in Super Contra or bombs in Contra 3 and Contra hardcore.

1188
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:01,680
There's all kinds of neat stuff but the biggest thing about Contra is that it was hard and

1189
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,120
for the record the NES version of Contra does use the Konami code.

1190
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,000
It gives you 30 lives instead of 3.

1191
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,960
Probably the most infamous game to use the Konami code because you couldn't really beat

1192
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
it without it.

1193
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,720
I mean let's be real.

1194
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,540
Most of the other ones had the extra lives codes in the Japanese releases such as Contra

1195
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:24,140
Spirits which was Contra 3 over here and Contra hardcore.

1196
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:31,960
So the games in the series we have Contra which is on Arcade, MSX2, DOS, C64, CPC, ZX

1197
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:38,280
and then Super Contra, Arcade, NES, DOS and Amiga, Operation Sea on Gameboy, Contra 3

1198
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:45,400
the Alien Wars which was SNES, Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, Contra Force on the NES, Contra hardcore

1199
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,320
which was on Genesis slash Mega Drive, Contra Legacy of War on Playstation and Saturn which

1200
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,520
I think we have the Saturn one of that I want to say.

1201
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:59,480
See the Contra Adventure on Playstation, Contra Shattered Soldier on PS2, Neo Contra on PS2,

1202
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,120
Contra 4 on Nintendo DS.

1203
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:09,040
That was done by WayForward technology and it actually had two screens that you know

1204
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:14,040
because it was a DS you had different kinds of views that you could use.

1205
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:22,040
There was Contra Rebirth that was done by M2 for WiiWare and Hardcore Uprising which

1206
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:28,080
was on PS3, Xbox 360 and that's a downloadable title released this year.

1207
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:35,120
There were re-releases of Contra and Super Contra, there were DOS ports, there was the

1208
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:45,440
Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 is the X Spectrum and in Europe it came out as Gryzor.

1209
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,920
There are actually mobile phone versions to Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade.

1210
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,280
As far as cancelled games there was Contra Spirit 64 which was in development by Konami

1211
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:04,200
of Osaka however it was cancelled when the development team disbanded and that was being

1212
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,240
worked on in 1998.

1213
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:15,640
For other ones, I love this game Konami YY World which is on Famicom, it actually had

1214
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:21,400
the same boss theme that was used in the original Contra and it came out right before Contra.

1215
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:31,160
YY World 2, SOS, Parsley Joe, Bill Rizer is a playable character in there, Snatcher.

1216
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:37,160
The two characters Bill and Lance go to a Konami themed party held at the Outer Heaven

1217
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:45,400
Show Pub and they are replaced by Light and Pastel from Twinbee but in the 32 bit version

1218
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,240
of the game there's a Contra ad in there.

1219
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:52,760
There's Nanobreaker, Jaguar from Neocontra is a hidden character, Best Student Council

1220
01:08:52,760 --> 01:09:00,260
which is a TV anime produced by Konami, there was a character called Lance Bean who was

1221
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,200
a mod to a Contra character.

1222
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:15,760
Palaparokun Pocket 8 had a Contra parody in it, Silent Hill Shattered Memories is in a

1223
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:21,680
movie theater that has Konami arcade machines including the original Contra and if you make

1224
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:28,160
care you stare at it he'll go some real classics and then Rocket Knight when you play as Gold

1225
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:36,680
Sparkster it has Bill Rizer shooting the spread gun at Gold Sparkster when he flies away.

1226
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:42,480
These were all set in the 27th century, well the initial Contra and the sequels had Bill

1227
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:48,520
Rizer and Lance Bean who were modeled after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone

1228
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,640
and then they were named after actors that were in Aliens as in Bill Paxton and Paul

1229
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:03,080
Rizer so and then Lance Henriksen and Michael Bean for Lance Bean so I thought that was

1230
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,080
neat and then after that it sort of deviated and had different people and then Contra Shattered

1231
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:16,680
Soldier brought back Bill Rizer who was a war criminal and then Neocontra also had him

1232
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,920
in there too but it was a clone, oh well, spoilers!

1233
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:32,480
As far as differences in the different versions there were some changes in between the Japanese

1234
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:39,400
and US ones mostly in character naming and who the characters were supposed to be and

1235
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:45,620
there were also different you know bad guys who were named different like the Red Falcon

1236
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:53,800
was actually the Tenoki Gabba was what his name was, the Emperor Demon Gabba and then

1237
01:10:53,800 --> 01:11:00,800
there was Mad Dog and Scorpion were given to Bill and Lance in the NES versions.

1238
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:08,320
When it came out in Europe and Australia it was called Probotector and they were robots

1239
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:17,240
so they weren't Bill and Lance and then different versions came out as I said earlier as Gryzor

1240
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:22,800
and then Super Protector Alien Rebels which is Contra through the Alien Wars.

1241
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:32,480
For Game Boy they were also put out as Probotector and then the Wii versions were released as

1242
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:42,200
Probotector in the UK, Contra 4 did not get released in Europe but Probotector was in

1243
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:46,040
the game as in character so that's it.

1244
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,360
Good Lord that's a lot of Contra!

1245
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,360
Yeah.

1246
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,520
But it's a great series, hard as hell.

1247
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
No seriously.

1248
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,640
But very rewarding if you can actually make your way through the games so.

1249
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,640
Seriously.

1250
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,720
Alright we're going to take a break guys but don't go anywhere because we're going to be

1251
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,440
back with more of Orange Lounge Radio including some rapid fire news, your Twitter topics

1252
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,920
so get those in Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you have something you want us to talk about

1253
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,280
or any questions for us tonight.

1254
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,900
We're going to talk about Kinect making its way to the PC, we're going to talk a little

1255
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,400
more about that Silent Hill collection that was announced at E3, some more details coming

1256
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,840
out on that and Nintendo's stance on free to play games, we're going to talk a little

1257
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,840
more about that.

1258
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:30,120
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1259
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,560
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1260
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:38,960
We are live with episode number 416 of our show on this June 19th, 2011.

1261
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,960
You know what next week is?

1262
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,040
It's going to be June 26th, 2011 and that's the closest show to our 9th birthday as a

1263
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,160
station June 23rd or I should say as a show.

1264
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,280
We used to have a station on Life is Five but then of course we folded that a few years

1265
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,280
ago.

1266
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,320
Hence our new home at All Games which we like.

1267
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,740
So yeah, that is all going to be next week.

1268
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:04,480
Not doing anything special guys, 9 is like a weird number and you know we thought maybe

1269
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,560
it would be better to save something really cool for 10 years.

1270
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,320
We should open up with rum stain.

1271
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,440
We're hoping we can get like a guest or something you know to come in and have fun with us but

1272
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,600
we're not really planning on anything like super huge.

1273
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,580
There just comes a point where celebrating too much is just too much.

1274
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:24,720
Like okay, we had a 5 year show, we had a 300, a 400, you know 9 years, whatever.

1275
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,840
So that's that.

1276
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,120
So we'll be here next week of course with that.

1277
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,200
If you wanted to wish us happy birthday, a great way to do that of course would be to

1278
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,360
rate us on iTunes with a 5 star review because that helps other people notice the show or

1279
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,360
just spread the word.

1280
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,640
We always say at the end of the show, spread the word about the show.

1281
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
Send a tweet.

1282
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,440
I saw somebody made a very nice Facebook post this week pointing us to the Orange Lounge

1283
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,440
Radio Facebook.

1284
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,440
I thought that was great.

1285
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,280
So all that stuff always really helps.

1286
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,280
It goes a long way.

1287
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,980
During the break, Loki was asking me about why didn't I mention Child of Eden during

1288
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,800
my gaming week because I've made it no secret on the show before.

1289
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:05,520
I'm a huge fan of Q and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, obviously the Reds, Space Channel, Luminous,

1290
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,720
shit I even loved every extent Extra Extreme.

1291
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,700
I still say 99 Nights wasn't as bad as y'all made it out to be but maybe that's a little

1292
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,960
bit of fanboy isn't there.

1293
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,040
But I did not play Child of Eden this week.

1294
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,000
Long story short, I was basically reminded that I had a birthday coming up and maybe

1295
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,140
I shouldn't make any game purchases until my birthday has passed.

1296
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,600
For those that don't know, my birthday happens to also be next Sunday.

1297
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,480
My birthday was 3 days after the original OLR on June 23rd.

1298
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,120
So yeah, my birthday is right around this time too.

1299
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,440
So I have to wait until then and then maybe there will be a gift card or something I can

1300
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,120
use to go get it.

1301
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,000
But Loki and I were talking a little bit about some of the reviews and things we've heard

1302
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,740
about the game and how some people are dog and child of Eden for being only 90 minutes.

1303
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:50,440
Now I hear it, again, I haven't played it, I can only go off what I've heard and my intense

1304
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:54,400
bias towards Q and everything that Tetsuya Mizuguchi touches.

1305
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,760
But I hear it's an amazing 90 minutes.

1306
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,760
Like that it's just like a great 90 minutes a game.

1307
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,600
They said it will bring you to tears.

1308
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,880
It will bring you to tears.

1309
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,840
Well the original Rez was an amazing game too and it was probably only about 90 minutes.

1310
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,240
Now granted games didn't cost 60 bucks back then.

1311
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,560
The only thing that brings me to tears is the fact that I forgot to send in Josh's picture

1312
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,800
when they were doing picture submissions because that would have been awesome.

1313
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,000
I didn't even realize, I forgot that was there.

1314
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,960
So I've been trying to stay spoiler free so please don't spoil or whatever.

1315
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,040
But Loki and I were kind of talking a little bit about the whole 90 minutes thing and Loki

1316
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,160
you feel that 90 minutes, paying 60 bucks for a 90 minute experience is okay.

1317
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:39,640
Which is funny to hear from you because usually you're the first one to dog people that are

1318
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,520
wanting to price gouge and all that stuff.

1319
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,040
But if it's a damn good 90 minutes then it might be worth the cost, right?

1320
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,040
Exactly.

1321
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,920
I mean the way I look at it is like shooters.

1322
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,280
Shooters that are out there, I'm not talking about first person shooters, I'm talking about

1323
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,720
arcade games.

1324
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:02,360
They're not 30 hours long, they're like a few hours if that.

1325
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,720
It's a full fleshed out game.

1326
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,940
You don't need a whole lot of story with this stuff so you don't need to spend extra time

1327
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:17,740
for story development and whatnot but if it's a good entertaining 90 minutes it's better

1328
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,120
than a boring 6 hours or a boring 30 hours.

1329
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,680
I mean you might spend 60 bucks to go to an awesome concert.

1330
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:31,720
Like I probably spent over 100 bucks to go see Lady Gaga and that was a pretty awesome

1331
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,960
90 minutes.

1332
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,200
But all joking aside, obviously reviewers are going to react differently and so forth.

1333
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,640
But see that's the thing, that's my problem with some of these reviewers nowadays, it's

1334
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:49,320
like they kind of forgot how games were or they forgot how things are.

1335
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,800
They're like oh this isn't as good as Call of Duty so I don't like it.

1336
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,960
I don't understand that.

1337
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,420
Let me play devil's advocate a little bit here though is that the game marketplace isn't

1338
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,680
what it used to be.

1339
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,640
And to be fair there's a lot of games out there that have intense replayability value

1340
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,080
that go for 99 cents like Angry Birds.

1341
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,520
I understand that but at the same time you can't judge a first person shooter by the

1342
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,240
same criteria as a music game.

1343
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:16,800
I mean they have different intents and purposes and I think comparing-

1344
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,980
I thought you said it was a shooter.

1345
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:18,980
What is it?

1346
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,240
Is it a shooter or is it a music game?

1347
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,840
No it's not a first person shooter.

1348
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,840
That's different.

1349
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,720
You can judge first person shooters against other first person shooters and granted you

1350
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:35,800
can judge different elements of it like this has good production value and stuff like that.

1351
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:44,560
But you can't say oh because this shooter slash music game is not like as long as Final

1352
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,600
Fantasy 13 well I'm going to have to rate it lower or something.

1353
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,100
But see once again though it kind of- here's the way I look at it.

1354
01:17:54,100 --> 01:18:00,520
If you're looking to reviews and reviewers for you know your decision on whether you

1355
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,440
purchase a game or not here's what you need to do.

1356
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:09,200
You need to search out reviews for games that you like or games that you have interest in

1357
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:14,960
and find the reviewers that are sharing your same dislikes or likes with these games and

1358
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,960
when you find a reviewer that kind of thinks like you do then you'll know whether to trust

1359
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,040
that person's opinion or not because at the end of the day you know an IGN review that's

1360
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,640
one person's opinion that's one person's opinion that you're holding so much weight against

1361
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:33,800
because it's IGN.com it's one dude I mean hell if I said I hate this game I hate Madden

1362
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,960
does that mean Madden is terrible no it doesn't mean Madden is terrible means I don't like

1363
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:42,920
Madden a perfect example Minecraft we have all said on the show we don't understand Minecraft

1364
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,720
like I've tried to play Minecraft and I was like this is not fun for me but I looked at

1365
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:53,520
it and I went I see how it's fun for someone else but like someone with more of that you

1366
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,440
know creative mind that wants to build things and and so forth I was like I was I was done

1367
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,880
with Minecraft it's like people rating movie tie-in games it's like people rating children's

1368
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:08,040
games they don't fucking care because they're like I don't want to rate you know I don't

1369
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,400
want to be reviewing the Green Lantern game when I could be playing you know something

1370
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:17,580
way better than this and so a lot of times it seems like that that comes out it's not

1371
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:23,960
a unbiased opinion and sometimes I think that they just dog on the game so badly because

1372
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:30,040
it's funny and people will you know link to that article some page it's just because you

1373
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:34,920
know such as the websites that gave Duke Nukem Forever a zero like you know I again I haven't

1374
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:40,720
played Duke Nukem Forever but a zero like I don't think I can trust a website they get

1375
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,760
I mean again I haven't played it so maybe I need to bite my tongue but I just kind of

1376
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:49,000
get the sense even from the demo I played I can't possibly imagine I could trust a website

1377
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,480
that gave Fusion Frenzy 2 a higher score than Duke Nukem Forever because Fusion Frenzy 2

1378
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:59,520
is the worst game I've played this generation and and also you know just some once again

1379
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,080
like I said it's it's all about whether Bomberman 0 I take that back Bomberman 0 is the worst

1380
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,960
game I played this generation it's all about you know whether you agree with the person

1381
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,240
who's reviewing stuff like there are certain video movie reviewers out there that you may

1382
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:18,000
have you may share the same opinion with you know Roger Deibert as opposed to some other

1383
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,880
guy you know or vice versa I mean it it's all about finding the reviewer that you know

1384
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:30,840
it makes sense to you or or what you can do is instead of worrying about wasting a lot

1385
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,260
of money you know what guess what you can go now to red box machines and you can rent

1386
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:40,120
a game for two dollars for a night so you know what you can get a taste of the game

1387
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,360
or you can play a demo or you can rent it at a you know traditional video rental place

1388
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,600
or you can do it through Gamefly or wherever and you don't spend you know sixty dollars

1389
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,360
on a game you can check it out and if you like it cool you buy it if not then you didn't

1390
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,880
waste that much money let me get some comments from chat.orangelaunceter.com as we are taping

1391
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,740
live on this Sunday night break man in our chat room says for 90 minutes of fun a hooker

1392
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,720
would charge you a lot more money so this is actually a good deal speaking of child

1393
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:09,320
of Eden that's right I did learn how to learn that from watching cat house girls is that

1394
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:14,000
the Air Force Amy or whatever her name was would charge probably several hundred dollars

1395
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,720
for 90 minutes of fun. I have a feeling that the people in that cat house charge a lot

1396
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:25,800
more than your traditional hooker because they're you know in Vegas and shit but yes

1397
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:30,780
no no that was that was the bunny ranch that was that's a past Reno oh my mistake well

1398
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:35,080
still Nevada I mean they figure people gambling have a lot of money so we could drive to the

1399
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:42,200
bunny ranch we should we should take your wife out to the bunny ranch someday she one

1400
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:49,480
of her aspirations in life was to get a prostitution license at some point for for Nevada just

1401
01:21:49,480 --> 01:22:01,480
that just to have a hard and put it you know so you know oh boy I and to read Saddam Hussein's

1402
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:08,400
romance novels that he wrote those are two of her aspirations I think your wife needs

1403
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,600
a podcast like not about games but I think your wife just needs a podcast called like

1404
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:18,180
Nellie streams and every week she could talk about a dream of hers a lot of the stuff that

1405
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,720
we talk about ends up on Facebook anyways especially if we say something funny like

1406
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,520
last night I was saying something to her and to her a lot of the stuff I say sounds like

1407
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:35,200
mumbling and so she'll say you said this or you know it's usually said you called me an

1408
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:41,000
n-word no no that's not what I said at all I don't remember what the hell I actually

1409
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,680
said it was not even close all right let's move on we're gonna get to some rapid fire

1415
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:23,000
of Warcraft which isn't for everyone and that's fine I understand that game isn't for everyone

1416
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,680

Horde house in Azeroth Hordehouse.com that's the show I do with Xtaphir about the World

about the upcoming patch that still has not come out that may not come out on Tuesday

1421
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:53,240

1422
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,520
let's move on and get into some rapid fire news lots of new gaming stories throughout

1423
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,920
the week we don't always have time to spend five minutes on all of them let's talk quickly

1424
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,000
about some of the things you might otherwise miss Loki so EA is trying something out they

1425
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,200
decided to open a retail store for EA Sports in the Charlotte Airport and of course you

1426
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:17,200
know if you've been to airports they have a lot of stores you can waste money and time

1427
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,280
in because you know people are waiting for their flights especially when they're told

1428
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:25,720
to get to the airports you know three hours early or two hours early and oh guess what

1429
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,520
that security line wasn't as long as they said it was and now you have to hang around

1430
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,120
and maybe you need some gifts for your friends and whatnot so they're going to be doing that

1431
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:41,440
and I guess kind of as a test to see if this is something that would take off other places

1432
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:46,080
I don't know it's a neat idea but I don't think you're going to see this really anywhere

1433
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:53,880
else because you know everybody carries EA Sports stuff so I don't know but I mean those

1434
01:24:53,880 --> 01:25:01,100
theme type stores are pretty popular in airports so makes sense now this is kind of interesting

1435
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:05,920
never thought I would see a sequel to this game but apparently Namco is doing a new Namco

1436
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,000
Generations game and that game is Dancing Eyes and Dancing Eyes was an arcade game it

1437
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,120
came out I think in the 2000s is basically kind of I think it was based on like the Playstation

1438
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:24,600
1 or something like that but it was a 3D poly kind of a almost like a gals panic or kicks

1439
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:30,640
type game you had a grid that was around usually a woman or it could be something funny and

1440
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:36,840
as you you know connected the dots or connected the lines around a shape that shape would

1441
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,840
disappear and reveal either the scantily clad woman underneath or you know in some cases

1442
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:48,640
a cow or a person or who knows titties no there were there was no nudity in any of these

1443
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,640
games but after you did get done though you got the they played the you know the kind

1444
01:25:53,640 --> 01:26:02,480
of burlesque horn music or whatever oh it's like Sharon Christine Aguilera something like

1445
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:09,920
that and so they're going to be putting out a new game now for the Namco Generations he

1446
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,560
used to play this game at Arcade Infinity actually I did play this and I actually have

1447
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,600
it on my arcade cabinet at home I played I've played it in MAME and it's fun it's it's it's

1448
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:28,280
not you know it's not an adult game I mean it's sort of could I guess it's it's PG-13

1449
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:35,520
yeah I mean you reveal like women wearing bikinis or you know a girl dressed up like

1450
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,880
a cat you know a cat girl or something oh my gosh not a cat girl you're playing as a

1451
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:46,520
monkey and you run around you're trying to avoid you know different enemies that are

1452
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,760
running around the screen stuff so you're supposed to dodge them and they actually have

1453
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:56,880
some screenshots here see it's basically just you know running around like a woman's you

1454
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:03,200
know shirt and it's revealing her bra underneath so that's coming out in PlayStation 3 oh 96

1455
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:11,960
is when it came out in the arcade that was 2000 but neat also they're going to be doing

1456
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:21,760
a game of or a new version of Metro Cross as Arrow Cross I guess so that's kind of neat

1457
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,360
and then finally I guess this is good news for people that are looking for a new Psychonauts

1458
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:34,880
game but Double Fine is now obtaining the rights to publish a new Psychonauts game and

1459
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:42,560
of course you know it came out back in 05 and Tim Schafer you know says Double Fine's

1460
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:48,120
always owned the intellectual property rights for Psychonauts franchise but we've and we

1461
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:53,380
so we've been free to pursue movies sequels etc says what changed recently is the publishing

1462
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:57,960
rights to the game Psychonauts have reverted to Double Fine and some of the deals still

1463
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,760
need to be finalized this means anything financially when that happens we'll have more to announce

1464
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:12,880
so all right neat well moving on to Xbox Live you might have caught the indie games uprising

1465
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,600
last winter it was a way for the indie games on Xbox Live to get more exposure in fact

1466
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,560
there was a little bit of back and forth because it was something that the community kind of

1467
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,200
came up with the Microsoft at first didn't really support it but they finally came around

1468
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,480
and they did kind of give it some ad space and so forth calling attention to it well

1469
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,960
it's coming back for the summer it's going to start on August 22nd and run through September

1470
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,840
12th two games will be released each week and it's all going to be based on votes starting

1471
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,520
July 4th you can vote on what titles you believe should be featured obviously a big problem

1472
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,880
with Xbox Live marketplace in the indie game section is that it's really hard to get noticed

1473
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:54,560
on there right now so this will be a way to get visibility for some of those games so

1474
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,640
we'll see what happens there submissions if you think if you are an indie developer you

1475
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,520
know an indie developer that might want to get in on this you can submit through June

1476
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:09,600
24th so that's not very much more time so you might want to get on that moving on speaking

1477
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,040
of Xbox one of the big things that was shown at the Microsoft press conference this year

1478
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:20,200
was the fabled the journey demonstration well a very interesting quote from Peter Molyneux

1479
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:27,440
this week about it this was in an interview with official Xbox magazine quote I made a

1480
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:33,480
horrendous mistake on the press demo in taking out the navigation allowing players to move

1481
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:39,640
I'll state on record now that fable the journey is definitely not on rails and there's this

1482
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,560
whole thing where there's I guess he met with all these journalists and he made them sign

1483
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:52,120
the board for it said it is not on rails and all this stuff so a horrendous mistake and

1484
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,940
I have to agree they made a huge mistake not showing that you could navigate it did look

1485
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:04,520
like rails so they should have said something about that but who knows we'll see more about

1486
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,200
this when it gets a little closer to release by the way the reason why they did what they

1487
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,920
did they wanted to showcase the game's action like using the magic attacks and the whole

1488
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,640
horse and carriage and all that stuff because the unreal or the non on rails part wasn't

1489
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:23,160
finished yet one of the other big pieces to come out of e3 was that you're gonna get a

1490
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:29,280
free game if you have a 3ds you're gonna get the four swords the Legend of Zelda four swords

1491
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:33,120
that is going to be coming out for free a little later this year it's supposed to be

1492
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:38,160
out in September according to Nintendo well just to clarify it did come out this week

1493
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:42,760
that the version you're going to be getting is the Game Boy Advance version because there's

1494
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:48,040
no real way to do the GameCube emulation I'm assuming on the 3ds right now the Game Boy

1495
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:53,000
Advance version is the version that you will be able to get on the 3ds no word yet about

1496
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,320
if it's going to be enhanced at all kind of like excite bike had very minimal thrills

1497
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,660
to kind of enhance it for widescreen and so forth no word if that's going to be given

1498
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:07,320
the same treatment for Zelda for four swords or possibly even maybe online that might just

1499
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,840
be wishful thinking I don't know but it is the Game Boy Advance version that you're gonna

1500
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:16,720
get for free later this year and I guess free is not such a bad deal unless it's yours dark

1501
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:22,160
soccer you have some rapid fire stuff for us I do for portal to there's some download

1502
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:27,480
content coming out this is the six cents motion pack but it only works with the razor hydro

1503
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:32,440
motion controller you can actually get the pack of course through steam you can get the

1504
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:37,720
controller through steam as well as 140 bucks but it comes with a copy of portal 2 and a

1505
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:44,600
download content of course if you already have portal 2 then you have a gift for a friend

1506
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:51,020
then in other news there is the Super Mario Brothers 3 fan remake I think we've covered

1507
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:57,200
it before but there's a 2 version 2.0 out that has much better improved graphics especially

1508
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:05,360
in the background and 84 bonus rooms a new final castle and 30 different cameos so there's

1509
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:11,760
a footage of it up on YouTube if you go find it it's Super Mario Brothers 3 version 2.0

1510
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,320
and then I actually watched some of the video and it does look really nice by the way and

1511
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:24,000
then Sony is offering six months of curiosity for ps3 owners basically you sign up for their

1512
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:33,680
little demo of the service and you can get a music unlimited option and then you can

1513
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:39,440
listen to whatever songs you want to pretty cool that's pretty cool as long as it doesn't

1514
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:45,280
roll into like a subscription or something like that well that yeah I would decide but

1515
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,280
I mean I know they were very careful about PlayStation Plus where they did go out of

1516
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,080
their way to say you once the 30-day trial is up in the welcome back program once the

1517
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,640
30-day trial is up you will not be charged at all I mean it's it's yeah I'm actually

1518
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:03,920
I'm trying to get it I have to download my games and stuff but right now we don't have

1519
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,000
remember my my ps3 doesn't have wireless internet keep in mind you only have till July something

1520
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,080
I know that it's July 3rd I'm probably gonna do this week but uh you know I've been have

1521
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:22,040
to drag an ethernet cable out to the front room is not very fun all right let's get to

1522
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:26,220
the Twitter topics I've actually before I get there I've actually been purposely waiting

1523
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:30,840
on the PlayStation Plus I'm waiting till right before the last day because if it is a 30-day

1524
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,840
trial either something's got to come out real soon that makes me want to get it like now

1525
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:40,360
to get the discount or whatever or I'm gonna wait and see you know cuz see if they maybe

1526
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,080
start putting on some real good stuff after it's not free anymore you know I mean for

1527
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,000
most people that went in and jumped in day one we'll see I don't know maybe it'll pay

1528
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,120
off maybe not let's move into some Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr every week you

1529
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:57,560
show us your tweets and we read them here on air why because we're the show where every

1530
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:02,680
gamer has a voice JV Mon sent us a string of tweets to start us off today that basically

1531
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:06,720
he went to Nintendo World and said there's a huge line for Zelda I didn't even realize

1532
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,320
they were showing that today but they were of course this is New York City he says it

1533
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,000
easily goes down at least a block and a half before they start letting people in and even

1534
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,020
send a little picture I guess these are people like going into the store cuz from this picture

1535
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:23,760
it doesn't look very long but the lines going like the other way but yeah looks like you're

1536
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:29,480
huge crowds out there today and he says the one time I forgot the 3ds at home like everyone

1537
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:35,680
has them you get a street pass like a hundred people over at that event crazy let's see

1538
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:41,440
also some other tweets Warrior Bob had tweeted I just realized I've been listening to olr

1539
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,880
for like seven years holy carb yeah some of our listeners have been listening a long time

1540
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,000
so thank you to all you of course the listeners we wouldn't be here for more finger support

1541
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,960
whether you just started listening this week or you've been there since episode one which

1542
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:57,880
would be very few of you because I think we had 12 people listening that week but thank

1543
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:02,400
you to you guys who supported us from whatever time over the years Defective Candy sent us

1544
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:11,360
a tweet with a story from CNN average age of a gamer goes up and CNN had reported here

1545
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:16,800
I guess they were reporting about this 37 year old that you know now that I'm gonna

1546
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,600
be 33 pretty soon 37 does not seem that old at all in a row so I'm just kind of surprised

1547
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:27,440
they're talking about this whole thing like gamers are getting older I think just a lot

1548
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,360
of us grew up on games and haven't stopped because we just accepted as a part of our

1549
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:38,280
lives whereas I think back when the original Nintendo came out maybe 37 year olds at the

1550
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,720
time didn't get it quote unquote so I don't know but anyway they were talking about this

1551
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:48,040
whole thing about how gamers are getting older blah blah blah blockbuster games the social

1552
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:53,360
games and so on and so on yeah gamers are getting older because I think they just haven't

1553
01:35:53,360 --> 01:36:00,320
left stuck with them dark Tetsuya says that he is plugging his first round of where are

1554
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,240
they now interviews I guess some of the people he's mentioned some of the people is going

1555
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:08,520
to be interviewing Jessica Harper is going to be in one of the where are they now interviews

1556
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:14,280
virtually who you might remember he was the guy that was famous for passing max 300 back

1557
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,800
in the day and rice used to be in our chat room all the time remember that kid all the

1558
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:24,060
time back when we were on life is five so dark Tetsuya has like dug out all these old

1559
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:27,680
school people from the past is going to be running features on the site so especially

1560
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:31,280
if you were into the money culture back in the day it sounds like he's found a lot of

1561
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,080
those people if you're not so much into the money culture then it's interviews with gamers

1562
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:38,200
but you'll be I think it'd be neat to see the roots of where we came from although if

1563
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:44,320
you can't tell where Jessica Harper is you know we know where she is yeah Jessica Harper

1564
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:49,000
of course is on Saturday nights on all games radio on her own show with Travis Donovan

1565
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,640
why are you guys listening that's right so yeah I could tell you where she is now but

1566
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:58,320
I'm sure there'll be some other little tidbits in there maybe she'll talk about how it was

1567
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,160
to have DDR freak in orange launch radio kind of coexisting because it was an interesting

1568
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,120
history we talked about it when she was here for the first time on the show if you didn't

1569
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:11,400
listen you'll just have to go find that episode all right anyhow type classes a few tweets

1570
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:16,600
one of them is about I don't think this comes up later in the show so I apologize if I'm

1571
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:22,320
stealing someone's story the tiger claw posted but I guess this had to do something um what

1572
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,160
was this electronic arts no we definitely don't have this on the list tonight electronic

1573
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:35,040
arts had a gun in the godfather games called the Dillinger and back in 2009 the grandson

1574
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:41,960
of Dillinger's half-sister threatened to sue EA unless they paid him millions of dollars

1575
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:47,160
wow that's kind of sad well a judge in Indiana this week said that the Dillinger descendant

1576
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:52,640
is not entitled to any money there is an Indiana law regarding a person's publicity right it

1577
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:58,320
was enacted after Dillinger died so sorry totally sounds like a cash grab thing against

1578
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:06,000
a big corporation and he got basically laughed out of court everybody point and laugh hahaha

1579
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,520
tiger claw links us one more story Miyamoto has said that virtual boy games on the 3ds

1580
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,920
it could happen I guess wherever there's money to be made right it was in an interview with

1581
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:22,800
game spot saying quote for Miyamoto well that's not my exact plan but something like that

1582
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,640
could happen I can say that in my photo album on my Nintendo 3ds there is a photo of a virtual

1583
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:35,320
boy so that says I do have a virtual boy at my disposal laughs only 14 games were ever

1584
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:41,440
released in the West virtual boy color yeah I think it would be interesting to see them

1585
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:46,480
visit some of those games they weren't terrible per se I mean they would be good what are

1586
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:51,560
they charging for those three bucks I think they'd be good three dollar games yeah you

1587
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,720
know like the Mario game nice to see them redone in color I think red I think it would

1588
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:59,720
be neat to see them redo that but we'll see and hopefully this time they won't give us

1589
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:05,960
migraines but we'll see that was the worst we'll see that does it for the twitter topics

1590
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:12,580
night twitter.com slash olr say hi to us throughout the week more news stories mailbag soon skype

1591
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:20,040
line after that we still have plenty more to cover so let's go to Loki ah yes so apparently

1592
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:25,480
you know the long talked about connect for windows software development kit has finally

1593
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:33,320
been released released the beta has and of course they have you know the versions available

1594
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:38,280
for 32-bit and 64-bit and requires windows 7 and I guess it's for non-commercial use

1595
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:46,440
so right now you can you know homebrew developers can make their own connect hacks or whatever

1596
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:53,040
and show them off and one way may be able to show them off is actually in this new vote

1597
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:59,880
for the next connect hack to become a connect fun labs toy they have voting up right now

1598
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:09,960
for a few different hacks six well-known ones I guess the apps in question keyboard anywhere

1599
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:15,800
it's basically like the keyboard from big you know or the floor keyboard where you can

1600
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:21,320
play just by stepping around the ground virtual conductor which would be kind of similar to

1601
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:28,760
like we music the conductor in that connect body art would basically take pictures of

1602
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:33,560
you as you're moving around and you can kind of layer yourself throughout there they have

1603
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:42,600
a really weird kind of hippie video for that hand puppets was shown off they had like a

1604
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,760
bird hand puppet has been projected onto the wall that someone is manipulating with their

1605
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:51,920
arm and when the camera saw you move your hand it would move the puppet as well so it's

1606
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:58,680
kind of cool digital pin art which is like those pin art devices where you can kind of

1607
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:03,560
make your hand imprint stuff like that they have that and then music visualizer which

1608
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:07,880
would be kind of just like it sounds something you play music to and it kind of makes these

1609
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:16,520
waveforms appear all throughout your room so those are all right now you can vote on

1610
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:24,120
those on connect share.com and have you played connect fun labs yet no it's so dopey like

1611
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:28,400
it is it's really one of those things is fun for five minutes and you're like oh okay but

1612
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:32,100
it's real yeah it's free can't complain free achievement points if you're into that sort

1613
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:37,760
of thing but I it's really the type of thing I think a bunch of people would get drunk

1614
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,600
and have a lot of fun making the little mini movies like you know the one I did at the

1615
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,720
Sailor Moon that was like you know I'll kill you and all that stuff but I don't know a

1616
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,880
lot of it's kind of okay I would be with a keyboard thing to come out though that look

1617
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:57,120
it needs to be longer than 15 seconds yeah they need to let you do more with that alright

1618
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:01,680
anyhow moving on to one of the other announcements out of E3 was that there is a Silent Hill

1619
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:08,400
collection coming not just a Metal Gear but a game that's dear to us the Silent Hill series

1620
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:13,440
is getting an HD collection but here's the catch it's only on PlayStation 3 it will only

1621
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:18,760
include Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 but there will be new high definition graphics

1622
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:24,600
so right now it's a PlayStation 3 exclusive according to the producer Tom Hewlett quote

1623
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:28,960
it's always been a primarily Sony platform series so right now we're just aiming at a

1624
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,600
Sony exclusive which isn't to say that in the future it won't be available anywhere

1625
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:38,380
else but right now it's a Sony exclusive they are looking at a fall 2011 release by the

1626
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:43,760
way there is all new voice acting in this game as well it is being directed by Mary

1627
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:50,080
Elizabeth McGlynn and so there's a new actor that's going to be in the series let's see

1628
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:58,400
and I think a lot of this is because the other actor James Sunderland doesn't have such kind

1629
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:02,400
things to say about his participation I'm sorry the guy who played James Sunderland

1630
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,600
guy see he quote Konami knows that they owe me residuals for all previous unauthorized

1631
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:13,420
reuses of my mocap and virtual performances it would appear Konami is seeking to avoid

1632
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:18,640
further liability by changing the voice of their latest reuse of the Silent Hill 2 materials

1633
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:23,560
however if any of my mocap appears in the new release Konami will be liable for unauthorized

1634
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:29,800
reuse of my performance yikes I'll get around to seeking compensation through the courts

1635
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,520
one of these days I simply don't have the time for it right now I hope this doesn't

1636
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,840
burn out any fans it's just business as usual on the production side of games yikes so it

1637
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:43,760
sounds like we might have the real reason why all new voice acting is coming to the

1638
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:50,600
game anyhow one other thing I want to put out you know there is the Silent Hill downpour

1639
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:55,040
game coming out soon which I don't know I think the shark might have been jumped on

1640
01:43:55,040 --> 01:44:01,240
Silent Hill we might be kind of be done with it and if we weren't if this wasn't the nail

1641
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:07,600
in the coffin the game's soundtrack of course no longer by Akira Moka it's by Dan Licht

1642
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:17,440
who did the music for Dexter the theme song is being written by Korn the metal band yes

1643
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:23,320
that's right Korn is doing the theme song to the game hey remember the 90s you guys

1644
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:27,520
weren't they awesome you know though I have to listen to the actual song first because

1645
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,840
you know just because it's done by Korn doesn't mean it's going to be terrible there's a very

1646
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,840
good likelihood that it's going to be terrible but you know there's some artists out there

1647
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:42,040
that can do scores that aren't they aren't terrible but then again this is Korn so it's

1648
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,200
not scoring it they're just doing the theme song well it's also though if you want to

1649
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:49,580
look at versatility I mean Daft Punk did do the entire Tron Legacy soundtrack and it was

1650
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:53,400
quite different than their usual stuff true but when that was announced everybody said

1651
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:59,720
that's fucking awesome and that makes sense but Korn doing Silent Hills is kind of like

1652
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:06,200
do not want like the guy doing the guy that did Dexter the score for Dexter doing the

1653
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,560
score for this game I don't think it's gonna be that bad I think that would be yeah I think

1654
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:14,280
that'd be all right I mean the reality is Akira Moka is moved on he's doing something

1655
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:20,240
else now you're not gonna have that yeah so he's doing something else that's for sure

1656
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:26,320
and speaking of Neon Genesis even the music game yeah yeah I heard about that that's not

1657
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:33,600
as big project though no no no it's just weird yeah so we'll see what happens with the Korn

1658
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:38,760
theme song hey some of you still some of you still love your Korn so maybe it'll be a great

1659
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,400
thing I just don't when I think of Silent Hill and what bands would go good with that

1660
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,000
I don't think a Korn I don't know pendulum Alan Wake had a pretty badass soundtrack actually

1661
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,480
but they used a lot of old songs there was a Poe song on there Poe hasn't put out an

1662
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:58,200
album since 98 I love Poe dude whatever songs like it just I was playing Alan Wake and like

1663
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:02,520
chapter 2 or chapter 3 closes with a Poe song like it came out of nowhere I was like which

1664
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:07,620
one it's fucking Poe haunted oh I know it's like a great song I was like oh my god this

1665
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:12,560
game has Poe this is great here's something random Alan Wake has probably been in development

1666
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,680
since 98 but yeah here's something random is that almost every CD that I've burned except

1667
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:22,860
for my very last one has trigger happy jack on it can't talk to a psycho like a normal

1668
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:29,000
human being yeah that's a great fucking love Poe however she needs to just put out a new

1669
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,600
album get over all this I was abused by my record label show me on the doll where the

1670
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:38,720
record label touched you I mean just I'm kind of over all that anyway Loki we'll save that

1671
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:43,760
for a different podcast that's hilarious well how how about some Nintendo news how about

1672
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:50,900
some Nintendo news well Mario Kart 3d is supposedly gonna have eight player local wireless racing

1673
01:46:50,900 --> 01:47:00,780
if it goes to plan and eight player online as well so basically Hideki Kono said that

1674
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:06,480
it would have online play and they just weren't sure what exactly the configuration was but

1675
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:13,840
that the goal is that you could have eight players both in local wireless and over Wi-Fi

1676
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,760
so they also said that should be able to handle 60 frames per second with eight players in

1677
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:26,280
both online offline 2d and 3d it's pretty cool and then in addition to that is red flare

1678
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:35,760
3ds Japan is gonna be getting a bright red one with a looks like it's black on the inside

1679
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:47,640
top cover and they actually put out some press about that around the e3 time and that it

1680
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:54,200
looks like it's gonna they're also with new we bundles there's gonna be on June 23rd we

1681
01:47:54,200 --> 01:48:03,480
sports resort and a we remote plus in the same color as console it should be about 250

1682
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:11,280
bucks or 20,000 yen the red DS looks red 3ds excuse me looks kind of cool I gotta say it's

1683
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,540
a pretty awesome color if they'd had that at launch I would have got that color think

1684
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:21,300
of an old Famicom yep although it is weird to me how the top screen doesn't change colors

1685
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:26,040
I mean I guess it's part of the whole 3d effect thing I think I read somewhere that they can't

1686
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:32,520
change colors because it would harm the 3d effect but whatever what I can see that because

1687
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:38,560
your frame colors are gonna affect your perception that's why I like for some reason like displaying

1688
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:44,340
most art is good on a room with a light pink wall okay well I understand that you can't

1689
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:48,840
change the frame around the actual you know system but I mean they can change at least

1690
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:53,280
the outside could all be one cuz I seem to remember the lid is still I don't know I haven't

1691
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:58,400
it's mine is black so it doesn't really matter it is they do have like three different colors

1692
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:03,480
on there three different shades of a color and so I they can do it but yeah yeah I don't

1693
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,880
know the black around the outsides I put a link to the image in the chat room all right

1694
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,280
all right well let's move on with some more news yeah it's not it's not too terrible but

1695
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:18,640
anyways um so other fun stuff here I'm gonna talk a little bit about Nintendo and the Wii

1696
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:24,680
U again and of course one things that people are asking because it's somewhat popular to

1697
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:30,920
have some free to play games on different platforms Nintendo is not interested in freemium

1698
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:38,940
games and saying that it hurts the value of games it says that's because I myself am one

1699
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:43,160
of the game developers who in the future wants to make efforts so that the value of software

1700
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:48,260
would be appreciated by the consumers it says although freemium games can make money through

1701
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:54,020
ads and microtransactions they expressing concern about destroying the value of the

1702
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:59,200
game software once again I think it's all because they want to sell virtual console

1703
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:06,480
games for $5 versus 99 cents that you can get for a great game on some other platforms

1704
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:11,460
like Android and the iOS and stuff like that not to say that all 99 cent games that come

1705
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:14,680
out on those are very good speaking of which I just want to throw out there there's a big

1706
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:20,800
sale going on this weekend on for for games for 99 cents on iOS and it's the company game

1707
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:26,480
loft which you know they're a little because they they kind of rip off games but they they

1708
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,720
do a pretty decent job from what I understand of ripping off games so I just bought two

1709
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,360
of them because all the games are 99 cents right now I bought order in chaos which is

1710
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:39,520
their Wow clone on the phone and I hear it's it's definitely not Wow but for an iPhone

1711
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,320
it is kind of impressive and then eternal legacy which try to guess what it's a clone

1712
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,600
of just from the little icon I already know it's literally I'll show it to dark soccer

1713
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,880
in the bottom right hand corner there on my phone I just I just downloaded it while I'm

1714
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:56,680
here would who does that look like to you yeah who did tell listeners who's that look

1715
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:03,700
like very cloud yeah it's it's a Final Fantasy 7 rip off but they're 99 cents so I and I

1716
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:07,880
hear they're good rip off so we'll see I'll tell you about those next week but anyway

1717
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:13,280
sorry to deviate from the story so what's that mean exactly cuz Ghost Recon online is

1718
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:19,800
a free play to game on a PC and it's gonna be on the Wii U well expect it not to be free

1719
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:26,560
to play so that's kind of unfortunate also it's very long you know it's very far away

1720
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:33,600
so maybe they'll change their mind but I don't know it's just Nintendo be Nintendo whatever

1721
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:42,080
and of course you know people were hoping that you know because the Zelda 25th anniversary

1722
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:46,640
is happening right now that maybe Nintendo's gonna do something cool like they did with

1723
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:50,960
you know well I wouldn't exactly call it cool because all they did was port a fucking Super

1724
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,200
Nintendo game to the Wii but they're hoping that there would be some sort of Legend of

1725
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:58,440
Zelda anthology or something like that that would come out with you know all the Zelda

1726
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:06,720
games you know on a disc or something and of course they said no they're not gonna do

1727
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:13,640
that because they don't want to do the same thing two years in a row that was their excuse

1728
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:21,040
they don't want to do the same thing two years in a row ah Nintendo you just make it too

1729
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:24,480
damn easy you don't want to do the same thing two years around like re-release all these

1730
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:33,560
old-ass games and you know mark them as new or I don't know it wasn't like Mario Galaxy

1731
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:40,160
Mario Galaxy to release not too far apart I mean you know that's within two years about

1732
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:44,760
new Super Mario Brothers we and New Super Mario Brothers me yeah they don't want to

1733
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:48,300
do they're getting these not a game no no here's what they want to do they want to release

1734
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:53,080
all that shit on a virtual console or you know for the 3ds or something charge you you

1735
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:56,960
know separately for everything in my opinion they kind of already did it back on the Game

1736
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:04,520
Cube too yeah they did it on the Game Cube as a pre-order bonus come on if that was awesome

1737
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:08,980
see that's how you treat your customers by offering them something really fucking awesome

1738
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:15,280
for ordering Wind Waker which I still think is a pretty awesome game but they just don't

1739
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:20,720
want to do that they don't want to do it so whatever and you know what they're gonna do

1740
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:27,400
I will bet you money you see cuz that that wonderful Wii U doesn't play Game Cube games

1741
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:33,680
so that means it's time to do some more of those so was it virtual console Game Boy Game

1742
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:39,920
Cube games it's no more the new play motion games remember how they had that for a while

1743
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:44,840
where they're gonna take old-ass Game Cube games yeah like Peekman straight port them

1744
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:50,560
over with Wii controls mm-hmm yeah that's what they're gonna do good times hey as long

1745
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,520
as f-zero is one of those games because I'm kind of pissed that I didn't hear about a

1746
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:02,720
new f-zero but I guess it was just dreaming anyway all right moving on to another story

1747
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:07,340
isn't f-zero 64 right yeah but that's already on virtual console that's been all you know

1748
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:13,920
what they're gonna do their import that shit the 3ds oh my god moving on this was a kind

1749
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,060
of interesting story from the weekend it's about Duke Nukem Forever and it has to do

1750
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:21,880
with those negative reviews and so forth I don't know if you heard about what happened

1751
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:28,560
but on Twitter this gentleman named James Redner he is the founder of the Redner group

1752
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:34,920
who was representing 2k games and was representing some of the games like Duke Nukem Forever

1753
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:40,640
and so forth he actually put a tweet out that said too many went far with their reviews

1754
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:45,380
we are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's venom he

1755
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:50,960
followed it with bad scores are fine venom-filled reviews that's completely different he did

1756
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,760
follow up his I don't know he was probably high or drunk when he did it he deleted the

1757
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:59,260
tweets and then apologized saying that he was just acting under emotions he was just

1758
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,960
being very emotional and his panties were very bunched and he wrote those tweets in

1759
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:08,800
anger but 2k games sacked him they said 2k games does not endorse the comments made by

1760
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:13,680
Jim Redner and we can confirm that the render group no longer report represents our products

1761
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:18,960
that was a very public bitch-slapping of that but you know this is one of those things that's

1762
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,960
not a very big secret that seems to go on in the industry and it's this very interesting

1763
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:28,100
game of chicken that goes on between the big media sites and these you know people that

1764
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:33,080
represent the publishers is the publishers will send games out early but there's always

1765
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:37,540
kind of that expectation of well are you gonna print a good review and we've heard these

1766
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:42,000
stories about embargoes that are allowed to be lifted only if you give the game a good

1767
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:48,400
review and you know you can get a sneak peek at this game if you gave such and such game

1768
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,880
a good review I mean it's shady shit that happens and that's why we tell you you know

1769
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:58,720
a lot of times the the reviews that you trust most come from the indie sites that are buying

1770
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:03,680
these games themselves and not going through these PR agencies I'm not I'm not knocking

1771
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:08,160
all PR agencies because some of them do really great things and they do really help out and

1772
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:13,280
get questions answered and so forth but unfortunately there's a lot of shady shit that happens out

1773
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:18,940
there and if you don't think this happens on a big website that you like to read a lot

1774
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:24,400
between that website and the agency you're you're really lying to yourself you know this

1775
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:29,880
this is just a part of the industry I remember very vividly we went to a particular company's

1776
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:36,000
thing and had to sign things saying we would not report on anything until I think it was

1777
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,640
like the Monday after or something like that sure enough the Sunday night before all the

1778
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:48,000
big websites got to leak some stories it was kind of shady so each got one so what you

1779
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,760
do in that kind of case is you just start you know you quote them as the source I know

1780
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:56,200
it's you just quote them as the source but then it's like you know you're sending people

1781
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:01,000
back to the big websites and not anybody's supposed to start necessarily like for example

1782
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,880
there was a story I read this week that went back about three different websites and people

1783
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,680
kept quoting the one that was quoting the other one that was quoting the other one so

1784
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:14,980
you know you can do that all right let's get to the mailbag every week at orange launch

1785
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:20,360
radio we welcome your emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com we're going to dive into

1786
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:25,920
the email bag head first and read your emails dark soccer wants to set it out tonight because

1787
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,100
she's going to be nursing her throat with some tea so she doesn't cough and die on air

1788
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:32,120
so I'm going to read some emails tonight and we're going to start with a couple here from

1789
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:37,000
holly d holly d and chat says are you guys going to make an orange lounge guild for rift

1790
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:43,400
like you did with wow if so let us know the shard nothing official from my standpoint

1791
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:47,400
I actually let my rift subscription lapse sorry it's just I didn't want to pay for multiple

1792
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:52,320
games at once so I might go back to it later like if there's a really cool expansion or

1793
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:59,960
something but I let it lapse so I don't know if there's enough rift people out there then

1794
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:04,560
by all means we should start something but I don't know if we have a lot of olr listeners

1795
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,400
playing rift we'll have to see ask on the forums that'd be a good place to check that

1796
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:15,500
out orange launch radio.com holly sends us another email about sony and more hacks going

1797
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:20,960
on so apparently being hacked once writes holly and taking the network down then again

1798
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:25,600
then on a different website compromising millions of accounts it has happened again this time

1799
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:31,520
it was not customer information but the entirety of the source code for the psn network how

1800
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:36,280
sony never fixed the original vulnerability everyone waited for four weeks for psn to

1801
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:41,080
come back for nothing that's not good that that leaked I'm not just sure if this level

1802
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:45,800
of idiocy can be covered by the phrase monumental stupidity but I'm sure it's a start and we

1803
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:51,520
get linked to a website uh she links us to a story from jupiter broadcasting.com which

1804
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:59,760
I don't think I've ever heard of yeah let's see a hacker group got into hacking sony on

1805
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:05,120
june 6th and they leaked the source court code to the sony psn developers network and

1806
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:09,440
that could allow people to find more flaws with the sony system very quickly it could

1807
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:14,560
also open up a private psn network they got all the source code and of course this was

1808
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,760
all happening you know after sony was supposed to be fixed they were they used the hacker

1809
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:24,320
group used a sql injection attack against sony pictures they got 150 000 records from

1810
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:34,860
the database of more than 4.5 million records wow hackers gonna hack not that that makes

1811
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:39,720
it right but uh again change of passwords use them um use different passwords on different

1812
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:48,840
websites uh going to an email now from who's this from janai dear olr i found a horror

1813
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:54,400
point-and-click game on the xbox live indie game section called decay i can describe it

1814
01:59:54,400 --> 02:00:01,200
as deja vu meets silent hill in an atmospheric way there are three episodes costing 240 microsoft

1815
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:05,360
points each i think it is a highly polished game for an indie developer i would like to

1816
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:08,760
hear your comments on this game and then he links us to the official site well i haven't

1817

1818
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:20,080
gate dot se please note that is not a dot com it's dot se and uh yeah there's this whole

1819
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:24,680
little trailer on the website for the game that is auto playing boo hiss i hate that

1820
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:27,640

02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:40,320
on uh yeah it looks like there's part two part three part four is the final part that's

1823

1826
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:05,880
that uses the right kind of codec that works on windows movie maker it says that it's an

1827
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:10,340
unregistered file hey loki you're good with movies right you should listen to this i make

1828
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:13,600
movies using i'm sorry i make music videos using cutscenes for video games i'm having

1829
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,160
trouble finding a download site that has the right kind of codec that works on windows

1830
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:21,740
movie maker so if you three or the chat could help in directing me to that area i would

1831
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:27,000
be grateful i'm looking for bayonetta cutscenes preferably how do you get cutscenes that you

1832
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,640
can use in windows movie maker um i don't remember what exactly windows movie maker

1833
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:36,700
uses i'm sure it's just windows media stuff i mean it's all about having the correct codex

1834
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:42,360
on your system um on your pc so just download some of the community codec packs and stuff

1835
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:47,680
like that and hopefully that'll work you can even dump youtubes to movie files right can't

1836
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:52,520
you uh it's not the best quality you can if you have the right real player i use real

1837
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:58,000
player to download them offline whoa real player still exists yeah actually a real player

1838
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:05,240
has a download thing that'll convert it to mp4 or anything damn real players i used to

1839
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:10,160
use to watch episodes of downloaded south park in like 98 or just like you know looking

1840
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:14,140
for like some sort of universal file converters and stuff like that see if you can find anything

1841
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:20,000
that it's meant for that because uh i've really i honestly don't use movie maker i use adobe

1842
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,120
premiere so that usually doesn't have a problem opening anything here's some comments from

1843
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:27,920
our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com scott pilgrim says there's your problem you

1844
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:33,680
use windows movie maker but download the k-lite codec pack that should help uh frisbee says

1845
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:41,280
get a linux distro and use kden live uh and sha100mat even uh backs it up saying download

1846
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:46,680
something other than windows movie maker frisbee says or open shot uh it might that might be

1847
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,480
tough because windows movie maker might be the program you're comfortable with but there

1848
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:53,800
are other alternatives out there um basically the same i mean there's a little bit of a

1849
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:57,160
learning curve but like for example premiere like when i first started using like what

1850
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:00,720
the hell am i doing and then now i i kind of am a little bit more comfortable with it

1851
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:06,120
now that i've used it for a while movie maker i tried using one time and i don't know it

1852
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:11,320
it's a little too basic um we use adobe audition actually to produce the podcast and uh at

1853
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,800
first it can look really overwhelming because there's all these features that you know for

1854
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:20,280
a podcast you don't really need but all the you know sound uh the opening that you hear

1855
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:25,200
was was kind of mixed together and audition you know so adobe products are pretty good

1856
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:29,540
anyhow let's go on to the rest of the email here from jose osumu regala also i would like

1857
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:35,040
to chime in with the new gimmicky systems announced at e3 both have really lame names

1858
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:40,960
who who in their right minds came up with vita and weu shame on you sony nintendo we

1859
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:46,120
saw this coming well thanks for reading my humble little you know vita i'm not too it's

1860
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:52,400
a weird name but they also have the sony vio and you know that works i like the psv that

1861
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:56,720
comes out of that i think that's might have been something they were going for but i only

1862
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:02,060
had to do was like place psp2 why why is it it got to be something fancy like the vita

1863
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,860
see i think that with that whole back thing they could have called it the the playstation

1864
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:13,880
touch and then it could be the past think about it it'd be clever looking for group

1865
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:18,720
buried and hold pst or the uh the p the playstation to reach around because you can reach around

1866
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:26,280
the back that would have been awesome on the back uh weu is definitely one that's getting

1867
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:30,320
a lot of like you know a lot of people have made the joke about i thought it was a university

1868
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:35,680
for mario you know things like that but uh you know you gotta go well everybody everybody

1869
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:45,920
made fun of we when it first came out so again let's see the games to back up the name although

1870
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:51,560
it was a weird that weu does not give that control like i don't think of that controller

1871
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:56,320
when i hear weu like i get what they were trying to go for is that well it wasn't really

1872
02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:01,600
about one person it was a part basically saying the we is a big party game system and we wanted

1873
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:04,640
to make a system that wouldn't just be about party games that's that's kind of what i took

1874
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:13,720
away from what reggie was saying but uh weu weird yeah weird weird all right uh moving

1875
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:21,640
on with some other emails speaking of weu we have an email from rob who likes to email

1876
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:25,980
us a lot and we like reading his emails i let the weu and subsequent chatter in the

1877
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:30,680
back of my brain for a while and here's a few things that fell out number one weu like

1878
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:35,680
michael patcher said is the dumbest name ever of course it is the most memorable memorable

1879
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:41,480
name ever too it won't hurt the sales two weu is in danger by revealing its hand too

1880
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:47,160
soon the ps vita could do the same thing for the ps3 if they want to steal the idea i'm

1881
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:51,980
with you there rob above because the psp remember in 2006 they were showing the ridge racer

1882
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:57,440
with rear view mirror uh also if the ipad had a working controller pad doc similar to

1883
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:02,320
the weu tablet it could instantly steal the idea and look you can play your games anywhere

1884
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:06,560
you want instead of being stuck at home the ipad 2 can already do that didn't i see a

1885
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,200
story this week about some racing game that was being played through the apple tv unit

1886
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:14,280
well they had that for a while where they're doing that and you could basically it was

1887
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:20,280
real racing to hd and you can do that through the hdmi and uh use the tablet as like a map

1888
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:23,760
and stuff so you can do that already and i mean that may be a way that they're going

1889
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,660
to combat this stuff especially especially if they decide hey later on that we're going

1890
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:34,320
to go ahead and you know put out apple tv that plays games then they're going to have

1891
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:39,620
you know you're going to control stuff with your ipod or whatever and ipad and you may

1892
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:44,880
have that similar type of stuff so i don't know and one more thing michael patcher thought

1893
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:50,080
vita was the second worst name for a system i disagree since vita has meaning in and of

1894
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:54,920
itself i need to give sony credit for it in fact his analysis of nintendo and sony indicate

1895
02:06:54,920 --> 02:07:00,520
a bias towards sony not backed up by history look ma i'm a video game analyst ra baba ps

1896
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:04,160
i really hope the vita doesn't get the name of vita max i hope they start calling it vita

1897
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:08,920
vita magic bedroom that's just me uh well i mean this patcher guy you could look at

1898
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:12,940
him the same way we talked about reviewers earlier in the show i bet a lot of you guys

1899
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:16,480
listen to us every week because you know we're the show where every gamer has a voice but

1900
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:19,800
we're the three that you hear every week and you probably keep listening to us because

1901
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:24,840
you kind of like what we have to say you know in our analysis i mean we we joke about it

1902
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:29,400
on the show sometimes that we're also video game analyst or as i say video game analysts

1903
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:33,320
but uh it's it's sort of true i think you guys tuned into the show because you like

1904
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:38,560
our perspective on things and you know i don't know this guy i don't know this michael patcher

1905
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:42,960
guy so i'm not trying to say this disrespectfully but what the fuck makes him so goddamn special

1906
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:47,600
like you know i see his name everywhere and on these websites and stuff but he's just

1907
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:55,920
some asshole spouting off predictions just like me i guess he has a degree or something

1908
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:05,960
he works for uh web rush morgan i believe whatever you know what the guy does anyone

1909
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:10,280
like call him out for all the stuff that he's wrong on no no everyone forgets and every

1910
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:14,520
everyone reports about what he says it's just like when they were reporting about voldemort

1911
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:19,360
talking about you know this and that and stuff and everyone reports on it because that's

1912
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:23,480
what they do they're always saying something let's let's talk about it you know he he's

1913
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:27,600
saying this he must have some insider information no he doesn't he's a guy guessing on stuff

1914
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:31,220
i said he gets paid a lot more than he has a different background and again i'm not trying

1915
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:35,480
to sound disrespectful like i mean i realize this comes off completely rude but i mean

1916
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:44,120
my the reality is i care no more or no less about his opinion than i do rob of us opinion

1917
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:49,080
they're equal to me they're both gamers you know what i mean and actually i like rob about

1918
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:52,880
just a slightly more he actually listens to this show michael hatcher is not a gamer he

1919
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:58,800
he doesn't know shit about games rob is great uh going to our chat room and chat dot orange

1920
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:03,000
on twitter.com oh here comes ego boost you ready break man says we listen to you every

1921
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,320
week because one week we expect dark soccer to announce her plans for world domination

1922
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:13,800
and she needs followers right dude that was in like episode four besides that why would

1923
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:18,360
i announce my plans for world domination her plan for world domination is give me a dollar

1924
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:25,120
or a taco no why would i announce it because when it's going to be uh mysterious and who

1925
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:29,320
knows i might have already taken over the world it's just that i don't want the response

1926
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:35,080
we are this we already are the official video game podcast of the galaxy we are we we talked

1927
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:38,720
about this a long time ago is that we've declared that we are the official video game podcast

1928
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:44,240
of the galaxy and that's that dibs patent pending but actually i do have to say that

1929
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:50,760
you know dominating the entire world think about all of the paperwork and all of the

1930
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:56,560
stuff you'd have to manage i just like i'll let the world fuck itself up oh yeah we did

1931
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:04,960
give bobby pluto we did give that bobby can have all of the dwarf planets series pluto

1932
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:11,600
and it's oddly shaped moons all right moving on one other email last email tonight from

1933
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:17,620
spazzinator who your space bar is broken or something like you have words running together

1934
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:22,360
here you type like i was just typed on a psp i don't know but anyway i'm gonna do my best

1935
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:27,600
to get through this email hey olr instead of the usual topics that i typically bring

1936
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:31,520
up via email and twitter topics i thought i'd give my impressions of a recent downloadable

1937
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:37,000
game release magic the gathering duels of the planeswalkers 2012 aka magic 2012 i forgot

1938
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,120
that came out this week but it's only 2011 all right so fine magic 2012 is coming out

1939
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,880
now these are the i i really like these kind of emails i want to hear reviews especially

1940
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:49,280
on games i haven't played but i have a slight interest in i like the last magic game so

1941
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:54,760
let's see for those out there that are unfamiliar with the magic games this is the second in

1942
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:59,120
the series which is the video game adaptation of magic the gathering card game those who

1943
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:02,800
have played the card game at one point or another will have practically no problem picking

1944
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:07,000
up this game while newbies might have a marginally more difficult time with it due to the learning

1945
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,360
curve but even then it's not too bad all in all it's a faithful recreation of the game

1946
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:14,840
those who have picked up the original game last year really should pick up this one as

1947
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:19,560
well there are no noticeable bugs at least on the psn version and from what i can tell

1948
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:23,660
the devs have taken user input to heart and implemented much needed improvements while

1949
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:27,740
it's not perfect it's a drastic improvement over the first assuming that you haven't picked

1950
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:33,420
up the original game yet you want to pick up a cheap game i suggest passing passing

1951
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:38,440
up i'm sorry i suggest passing over the original game and just going for magic 2012 frankly

1952
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:42,560
i find this to be pretty damn fun in a major time scene rivaling the elder scrolls and

1953
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:46,400
fallout series in terms of amount of time that will inevitably be spent in this game

1954
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,780
while the single player stuff is fun and will be played a lot initially for the purposes

1955
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:53,700
of unlocking stuff the real meat and potatoes of the game is the multiplayer which frankly

1956
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:58,060
is a blast additionally if you're a trophy or achievement whore the 20 achievements or

1957
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:02,180
trophies in the game are easy as hell to get even by my standards even my grandmother can

1958
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:08,280
get them easily and she's been dead for 14 years wow that was morbid all in all i can't

1959
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:12,760
recommend this game enough it is available for both xbox live arcade for 800 microsoft

1960
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:18,680
points and on psn at its regular price for non ps plus members for 999 however due to

1961
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:22,840
most people having a minimum of one month's worth of ps plus you can get the game at a

1962
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:28,600
discount 799 so i give the psn version an ever so slight edge if only for that reason

1963
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:32,920
dude and you're totally a sony fanboy don't even try tonight no but it's pricing is a

1964
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:36,600
good point uh thanks for reading this email and sorry to dark sakura for sending this

1965
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:40,760
wall of text i just wanted to be thorough with my review you should be so thankful she's

1966
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:46,360
not reading emails this week because the whole space thing she would have screamed use your

1967
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:54,080
space space space i'm the best of space space we were doing that on space mountain he was

1968
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:59,160
he liked magic so much that the space bar got stuck we were doing that on space mountain

1969
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:06,160
remember i do i remember that i'm the best of space so much space gotta see it all and

1970
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:12,220
then we did it on star tours yes which by the way is an awesome ride is it a lot better

1971
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:17,840
now that they've fixed it uh you know the old one was charming but it is definitely

1972
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:23,320
modern now it's a lot smoother and it's just what i love about the ride is it just starts

1973
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:27,280
right off with a bang like you know and you are on your way to whatever planet you go

1974
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:34,420
to for the record we looked at how many different scenes and um at least with me and dan we've

1975
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:38,960
got all the beginnings there were two different beginnings right we've got all but one of

1976
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:42,960
the second one we didn't get hoth and i've been to hoth so it's cool it's the it's the

1977
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:48,560
best one we got all three of the middle scenes the the third ones which is either yoda akbar

1978
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:54,000
or leia it's a trap i know we're going to strip and then we got all but the last um

1979
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,080
all but coruscant course for the last one naboos i i would say the riding the ride several

1980
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:03,920
i've gotten i've seen all the last planets and i've seen all the i've seen every planet

1981
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:08,740
now and i will tell you the best ones are hoth for the first and uh nabu believe it

1982
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:12,080
or not the jar jar binks planet is the best because it has the best ending oh it was great

1983
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:15,400
well i did like the the um the death star one the death star one was pretty rad that's

1984
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:19,120
a close second of course con's not of of what we got though my favorite was kasheek because

1985
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:26,680
i like wookies anyhow we'll stop nerding about star tours now and get to the fus of the week

1986
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:30,040
it's the part of the show where we rant why because we can

1987
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:51,920
f you to being sick it's it's not like it's a contagious disease it's all my sinuses and

1988
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:58,000
it happens around this time of year i wanted to go swimming today as a result i laid down

1989
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:03,760
for what i intended to be an hour nap at 10 30 i woke up at 3 30 having slept through

1990
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:10,560
my alarm seven times apparently i kept resetting it in my sleep so yeah uh if you did the fact

1991
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:15,480
that i felt kind of like sickly lately like my my side was hurting and the doctor couldn't

1992
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:18,080
figure out what it is but at least it wasn't the same thing that put me in the hospital

1993
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:24,080
in 08 so whatever and i had this weird head thing like i bruised my head or something

1994
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:28,440
it fucking hurt like all week so if you did that and uh if you did the fact that my landlord

1995
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:33,760
says we owe them seven dollars like what where did that come from apparently it was something

1996
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:40,200
they just decided to throw on there a retro charge for something from april yeah what

1997

1999
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:58,360
i even did the thing to reset the uh graphics you know the quick little hold y and the right

for you guys and then the skype line 1877 game olr we'll get to that in just a moment

2008
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:53,160
uh moving on though first couple more stories loki and of course you know one story that's

2009
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:58,320
been around ever since duke nukem forever was being announced that's coming out and

2010
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:04,440
so on and so forth there was a guy with a really old gamestop pre-order for duke nukem

2011
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:13,280
forever from back in 2001 and apparently the guy actually did get to redeem his pre-order

2012
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:20,480
for duke nukem forever and um along with that uh gearbox even sent him a bunch of cool swag

2013
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:26,280
and uh stuff like that so uh apparently he does like the game the guy that picked up

2014
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:35,120
the game so good for him glad that they you know took your receipt that you kept all this

2015
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:40,780
time all right one more new story for you guys and then we're going to open up that

2016
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:47,320
skype line 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and unfortunately

2017
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:52,280
and on a bit of a sad note tonight it's another game studio who apparently has closed their

2018
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:58,900
doors uh game republic is the studio apparently the website has disappeared it's no longer

2019
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:06,600
online the tokyo offices now vacated uh apparently the founder yoshiki okamoto huge amounts

2020
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:10,760
of debt and can't be tracked down so unfortunately it looks like they've closed some of the game

2021
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:16,120
that they made majin and the forsaken kingdom uh folklore was another game that they made

2022
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:21,440
and i believe they were the studio behind uh genji day of the blade if i'm not mistaking

2023
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:27,940
uh the studio that's right of course infamous for the giant enemy crabs and while a lot

2024
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:31,140
of people are pointing and laughing at that whole thing it's never any fun to report developers

2025
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:36,920
losing their jobs it's a shitty economy right now no matter where you live all right let's

2026
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:42,040
open up the skype line it's open now 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge

2027
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:47,640
radio uh while we wait for those calls to come in i'm gonna ask loki if he has any last

2028
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:54,720
minute stories um not really i mean there's not a whole lot else that we have the report

2029
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:58,960
on i was gonna talk really quick though about uh there are some indie games that they're

2030
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:07,080
showing off um and one of them uh was was it revolver 360 it's this game that's on the

2031
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:12,960
xbox indie games and um it's pretty awesome i mean it just kind of goes to show you that

2032
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:17,440
there's like hidden gems out there it's basically a kind of almost like a cave style shooter

2033
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:22,480
it's just uh bullet hell like crazy but what makes it unique is that you can rotate around

2034
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:29,980
in kind of this 3d um this like 3d sphere so you can rotate the environment around so

2035
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:34,560
like if for example you have a you know bullets coming at you in a big line you can actually

2036
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:40,160
rotate it so that they're um you know vertical to the screen so you can dodge past everything

2037
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:46,120
uh kind of think of it like looking at tempest but kind of you know on the side let me go

2038
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:49,800
to the phones we got a call coming in here hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

2039
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:54,120
what up guys zenacore from the okc how y'all doing hey zenacore how you doing buddy you

2040
02:19:54,120 --> 02:20:00,920
know just hanging out ducking the man you know good time so are we uh so uh what's what's

2041
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:07,240
on your mind i'm still pissed off about my yard's revenge purchase oh gosh i heard this

2042
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:14,340
game was not so great but what what what happened to you well it the idea behind the game was

2043
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:19,520
solid i mean it's just a cord yeah a old school corridor shooter like you know like lucky

2044
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,200
and wild or anything else like that from the arcade at least that's the way it felt to

2045
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:29,320
me when i was playing it but just certain rudimentary things that were going on slipped

2046
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:33,040
through the cracks just like if it really got rushed i think is what happened to it

2047
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:38,960
i hate that i hate that when games are so obviously rushed i mean the game is functional

2048
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:43,080
but it looks like i mean the coders didn't finish putting the polish on everything when

2049
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:46,800
you first started at least on the pc version what i'm playing it's not full screen you

2050
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:52,440
can see the windows border yeah so i mean most savvy user you hit alt enter it will

2051
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:56,680
go into windows mode but because of the age of my machine i can't put it in the direct

2052
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:02,680
x10 so i'm not sure if i'm looking at the right graphics uh and the game play is a bit

2053
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:06,840
rough it's just not polished i think it really got rushed which kind of disappoints me because

2054
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:10,200
i sort of like the new idea they're going with it how do you feel about all these like

2055
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:15,440
kind of uh reimagining i guess of classic games this is something atari has really done

2056
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,520
a lot of and is going to continue to do over the next year i mean i think they've got a

2057
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:24,460
centipede game coming out on 3ds uh warlords they've revisited i mean they're really trying

2058
02:21:24,460 --> 02:21:30,080
to bank on nostalgia redone i guess what do you think about that i bought into that initially

2059
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:34,520
when they're doing that with the uh the xbox live arcade i got a lot of those games but

2060
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:38,980
you know sadly all the multiplayer stuff hardly anybody plays them even when they first came

2061
02:21:38,980 --> 02:21:43,560
out plays a multiplayer which kind of disappointed me i was really looking forward to do like

2062
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:48,800
tron deadly disc multiplayer and it's not happening so that was kind of upsetting but

2063
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:53,680
as long as they add enough to the game to where if they're charging 10 bucks it feels

2064
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:58,080
justified to me then it's fine they got to really polish it up or like what they did

2065
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:03,160
with yards events they changed the whole dynamic and used it as a as inspiration for their

2066
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:07,260
game i'm cool with that but just make sure you finish it you know give me finished stuff

2067
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:10,880
that's all i want yeah it's kind of tough when you you know yards revenge was really

2068
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:15,480
easily one of the top three atari 2600 games they ever released and just to kind of like

2069
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:23,280
take a classic and just rush it oh that hurts it's not even that the game was badly designed

2070
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,680
it's like the interface it's like normally when you're doing typesetting or whatever

2071
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:31,520
you leave the text online or up on the screen long enough to where you can read it twice

2072
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:35,640
it's bare if you're a speed reader you might just catch everything and be able to understand

2073
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:41,920
what you're at it's it's that quick on screen even during during the game there's no speech

2074
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:45,640
everything is in a chat bubble over on the corner you're not looking there in a hall

2075
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:49,240
so you have no idea what the characters are saying to each other i'm barely i barely understood

2076
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:53,880
what was going on but that's thanks for me reading lots of uh fan subbed anime and stuff

2077
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:59,080
i'm used to looking at subtitles so i managed to catch everything uh what are the games

2078
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:03,560
you've been playing lately anything else you want to throw out there uh not really doing

2079
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:09,240
a lot of really anime watching and uh you know the overseas stuff the x-men stuff and

2080
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:13,720
uh the the green lantern release that just came out recently the animated version oh

2081
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:16,560
mainly keeping up with that speaking of green lantern did you hear the news today the new

2082
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:21,680
movie uh it made 53 million which to me sounds like a lot of money but apparently considering

2083
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:27,120
the budget and uh the marketing apparently they are calling that the very very low end

2084
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:33,640
of expectations that uh doesn't bode well for a sequel later on yeah i think they're

2085
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:38,640
initially predicting they'd get around 70 75 so i'm thinking that number is right around

2086
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:43,460
where thor was well it did it i funny enough the story i'd read referenced the thor opening

2087
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:48,820
and it did open below thor and when you consider that i i guess they said i which i found weird

2088
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:52,800
the green lantern was more well known than thor and that was that was again the the source

2089
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:57,100
that i read whatever but you could say that the actor in thor was an unknown whereas ryan

2090
02:23:57,100 --> 02:24:01,040
reynolds people know him so that was kind of an ouch yeah i think it's because everybody

2091
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:06,440
knew he'd be better as a rile rainer or excuse me i get my lantern scared is screwed up here

2092
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:10,520
but uh he's playing the wrong lantern in other words that we knew it so that's the problem

2093
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:15,000
more more proof that deadpool should have come out already because you know he'd be

2094
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,040
perfect for deadpool oh yeah we knew that yeah so that's given all right well we geeks

2095
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:23,520
know all right i'm gonna let you go see of course we can take more calls but thanks for

2096
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:28,080
the uh review on yours revenge uh no problem man take it easy take care one eight seven

2097
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:32,400
seven game olr a username on skype is orange on radio i like this tonight it's like we're

2098
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:36,040
getting reviews from everybody on games i haven't been able to touch this is pretty

2099
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:40,920
nice so uh let's see if we get another one one eight seven seven game olr or a username

2100
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:44,800
on skype is orange lounge radio let me ask you this dark sakura um while we're waiting

2101
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:48,520
for some calls and loki left the room for a minute you know we're talking about nostalgia

2102
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:54,120
on that last call in a game like yards revenge they've reimagined how do you you you really

2103
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:58,400
still kind of live in the nostalgia world a little bit like you really probably play

2104
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:02,720
more retro games than you do current games i mean that's that's not hidden by your gaming

2105
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:11,600
weeks and so forth how do you feel about a lot of these reimaginings i really um it's

2106
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:16,040
kind of weird for me because if they're done faithfully then i have no problem with it

2107
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:22,520
if they take the basic concept and evolve it i'm really excited by that but if it's

2108
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:31,120
just you know and my concept of butchering a game is pretty personal it's going to be

2109
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:36,160
different for everybody but if they just take it and completely ruin aspects of it that

2110
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:40,720
i thought were great then then no like if they took the guardian legend and filled it

2111
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:45,620
full of blood no no all right let's go to the phones because we got more calls coming

2112

ps3 slims hard drive oh did you hear that any tips on upgrading a ps3 slims hard drive

2115
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:09,120
just make sure you back up everything uh to something else first and then um it's pretty

2116
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:14,480
easy i mean you just pop it in there and then format it um you do have to make sure it's

2117
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:22,760
formatted fat32 i think though uh are there any online resources just search online there's

2118
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:29,960
like uh there's a a thing from hp that you can format anything fat32 like i did my external

2119
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:34,640
laptop you don't need that all you have to do is run it through dos yeah uh what do you

2120
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:39,560
expand in the hard drive in your ps3 for you trying to fit more porn no just like i feel

2121
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:44,760
like i'm running out of space on my 120 that came with it you know i have an 80 gig and

2122
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:48,520

2126
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:08,240
voodoo now for the streaming since i don't like downloading from the psn store because

2127
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:12,600
it takes a while why do you uh like voodoo as compared to hulu and netflix i don't usually

2128
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:18,080
hear that one but i'm curious it's more for like the new releases it's like walmart for

2129
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:23,880
new releases so sometimes they have like a sale for like 99 cents for like a more recent

2130
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:29,240
movie i can watch that netflix doesn't have right all right very cool and like the new

2131
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:33,920
releases you can just stream it instead of downloading it you know download takes like

2132
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:39,560
maybe two hours three hours or streaming you just it's there will i be able to watch this

2133
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:45,120
game of thrones that everybody's talking about on there i got a torn that that that that

2134
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:49,120
shows on sunday nights and so of course i've never seen it you know it's funny having done

2135
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:53,280
this show for nine years like any tv show that's on sunday nights i just i don't ever

2136
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:57,140
get to watch like it's pretty good though i can't be good yeah i hear that one's really

2137
02:27:57,140 --> 02:28:00,440
good and i can't tell you how many people over the years have said rob you would love

2138
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:04,820
desperate housewives because i like that campy type of stuff and i guess that shows very

2139
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:09,200
campy but never seen an episode sunday nights i'm like if it's on sunday nights i've never

2140
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:15,880
watched it and i have another thing another question too sure um do you have to like download

2141
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:20,000
the firmware update for the when you're upgrading the hard drive like i've read like articles

2142
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,280
on it that you have to uh loki left the room for a minute so i'm not sure because i haven't

2143
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:31,480
changed my loki firmware update do you have to do a firmware update when you change those

2144
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:41,760
drives um i think you may have to redo the one your current firmware update to uh change

2145
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:46,800
them over it says that you have to do it again and it's supposed to not work afterwards but

2146
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:52,880
i put it i went from my 20 to my 500 maybe i didn't go back to my 20 i thought about

2147
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:56,560
going back to my 20 but i never did can you use a usb drive with those this might be a

2148
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:02,120
dumb question but you can but you can't store games to it oh interesting do you do movies

2149
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:08,720
you put movies on there you can put like pictures music nice but you have to have certain directories

2150
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:13,080
and stuff all right all right well uh any other thoughts for tonight before i let you

2151
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:21,440
go um bye-bye socom why you say bye-bye socom didn't like the game i rented it and didn't

2152
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:26,620
like the controls that you can't change it oh i hate that customizability should be like

2153
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:32,280
one of the first easy things to think about out here so i'm i'm very uh i guess call of

2154
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:37,180
duty player where you get you gotta have the triggers to fire and sight iron sight see

2155
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:44,040
so and it's we're doing it on the rnl buttons instead of the triggers all right well we're

2156
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:47,000
gonna let you go and we get some more calls but thanks for your call and good luck with

2159
02:29:57,660 --> 02:30:04,980
we get any other calls we're out of last minute stories right so we'll just uh we'll see if

2160
02:30:04,980 --> 02:30:09,000
anybody calls oh there it is lighting up there's always that little delay between uh when we

2161
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,400
say something when it goes out over the air hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

2162
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:17,000
it's the one and only ronma of course i knew you i knew you'd get through eventually ever

2163
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,720
since you said in chat that i missed your twitter topic sorry about that it's okay i

2164
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:24,800
forgive you i wasn't reading chronologically this week because we got a few that i wanted

2165
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:31,420
to make sure i mentioned before today so that's why i screwed up but anyway fair enough what's

2166
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:39,880
on your mind duke nukem forever ah what about it it's a guilty pleasure game to me the game

2167
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:45,120
is so bad it's just good so it's like the showgirls of video games something along those

2168
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:52,560
lines yes what uh tell us about how this game is so bad it's good like give give an example

2169
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:55,480
of something in the game that happens where you're like oh my god this is terrible and

2170
02:30:55,480 --> 02:31:03,040
i love it for example um if you remember from the demo there are two twins in the game they're

2171
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:13,760
called the wholesome twins mary and kate so no secret what that's parodying huh yeah pretty

2172
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:19,360
much and they show a video clip of them doing a video to a song called full house oh it's

2173
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:25,680
terrible very terrible i heard something about they die horribly later on like spoilers omg

2174
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:30,120
but i i don't know i'm at the point where the aliens kidnap them and dukes all pissed

2175
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:35,220
the fuck off about it i i hear it's not a pretty ending like it actually has some people

2176
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:40,280
kind of saying that that's where that is exactly where the game crosses the line just so you

2177
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:46,560
know i won't ruin it for you but you don't kill the hot chicks you don't do that i hear

2178
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:52,660
the ending is like wow but we'll see uh so what do you think about these websites that

2179
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:58,840
are giving the game a zero i think the sites are giving the game a zero are coming from

2180
02:31:58,840 --> 02:32:05,940
people who did not grow up playing the original duke nukem 3d it sounds like these are people

2181
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:11,200
that are younger than me who don't know that ass from a hole in the wall also they're counting

2182
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:16,960
on the fact that gearbox is working on so they expected something big like borderlands

2183
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:21,540
as i said before all gearbox said that they were going to do was put the game out they

2184
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:27,900
never said what they're going to exactly and so the weight of 12 plus years is like okay

2185
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:32,480
let's see what you got it seems like they were just looking for a reason to just blast

2186
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:36,020
a game here comes dan the man wants to say something on this topic yeah it should be

2187
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:41,580
on just make sure oh god geez it makes everybody wonder why they weren't putting it out oh

2188
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:46,080
because it sucked nuts and they knew it they were like holy fucking god we can't fix it

2189
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:55,680
it's terrible and there you go that's what you all fucking get oh my god fucking even

2190
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:01,660
gearbox couldn't polish that turd and gearbox rules great duke nukem's over fucking finish

2191
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:05,500
the next brothers in arms or whatever the fuck you're doing and get to work on borderlands

2192
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:11,500
too but rama says rama's review of the game is that this game is so bad it's good i hope

2193
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:17,400
to find out when i'm done with the game i will ship it overnight to you so you can play

2194
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:22,860

2195
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:26,660

2196
02:33:26,660 --> 02:33:34,540
