Tonight, June 26, 2011.
Could the 360 see free-to-play games?
Xbox brings Kinect functionality to advertisements.
And can Silent Hill be scary without Pyramid Head?
Hello my friends out there on the internet once again and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice Orange Lounge Radio My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts as I have joined with them for the past nine freaking years Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura Who let you in my house?
That's right, I did How are you?
I'm recovering.
Recovering from... Did you go... Sinus infection.
Oh, I was going to say... Remember I had a sinus infection last week.
I was going to say it's Pride weekend, so maybe you were recovering from... I'm recovering from the gay.
All right.
Say hello as well to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
Hello.
Who is setting up something tech right now.
What are you doing over there?
You're like getting his Xbox.
He's hooking up the Bloom box.
Orlando Bloom autographed Xbox.
Why?
Because he could.
Yes.
For No Good Root.
What are you going to play on there?
Are you playing Child of Eden again?
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
He just wants to play.
Gal Gun.
He just wants to play games.
Gal Gun.
I don't want to play Gal Gun.
We have special guests joining us tonight.
Of course, as always, you guys in chat.
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com You join us live and we read your comments here.
It is a show where every gamer has a voice.
We will have the phone lines open later despite that little tease I gave on Bobby's show beforehand.
We will have the phone lines open later.
And of course, Twitter.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Email bag, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Did I get it all?
Someone didn't put it on the show roll.
Whatever.
It's not there?
No.
Oh, well we are doing the mailbag at some point.
Damn.
When is a mystery to everybody?
Anyhow, let's introduce the guests we have here in studio.
We have some blasts from the past here to celebrate nine years of OLR with us.
As mentioned on Bobby's show, when you have your 100th episode, your 200th episode, your five year episode, you kind of run out of like...
The ego stroking gets a little old, but we thought what better way to mark nine years of OLR than to invite somebody who's on a show that's even older.
So say hello to the one and only Jessica Harper is here tonight.
I thought you were going to say, you know, when you're talking about ego stroking, who better than Jessica Harper?
Is that another word for it?
Euphemism.
I'm doing just fine.
Welcome.
And of course, you know, some of the dinner people from back in the day of Maundy Days know you as Iguana Girl.
Yes.
The Queen Bee of DDR Freak for quite some time.
Exactly, yeah.
The Queen Bitch.
We got all the DDR Freak gossip a few months ago when you were on the show last, so I don't know how much of that we want to revisit.
We'll see how much wine we get in you.
Yeah, I know.
But I have to make sure I don't have too much.
But of course you're here tonight to help plug the Under Sedation Live 10-year anniversary show is coming up.
Yes, coming up on July 16th.
We will have 10 years.
And we'll be sealing Rob away for that night.
He'll have the fun of doing two shows in one week.
Because as you guys may or may not know, I was doing Understation Live back when it first started.
Back then, it was before OLR.
OLR was a spinoff of Understation Live in some ways.
In some ways, just like DDR Freak Radio, which again, another blast from the past right there, was a spinoff of Understation Live.
So we all kind of formed our own stations based off of that station.
We all hatched out of that egg, and somehow we all came out looking like Lady Gaga, our respective shows.
I came out looking more like Weird Al, but I don't know.
Complete with the CGI'd face.
Exactly.
Very odd.
All right.
Anyhow.
As long as you make sure I'm wearing an octopus and have, you know, a big, huge building on my head, I'm all good.
Are you going for the Ursula look with the octopus?
Exactly.
In the building.
You know, I have to have the large building.
Which, by the way, can I just, random tangent.
I was at Disneyland.
I had to go without Alan because, you know, it was just finances being what they were.
But there's two things that Alan loves.
He loves Hello Kitty and he loves Ursula.
And you know what I was able to find at Build-A-Bear?
Hello Kitty Ursula.
A Hello Kitty, and I put an Ursula costume on it.
There you go.
And it's the best thing ever.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
That was awesome.
All right.
We will talk video games.
Oh, and her name is Divine.
Yeah, her name is Divine.
Anyhow.
It's more appropriate.
We will talk video games in a moment, but I have to introduce another blast from the past.
And this is somebody who wasn't on Under Sedation Live, but he was on many, many, many early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, and then he disappeared.
But now he's back.
Say hello everybody to the one and only intern Drew is back tonight.
Hey, what's up?
You can't keep me away from this place for long and still having a little bit of wine right now and it's going to affect me far more than it will Jessica.
This is creeping me out because back when the 23rd Magus was on the show back in the day, you weren't old enough to drink.
I was 17.
Oh my god.
I'm so old.
And now I feel old.
I've been here for nine years.
You can shut up with all that right about now.
He was also our resident young Republican.
From the two females in the room, can we both say, shut up.
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.
And now I'm, this is reminding me of my first show because once again, it's actually, it's Loki that has the pizza this time and I'm the closest to the floor.
So yeah, feeling old and moldy right now.
This reminds me of the first show, too, because I had a migraine that day.
Breakman starts us off saying he left and comes back and is still an intern lol absolutely because as long as he's an intern we don't have to pay him SSJ100 Matt says oh god hide your soundboard tables that is one of the highlights I guess you could say of OLR history was the night the 23rd Magus I'm gonna call him that all night long because it's retro
Drew broke the show
E. Gads, The Table Hath Fallen
So this week on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, our website, Dark Tetsuya, who, bless his heart, he's like the only person that's actually writing content for the site right now.
And I'm thinking I need to make a New Year's resolution.
I'm saying New Year of OLR's resolution.
Actually write content for the website because we need to get more people visiting OrangeLaunchRadio.com and posting on our forums and stuff.
And I think a lot of that comes with content.
Dark Tetsuya
So, again, a lot of people didn't really follow the scene in those days, but it was kind of fun to read about what's happened to a lot of those people.
Of course, you can't mention Bomani Culture without Get It.
Stop it.
But one of the people that was interviewed was Jessica, and you can read her article up on there and see what she's been up to, or she'll just tell us about it tonight.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Just slowly morph into gambling machines for children that spit out tickets.
Yeah.
And nothing else.
Yeah.
And what did you feel walking into Roseville Golf Land and just kind of seeing it now?
I wanted to cry.
Did you?
I really did.
It was just pathetic.
You walk in, and previously, one of the only reasons why I would still even go there was because there was a 2DX machine for a period of time there.
It's gone.
Mm-hmm.
Um, the, there's still two DDR machines.
They're now in a back corner tucked away where people like to walk over the pads even more so than they did when they were prominently displayed towards the middle.
And keep in mind, Roseville Golf Land is also a water park.
So a lot of times during the summer, that will be wet feet walking over electronic machines.
Genius people out in Roseville.
Or playing on the machines with their wet feet and leaving all of their water behind.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
The only machines that are there, you have an Extreme machine.
I'm sorry, Max 2.
And Disney's Rave.
And that's it for DDR.
And Drum Mania, there's no drumsticks.
There's a stool that's attached.
There's a stool that's attached by a big, huge metal chain so that you can't move it.
And the Guitar Freaks controllers were upside down and on the floor when I looked at it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What?
I took a picture of it.
Hold on, let me find my picture of it because I took a picture.
It's a Tetris game that's a giant ball.
Each controller is a huge ball and the screen is like twice my height.
Yeah, and there's a button on each side of the ball, and to move things, you have to move the ball around with your hands.
It's awkward Tetris.
Awkward Tetris.
That's exactly, well, it really is awkward.
It's hard to play, too.
Awkward phallic Tetris.
No.
With about half the size of the normal amount of lines, or actually a third of the amount of lines that you would normally have.
And it's still kind of hard to get any at all, because it's like, oh, you want it here?
Well, we're going to move you one block over.
Because it does not center.
Yeah.
Some comments in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com.
Let's see.
SSJ100Matt says, Every Golf Land is like that, though.
Yeah, but every Golf Land is not in Roseville.
And Roseville is a special place because everyone there is privileged.
Keep in mind that all of these horrible things that are happening to the arcade are complete opposite as to what's happening to every other portion of the Golfland Sunsplash experience.
You have Sunsplash, which just keeps on growing, and they keep getting more rides, and now there's this giant...
I do appreciate the fact that they have more parking because it was annoying having to park in and out in order to make it to Sunsplash.
You had to hike in.
During summertime, yeah.
The rest of the year was no problem.
Here it is.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Also in our chat room, chat.orange.com, TheRobD says, Skee-Ball is also Bring Your Own Skee-Balls.
Actually, I did play around a Skee-Ball last time.
I was at Arviggle.
And you know how, like, a bunch of balls are supposed to come down like nine balls, but if the machine is short any... It'll only give, like, three balls, and then it'll keep refilling the same balls.
I had two.
Yeah.
So I had to literally wait after I would throw two balls for... Now, see, I did play Skee-Ball while I was there.
Okay.
The one on the very far left...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Orange Lounge Radio giving you the pro tips.
Exactly.
And the whole reason why I ended up resorting to the little kiddie gambling games is because I had this card that had something to the tune of about 100 credits on it.
Oh, that's right.
They went through the card system.
That's how long it's been since I've gone there.
I think I have tokens still.
Yeah, I think at one point in time I tossed a $20 bill on...
to get a card so that I could play 2DX.
And I played for like an hour that one day.
And went, oh, I'll just go ahead and save this card and bring it back for next time.
And this was the next time.
Speaking of which, Rob, do you remember I was going to Dave & Buster's like the first year we went to E3?
I'm still using that damn card!
Like, I don't go there ever.
You need to go for the two-for-one arcade night or whatever it's called.
Yes, 23 Magus.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Aw.
So, before we get into our gaming weeks, which is how we're usually supposed to start off the show, but, you know, it's a birthday show, just deal.
I want to talk, because we were talking about turf and how the Rosewood Golf needs to be our turf, but I got to tell you one of my favorite just memories of the past nine years when it comes to when arcades are actually fun.
And that would be, as ghetto fuck as it is, Scandia Family Fun Entertainment Center.
Because I'm just going to say it.
We own that fucking joint for a short period of time.
Oh yeah, we did.
That was our turf.
The whole reason is when you get friendly, when you befriend the game tech.
Yes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't even remember.
We did March Madness.
Okay, I want to see the other one.
Which is normally a Bay Area tournament.
I'm telling you, we monopolized the birthday party room with our room where we were deep frying Twinkies and selling them.
Why?
Because we could.
I don't know, because it sounded funny.
because Justin B thought it would be a good idea.
What the hell ever happened to that kid?
I don't know.
He does music.
I think he remixes music now.
He's remixing stuff still.
We need to get him to do a thing.
One of his songs won Cage Match once.
And don't forget that for Shaft, the pad broke.
I do remember that.
And I had to run back home and go get my hard-mounted soft pads.
If that tells you how old school this is, kids.
There was no such thing as a Colabot Flex back then.
Hard, yeah, it was my custom hard-mounted soft pads that we ended up using for one of the routines for the competition.
Good times.
I beat my first nine-footer on those pads.
Me too, actually.
I think my second was on those pads.
I beat my first nine-footer.
But, um, yeah, I mean, and then I remember there was the little gazebo that was out there before you could go out to the golf course and just, it was all the, you know, Bay Area DDR people just took over that place and, like, families were trying to come in there and stuff and we'd get scared off by the conversation that was going on.
I mean, it's just, we re-
We ruled the school there.
Just start pulling out with random tunic tunic tunes.
Yes.
Except for the batting cages.
Those we didn't touch.
And then you remember all the bad things that happened to that place.
The time that they took it to the best of Sacramento or something like that and the speakers fell off or the marquee fell off of the thing.
And they put boombox speakers up there or something like that.
Although I do remember that we had the donated subwoofer for 2DX that would vibrate your knees.
Yes.
That was awesome.
What was great, too, is that because we knew the arcade techs, a DDR4 mix machine would load edits that you made at home.
You could actually save a limited number of edits on the machine.
And he would load our edits.
And I remember we had, or at least, I don't know if it was me or you, we had an edit for Kick the Can called Big Cans.
You mean that.
all it was so you could fire up big cans and you'd see it on the machine now playing big cans and what it was is that it would start for like you know the song started with this fun little dance for like four measures and it was just a giant break in the song so people would literally start big cans play the first four measures run a lap around the entire arcade and get back just in time to hit that last right at the end
Remember the Hell Edit competitions too, which I've won lots of good porn that way.
Thank you, Loki.
MakeEditGetPorn, yeah, it was awesome.
That was one of the early things on OLR, I remember MakeEditGetPorn.
Someone passed my Hell Edit, my DXYM Hell Edit.
It was that skinny kid Dave.
He won.
Sign and beat it.
He won, yes, he won.
When we went on the moderator trip for DDR Freak back when.
Sign and beat it.
I bought him dinner.
We can't forget the awesomeness that was at Shaft, that was Wendell's famous roast beef routine.
Yes.
And we, of course, can't forget the travesty that was my attempt at freestyle, which we shall never hear of again, goddammit.
You're the one that brought it up.
Wasn't that the first time I ever did my Dr. Dick character, too?
Ah, yes.
Imagine me doing drag, but not doing drag.
That was my Dr. Dick character that I would do.
Didn't Dr. Dick eventually, though, turn into Mr. Spanky?
On OLR, so OLR is the spiritual successor to all of that.
Like Rob, but gayer.
Anyway, alright, look, we gotta get into... There's gayer than Rob?
Hey!
Alright, we gotta get into... Oh, I'm sorry, that's still supposed to come in a couple weeks.
That's when I get to start attacking you again.
Can't wait.
I guess I have to play nice on your show.
This is a warm-up, warm-up.
Oh, boy.
Oh, no, no, you can continue.
I'm enjoying it.
I'll just sit back here and go, writing this down.
He's like, crap, now I remember what it was like.
so if you think our reminiscing tonight is bad over nine years ago and everything we were doing back then just wait until next year because I'm telling you we're renting the Masonic Lodge or something and we're just gonna we're gonna rule the school and get everybody in one place get out all the DDR pads have like an OLR con or something that's that's my dream for a 10th anniversary thing and get everybody in one roof and just just blow the roof off the place be fun good times
Remember our awesome sack anime panel that we did?
Yeah, when we did the sack anime panel about three years ago?
Oh, that was so... I think I had like a double coffee.
Literally two people showed up.
Yeah, you and one other kid.
But you know what I got out of that whole thing?
My Dalek.
I've got that on reserve for you, Jamie.
Let's move on, guys.
Let's get into your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.
Nine years later, what are the console games or PC games making up your week?
DarkSakura.
I played WoW.
Damn it.
But I'm actually going to be getting myself a month card for Star Trek Online so that my Scottish fleet mates will not keep harassing me.
Are they missing you?
They miss me.
Well, okay, one of my fleet mates is on my Facebook, and he's such a nice guy.
He's actually the first person that I met in-game there that I chatted with, other than someone who was actually role-playing Captain Jack Harkness from Torchwood, which was gorgeous.
But we just ended up chatting, and we were at the same level, and we kept playing, and then he got me into the fleet, and I was like, woo, I get to listen to Scottish men's.
That's awesome.
So I might be getting a month on STO before the funds run dry.
All right.
So thinking about more MMOs to go play.
Initial D Extreme Stage.
We're going to have news later on tonight about a pretty big MMO that is going free to play.
So I'm curious if that's going to be something you're going to want to go to as well.
Be interesting to see.
Because free MMOs are good.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, you can't leave town because you'll just, oh, dead.
Oh, because it was Halloween.
Oop, dead.
That's fun.
Walk along, oop, dead.
That was, that was, the whole thing is like, oh, you're walking along, oh, dead.
We're putting a random mob there.
Yeah, how about no?
Yeah, so no more RO for me.
Alright, well let's go Oh, one more thing Lots of peggle in WoW Because I've been sitting my ass in queue for 35 minutes of pop Because I like DPS too much Done Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
It's okay, I didn't play a whole lot this week.
I played, let's see, more Child of Eden, which is pretty awesome.
I actually got to play it on the HGTV this time.
It does get quite difficult when you're using the controller, like about even the third level in or whatever.
So I'm actually looking forward to trying it with the Kinect.
I think it'll be a lot more accurate.
um, played a bit of Shadows of the Damned which is a very strange game and there's lots of penis references all throughout the game the entire fucking game is just penis references but it's cool where can I buy this game?
at your local store
We actually have a clip from the game.
This is Shadows of the Damned.
This is a clip actually from the Akira Yamaoka soundtrack.
I know a lot of you have been eagerly anticipating hearing some of the soundtrack.
Here you go.
Gentlemen, here's a little number I tossed off recently in the kettlebell.
Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?
Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong?
It's swell to have a stiffy, it's divine to own a dick.
From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick.
So three cheers for your Willie or John Thomas.
Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake.
Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock You can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock But don't take it out in public or they will stick you in the dock And you won't come back Thank you very much
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
LARP
All right, so you've been playing Penis of the Damned, and what, two penises up?
It's awesome.
It's a pretty fun game.
I'm actually looking forward to... No, I'm never going to finish this game.
You know why?
Because Earth Defense Force... Insect Armageddon is going to be coming out not next week, but the week after.
But hey, you know what?
I don't know if I can get it early.
And that's all I'll be playing at the end of this next week, so I don't care about finishing this game or anything else.
because this game will take over my life.
Great, so when we ask you about your gaming week for the next six months, it's just going to be, ah, I played Insect Arm again.
What if it sucks?
It's going to suck.
The first game sucked, but it was fun.
That was the whole point.
I want this game.
It's pretty awesome.
I believe your husband will have it soon.
Really?
Wow, you're a prophet.
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
Grand Theft Auto.
Almost made it a whole week where I was just on a winging streak the entire week.
I did lose one game in the middle there and I was out of day.
I'll try next week.
Sorry, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.
This is like bubble wrap.
It's like the world's biggest bubble wrap.
But you can't pop the bubbles.
So I keep sitting here trying to pop the bubbles on this world's biggest bubble wrap.
And they don't pop, Jessica.
If you rip into it, that's cheating.
You can't use your nails.
I can pop it, but I don't want to ruin that piece of bubble wrap.
Unless I can ruin that piece of bubble wrap.
This is great radio.
The sound of... No, no, no, no, no.
That's cheating.
That is cheating with scissors.
My house, I can cheat.
Can you picture that and put it on the website so at least there's some... All you would have to do is just roll it up into a ball and it would have worked.
I don't see why twisting it would be cheating though.
Alright, Jessica, I know you don't- Thank you!
Oh my gosh, she got one!
That's what I said, you twist it.
Wow.
Alright, Jessica, I know you don't just play DDR.
I play DDR.
You know why I won't do?
Because look at it, it's not just one bubble.
It's multi-bubble.
Enough with the bubble wrap!
We're playing, you know, a game right now.
I was trying to understand the physics behind it, Rob.
Don't you ever watch Mr. Wizard's World?
Don't you ever want to know?
He's dead, Jamie.
And he hated children!
And he hated children.
Anyway, Jessica, how was your gaming week?
I played what I always play.
Lots and lots and lots of Lotro.
And lots and lots of Lotro.
And more Lotro.
Dude, what is it with chicks and MMOs?
Okay, dealer.
It's funny you guys were talking about the whole free MMO thing, because Lotro is a free MMO, though I am a subscriber.
I think it was a good thing for them to do because they brought in a lot of people and it was because of bringing in those people that they gained more of an audience for their subscriptions.
Out of curiosity, when Lotro went free to play, did a lot of the existing fan base say, we're going to reject these free people and this is going to be horrible and we don't want new people coming into our turf?
Was it received with a bunch of negativity?
Well, I wasn't on at that point in time.
I came in a little bit after that, but I do hear even to this day, everything changed when we went free to play.
The types of people that we're playing now are completely different.
I can understand that you're going to end up with a lot more
of a crowd that is flaky.
If people have their money put into a game, then yeah, they're a little bit more indebted to it.
They're going to play it more often.
It just makes sense.
That said, I too have a Star Trek Online account that I pay for monthly that just sits there with my level 10 lieutenant commander.
It doesn't really matter all the time.
You're still going to have the same type of flaky people.
I don't know.
It's topical because there's something else going on this week.
That's why I asked.
The main thing is we're getting ready right now for Isengard is going to be the next update in September.
So everybody's doing their pre-purchase and you get your snazzy stuff like your snazzy horse or your snazzy outfit and everything.
But the one thing I like is I get a 25% XP buff on any of my characters that are below the level cap.
and for me who's right there just barely below the level cap, that helps.
It gives me that little extra push.
Awesome.
Will that bring you up?
Huh?
Will that bring you up to the level?
I'm still working on it.
It's just a 25% extra buff so that you're gaining 25% more XP per kill.
Plus on top of it we're in the middle of the Summer Festival so you automatically are getting a buff from that as well on XP.
So any kills that I've made this weekend have basically just
I'm getting mad, mad XP from.
Cool.
Let me ask this because, you know, Lord of the Rings really isn't big in pop culture right now.
I mean, it was, you know, a few years ago when the movies were coming out.
But, you know, obviously it's always going to have its fan base.
But the reason why I say that is because, you know, we have these Hobbit movies that are on the horizon.
We're hearing more about that.
You know, that's going to kind of bring more attention back in pop culture to all things Lord of the Rings and Tolkien and all that.
So how do you think the MMO will be impacted by the Hobbit?
Oh, I would not be surprised if you would end up seeing a huge surge of people that were going to start joining after that.
I mean, on top of that, you're also we're also seeing a lot of people right now because movie theaters all across the country are showing the original movies on big screen one night per week.
So last week they did, you know, the original.
Now they're doing two towers this week and next week's going to be, you know.
Dan's going to that on Tuesday.
Yeah.
So that in and of itself is getting a lot more interest.
So I look forward to it.
I actually, you know, the kinship that I'm a part of is very newbie friendly.
And we like to be able to help each other kind of move on in the game.
And we welcome anybody, no matter if they're paid to play or not, in our kinship.
Yeah.
Yay, go Arlequins!
Yay!
It's very warm and fuzzy and friendly.
Well, and it helps too.
It helps too because not only do I have two of my old coworkers in my kinship, the leader is somebody that I knew from IRC that I met like way back in the day.
So it's really kind of spiffy that I get to have that kind of connection with two different, completely different portions of my life at the same time.
Awesome.
MMOs, bringing people together.
There you go.
All right.
Drew Nami, anything you want to say about your gaming week and what you've been playing?
I've been playing a bunch of the WoW crack and not really encountering those insane queue times because I play a healer, but I can understand.
What kind of healer are you?
I'm main a priest, but I'm starting up a shaman lately.
You're a 40, right?
Holy Pally's the best.
I never really got into the Holy Pally stuff, but...
Aside from that, I've been playing a lot of Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War 2, Retribution, you know, Electric Boogaloo, over too many subtitles.
And speaking of games that have gone free-to-play, or have been free-to-play for a while, Steam kind of kicked off some stuff, and I kind of got into making a Champions Online character, trying to get into the whole Silver Age thing.
I'm like, ehhh...
I heard Champions Online kind of tepid, like a lot of people weren't really into it when it first came out Then it went free to play and suddenly way more people were into it I was in the beta, it got better, it got better, not great, but it got better But I started up a grimoire named 23, numerologist, yay
You know, a lot of people too with that game forget that they were going to put that on 360 and then at the last minute it just didn't end up happening.
But it's funny because if you plug in an Xbox 360, Alan told me about this, you plug in a 360 controller, it will show... It works.
Yeah, everything shows up with the Xbox buttons and everything.
But not very well.
I tried.
I actually had to struggle to get it not to recognize 360 control and let me use the damn keyboard.
Because I have my controller plugged in all the time.
Mm-hmm.
But aside from that, you know, WoW, Dawn of War, Champions Online, haven't really been playing much.
I've been thinking about getting back into playing some Wii games I'd set on the shelf, playing through No More Heroes 2 again, and just kind of going through my game archive stuff I hadn't finished.
Rogue Galaxy.
That's what I'm doing right now.
Shadow Hearts from the New World.
Just, you know, some older PS2 stuff because I'm a broke ass like that.
Alright, well there you go Lots of archive gaming and free gaming Yeah, also scaring the crap out of myself with Dead Space But that's another story altogether Let's see my gaming week quickly and then we'll get into the gaming news I actually don't have a lot to add to my gaming week this week It's really the same games It's funny because I've been gaming a lot But I have nothing new to share with you all Because I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy XIII I'm finally to the point where the game has opened up
and if you've played through 13 you know exactly what point of the game I'm talking about and you know that took many many hours to get there but I'm actually really into it and again I don't get the 13 hate like this is seriously one of my favorite Final Fantasy games like I like it more Nate that's for sure so I'm having a great time with it so I am gonna play it through to completion and that is because even though yes some of the characters are just so
I really, really have a boner for Fang, who is an amazing character.
Love her.
Strong woman, like her.
I'm just playing for Fang at this point.
She's great.
And I like Lightning, too.
Is that Fang Service?
Yes, it's Fang Service.
I see Drew Nami is rubbing off on you.
He's sitting next to me.
I'm getting infected.
Also, Warcraft, Mortal Kombat played online for a little bit with Extifer from the other show, Horde House.
He's really getting into Mortal Kombat.
It's really funny.
He's almost beat story mode, I think.
Thanks for watching!
Nothing really new to share.
Hopefully in the coming weeks I will.
I actually have some racing games sitting at home that came from my rental service that I'm waiting to play.
So I'm hoping I'll have a Need for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited 2 things to say in the coming weeks because I have both of those sitting at home.
I want to know who the fuck Penis Man is.
Again, one of those sound clips I'd like to save to a soundboard and use on a rainy day sometime.
Chat.orangelandre.com if you would like to offend DarkSakura with your name.
It's Breakman.
Anyhow, let's move on to... We're going to get into gaming news, but first some housekeeping tonight.
Good Lord, it's been nine years.
If you haven't already, you really should follow us on Twitter.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
And you can also follow us on Facebook.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
And yeah, please join us on those sites.
And of course, I want to plug one more time.
Jess Carper is here tonight to help plug Under Sedation Live, which is the show that was before Orange Lounge Radio.
It was actually on that show.
That was a show born of the Rocky Horror Community.
I don't think a lot of people know that.
Right.
Right.
Understation Live is on Saturday nights at 8 o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern So it's a late show It's understationlive.org And Travis actually just revamped the entire website this week
and on top of that he just updated all of the podcasts so now everything is up there up to week before last he didn't do last week's because it was a solo show because I was out and about so yeah basically everything through episode 36 is up on the web
Did you kidnap a child?
I kidnapped a child
Alright, anyhow, let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.
Loki.
So, Monday, this coming up Monday, there's going to be some stuff going down in California.
The case Brown vs. EMA, which is formally Schwarzenegger vs. EMA, involving California's attempt to enforce a law written by...
Thank you, Leland Yee, a Democrat representing San Francisco in 2005, that would criminalize the sale of hyper-violent games to kids.
And it's not necessarily all M-rated games, but only certain types of games as defined by the law.
These new games would need to be labeled specially and carry a $1,000 fine to those who are found in violation of the law.
If the court rules for California, it will be overturning a half decade's worth of decisions in lower courts that said California's law violated First Amendment protections of freedom of speech.
um apparently also it doesn't necessarily mean if the court decides that it's against um you know the first amendment it says they could still direct the state in how to write the law that would criminalize the sale of games to kids without violating the constitution um
I don't know.
So basically, if they win, they're going to separate video games from music, movies, and books and all their forms of entertainment, singling them out, preventing them from going to be sold for minors and stuff like that.
Okay, what?
DarkSakura is saying, is this more important than a Supreme Court hearing on video games?
Yes, it is.
Does it change the way we buy games?
Yes, it is.
I'm dying to hear this.
It's cake.
Oh.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday, dear Rob.
Happy birthday to you.
Oh, thank you, guys.
Yeah, it's my birthday, too.
Not just the show's.
I have to make a wish?
Yes.
Okay, do I have to say my wish or do I have to keep a secret?
You can tell us after the show.
One, two... Way to blow, Rob.
He sure knows how to blow.
He's gone from suck to blow.
Yay, I blew them all out.
Yay.
Thank you for not setting the cake on fire.
I appreciate that.
Because there are not 30 candles on that cake.
There's...
Far less.
I'll get plates while Loki finishes his story.
See?
Told you!
Alright, and that's not a Bel-Air cake.
That is a homemade cake.
Becky made the icing and everything from scratch.
That's great.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Becky!
You're welcome!
Isn't she sneaky?
Anyhow.
So yeah, it sucks and hopefully it doesn't pass.
Because, I mean, seriously, there's enough reasons to hate the government in California.
And Leland Yee, seriously, this guy has a hard-on for writing terrible laws that involve protecting the children.
What douche.
Sorry, I was relaying for the chatroom that they wanted a picture.
You know, all that neutering, all that happy just neutered my rant.
I know, right?
It's like, I wanted to say a lot of angry things, but how can I be mad?
Someone bake me a cake.
But...
Seriously, what the hell is this supposed to solve?
Ignorant parents are still going to buy their kids M-rated games and not worry about it.
Drew, I kind of feel like this discussion is like – I mean I'm not invalidating your point, but it's kind of like there's nothing we can do about this now.
The reality is tomorrow is a huge day because – and what I'm reminded of is –
Other news that came out, it was either this week or last week about cigarette label warnings are supposed to get even bigger and like more, they're like the Canadian warnings now where like in Canada you buy the pack of smokes and it shows like the decayed lungs and all that stuff and it's like, okay, we get the point, God.
You know, it's the same point with both of them.
and DarkSakura.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
to keep their family-friendly appearances.
Period.
End of story.
It should be done the same as movies.
Why can't it just mirror movies?
Because these are interactive, Rob!
You have to understand, people are playing the role of the killer instead of watching the killer brutally kill people.
I have a hard time believing that the penis game is worse for kids than the human centipede.
I'm sorry.
or any of the Saw movies they can't be consistent because that would actually make sense and they lose their jobs if they actually make sense it's all about trying to get a platform so he gets voted in or something like that I don't even know what the point of this is
Are legal analysts trying to predict this one way or the other?
Does anybody have a reading on which way this is going to go?
They figured that the way that this law has gone in other states, it's not going to pass.
And here's the best thing apart.
The best part about it is it's our tax money that the state is using to fight this thing.
Thanks.
I want a refund.
Well, that's not having the intended effect then.
I really am...
I like how they handle it in England, where movies and games have the same rating system.
I'm so with you.
I'm so with you.
Just give games the exact... I mean, I guess we're kind of past the point of no return, so to speak.
We've already had this rating system that's been established and in place for years.
It's not that difficult to understand the rating system, though.
I mean, how...
Much more do we need to explain.
I don't think it's necessarily that these people don't know what the rating system is or that these games are violent.
I think they just don't care.
It's just like, oh, I don't care if I get cancer from smoking or I don't care if I get liver damage from drinking.
They just don't care.
And no amount of laws and stickers and banners and...
and whatever are going to get these people to care anymore.
Unless you say, oh, you bought this for your child, we're going to fine you $1,000, then... In the immortal words of Bill Murray, it just doesn't matter.
Or how about Dennis Leary?
It's a drug, we're addicted!
Some not very encouraging words from Blackwolf in the chatroom.
Saying, Sky, the mock trials that some law schools have done said that the Supreme Court will side with California.
Well, then they're dumb.
I'm sorry.
That's sad.
We're in a really sad state.
If they single this out, then they need to fight this.
They need to appeal it and they need to fight it.
It's the Supreme Court, Loki.
You can't appeal that.
There is no court higher in the land than the Supreme Court.
I'm sorry though, but you're singling, basically you're restricting the freedom of expression because you're restricting the sale of these certain games.
Which have not even been proven to cause any harm to children anyways.
Crime rates actually decreased since the Super Nintendo came out.
So there's no, it's not like, you know, smoking, that's a pretty easy distinction.
You're talking about all hypothetical stuff, we don't...
There's no... Like, playing a violent video game doesn't make me catch on fire or, you know, doesn't make my lungs deteriorate.
It's just a game.
Loki, welcome to America, home of unnecessary moral panic.
It was like this for D&D, it was like that for Doom, it's gonna continue.
And how many of us who were raised on D&D are sacrificing chickens in the backyard?
Don't check my backyard, Jamie, I swear to God.
Here's my thing.
If this comes down tomorrow and it doesn't go the way we think it should, the only way you can quote-unquote retaliate is with your vote and stop voting for people that are going to shove moral righteousness down our throat.
Do not vote for Leland Yee.
Who is voting for Leland Yee?
San Francisco, I blame you.
This is all your damn fault.
Is he his sister?
I thought he was SoCal.
No, he's San Francisco.
He's San Francisco, and guess what?
You know, this is the same type of shit that they passed over there was banning toys from Happy Meals because that'll get people to stop buying fast food for their children.
Yeah, people not being stupid will do that.
Well, San Francisco's also got the whole thing about, what is it, they want to ban circumcision or something like that.
Oh, yeah.
Listen, San Francisco, you're already fucking strange enough as it is.
Clearly, there are other things we need to legislate.
But then you go, well, everybody is... You do that, that's going to start coming into line with religious tolerance groups.
Because the Anti-Defamation League has already gotten in on that.
Everybody in San Francisco has healthcare.
And whether you're a fan of socialized healthcare or not, you have to admit, that's quite a feat that they're doing it.
I mean, that it's happening there.
Whether you're a fan of that theory or not, you gotta say, wow, that is quite a political feat that they're doing it.
Yeah, here's what they're doing.
They're wasting money is what they're doing.
They're wasting money by giving everybody healthcare, whether you deserve it or not.
And they're also wasting money with all these fucking laws that they're trying to pass.
No, we... They deserve... Yeah, you know what?
They're not fucking working.
They don't deserve healthcare.
You gotta pitch in to get something back.
You know what?
What about if somebody... You know what?
I will tell you this right now, and you're about to get the verbal bitch slap from me.
I got laid off of my job.
I have been applying.
Dan has been applying.
Neither of us have insurance right now.
And if he had another heart attack, what would we do?
He would die.
End of story.
Because we can't afford... I understand that, but you were working at one time, so you have already contributed to society.
There were a lot of people that are homeless on the street now because they lost their jobs, their houses were foreclosed on, and they have nowhere to live.
We know a person personally in that circumstance.
So yeah, think before you say shit like that, please.
I'm sorry, it's my opinion, okay?
I don't care.
Some of these people that are homeless, they choose to be homeless.
There's been tons of studies where people have tried to help these people out, and sure enough, they give them money or whatever, and they're back on the street again because they can't fend for themselves.
Nine years stands for... It's a stint in the ranks right there.
Well, it's like a married couple, but I could cue up the penis song again if that's what we need.
Let's just work towards getting our money spent on more important things, like putting shrimp on treadmills.
All I'm saying is that they're passing a lot of these laws.
Why don't you work on a state budget?
How about that?
Because they don't have that taken care of yet.
Yeah, but that's the city and not the state.
Okay, so yeah, tomorrow, big day for gamers.
It's going to be interesting.
I like cake.
This cake is delicious.
And it's not a lie.
This is legitimate cake.
And it's hilarious because I used to own those very same plates.
I've lost control.
You've had control?
Yeah, I never did.
Hey, let's talk about the PlayStation 4.
Nintendo has announced the Wii U.
And Jack Trenton said to Forbes, I didn't see anything about Nintendo's announcement that said, oh, we'd better get working on rolling out a new PlayStation here pretty soon.
What we've seen from the competition is trying to add features that already exist in the PlayStation 3.
We've invested heavily in that, and we've rolled a very heavy rock up a steep hill through the launch period.
But now I think that all pays off, and we've got a long runway behind it.
Very interesting that they call it a steep hill, kind of admitting that it was a rough launch for them.
He has a point, and the point is, also, if you think about it, Nintendo has never developed HD games.
I mean, they're way behind everybody else as far as putting out games that are high definition.
I don't know, it sells consoles, I guess they haven't had to so far.
Yeah, but you see, they'll get you only so far, then they realize, oh, hey, people that are hardcore gamers, the ones actually purchasing games other than, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort, um,
Let's assume they have enough money to buy an HDTV, first of all.
And then let's develop HD games.
You're right, because no one has HDTVs nowadays.
Oh my god, I'm just... Where am I going to find people that own HDTVs out there?
Everywhere is where I'm going to find them because they sell them everywhere and people have already adopted to that and they've already adopted to new HD formats.
I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.
I'm still busy watching UHF and sending out newsletters on a mimeograph.
Sorry.
I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.
Well, I think also you have to look at this.
Now, you know, we're at this point where, yeah, there's some people that still have their standard definition TVs because they haven't had to upgrade.
But inevitably, those TVs will fail.
All TVs will fail.
And you can't buy a standard definition TV anymore unless it's at a garage sale or something.
I mean, if you go into a Target or a Walmart, you all only have HDTVs to choose from now.
I need to actually have a UHF-capable TV.
So.
Ah, alright.
So yeah, in a nutshell, he's basically saying, well, I don't see the need to hurry up and develop the PlayStation 4, because it looks to me like Nintendo's just trying to get up to the level of the PlayStation 3.
Bitch slap.
Funny for the ones that were a little late to the party with Move and shit like that.
Yeah.
And also, to their point, they're on the 10-year life cycle or whatever, so they're not going to deviate from that.
And I don't think you're going to see the same thing happening with Microsoft either, because they're confident that the Kinect is going to drive the console for the next five years or whatever.
And Nintendo, really, sales are dipping, and no one really gives a crap about...
there's gonna be the people that will buy every fucking Mario game that comes out Mario Kart game and Animal Crossing game even if it's just slightly different than the last one because they're suckers for that kind of stuff now at the same time though they need to get with it
because, you know, a standard definition console isn't going to cut it when, you know, let's say the next console generation rolls around, and they're going to be playing some catch-up when, you know, the next generation comes around, even though it is going to be able to pull, push a little bit better graphics than, you know, the 360 is, but they have to know how to use it.
Now, the third-party developers probably won't have a problem with that because they're used to developing HD games, but...
and Nintendo themselves.
I think you're going to see them struggling trying to figure out how to utilize this console.
And I think they're going to go more of the gimmicky route where cartoon graphics and shit with the touchscreen.
Yeah, they tend to be a little more agile as far as consoles go.
Thanks for watching!
In an interview with Famitsu Magazine, Suhei Yoshida, who's the president of Worldwide Studios for Sony, said that the reach-around panel almost was not on the final design because of cost.
Sony was not sure that it would really impact gameplay and maybe it's not worthy of the sticker price.
They say once people actually got their hands on it, that it became a must-have feature.
Some small elements of the Vita's design are still subject to change.
So we'll see what happens.
DarkSakura
We have some other news that is, well, it's Wii related.
How bad do you want Xenoblade for Wii?
How many people want it?
Well, apart from that, there's also the last story, Pandora's Tower.
Those are the set right there that actually people are asking to have released outside of Japan and Europe.
So we're hoping that Nintendo can bring it to the U.S.,
Online Petitions, Letter Writing, Physical Letters
Is it maybe something they're keeping in their hat for if Wii U gets delayed?
Well, there's more though.
Xenoblade was at E3 under a different name.
And they actually flat out asked Reggie about the titles and he just went, Oh, look, Pony.
I'm sorry, that's not a Mario game.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Take it from a Tales of fan, this shit never works.
This petitioning never ever works.
Well, it might work if you can get a million people to sign it.
Not even.
If they want to screw a particular audience, they will.
You know what I think?
And this is what I think for a lot of the big import titles or the big Japan-only releases that we want to see in America.
Do it like they handled the remastered Macross DVDs.
where you have a price set for if we have this many pre-orders, the game will be this price.
And we'll do it.
This is what it's gonna cost plus standard profit margin.
And then we get more pre-orders to this level, the price goes down.
We get more orders to this level, the price goes down.
So kind of a kickstart thing.
Since we're reminiscing about the past a lot tonight, it reminds me of what Konami did for Beatmania 2DX7 style when that finally came out on home consoles.
They basically said, if we can get 10,000 people to pre-order the game, we'll make it.
And it amazes me to this day that they got away with something like that.
Because you're putting down a full pre-order on a game you don't even know it's going to happen or not.
So it's kind of weird.
But if they say they're not going to do it, then they have to refund the money.
Yeah, I know that.
But it's still weird that so many people are willing to kind of put down the money up front on a maybe.
You know what I mean?
It's just crazy.
Fans will do stuff.
But you notice I brought up the Macross box set?
They did that.
It actually worked.
And the price went down for like a full series box set to something way low.
Just throw it away.
Hmm.
and you know if they do this I'm going to put this up because that's his middle finger folks because it's not a TV show uh yeah because I'm sorry it's it's stupid why make all your fans of your system jump through hoops to get a game put out over here you either do it because you want to put it out or you don't do it don't make people beg for it I mean
The bottom line, money.
It's all back to money.
It's a company, they need to make a profit.
And the Wii is not selling software right now.
And remember, it's all about ease of getting these games out.
It's a lot easier for them to take a GameCube game, pretty the graphics up a little bit, and port it back out, and call it like an anniversary collection or some bullshit like that.
And then charge, you know, 50 bucks, and then people will, you know, totally eat it up.
Or...
Apparently now Rob is called Roger.
It's alright, I'll take it.
Thank you.
Or they can spend the money it's going to take to localize a game that's pretty awesome.
They're not going to do that because localizing a game is going to take a lot of time.
and so on and so forth.
But now they're just saying, listen, we're just going to take properties that are over in Japan and just bring them over instead of making our own shit.
So that's who you need to pitch that game to is one of those companies.
Sounds like they're going to be the next Working Designs.
And they will basically do it for you.
Of course, after they get done with President Cat because they haven't started on President Cat yet and so we don't have that yet.
That's right.
You can't have the last story until we get President Cat.
That's just the way it's going to be.
All right, moving on.
Loki, what do you got for us?
So free-to-play, it's something that I believe when Nintendo was asked about it, they said, nope, we have no plans on putting anything free on our marketplace, you bastards.
At least as far as free-to-play MMOs or something like that.
Well, Microsoft's actually kind of feeling out with developers to see if they can get some free-to-play games.
and I guess they're now contacting studios discussing the possibility of free-to-play games and building some sort of infrastructure for the 360 that incorporates microtransactions.
Because they were like, Free Realms is so awesome on the PlayStation 3 and we want a game on Xbox where you can play as a fairy.
I don't think that they're necessarily doing that, but I think that they see the profit that, say, Farmville or the Smurfs Village stuff.
That makes a lot of money, and some people are looking for that kind of thing.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Would you be interested in free-to-play games on the Xbox, Loki?
No.
No?
Why not?
Just because the quality is less?
It's usually not the type of games that I want to play.
If it was like a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto MMO or something, that's a little different.
I'd at least check it out like you know uh heck I even played Yaris for like 10 seconds so all right um let's move on with some more gaming news and I'm gonna get to a story about PlayStation hardware in Japan I believe there's a new bundle that has uh come out there in Japan it's a
Charcoal Black Console, decreased power consumption they're saying, a 320 gig hard drive with it.
It's model CECH3000B and it was announced by Sony in Japan over the weekend.
It is going to be 34,980 yen and there will also be a 160 gig version of the model that will come with Tales of Zillia that is coming for $470 so you can get that game.
Not coming in this new bundle, an HDMI cable.
That is true.
And you know what else is coming in that bundle?
New game encryption.
Oh, is that really why they're trying to get the hardware out there?
They're putting out new hardware that's going to change the way the keys are stored.
Although it's got to have some sort of backwards compatibility because or I remember they're moving the instead of having the actual keys built in or the authentication keys built into the console itself it's being built into the blu-ray drive much like how the 360 works whereas they have it you know all the authentication stuff is through the blu-ray drive.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us before we get to release dates?
Well, we have some little buggies fixed with the 3DS.
There were a couple of problems the different consumers were saying that was going on.
And according to Mr. Reggie, he says they're fixed.
He said that the eShop is fixing one of them because, well... It didn't launch with the eShop.
It didn't shop with... yeah.
And the other thing is that...
They're basically... The biggest hang-up was that they didn't have a big Nintendo franchise.
So they said they're fixing that too.
In other words, we had no launch games.
Basically, is what I'm hearing out of that.
Well, that's why I didn't buy one.
Their strongest launch title was from Capcom.
I think it was Dead or Alive.
Unless you want to count Pilotwings.
Dead or Alive was apparently very terrible.
I've heard from a lot of people that Dead or Alive was really good.
Technically, it didn't launch with Dead or Alive.
I mean, Launch Window or whatever you want to call it.
That is some bullshit there, Launch Window.
Technically, it launched with the web store because it was within the Launch Window.
Well, how about I pay you at the end of the Launch Window?
How's that sound?
That doesn't work?
No.
I'm excited about, like, the idea that Netflix might come to the 3DS.
Because I like the idea of having kind of like the portable device to watch.
I mean, granted, I know there's the phone, but also not just the portable, like, thing in the bed with, I think, as a larger screen on those things, but also the possibility of actual 3D movies.
Even though a lot of 3D movies are kind of eh, it's kind of cool in a way.
I don't think it's going to be able to do 3D right since it's all lenticular anyway.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey, you gotta admit, if Tron's gonna end up on 3D Netflix, you gotta at least check that out.
That's gonna be pretty awesome.
You know, it was funny, right before Tron was coming out, Dan was like, let's go get a 3D TV, let's go get a 3D TV.
Tron's coming out, let's go get a 3D TV.
I'm like, no.
So.
Alright, so we'll see.
I'm really curious to see how 3DS will sell this holiday.
This is definitely going to be a make or break time for 3DS.
Well, I was just a little annoyed that they're talking about franchises coming out.
Look at all the things we announced that are going to be coming out.
All these different franchises that aren't coming out until the fourth quarter.
The 3DS is going to get really awesome soon.
Soon, like in a few months.
Right now you have a paperweight.
Enjoy your blue brick.
I gotta tell you though, I mean, based off of what's scheduled to come out for the 3DS, it's not all that exciting.
It's about as exciting as the DS is.
Unless you're really into Ocarina of Time, I mean, that's one of the stronger titles right now.
Yeah, but even new release stuff, there's really not anything exclusive for it.
It's like, oh my god, I gotta have that.
All right, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.
What can you get at a store near you for some other consoles in your house this week in the U.S.?
Well, today, and I know this was on everybody's radar, but Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave incident out for the Nintendo Wii.
Yes, that's the same.
I got to go get my preorder.
That's the same franchise that was on the DS.
Ooh, I'm so excited about that.
Thank you, Nintendo.
Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition on the 360 in case you don't own a console version of Super Street Fighter 4 you can buy that with the DLC already in there otherwise you can just download the DLC and that's on 360 and PS3 another game series that really a lot of people don't care about Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 yes they've made three of them now and that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well
Sniper, Ghost Warrior finally making its way out on PS3 A re-release of Call of Duty Black Ops now the limited edition with the First Strike download content bundled in there Resident Evil The Mercenaries for the 3DS I believe we have a story about that later What other fun stuff is coming out this week Mystery Stories Curse of the Ancient Spirit
UFC Personal Trainer, The Ultimate Fitness System
Power Smash 4
The Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition comes out in Japan as well And Test Drive Unlimited 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the Xbox 360 Going over to the PlayStation 3 in Japan Initial D Extreme Stage gets a price reduction As does Senjou no Valkyria, which I believe is Valkyria Chronicles over there in Japan Gets its price reductions Power Smash 4, or Virtua Tennis, also on the PlayStation 3 this week It's a big Sega week
and the same games Super Street Fighter 4 and Test Drive Unlimited 2 all making their way to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
Going over to some other consoles, how about the Sony PSP?
We have Initial D Street Stage getting a price reduction as well as some other releases.
Two Heart 2 Dungeon Travelers comes out in regular and limited edition.
Again, that's for the PSP.
This is a game, it's an RPG where...
I guess it's kind of like they're reliving their childhood fantasies or something, but then you have the chick in the maid outfit with her legs up, and you're like, I don't want to think about childhood fantasies and see those pictures, so I don't know.
It's a very... Kind of childhood fantasies.
Are they having pedo bear childhood fantasies?
That actually makes me think of an anime that I started watching.
On the Wii, do I even want to know what anime?
Are you sure it was an anime?
It's called something like My Little Sister Can't Be That Cute.
And basically this guy finds out that his sister, who's totally cool and popular with all of her friends and everything, is a closet otaku.
And her fandom is Little Sister Hentai.
On the Wii, Biohazard and Biohazard Zero get a price reduction.
The show itself isn't dirty, but she's into it.
Oh, Japan, never change.
You heard about the guy in Canada, right?
Brought manga over there and got arrested because of their child pornography laws or something like that.
Weird.
It faces a minimum of a year in jail.
Jeez.
Apparently all manga is banned there.
I guess it makes the video game laws here not seem so bad.
and then you can play the game and then remember how much better it was on the Nintendo 64 lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week Tales of the Abyss from Bandai Namco which is this an official Tales game?
Yes, it is.
It happens to be my favorite Tales game.
Well, guess what?
It's on the 3DS this week.
In Japan.
God damn it, Japan.
God damn it, Namco.
You can import it on your region free.
Oh, wait.
No, you can't.
Oh, wait.
That's right.
They got rid of that on the 3DS.
See, that's what I was talking about.
Namco always screwing over anything that's not Japanese.
Ore no Emoto ga Kona ni Kawaii Wake ni Ganai
It's actually really funny.
So are you stroking Penis Man's ego in the chat?
On the 28th, we have Call of Duty Black Ops, Annihilation Pack, whereas my brain initially saw it Black Oops.
And then on the 29th, we have Backbreaker Vengeance, which sounds kind of dirty.
And then Half Minute Heroes, Super Mega Neo Climax.
Which also sounds kind of dirty.
I know.
I wouldn't want to meet the half-minute hero.
That series is actually kind of cool.
That 30-second hero, whatever they call it here, is actually kind of fun.
It's a neat series.
I just wouldn't want to meet the half-minute hero in his climax.
Didn't they have that come out in Xbox Live Arcade?
I think I dated him.
Did he post on DDR Freak 2?
Shushu.
Oh.
Bob gets it.
Alright.
No.
I only have one thing to say about that game.
What's that?
Spoot.
Moving on.
Two more stories for you and then the classic game of the week.
So, I know this isn't the 90s and this isn't the Matrix but apparently Ubisoft wants you to beat Neo at Child of Eden.
A game that's sort of like the Matrix because you're I know Kung Fu.
Flying around.
Less Keanu Reeves.
But no, the artist Neo.
Apparently he has a high score on the Evolution level.
And to, I guess, boost Ubisoft's donation of the Japanese Earthquake Relief, you have to try to beat his score.
100,000 is already pledged, but for every score on the level, it's normal Connect leaderboard exceeding Neo's.
306,800 points between now and July 4th Ubisoft will add an additional dollar up to a maximum of $20,000 why Neo?
I don't understand why that artist out of you know I just don't think of Neo when I think of Child of Eden you know
Maybe he's a fan of the game.
Maybe Samuel L. Jackson had something else going on.
Ice-T, you know, he was too busy pimping Call of Duty.
Let me just compare a little bit here, okay?
We have Neo.
Ready?
Here's Neo.
Okay, I think I've heard that song at the club before, right?
So there's Neo, and then here is Child of Eden.
That's right, you're getting a headache because those two don't go together.
Completely different key.
Whatever.
I guess whatever brings awareness to the game.
And then there's been lots of, boo, this game I paid for five years ago is now free and that makes me angry.
Because, you know, games don't ever go on sale or... Oh no, that's totally not how I wound up with most of my Steam collection anyway.
There are so many butthurt people.
about this going free-to-play.
There are apparently servers that are auto-banning people that are detected on the free-to-play version.
There are people that are just like, our game is ruined because of free-to-play and so forth.
And to those people, I say, fuck off immediately because you are what's wrong with gaming right now.
Cry some more.
That whole elitist asshole attitude just isn't going to get you anywhere, like in life, period.
It reminds me of when Steam had the free weekends of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2, and Black Ops.
There was nothing but disdain to lower level folk because they were trial noobs.
They were weekend warriors.
They were too cheap to buy the real thing.
I'm like, dude, fuck you.
I might actually buy it if you guys weren't such dicks.
Yeah, I mean, and the game is five years old.
And to be fair, Valve, although they have done so many updates over the past few years and so forth, this has gotten people talking about the game more than anything in quite some time.
It's just a refreshing break from complaining about hats.
I guess so.
That could be true.
But yeah, I mean, I for one, I downloaded the game some time ago.
I paid for it, you know, it came with the orange box.
And I'm not mad that it went free to play because I realized I bought it several years ago and I could have been playing it then this entire time.
I didn't because I got old.
Why did it get old to me?
I had nobody to play with because I don't want to play with elitist assholes.
Well, gee, I'm sorry, Rob.
You should have poked me sometime.
But...
Not in that way, not that way.
Just buy me a drink first.
But, I mean, for real though, like, this news, if anything, makes me maybe want to go back and play Team Fortress 2 because I know there'll be other people to play with who will be as terrible as me or at least not be jerks about it if they are pretty good.
You know what I mean?
Otherwise, I hadn't really given this game a second thought, and yet I don't feel like I wasted my money.
The Orange Box was one of the best deals ever in gaming.
Ever one of the best deals.
Oh yeah, but where were people complaining when Portal became free for a limited time?
Hmm?
Oh wait, that's not multiplayer.
We're not an unpleasable fanbase when it comes to that, are we?
MeltedGeneral in our chat says Team Fortress 2 is on its 218th update.
That is a lot of updates.
Did it have you start downloading the Team Fortress 2 beta?
I don't know because I bought the game years ago.
I bought mine a long time ago and suddenly I looked on there and it says downloading Team Fortress 2 beta.
Which is weird.
It might be a free beta or something, who knows.
The Rob D in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, I'm pissed in the way anyone is when something goes on sale after they bought it.
I don't feel like Valve should refund me or anything such as life.
That's kind of how I feel, too.
These deals, this is just how it works.
You have to shop around for the best deals, and if you don't, oh well on you, you know?
Just cry some more and play that goddamn game.
I'll tell you that, I would have been pissed if I'd bought Team Fortress 2 like two weeks ago, but I would have been pissed in the way that somebody who buys Apple products gets pissed every year.
Or people who get used to one Adobe Suite.
Only to find out that CS6 is coming out in a few months.
Fuck you, Adobe.
DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, Team Fortress 2 going free?
Great.
And I also bought the Orange Box.
Surprised it didn't go free sooner.
I haven't heard a lot of the FPSs or hell even the Valve-owned games going free-to-play.
Will Half-Life Episode 3 be free-to-play?
Well, for what it's worth, as long as you paid some sort of money in Team Fortress 2, you get perks.
You're not leaving us out in the lurch completely.
All of this, and Dungeon Buster, it was a TF2 going free.
Great, I also bought the Orange Box.
I have the Orange Box, I have it on Xbox.
Guess what?
I like playing it better on my PC, so all this stuff going free?
Woo!
Also in our chatroom, PenisMan asks, So are we going to form an all-games Team Suck?
Sure, works for me.
If that name isn't already taken, which it probably is.
I'll roll up the group name when I get home.
All right, there you go.
Team Suck.
I could do it.
Actually, there is, well, there isn't, to be real, there is an OLR team already out there.
Yeah.
It's something Dekeman put together a long time ago.
So, I mean, there is already an OLR team.
And, you know, I'm not saying this in a negative way, but they suck.
or at least they will when I start playing on it we don't need your help to suck Rob Blackwolf wants to clarify yeah except Apple will refund you within a certain time frame you know if I had bought Team Fortress 2 two weeks ago which I don't know who did but I wonder if you were to call Valve and complain if maybe they would give a refund who knows
DarkSakura.com
and find the most obscure fucking game she can to be the game of the week.
Which I believe is the case this week, correct?
Yes, actually.
I will say something.
This is a game that I have talked about before.
So, it's not really a surprise.
It's probably a surprise to people that haven't brought it up already.
So, the game of the week is called Emerald Dragon.
and importers, PC Engine fans, you will know this one.
Lots of dialogue, by the way.
The game is an RPG done by Glodia, which they did, they're actually created by Telnet employees, including Tenpei Sato, who was behind Disgaea.
So, this game could be, in theory, a precursor to Disgaea.
Does it have prinnies?
I only played through the first very part of it, Rob.
I was like, I can't read that much Japanese.
It's a valid question.
Anyway, it came out for PC-88 in 1989, and then came to PC-98, X68000, MSX2, FM Towns Computer, and then the console versions were the PC Engine CD and Super Famicom, but they weren't done by Gloria.
So there's no versions that are outside of Japan, but you can get a fan translation for the Super Famicom version by Translation Corporation, so look for it if you really want to play it.
So basically, it's a big RPG, there was a war in the past, and then lots of battle, and then there were two races that lived on the main continent, and the Emerald Dragon was our champion, and then the Emerald Dragon died and a curse fell over the land, blah blah blah.
So now the last dragons are around, and you have to pretty much help them out.
You actually find a green-haired girl whose name is Tamarin, which means purity in the ancient dragon language.
Ooh.
We'll call her Virgin.
Virgin.
But anyway, she has amnesia, so I won't spoil the game for you.
There's also Barsim, Farna, Hathrom, Corsraw, lots of different people.
But basically, it's a traditional JRPG.
But it has some pretty different combat.
It has a large world to look over.
But it's one big unified piece, except in the Super Famicom version.
Dude, the combat in this looks like Ultima.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It reminds me of Treasure Hunter G, another gem that never made it to the States.
The combat looks dead on like Treasure Hunter G. Well, if they came out around the same time, then that could, you know, or by a similar team.
One was made by Square, and the other, yeah.
Well, at any rate...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
At any rate, with the Super Famicom version of this game, it has a dragon transformation system so Attrition can take on a dragon form.
And it's pretty cool.
I have the PC Engine version.
I have a copy of the PC Engine version of this, I should say.
Because the game costs in excess of $300 on eBay.
On PC Engine.
Yikes.
One of my friends has this game, which is how I got my copy.
She's also the same one who hooked us up with Dracula X when she owed us $100.
Basically, it's standard PC Engine fare as far as the screens.
You've got the 16-bit sprites, and then you've got lots of voice acting because, hey, we're doing these games on a CD now, not on HuCards.
and all the audio in it is Redbook Audio.
So you can actually just pop the CD in your car as long as you skip track two.
Nice.
So, but that is one of, I think, the gems in any PC Engine collector's archive.
Like, if I had to have three games in my PC Engine... Actually, no, I don't have a copy of this one.
I have Sapphire.
No, I don't have Sapphire.
So if I had to have three games that were in the top tier of PC Engine, it would be Dracula X, which I've got.
Emerald Dragon, and Sapphire.
So this is Emerald Dragon.
There it is, your classic game of the week.
Very obscure, very hard to find, but very intricate for its time with the voice acting and everything.
Emerald Dragon.
It actually makes it more playable, too.
Because then I at least have somewhat of a clue of what's going on in the game.
Yeah, if I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and like... Oh, look, it's Farna.
If I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and not pay like, you know, 300 bucks for it, I would be pretty stoked.
Your Classic Game of the Week, Emerald Dragon on the PC Engine.
And that's going to bring us to the close of Part A. But don't go anywhere, guys.
We're going to come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
Lots of news in Part B tonight.
Some music game-based news, believe it or not.
We're going to kick it off with your Twitter topics.
So get those in.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Any topics?
Like news stories and so forth Or if you just have a question you want to ask us You know, it's the birthday show and all Maybe there's something that's burning on your mind that you want to ask us Or perhaps our guests, one of the two Jessica Harper from Motor Station Live is of course here at the studio Or intern Drew, maybe you have a question for them You can send those to twitter.com slash OLR And we'll have more stories coming up for you guys FUs of the week, Skype calls, and plenty more When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Orange Lounge Radio
We're joined in studio tonight, not only by, of course, my co-host, DarkSakura, Loki, always here with us, but by some special guests.
Intern Drew is in the kitchen, but here in studio with us, the lovely Jessica Harper from Understation Live.
Hi.
How you doing?
That's getting birthday spankings later this month for its 10th anniversary show.
I mean next month, because we're late June, so next month, I guess.
Within a month.
Exactly.
Basically two weeks from now-ish.
Exactly.
and we've been spending a lot of the time earlier in the show kind of reminiscing about the good old days of OLR back when we were playing a lot of DDR and so forth and for those that haven't heard the story Jessica and I actually played DDR for the first time together
You know you wanna play my head
Exactly.
And we actually skipped, what was it, Shock Treatment or something on Friday, which is a shitty movie anyway.
Yeah, basically we were bored to tears.
We just wanted to relax and go have some casino time.
We're having our own convention.
Yeah.
We're like, okay, let's go get drunk across the way over at Quark's Bar.
Exactly.
Since we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Rocky Horror community anyway, why don't we just go play DDR?
Exactly.
We had fun.
It was a good time.
But also that weekend, and I bring this up because this is kind of topical as of recently, but...
We went to the Adventure Dome
But, you know, we were at the Adventure Dome, and one of the things that they had there, and we spent a little money on, about 20 bucks on, and it was a memory that would haunt me forever.
And ever.
And ever.
And ever.
And ever.
And you have to keep in mind that this was 11 years ago.
Yes.
This is even older than Understation Live or Orange Launch Radio.
We taped a karaoke video.
Oh.
Yes.
Jessica and I taped a karaoke video, and I seem to remember I let Jess pick the song, and she wanted to do Love Shack, which Jessica's got quite a set of pipes on her.
If you've never heard her sing, she's actually quite very good, and she can kind of do that.
Love!
Love, Shaq!
I would go, Funky Little Shaq, Funky Little Shaq.
I'm trying to read the words as they highlight, which in the song is, Funky Little Shaq.
Yeah, I got the song later.
And that actually became our karaoke song.
When Rob and I used to go out to karaoke on a fairly regular basis, that was one of our songs that we did together.
Other than, what was the other one?
Human League.
Don't You Want Me Baby.
So yeah, we actually did kind of eventually incorporate it into our repertoire.
So, but it's interesting because whereas that kind of went to go make an ass out of me, it actually showed off that you can sing, girl.
And I know you've seen that.
I know one of your other cornerstone songs is What's Going On by Four Non-Blondes or What's Up by Four Non-Blondes.
And there was Pat Benatar's song you always used to sing too, right?
Hit Me With Your Best Shot.
That's right, Hit Me With Your Best Shot.
Whip Me With Your Big Cock.
Sometimes, depending on how drunk she was, she might get up on stage.
I remember a certain occasion.
Well, it was a gay bar.
I remember a certain occasion, though, at Great America with someone recording Stay.
Yeah, that too.
And then me doing Like a Prayer, which I foolishly let Travis even touch that CD.
Anyhow.
You should never, ever, ever let Travis have access to anything that you think might... I seem to remember also a certain Carriac Revolution incident with the two of you.
Mm-hmm.
And that was when I discovered that this could really belt it out.
I was stunned.
Yeah.
But you're still doing the vocal thing, right?
I know we said for years, like, Jess, you should go try out for American Idol.
You should go try out for American Idol.
Well, now you can't try out for American Idol because... I'm too old.
You're too old, as we all are.
But there's this new show where age doesn't matter, The Voice, right?
And have you been watching the show?
You're really into it?
I am very, very much into it.
I heard about it after the first episode, caught up with it online, and fell in love with it instantly.
Because the entire concept of The Voice is that you are just a voice.
DarkSakura.com
And by the way, yes, this does relate to video games because this show is so huge.
There will be a video game based on it in six months.
I guarantee it.
Oh, I'm sure.
I guarantee it.
So then now we have a new question.
When are you going to try out for The Voice?
August 24th in San Francisco.
Wow, so you're doing it.
I'm actually doing it, yeah.
Oh my god.
There's a full campaign going right now.
I have a Facebook page, which goes by my... Here you go, big moment.
On your ninth anniversary show, I'm going to reveal my real last name because... Oh, even I'm not going to do that.
Because, unfortunately, there's no other way for me And I couldn't just put myself as Jessica Harper Because I think Jessica Harper would get pretty pissed off So, Jessica Friesen If you go to Facebook.com slash Jess Sings How many S's is that?
J-E-S-S?
Okay, S-I-N-G-S, okay
Rob is not the cunning linguist.
So you can go ahead and check out my stuff.
I actually have
things on there also on ReverbNation.com slash Jessica Friesen that has not only the version of Stay that Jamie had mentioned earlier as well as the video of Rob and I doing that infamous love shack now keep in mind again the video it was from VHS and it is 11 years old
Before we had DVD.
Yeah, the years have not been nice to the recording, but you still get the hint.
And then there's also two recordings in there that are from when I was briefly with the band as well.
So vocals, lyrics that were written by me and obviously sung by me.
DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind, would you post the link in chat?
And chatters, if you wouldn't mind, let's help Jess out with some likes and get her on The Voice.
Because then when she wins, we can say it all started here.
Yeah, and that ReverbNation page, the ReverbNation.com slash Jessica Friesen, that actually is what I gave to the people at The Voice as my page.
Nice.
As my music page.
So I had to have examples of my music and the more likes that I can get on there, the better off I am.
and I'm already up in the 50-ish people now so if I can boost that up a little more.
Alright, let's do it.
Good luck to you.
Let us know how that goes.
Sometimes, I don't even know what to expect from those auditions but you know there's going to be thousands of people there so if nothing else, go for the experience and have a blast.
That's my whole intention.
I don't even expect anything to happen but at least if I get out there and do it I can say that I tried.
I at least gave it my best effort.
Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, if Jessica makes it big on American Idol, I hope she will remember all those who knew her on OLR.
Well, I can guarantee you that won't be happening because she's trying out for The Voice.
Wrong show!
Anyhow, Salacious Pop has some karaoke requests for Jess and Rob.
Oh, really?
Yes, some karaoke requests for Jessica and Rob.
Let's see here.
Close to you by The Carpenters.
No, I know what I want.
Alone.
I actually used to do it.
Part of my problem with Alone is that I am no longer the soprano that I used to be, but you catch me with enough alcohol in my system, you might make that happen.
Love Will Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille And lastly, Don't Go Breaking My Heart by Elton John and RuPaul You know what, they need to shut up because I have a Captain and Tennille song on my iTunes, thank you, I have Muskrat Love I could possibly get them to take it down a couple of notes If I can get that highest note just a little bit further down Did you happen to watch American Idol when Carly Smithson was on?
We'll get back to video games at some point.
Because she did Jesus Christ Superstar, but her voice isn't that high.
So she actually harmonized, actually did a counter melody part and got away with it.
I love it.
Our buddy Travis is in chat, or DJ Morpheus is in chat, and in response to the whole Jessica saying we can say it's all started here on OLR, DJ Morpheus says, no she won't.
She'll be wearing a USL shirt when she's on TV.
If she doesn't, she's fired.
And technically, you know, the entire thing did start over there because I did officially announce it over there.
I know.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
But all of you guys, you know, you could still, you know, I'll be all right.
I embarrass the shit out of myself with that bitch 11 years ago.
Exactly.
You just write on 52 to 58 in the last five seconds.
Awesome.
Thank you, guys.
So there you go.
It may come in here worth it.
No, appreciate having you here.
Now if only I could get that kind of response over on USL, you know?
Hey, you guys should listen to USL right now.
Oh, wait.
Now that there's podcasts to listen to, that might happen.
I know, go listen.
Go start downloading right now.
Late breaking news as we get into part B tonight.
We're going to get into some video game news.
But Loki, you were mentioning some late breaking news just before we went live tonight.
And this has to do with music games.
This is so big.
I don't know how we didn't have it in the show before the news even came out.
Ubisoft has announced their next big music franchise.
That's right.
And you gotta wonder, how the fuck are they gonna follow up Michael Jackson?
I mean, Michael Jackson, the king of pop, one of the greatest pop icons.
On the anniversary of his death, nonetheless.
I can't even say that.
That will be coming out to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii soon.
Ah, I see.
So what would the Black Eyed Peas experience consist of?
Just a bunch of shitty sampling?
Yeah.
I got a feelin' that this game's gonna suck my ballsack I have to repeat this.
What?
Tiger Claw said the only way to get Jessica back on OLR would be to have us contact her agent.
I know, right?
Next year it'll be Jessica the experience, but that would be better than the Black Eyed Peas experience, that's for sure.
Is anyone excited about the Black Eyed Peas experience?
No.
I'm sorry, I completely was ignoring all of that.
I'm sorry, they're jacking my style.
Although I did see the best headline ever.
Can I share this with you guys?
Hold on, I put it on my Tumblr.
I don't talk about my Tumblr a lot because it makes me feel very hipster.
But it's my favorite thing that I've posted on Tumblr.
Are you drinking PBR?
In like a week.
I think you're okay then.
Here's the picture.
It's a headline in a tabloid.
It says, Fergie isn't pregnant, just really likes tacos.
What?
Now that's an experience I can get done with.
Rob, I'm reposting that right now.
That's what Tumblr's all about.
I reposted it from Alan.
Let me post that.
Can I post that?
How do I post that in chat?
You just copy... Copy link location.
Yeah.
There you go.
There you go.
Hooked on internet worked for him.
I think I might have put an extra slash at the end there.
Try that.
All right.
Salacious pop in our chat room.
What the hell did... There will be no tumbling during the show.
Stop.
Will you post that in chat?
I officially adore your boyfriend.
It's like a little mermaid.
It's a little mermaid meets Cyrano.
A whole new nose.
Well, speaking of salacious pop in our chat room, he's reacting to the Black Eyed Peas experience news saying, OMG, I'm like Regina George when she spit out the Calteen bar and screeched in Mean Girls.
Anyhow.
Hey, we have spinoff shows.
Like, I imagine you love Orange Lounge Radio so much you want to listen to some other shows.
I mean, we've plugged the shit out of Under Sedation Live, certainly.
But DarkSakura and I do some other shows, too, we want you to know about.
DarkSakura?
I do a podcast about comics where we don't really talk about comics that much anymore.
Because guess what?
The comic industry is lame right now.
But it's me and Tiara as Marvin Marvel.
I almost said Marvin Marvel.
Marvin Moral I'm going to blow you up.
My space monsterly tour.
I am Marvin the Marvel.
No, I almost said Marvin Moral.
And that just brings me straight to... Four!
Inside jokes for the win.
Marvin Marvel.
and Dan Shadow and we should have a new one up on Tuesday we are at Infamous.net N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net and we want email eventually people email us please because I don't have to read them Tiara has to read them make her read them make Tiara read your emails and also we have Twitter it's Comic Insanity the letter N not an I-N on Twitter
If you like the world of Warcraft and you want to hear a show more obscene than this one, check out the best little horde house in Azeroth.
Hordehouse.com This week's show, we had our buddy Syl, who is from, she was originally from Amsterdam, but she now lives in Britain.
Not the London part.
She lives in not London, we call it.
And tonight, or not tonight, but this week we got her to talk about ERP.
And an ERP story that will shock you.
So, yep, we're going to get in all that on Horde House.
HordeHouse.com.
ERP.
It's awesome.
Also?
What?
There will be more stuff coming.
More podcasts.
More podcasts.
You and your crypto stuff, foe.
Well, you're in on it.
I know.
You're helping out.
Shit.
I disavow all knowledge.
Yeah, can we just skip the Dwarven hand cannons, please?
And DJ Morpheus, always there to remind me in a who's your daddy kind of way.
Rob, Understation Live is not a spinoff.
It's your father, bitch.
That's why we didn't plug it just then.
Oh.
He just wants you to get off his lawn.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on.
Waving his cane at you.
Music Games Rock Band
and Rock Band getting some new download content in the form of Poison Pack 1 and featuring three songs by Poison including Nothing But A Good Time, Talk Dirty To Me, and Unskinny Bop and that's going to be $2 each or 160 Microsoft points or $5.49 for the whole pack or 440 Microsoft points.
Where is my Every Rose Has A Thorn?
Sorry, that's not in there.
And then also, of course, Three Doors Down, there's going to be a pack for them with the songs Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and When You're Young.
Each of those $2 and $5.49 for the whole pack.
And then, of course, if that's not exactly your taste, you may check out the Rock Band Network where there's been a pretty neat addition.
They added Pac-Man Fever.
Among a bunch of other tracks Pac-Man Fever I was going to say, just a really quick side note It's funny you mentioned Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Jamie That was my first slow dance ever Really?
In 8th grade But guess what?
It's not just Pac-Man Fever Because the Buckner and Garcia's also have Mousetrap, Hyperspace, and Froggy's Lament On the Rock Band Network Each of those two bucks But not doing the Donkey Kong I'm sorry
and let's see here.
Other than Rock Band, some stuff coming to L.A.
Noire or I should say L.A.
Noire is coming to PCs this fall.
They're going to be doing kind of the Rockstar thing, improving the graphics a little bit and adding 3D support as well.
That will be coming out this fall and I guess this fall is when I expect that we can hack the crap out of that because usually it takes the PC version to be able to break it open on both console and PC.
7 days!
It's 20 days actually earlier this week.
So it will be running I guess from now through July 28th and you can check it out on Xbox Live Marketplace or the PlayStation Network and also kind of going with that if you're in the Japanese region or
Have a jailbroken phone or device.
You can check out the iOS app that's available through the Japanese App Store.
And it includes Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 and a minigame called Sonic the Sketch Hog.
As well as news feed and weekly wallpaper downloads.
I got distracted.
Fucking Tumblr, I swear to God.
What?
No, Tumblr is banned during the show.
This is the best one ever, though.
Just look at Alan's Tumblr.
He posts the craziest shit.
Today I will get shit done by visiting LOLNope Tumblr.
Alright, moving on.
I'll show the chatroom.
Hey, this is serious news, you guys.
Yu Suzuki has revealed in a Gamasutra interview he is leaving his management position at AM2, which is part of his company that develops games.
He will be at Sega as an advisor.
But he will be kind of leaving his more management roles.
So there you go.
Do you see this?
Dan and Yu Suzuki.
So how does that make you feel as such a Yu Suzuki fan?
This was E3 like seven years ago.
He looks so young.
Are you sad or are you just like, oh, well, you know, these things happen.
As long as he's still, as long as his great influence will still be upon Sega.
Yeah.
Saga will never really die.
Well, in more news you can file next to, duh, and of course, PopCap, who, in an unrelated story, has, I guess, rumors going around that somebody wants to buy PopCap for $1 billion.
Please don't be Activision.
PopCap might be sold for $1 billion.
That actually isn't the story I was going to say.
Duh, and of course, Bejeweled 3 is coming to consoles.
Hey, Rob.
What?
You know who's rumored to be buying PopCap, right?
I heard it was EA.
Zynga.
Oh, God.
Barf.
Speaking of Sega and Zynga, I was driving home from San Francisco last night, and as I got on the freeway, I drove by the old Sega building that now has the Zynga logo on it.
I cried.
Bejeweled 3 on the DS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in the last quarter of 2011.
Of course, you know that Bejeweled 3 is coming.
And one of these games, you better get it or else it's going to be gone.
And this was kind of a big one.
TMNT...
That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the hipsters
But if you want to get Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Reshelled, which was the arcade game but kind of redone graphics and so forth, get it now or never get it.
Those are your choices.
DarkSakura has got some rapid fire news for us.
We'll get to the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
Well, this should make a lot of fanboys need new panties.
New Dragon Age 2 download content is going to be available.
Five achievements.
There's actually no price on it quite yet, but the achievements will be for a total of 120 points.
That is Conductor, Defeat, and Ancient Evil in the Vimark Mountains Deeproot Safari, Kill, a bunch of stuff Family Legacy, Apply Three Effects to Hawk's Key Family Outing, that's the main quest in Vimark Mountains with Bethany or Carver and the party And Townsweep, you know, actually I got Carver killed and didn't really give a shit about Bethany And Tower Sweeper, where you do every side quest in the Vimark Mountain prison tower
Then, there's actually a public monument being made to Gary Gygax, who is one of the creators of D&D.
And it is in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
It better be a huge mungus D20.
And it better be a natural 20.
It better be a 12-sider because, dude, it's all about playing Warrior Class.
I'm kidding, I played Ages.
And last but never least, more WiiU news.
WiiU, WiiU, WiiU, WiiU.
Every single time somebody says that, I always hear in my head the chick from Kung Pao.
Of course.
Anyway, Masahiro Sakurai is basically quoted as saying that another Smash Brothers game is years away for Wii U and 3DS.
They're putting all of their effort into Kid Icarus Uprising.
And he said that it makes him cringe that he's got more projects on his plate.
What makes him cringe?
The fact that they're announcing games five years before they're coming out?
Is that the part that makes him cringe?
The fact that he's, I don't know, just putting his credibility on the line?
Hey, by the way, we're going to have a new Mario game.
Mario's going to come out and be alive in your house.
Oh, that's not coming out for 50 years, though.
To attract new team members.
apparently they need work well there's people over here who don't have jobs who can design pretty well and I'll design your manual for you if you pay me a lot I would think that they would be able to put that up on like I don't know a job posting or something like that instead of saying hey fans of hey guess what fans of Smash Brothers there's a game coming would you rather have someone working on a project that actually cares about the project or someone who's just worried about throwing out crap
Well, I would rather they care about it, but also rather they, I don't know, don't announce it before you have even started the game.
It's an inevitability anyway.
I was about to say the same thing.
I was thinking more in the vein of inevitability.
New Nintendo console, yeah, of course, we're going to put our new Smash Brothers, but we'll do it later.
Hypothetical games that are going to be coming out then.
I mean, since they're out there.
Microsoft did it too.
They announced Alan Wake with the 360 five years later.
Okay, but it was probably in development.
It wasn't something that they said, eh, well, you know, there's a difference between delay, delay, delay and a difference between...
Yeah, well, we haven't really started the game yet.
So we wrote it down on a piece of paper.
You know we're going to.
Hey, wouldn't you guys like a Smash Bros.
game on the 3DS?
We would too!
So that's why we're going to work on one someday.
That's what Nintendo was announcing at E3.
Shit that they don't even have started yet.
They're probably on the drive-in or walking up on the... Hey, you know what?
We should tell them that there's a new Smash Bros.
coming out.
Yeah.
Alright, let's get to some Twitter topics.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Tweet, tweet, tweet.
Every week.
We need you here every week just for that part.
Who sends us a tweet that's a retweet from Agent M Behold, the 25th anniversary DVD collection of the Golden Girls And we get linked to a post on Yes Tumblr Which is, I guess, this Golden Girls collection that comes in a gigantic purse Awesome It's all seven seasons on DVD with a deck of playing cards as well
It better come with a gift certificate to Cheesecake Factory.
When's that coming out?
Soon?
I don't know.
I didn't see the date.
I would think that Applebee's would be more appropriate.
But I loved Flaming Toilet's comment.
Now if we could just get them to include an official game in that box set.
I'm hoping.
And don't forget about maybe having the first season of Golden Palace.
Do you remember that?
Oh, they linked it to Amazon.
Oh, gee.
The low, low price of $182.
Jeez.
Let's see.
When is it out?
That is still cheaper than Deep Space Nine, for the record.
It's out.
I don't know.
That's a lot of Betty White.
It's out now.
In stock.
Buy it now.
It's my birthday, just saying.
All right.
Moving on.
Let's see.
Going to S2100 Matt.
A guy is shipping himself 2,000 plus miles in a crate while playing Lord of the Rings online.
Surprisingly for a good cause, too.
This might be relevant to Jessica's interests.
We were just talking earlier about shipping Drunami in a crate.
There he is.
He's in a crate playing on a PC there.
That is not comfortable looking.
What's his name?
Performance artist Jordan Wayne Long.
Starting on July 7th, he will be confined to a small wooden box.
He's being shipped from Bald Knob, Arkansas.
What?
And we're back to the penis joke.
Ian all alone in that box.
He's going to have a bald knob by the time he's done.
Well, you know, there's only so much you can do.
But it is summer festival.
You're going to get bored of Lord of the Rings Online eventually.
A man's got needs.
Bald knob Arkansas to Portland, Oregon.
Picture him finding some cute little elf.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to find which port to put his bald nod in Why the fuck is he doing it?
The reasons apparently are mixed He wants to provide entertainment through his Twitter account He also aims to better understand post-traumatic stress disorder Many individuals who experience traumatic events What, is this a joke?
Are you going to tell me this is a hoax?
No, no, it's not a hoax.
Here's why he's doing it.
Attention whore is why he's doing it because he's a poor artist.
I'm doing an art project where I'm going to ship myself in a container and play Lord of the Rings.
It worked.
How is being in a shipping container while having entertainment and, you know, at least you have one luxury.
How is that causing PTSD?
and any way, shape, or form.
How are you going to have post-traumatic stress disorder?
He's playing Lord of the Rings online.
If you want to get PTSD, why don't you play Black Eyed Peas, The Experience?
I don't get this.
I hope they put him in one of those shipping containers up in the airplanes where they have no oxygen and sub-zero freezing temperatures and he freezes to death.
That's what I hope happens to this guy.
He freezes to death!
I wish him death by freezing!
Now if that does happen, you're going to feel a little bad.
No, I'm not.
I'm going to laugh.
I'm going to laugh.
I'm on the record right now saying I will laugh my ass off for at least five minutes.
I hate to break it to you, but I don't think there's any major airports in Bald Knob.
If there was.
Yes, there is.
Bald Knob International.
I don't think anybody could ever take it seriously if they had to take a flight through there.
They have flights every day to Toronto and Guadalajara.
The views expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those of all the staff of Orange Lounge Radio Right
No, Frisbee says that can't be more than a four to five hour flight.
Dude, he's shipping himself UPS.
That's the problem.
That's why it's going to take seven days.
He's going to get lost, dumped in the ocean, you know.
And then they'll leave him on some back porch somewhere.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
So why is he able to ship himself via, you know, UPS?
Because I'm pretty sure they have policies against him.
I actually made that up.
I don't know how he's shipping himself, but I just assumed it was UPS.
Old Dominion.
That's what I hope they're shipping him because they will lose that package.
Alright, Tigerclaw links us to some stories here real quick Remember Geohot?
That's right, the man behind the Sony Playstation debacle when Sony was going to sue him Probably the whole reason why Sony got hacked a couple months ago Apparently, he's come out of this okay He's got a development gig now at Facebook
Gameplay Theater Festival Gameplay Theater Festival
Speaking of performance art, here we go.
It combines gaming and performance art.
If you're in Brooklyn, oh God, haven't these guys done this shit before?
I remember a Brooklyn theater and something about gaming.
But the Brick Theater is going to be doing gameplay.
It's a theater festival comprised of gaming-oriented stage productions, musical performances, and interactive performance art.
Let's see.
There's Romeo and Julietette It's a modern interpretation of Shakespeare's classic It will be performed entirely within World of Warcraft Modal Combat uses real guitars to control Mortal Kombat characters There's a YouTube I could play it Why don't they actually do a good Shakespeare play?
Or I could go to the last tweet tonight from Actdeft.
Here's a good question.
A question for our nine year anniversary show.
I like this.
What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?
What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?
I'll start with Loki.
He's opinionated.
I don't know.
Come back to me.
I'll think about this.
DarkSakura?
Nothing's really surprising.
You know
It's, anything that's exciting is cyclic.
Because there are always, it's always going to be, I read them on E3, all this stuff, blah, blah, blah.
And then all of this, blah, blah, blah.
So it really is going to go in a cycle.
It's nothing stays really crazy.
I guess the monumental news of the whole nine years is that I like WoW now.
Um, the most impactful news of the past.
Well, let me go to the guests first before I say my opinion.
Anybody?
Do you know me?
No?
Jess Carper passing?
I don't know.
Anything you guys can think of?
I'm going to go along with Jamie's line of thinking of, oh my goodness, I'm actually playing an MMO.
Which for anybody who knows me is pretty shocking.
Maybe the advent of the MMO, if you will, over the past nine years.
I mean, granted, Ultima Online is a little bit over nine years old, but maybe the mainstreaming of the MMO.
It would definitely be in the top five, I think, for me.
It really did.
And I've said so on the show before, but I've used to play Gemstone back in the day when it was on AOL.
And you had to pay to play Gemstone when you had to pay to do AOL by the hour.
When I first started into tech support and the whole IT world, I was surrounded by guys who were playing EverQuest.
So that was all I ever heard about was EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest.
And it was because of them that I swore off any kind of MMO ever.
And here I am, many, many, many, many years later, and I'm addicted to Lotro.
So, I don't know.
for me the most impacting Xbox Live is the biggest story I think that's happened in nine years I don't think people took the Xbox particularly seriously until Xbox Live changed console gaming and not only changed console gaming it killed arcades
and it changed the way we commune as a community and it's been imitated by other places I think Xbox Live it's part of the reason we have DarkSakura's favorite word microtransactions now is because of Xbox Live Xbox Live I think is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years I'm still thinking just the whole really pushing the internet too How long do you think it'll actually be before they just give up on the concept of arcades altogether?
I don't think they ever will because the ticket gambling things will always be there.
And I think there will always be a pinball machine in a bar.
At the same time though, just while I was going through Roseville Golf Land, I always make notes when I see new Ticket Redemption games as well.
And there were only one or two.
It seems like even those are starting to slow down a little bit.
However, Pachinko in Japan is still big.
The most surprising for me is kind of a tie.
I would say the Nintendo Wii.
Just the fact that Nintendo did it.
They had a vision and they were right and love them or hate them for it, they did it.
and the rise of Facebook games I think is very surprising.
Farmville might be the most surprising thing of the past nine years.
Again, love it or hate it, your grandma's playing it.
I have to go with the fact that Nintendo had this neat system that they developed called the Revolution and then last month they thought, hey, you know what's a better name?
Wii.
And also Giant Enemy Crabs.
Some of the chatters disagree with me.
I can't see how Xbox Live killed arcade gaming.
Because you didn't have to leave the house to go be with other people.
That's why I say that.
I mean, granted, it's one of several things that probably led to that.
But I think it made that whole community gaming.
You didn't have to really leave the house to do it.
And that goes right hand in hand with the whole internet MMO thing.
I think those are closely married together.
Just thinking back to the way things used to be, the arcade used to be a place that people would go to hang out.
Even before when we were actively playing as a group at Roseville Golf Land and what have you back in the day.
Earlier than that, people were... At Birdcage Center, this is a place that we used to have our Rocky at.
God, the arcade there was epic.
It was one of the best arcades.
And it was the thing to do.
You would hang out and you would either go to the bowling alley, to the movies, or you would be hanging out in the arcade.
And it was the social...
basically the social mecca of that entire area so I think that essentially the internet and all of the MMOs, Xbox Live all of that has really really led to the decline I mean it's nice to on a whim go to the arcade with your friends but it's not some place you're going to be spending every single night like we were back in our DDR days it just doesn't happen yeah
And again, folks in the chatroom still disagreeing with me over Xbox Live killing arcade games.
I'll give you that concession.
It didn't single-handedly do it, but I still stand by my answer.
Xbox Live's the most important thing that happened in gaming in the past nine years.
And again, the Xbox would have failed without it.
People did not take the Xbox seriously until you played Halo 2 online for the first time.
I mean, there was...
of course some people bought the system but it did not take off until Xbox Live I think that really actually started I think from the Dreamcast because a lot more online games for a console came out with the Dreamcast we had Phantasy Star Online in Japan which didn't support their broadband adapter over here which was shitty Quake 3 so many games started coming out toward the end of the Dreamcast life that used the online support
But Xbox Live centralized it Exactly, see that's what I'm saying The concept was there Sega was starting to push it Xbox didn't invent it, they just perfected it Microsoft's way of gaming They don't think of it always They just perfect it But in Japan they had the Satellaview for Super Nintendo Where you could play Online games And what was the thing called for the Genesis The X Something
Saga Channel
Yeah, I think Blackwolf sums it up pretty well.
It didn't catch on with the Dreamcast, and it didn't catch on with Sega Channel.
I mean, it was a great idea, but it didn't catch on.
It needed Microsoft for the marketing.
And, you know, that centralization, I think, is, again, the key word there, too.
All right, let's move on past the Twitter topics.
Let's get into some more gaming news.
We have some more stories for you guys.
FUs of the Week coming up as well.
At some point, we'll have a mailbag, too.
And then, of course, the calls, the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But not just yet.
First some stories, Loki
Sony Online Entertainment Platform Engineer claims that Sony technicians only installed firewalls on an ad hoc basis after they determined that a particular user was attempting to gain unauthorized access to the network.
and says also that I guess Sony spent lavishly on security measures for its own PlayStation dev network and didn't put the same effort or budget into securing users' data because they only seem to care about themselves.
And also I guess that they enacted large-scale layoffs in March of this year just weeks before the massive data breach.
Hmm, that's a little coinkydink.
Yeah, so there's a whole lot of not nice things that are going on there.
I'm making Rob laugh.
Tarzira's teaching me sign language.
I thought I was going to say Nolan Kerr.
Well, what do you think, though?
Is this really to blame for why PlayStation Network went down?
I don't know.
I think just people really want to kick Sony while they're down, and this just seems a little bit like... Well, I mean, if they're spending a lot of money and time to secure their other network that has stuff that's important to Sony, but yet the stuff that's important to their consumers, like, I don't know, their personal information, they just leave wide open, then, yeah, that does sound like a problem to me.
I think at the end of the day, you know what I always say on this show, a hacker's going to hack.
And I think after everybody was very angered by the removal of Linux, I don't even think if they could have had the higher security facility in the world, they probably still would have found a way to get in there and hack it.
I don't know.
Not that it makes it right.
Sony had every enemy in the world at that point.
But then that's also like saying, well, I left my doors unlocked in my house, so that's why I got robbed.
Thank you for watching!
Put out a bunch of what-if scenarios out there for a whole bunch of things that they could have done, but they didn't do any of them, so we don't really need to.
Stupidity in terms of security aside, you still don't blame the victim.
You can't say, oh, well, it's just, you know, why secure banks?
Bank robbers are going to rob banks.
I mean, that's dumb.
Yeah.
All right, well, let's move on.
Well, apparently, there is this whole, I guess, thing going around that there's a better for Kinect, I guess, thing going on with the new Halo game.
And Microsoft Studios' Phil Spencer, who's the boss there, mentioned with GameSpot, As a first party, we believe that Kinect will be important to all genres of games.
Even games like Halo Anniversary has Kinect integration.
So you can say, CONFIRMED!
Connect integration with Halo Anniversary but it may not be what you think there was a forum admin BS Angel, I like that name on the Halo Waypoint forums one of the admins said about Halo Anniversary's Connect integration just to let everybody know the Connect features we're exploring with Halo Anniversary are optional and won't affect your core gameplay experience our mission from day one has been to deliver a faithful recreation of the original game and we remain dedicated to seeing that through to completion
FaceMapping FaceMapping
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, but I don't see a Halo map editor happening, period.
But it just occurred to me that it would actually be, because you say move tree here.
They could do that because of Forge.
Remember Forge is part of the region.
Or you could just go play Minecraft.
I had a nightmare about Minecraft.
You had a nightmare about Minecraft?
I sure did.
Did the goblins get through to your house or any of that stuff?
The goblins all had internet troll faces.
I'm not even joking.
PenisMan in our chatroom says, I don't care if they add connect to Halo as long as I can play it with just a controller as the Halo lover I am.
There you go.
And BlackWolf says, face mapping under your helmet.
Ah, it's technology so good you can't even tell it's there.
Anyhow, also real quick about Halo, there is flaming helmets coming to Halo Reach.
That's right, if you register on Bungie.net or through the recently released iOS app, you have until the end of July 7th to get a flaming Bungie head-on-fire blue flame thing for Halo Reach.
You can get that, and there's this cute little PSA they made about it from, of course, Red vs. Blue.
So guess what, Jessica?
I can play Halo and be flaming!
Hello, I'm flaming.
I'm playing Halo.
It's fabulous.
DarkSakura, you have some news for us?
I have mail.
I've got news.
You have mail.
Excuse me.
Burn the mail.
Okay.
We got some birthday wishes in the mailbag.
Bit.Trip Saga and Bit.Trip Complete are being done on the 3DS and Wii and will be out on the 13th of September in the US.
But there's no European publisher yet.
Sadness.
We'll have it here, so everybody in Europe, import it.
Alright, before we get to some more news... Oh look, it's the Mailbag music!
It must be time.
Dang it, I almost closed everything, my bad.
I don't think so.
Every week you guys send us emails, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and sometimes I remember to put it on the show roll.
Because this is a show where every gamer has a voice, usually.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I know why you didn't do it, because last week you read it and you thought that I might have laryngitis again this week.
Well, guess what?
I did it out of consideration for you.
Yeah, well, this is from Robba.
Here's one of the few stories that link games with less violence and crime.
My take on this is, this is just a theory, not scientific study.
The only difference is they can compare video game proliferation against the crime rates dropping by year, which is more objective data than the games cause violence wingnuts, which only seem to use hand-picked data from poorly designed experiments.
And this actually comes from BBC, which, honestly, world news from BBC is probably one of the best sources to get it from.
It's the BBC.
Well, keep in mind, you want your dry news, you get it from BBC.
Without any of the, you know, sensationalism.
Tonight on the BBC, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.
But I've covered this on the show before.
I think I'm coming.
Oh, oh.
Oh, dear.
Isn't it nice to have a penis?
Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?
In 19... Okay, it says 1985, crack market recruits youngest sellers, and it's a relatively low rate then.
1991, peak murder rate, crack demand starts to fall.
And it...
It is actually, as of right now, the crime rate is lower for murder, that is, than it was in 1970.
It hit its peak in, I think, around 1991, 1992.
And that robbery rates are also just slightly higher than murder rates, but still far low what they were in 1970.
And that's coming from the FBI.
You know what that means, though, Rob.
On Wall Street, you're hearing...
Silk Crack, Silk Crack, Silk Crack, Silk Crack.
I'm posting a link to this in the chat room.
But I've covered that on the station before because there was actually someone who did an independent study using a number of different resources including the FBI and various local police accounts that came to the same conclusion.
Guess what came out in 1991?
The NES, I do believe, in the United States.
In 91?
No, the Super Nintendo.
Super Nintendo.
Unfortunately, crack will be on the rise again and it's all thanks to video games.
Thanks to a new video game that's going to be coming out this holiday season.
It's called Being Bobby Brown.
Let's take a look at a clip.
I've been to jail before.
That's American.
Kiss my ass!
You kiss my ass?
Kiss my ass!
Fucking love that.
Bobby!
Whitney Houston, the experience coming out.
Where's my drugs?
I'll tell you what, Whitney Houston, the experience would be better than Black Eyed Peas, the experience.
I'm sorry.
There's something to experience there, that's for sure.
Well, anyway, they're attributing some of this to the Obama effect, meaning that they're saying that having a black president is a better role model.
Where's my Kurt Cobain experience?
And then there's a fall in demand for crack.
Be a short game.
Obama being president means there's less of a demand for crack.
I'm going number by number.
Smarter policing.
Better tracking of numbers so that they can actually keep the flow of criminality down Increased availability of legal abortion
and more criminals behind bars.
Reducing of lead in gasoline is decreasing exposure to children, which is also contributing to a fallen violent crime.
The baby boomers grew up.
Okay, now this is it.
This is the important one.
Number nine, a study released last month suggested video games were keeping young people off the streets and therefore away from crime.
Researchers in Texas working with the Center for European Economic Research said this...
and Incapacitation Effect more than offset any direct impact the contents of games may have had in encouraging violent behavior.
So what you're saying is then they're just too fat to go outside and kill each other?
Pretty much.
Too lazy.
Nah.
It's more of that... I can kill you, but I'm feeling really high.
And also, the last one on there, and actually I like this one, the proliferation of camera phones.
Meaning, oop, someone's robbing the ATM.
Snap.
Just saying.
Next email.
Hey, it's pretty valid.
At least it's better supported than all those other... Yet at the same time, the amateur porn market is thriving due to camera phones.
Okay, this comes from Holly.
Has there been anything on Microsoft's next console?
Do you think they are just keeping it under wraps or that maybe they haven't made anything this time around?
Under wraps.
Maybe.
I'd be kind of interested in seeing a portable from Microsoft.
With the DS, things have been coming out lately.
I'm just not feeling Nintendo anymore.
Nintendo seems to be focusing way too much on gimmicky things and way less on quality of games.
No, not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm posing for a picture for Drew.
My husband and I both recently got rid of our DS lights and all the games.
He had just bought the new Pokemon game but got bored with it after a week since it's pretty much the same game all over again.
Actually, we also gave away our Wii to my mom as well.
She's using it to watch Netflix.
But when our Xbox died, we freaked and ran immediately by another one.
It's already red-ringed once, didn't know if they'll cover it a second time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Why would you buy an Xbox today with Kinect if you know something better is coming out next year?
It just gives people incentive to wait.
So I'm going to say that's your number one reason.
And it's not, to be honest, that's not specific to Xbox.
PlayStation 4 has been in development for years.
I guarantee it.
You're just not going to hear about it for a little while because they don't want to cannibalize the PlayStation 3.
Such is how the game industry works.
Good lord, people.
Okay.
Hey, OLR crew!
ACHP here with congratulations and salutations for another year of OLR.
I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate your birthday and your roots than an addition of, where are they now, Bay Area DDR players.
Fanamei-kun was, a few weeks ago, Milton Maple and Gary, who was Shintenji.
Wendell is a trooper and ran Stage Zero day and night to keep folks in the convention center entertained.
Speaking of Stage Zero, the DS players, a dance crew formed mostly of old DVR freestylers, took the stage and blew everyone away.
No longer satisfied to dance on panels in time...
on panels in time to era's likes of AJ Sweet Banana, John Chaos, James Captain Canada, Lawrence Fuzzy Hat, and many more cosplayed as random, completely not anime-related characters like Jesus, Jackie Chan, The Terminator, and Tigger while popping, locking, and breakdancing to the tunes of 8-bit remixes and old-school funk.
They put on an amazing show, and they inspire me to become a better dancer.
there was still stepping on arrows to be had as Jonas Explicit who's been on the show quite a few times who now runs the Big Anime Game Room or T-Bagger for short at most Bay Area conventions, hosted a DDR freestyle tournament to try and relive the good old days
To prove that freestyle is dead, no one cared if you failed or even hit the arrows because no one here remembers how to dance and step on arrows at the same time.
Sad face.
Bruce Leroy showed up and brought it back old school, but Chaos One was some excellent locking.
Mel B and Rain provided some sweet tunes at the Faname Rave and were the only two DJs who played music that anyone can dance to.
I won't get into how I feel about anime con rave music here, but suffice to say that Mel B and Rain are following their passion of music.
By the way, if you're really lost right now, these are all people that were very much like win, place, and show in the DDR tournaments of our day.
So if you didn't follow that scene, you're a little lost right now.
And I'm pretty sure that Hattori Hanzo was also part of the rave crew as well.
Yes.
But, I want to say, for those that were, this is a great email.
Let's lose people further with a resounding, Hi guys!
Shut up.
I'm actually totally... I wanted to go to Faname this year, but it didn't work out.
I'm going to Faname next year.
I don't care.
Finally, at Kentucky Con in Sacramento last weekend, I ran into Lil B, who showed up for a dance competition to win a $1,000 grand prize.
For those who don't know, Lil B started dancing seriously around four or five years ago.
From what I can hear from his sister, he dances all day and all night and wins dance competitions all over the Bay Area.
There was some fierce competition at Kentucky Con, but Lil B came out on top to claim the grand prize.
That man is still like five feet tall, but now he has transformed into a compact ball of pure energy that exists only to dance and win.
Also, I went to Svigel for the first time in about five years, and Corey Virtue was still there playing 2DX.
It's nice to know that some things never change in life.
Zing.
Except he's married now.
Can you believe that?
Didn't he, like, just walk by you randomly one day and go douche or something?
Uh, no, I think that was the other douche.
I don't know.
Or somebody else did that, and I was like, what?
Let's talk about happier subjects.
But he did the bag of flour.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Anyway, my brain, okay.
It's nice to know some things never change in life.
I hope you all enjoyed my edition of Where Are They Now?
The prevailing theme is that the freestylers are still dancing just without the aid of arrows and a dance pad.
Definitely check out the DS players on YouTube and we'll be locking as well.
The way I see it, if a bunch of anime nerds who liked a dancing video game become one of the best crews in the Bay Area, anyone can learn to dance.
Happy birthday, OLR, and I love you all.
Yours truly, AZHP.
Great email.
Yes.
Worth... For like 5% of the audience.
I need some lighter.
Awesome email.
For everybody in this room.
Yes, exactly.
Memories.
Okay.
Hi, all.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
First off, I want to thank you guys for giving me so many tips for a horror point and click game.
I started with Amnesia, The Dark Descent.
I've never been so scared in my life.
When my husband, who stood right behind me, said something to me, I shrieked and almost punched him in his manly hood.
I have two questions for all of you.
I'm going to dry.
Since I'm an MMO addict, what do you think of the upcoming MMO The Secret World?
I am hoping it will be really good, Hork, Cthulhu, etc.
But I do fear that it might not be as good in the end as I want it to be.
A bit why I got with Conan.
My second question, in these nine years of podcasting, what have you guys learned about yourselves in podcasting?
Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?
Lots of love, Syl.
P.S.
I'm still going to Ninja Dark Sakura for an interview on Girls Gone Wild.
I'm down for it.
Those are two completely different questions.
The Secret World, I don't know much about it, but I'm doing a little bit of reading on it, and it sounds like it's the folks that made Age of Conan, so it ties into that, and Anarchy Online.
It's being made for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, and there's no levels, no classes.
It's all skill-based, so you don't have to level grind, and I guess there's several side quests and all that type of stuff you know on MMO.
I don't know much about this game.
I don't think they showed it at E3 this year, or if they did, it was a little bit under the radar.
So I don't know enough about it to really comment on it.
I want a Total Call of Cthulhu MMO.
I hope it's better than the Conan MMOs.
Drew just said what I was thinking.
It's like, were you never going to get a character past level 5?
What was the second question?
The second question was something about podcasting itself, right?
What have you guys learned about yourselves and podcasting?
Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?
Oh, God.
I've learned that I have a high tolerance for bullshit now.
Not really.
I don't have a high tolerance for bullshit.
That's kind of a wide question considering how much the whole process of quote-unquote podcasting has changed over the last nine years as well.
That's true.
There was no podcasting when OLR started.
Yeah, there was no such thing as a podcast.
There was just broadcasting on Live 365 and boom, there you go.
Shoutcast server galore.
I will tell you one big thing that I've learned just from being a quote, public figure.
Because we get emails from complete strangers.
Mm-hmm.
That, when someone is saying that you need to go back to the kitchen And that you're bringing down the podcast It's sort of like, well they don't know shit about me I don't care, it was that point I was like, I don't really care, you know I can take whatever comes my way I've got a lot of people supporting me And really, those are the people that I'm doing this for Yeah, haters gonna hate Exactly, that was the big thing, haters gonna hate
and uh you know for every troll out there there's look look at the chat room people that are spending their sunday nights listening to some schmoes on the internet they could be in church i mean it's just that's that's why to be here but let me give you the number one piece of advice i could i could do a podcast on podcasting but let me let me give you the number one piece of advice
I quit.
Yeah.
But they were 12 people that were giving up their Sunday nights to come listen to what we had to say.
And it was like hanging out with your friends at dinner at Brookfields, Denny's, whatever the place is.
Some of us still podcast to 12 people.
Exactly.
But we love it.
And that's the whole purpose.
Because those are 12 badass people that you're having fun with.
So podcast because you like that sense of community no matter how big your community is.
I've made a lot of friends.
All over the world.
And they've sent us this.
You got porn.
It's in that box.
Do podcasting to get porn.
There's actually not that box, but that box over there still has some of the stuff.
uh and then uh the the honestly as far as like the actual production of a podcast quote unquote my my big thing be enthusiastic be and you don't have to be like oh my god you guys i'm so excited about games no like just be sound like you want to be doing a podcast what's that
Fabulous But no, for real, like, just I can't tell you how many podcasts I've heard where it's like Okay, so, welcome to episode number It's like listening to NPR Episode number five of GameCasts and we're gonna talk about video games Would you like fries with that?
You know, it's just like sound reasonably happy.
And I realize sometimes we're very harsh critics about video games here on the show, especially that guy sitting over there when it comes to Nintendo.
But don't mistake.
Don't talk to Drew like that.
Don't mistake enthusiasm.
Fuck you, buddy.
A lot of that is when I say enthusiasm, a lot of that is really passion.
Have a passion for what it is you're talking about.
Even if you're talking about nothing.
Or talking out your ass.
We rant and we rave because we actually give a damn.
Talking out of my ass?
What are you talking about?
And don't do what I used to do every few years and do nothing but read Harry Potter books during the podcast.
SST100 Matt in chat says, I don't even remember what I did on Sunday nights before OLR.
That's how long I've been listening to OLR.
Seven or eight years.
I remember what I did.
I slept.
I used to go to the goth club with Jessica.
Yeah, that's why I was never around on Sundays.
Funny enough.
Ironically, that goth club sucks now.
I know.
Well, I was just thinking about that two weeks ago because I heard about it in passing or something.
And I was just like, God, I haven't been there in nine years.
Yeah, it's still going.
But it sucks now.
It's all teeny boppers.
Baby bats.
Yeah.
Completely batlings.
I'm more goth than you.
Either that or I'll wear less clothing than you.
Did I tell you about me going to Bat's Day at Disneyland?
It was sad.
It was a bunch of little Hot Topic baby goths.
Except for this one chick who was wearing full black Victorian garb with the bustle and everything, pushing her baby in a lace-covered pram.
It was the most adorable thing.
I was like, okay, you're doing actual gothic.
Yeah.
I'm catching up on some of the chat comments from chat.orangelonsradio.com because I was busy chatting about that last email and I'm catching up with your chats.
And I want to say this and then we can maybe go on to the next email.
I love this comment from Dark Tetsuya in the chat room.
This is about the haters going to hate line that DarkSakura was talking about.
Yeah, really.
You've been doing the radio podcast thing for nine years.
What have they done with themselves in that time?
They just right on dig.
You know?
And that was the whole thing.
The moment that I saw the sort of misogynistic comments, I was like, it has nothing to do with any type of talent or anything that I said.
They're gonna be little, you know, dickless, you know...
Dickless Wonder Next email Okay, I'm actually replying to Syl I'm sending her my email Oh, Syl was the guest on Horde House and she was fabulous I'll reply to it later, but I'm sending Syl my regular email Oh, you girls gonna chat offline about pillow fights?
No, about me being on Girls Gone Wild Oh, okay, it's a fun show
She wants to go wild on Girls Gone Wild.
I'll ask you to take your top off.
For the record, for the record, my tune has already danced mostly naked in front of the Lich King.
Keep your ass out of Goldshire.
There's pictures of my team dancing naked in front of the Lich King.
Before you go on Girls Gone Wild, I need you to do some research.
I want you to roll a character on the Moonguard server, take off all your clothes, and run to Goldshire.
Just watch.
See, now you're giving me ideas.
Rob, you realize that when we get back from Pinkberry, that's the first thing I'm fucking doing.
I'll run straight from Archet to Bree, all the way to the Shire, completely naked.
Just saying.
Goddammit, guys, Moonguard used to be good.
Well, technically, they, um, they, uh, well, shoot, I'd have to get to Stormwind.
Is it from Stormwind to Goldshire?
Elwynn to Goldshire.
Elwynn to Goldshire?
Yep.
That's real human.
Next email.
Naked.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Dear OLR, I have nothing intelligent to say.
Okay, bye email.
Okay.
But as a long-time listener, I would like to wish you all a happy birthday and thank you for your dedication.
Running for almost a decade is an incredible achievement.
Sometimes I wonder how much an effect your show has had on me as I've grown up, considering I've been listening since I was 14 or so.
It's been a positive one, though.
I'm glad you think so.
I wonder what your parents think.
Please continue to do your show until the universe collapses in on itself or until at least the sun goes large enough to swallow the earth.
Elliot, the Afro guy.
Oh, God.
There's been a few people.
There was an iTunes review recently.
By the way, we love five-star reviews on iTunes.
And I gotta say, one of the most recent ones that's there is somebody that was literally saying, I grew up on your show.
And like, I...
I really can't wrap my head around that comment.
Like, I know it's a compliment and I'm very thankful about it, but I literally can't.
Rob.
What?
You grew up on this show.
No, think about it, okay?
When you first started, when we first went off back in 2000 to the Rocky Horror Convention, you were what, 22?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I still don't think you, sir, have grown up on this show.
It's true.
I can agree that for myself, because honestly, when you're in your 20s, you're still sort of in that teenage drama.
It's why I can't listen to the old episodes of OIL.
Everybody always asks, like, when are you going to post episode one?
It's not that I'm embarrassed of episode one.
I love episode one.
That's just not you anymore.
If I listen to it, I go...
That guy then, I want to punch him.
In the face.
You know, I feel the same way going back on my life journal.
Seriously.
You want clear-cut evidence how much I've grown.
Mr. Young Republican.
Seriously.
At least he's more of a young libertarian now.
At one point, this guy had hair longer than mine.
I got lazy.
It actually looks good on you.
I'm due for another haircut anyway.
But anyway, I think I can say safely that ever since all of this started, because I'll even go back to USL.
Because that's where I got, my start was guesting on USL a whole bunch too.
Oh, sure.
I mean, USL kind of, I will say, for all the shit I've given Travis over the years and all this, and he says, you know, sometimes I refuse to acknowledge the show or whatever, which, you know, isn't true.
I love Under Station Live, but let me say this about Under Station Live.
As Drew ceremoniously passes the mic back over to me.
It showed me that there is an audience.
There's an audience for tickling guys.
What the hell are you talking about?
Forgot about that one, didn't you, sir?
It definitely was the enabler because KCSC was one thing.
That was about trying to get into... I still have pictures from that, by the way.
That's when I thought I would be a radio DJ.
That would be my gig.
That was going to be my life.
was, you know, Waking Up With Rob on 97.7.
This right here is more reasons why you should listen from time to time.
Because we even went so far back as Travis found the video from when we were on the news.
Oh, God.
When we were interviewed by Christina Warner.
Because we were doing this thing that was so unique that was...
Never Heard Of in Sacramento.
It was such a unique thing.
And now, you know, everybody and their dog has a podcast.
Yeah.
But we were doing it way back when.
You know what it makes me think of?
Oh, it's so much fun.
By the way, that was the greatest moment in nine years of Orange Lounge Radio.
I will say it was that, oh, it's so much fun.
One of my favorite movies is a lot of our old school listeners know is Pump Up the Volume.
I still think we have a better audience than any kind of tickling guys ever could get.
I...
I will also say this about Interest Nation Live.
The episode where we randomly called the Bunny Ranch and ended up talking to dude for like two hours.
Dennis Hopp was trying to get me to go there for free.
Was possibly easily one of the top, maybe the top thing that has ever happened on internet radio for me.
You know what one of my favorites was on USL?
Calling Disneyland when there were phones in the park.
and then the Disney... We've actually been trying that recently but it's so hard to find a live phone line in Disneyland anymore.
Don't forget when we called Iraq.
Yes.
We called a hotel in Iraq and we tried to book a hotel room for George Bush.
We're coming to get you.
That was terrible.
Hey, whose birthday show is this?
Okay, last email.
all caps Bobby wishes or happy 9th birthday with a birthday taco tacos all caps Bobby he's not pregnant he just really likes tacos that's how you have to read all caps Bobby I'll save the Bobby comments for his show I always read Bobby's emails last he's got a 6 year anniversary and 300 episodes he's having a sexiversary thank you Bobby but now I think I'm all lowercase alright
Is that it for emails?
Yarp.
Thank God.
Narp.
Nailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Narp.
Loki, some gaming news amongst all this talk of the Bunny Wrench.
All right.
Yes, unfortunately, no Bunny Wrench games to transition into that, but we can talk a little bit about Bungie.
Bungie's doing the kind of anniversary of Halo thing right now, or I guess anniversary of Bungie.
20 years of Bungie.
and, um, with that, uh, a guy by the name of, uh, Daniel Bleszek, he's been working on an iPad port of, um, Marathon, and I guess, uh, basically now it's almost ready to go, and it's pending, um, Apple's approval right now for the low, low price of zero dollars, and, um...
If that isn't enough, apparently they're also releasing the final game of the Marathon Trilogy Infinity to the open source community.
So maybe that will also come to the iPad since it will be open source and someone can port it over.
Pretty awesome.
All right.
And then let's see.
Yeah, that's it for now.
Alright, let's move on to a story about Silent Hill Downpour.
Well, guess what Silent Hill Downpour, or as some are calling it, Silent Hill Alan Wake, Silent Hill Downpour will not have Pyramid Head.
Aww, you guys know Pyramid Head.
And it will not be good either.
Unfortunately, some of the people that played at E3, I'm not hearing a whole lot of it.
But it will have 100% more corn in it.
It will have guns, and they're saying they're treating the gun like the gun in The Road by Cormac McCarthy.
There is a gun, but there are only three bullets, so how will you use them?
Hmm.
Well, that was kind of always what Silent Hill was about.
It was never about confronting things head on, but about, you know, what do you run from and what do you take on?
And I don't know if that's, that doesn't sound like a totally new concept to me, but whatever.
Let the shroomy go.
Yeah, so there won't be Pyramid Head, but there supposedly will be some other scary people.
Whoopie.
Alright, DarkSakura.
Shermie has left the room.
DarkSakura.
You have to make, you know, a nice wide path for Shermie.
So she can... Waddle on through.
Yeah, poor baby.
Okay, so Valve likes the Wii U. Ooh, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U. Confirmed, Valve likes Wii.
Wii U, Wii U.
Gabe Newell said at New York's Games for Change Festival that they like the Nintendo Wii U and he's quoted as saying Wii U seems to be a lot more powerful than the previous generation.
It sort of fits better into the scalability in terms of graphics performance and CPU performance so I think it'll be a lot easier for us to fit into our scalability model.
We've always loved Nintendo.
So, they're saying that they are still looking into different console counterparts, starting with the 360 and recently moving to the PS3.
They're saying that the Wii U is going to be scalable.
Maybe in Portal 3, you can be GLaDOS with that whole little screen thing.
Where all you control is the camera angle in the little room.
Now you're the troll.
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
FU to the remnants of my sinus infection deciding to move into my lungs.
Evicted!
F you to having a headache.
F you to the fact that I see a lot of things at pride festivals that make me not have a lot of pride and I'm talking about just drunk bitches that just go to get drunk and take their top off like it's just I I can't stand like it's like a frat party some of that shit that I see going on in the streets and it's just it's just dumb I don't know it doesn't make me happy
You want to show your pride?
Protest something.
That's how it all started.
Jessica Harper, any FUs of the week you want to get out?
FU to judgmental types.
And Drunami.
a few to completely sucking any sort of a sales job lost my job, oh well and a few to scheduling conflicts and not being able to seem to be able to get money for all these great games and other essential shit I need to get done at least a lot of them are going free to play that's the silver lining alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys Loki, got one more for us?
Yes, you know, as if ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace weren't annoying enough, they're going to now support Kinect.
Awesome.
So you spend $150 for the Kinect camera and you get to do wonderful things with your ads, including getting them to retweet bullshit onto your Twitter account.
By the way, anybody that retweets bullshit from the Xbox Live Marketplace is going to get unfollowed.
Thank you very much.
You can say, Xbox, tweet to let people know that you love Coke and not the good kind of Coke.
Or like, for example, you know, there may be a trailer for, you know, a movie or something.
You can go, Xbox, near.
and it'll show you the nearest retailer for whatever or Xbox schedule for watching a TV show or some bullshit like that.
It just sounds dumb.
One more story for you guys.
This story made Jessica Harper cry.
It's making me sad.
Go figure it's going to involve Billy Mitchell in a roundabout way making Jessica Harper cry.
And of course, Billy Mitchell was in a movie called The King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters Alright, it doesn't have to do directly with Billy Mitchell But the director of King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters Which was, what's his name, Seth Gordon He was the director of this movie He's apparently making a reboot of the movie War Games Boo!
That's right, the 1983 movie starring Matthew Broderick About hackers Let's play Global Thermonuclear War
There was even a ColecoVision game in 83.
Apparently he wants to reboot the movie War Games.
Why does this piss you off, Jessica Harper, if I need to ask?
Because I'm getting really freaking tired that nobody can come up with a unique idea anymore.
So hey, let's redo this.
Hey, let's redo that.
Oh wait, Logan's Run.
Yeah, that's been in production for how long now?
Oh yeah, let's redo Pretty in Pink and...
or the trailer.
I saw a trailer the other day for Footloose.
And I was like, what?
Why?
I completely understand that I know that I'm probably towards the end of the Gen Xer group because I think 77 was about the end.
But at the same time,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Stop it!
Stop it now!
You know what?
For a while, if you look at it though, they were copying a lot of Japanese movies.
Especially in the horror genre.
And then they started rebooting the horror movies.
Now they're rebooting... It's because everybody... It's like they don't have any unique ideas anymore.
It's too hard for them to come up with something that is different.
It's like if you want to get something good and different, you're just going to have to go to the indie market.
DarkSakura.com
It's acceptable.
It's acceptable.
And it's like bros get together and drink beer and watch My Little Pony.
Two words.
Periphery.
Demographic.
For the same reason that guys would like Powerpuff Girls.
Which was also freaking awesome, but I didn't buy into the whole brony crap.
Just like poker face.
You know what?
My...
When you said that, I started thinking of those little homies figures that you get out of the quarter machine.
No, it's nothing like that.
Mixed with a pony.
You remember Secret of the Magic Crystal with the pink anus and everything?
I have that game.
Imagine getting really high and or drunk and playing that game with your bros.
That's what the My Little Brony phenomenon is all about.
I'm going to love and tolerate the fuck out of you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
you know what's actually kind of funny my wife is terribly excited about the reboot of The Bodyguard with Rihanna
Because the first movie was so great.
She loves it.
She loves it.
It's a terrible movie.
But she loves the movie.
And she's going to love the body art because it's a terrible movie.
Because Whitney Houston cannot act at all.
She is terrible.
Period.

Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
Who's this?
Xenocore
Hey, I'm not sure, I didn't get to the beginning of this show.
Did you guys give out the news about Star Wars already?
No, we didn't, but now that you say it, I'm like, oh yeah, that was some pretty big news.
But Xenocore, since you brought it up, I'll let you share.
Well, they're turning it off.
Galaxies is going away.
Does this surprise you, though, with the new one coming out next year?
Not at all.
They're hurting, is what they're doing.
Sometime after the game, the servers are going offline in December.
What, you mean that new player experience didn't revolutionize the game?
Don't get me started, Rob.
My bad.
Did you hear that tone suddenly shift?
Oh no, you didn't.
It's not so much that, but that's going to extend this show about another hour and a half you get me on that.
He had such powers because it's so easy to become a Jedi now.
But yeah, they're going to turn it off at the end of December.
And they're just trying to herd all the players to the Old Republic is all they're really trying to do.
What can other games learn from Star Wars Galaxies?
Don't redesign the entire system without telling your players ahead of time.
Pretty good idea.
What do you most hope for when it comes out of the new Star Wars game?
I imagine you're going to play it if you're following the old one.
You're probably going to try the new one, right?
I'm reserving myself until I see it in action, though, because although technically the old game did not have any levels, it was skill-based, you can never avoid grinding in an MMO.
because you have to spend time using your skills to get better.
There's going to be a grind somewhere in there.
It's almost impossible not to.
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Nah, man.
Just keep up the good work.
Derpy Who's
There was an editing mistake in the first episode to where one of the ponies was drawn cross-eyed.
And so 4chan ran off with it and named her Derpy Hooves.
I have to look this up.
It's already on Know Your Meme.
There's a reference for it already.
Oh, this just in?
Yes, I've received a news bulletin.
And Rocketboom covered it as well.
I'm throwing out my fucking television when I get home.
Yes, that news just in.
There it is.
And on top of that, 4chan came up with a backstory that she's a mail carrier.
and since the the series creator is a lurker unfortunately she decided to incorporate it so later on she included this scene to where she messes up and drops some stuff one of the main characters heads
and they do a cut up in the air where all the Pegasus horses are looking at and you see Derpy who's dropping something, you know, on top of the other characters.
Xenocore?
Xenocore?
Xenocore?
You know way too much about this.
I pay attention to what I see and it's on three news shows already.
Are you now or have you ever been a brony?
I found a picture of Drippy Hooves and put it in the chat.
Oh, hooray.
All right, Xenocore, I'm just fucking with you.
Have a good one.
Thanks for the call.
Have a good show, man.
Later.
I am saving this.
How do I feel about 4chan controlling what's on my television?
I feel a little violated, actually.
I love the name, though.
Derp!
Derp derp!
877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Give us a call, we'll talk.
G4TV
Fabulous!
Fabulous!
Fabulous!
Fabulous!
Before I get into that, I just want to say tonight's show is just pretty damn awesome.
Well, thank you.
Because no one's been drinking yet, and it's just been awesome.
No one's been drinking yet.
We're high on life.
Oh, really?
I'm too old to drink now.
My bladder can't handle it.
Bullshit.
Y'all are probably high on pixie sticks or something.
God, here comes Dan.
All right.
Ah, shit.
So what's on your mind tonight, Rama?
What are you doing?
I have in front of me a bottle of Captain Morgan and a double shot.
Uh-huh.
A toast to Orange Lounge Radio, its hosts, the fan base, and a nine-year anniversary.
Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.
If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
Amen, brother!
I'm gonna feel that in the morning.
I'll drink to that, bub.
Mm-hmm.
Awesome.
So.
Yes.
Anything else you want to share with us tonight after that lovely toast?
Maybe.
What?
If we should announce it live on air.
Okay.
I'm a little afraid.
What are we going to announce live on air?
Something that we discussed on Twitter Friday night.
What's that, Ranma?
Our little engagement.
That's right.
Since gay marriage passed in New York, which of course is a wonderful thing, you know, it's great, you know, hooray for equality.
How are you and Ranma getting married?
Yeah, the first thing I did, I went to Twitter and I said, where's my marriage proposal, Ranma?
I knew it!
Well, Ranma, I'm not saying yes until I get a ring on it.
Well, you'll get the ring faster than Salacious Papa popping on there, I guess.
I don't know.
No, I mean, Salacious Pop knows that he's the one for me, but, you know, now and then, I like a little dark chocolate.
Well, you know what they say, why don't you go black?
You missed Dan in the other room, going, oh my god!
Dan, mad bro?
You mad bro?
Alright, well, Ranma, until our honeymoon, I gotta say goodnight for now.
That's quite alright, man.
Thanks for the call.
Just so you know, my girlfriend isn't mine because she plays on both sides.
No, I know, it's hot.
Alright.
Hell yeah.
Later.
Later.
Alright, 1877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Give us a call, we'll talk.
Are you sure?
Maybe I'll get more marriage proposals tonight.
Who knows?
We'll see.
What'll happen.
Now you need SSJ100 Matt to call you.
There you go.
Another New York.
That's what you're looking at me for, Rob.
Slices pops in chat and he's just commented on the situation.
He said the following.
Someone's about to wake up in the Hudson River, to be honest.
I'm not sure if that was for me or Ranma.
I guess we'll find out.
Bones006 says, once you go balk, you will never go back.
Nice typo there.
All right.
We've got time for one or two more calls.
Ranma said to Salacious Pop, oh baby heart.
Snap, snap, there's a call coming.
Snap, snap.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Scott.
Nathan Legend What is up?
I wanted to talk about Smurfs and 3D First question and response, how high are you?
Alright, let's talk about all at once, the Smurfs and 3D, all at once Okay, so I think this is going to be the best movie of 2000 plus
How high do you have to be to think that?
No, no, let's hear the man out.
Every gamer gets a voice.
Except you.
Okay, so first of all, I use Smurfs in my daily language.
So in order to complete my vocabulary, I say Smurf.
I say, what Smurf is it?
Like, what time is it?
So, you know, I believe this movie will help us.
You know what?
You're getting sonic screwdrivered.
How does this game rate on a scale of one to five Smurfs?
Exterminate!
Is this game like a jokey Smurf or is it like Smurfette?
Is this game a jokey Smurf or is it the one game in the village everybody else is going to bang?
Smurfette.
Now Smurfette's got younger competition, remember?
For legal reasons.
So you really think that the Smurfs is going to be the greatest cultural phenomenon of our time.
They're going to refer to this generation as the Smurf generation.
Yes, it's going to change the economy and everything.
Until the advent of Derpy Smurf.
We'll have to pay him Smurfberries.
And it's all because Obama's president, according to the BBC, apparently.
Yes, we can't come up with Smurfs.
Yes, we can.
Yes, we can.
Smurfs 2012.
Papa Smurf for president.
He'd be a little old.
And that and he's not from America.
From America.
I'm from America, USA, USA I have a response to that whole thing
You know what?
One thing I will never regret about nine years of Orange Lounge Radio is phone calls like that.
Things that just make you say, what the fuck, guys?
You know what?
Hey, the only downfall is that we don't have our sweet around.
We have a Swedish con!
Well, then fine.
I'm going to have to call.
I'll run outside.
I'll say, hey, be right back, guys.
I got to use the bathroom.
I got to take a big dump.
And then I'll go outside and I'll call my cell phone.
Which is funny because the bathroom is like across the hall from the studio.
Oh, this is the Swedish chef.
And I'll just be the Swedish chef calling in.
And it'll be incredibly racist.
We could call the IKEA customer service line.
Rob.
I'll just play ABBA.
Let's just settle on Mr. Bucket for president.
Do not bring that to the show.
Mr. Bucket.
God, that thing is so funny.
Did you watch the angry video game nerd when they were being haunted by Mr. Bucket?
Do I want to know?
No.
I love the angry video game nerd.
This was great.
Alright.
Let's go to one more call here.
Let's see what happens.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
What is up, Saku?
Nothing much, just getting ready for tomorrow for work.
And just congratulating you on...
Like what, nine years now that you've been on the air?
Yeah, it's been about nine.
So, Zaku, you've been here for almost nine of those years.
You've been here for quite a bit of it.
I know that much.
Yeah, I think I was here for seven of those.
What do you think, you know, there's an important question asked on Twitter a while ago.
What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years?
What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years of Orange, not just Orange on the Street, but in nine years of video gaming?
Oh, wow.
Damn, that's a... Well, I guess I could give you the benefit of both.
Like, for Orange Lounge Radio, you're breaking away from Live 365, changing up the format.
It's kind of like graduating.
You started off with Imani, but now you're just encompassing video games in general.
Yeah, we're out of pull-ups now.
Right, exactly.
I'm a big kid now.
Wow!
Video gaming, oh wow.
Just the fact that we've evolved from just playing with controllers and through traditional channels, through the arcades, but just evolving to not needing the controller at all.
Being the controller.
You being the controller, essentially, with the Wii.
Well, I know the Wii is kind of like you do need the controller, but you're using your extremities to actually...
to register input.
I got one extremity I still can't use to play a game.
Oh, I'm sure there's ways, sir.
I am sure of it.
You're just not thinking out loud.
The first thing I'm doing when I get my copy of Child of Eden is I'm going to try playing with my dong.
In nine years, I've seen basically Microsoft take that little platform that could and just go far with it.
I have to admit.
They did ten times as better as the Atari Jaguar.
Just be thankful, listening audience, that they don't have a cam right now.
Sorry, I was doing my Child of Eden with my dong while you were talking.
Isn't that illegal in some states?
Probably.
See, Rob, that won't work because you don't have a glove at the end to make it look like a hand because it still thinks it's a penis.
Oh, shit.
but yeah it's like that that whole evolution like gaming it's like it's it's going beyond what I when I grew up with before then was just like you know going to a friend's place to play like Genesis and Super Nintendo games or the PlayStation but it's like something you could sit down you could go online through Xbox or PS3 and just like you know and get yelled at by by 10 year old kids
We've come a long way from the old school Atari 2600 controller, which if you think about it now was kind of phallic.
I mean, yeah, it's very archaic.
It's so primitive that it was just a four-way stick and a button.
That's all it was.
I'm saying a giant phallus, basically.
All the way down to at least 8 to 10 actual controls on a controller.
And with the fact that you could actually use your body to control things.
I mean, the next step will probably be PS9 when they insert...
When they actually feed all that data straight into your head.
It's the holodeck.
Every generation of gaming is one step closer to the holodeck.
Yeah, we're close.
All we need is the VR headsets.
All we need are headsets in which I can basically play back memories and other stuff or just have that piped directly into my brain.
And that's it.
I just literally sit there, close my eyes, and I basically become that deeper into the game.
You are the machine.
And then you're a Borg.
I'm still thinking about my dong.
Anyhow, all right, Saku, we've got to let you go to get some more calls.
All right.
But take care, buddy.
All right, have a good one.
Bye.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Swedish.
I guess we can do one more call.
Swedish.
I guess we could do one more call.
Whoever might call us on our nine-year anniversary show.
See what happens.
Yeah, we're running a little long tonight, but whatever.
It's a birthday show.
We can do that.
Why are you complaining about something running a little long?
IDK
Are you still reading about that derpy horse?
I was trying, because he said it had been... It's like a fan character that was... My intention on bringing up the My Little Brony thing was not to get you all addicted.
That's actually not what I meant.
Those are not baked goods.
Those are baked bads.
I am just reading the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic wiki.
Okay.
Hey, we have an Orange Launch Radio wiki.
Did you know that?
It's been updated.
And if we can get a wiki, they can get a wiki.
I look at it weekly.
Do you?
Yes, when I have to pick the classic game.
Let's go to another call.
Maybe this will be the last one.
Why am I giving out the number again if this is the last call?
No!
Oh, no!
You talk about this weed!
Oh, boy.
Jessica Harper's... Oh, well.
What the hell?
Bork, bork, bork to you too.
Jessica Harper has summoned the Swede.
And just like that, a wild Swede approaches.
Quick, throw a pester ball.
Dancing queen, feel the beat.
A half-gay, oh yeah, um, a little woman who says it.
Oh, well, what the hell.
Um, but here's the thing, though.
But, but, but, but, but, here's the thing, though.
It's like, yeah, Swedish music festivals are like, it's like Swedish fucking play, you mother fucker!
and I'm gonna see it.
The Swedish Music Festival is the same weekend as the 10th anniversary of OLR.
That's the whole thing.
If we can't get the Swede
on USL for our anniversary, then of course I'm going to have to subject you to the Swede on your anniversary.
Thank you very much, Jackie Rupert.
You heard it here first, 10th anniversary from the Swedish Music Festival.
Well, here's the thing.
If the Swede can't make it to 10 years of USL, then 20 years of USL will be in Sweden.
Oh, okay, yeah.
There we go.
There you go.
So we'll be the ones up at five-something in the morning because we have to maintain the time zone.
No, it will actually be in Sweden so that Travis can start off the show by saying, Sweden, I am inside you.
And that excites the owls far too much, obviously.
Oh, yeah.
To question from our chat room, TigerClaw wants to know, is the Swedish music festival a rave?
No, it's not, but it's like Arvika Festival is kind of in a way, yes.
Let me ask you this.
How many people will you make out with at the festival?
If I know myself, none.
Then it's not a rave.
Well, the unfunny part is that, well, I'm like one of those...
I don't know, because here's the unfunny part, is that the thing is that I haven't went to a so-called classical Swedish music festival in like six or five years.
So I don't know, I might be out of touch of sorts.
See, I think I can get closer, and that's the only reason I stick with Pot of Pot of Paradise, drop E, and hump the coin return.
Okay, oh well, I have.
I'm going to let you have the last say here tonight on the Skype line and I want to know the question I've asked a few other callers that we got through Twitter what's been the most impactful thing in the past nine years in gaming do you think?
Ooh, that's... I have no idea.
The only thing that I can think of off the top of my head is like the Wii controller!
What the hell?!
No, no, I'm sorry.
I apologize to the rest of the listeners at this point, but Travis and I have to know.
Have you shoved a Wii controller up your butt today?
No!
No, I have not, unfortunately.
I have shoved other things off my butt.
Thank you, sir.
And he doesn't disappoint.
And we'll end on that note.
Thank you, Aki Ripper.
Have fun at the Swedish Music Festival.
So, later.
Later.
I can think of no better way to cap off nine years of Orange Lounge Radio than that.
Now we have 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry, so bye everybody.
I haven't shoved Wii controller up my ass today, but I shoved something else up my ass.
Hey, Mr. DJ.
Rob just turned red.
You're welcome.
You're so very, very welcome.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as if I need to ask tonight.
Loki, thank you for being here as you always are.
No problem.
And let's make it to year 10.
What's your final thought tonight?
My final thought tonight is Earth Defense Wars, Insect Armageddon next week.
I cannot wait to play it.
Screw everything else.
I don't give a crap about your fucking Black Eyed Peas experience.
It's all about blowing up insects.
Large insects.
Let me go to the guests tonight and get their final thoughts as well.
Drew Nami, first off, our ever-present intern.
Good luck with everything going on in your personal life.
I know you got a lot of change coming on the horizon, but we appreciate you stopping by to tip your hat at our little program, our Dog and Pony show.
I'll be back.
All right.
Your final thoughts tonight?
Wii Controller, what the hell?
Jessica Harper, I don't know what to say to you right now I think I'm going to thank you for being here tonight I might take that back tomorrow Once the ratings come in for the show In all seriousness, best of luck on your audition Knock them dead And let's karaoke sometime, that would be fun Yeah, totally Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
I'm just going to do my final thought as a nice big butt plug.
And please, guys, go ahead and go to understationlive.org and download some podcasts.
Check us out.
If you like us, we're on Saturdays for two hours, 8 p.m.
Pacific, 11 on the East Coast.
And they let Aki Ripper go for like 20 minutes sometimes.
But Travis has the common decency to hang up on people, too.
Alright, and let's see, I'll let DarkSakura go last, so I'll give my final thought.
My final thought is thank you everybody.
That's my final thought.
Thank you.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I am a banana!
I live in a giant bucket.
My spoon is too big.
From all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, thank you for putting up with us for the past nine years.
My anus is bleeding.
We do it for you.
I'm not sure why you keep letting us do it to you.
But thank you for being willing.
If you've enjoyed the show, tell a friend about the show.
And maybe you'll offend them.
We'll see you next week.
If we don't get cancelled.
Have a good night, everybody.
