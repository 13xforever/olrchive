00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
George, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loku

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, June 5th, 2011, the E3 rumors start to roll in a day before the first press conference

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
The track listing for the Play for Japan benefit album is unveiled

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
And soon you can raise pets in The Sims 3

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
We're going to talk about video games over the next three hours or so

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
And you can join us if you're listening to us live at All Games Radio

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
www.allgames.com

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-host, say hello to the one, the only, the lovely DarkSakura

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Jamie Summers, how are you?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm recovering from my party

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
It's your party and you'll cry if you want to?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I cried when everyone left

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I was like, they're gone

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Now it wasn't your birthday, it wasn't a birthday party, so what was the party?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
It was for me getting two associates degrees

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
After 15 years of going to college

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
You are a professional student

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I've changed my major so many times it's the problem

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
So I got my art new media which is basically graphic design

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I have liberal arts and then next spring I'll have social sciences

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You just like to learn

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Actually I really enjoy college, I do

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
If I could, if I could get paid to be a student like mystery shop teachers or something, that would be bliss

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Mystery teachers

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Seriously, I'd be mystery student

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Mystery student

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah this teacher sucks

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Rate my professor and all that stuff I guess

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Put it in the student's hands

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Are they hot or not?

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Alright, the voice over there of course, the one and the only tech master, Loki

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
How you doing?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm doing good

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Alright, by the way we were off last week so it's a little interesting to be back here after two weeks

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
But I hope you all had a good Memorial Day weekend

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I don't know what you guys did

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I went to Disneyland, it was fun

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
But what else is new here at Orange Lounge Radio?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't ever travel anywhere else

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We're going again

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
I know and I'm going again this weekend and I'll get into more of that later on because it's kind of sick

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, Loki what have you been up to?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
What did you do with your days off?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Um, I don't remember

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Probably not sleeping

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Ah, it's that time huh?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We mean it's that time

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It's been that time for ten months

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I thought he was sleeping through the night, now he's not anymore?

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, he sleeps through the night but he also wakes up about eight times during the night

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I see, I see

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
Alright, well of course if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, Loki and the Mrs. gave birth to Josh what about nine months ago?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Ten months ago

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
He didn't give birth to him

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Well you know what I mean

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
He was there when it happened

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
But he did not go through labor

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
He contributed, he made a very important contribution to the whole process

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, but the woman does all the work

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Here we go

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Okay

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
You and your women's lib

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
No

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Stop burning your bra here on this show

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm not even wearing one

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Alright, alright

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Moving on

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I'm in my pajamas for tonight's show

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
The chatters in chat.orangelandradio.com are like oh yeah, prove it

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Alright, anyhow

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Here I will

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Here comes Dan who's on mic

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Shut up

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
What did he say? I didn't even catch it

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I didn't hear what he said either

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Something blah blah irrational psycho, that's all I picked up

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
He just needs to shut up forever

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
That was enough for me

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Go back to watching your pinball thing

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Let's go back to of course video games

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's a big week for video games, I'm not sure if you heard

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
The E3 convention is coming up this week

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
We're going to be covering E3

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm going to start off the show actually by talking about this and we'll get into our gaming week

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Our schedule is like so screwed up over the next couple weeks

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Because we didn't do a show last week

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We're doing a show tonight

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
We're not doing a show next Sunday

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Because we're doing shows Tuesday and Wednesday

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
This next week

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
They are live E3 specials, different place

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
They're not going to be at AllGames.com because there's other stuff going on

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And we also wanted to help you guys learn about our brand new Ustream channel

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Is now up and running

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Our username there is OrangeLounge

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
More information will be available at OrangeLoungeTrader.com later this week

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And best of all, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Who does the show before us here at AllGames Radio

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Will be joining us over the Tuesday and Wednesday nights

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
To be talking about what he's observing at the show floor

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
What's going on behind the scenes at the press conferences

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
What Sony is filling five and a half hours with, pray tell, tomorrow night

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And then Miklotov is also going to be joining us

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
They're both going to Nintendo's press thing

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
And will get to fill us in on what it was like to play

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Whatever Nintendo's calling their new system

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Without a three and a half hour wait

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Or whatever long that line is going to be at E3

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Which I am looking forward to not standing in

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
It's very strange because it's not like I haven't been to E3 before

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I didn't go during the airport years

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
But it's going to be interesting doing coverage from this end of things

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
But I'm happy that we'll be able to produce something a lot more slick

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Where we'll be able to take your calls

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Have the live chat room which will still be in the same place

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Chat.OrangeLoungeTrader.com

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And let you guys interact with the E3 coverage

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
And of course, give your feedback

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And there will be voices here in the studio

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Voices on the E3 show floor

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And your voices out there all over the internet

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Aw man, I gotta wait until Tuesday

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
For Nintendo, yeah

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Just so you guys know how it's all going down

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Tomorrow there is no expo

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
The expo floor is not open

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
But the E3 show kinda starts

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Because that's when the press conferences start

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Microsoft kicks it off in the morning

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Then Sony is going to be in the evening

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Scrunched in there, Ubisoft and EA

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Konami already happened

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Which we'll be getting to a little later

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
We'll talk about what they talked about

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
They're not doing their own conference

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Also I noticed left out Activision

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Unless I just completely overlooked it

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Which is possible, I'm sure somebody in the chat room

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Will jump in with that if I may say

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They also tend to usually have a lot of announcements

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Like Call of Duty will usually be shown as Sony

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Or Microsoft's conference

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
It's like, woah, I've never seen that before on these

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Consoles, yeah

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
My thought too is that Activision kinda really blew their load

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Last year with that whole Eminem, Rihanna

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
All those celebs they paraded out

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
On stage for DJ Hero 2

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Which then, well you know

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It didn't end up doing so hot

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Although it was a fine game, I enjoyed DJ Hero 2

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, here I was asking

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Because my boss is going, actually my boss

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And our vice president of sales

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
The guy

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Doesn't know anything about gaming

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
So he's going to E3

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Awesome, anyway

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
So they're going, now it's like so you guys going to any of the

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Parties or anything while you're there

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's like, no, it's not anything like

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You know, when they had the DJ Hero 2

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Thing where they had like, you know, people DJing

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And Eminem and stuff like that

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
They're having, I don't remember which

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Publisher it is, but someone's having a

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Bowling night

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Nice, nice, Black Wolf

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Our good pal is in our chat room saying

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Activision has a booth, but they don't have a concert

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So it is, yeah

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Whatever their big announcement is might be at one

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Of the other press conferences, I think you're right on with that

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So we'll say

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
They don't have really any big announcements

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
They've got to be this year

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
They've got to give us more details on the Bungie thing

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Because right now, all they've got coming out

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Well, they've announced everything up through the third quarter

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
As of last week

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
So they haven't announced their fourth quarter stuff

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Other than Call of Duty

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
But

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
There's not a lot that they can really cram in there

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Usually there's a

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Guitar Hero game around that time

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
But I mean, they've got

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
What, the X-Men game

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
They've got the new Spider-Man game

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
They have a

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Crappy Spyro game that has

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Some stupid little toy thing that you've got to

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Scan your toy in order to play the character

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
In the game

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And then of course they've also got

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
I think they're going to have a big

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I think they might be blowing a big announcement

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
About Diablo before

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Before Blizzcon

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Blizzard's all their own thing

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
They're not going to announce any of that

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Activision has been the one calling the shots

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
For a little while, which is why some of us

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Wow advocates think the game's gone

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
A little bit south the past couple of years

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
They may announce a console port

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Because there's already rumors that they hired people

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
To port over the Playstation 3

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I actually think that's exactly what the announcement's going to be

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But we'll get into that later

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
We'll get into E3 predictions a little later on

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Woohoo!

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm going to try

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
We're going to go

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
This is definitely live radio here

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
We actually have a man on the ground

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Already in LA who's also going to be joining us

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
On the Tuesday and Wednesday shows

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
We're actually going to give him a call right now

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Live, unscripted

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
He's actually at some type of event already

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And I want to get more details on that

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I know he's already been by the convention center

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So we're going to give our old buddy Miklotov a call

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And see what's up in LA right now

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This may be botched a little bit

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
He's at some event

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And I'll get some more details on what's going on

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It could be very noisy

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Two ringing dingies

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Hey Miklotov

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Hey what's up

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Hey not much, it's Rob of course

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You know that because I've been text messaging you

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Where are you at? You're at an event

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
The E3 parties have already started

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
What's going on?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah this is the

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
What is this I'm at?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
What am I at right now?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It's for Major Nelson's

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Twitter

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And it's

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
A huge meetup where they're giving away

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Food and drinks

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And free bowling

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And most importantly

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Passes to the

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Fresher event tomorrow

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Wait are you at a bowling alley?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Yes

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
No that's not it

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Major Nelson's doing the bowling alley thing too

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
There you go

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Well what's going on at the event?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Are there any games that you can see?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Anything or is it just a bunch of

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Bros getting together tossing balls around

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Here at the bowling alley

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It's just some colored balloons

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
But I actually went into the

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
E3 expo hall

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
today and looked up what they have on board

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Hold on hold on hold on

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Put that on Twitter everybody

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Microsoft unveils colored balloons

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
At E3

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's a brand new thing for the connect colored

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
This is almost as good as

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Space suits last year

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
They are green and white

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And I guess that's purple for connect

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Breaking

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Orange Lawns Radio exclusive

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
This is an exclusive report

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I don't know what you're saying but they're about to get more tickets away

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So I'm going to hang up on you. Goodbye

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Yep that's just

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
That's exactly what it's going to sound like Tuesday and Wednesday

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
As well is that we'll get the nice professional

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Radio call from Bobby Blackwolf

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And then when he decides he's got to hang up to go to a swanky party

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Then Megalotov is going to call us

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah I don't know what really happened today

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But I saw some balloons

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Go and run that IGN

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Colored balloons

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I remember where the space suits were last year

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Cosmic jumpsuits or something like that

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Space ponchos

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I was just talking about that last night

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Space ponchos

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
With Alan in the car

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Let's move on and get into how is your gaming week

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
We always like to start off the show when it's not E3

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
With how is your gaming week

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But tonight was a little special. Dark Soccer how is your gaming week

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
There was a crap load of rock band

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Last night. We had rock band 3

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And Beatles rock band going on last night

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And I sang

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
A lot and my throat hurts

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I haven't lost my voice

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
What did you sing? What are your specialties?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Well I don't have

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The song that apparently everyone says I'm really good at

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So I was

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Singing um

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Chemical romance

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And uh

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
What else did I do?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
9 in the afternoon. Panic at the Disco

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Which is like one of my favorite songs

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And um

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I think I did some Kansas

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
And

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Any chance we get you to hum a few bars?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
No

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And I also did

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I sang just about everything that we did in Beatles

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Rock band except for like 3 that

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Drew Nami

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Sang

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
He was at the party too

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
There was a blast from the past. Intern Drew. Good job

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And um

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I also played Wow

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Which I did today

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And yelled at the ship for not arriving on time

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Or at least on time in my universe

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Sorry I have to share this. Mikolatov just texted me

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
He's like you can call me back it was too loud

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
To hear the numbers. I'm like I will call when you have something

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
News besides colored balloons

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Don't judge

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Um

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
They're green and white

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
No shit

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It's Xbox

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And Dan's been playing LA Noire

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And I've beat Portal 2 now

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
For like the 9th time

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And I'm on my 10th playthrough

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
On single player mode

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And I find something new every time

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It's fun

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But I finally got the Smash TV

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Achievement Rob

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Well all the other ones are easy

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Except for the last one you have to get

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Which is the room where

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It's like you go in

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And there's uh

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Glass to your right

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And then there's 3 turrets

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And the button you need to press is in front of the turrets

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
On the other side of the glass

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
So you have to go across and send the

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Little uh

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Tube to send your blue goo across

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
But you have to throw the goo

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And knock down 2 of the turrets

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And then go in the hole

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That's above the last turret

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And manage to jump down with enough

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
momentum to where you land just behind the turret

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Pick it up, carry it over

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And set it down straight so that it does not fall over

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And die to where it shoots bullets at Wheatley

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And then

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That's how you get the last one

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
That sounds complicated

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It's super complicated and it took me something like

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
25 tries to do it because

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I get motion sick

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And after try number 15 I wanted to throw up

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
But I kept doing it

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And I finally got it

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And then I like saved the game and left the room

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Hard work pays off

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
The other ones were super easy

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Alright anything else for your gaming week?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Um

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
We had pie

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Orange sickle cupcakes

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
My gaming week was alright I didn't play a whole lot

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I played portal through a little bit again

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Cheating all the way this time

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Which is fun mainly just

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Kill time

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I didn't really want to play anything else

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Um played more Grand Theft Auto as usual

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And um

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Let's see

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Also a tiny little bit of

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
L.A. Noire didn't really get a whole lot of time

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
To play it

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But I made it through you know like the first

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Kind of case that you have there

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Um it's interesting I mean

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
The game is really detailed but uh

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I don't know I'd probably get into it

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I just have to have some time to play it

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
That's pretty much it

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Wow

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Sounds like uh you had a pretty

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Quick week for games

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah well I'm still working on

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
You know Grand Theft Auto mods

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And a whole bunch

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Of other garbage

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Anything that you're kind of looking

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Forward to with the next week? Any demos

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
That might hit the store that you're like ooh I gotta play that

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
No oh by the way my uh

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Dev console got banned from

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Partner net which is kind of disappointing

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
How'd that happen? How'd you get caught?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
It's just they eventually ban all of them

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
You know after a while

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
But it doesn't matter there wasn't really

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Anything on partner net that I wanted to play

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
It was all Xbox Live or arcade games

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
There's no like you know betas

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
For you know another Halo or something

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Like that you're not gonna find anything juicy like that on there

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Um and

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It besides all those

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Games that are on partner net

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Other people aren't banned and those people

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Leak out those games for everyone

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Else with JTAG consoles so

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Eh whatever I decided

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
To check to see if there's any E3 demos on there but

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You're getting better about hiding that stuff

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Eh whatever I

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I don't really even care

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Well if it's anything like last year like almost all the trailers

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That will be at the press conference tomorrow

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You will see then show up on E3 or

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm sorry on Xbox to download so you know

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
You'll see it in glorious HD

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm not even worried about playing demos

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
For stuff um you know there are

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Are some games that look really awesome

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Like you know Saints Row 3

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I was pretty excited for

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
From the get go cause I love Saints Row

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
It's just kinda it kept

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
The fun aspect and just the

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Really over the top part

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And they just keep building up on it and

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You know the first game was sort of a Grand Theft Auto

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Ripoff but it's really become kind of its own

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Thing and I love

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Just the whole game it's just

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Really fun and the new

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
The new one that they have coming out this fall

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It just looks amazing

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I really I can't wait to play it

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Even if they do announce a new

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You know Grand Theft Auto game

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I love both games both series I think can

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Coexist because they're just kinda

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Different I am very disappointed though

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
That the third um doesn't have

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Online multiplayer

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
As far as like death matches and stuff goes

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Because I mean I don't know

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
The first game was kinda

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Eh it wasn't very good as far as

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
That they had online and the second game

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
They tried to mix it up a little bit but it was really

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Wacky the way they had everything they really

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Shoulda just stuck with you know

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Kinda doing a Grand Theft Auto style where it's

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Okay here's a portion of the map that you play

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
In and go you know something

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Simple like that but uh they tried to

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Do some funky stuff with it and it was alright

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But it's the maps that they had are really

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Kinda limited and you know

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The fun is kinda limited too but at least they have

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Online co-op for two players this time

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Let me go um to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Uh and I think

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Breakman's pretty much echoing something you just said here

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Saints Row 3 doesn't have any multiplayer versus

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Though frown. Yeah just uh

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Two player online co-op like the second game

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Which is fun you know cause I

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'm Grand Theft Auto so

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Co-op can be fun. Yeah co-op is fun and

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It was actually a lot of fun playing a

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
System Link co-op with uh

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
The second Saints Row game so I'm

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm looking forward to this new one

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
For sure and I mean

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
You know

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And you know right now I'm still playing lots of

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Grand Theft Auto but that's gonna

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Interrupt or something's gonna interrupt that

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Though come July cause July

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
July 5th to be exact

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Is when we get

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The new Earth Defense Force game

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh that's gonna be awesome

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Counting down the days. Oh yeah

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Alright let me get to my gaming week um

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Quite a bit actually this week we'll start with demos

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You know I usually don't like to review

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Games based on the demo but when a big big demo

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Comes out I like to kinda get my first impressions

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
On it uh Dungeon Siege 3 is the demo

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I downloaded which is available uh

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I was surprised that they were even gonna make a Dungeon

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Siege 3 because I kinda thought the first two games

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You know they they made their point they had their

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Relevance of course they were PC only titles

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Uh but now Square Enix

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Is behind the publishing of this third

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Game uh that's happening uh now

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
On the consoles uh and I believe

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
PCs later on so the demo's available

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
On Xbox Live. It's all the same time. Huh?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah all the same time uh so the

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Demo's now available on Xbox Live and it's very

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Diablo-esque if you've never played Dungeon Siege

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It's very Diablo it was kinda Microsoft's answer to Diablo

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
In some ways uh and so the game's very

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Diablo-esque and uh it was okay

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
You know I had a good time playing it but um

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I thought like especially

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Following up a game like Torchlight

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Uh it was nice to kinda see the more

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Robust graphics and that Square

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Enix Cinema presentation

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Presentation style excuse me

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Um was it something I'm excited

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
To spend $60 on? No

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Not based off the demo but will I like

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Get it or get it in a bargain bin? Sure absolutely

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
You know it's a very challenging

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Position we're in right now in the gaming industry

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
With this whole it's gonna be interesting to see

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
What develops with this E3 because you know

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Some games you are expected to pay $60

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
For some games like

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Angry Birds you're expected to pay a dollar for

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Or even get free and it's really about

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Trying to find that happy price point and you know

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
We're talking about a new Nintendo console coming out

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
At E3. What are the games gonna cost?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Is Nintendo now gonna up the bar to $60?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Although some would argue they have

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Been already

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Oh yeah I don't doubt but are

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
The games gonna be worth it? I mean there's a certain point

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Where the consumer goes hmm do I really

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Buy this at $60 or do I just

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Wait till it comes down in price or

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't know like it's a tricky

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
NGP games are $50

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Wow really

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
But PSP games were $50

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Well not a lot of PSP games

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Were $50 but there were a few

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But like $40 is kind of you know

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
The price point

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
For the PSP but they did have $50

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Games

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So that's all I really want to say about the demo

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
It was cool

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Fable 3 I got to play which is a game

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Like a year and a half old so I bet a lot of you that were

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Interested in this have probably already played it but

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I was a little late to the party. I played the game

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's neat. There's a lot of concepts

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
In Fable I really like

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
But I sometimes wonder if this game tries to do

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Too much and at its core

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It's really repetitive

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And it's like a Facebook game

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Repetitive like

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I like the fact that you do these quests

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
To enhance relationship with villagers

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And I like this whole way that the

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Villager enhancement thing is built in but when you're doing

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
The same fetch quest or the same

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Delivery quest multiple

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Times you're like okay

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So what am I doing

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Here you know and this is I felt like

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It's just very very repetitive

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I cannot trust anything Peter Milano

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Says anymore I mean seriously

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
All of his innovative stuff is

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Such bullshit because it's just like

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Look at all this innovative stuff I added a dog

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
To my game no other game has had

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Dogs in it before this dog

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
You'll love no I didn't give a shit about the

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Dog yeah the dog was cool but you know what

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The dog was as cool as any other dog in

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Any other game the dog was actually

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Kind of stupid sometimes the biggest

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Crime for me that Fable 3 made

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I don't feel it took the series

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Forward I feel it took it back yeah I think

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Fable 2 was a much better game

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And I think it had that whole good

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
And evil thing developed and like Fable 3

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't even notice it it really doesn't even seem like

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That exists in it it's more about this whole

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Path to being a king more politics

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Which is a very repetitive

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Grind

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
And I kind of got like I was really into it

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
For about an hour and a half and then I got bored of it

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I got really bored of it and I was like you know

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
What I'm done I don't really want to play

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Any more Fable 3 and uh

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah I feel bad saying it because there's a lot

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
That I like about the Fable

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Series and I really liked Fable 2

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I think Fable 3 was rushed

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
To be honest I think they needed to wait

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Another year to put this game out there was a lot that was really

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Glitchy in it too and just I didn't like

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
The map system and good lord the

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Loading and like

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Just watching the screen draw

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Like oh

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
No this did not come out

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Like you should have Dan got rid of ours

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah and luckily

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I just borrowed this one so

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I'm giving it back

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
So sorry Fable 3 gets a

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Pass from me but the second one's good

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Third one's crap

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Not as good

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So if they are announcing a new Fable game at E3

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Which some think or I guess a Fable

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Side, wasn't Fable 3 supposed to have Kinect

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Later on? I'm kind of glad they

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Didn't to be honest but if they spun it off

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Into a whole new game I hope it's

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Interesting

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
No

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Anyhow

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Katsune in our chat room says I got really bored with it

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Quickly as well

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And the whole

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I know you all love this term

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Microtransactions for like outfits

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And weapons and stuff

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
No that was an obvious

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Bad that was just

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Microtransactions gone bad

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I would never drop a penny on any of it

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Period. Sorry

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
The other game I played

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
This week I got to watch

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Alan play the Duke Nukem

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Forever demo which hit

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Steam over the weekend and

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I have to admit I like

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's very tongue in cheek

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It does not make any

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Pauses about where exactly this

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Game comes from. Have you seen Loki

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
The opening sequence to Duke Nukem Forever

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
In the demo? Ah yes

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And I love that it starts in the

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Whole football scene which is very reminiscent

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Of the end of the last game which was in the football stadium

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But then it

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
This is a little bit spoilery but deal with it

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It's the first five minutes of the game

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
It pans out of the

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Football field or whatever

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And you see that Duke is actually

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Playing the video game

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And it pans out

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
So far that you see these two girls are actually

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Giving him a blowjob while he's playing the game

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
They are the Molson twins by the way

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
The Molson twins

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And they're like oh was that good for you

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Or wholesome twins or something like that

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It's basically the olson twins

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And they said something like

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Oh was the game good Duke

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And he goes yeah well after 12 fucking

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Years it better be

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
So I like that it made

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
No pauses about that but then

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
When Alan got into

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
The actual game all I heard was

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
This is hard this is bullshit

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
This is hard this game is hard

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
This is hard I hate this game this is bullshit

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
So apparently it's really cheap

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Why doesn't he just play it on an easier setting

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
He is playing it on like easiest

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Why doesn't he just get better

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
At games then

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Tell him he needs to go back and play Duke Nukem 3D

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I wish I could go back and play Duke Nukem 3D

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I can't really

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Accurately judge Duke Nukem forever

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Until I play multiplayer

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Because that's where everything Duke Nukem

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I mean fuck single player in that game

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Seriously it was not

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I mean after level 1

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
1 where you have the stripper

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And everything like that it's forgettable

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I actually really did like the single player

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The single player levels were pretty awesome

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I even like the atomic edition

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
With all the extra stuff that they added in there

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Like I love the level that was basically

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Disneyland which is pretty awesome

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I love the one that was in a supermarket

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
They had one at like a post office and stuff like that

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It was just those were kind of cool to me

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I kind of feel like I should just go back and play Duke Nukem 3D

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah but see though

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
We tried that though on

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Remember the 360 we all downloaded and got all excited

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And it kind of sucked

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Salacious Pop is yelling at me in the chat room

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Lies and slander lies and slander

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Lies and slander

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
That's what it sounded like to me my bad

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm sleeping on the couch tonight

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Alright um

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Is he on Skype?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I could call him to defend himself

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Do it

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Hold on I'll look up his number

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Isn't that sad I don't even know his number

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Because we live in such a cell phone age

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
That I don't need it

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I'm just going to call him and see what happens

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I know my husband's number

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Do do do do do do do do do do

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
This is just the night of random outbound phone calls

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Is what it is

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Let's call my mother next

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
We should have sent my mother to E3 wouldn't that have been fun

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Yeah

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Should be able to get in

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Pick up the phone

27:22.000 --> 27:29.600
gonna be all what's this number instead of the voicemail he's screaming no in

27:29.600 --> 27:40.320
the chat room he's not answering I went to voicemail all right live radio he's

27:40.320 --> 27:48.520
like my phone is in the other room oh he's running to fire out I'll try one

27:48.520 --> 27:57.200
more time one more time everybody in the chat room is yelling at him this is the

27:57.200 --> 28:01.520
best radio ever this is even funnier than sure me saying bless you in some

28:01.520 --> 28:06.680
apparently he was playing it on medium and I misunderstood that hello okay lies

28:06.680 --> 28:11.400
and slander I need to turn the radio down or else we're gonna have really bad

28:11.400 --> 28:16.480
gecko okay we're fine sure okay hi hi hi tonight's the night of random phone

28:16.480 --> 28:21.520
calls where I call people chatters you'll notice what so so then you tell me

28:21.520 --> 28:27.340
about the Duke Nukem demo since I clearly misunderstood once you get to

28:27.340 --> 28:32.200
the second part of the demo where you it shows you some vehicle play which is fun

28:32.200 --> 28:37.600
and then you get out of your truck and the background is brown and the enemies

28:37.600 --> 28:42.080
are brown so when they pop out I actually had a hard time seeing them and

28:42.080 --> 28:45.320
because I was playing it on me and difficulty by the time I could get

28:45.320 --> 28:49.600
behind cover I was dead already so I switched it too easy and then learned

28:49.600 --> 28:53.320
where the spawns were and then switched back to medium and I was fine but yeah

28:53.320 --> 28:58.120
it's it's I think there's some work that needs to be done on the clarity of the

28:58.120 --> 29:02.600
the mobs especially since they don't they all kind of jump out from behind

29:02.600 --> 29:07.700
things from out of nowhere so the game's gone gold now so whoops I don't know if

29:07.700 --> 29:14.020
they're gonna fix that yeah I know right so yeah I didn't it feels like Duke they

29:14.020 --> 29:18.640
definitely captured the humor and the attitude but as far as some amazing

29:18.640 --> 29:22.400
first-person shooter like Bioshock which was a completely different experience

29:22.400 --> 29:26.380
there's I don't think there's anything that remarkable about it it's pretty

29:26.380 --> 29:29.800
much all fan service the fact that it exists it means that it's going to sell

29:29.800 --> 29:36.280
but I don't think it's all that you know super amazing from the demo so do you

29:36.280 --> 29:41.360
think you'll invest 50 bucks or whatever in the full version on Steam hell no I

29:41.360 --> 29:46.680
don't care I don't care that badly that it's really kind of offensive and I mean

29:46.680 --> 29:50.040
obviously it's a dude bro game with the you know blowjob in the opening scene

29:50.040 --> 29:56.960
but I you know does the demo have multiplayer I don't think so hmm that's

29:56.960 --> 30:01.520
too bad all right all right well thanks for letting me bug you don't be mad okay

30:01.520 --> 30:04.480
but I want you I wanted you to be able to accurately represent and defend

30:04.480 --> 30:11.480
yourself I would never want to get your opinions yes all right okay who should

30:11.480 --> 30:15.840
we call next let's see okay no no we got a versus a show to do okay we got to get

30:15.840 --> 30:19.280
into news that's it for our gaming weeks quick housekeeping again I just want to

30:19.280 --> 30:24.640
clarify the schedule there will be no OLR next Sunday there will be two

30:24.640 --> 30:28.360
episodes at well are on the feed this week Tuesday night Wednesday night join

30:28.360 --> 30:32.680
us on our new you stream channel seven o'clock Pacific with special

30:32.680 --> 30:35.920
correspondent Bobby black wolf here's the great news I don't think this really

30:35.920 --> 30:39.240
affects anyone listening to this show but he's also gonna be posting the shows

30:39.240 --> 30:44.040
on his feed which I think is really cool so that way if you I don't know why you

30:44.040 --> 30:46.560
would be listening right now and you're not subscribed to our show but okay

30:46.560 --> 30:49.200
let's say you're not you can also get them from Bobby's feed so they're gonna

30:49.200 --> 30:55.480
be in both places for a maximum exposure I'm getting tweeted pictures by the way

30:55.480 --> 30:58.920
right now from miklotov who I guess went to the convention center earlier and I

30:58.920 --> 31:01.560
guess you know a couple days before the show you can just kind of walk right on

31:01.560 --> 31:06.040
in there and walk around he's not in the actual exhibition halls but let's see

31:06.040 --> 31:12.920
there's a giant ad for is Assassin's Creed revelations giant ad for that a

31:12.920 --> 31:17.040
little picture of the lobby that shows nothing really notable can't really see

31:17.040 --> 31:20.240
in the room there and they won't let him up the stairs I'm sure and then it looks

31:20.240 --> 31:24.120
like what they're advertising on the entryway is rage which is supposed to

31:24.120 --> 31:27.880
that big new shooter right which is gonna have a whole new engine that

31:27.880 --> 31:31.760
people are going to adapt kind of like what unreal brought to the table and

31:31.760 --> 31:36.120
there's these little gross little aliens crawling all over the entry plaza for

31:36.120 --> 31:40.240
rage so you can expect that that game is going to have a big presence and three

31:40.240 --> 31:42.840
so there you go

31:42.840 --> 31:48.240
I know our next Sunday because dark soccer and I will be at Disneyland with

31:48.240 --> 31:51.840
Bobby actually won't be there Sunday but we'll be driving back so and there will

31:51.840 --> 31:56.000
be a damn there will be a damn there will be a damn Dan will be here for the

31:56.000 --> 32:00.400
Tuesday Wednesday shows to us because Loki unfortunately will only be able to

32:00.400 --> 32:01.840
join what I can do

32:01.840 --> 32:04.880
he might try to pull some strings and join us live that would be amazing

32:04.880 --> 32:09.840
we'll see what happens when may you can call me you know I can do it over Skype

32:09.840 --> 32:11.120
or something like that

32:11.120 --> 32:15.080
all right for at least like from eight o'clock on but we need at least the

32:15.080 --> 32:19.040
Nintendo press conference feedback that's all that's yeah I agree Wednesday

32:19.040 --> 32:22.840
maybe you know maybe not Wednesday but like Tuesday would be fun because then

32:22.840 --> 32:26.200
that'd be after all the press conferences there you go

32:26.200 --> 32:30.080
all right anyhow let's move on with gaming news because we got a lot to

32:30.080 --> 32:33.840
cover tonight it's not just e3 but of course course e3 rumors are going to

32:33.840 --> 32:37.640
start it come on so everybody's talking about let's start us off Loki

32:37.640 --> 32:43.800
yes and I don't know I I think it's a dumb name but whatever

32:44.360 --> 32:49.440
there's a rumor that the what's being you know codenamed NGP right now is

32:49.440 --> 32:55.080
actually going to be officially revealed as the PlayStation Vita or the PS Vita

32:55.080 --> 32:58.840
or vita vita could be either way

32:58.840 --> 33:04.120
pens if they're going for vital or vitamin or vita pita

33:05.000 --> 33:13.200
yes and so well here's here's what evidence they have for that one there

33:13.200 --> 33:18.920
was a leaked or apparently leaked picture of a brochure showing the system

33:18.920 --> 33:24.720
with the PS Vita image on there and you know where is most people might say oh

33:24.720 --> 33:28.240
that may be photoshopped well there's least some other evidence to go along

33:28.240 --> 33:29.240
with that

33:29.240 --> 33:34.880
there's actually a few a few pictures of that so that's kind of interesting also

33:34.880 --> 33:44.880
there's apparently there was like a domain for developers that actually had

33:44.880 --> 33:52.440
a PS Vita for it's the Sony dev site they had that and then also there

33:52.440 --> 34:01.520
apparently there's text for the PlayStation Vita hidden away in the code

34:01.520 --> 34:07.320
for the e3 site for Sony so yeah I gotta say that that's probably true

34:07.960 --> 34:12.720
you know if it's if it's hidden away in their code on their website and it's

34:12.720 --> 34:17.280
also on their dev site and it's also in this brochure it's probably makes me

34:17.280 --> 34:20.480
feel great about the security of Sony in the future by the way

34:20.480 --> 34:25.280
um I also agree it's it's probably the right name it makes sense

34:25.280 --> 34:28.560
I it's you know they're trying to go for that catchy thing

34:29.120 --> 34:36.120
I also just the fact that do you guys remember last e3 everything got spoiled

34:36.120 --> 34:39.280
every no or was it two years ago yes well by them

34:39.280 --> 34:43.760
member with the end with the PSP go no not just that there was one year were

34:43.760 --> 34:46.520
like every big announcement that they were going to make was spoiled and I

34:46.520 --> 34:50.360
remember he got up on stage when he showed the trailer for Final Fantasy 14

34:50.360 --> 34:51.480
it was been two years ago

34:51.480 --> 34:54.880
he got up on stage to show the trailer for fantasy 14 everybody thought he was

34:54.880 --> 34:59.280
he had fucked up and meant to say 13 to but no it was actually 14 and then he

34:59.280 --> 34:59.800
goes

34:59.800 --> 35:05.160
hey there's one we kept from you like I remember that vividly in my mind like

35:05.160 --> 35:07.360
the rest of that press conference and spoiled

35:07.360 --> 35:10.360
yeah I'm glad you kept that one from us

35:11.200 --> 35:15.320
wish you'd kept it away from us forever you keep it a little bit longer

35:15.320 --> 35:19.800
I'm some other cool information regarding the NGP or Vita

35:19.800 --> 35:23.760
I guess we'll call the Vita it's going to be fully backwards compatible with

35:23.760 --> 35:26.920
all PSP games that are on the PlayStation Network obviously it's not

35:26.920 --> 35:28.560
gonna have a UMD drive

35:28.560 --> 35:33.560
it will also offer a smoothing and dual analog support so for example you know

35:33.560 --> 35:39.560
games like resistance retribution you know how they had the DualShock 3

35:39.560 --> 35:45.200
controller support if you you played that with PlayStation or the PSP Go or

35:45.200 --> 35:53.880
believe through your through the resistance like for the call that like

35:53.880 --> 35:57.400
the infected mode or something like that it's basically where it linked up

35:57.400 --> 36:02.080
with resistance to be playing through that you could also do DualShock 3

36:02.080 --> 36:06.520
support but now it's going to support for all games because you know obviously

36:06.520 --> 36:10.680
the new piece of hardware has tool you know dual analog sticks that's kind of

36:10.680 --> 36:11.120
cool

36:11.120 --> 36:16.240
I'm sorry I I'm late to the party and that's fine I'm actually waiting to hear

36:16.240 --> 36:20.320
a lot of this from Sony's mouth tomorrow but on this thing doesn't have a UMD

36:20.320 --> 36:20.880
drive

36:20.880 --> 36:25.200
it doesn't have any that doesn't have any dry has it has to physical like SD

36:25.200 --> 36:28.520
card proprietary some sort of storage card

36:28.520 --> 36:33.880
ok ok so there's some I was like they didn't learn from the go that people

36:33.880 --> 36:36.040
don't want to download no it's like a cartridge

36:36.040 --> 36:41.480
ok but yeah the rule is that there is no onboard storage at all for this thing

36:41.480 --> 36:44.600
you have to buy your own like memory cards or something like that but that

36:44.600 --> 36:49.880
each game would have its own you know card and there be space on there for

36:49.880 --> 36:53.920
download content with a tiger kalana term says they should have called it PS

36:53.920 --> 36:59.440
vivo which is Spanish for live might be ok name I think I think it's just going

36:59.440 --> 37:03.760
to be PSV is what's going to end up I think yeah PSV and I think it's vita for

37:03.760 --> 37:07.960
this is vital in for you to have because it has everything you know and that's

37:07.960 --> 37:11.760
that Sony's little tagline it only does everything and that's what you know and

37:11.760 --> 37:15.800
to be fair it was the strength of the PSP is it online you've a clip it is

37:15.800 --> 37:17.800
just like you know my own trees

37:17.800 --> 37:22.560
yeah I I would believe vita it's gonna and I think it's vital this is a vital

37:22.560 --> 37:27.120
it's vital for all gamers to have this I'm sticking with for clint that's how

37:27.120 --> 37:31.720
anyone who buys will handle and apparently you know the they've been on

37:31.720 --> 37:35.280
the record saying that they're gonna learn they've learned from the mistakes

37:35.280 --> 37:39.000
with the PSP and they're going to make sure they don't make them again with the

37:39.000 --> 37:44.920
the vita they're basically saying we wanted to our biggest mistake I would

37:44.920 --> 37:50.640
say with the PSP was that we were just so happy to provide the ps2 gaming on

37:50.640 --> 37:55.880
the go we kind of stop there is what we want to do with the NGP or fighter

37:55.880 --> 38:02.000
besides the great graphics and CPU think on what the interface could put in to

38:02.000 --> 38:06.160
make gameplay reality stand out I really stand out you know something that you

38:06.160 --> 38:12.640
cannot even do on the ps3 and yeah that makes sense with the rear touch pin the

38:12.640 --> 38:17.640
augmented reality stuff and touchscreen also but I think it's almost like too

38:17.640 --> 38:23.320
much you know like they have like some games that are kind of showing off that

38:23.320 --> 38:29.760
we're touching I don't know it's a little weird to me but we'll see and I

38:29.760 --> 38:35.080
gotta be honest you know I was kind of you know I'm one to kind of buy every

38:35.080 --> 38:38.240
console when it comes out and stuff but you know I'm probably actually not gonna

38:38.240 --> 38:41.080
buy one of these and the reason why is they were shown off some of the games

38:41.080 --> 38:44.880
that they have at launch or whatever they have a wipeout game and they have

38:44.880 --> 38:50.560
course ridge racer they have uncharted no ridge racer and some others and some

38:50.560 --> 38:54.520
other games like super stardust and stuff like that but I'm not a fan of

38:54.520 --> 38:59.080
uncharted I don't really care about wipeout so it's to me it's almost like

38:59.080 --> 39:05.000
hey look it's the 3ds lineup again no I'm not gonna do this you're not a fan

39:05.000 --> 39:09.640
of uncharted bless from her alright I wouldn't look at the chat room here with

39:09.640 --> 39:14.480
some of the comments about the name JV Mon in our charm says Vita equals life

39:14.480 --> 39:18.600
PlayStation life like you live a PlayStation life actually isn't

39:18.600 --> 39:21.320
PlayStation life the name of one of the channels like it's the one that no one

39:21.320 --> 39:25.040
ever uses that had the well they used it at first it has the news and the folding

39:25.040 --> 39:30.000
at home is that PlayStation life don't they call it that I don't know also

39:30.000 --> 39:34.840
salacious pop in our charm says living la vida joca we knew that joke was

39:34.840 --> 39:42.160
coming we knew that joke was coming moving on more rumors more things to

39:42.160 --> 39:46.720
talk about this time about Microsoft and some of the things that apparently they

39:46.720 --> 39:52.160
have coming and this news has to do with trademarks and other things that have

39:52.160 --> 39:53.800
been spotted out in the wild

39:53.800 --> 39:58.440
let's see fusion genesis is one of the trademarks that is shown up for

39:58.440 --> 40:05.040
Microsoft and also fusion vault infusion sentiment they are specified in the

40:05.040 --> 40:09.480
little trademark as entertainment services namely providing an online

40:09.480 --> 40:15.080
computer game so there must be some type of fusion series coming out for either

40:15.080 --> 40:20.320
xbox live arcade gotta be fusion frenzy I fucking hate no fusion frenzy that was

40:20.320 --> 40:25.000
a Hudson thing anyway was never Microsoft centric and you know they

40:25.000 --> 40:29.040
couldn't swap developers on you know Microsoft game okay but like if

40:29.040 --> 40:34.200
Microsoft was gonna buy a franchise like fusion frenzy which I don't think I

40:34.200 --> 40:37.200
mean I realize Hudson in the US kind of close but I believe they still have a

40:37.200 --> 40:42.000
Japanese presence so well just because why would you buy the fusion frenzy

40:42.000 --> 40:46.360
series that last game was awful and on top of that you know it's like Hudson

40:46.360 --> 40:51.040
was responsible for the Mario Party games and those weren't terrible it's

40:51.040 --> 40:56.880
just like for the 360 like or even the original xbox let's just not give a shit

40:56.880 --> 41:01.080
on this problem with all due respect to people that work at Hudson the biggest

41:01.080 --> 41:04.640
issue with Hudson is that they've had some really big hits and some huge

41:04.640 --> 41:10.520
misses like just wow wow like bomber man zero was a Hudson game if I'm not

41:10.520 --> 41:15.520
mistaken correct yeah yeah fusion frenzy too I think all bomber man games have

41:15.520 --> 41:21.640
been Hudson because Hudson created bomber man correct but the arc now see

41:21.640 --> 41:25.480
but when they hit they hit pretty well deca sports actually wasn't a bad game

41:25.480 --> 41:31.280
it was pretty nice little expansion of Wii Sports I the bomber man xbox live

41:31.280 --> 41:35.200
arcade thing was great for you know it was delivered exactly what people wanted

41:35.200 --> 41:39.400
out of a bomber man game but anyway how did we get from fusion to bomber man

41:39.400 --> 41:43.200
oh yeah that's because it's a fusion frenzy yeah you know the problem with

41:43.200 --> 41:47.680
Hudson is their own by Tommy I wonder if it's not their answer to pixel junk

41:47.680 --> 41:50.800
that's where my mind goes like it doesn't necessarily have to be like

41:50.800 --> 41:53.840
they're gonna go why do they need to even answer that I mean seriously

41:53.840 --> 41:59.360
because it's done well for so what so good a game is done well for Sony

41:59.360 --> 42:02.680
why they need to answer that they have plenty of good games on xbox live

42:02.680 --> 42:06.160
arcade hell there's good games coming out every week on xbox live arcade

42:06.160 --> 42:09.840
versus the PlayStation Network which doesn't get everything you know each

42:09.840 --> 42:14.960
week game guru in our chat says I think Microsoft owns the fusion frenzy license

42:14.960 --> 42:19.240
ok fine but really I really don't think these games have any idea of fusion

42:19.240 --> 42:25.080
crazy that last game killed the series let it let it die you know just I don't

42:25.080 --> 42:30.960
think this is it I mean I I don't know they could be a connect thing with me I

42:30.960 --> 42:33.800
think it's just gonna be minigame garbage unfortunately that's where my

42:33.800 --> 42:37.720
mind goes but it's just a freaking name it could also be the best game we've

42:37.720 --> 42:40.960
ever seen I mean we just don't know their names I'm gonna make the best game

42:40.960 --> 42:48.520
ever and call freaking garbage and you play a garbage man that's what well no

42:48.520 --> 42:56.040
ok case in point super meat boy hat I based on the name and the box art I was

42:56.040 --> 43:01.480
like this game looks stupid this game looks so stupid and then I played it I'm

43:01.480 --> 43:06.840
like oh my god schemes amazing so you know names do not mean everything anyway

43:06.840 --> 43:12.400
let's get to some other speaking of names some other registrations domains

43:12.400 --> 43:16.200
apparently some internet domain names that have been registered fabled the

43:16.200 --> 43:22.280
journey new fable game or possible Xbox Live or possibly fable connect fable

43:22.280 --> 43:28.760
connect this is what Milo turned into I'm thinking it's this all that whole

43:28.760 --> 43:32.640
like you can have him set down in the stream and you can hold the pieces of

43:32.640 --> 43:36.400
paper interacting with people fable the journey is what happened to Milo I know

43:36.400 --> 43:41.560
I don't even think it's that far I think it's just fable with some connect you

43:41.560 --> 43:47.840
know connectivity I guess I've abandoned no I've abandoned the whole fable series

43:47.840 --> 43:50.520
anyway so the hell with I don't even care what it is

43:50.520 --> 43:55.520
alright connect fun labs is another one that was already leaked though in an

43:55.520 --> 44:01.840
earlier thing I dance central to which I mean really duh really connect sports

44:01.840 --> 44:07.520
season two duh yeah also also pretty much a duh so the sequels to our two

44:07.520 --> 44:13.160
most successful connect titles never exactly again it's it's really all about

44:13.160 --> 44:18.920
okay what is the connect gonna give us that isn't part of the we I'm really

44:18.920 --> 44:22.280
interested in what this whole connect Star Wars thing is that because remember

44:22.280 --> 44:26.640
they if they had teased that last year and we got nothing well this is the year

44:26.640 --> 44:31.920
we need to see what connects Star Wars is all about all LucasArts got you know

44:31.920 --> 44:35.620
they have right now is just the Old Republic that's it they have nothing

44:35.620 --> 44:41.680
else slated to come out that they have announced all right go going to our

44:41.680 --> 44:45.200
chairman chat dot orange launch radio comm Randy and our charm says hold hands

44:45.200 --> 44:49.520
and fable with connect what the hell was that hand-holding thing anyway like it

44:49.520 --> 44:53.800
didn't make sense like just say follow me for well for escorting the girl and

44:53.800 --> 44:56.260
stuff it made sense but did you really have to be able to hold hands and run

44:56.260 --> 45:04.120
everybody through town it's just weird I go did it but I go she was I go all

45:04.120 --> 45:07.360
right moving on what did the press conference has already happened right

45:07.360 --> 45:11.920
dark soccer konami we had some announcements from konami we had the

45:11.920 --> 45:15.920
Metal Gear Solid HD collection that has Metal Gear Solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3

45:15.920 --> 45:22.680
snake eater and Metal Gear Solid peace Walker but the original one is not in it

45:23.960 --> 45:27.880
Twin Snakes though I mean that was that should have been in there they've

45:27.880 --> 45:33.040
already remade it once so but anyway it's going to be available on the ps3

45:33.040 --> 45:39.880
and Xbox and will support 1080p and on the ps3 there is a transferring feature

45:39.880 --> 45:44.480
well I guess transferring I should say it must have been misspelled no I think

45:44.480 --> 45:48.800
they are misspelling it on purpose they're little trans firing yeah yeah

45:48.800 --> 45:53.200
where you can transfer your peace Walker game from your PSP to your ps3 I know

45:53.200 --> 45:57.920
like how they pronounce million Marion you can trance you can transfer your

45:57.920 --> 46:03.120
game from the ps3 to the PSP there's also a zone of the enders HD collection

46:03.120 --> 46:07.840
so that has one of the enders and some of the enders too and not much else is

46:07.840 --> 46:11.960
said about that except that they're thinking it'll be out in 2012 and it'll

46:11.960 --> 46:20.560
be a ps3 and Xbox 360 and it will also have trans firing much better but there

46:20.560 --> 46:26.960
wasn't a zone of the enders game on the PSP I well more importantly than all of

46:26.960 --> 46:31.800
that there's going to be a Silent Hill collection which is silent hill two and

46:31.800 --> 46:35.600
three and it's just basically touched up to look good in HD and doesn't say

46:35.600 --> 46:39.520
what's going to be on although my assumption would be well ps3 and Xbox

46:39.520 --> 46:44.000
360 no maybe you can transfer to there too I don't know I'm gonna call it

46:44.000 --> 46:50.080
trans fart so that I can think of pooting noises whenever you do your

46:50.080 --> 46:54.080
trans farting well here's the thing the trans firing stuff the psycho mantis

46:54.080 --> 46:59.120
read my trans farted data it's not really a good feature anyways because

46:59.120 --> 47:06.080
the only game you can use that for would be the PSP port and peace Walker is the

47:06.080 --> 47:09.280
only game and I'm assuming you have to have the original game for that as well

47:09.280 --> 47:16.240
so I don't know that's kind of weird it does feel like a lot of wasted resources

47:16.240 --> 47:20.560
on something no one's going to use correct yeah and what I would think

47:20.560 --> 47:25.680
would be cool is that for those of us who have older ps3s it would be cool if

47:25.680 --> 47:28.680
there you know could be some way to transfer your save file but other than

47:28.680 --> 47:36.560
that you know that would be a pipe dream yeah I don't know did you guys watch

47:36.560 --> 47:41.480
Konami's press conference out of curiosity no here's the thing I I did

47:41.480 --> 47:46.400
watch most of it and what I thought was interesting most people were looking

47:46.400 --> 47:49.960
forward to Konami's press conference this year because the last couple years

47:49.960 --> 47:54.600
have just been an absolute fucking train wreck like it has just been like Konami

47:54.600 --> 47:57.920
it's just like like you know and I've used this reference before on the show

47:57.920 --> 48:00.640
but it's so true it's like the old episodes of the Ricky Lake show where

48:00.640 --> 48:04.440
she's just got her hand against her like uh and her jaw drop like I can't even

48:04.440 --> 48:07.880
control what's going on this stage right now is the show a hot mess yeah there

48:07.880 --> 48:10.840
was the year that they showed rock revolution and they failed the song on

48:10.840 --> 48:14.760
stage and then they had what last year the whole lucha libre thing wasn't that

48:14.760 --> 48:18.200
part of their thing and like it was just like what in the hell is going on in the

48:18.200 --> 48:25.160
hole what was it the one Marion troops and I I oh my god it was just it was

48:25.160 --> 48:29.000
just like what fucking train wreck thing is gonna happen now like it's Oprah's

48:29.000 --> 48:35.200
gonna come out and do bees everybody we got a game about bees hopefully you've

48:35.200 --> 48:38.480
all seen that gift from the Conan show this is the best thing ever made anyway

48:38.480 --> 48:43.440
um somebody in chat quick find me the Oprah bees gift because everybody needs

48:43.440 --> 48:46.800
to see it because that's what we were expecting at the Konami press conference

48:46.800 --> 48:53.000
this year was bees but no the whole thing was pre-recorded and it was a

48:53.000 --> 48:57.920
pre-recorded slickly produced video reel it was very reminiscent of for those

48:57.920 --> 49:02.040
that have seen the Konami booth at e3 they always have a giant television elite

49:02.040 --> 49:04.840
well last year they remodeled it I can't remember if they have the giant TV

49:04.840 --> 49:07.400
anymore but at least for the last few years before that they had a giant

49:07.400 --> 49:10.200
television that would cycle through all the trailers and people kind of sit and

49:10.200 --> 49:14.140
watch it was very reminiscent of this is the video that's gonna play on the giant

49:14.140 --> 49:21.400
TV all e3 which is which I found it you know what hey it was a interesting way

49:21.400 --> 49:24.640
for them to do it and you know they got their message out there and didn't

49:24.640 --> 49:28.200
really get made fun of and there's been a lot of hypes for the products I found

49:28.200 --> 49:32.440
it very interesting that they did it that way in part probably so that it was

49:32.440 --> 49:37.440
very scripted and would not fall apart alright here's my complaint and besides

49:37.440 --> 49:41.960
what Jamie's gonna talk about here in a second really is this all you've got

49:41.960 --> 49:46.440
you've got remakes of your old shit I is that it this is what you've worked hard

49:46.440 --> 49:52.640
on is well is taking assets from an old game and sprucing up sprucing up and hey

49:52.640 --> 49:55.640
you know you're not really playing a new game we're just taking the old game hold

49:55.640 --> 50:00.040
on hold on it up a bit and pumping it back into your console Kojima did come

50:00.040 --> 50:04.600
out to talk about a new about his new engine for a game they has no game for

50:04.600 --> 50:09.040
you know well here's the thing this is tricky though because maybe it's a game

50:09.040 --> 50:13.800
they're going to announce but did because of this whole pre three thing

50:13.800 --> 50:17.920
they didn't please just like you know they would announce it anyways if they

50:17.920 --> 50:23.360
were going to have something to announce because I mean seriously where's a you

50:23.360 --> 50:27.960
know no you're rising oh they mentioned that it's still coming to you next year

50:27.960 --> 50:32.600
even though they mentioned it two years ago last year I guess yay thank you to

50:32.600 --> 50:36.240
the four chatters that all found that at once for me the Oprah bees gift have you

50:36.240 --> 50:40.720
seen it Loki I'm afraid I have not seen my favorite fucking thing ever wait hold

50:40.720 --> 50:45.120
on oh there's a YouTube Ziba bless your heart

50:49.320 --> 50:52.440
ultimate Oprah's ultimate favorite things here we go

50:52.440 --> 51:01.580
nope I made a full screen here we go this is for you too they're opening the

51:01.580 --> 51:19.120
box and bees and they're playing them I'm a bee in the background and this is

51:19.120 --> 51:31.760
what we were expecting Konami's press conference this year was great I love

51:31.760 --> 51:34.320
having a live chat room more than anything because they can find shit like

51:34.320 --> 51:38.160
that for us on a whim and I don't care if it's a radio show and you can't see

51:38.160 --> 51:42.480
the video this is about my amusement and Oprah bees amuses me I have more Silent

51:42.480 --> 51:47.760
Hill me all right what well there was another announcement for a new Silent

51:47.760 --> 51:51.880
Hill title and it's called book of memories and it's gonna be for the

51:51.880 --> 51:59.240
vitamin the ps vitamin which is what I'm gonna call it the vitamin and they say

51:59.240 --> 52:04.000
that is going to be exclusive to the vitamin and it will be released quote

52:04.000 --> 52:08.120
later down the road after Silent Hill collection later down the road didn't

52:08.120 --> 52:13.080
even say what fuck if we know it's coming someday so you didn't even

52:13.080 --> 52:19.120
mention Silent Hill downpour at all they talked a little bit about dance dance

52:19.120 --> 52:24.120
revolution hey we got an arcade machine that's coming to Japan oh good oh you

52:24.120 --> 52:27.920
wanted something for you guys oh sorry we don't have anything for you we're

52:27.920 --> 52:31.360
telling you this because we know you'll import it anyway we don't even have Glee

52:31.360 --> 52:37.280
for you which is fine you know we don't care revolution Glee but I mean did they

52:37.280 --> 52:41.480
announce some of that stuff kind of just in written form only like a new DDR game

52:41.480 --> 52:44.520
is coming out to like it wasn't really in the video but they did put out a

52:44.520 --> 52:49.080
little paper on it well you know I didn't see a DDR game on there I didn't

52:49.080 --> 52:55.640
all I saw was you know x3 the arcade machine and that's it and yeah it's

52:55.640 --> 53:01.840
coming out in Japan so that that does not count I'm afraid I'm sorry so really

53:01.840 --> 53:04.960
what they're spending their time on doing is taking old shit and making it

53:04.960 --> 53:10.480
new again or not even making a new making it prettier great good job you

53:10.480 --> 53:13.240
know who can get away with that Sony can get away that cuz you know why cuz they

53:13.240 --> 53:18.840
put out new shit on top of that I again you said they put out I think you I I

53:18.840 --> 53:22.320
think it's too early to really say that because next week you know we have a new

53:22.320 --> 53:27.240
Nintendo console coming out you know Konami is working on something as oh I'm

53:27.240 --> 53:33.440
shaking waiting for the new elephants game it's gonna come out maybe it's okay

53:33.440 --> 53:36.040
and maybe another deck of sports game because you know there'll be another

53:36.040 --> 53:41.440
deck of sports game I'm done with you it's like deca sports and Ella bits

53:41.440 --> 53:46.840
maybe and what other crap did they put out whenever there's a new console hmm

53:46.840 --> 53:51.120
let me think here they don't put out Ella bits every time there's a new

53:51.120 --> 53:54.960
console that happened once on the Wii yeah but they're gonna totally bring it

53:54.960 --> 54:00.280
over you know it I don't think they will yeah that's right you just made sure me

54:00.280 --> 54:03.160
leave the room that's guys believe that's another Hudson title too anyway

54:03.160 --> 54:07.360
she's probably gonna go take a shit in the hall because of your outburst I'm

54:07.360 --> 54:11.640
just thank you for making my cat poop all right can we move on with another

54:11.640 --> 54:19.480
story please I guess I'm just saying it's it was not disappointing because I

54:19.480 --> 54:23.160
kind of expect this little out of them you know I was hoping they would

54:23.160 --> 54:29.760
surprise me but they might still know they're not come on this is Konami we're

54:29.760 --> 54:33.000
talking about here they are never gonna surprise us they're gonna just come out

54:33.000 --> 54:36.040
like almost want to bet money on this I'm doing the pie almost want to bet

54:36.040 --> 54:39.600
money on this but I'm not going to because I'm broke and I'm going to

54:39.600 --> 54:43.800
Disneyland this week and I need my money fine well just let's talk about

54:43.800 --> 54:47.240
something else all right there's a rumor that Microsoft's gonna be announcing a

54:47.240 --> 54:53.600
TV service at e3 basically kind of this whole rumor you know IP TV thing well

54:53.600 --> 54:57.680
now they're gonna kind of take it a step further and basically become their own

54:57.680 --> 55:01.560
you know service so instead of having you know dish or something like that you

55:01.560 --> 55:06.120
could have you know whatever we're gonna call this believe Xbox Live diamond

55:06.120 --> 55:09.400
they're saying is what's gonna be which is funny because I remember back in the

55:09.400 --> 55:15.720
day having the diamond card which gave me nothing but didn't it give you like

55:15.720 --> 55:19.160
discounts at Quiznos for like a month of something like that you know like I

55:19.160 --> 55:24.000
never used I never upgrade of a section sub to a footlong that was what PS

55:24.000 --> 55:30.560
diamonds those little like you know fundraising cards entertainment books

55:30.560 --> 55:33.960
not even that not even the entertainment book but you know it's a little like

55:33.960 --> 55:38.240
fundraising cards that you get that it's like oh this is for all the local

55:38.240 --> 55:43.040
businesses you know 10% off of a you know a Subway sandwich or four square

55:43.040 --> 55:49.200
well no not four square predating all of that I know I know it's hard to think of

55:49.200 --> 55:52.720
a time that I wore square didn't exist all I can think of is the entertainment

55:52.720 --> 55:55.920
books honestly there was the thing they'd sell them for like 35 bucks and

55:55.920 --> 55:59.560
all it was like buy one get one free yeah those are sold those and banned

55:59.560 --> 56:05.560
it's like I'm never gonna use all this I don't know um so before there was

56:05.560 --> 56:09.880
Groupon there was entertainment books uh yes so they're saying that it's gonna be

56:09.880 --> 56:13.240
for an additional monthly fee it's basically gonna be like a virtual cable

56:13.240 --> 56:21.160
operator and yeah so not really too much that we know or if it's even gonna be

56:21.160 --> 56:24.060
announced it would be kind of neat because honestly you know cables fucking

56:24.060 --> 56:29.760
expensive so if I can get something decent for you know cheaper okay but

56:29.760 --> 56:34.240
correct me if I wrong if net neutrality this whole thing about that the

56:34.240 --> 56:36.920
websites will soon be able to block whatever the I'm sorry internet

56:36.920 --> 56:40.380
providers will soon be able to be able to block whatever they want goes through

56:40.380 --> 56:44.520
um do you think Comcast is gonna have this they'll just be like a block

56:44.520 --> 56:49.720
unless Microsoft is somehow bought in to the providers and they kind of have done

56:49.720 --> 56:53.640
this with ESPN like when you connect to the ESPN it shows in the corner when I

56:53.640 --> 56:56.640
connect it says brought to you by Comcast like it knows what you're

56:56.640 --> 57:01.640
connecting to them through it's possible so either there's gonna be an agreement

57:01.640 --> 57:08.080
or this little TV network that they're doing might be their own set of channels

57:08.080 --> 57:13.400
like it's not gonna be tied to regular TV I mean do you remember about a year

57:13.400 --> 57:18.400
ago it had come out that before Conan signed the deal with TBS he had

57:18.400 --> 57:21.960
entertained the notion about doing a weekly show or a nightly show on Xbox

57:21.960 --> 57:25.640
Live have been awesome and that's why I think there's a lot of truth to this

57:25.640 --> 57:30.520
because I think Microsoft's been trying to build this for some time and they

57:30.520 --> 57:34.640
they have a similar service in UK although granted it's not their own

57:34.640 --> 57:37.960
channel so I don't know I don't know where it's gonna fall I think I think

57:37.960 --> 57:44.680
there absolutely will will be at least one new Microsoft channel in this and of

57:44.680 --> 57:52.640
course MSNBC this is what does MS stand for in MSNBC so at least those two

57:52.640 --> 57:57.320
channels but yeah I mean I don't if you get your cable internet through a cable

57:57.320 --> 58:01.640
provider your cable providers gonna be pissed that this whole thing is going on

58:01.640 --> 58:05.840
they'll try to stop it yeah and maybe even through nefarious purposes it'll be

58:05.840 --> 58:13.680
it'll be about bandwidth caps and all that garbage so we'll see anyhow other

58:13.680 --> 58:19.080
news about other things going on at e3 Q games is going to be showing three

58:19.080 --> 58:23.600
titles at e3 please note that they are this is not the same thing as Q

58:23.600 --> 58:27.960
entertainment I had actually made that mistake a little earlier on I thought

58:27.960 --> 58:31.440
this is about Q entertainment no Q games is the company that makes like pixel

58:31.440 --> 58:35.800
junk shooter and pixel they make all those games they are apparently they

58:35.800 --> 58:40.360
have like a preview online for one other pixel junk game and it was a little bit

58:40.360 --> 58:44.680
weird that title it was a pixel junk lifelike they had done a little preview

58:44.680 --> 58:50.400
of that apparently they are going to do two unannounced projects at e3 could

58:50.400 --> 58:57.120
they be more pixel junk games seems to be a lot of what they do now I bet one

58:57.120 --> 59:01.200
of them will be but one of them might be something a little new maybe for another

59:01.200 --> 59:05.760
console or something like that IDK but not the same as Q entertainment who

59:05.760 --> 59:11.320
makes luminous and and you know it's a rez and all that child of eden mizuguchi

59:11.320 --> 59:18.120
studio yeah different so there you go well we would move on to another story

59:18.120 --> 59:24.040
of dark soccer left the studio so let me just yell at Loki some more what are you

59:24.040 --> 59:29.840
yelling about how right I am but I was getting some dinner okay it's Dan made

59:29.840 --> 59:35.600
pasta Alfredo anyway well how about some sim stuff although this is not the

59:35.600 --> 59:38.960
cool type of sims news I wanted this actually makes me kind of sad but I'll

59:38.960 --> 59:42.920
go ahead and tell everybody there's going to be a new standalone game on

59:42.920 --> 59:52.440
Xbox 360 ps3 and the 3ds that is sims 3 pets and they said that it's going to be

59:52.440 --> 59:56.320
a standard expansion on the PC and Mac but I don't know if it's gonna be as

59:56.320 --> 01:00:03.280
awesome as what I'm hoping basically you can control your pets and you can breed

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.480
them and share them the Xbox 360 version will have Kinect capabilities you can

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:15.800
control the sims and their pets with voice commands and then he's like make

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.720
out and then they'll make out that type of thing but pets will for the 3ds will

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.460
have a pedometer so you get more karma points the more that you walk and you

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:30.520
can use it to buy in-game items and then with the street pass you can get pets to

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.080
other pets owners so there you go I'm just hoping that it I would rather that

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.600
for the PC one that it works a lot more like the old pets expansion did know you

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.280
have you can build your dog house and you can have your cat and you have to

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.680
clean up your cat's poo and that type of thing I'd make a big fat shirmy sounds

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:55.080
like fun well sims is for people who don't want to pay second life but you

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.520
know it's a lot more fun I don't know maybe they want to play second life by

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.720
themselves but like now I have to get generations if I want to play this one

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.600
it's RPM it's roleplay masturbation it's self-serving I'm kidding me the

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.960
odds of the Sims is what the still the best-selling PC game ever right pretty

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.960
much I don't even think Wow beat it so there you go all right let's travel the

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.680
world and look at some release dates if you don't want to get the Sims maybe

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.360
there's something else coming out to a store near you very soon this week

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:27.960
garbage like that if you know that's your thing then cool what other garbage

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.280
do they have here Duke Nukem critical mass but that's not actually coming out

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.720
at that time Oh Green Lantern of course there's a movie tie-in game for that

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.240

Phantom Breaker in a limited edition red faction Armageddon and riot act 2 goes

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.360
into the platinum collection so that is also getting a price reduction riot act

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.640
2 is crackdown

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.240
what's their version of crackdown moving on to other consoles such as the

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:48.200
PlayStation 3 red faction Armageddon there as well real got to cool comes out

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.520
of the end is what that's called that is coming out on the ninth from Sega this

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.840
is a Yakuza zombie game

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.480
yeah that looks pretty cool could be interesting

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.880
are they bringing that over here I don't know it's not been announced yet so Yakuza

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.920
zombies maybe that's something you'll see any three next week localized

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:14.480
version of that on the Nintendo Wii nothing on the 3ds though fish on comes

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.560
out this week you guessed it it's a fishing game and it's 3d yay I would

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.400
have never guess it's a fishing game and lastly on the Sony PSP really not a lot

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.040
this week there's another even galleon limited edition thing it's a patchy game

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.240
trashy so I'm thinking that is what another Pachinko Evangelion game looking

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.720
at the screenshots another yeah it's like a little slot machine little

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.720
gambling games little mini games gambling slots that because there's a

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:51.440
revamped Evangelion series out so of course it's been getting big side

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.600
product reboot so there you go that's it does it for your Japanese releases in the

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.520
UK we have a few things we have on the 7th Super Street Fighter 4 arcade

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:06.560
edition and it will be out in the arcade Xbox 360 and ps3 on the 8th we have

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:12.240
Beyond Good and Evil HD and then on the 10th we have Arcana Hearts 3 infamous 2

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.680
Red Faction Armageddon White Knight Chronicles 2 and Duke Nukem forever

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:27.880
that's it forever and ever and stuff and ever did Loki just break in the song I

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.320
think you did a little bit I said never this is suddenly playing out like an

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:38.480
episode of Glee all right Loki so I almost made me gag on my food Rob thank

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.640
you tell me Loki what's going on what's going on what's going on as we have

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.200
rumors about the Wii successor this is stuff that we've all kind of heard about

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:57.560
before this is coming from Nikkei and this is basically the same publication

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:03.400
that also predicted the DSI to DSI excel the 3ds now they're predicting stuff for

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:08.440
the new Wii console or new Nintendo console apparently they are saying that

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.320
it's coming out on the let the second half of 2012 obviously fourth quarter

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.560
makes sense and that it will also have you the six inch touchscreen on the

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.440
controller yeah they are basically repeating what everybody else has been

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.040
saying and also apparently there is supposed to be having some sort of

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:33.480
camera on the actual controller as well they're saying that the company

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.520
omnivision who's working with Apple on its iPhone I'm supplying them with

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:46.160
cameras is also apparently supplying a Nintendo with cameras as well so

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:53.760
interesting that they're gonna do that and there was one other rumor that

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.880
didn't make our show roll because it was very very very last-minute but the

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:07.080
rumor is that Nintendo's next console might be called Nintendo that's right

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.800
that's how much effort they're putting into their console they don't even want

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.880
to fucking name it I you know what I actually don't think it's that terrible

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.400
the name I think there was a rumor that the Wii was gonna be called that that

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.080
it's just the Nintendo that whole reboot idea I I actually don't think it's a

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.440
terrible idea because you know if you go back to when all we had was the Nintendo

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.120
it was like hey you want to come over to my house and play Nintendo it was just

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:39.280
it became like a verb you know what I mean like Xeroxing Kleenex one of those

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.300
types of things so calling it the Nintendo Nintendo I don't think it's a

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:51.760
terrible name I could see like Nintendo HD or something like that I think most

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.080
people's reaction will be oh okay but I don't think you can say that's a bad

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:01.560
name if to be fair the original Nintendo was really called the Nintendo

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:05.520
Entertainment System yeah so if they're calling this just the Nintendo it is a

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.720
new name but I don't I actually don't believe it I I think because to call the

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.960
system your company when you're trying to also launch a 3ds thing side-by-side

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.080
I actually don't buy it I would I would give more credit to like Nintendo HD or

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:31.280
Nintendo with a very small suffix to it mm-hmm so let's see Randy in our term

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.160
says not Nintendo the Nintendo Rama says the next console called Nintendo I

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.520
fucking called that two weeks ago dude you gotta wait till Tuesday for you get

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.960
to parade that salacious pop to play Nintendo is still relevant vernacular in

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.440
my opinion so if they want to make a play on that it's not that surprising

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.520
that's kind of where I'm at my mom still calls it all Nintendo when I showed her

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.880
Mortal Kombat she was like oh you're gonna fire up the Nintendo okay maybe

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:05.480
not like that but you know she saw the same to her so we'll see anyhow one of

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.000
the story I want to get to you before we get to the classic game of the week and

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.520
this is important this has to do with of course fundraising efforts that are

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.080
still going on for Japanese tsunami relief guys it doesn't fix itself

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.080
overnight this fundraising effort is going to go on for years and years you

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.560
know again not to bring up really bad memories of the past but when hurricane

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.120
Katrina happened that took years to clean up and some would argue there's

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.600
still cleanup efforts that go on to this day so you know Japan is still in need

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.640
of help for tsunami relief and I think this is a great I love this gamers doing

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.320
good stuff stories play for Japan is going to be an album that is going to be

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.520
coming out we've talked about it a few times on the show before the track list

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.160
was announced this week that's the new news just going over some of the cool

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.000
things that are going to be on here there's original songs here a kiriyama

Tommy Tallarico greater lights so it's not just folks in Japan but it's Western

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:17.960
composers as well it's it's gonna be a great lineup so watch the the thing that

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.840
a kiriyama mocha was talking I did not watch the video I do have it here but

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.320
did you watch it yes it is what you think really good I mean what was in it

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:32.120
just talking about you know working with people from all over the world that

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.680
worked in the the industry specifically related to music and getting some of the

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.320
best things out there and that everything was going towards Japan relief

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.360
I mean it was it was really just thanking people involved and thinking

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.040
people to buy it and saying hey for all of you following us we recognize we have

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.240

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:12.240
iTunes store so I mean you know argue if you will if you hate Apple or whatever

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.240
but it is a huge store gonna be very easy and what I like about it is that I

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.520
remember a time three years ago it was very hard to find video game music on

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.280
iTunes now it seems like it's really broken through and it's pretty easy to

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:26.120
find a lot of the newer soundtracks on there so uh props to iTunes who

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.960
hopefully will be featuring that so that'll be available for sale again a

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.960
hundred percent of the proceeds going to the Japanese Red Cross play for Japan

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:38.520
org let's get into the classic game of the week every week here on the show

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.080
we'd like to highlight a game from gaming's past dark soccer likes to jump

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:49.800
into the vault and say hey look while you're talking about your newfangled

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:56.040
Nintendo's of the present I remember Nintendo's back in my day back when we

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:03.560
played awesome games such as this one yes bionic commando for the NES and I

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.160
could have gone over bionic commando the arcade version but I didn't because it's

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:15.120
not as great in Japan it was known as Hitler no Fuka Fukatsu top secret which

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:21.720
means the resurrection of Hitler top secret and it's kind of based off of the

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.640
87 bionic commando this one came out in 88 you basically have to explore

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:33.840
different stages and you play as lad Spencer who is going to rescue the guy

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:41.320
from the first game who was called Super Joe who was captured by the Empire you've

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.680
got to go stop the Empire of the the the general of the Imperial forces and who

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:55.280
is completing the project himself so you have to go and rescue Super Joe and lead

01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:02.220
the FF battalion or double force battalion who were all commandos who use

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:07.560
wired guns rescue him so you've got a stage select map and you move around the

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:13.440
map screen and you can choose to move to different areas but you have to go back

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.760
and go through these overhead areas to get to different places there's 19 areas

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:24.560
in the game 1 through 12 or combat and 13 and 19 are all neutral areas where

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:32.100
you can't fight at all the if you fire your weapon at all in those areas you'll

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:36.640
be attacked by key peacekeeping force and but these are places where that you

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:42.180
can get information and items there's also green enemy trucks on the map

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:46.860
selection that will try to block your helicopter and if you fly into one of

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.220
these while you're traveling you have to battle the troops and this is the

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:56.940
overhead part oh it's like you know it's kind of like commando so you can

01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:02.360
actually kill certain enemies to get additional continues so you've got a

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.840
bionic arm so you can't jump you just use the arm and you latch on and can

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:14.460
swing yourself at 45 degrees or you can go up or exactly right so you've got

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.880
different ways that you can move but it's really just those three ways you

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.280
can also use the arm to deflect some bullets and grab different enemies and

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:29.040
items and then you also get to communicate with your forces to get

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:35.000
information and you can tap into the enemy communication although sometimes

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.160
they will send a squadron to attack you if they detect you and sometimes you get

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.720
bullets from killing people because whenever I shoot somebody I get bullets

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:53.160
so at any rate there were clearly changes that were made to the game as

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.040
you can probably tell from the Japanese title the whole thing was basically

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:04.600
about fighting Nazis the Empire was like a neo-nazi nation and they used a

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:11.440
swastika for their logo so of course when it came out over here they changed

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.600
the logo and everything and they changed you know things to the Imperial forces

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:21.200
and blah blah although the end boss still looks like Hitler but they call

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:28.680
him master D like hi we kind of know who that is except you do get to see his

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:34.120
head explode which is pretty cool because he was a fuckhead yeah and I got

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.280
to say Tiger Claw in the charm says this is this game is from an era before the

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.080
ESRB so they were able to get away with some gore on an NES game that was just

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.320
because the ESRB that was Nintendo's own policy to get rid of the gore but yeah

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.400
heads exploding you didn't see that in many games no and it was a gory ass

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:55.360
explosion I mean it was like everywhere so yeah there have been other remakes

01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:01.280
there was a portable version of bionic commando on the Gameboy in 1992 that was

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:07.720
based off of the NES game but it was turned into a futuristic one because

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.220
this was actually set in the 80s when it was made in the 80s and then there was

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:19.640
of course bionic commando rearmed that was developed by grin and it came out in

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:25.680
night in 2008 for PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and the sequel that came out

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:32.880
February 2011 and then the original NES bionic commando was featured on a game

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.560
boy advanced compilation is club Capcom classics mini mix which also included

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.960
Strider and mighty final fight two really good games well maybe not in a

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:48.680
strider but still so uh there's also a book a novel ization that was based off

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:53.200
of an S version so the main characters called Jack Marx and he lost his arm

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.380
when ninjas attacked his hotel room and kidnapped Super Joe so they replaced it

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:01.800
sounds like a Michael Bay movie no they replaced it with a bionic limb with a

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.720
grappling hook and other neato things so there's different things you know the

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:13.120
book was super toned down and they didn't kill anybody although certain

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:21.040
things like some of the deaths of Hal and kilt are kept in and they just sort

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.360
of skim over most of the stuff that goes on so they can fit the book and there's

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:32.000
an illustrated bionic commando story actually on a website that I will be

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.840
linking in the chat room and if you're not in a chat room oh well too bad so

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.600
here you can find out about Super Joe and about spencer alright there it is

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:50.360
your classic game of the week bionic commando for the NES not to be confused

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.640
with the arcade version or a Ziba keeps asking about in the chat room the

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.360
Commodore 64 version which I don't even remember playing but I'm pretty sure it

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.160
was based off the arcade more than was the NES speaking of which you did see

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:06.940

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.080
because Bobby is helping us with those e3 wrap-up shows he's gonna be telling

like mostly his shows probably think about it but no we'll be here given our

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.080
smart ass commentary but I do want to say about Bobby speaking of Twitter if

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:07.400
you're not following Bobby on Twitter you should be because he's kind of doing

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.520
he's he's biting an idea we did a couple years ago but with permission we told

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.640
me good that is you drive him on the show floor he is very minimal

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.440
appointments so if you're like Bobby I heard this game might be on the show

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:25.400
floor and nobody's covering it he'll go find out for you so all that stuff that

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:29.280
used to be in Kensha Hall that's now kind of sprinkled throughout the East

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.120
Halls and West Halls he'll go find that stuff for you I need to know what not to

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.320
miss putting out so there right now there's the first moon game but there's

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:45.120
seriously Twin Cities or Twin Town yes we we demand that Bobby goes to Natsume's

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:51.160
booth finds the largest chibi thing that they have on display in the booth and

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:56.000
get a picture with it it's harvest moon come on it's always harvest moon no one

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.280
year they had the the tulip game they were showing the game was great and it

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.600
always come out you run up and kiss people it did come out as a GameStop

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:12.560
exclusive but um I want I don't want a cow I want cow swag from the harvest moon

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.000
people I have like a pig from them I have a sheep somewhere have their pig

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:28.720
but I want a handsome I don't want a pig it's not kosher should I get on to rapid

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:34.880
fire news yes please sir okay resistance tool pack is coming out July 5th it is

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:39.720
basically resistance one and two for one low price plus you get a few extra skins

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:46.920
and why not you get a multiplayer skin that's the Capelli skin and also you're

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:55.160
also getting some maps as well the aftermath map pack in skin bundle with

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.560
the race skin multiplayer skin for resistance to offer 40 bucks you know I

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.400
actually may pick this up because I sold back resistance one a while ago and I

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.120
never really finished resistance to before I sold back and I'm really

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:14.640
looking forward to number three so I have to pick it up again pretty cool so

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.920
also this is kind of interesting because usually you hear about these type of

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:23.280
things when people are doing their own kind of portable console mods but they're

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:29.440
actually selling portable Dreamcast now these are not necessarily I think

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:36.120
official you know Dreamcast items actually sanctioned by Sega or something

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:44.400
but it's actually a portable system it's gonna go for 38,000 yen or you're

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:52.080
roughly four hundred and seventy dollars u.s. and that's kind of crazy it does

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:57.320
look something looks like something like Ben Heck would put out I mean very

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:03.720
vacuum formed shell and whatnot but uh yeah if you're really interested in

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.160
portable Dreamcast seriously you're better off building your own because it

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:16.120
be way cheaper way cheaper and then finally if you wanted to pick up the you

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.040
draw and you don't own a Wii you can now do that because it'll be coming on 360

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.520
and PlayStation 3 HD you draw HD you draw it's getting it's kind of some

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.680
enhancements it's going to be a multi-touch tablet it's going to have a

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:36.600
high-definition input 2,000 by 1600 resolution and you know you'll be able

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.880
to do the pinch and stretch rotation area HD it's a built-in tilt sensors now

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.480
you can draw penises in HD and what I of course will be coming with you draw

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.200
studio or it's in this case is going to be kind of a souped-up you draw studio

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.720
you draw studio instant artists with tutorials and a new interface and stuff

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.160
like that of course there's gonna be supporting the different you draw titles

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.200
like Pictionary and that kind of thing I don't know it's kind of interesting just

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:10.040
from what I've seen with you draw on the Wii the support ports kind of a because

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.160
it's only teach cute and stuff out and now I know that we heard rumors that

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.680
maybe Nintendo might put something out for you know everyone's hoping for Mario

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:23.600
Paint but I don't know that's that's a stretch I think but at least teach who's

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.360
supporting it they've got you know the Wii I want to say there's about five

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:34.320
games out for now so it's not bad Frisbee in our term says get a real tablet dark

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.720
Tetsuya says hey look at it this way the Bob Ross game lives on you can paint

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.000
happy little trees but let's be real they're all drawing penises with it by

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.520
the way one thing I forgot to mention about that Duke Nukem forever demo

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.800
there's a whiteboard in it that seems to exist for no other reason than for

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.640
twelve-year-olds to draw penises on it yep and then the the onlookers will

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.480
commentate oh that sounds like a good plan Duke you can draw a wiener on it

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:03.000
and I'm not talking about that was done in a video for the demo I guess it was

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.840
time to penis we have not asked that question in a very long time but

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.680
whenever there is a new peripheral announced you always have to ask the

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.400
question how long before someone either draws a dick on it or puts their dick

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:21.440
in it real you draw time to replace five seconds it'll be the first thing many

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:28.000
people draw that wiener I think it'd be cool though if they did you know but

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.320
they really need a new magic pen Jo game seriously that would be awesome break

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:42.720
man in our chat room says 3d vaginas are ugly yeah I saw Cloverfield to anything

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.120
else that's it oh hey then let's get to more news Michael J Fox is going to be

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.960
in the back to the future games yeah that's pretty cool because he wasn't in

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:56.240
the first few but they are going to bring him back for the fifth and I guess

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.240
the last game in the back to the future of course these are the telltale games

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.040
episodic now here's the thing they are not going to just simply replace AJ

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.880
Laskio who's been doing the voice and apparently doing a very good job Michael

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:12.440
J Fox is going to be in the conclusion the rumor is that he's one of McFly's

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.480
ancestors so yeah it's not a rumor that's actually they have video of it

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.360
okay so I guess the video came out between the story I'm reading and now so

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.600
yeah that's cool though that they've been able to work him in like that I

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.880
think that's really cool you know a lot of people been talking about that new

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.280
x-men movie and apparently it's really good it is I haven't seen it yet it's

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.480
really good it's way better than three three is poop three didn't happen this

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:41.500
movie is really good are there any good one-liners like do you know what

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:45.080
lightning what happens when lightning hits a toad no but my favorite line in

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.840
the whole movie is fuck off and you'll know what I'm talking about when you see

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.560
it all right you got it but here's the thing uh as far as the x-men goes the

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.960
reason why I bring it up and I forget why I bring it up why did I bring it up

01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.180
oh yeah we were talking about Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were originally

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:05.560
supposed to have a cameo in it as I guess playing and you know the older

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.920
versions kind of like they did in the original x-men movie but they cut it or

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.080
they didn't film it and nixed it because they didn't want the new x-men movie

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.480
tied to the original at all but I thought that was kind of sad because

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.920
Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen like oh my god they could read the phone book

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:24.520
and I would just be like yes tell me more and they kind of epitomize the

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:29.240
characters that they played I mean they really did is professor Xavier of course

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.720
Patrick Stewart can play anybody and he would but I that person I hear the new

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:37.520
kids are really good too like just as younger versions they do a good job I

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.080
think they did a good job but but it's just like oh my god if somebody tried to

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.800
play a young captain Jean-Luc Picard like I don't think I'd ever be able to

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.640
believe it I tried to do that seriously he's right they did oh that's right

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:55.480
they did yeah seriously how fucking annoying is it that he picked Arnold

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:59.640
Schwarzenegger be mr. freeze over Patrick Stewart it would have been perfect oh

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.400
perfect give me started but no you know what it's a good thing Patrick Stewart

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.240
stayed away yeah you know what it would have killed him I mean seriously it

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.400
would've been real Julia all over again all right hey la noir which is a game

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.360
that Loki's loaning me I'm very excited I can take it out of my queue la noir

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.920
has got some download content that's gonna be coming out DLC is gonna come

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:24.080
what may 17th all the way through July 12th and there's DLC cases that you can

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.120
download one of them's called reefer madness I don't think it plays into the

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.720
movie but hey the naked city let's hope we see some more nude people yeah that's

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.040
coming out of May 31st for four bucks anyway if you want to buy all this stuff

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:41.960
a la carte you can pay $20 for it but you can also pre buy all of it for ten

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:46.480
bucks with what's called the rock star pass but you have until June 14th to

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:50.240
take advantage of that otherwise it's going up to twelve dollars after that so

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.840
there you go lots of stuff coming out that there's even I guess challenges a

01:30:54.840 --> 01:31:00.240
new suits and guns and whatever horse armor but also some the social social

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:08.280
club things may 17th interesting stuff so la noir DLC speaking of download

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:13.600
stuff and all this stuff Capcom has reversed a decision we reported on no

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:16.560
actually we didn't report on this last week because I think we weren't here so

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.960
Capcom did take that DRM maybe this what I've seen you remember talking about it

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:23.640
so it was a couple weeks ago that this annoying DRM was going to be in Super

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.760
Street Fighter 4 on the PC that if you are not connected to the internet it

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.560
won't bork the game but you'll be limited to 15 fighters and of course

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:36.000
people raised hell on the forums and Capcom said okay okay we're back and

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.320
down yeah you we will be able to play as everybody even if not connected to the

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.360
internet however as one would logically as expect you won't have online

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.760
multiplayer replay sharing or watching and achievements unless you're online

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.600
and logged in which yeah that does make sense I think so there you go the

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:02.320
consumers win I think moving on we do have other news there is a Final Fantasy

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:08.800
5 rated by the ESRB for a PSN release in North America which is pretty good so

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.520
we'll be getting lots of classic games and hopefully it's going to have the

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:19.000
same treatment that uh that three in those had you know then we have Duke

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Nukem forever download content details we have the first download pack that has

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.920
four weapons a minigun a new tube a sticky grenade and a BFG which we all

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:37.480
know what BFG stands for DLC number two is a deathmatch maps there's EDF base

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:42.800
LKR and map three it's just called map three and then the third pack is 15 new

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:49.120
single-player maps arm wrestling and the impregnator weapon and a karaoke machine

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.160
so hey also if you've pre-ordered the game you get the first DLC for free and

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.600
then the last news is in Batman Arkham City you can play as Catwoman and she

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.040
gets her own storyline she better not be played by Halle Berry she looks pretty

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.880
hot don't get me wrong Halle Berry is hot but that movie not hot no but she

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:13.240
looks pretty hot that's it nice all right let's get into what some Twitter

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.640
topics now yeah that's right twitter.com slash olr and every week you guys can

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:22.960
send us your tweets show us your tweets as we like to say and we read them as

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:31.200
long as they don't suck well let's start off Twitter this week with Oh Fiedelt61

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:34.160
tweeted us this and I don't think we actually covered this elsewhere on the

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.840
show trek movie.com reports that a video game set in the Star Trek movie universe

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.560
is coming in 2012 our soccer did you hear about this it seems right up your

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:48.840
alley Star Trek online it's gonna be set in the Abrams Trek universe I'm

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.240
assuming to maybe bridge the new movie because the new movies out next year too

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.480
right it is I thought they were targeting 2012 anyway well anyway it's

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.680
gonna be an original story an unprecedented co-op experience players

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:09.920
can play as Kirk and Spock so now you can be ZQ it's gonna be its own story

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.880
continues the adventure of the Star Trek movie the press release that was

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.480
released says that the game is filled with action-packed combat as Kirk and

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.960
Spock must work together to stop a legendary enemy race bent on conquering

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:27.800
the galaxy the story is being written by Mary Ann Kraswick she wrote for God of

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:32.460
War and she's a BAFTA Award winner and the writer producers of the new Star

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:38.640
Trek films so I imagine this will bridge things this is also the first full Star

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:43.920
Trek video game since 2007 they are not counting Star Trek online but they would

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:49.040
say that Star Trek conquest the game that came out from Bethesda because

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:56.360
that's what most people said about it it will be coming out in 2012 I I'll check

01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:02.360
it out heck yeah I like Star Wars enough or Star Trek well I have an all tab open

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:08.800
with the Star Wars story that's coming later my bad Essex 22 tweeted us and

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.000
said just curious what you guys might consider the best downloadable co-op ps3

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.640
title want to find something a friend and I can play online any suggestions

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:25.360
best co-op downloadable title I would suggest on review I miss what's that

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:29.860
portal to you PC yeah I don't think you can download that though PC download it

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:35.520
for ps3 I would say Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light is a heck of a lot of

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:38.920
fun it's kind of like an arcade game but you could do the co-op mode that was fun

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.680
I had a lot of fun playing co-op in that that would be my suggestion assuming you

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:46.300
don't like already have it on 360 or steam I would definitely check out at

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:49.680
least the demo for the Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light I'm actually

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:53.840
really looking forward to that new Tomb Raider game I gotta say because you know

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.720
the the download title made me interested in Tomb Raider again and I

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.880
kind of like the direction they're going in with a new one the new trailers pretty

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.360
hot Loki I don't know if you mess around too much with co-op games online but

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.320
anything you can think of that might downloadable it's hard because I'm not

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:17.840
sure what type of games you really like and ps3 is also kind of limited with I

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.680
mean not as much stuff jumps to mind like they don't have quake 3 arena they

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.680
don't have in the kind of the same selection have perfect dark and some of

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.680
the same stuff that the Xbox does the pixel junk games are insanely popular I

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.200
would check those out too so things to think about more tweets coming to us

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:42.160
from the bacon bits tweeted us with something the Nintendo controller

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:48.480
spotted at e3 but then when I bring this up in a new window I'm like this is

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.360
somebody trying to be lolsy I think because what this is a picture of is I

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:58.720
think it's just an N 64 controller all taped up yeah somebody just posted an N

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.360
64 controller I think we'll see there although that would be kind of funny if

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:07.960
they just use the 64 controller all over again but I kind of doubt it

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:12.920
spasminator tweets us usual drill free TV shows on the PSN store also there's

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.280

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.800
been kinda inundated ever since PlayStation Network came back up which

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.320

like it's not related to your job these are the games you're gonna be selling at

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.040
Christmas time I think you do have a right to watch this at work problem is

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:18.280
they let go so many people it's like I stupid Nazis don't let me know I'll just

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.960
lock the door what they're gonna do lock the door I'll lock the door to the

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.160
conference room we're gonna be watching on nice HGTV there you go

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:30.840
act deft tweets us what game or gaming related news would truly surprise you if

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.200
it happened on e3 this week now we are gonna get into e3 predictions a little

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.240
later but I'm gonna allow this question because it's not talking about what do

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.360
you think will happen this is talking about what would surprise you if it

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:47.560
happened is there anything that would truly surprise you if it happened Sony

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:54.040
doesn't fuck up that surprised me the f-zero game on the Nintendo console I

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:58.080
don't think it's gonna happen so I would say it would genuinely surprise me I

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.320
would be tickled pink when I go down there on Thursday to pick up Bobby I

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:11.080
might just have to rush the doors if the f-zero game happens there's not really

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.320
much that could be surprising to me I like so I'm going in the route to this

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:21.880
with really low expectations it's so hard to call things like that too

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.040
because when I think of like surprises I think of things that literally come the

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.800
fuck out of nowhere like I would say Gabe Newell getting up on stage at the

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.840
Sony press conference and saying hey by the way I don't hate Sony anymore and

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:38.120
we're gonna integrate steam in the PlayStation that was a fucking surprise

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:43.240
like and that I I couldn't have called that I don't think anyone could have and

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:49.040
Final Fantasy 14 as lolsy as that came up as that was two years ago let us not

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.160
forget when Jack Trenton was on stage and said we're gonna be delivering Final

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.480
Fantasy 14 everybody was like oh he just fucked up he meant 13 too and no it was

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.600
fucking 14 was coming out already even though really was 11 but you know yeah

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:09.040
11 HD surprises are so hard to foresee um I would say like a very strange

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.880
partnership especially from Microsoft and I know that's so vague I know the

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:21.560
return of Xbox live experience is like 1 versus 100 I sadly think that shit is

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.840
gone which pisses me off I think it was a great thing that they had but if if

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.480
they were to say hey we're bringing back the multiplayer game show type events

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:35.320
the live events on Xbox that would truly surprise me

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:42.680
where the fuck are my Burger King Kinect games Burger King Kinect part 2 that

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:46.840
would be your no they Burger King Kinect part 1 where the hell are they they

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:51.680
were they promised me that they're gonna have some exclusive Burger King King

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:57.440
Kinect games and I have yet to see these I was already the Bible because they

01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.600
were gonna be terrible I know the Nintendo console projects imagery any

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.720
type of projector built into the Nintendo that would fucking surprise me

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:10.040
because that is not happening the holodeck the holidays holodeck announced

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.560
and it's coming to you from on live because nobody believed that shit would

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:20.760
work either and look there it is on life presents the holodeck alright I don't

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.720
want to miss these tweets from Tiger claw let me get to these top gun in days

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.440
of thunder to get blu-ray game slash movie combos did you hear about that

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.600
they're selling yeah I know packs I've been selling those have you really

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.240
known about that for a while and they sound lame it's no it's seriously it's

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.400
lame here's here's what they're doing they're doing basically what they did

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.160
with the Watchmen where they take the really shitty shitty PlayStation Network

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.460
games that sold like garbage and then they throw it in with the movie so

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:51.360
that's what you're gonna get you're gonna get the really shitty garbage top

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.240
gun game and the really terrible you know days of Thunder game awesome hey at

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.640
least you get a movie I gotta read this comment in chat guys you don't our

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.280
term says big brother on Xbox live arcade would be awesome if they don't

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.840
make it I will I've got to say this I was walking through Target and I saw

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:15.100
their Wii section of games and excuse me strawberry part um I saw for sale on the

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:19.320
Wii the survivor game that's now available on the Wii and look I'm a fan

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.600
of reality trash TV and I do watch almost every episode survivor stuff and

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.580
I picked up this box I just started laughing at how horrible this game

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.720
looked now have you seen the amazing race for the week I've heard that's

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.360
garbage too oh I'm sure it is but I mean like actually a survivor game or

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:40.560
something like that on Xbox live arcade in the party thing or whatever might not

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.720
suck if they do it right it could actually be really fucking interesting

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:49.740
but I just don't trust anyone to get it right because I look at this stuff

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:54.480
that's on the Wii and I'm like oh the Wii game shows that work best are the

01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:00.040
minimalist ones like Wheel of Fortune that's pretty hard to fuck up jeopardy

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:05.800
again pretty hard to fuck up pressure luck no whammies no whammies stop I mean

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.760
somehow game show network fucked it up when they revived it but you know what I

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:15.000
mean classic pressure luck is still gold anyhow also from Tiger Claw penny arcade

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.880
comic to be adapted into a movie I had not heard about this have you heard

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:23.960
anything about this yeah it's a spin-off it's just basically what else is the

01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.040
games didn't work out so well no it's not even a spin it's it's like a little

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:33.720
three panel comic that they did the story of the Divx player no it's not

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.160
even it's none of the penny arcade characters it's basically this kid who

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:42.000
is the new kid the new kid yeah he's moving it you know normally it's moving

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.040
to a new town well it's moving to a new planet and the planet has three-quarters

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.020
of the gravity that you know they had on earth or whatever and so I'm guessing

01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.360
he's kind of like you know super strong and fast or whatever because you know

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.200
you would be if you went to a planet with less gravity well the guys but

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.840
everyone else would too you know no no if they grew up on that planet though

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.240
it'd be they wouldn't be super strong or fast or whatever they would be adapted

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.040
to that gravity where it's like it'd be just like you know for example if you

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.820
had leg weights and you're running with leg weights all the time you take them

01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:14.200
off and they'll sudden you know you feel your logic there yeah I would question

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.040
how much are the penny arcade people gonna actually be involved in this

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.280
because they are pretty good writers and they write some really funny hilarious

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.400
insightful comments and they their commentary on gaming culture has always

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.320
been really good but then I read in this story here Paramount has tapped Gary

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.640
Witte a former PC gamer editor-in-chief and book of Eli screenwriter to pen the

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.660
new kid and I roll my eyes this has nothing to do with the penny arcade

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:38.680
comic it just it happens to be this is a comic that they also made okay none of

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.540
the characters are in it now the funny stuffs in I get that but I'm saying the

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:44.440
penny arcade comic proves that they're good writers and I would like to see

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.080
what they it's just like okay the South Park you know Trey and Matt are fucking

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.720
hilarious I want to see the Book of Mormon play on that alone like it has

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.560
nothing to do and I realized that that universe the South Park have nothing in

01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.320
common except recurring Mormon jokes over and over but I want to see that

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.440
play based on the fact that I appreciate their work on the show and I think

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.880
they're very good satirists that's what I'm getting at does that make sense

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.820
oh all right and how that does it for tweets tonight twitter.com slash olr

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.600
send us more tweets for next week or send your tweets over to Bobby because

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:21.600
he's gonna be roaming the halls of e3 and he is your little eyebo that you can

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.560
command to go look at things and by the way he did accept the challenge of going

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.480
to find the giant stuffed animal at the Natsume booth and he will get chibi

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:35.200
wolf and a cow by the way you're not getting in the car to Disneyland without

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:43.960
swag for dark Sakura and sky probably Dan too no just for me all right let's

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.360
I'm giving him such a hard time all right let's move on more news plenty

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.600
more news and the mailbag and our e3 predictions just around the corner yes

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:59.240
so Activision not to lose out on a money-making opportunity they have

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:05.160
decided to create Call of Duty elite it is a paid digital platform being created

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:11.760
by beachhead studios built around right now modern warfare 3 and now the service

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:17.320
does have free aspects to it and this would include also like you know you

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:24.320
know guild making and you know you know sharing videos and that kind of stuff it

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.400
also you know tracks your stats you know very think of it like the halo waypoint

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:35.920
almost a little bit they have of course I guess they're saying part of the fee

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.320
will go towards a customer service operation that needs I guess that their

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.200
supporting the back and forth so they're saying you know it's gonna have a small

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:50.760
monthly fee and maybe like eight bucks or something and I don't know it just it

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:56.560
sounds interesting I guess you know especially since you know a lot of the

01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.840
players for Call of Duty are really just online heavy it's really community

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.660
driven so it makes sense that they would be doing something like this also it's a

01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:08.000
way for them to sell more you know subscriptions and make money and what

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.680
not make every month off of World of Warcraft from Blizzard how could we make

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:17.360
money every month offer other big games yeah why bother having them you know

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:23.920
share videos on YouTube for free when they can do it on our service and we

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.360
could just take down all the videos on YouTube well I don't think they would do

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.200
that but and I think a lot of its you know still free but they have like a

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.880
video out there that you can check out that has kind of some of the you know

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:41.080
features of it and stuff it sounds a little bit also I don't know if anyone

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:46.680
remembers because it's been around for at least a few months now since Medal of

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:54.120
Honor but remember there's also the EA's gun club or whatever so they've got you

01:48:54.120 --> 01:49:00.880
know that kind of thing as well going on on the EA side so yeah I guess I don't

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.240
know it makes sense that they're kind of doing this sort of stuff and I'm sure

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:06.960
they're gonna have like you know betas for you know paid members and stuff like

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:10.040
that just a way to get people it kind of think of it like the PlayStation Plus

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:15.800
program or something like that I don't know if you're hardcore that it's worth

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.560
it to you well even for those of us that don't get it quote unquote we just go

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.760
lol more money well even if you don't like for example if you're not that

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:30.640
hardcore into it though you know you can at least get some stuff out of the you

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:35.400
know the free free portion of it like they haven't you like your career stats

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.640
or all that stuff if you like the stat tracking and I think they even have the

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:44.440
the hot points on the map and stuff where most of the players are you know

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:49.360
converging on and stuff like that so I don't know it check out the free portion

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.480
if you if it's not for you then you don't have to do it it's simple as that

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.840
you know we were talking a lot on Horde house today about $25 amounts and Wow

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.440
and why people buy them and you know it some of us look at it and go why in the

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:06.280
hell would you spend that money on them out but for some people it's like pretty

01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:12.520
Barbie you know so you can't it's your money spending on whatever you want hey

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:18.080
some details on the 3ds shop launch excite bike 3d is gonna be the free game

for 30 days I'm sure that will be fantastic in 3d I'm sure it will fully

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:50.120
utilize the power of the 3ds goddamn NES game which is the the layers that's what

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.160
those layers NES games are gonna do it this like the background is one layer

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:58.920
and the sprites are a front layer and it's all in effect that's it but you

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:02.320

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:05.640
download it because it's free yeah it's free but I think I'm buying any of your

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:10.840
other fucking games other NES games and you know spinning unfortunately it

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.880
doesn't have internet play plus how are they gonna work that out did wasn't the

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:18.040
original excite bike kind of borked because there was a load save mode they

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:21.580
could fix that we get the original excite bike was a disc game and then

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:24.800
when they put it on the cartridge like it just flat-out didn't work when they

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:29.480
really fix that I thought when they even came the virtual console though maybe I

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:32.980

01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:35.320

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:50.120
tacos well it's the five dollar NES game plus a dollar premium which is

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.400
interesting that's not we points that's 599 it sounds like they're walking away

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:59.520
from we points that that's that's right because it was so hard to calculate we

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:05.400
points based on the one-to-one ratio that they had their 500 we points that's

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:12.840
five dollars also Game Boy ports Super Mario Land alleyway and radar mission

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:18.680
will all be out on day one DSI and DSI XL owners will be able to transfer most

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:22.440
of the DSI where purchases to the system there are some things that are not going

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:26.320
to be transferable I believe all of it has to do with like license things like

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.640
the Domo Coon games don't transfer over because they probably weren't licensed

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:33.080
for more than they came out over here I I didn't know they did either it might

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:37.640
only be a Japanese thing IDK well DSI where I obviously I'd never really

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.520
downloaded any DSI were so hold on though this is huge

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:46.440

on the Pokemon 3d models StreetPass functionality you unlock random Pokemon

01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:01.200
by exchanging data I don't know if that ties in the black why I don't think it

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.240
does it's something to do with the pokey decks and QR code support you take a

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.800
picture of your friend set it as a background layer snap a picture of a QR

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:18.120
code to introduce a Pokemon like what whatever I think it's also got the AR

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.480
cards or whatever support so you can do the 3d models whatever I got to admit it

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.440
sounds I just can't wait for all the fucking mudkips because you know it's

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.880

games on the 3ds so there you go all those announcements out now so they

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.080
don't have to talk about it at the press conference because they will be spending

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.880
all of their time undoubtedly talking about not just the new console but I'm

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.240
sure they will first parade out skyward sword for an update they'll parade out

01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:50.320
3ds titles including the Mario title and maybe some surprises there on the 3ds

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:58.120
and then easily half to two-thirds will be about whatever this cafe thing is

01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:03.520
slashes pop in our chat room says look under your seat it's a mudkip you get a

mudkip and you get a mudkip everyone's getting a mudkip yeah is there a be

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:14.800
Pokemon all right forget it well how about some other news for

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:22.680
Nintendo the the DS light actually will have actually today has a price

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:28.160
reduction it's gone down to $99 sucks for all you the bought one yesterday

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:36.780
yep but I guess they're just trying to clear out inventory who knows but the

01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:43.160
games are still the games there's not getting a price reduction pro tip I saw

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.040
them foursquare I know you stopped using foursquare but there is a pretty good

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.880
deal on it still check into Toys R Us and you get buy one get one half off on

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:58.760
DS and 3ds titles pro tip okay I'm which I don't think I got into it on this show

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:02.840
I was talking about it more on the Bobby call at the end of his show but I'm

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:06.040
convinced whatever this Nintendo controller is their little touch screen

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.640
thing I was saying on Bobby show you know Nintendo has been making touch

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.800
screens controllers for about five six years now it's called the DS and the

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.260
bottom half of that that's gonna be your controller it's a touchscreen with

01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:22.680
buttons you've had one all along it would be amazing if the DS would just

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:28.760
work as a controller but let's not let's there'll be a special new button or

01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:31.440
there'll be something extra on this thing Rob

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:40.800
all right moving on Loki freestyle games I may remember them from such series as

01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:49.320
DJ hero well thankfully they are not dead which is good apparently though I

01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:55.640
guess they have confirmed 35 positions will be lost but they still have a

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.820
strong partnership with Activision and they're currently working on a new

01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:04.880
innovative unannounced project and it says of course they plan to share

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.360
details about those project or the said project in the next coming months it's

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.960
good to see that they're still around hopefully we'll get Lisa DJ hero 3 out

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.960
of them yeah that would be cool I would appreciate that Rama's correcting me on

01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.680
something in the chat room nope you get your money back if there's a price drop

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:25.440
within two weeks of purchase you get the difference back well now that really

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.240
depends on what story you buy it at but okay fine I'll play your game here and

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:36.880
say sucks for those that bought it 15 days ago why are you buying a DS now I

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:42.240
mean seriously buy something else the 3ds will slowly add value before

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:45.520
Christmas before Christmas you're gonna see and there will be time like you're

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.160
gonna probably see the Netflix on 3ds in action and some of this at the

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.440
conference and all this so I think the 3ds is gonna see a lot more added value

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.700
before Christmas time it's just us early adopters we got Street Fighter pilot

01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:06.120
wings Ridge Racer IDK steel diver that's Zelda oh yeah Zelda yeah a game we

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:12.320
played 10 years ago it was overrated then alright love of God publisher stop

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:20.000
making your old games making an old game HD is not a fucking new game okay who

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.760
remembers a company called origin do you remember this company origin I believe

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:29.000
they didn't have the ultimate games back in the day yes the only origin I know of

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.680
is the ones that as the cosmetic company yeah well origin yeah they did the

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:38.960
ultimate games which is huge get this EA but origin system some time ago it was

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:41.720
like 20 years ago they bought it was a long time ago they're bringing back the

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:47.360
brand so to speak or at least the name with a direct to consumer gaming

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:54.080
platform here it is it's an EA store it's basically a competitor to steam EA

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:59.240
has launched the service and more than 150 games are already available on the

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:03.600
service it's also gonna have exclusive limited edition stuff like battle

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:10.000
field 3 Alice madness returns kingdoms of Amalur Star Wars the Old Republic is

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.760
supposedly going to be downloadable only on origin origin will have its own

01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:19.000
application which you can find connect with friends blah blah blah download

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.880
play PC games basically they're doing everything that seems doing trying to

01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:25.920
get a little more competition in space because let's face it the games for

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.560
Windows live thing really hasn't you know just broke through like I think

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.640
Microsoft is hoping it would apparently the service is also going to work on

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:39.800
mobile devices Scrabble mobile versions of battlefield 3 all of that will be on

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:46.400
the origin store as well speaking of Ultima randomly I did read an article

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.320
that Ultima 4 is now like free-to-play online so if you want to go back and

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.320
play like a classic RPG that will just it's as hard to it's it's just really a

01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:59.720
difficult title the NES version really dumped it up and it still was really

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:05.520
hard I would check out Ultima 4 that's what RPGs were when I was a kid and we

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:10.080
liked it more information I'm sure at EA's press

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:17.080
conference which is at 1230 Pacific 330 Eastern on Monday on right now is the

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.920
orange lounge radio mailbag every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:26.440
orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer will dive in pick a few of her favorites

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:31.160
and read them right now on the air well we got a bunch so I'm only gonna read

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.500
four and I picked them at random and I didn't pick any that were by the same

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:39.000
person okay so that was my criteria so if you're not getting read don't worry

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.120
I probably and you shouldn't get butthurt if you're not getting read I

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:46.720
mean I don't want to sound like we have ego here but we do have a nice

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:50.220
listenership we appreciate everybody that listens but when you all email us

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:53.340
at once we can't read it all or it would be a seven-hour show it's nothing

02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:57.780
personal yes I would like to say that if you've got something to send us just do

02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:02.800
it in one email I don't care if it's really long I would prefer the one email

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:08.200
so this one comes from Holly exactly how stupid is this guy who complained about

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:11.820
it and it's actually about the portal to being offended offending seriously

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:15.800
GLaDOS is the villain Wheatley is the villain they're supposed to make you

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:20.480
feel bad and insult you my husband is 200 pounds overweight and he found the

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.760
fat jokes absolutely hilarious why because they are villains how thick in

02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.600
the head do you have to be to think that the game is offensive because the villain

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:32.000
insults people more to the point she does it in the first game so you're

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.940
telling me that the moron bought the first game heard it ignored it and then

02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:40.500
decided to be offended the second game you know I I know why okay you know I

02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.480
know why there wasn't a rapture on Saturday God look down at the world and

02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:53.840
facepalmed I think to a god this was a ugly story last week but yeah I mean

02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:00.280
GLaDOS was very you couldn't take GLaDOS seriously you know what I mean

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.760
like the way the character was built and Wheatley was designed to be the dumbest

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:10.320
moron that ever lived end quote to me that whole thing was just sensationalist

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.360
media and it's just unfortunate like yeah people are gonna get offended but

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:19.880
you know what we all get offended they were completely the the news quote

02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:24.120
professionals did they ever respond to you by the way no of course not highly

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:30.600
unprofessional mm-hmm don't believe anything that they say more emails this

02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.320
one comes through the website just wanted to get your opinions on some

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.880
things what did you think of the original gold my double-oh-seven and

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.040
perfect dark I myself enjoy these games quite a bit because I'm a big fan of

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:47.280
first-person shooters keep up the good work sincerely CD Thunder well um they

02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:51.760
both made me throw up not because they were bad they were bad at all golden I

02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:56.800
was really great but I've told the story before when I first moved out here and

02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:01.240
lived with Dan he had a Nintendo 64 play golden I mm-hmm and I would end up

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:05.520
rolling over on the couch and staring at the back of the couch because I was so

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.920
nauseous that I could not watch him play so I would listen to him play golden I

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.720
was simply a landmark title like it just it did so much for first-person shooters

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.280
that's what that's why they tried to imitate it on the Wii and try to hit

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.800
gold twice but it kind of you know it just wasn't the same you know and that's

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.600
the unfortunate thing with a lot of these retro updates it's just not the

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.280
same well the first golden I came at what 15 years ago no not that long well

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:33.960
whenever the movie was out it was late night well yeah so I guess it's the

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:40.320
difference between you know trying to capture that same it's like movie remakes

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:49.120
now you just can't capture the same joy now perfect dark perfect dark the 361

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.640
that was a launch title I didn't care for it all but the original perfect dark

02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:59.600
was pretty awesome and it's fun to play on Xbox Live now just just saying well

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:05.120
we got another one through the website this is from Cal Roo I understand that

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.920
the news is trying to blame the game okay this is probably more about the

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:12.240
portal thing I understand that the news is trying to blame the game for poor

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:14.600
dialogue and dark soccer was blaming the news channel for their poor

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.280
investigation but neither of you guys really looked at the real issue and that

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:23.240
is the rating the this person is using such a horrible gram there's no

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:29.200
punctuation in here there's none but one ellipse okay anyway so the game was

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:33.560
rated e 10 plus and should have been rated T so a lot of the concepts in the

02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:36.720
game seemed to be a little over the head of the ten-year-old so let's stop

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:41.320
blaming games and blame the rating system well yeah the rating system is

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:48.400
shit anyway but I knew what adoption was when I was 10 I didn't you know it

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:53.360
doesn't matter I actually think the emailer has a wee bit of a point but at

02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.920
the same time it's no rating boards responsibility to fill the role of a

02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:03.920
parent and I don't know it's it's it's it's a really tough call like I get this

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:08.400
perspective a lot like even though you might have known what it was when you

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:12.880
were 10 I can see where maybe there wasn't enough warning that hey there

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:16.200
might be some jokes that are gonna go over a 10 years old 10 year olds head

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:19.800
and maybe this game really should be only played by teens and up like I gotta

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:24.720
be honest would I let my kid play portal I would yeah I don't think it's really

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:28.400
dangerous but that's but then again I don't have these sensitivities to watch

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:33.480
out for I got a baby to stop crying by playing portal to seriously dance cousin

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:37.080
was over here and her baby was crying in her lap so I asked if I could hold him

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:40.600
and then I held him while I was playing portal to in my lap and he thought it

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:44.040
was amazing let me put it this way as far as his email goes it's a fair

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:48.640
argument I'm just not sure I agree but I think this is a it's a valid counter

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:52.880
point I'll give you that I can see it I mean I honestly think that they should

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:55.800
just rate them the way they do movies mm-hmm then people would get it because

02:05:55.800 --> 02:06:00.880
apparently I honestly think that a lot of people especially ones who are not

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:07.480
gamers and that our parents now don't want to understand it they want other

02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:12.160
people to do their thinking for them and that's not acceptable so honestly if

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:14.320
you've got to answer a difficult question because you didn't do any

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:17.280
research into the game guess what that's on you

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:23.160
tricky-tricky is there more to the email or is that okay one more yeah one more

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:29.200
another one through the website I was picking the short ones okay a few shows

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:33.800
ago you picked you picked this this is towards me all a few shows ago you

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:36.840
picked up this old game called phantasmagoria I remember playing it when

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:40.480
I was 15 and absolutely loved it soon after that I played Gabriel Knight the

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.640
beast within after thinking back of those games I started to wonder if there

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:48.520
are any recent games out there that are point-click horrors all I've seen so far

02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:52.120
are mysteries and unfortunately it's more aimed at children I want my horror

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:56.120
and gore sad face toodles sill I love sill yeah

02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:01.680
stills still lived in amps they I don't know if she was in the capital of Holland

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:07.240
but she was in Dutch country and then she moved to Britain not that long ago

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:10.880
she's not in London but she's you know in another part of the country and yeah

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:13.520
we had her own a hoard house couple weeks ago she hosts the girls gone Wow

02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:19.520
podcast which is a lot of fun you should go on that show except at the time they

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:24.280
tape it's probably like 3 a.m. if they do it on a weekend and I don't have

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:30.080
school the next day but anyway back to the question itself phantasmagoria yeah

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.720
there really hasn't been a game like that a long time there was the Silent

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:36.240
Hill game only was kind of point-and-click II but not quite yeah I

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:38.760
mean there's there's one extreme of the other I know what she's talking which

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.680
talk about the Nancy Drew games are kind of like those mystery games that they're

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:45.680
kind of kitty they still have those coming on we oh yeah those well and they

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:50.880
still come out on PC as well those things still sell pretty well um as well

02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:54.720
for what they are I'm gonna do a quick bit of research on uh but yeah I mean if

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:58.080
you want to go to the console side I mean Silent Hill games still have you

02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:02.400
know the gore and the fun stuff and not just Silent Hill but Resident Evil what

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:05.760
are some of the other big horror franchise series we have and click games

02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:12.560
scary games we have monster basement 2 we have abandoned to dead-end hotel

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:19.200
haunted trap soul orchestrated death inculation x mortis 3 which looks pretty

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:23.960
gory the holes crime evidence to you know what actually game was kind of

02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:28.520
scary this is space this is actually a point-and-click games calm you know what

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:33.520
else actually remember the room thank you so salacious pop is jumping up and

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:36.160
down in chat I have to say this amnesia because I was thinking of that game too

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:40.600
I'm like what's that game that was on steam amnesia yeah amnesia is supposed

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:45.040
to be a scary as hell title on that's on PCs I would check out amnesia for sure

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:49.320
and that's a point-and-click well but do you remember the little flash game

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:53.640
that's called the room or crimson room or something like that Rob do you

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.440
remember that I'm sorry one more time sorry I was catching up on chat do you

02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:01.120
remember a game called like it was like crimson room or scarlet room where it

02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:04.800
was this one where you are in a room on a bed and it's just a little flash game

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:09.040
but you have to figure out how to get out of the room and different stuff

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.400
happens in the room you like you find a lighter and you have to like light some

02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:15.840
water and make steam to set off something and then you get a string

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:18.520
that falls out of somewhere and the whole point is trying to get out of the

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.320
room is that like don't shit your pants

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.760
no that's a whole other type of I'll see if I can find it link the chat room but

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:32.440
that one it wasn't really so much of a scary game per se but it was sort of

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:39.840
like kind of imagining yourself in that situation made it frightening that's

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.560
what I thought was interesting about it I love that game by the way don't shit

02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:50.840
your pants it's great game is that it for emails okay I think I actually found

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:56.760
it the scarlet room mailbag out orange lounge reader calm if you want to send

02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.000
us emails don't be butthurt if you don't get through though it happens there's

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.760
also the forms nobody freaking posts on the orange laundry forms and I think we

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.240
need to fix that we need to make that our mission this year to have some hop

02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:09.120
and forums so we need to encourage more discussion on the forums we're gonna

02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:14.600
work on that anyhow that's it for the mailbag yes all right we're gonna get

02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:20.780
into a game tonight and we're gonna do this with predictions and we're gonna do

02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:25.400
this in the style of an old board game called taboo remember the game taboo in

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:29.640
taboo there were certain phrases that you wanted to say but there were

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.840
certain things that you didn't want to say so the oil our hosts we're gonna go

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:38.320
around right now and give our predictions five things you will see at

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:45.080
e3 and five things you won't see at e3 so for everything that you will see at

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:49.320
e3 that is in indeed announced that host will earn a point now see we can't tally

02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:54.040
this up till later in the week but for everything that you won't see that they

02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:58.880
do say there's gonna be a buzz and that host will lose the point and the host

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.000
with the most points by whenever we have another show next Sunday after next will

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:10.480
win tacos yay so they'll have to buy themselves yes no I if it's not me I

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:16.880
will buy tacos if I win then Jamie has to make me tacos all right so here we go

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:22.160
five things we think will happen and five things that won't happen let's

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.720
start with the wills and we'll start with dark Sakura something you will see

02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:32.640
at e3 this year Microsoft will announce a halo game for connect Microsoft will

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.760
announce a halo game for connect we're going on kind of a kind of a safe bet I

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:39.800
think going off the rumors there right but and actually I blame Dan for my

02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:45.200
entire list so really he has to buy you tacos if I lose all right fair enough

02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:52.960
all right so Dan Dan wants the tacos if you win and we'll see what happens all

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:59.720
right Loki you got one for us new Super Mario Brothers sequel announced well

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:04.520
that's a real safe bet you guys are playing a super easy here you should get

02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:08.640
a half point for that one all right fine a new Super Mario Bros now I'm gonna I'm

02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.120
gonna go all in I'm gonna make a crazy-ass prediction here I'm gonna say

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:15.960
well this isn't that crazy but I think it will be announced at e3 Diablo 3 gets

02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:22.600
announced for console especially after having played the dungeon siege 3 demo

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.360
earlier this week I think it can be done and I think Activision is gonna really

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.520
push blizzard to put that out on the console just to test the waters we'll

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:38.520
see I could be full of garbage but this is just for fun right dark Sakura Sony

02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:43.880
will talk about network security Sony will talk about network security yes

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.520
they'll talk about how great their online is now know that they're gonna

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:52.600
toot their own horn some more and talk about how they're the safest it's gonna

02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:58.640
be Sony auto fellatio all right fair enough

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:05.560
Loki something you will see a new Grand Theft Auto sequel be announced once

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.800
again playing it very safe that's right a new Grand Theft Auto sequel announced

02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:14.960
fair enough I'm gonna go out on limb see I'm going crazy I'm gonna say that the

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:21.560
hardcore we title that is going to get you back to playing Nintendo III think

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:25.200
it's gonna be Star Fox I think it's new Star Fox game will be announced for the

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:31.400
cons the new whatever console it is I think if the whole touchscreen thing is

02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:36.280
true I could definitely see there being mapping and plotting and communications

02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:41.560
popping up from your little cohorts but most telling of all the fact that there

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:46.120
is a Star Fox game in the works being ported for 3ds blast from the past to

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:50.200
kind of raise awareness of the franchise again I think Star Fox is gonna be the

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:55.560
franchise that gets announced for Nintendo its new console dark soccer

02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:01.400
they're gonna verify the name of the new PSP the what of the new handheld

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:08.280
PlayStation they're gonna verify the name yes it's already leaked I said they were

02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:14.280
going to announce it uh-huh and before I realized that it had been put out mm-hmm

02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:19.040
so I said they're going to verify it all right and I'm gonna have to send you the

02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.640
list so you can yeah you'll have to send it to me so you can pile it and look

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:27.120
you'll have to do that to IDK and if you guys want to throw out your ideas in

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:34.400
chat room chat.org laundry.com things you think will happen at e3 Loki I think

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.440
that there will be a minor price drop on the Xbox 360 console and connect

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:44.160
hardware announced so like a bundle thing no I'm saying they're gonna drop

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.080
the price of the system and they're also gonna drop the price of the Kinect

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:52.560
interesting okay try to get more people on board yeah exactly because that's

02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:55.360
what they're pushing so you know makes sense that they would try to drop to the

02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:03.120
price of the console down all right the last drop was back in I don't you know

02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:08.880
when the last drop was actually um I'm gonna say that these because Soul

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.240
Calibur 5 we know it's gonna be there the Soul Calibur 5 bonus characters are

02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.440
Capcom inspired this time around they're not gonna be Star Wars absolutely not

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.600
Star Wars because we've already had that and I think this time they've already

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:23.680
done like some of the other big franchises so I think this time Soul

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:27.840
Calibur 5 will have Capcom and I'm saying this because of the whole kind of

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.280
we see them working together in Tekken cross Street Fighter and Street Fighter

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.840
cross Tekken the one that comes to mind right away Dante I think Dante will be a

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:42.980
character in Soul Calibur 5 that's my prediction okay two more Star

02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:50.520
Sakura um mine was more portal to download content more portal to download

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.360
content all right like oh like the valve will show off like the user creator

02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:03.440
stuff yeah there'd be that maybe new maps that they did and more more fun all

02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:08.200
right Loki this is kind of retarded but new

02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:12.280
Animal Crossing game announced oh so you think that's gonna be the Nintendo title

02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:18.040
that comes out the gate I'll be a 3ds hell for sure oh you think it'll be a

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:26.280
3ds thing yeah all right um let's see I'm gonna say that valve will show

02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:30.680
defense of the ancients 2 which I think is a risky pick for me because I think

02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:33.400
valve is pretty much said they're not showing anything already but I kind of

02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:36.760
think this game is ready to be shown more of because it's kind of their next

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.440
big thing they've got in the pipeline so I think defense of the ancients 2 is

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:44.760
gonna show up at e3 and one more prediction to round out the five Dark

02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:53.640
Sakura oh I broke from IRC darn it Dark Sakura um there was well Loki already

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:58.440
said it but it was on my list I'm gonna say it anyway an Xbox 360 price drop

02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:03.480
that's fine if somebody's list is duplicated that's fine in fact I will

02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.800
say one of the things that you said will show at e3 I have in my will not so this

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:13.840
is going to be good interesting all right um my oh sorry Loki your fifth and

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:19.240
final DS titles on the new Nintendo system will be on their virtual console

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:22.440
or download service where the hell they're gonna call it say it virtual

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:30.720
console so DS titles on new Nintendo system virtual console sorry black wolf

02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:35.640
posted in chat the picture from e3 and those that I saw those same creatures in

02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:40.440
what miklotov sent me those are the rage creatures yeah I saw there was a thing I

02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:43.800
could talk to where they're all boxed up or whatever they're having they're

02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:49.760
setting them up okay my last one on my list is I'm gonna go for kind of an easy

02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.320
one Nintendo will demo 3d Netflix I think this is a big thing that they're

02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:59.200
gonna be showing at e3 and they're gonna be showing 3d Netflix did we disconnect

02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:05.520

pitfalls of it okay we should be connected again so to recap I don't do

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:28.360
announced as the hardcore Wii title the Soulcalibur 5 bonus characters are

02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:32.480
Capcom inspired think Dante valve will show defense of the ancients 2 and

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:36.560
Nintendo will demo 3d Netflix ok so let's go to the five things you won't

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:41.400
see so if these things are said the host loses a point they get buzzed like in

02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:46.360
tab oops so let's see what the five things that were putting on the card

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:49.720
that they won't say stark soccer what's your first one no Final Fantasy 7

02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:55.240
remake I think that's a very safe bet everyone puts that on the I want to see

02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:59.760
it list every year and it's not gonna happen yep that's a good one

02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:07.360
alright so I have no Final Fantasy 7 Loki this would make me sad but no

02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:14.000
excite truck sequel probably not gonna happen I I actually put on my list Sony

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:19.680
will not acknowledge the PlayStation outlet outage directly there I'm gonna

02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:24.600
say that they will not say something about we apologize for the downtime

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:27.920
they're gonna try to look forward not backward that's not to say they won't

02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.880
say secure security and they will emphasize existing security but I don't

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:36.760
think you're gonna hear an apology for what happened you already got that

02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:42.240
supposedly so I don't think they're gonna announce the outage directly we'll

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:47.320
see though dark soccer your next one my next one is and this makes me sad

02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:56.120
Half-Life 2 episode 3 will not be announced nothing Loki I was gonna say

02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:59.440
the new Nintendo I don't even know see this is the problem I don't even know if

02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:03.840
they're gonna announce the price but the new Nintendo system will not be under

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:10.320
$250 now that's a that's a good guess what do you think it will cost $2.99 I

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:12.720
think it's gonna be $2.99 the controllers are gonna be a lot more

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:17.120
expensive that's it price is gonna be difficult but they're gonna have to

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:22.280
justify it somehow I think the controllers will be $79 $79 99 79 99 and

02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:28.200
they're gonna be half a DS my list my number two thing on things you won't see

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:33.760
killer instinct sorry file that in the fanboy went category too and there's

02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:38.440
been rumblings this year that it's supposed to come back now no enjoy your

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:41.400
Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter remakes and all this because that's as good as

02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:48.840
it's gonna get dark soccer no new Microsoft or Sega system well you know

02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:53.200
people there is rumors every year about a Microsoft portable so dark soccer

02:21:53.200 --> 02:22:04.920
saying nope not happening Loki I would have to say probably that there there's

02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:11.520
not going to be like I don't even know what you'd call it like the one versus 100 type

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:15.640
thing anymore they're not gonna announce you know some sort of community gaming

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:21.560
type thing no more community games yeah okay fair enough I'm gonna say that one

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:26.560
thing you won't see a Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you will

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:30.480
see big pushes on 13 to instead they're gonna just it's not that they're gonna

02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:34.480
try to erase that 14 ever happened but they're gonna push 13 to before they try

02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:41.240
to revisit 14 I think dark soccer Sega will make a good Sonic game that's

02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:48.880
something you won't see that's a good one that's gonna be hard to see we'll

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:54.240
have to see what the feedback is in the show floor I suppose all right Loki you

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:58.000
will not see a new dance masters game

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:04.040
probably not I would you go so far as to say you will not see a

02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:11.840
non-ddr konami dance game a non-ddr konami dance game yes I would go that

02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:17.200
far okay funny enough my number four is about a music game as well I don't think

02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:22.040
you're gonna see a DJ game from harmonix and when I say DJ game from harmonix I

02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:26.600
mean one that involves a turntable controller because it could be that the

02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:29.680
new are obviously whatever harmonix makes is gonna be music based but I

02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:33.880
don't want that interpretation to be too loose I'm talking turntable and keys not

02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:37.840
happening I think harmonix is gonna go somewhere new with something you haven't

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:43.560
thought of and let's see dark soccer let's wrap up the lesson number five

02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:50.960
Duke Nukem booth dudes as in like you know scantily clad men what if there is

02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:55.280
a Duke Nukem with that that doesn't count all right I said like you know

02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:58.240
like scantily clad dudes okay fair enough

02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:04.800
logi this is gonna be kind of a risky one but and not including because I know

02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:08.320
that these are coming out because you know I look at this kind of stuff not

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:17.640
including these like greatest hits re-releases or third-party games you

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:24.960
will not see any new first-party PSP games no new first-party PSP games that's

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:29.440
a and I'm talking about actual UMD discs I'm not talking about some stupid like

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:37.040
download content I'm talking first-party UMD PSP games black wolf in our chat is

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.800
calling shenanigans on the fact that you have a Konami thing on your list when

02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:42.920
they already did a press conference however I'm actually gonna back you up

02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:47.280
because that doesn't mean it was everything because we don't know what

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:50.720
Nintendo's got and anything that Konami is making for the new Nintendo system is

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:56.440
under wraps and I I would stand by the fact that just because they didn't say

02:24:56.440 --> 02:25:00.080
it in their little pre thing doesn't mean it doesn't exist like glee karaoke

02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:03.160
revolution wasn't in their thing guarantee you there's another one of

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:09.400
those coming so I'm gonna allow it even though it's probably a safe bet it will

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:14.320
still count for tacos all right and my last answer this is a duplicate and it's

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.800
it's a painful one but I also put you will not see half-life anything sorry

02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:24.680
Alan I actually wrote it just like that half-life anything sorry Alan yeah I

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:31.680
thought of Alan when I put that but I will keep him when I was at work I would

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:38.560
plug in my my little iPhone and listen to all the dialogue through half-life 2

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:43.860
well the episodes mm-hmm and that's how I got through half nice because I

02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:47.840
couldn't you know didn't play much at home so I got to hear the entire game so

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:53.000
I was like what more what happens all right let's recap the five buzz things

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.040
the things that will cause a host to lose a point if it happens dark Sakura

02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:03.440
my list dun dun dun is no Final Fantasy 7 remake half-life 2 episode 3 will not

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.880
be announced no new Microsoft or Sega systems Sega will make a good Sonic game

02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:14.920
and Duke Nukem booth dudes Loki the excite truck sequels not happening the

02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:23.200
Nintendo system will not be under $250 no community games on you know no off

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:28.400
like one versus 100 stuff no dance masters game or non DDR dancing game

02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:37.840
from Konami and no first-party PSP UMD games all right and on my list of five

02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:41.040
things you won't see Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outage

02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:46.000
directly killer instinct Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you'll

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.920
see big pushes on 13-2 instead you will not see a DJ game from harmonix meaning

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:55.080
one with a turntable and buttons and you will not see half-life anything sorry

02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:00.400
Alan alright so we'll see what develops next week I've got to bring in the

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:06.360
actual buzzer when we do the recaps oh we've got one sounds of failure has the

02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.480
family feud buzzer oh yeah there's the sound effects thing the tire clogged

02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.680
maybe like a year ago with all the you know you said I use that on it for Dan

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:22.040
shadow every time he makes a joke we play sad trombone oh yeah there it is

02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:30.440
it's bookmarked right here sound effects of failure so here you go sorry so when

02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:37.040
they say hey it's a sonic game that doesn't suck Oh dark Sakura I like that

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:41.880
when you click it then it does the X that's funny I like the toilet flush too

02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:47.640
all right anyhow let's move on we gotta get the F use the week done because if

02:27:47.640 --> 02:28:07.440
we don't get our angst out then I don't know what happens with something bad I

02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:13.600
accidentally kicked Loki oops I tried to voice him and kicked him instead fuck

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:18.880

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:24.320
and it stinks really bad too so thank you Sally Hansen company for taking five

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:31.540
dollars of my money fuckers and also fuck you to feeling like crap in my

02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:36.760
intestines all day eating all those delicious cupcakes last night damn it

02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:39.720
Rob why'd you have to bring this delicious orange cupcakes they were

02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:43.520
orange creamsicle I knew you would love that because they tasted like the blood

02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:51.620
orange pinkberry by the way I'm riding a high this week because pinkberry tweeted

02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:54.640
me this week and they could they did tell me the blood they told me

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:59.840
personally on Twitter the blood orange will be back this makes me happy but

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.800
salted caramel is fucking good oh my god chocolate no I just had it with a little

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:08.160

02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:12.040
brought to you by amazing I'm sitting here with two pinkberry gift cards on

02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:16.920

02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:22.960
to a lack of pinkberry my F you the week goes to the thing freezing up and

02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:25.600
dumping the listeners for like 10 minutes and I didn't even realize it

02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:29.760
because we weren't connected in chat still and my F you the week goes to me

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:33.560
for not trying harder to do III this year I think I think in retrospect I

02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:37.680
probably should have done it I'm really looking forward to this whole coverage

02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:41.560
and kind of trying something different but I don't know it's it's gonna be sad

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:45.680
kind of missing all the atmosphere of e3 but at the same time my wallet says

02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:52.120
thank you but I know there's Disneyland that's gonna rock it's a small world

02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:56.360
okay you're not gonna subject Bobby that's a small world yes I am no I am

02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:00.160
gonna take Bobby on it's a small world if you won't go in California screaming

02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:03.760
he has to go and it's a small world that's the compromise three times in a

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:09.160
row I'm not that mean but Bobby you get to pick you you're either gonna go on

02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:14.120
California screaming or it's a small world and when you ride it's a small

02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:18.440
world dark soccer and I will be singing I will warn you it's a small world last

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:23.520
longer than California scream in 15 minutes and me who gets bad vertigo and

02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:27.760
hates roller coasters can do California screaming just fine and then or Tower of

02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:32.760
Terror I cannot now I can't do Tower of Terror I tried to take Bobby on Tower of

02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:37.480
Terror Daniel go on Tower of Terror I love to I love Tower dance in the other

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:42.000
I'm saying I'm gonna tell her Janice Dan I scream like a girl on Tower of Terror

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.640
now when I came off of Tower of Terror I was so dizzy that I could not walk

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:52.000
straight okay all right back to F use the week sorry Loki F you to Disneyland

02:30:52.000 --> 02:31:03.320
talk I guess happy not being able to go to E3 really like to have gone to E3 not

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:06.080
necessarily to be able to see all the wonderful boots and stuff because I'd

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:11.560
be in my own hotel room being able to sleep all night long oh how I wish I

02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:18.960
could sleep all night long my baby doesn't understand that he needs to

02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:24.360
sleep at least when your baby is 13 he can mow the lawn oh this is what I have

02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:29.600
to say parents have no right to complain because they picked this I didn't pick

02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:32.760
for the child not to sleep through the night you picked to have one yeah I

02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:37.240
understand that goes with it is it your fault if you buy a car and explodes on

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:44.000
you but it's a given that babies wake up at 3 in the morning hungry or poopy or

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:49.400
have to pee or that they want mommy all the time it's not really actually all of

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:53.040
our friends don't have a problem with that it's just baby nature it's just that

02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:56.800
our child decides hey you know what I need to be swaddled still at 10 my I

02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:01.800
wake up that morning some past me whatever you know he just we moved him

02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:07.600
into his own room so that's also an additional bit of fun I'm just used to

02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:13.960
it now I wake up at 4 in the morning every day so all right let's move on to

02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:18.200

video on Skype or 1 8 7 7 game olr after two more stories Loki yes so this is

02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:40.160
kind of cool you know there's been a lot of rumors that there's going to be

02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:45.440
gaming coming to the Apple TV device but everyone seems to forget hey you know

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:49.080
what there's other things out there that you can stream movies on to and now

02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:56.200
Rovio is actually negotiating with developers to create games specifically

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:03.040
for their Roku box and it will I guess be TV based games you know casual stuff

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:08.560
and they've really said how the controller gonna work I guess it may be

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:15.120
the you know new boxes or whatever can come with a controller but it's kind of

02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:18.240
neat though to see the gaming is coming to everything I mean I sure won't be

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:22.560
long before we're just you know having internet able the TVs that you're

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:28.240
playing games off of without any sort of additional software yeah on live

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:34.680
without any additional software well I well the boxes that I understand that

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:41.680
I'm talking about in internet enabled TV alright alright whatever alright so

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:47.640
would you be interested in a Roku box now I had a feeling there's no reason

02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:55.640
alright let's move on you poor guys are bullying Bobby into writing no no I'm

02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:57.840
just being honest because keep in mind the first time I read California

02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:03.480
Screamin I wrote it in the middle and got sick as fuck at least we'll go on

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.440
Toy Story Midway Mania and that right is amazing it is but no when I when I

02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:11.120
started writing California Screamin in the front car never got sick again

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:16.080
it's the same like being in the front seat of the car I get motion sick in the

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:20.000
backseat in the front seat of mine alright one more story for you guys

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.880
before we get to the Skype line this story is about Animal Crossing but it

02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:27.040
might not be what you're expecting it's a story that Kotaku ran earlier this

02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:31.840
week and I guess it was kind of from another site called anti pixelante.com

02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:38.520
here's the deal it's a story about I don't even know where to go here with

02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:43.440
Animal Crossing the tie the story is titled if you could bone one Animal

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.920
Crossing character who would it be and the site anti pixelante.com has actually

02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:54.160
combed the depths of I guess what is this site called like rule 34 which I

02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:58.960
guess rule 34 is an internet rule about if it exists there's porn full of it so

02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:04.240
these people anti pixelante.com actually combed the website to find what Animal

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:09.400
Crossing characters were most popular on rule 34 and believe it or not there were

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:17.480
59 pornographic images of the stitch lady that helps you to the crop make

02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:22.760
your own patterns Hazel yeah Hazel so Hazel was the most popular character

02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:27.400
with 59 pornographic images next up and I'm surprised he wasn't number one Tom

02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:33.760
Nook was second place with 30 and then the other well it's Abel and Mabel or

02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:37.360
something like that isn't it the Abel sisters the Abel sisters the other Abel

02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:42.080
sister had Mabel and Mabel and then KK whatever he is

02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.120
okay KK was 13 and then I don't even know who that last chick is that's the

02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:51.960

02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:36.080
know of course the connect Star Wars game is being shown by the way these

02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:39.920
connects Star Wars game based on the video footage that we've seen so far

02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:46.200
looks very terrible lag-tastic fun also apparently there is going to be a

02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:51.680
Disneyland adventures game for connect where you run around Disneyland and ride

02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:55.720
rides and stuff like that sounds like a game that you two would be picking up

02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:05.800
yeah well some this is kind of awful there is a a modder for a Super Smash

02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:12.600
Brothers brawl that made a mod for that replacing solid snake with Conan O'Brien

02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:18.320
and he in fact even does his string dance at the end of the round it's

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:25.080
awesome so I don't think I don't know if there's a place you can download that

02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:39.440
forms dot kc dash m i m dot com slash gallery slash brawl or slash brawl view dot php question mark number one thousand sure people are writing this down

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:43.560
furiously well thank you know what they download the podcast and they can go

02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:49.520
back and rewind it and stuff like that and get everything number equals 19,000

02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:56.560
277 alright or just go search on Kotaku you can find it interesting also the

02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:01.280
Melger's and zone of vendors collection those collections will actually be

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:04.680
downloadable as well so if you don't want to purchase the box sets and maybe

02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:09.520
you only want one title in HD you can download those I believe separately so

02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:16.520
that's gonna be kind of neat I found you subtitled animal crossing on YouTube and

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:23.760

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:32.120
trailer is that the whole movie movie very cool let's see also I was gonna

02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:38.080
talk about here apparently mad cats you know following the footsteps of red

02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:43.360
octane are actually becoming game publishers themselves they have launched

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:50.080

02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:57.640

how are you I'm doing good are you excited for e3 I don't know if I'm

02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:30.240
excited more for e3 or not going on California screaming yeah I'm trying to

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.320
get them to stop picking on you but you know you should be glad my friend

02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:38.200
Victoria isn't going because she says I have a rule you go on every ride once

02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:42.680
and if you don't like you never have to go on it again but I'm a little more

02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:45.320
forgiving if somebody says no Rob I'm really not going on I'm like okay

02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.440
whatever I did that I'm not gonna bully I went on I went on a Tower of Terror

02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.240
and it sucks but if Bobby's like I don't want Bobby to barf so if he's gonna barf

02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:57.060
he's not going on it anyway yes yeah I wouldn't barf what it is is I do have a

02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:02.840
medical condition and I will pass out and I don't want to pass out if Disney

02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:05.480
doesn't want me to pass out because then they escort you out of the park yes you

02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:09.200
will have to you will have to hydrate him and watch over him if he passes out

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:12.560
because you forced me to go on that right all right Dan's like then we get

02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:17.560
to go backstage all right look we're playing the little game tonight about

02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:21.400
things you will see and things you won't see at e3 and you're calling shenanigans

02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:25.880
on Loki's list I know but so Bobby I'm gonna put you on the spot I won't make

02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:29.280
you name five but tell me something you think we will see maybe that we missed

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:35.440
something we will see is something we won't see well I mean the won't see is

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:38.440
actually I had a call on my show tonight that asked me you know what what would

02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:44.440
you not see there and I said a new Space Quest or really any new Sierra adventure

02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:48.880
titles I think that's a pretty fair guess yeah because I mean I can't see

02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:52.920
Activision re resurrecting King's Quest or anything like that well have we had

02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:57.820
the telltale King's Quest games were announced didn't that come out a few

02:43:57.820 --> 02:44:06.440
months ago yeah but we won't see it at e3 I'm gonna get my buzzer ready I'm not

02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:12.480
playing all right fine we'll see we'll see all right what about something that

02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:19.540
will happen something that will I'm you know it's kind of hard because like I've

02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:25.720
seen a lot of the stuff that you know kind of is going in and stuff what we

02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:34.960
will see I I think we will I think we will get a price on the Nintendo I think

02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:38.860
they will say the price interest even though it's end of 2012 I think they're

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:41.520
gonna go ahead and announce a price or at least something they're aiming for

02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:46.760
yes hmm okay that's a pretty fair really it's end of 2012 I thought it would be

02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:51.880
the same launch frame as 3ds Wow I didn't realize that boy that's a long

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:56.520
tease now what I want to see is I want to see them do pac-man versus is one of

02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:00.680
the demo games they could they could re-release all that stuff that they did

02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.800
for the Game Boy Advance connect cable that nobody ever played can they will

02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:09.400
because that's Nintendo oh well that's easy let's do it that way the only one

02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:11.880
that probably wouldn't happen is Crystal Chronicles because that wasn't first

02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.400
party that was a weird game I liked it but it was weird it wasn't really

02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:21.320
fantasy it was just kind of in that storyline I guess all right well any

02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:24.800
other thoughts for us Bobby before we talk to you again on Tuesday live from

02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:30.600
Los Angeles okay so I'm supposed to look for large chibis mm-hmm and I'm supposed

02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:35.660
to look for Duke Nukem booth dudes yes okay okay so weak so I could can I

02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:39.560
provide the buzzer if I find the booth dudes yes you can because I have found

02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:45.360
they hate they usually do have somewhere the scantily clad muscular guys right

02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:50.560
now the question is are they going to be advertising Duke Nukem we'll find out so

02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:53.800
get that buzzer ready and yes you I give you full permission to buzz dark soccer

02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:58.360
if that happens although really like I'm gonna buzz me I'm sure all right yes

02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:03.700
did you go by telltale smooth all right no it's fine I don't I don't think they

02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:08.040
have a booth II they I don't think they do it either they do that was they do it

02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:13.280
packs yeah they do packs but they don't get a booth at e3 and I mean and if

02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:15.720
there is a king quest thing they'd be should probably shown in Activision's

02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.600
group booth because they own the IP oh that's right it's like a joint thingy so

02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:24.560
okay well Bobby I will talk to you more on Tuesday have a safe flight tomorrow

02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:28.840

02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:00.800
minute so she pretty good Ubisoft not what I'm sorry I see this type of thing

02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:03.960
I'd usually expect from Ubisoft but here's one of Activision's big

02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:07.920
announcements that they're gonna be making Activision Publishing and Sega

02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:14.920
toys they have created wappy dog wappy dog is basically an eyebo ripoff for the

02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:21.840
Nintendo DS and it will allow you to interact with the robot dog in the game

02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:32.040
and you will to does wappy dog come with Jack a cat I don't think that's what it

following the events of the 1953 film and include a new story arc characters

02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:04.360
locations and subplots you know I'd actually be kind of cool to see like

could probably pull it off on one of them but going on going on what I was

02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:44.860
trying to bring up tonight was the whole Call of Duty elite thing which is

02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:50.840
basically activisions next you know shameless attempted and money-grabbing

02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:57.280
mmm I'm sensing you're not a fan no I mean I don't understand when other other

02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:02.800
like when other developers other companies you know like like Bungie and

02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:08.520
EA have offered these services for free and activisions mostly paywalling the

02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:14.560
the good stuff like videos I mean it's what I'm sensing is that they are

02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:19.400
probably going to herald the the next video game crash you think about it and

02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:23.600
I bring this up because you think about how the first one happened and how this

02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:28.600
one might might draw parallels to the one half the one in 83 where you have

02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:33.080
like one we have one particular company just trying to hash out you know

02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:37.960
multiple just trying to just trying to rehash franchises to the point where

02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:44.800
quality degrades and you know fans get turned off you know I I don't think

02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:48.320
another video game crash across the board is possible I think there is

02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:51.800
possible company failures I don't think forever you're going to have Nintendo

02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:55.360
Sony Microsoft one of them will fail where you're getting to the point where

02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:59.880
activisions literally watering down diluting the entire first-person shooter

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:06.920
genre like if people for the most you know if for the most part consumers I'm

02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:10.640
not talking about the hardcore gamers the ones that consistently by Call of

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:15.440
Duty you know the ones that basically don't have other first-person shooters

02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:22.120
lined up aside from aside from like the second Call of Duty Halo gears you know

02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.600
like the small really I'm trying to like put my finger on the demographic but

02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:31.880
it's the type of person that wouldn't care less about what the scene things in

02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:36.840
more important you know it's just like instantly gratified by by just

02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:39.960
explosions so what about what about just like voting with your dollars you know

02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:44.000
it's a concept we were talking about a lot I understand that it's possible but

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.360
when you have when you have one company just giving negative connotations to one

02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:53.480
genre but just like trying to nickel and dime people every step of the way and

02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:58.240
just trying to like not really innovate then it's gonna be harder for other

02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:03.840
titles to really stand out unless battlefield 3 manages to pull an upset

02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:07.920
which I know it will because it has a lot to offer on the table and I think

02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:11.120
that yeah I don't think it's gonna lead to a crash I think it would just be yeah

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:14.800
battlefield 3 might become the new champion you know or maybe I get to the

02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:18.840
point where video gamers are gonna get sick and tired of actually of having to

02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:22.240
deal with just mediocrity okay well let me throw this question at you kind of

02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:25.240
out of left field here because you mentioned Halo is one of the games that

02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:29.600
you think has done it very well but we know that activism bungee every party

02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:34.640
for every bunch he was the first was first really to pioneer such a thing

02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:39.160
where they integrated you know the ability to look up your stats online and

02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:43.880
post the video straight from the console but I know it has the bungee and

02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:46.520
Activision are partnering up for whatever this next game at least

02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:50.920
Activision is publishing it so do you think that the same you know nickel and

02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:55.360
dime extra stuff I don't really need the thing is gonna continue and now it's

02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:59.680
under Activision I mean Microsoft didn't do that much didn't even do any of that

02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:04.040
like I know when you know when bungee was working with Microsoft that never

02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:08.600
happened because they were trying new ways to engage people into the into that

02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:14.160
genre and into that game and what better way and then to launch all you know the

02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:19.040
the whole halo waypoint thing I believe where it allows you to interact you know

02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:24.520
look up your scores post it on Facebook and so forth but then you know when

02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:28.200
Activision is thrown into the mix you have a company that's helping on just

02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:33.320
trying to like monetize and maximize every single every single dollar out of

02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:37.760
all their their IP to the point where just like they're willing to cut

02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:42.560
corners and sacrifice quality in the name of the almighty dollar let me ask

02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:45.280
this question we gotta wrap up and get more calls let me ask this question in

02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:50.240
on this what do you think they could do to make more money on the franchise that

02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:55.640
doesn't seem so nickel-and-dime well first of all you shouldn't try to like

02:52:55.640 --> 02:53:00.600
you shouldn't try to nickel and dime for things that are have been offered for

02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:05.680
free in the past like that whole call of duty elite that it looks many people

02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:10.560
just like shrugged it off so far because from what I heard for example on the

02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:15.360
other sites like a taco for example they basically you know they basically shut

02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:19.400
they basically wrote it off as just another money grab so they basically

02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:24.640
they have they really have no hopes for this um for this endeavor they really

02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:29.080
don't they just like it doesn't faze them it doesn't engage them that well

02:53:29.080 --> 02:53:34.120
and that's getting a really lukewarm reception right and you know more

02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:38.680
importantly trying to create innovative ways to re-engage your customers like

02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:44.040
try not to be hacked the same you know the same boring old five-hour campaign

02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:50.080
and instead offering new ways to offer balanced gameplay like if they fix up

02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:54.400
the game playing in multiplayer where it's not a camp fest then they could

02:53:54.400 --> 02:53:58.680
then they have a better shot we at least have one person agreeing with you in the

02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:02.520
chat room dark toa gak says Activision is one shit of a company for something

02:54:02.520 --> 02:54:06.880

something that actually will make Loki say wow that looks cool like if that

02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:04.240

was an awesome five-star review left this week about somebody saying that he

03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:37.480
listened to the show when he was like younger and he feels like he's kind of

03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:41.000
growing up with the show and I'm like oh we're buzzies so yeah leave us a nice

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:44.200
review on iTunes you don't have to be warm fuzzy so if you don't know or tell

03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:46.920
a friend that's what we really want to tell word of mouth is all we got we do

03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:51.200
not have a giant booth at e3 to spread the word of olr we will be lucky if we're

03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:54.840
were they able to get within 50 feet of the building and you know we don't have

03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:57.440

get up early to watch Microsoft's conference tomorrow good times Loki just

03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:19.200
looking forward to tomorrow and watching the conferences I've really disappointed

03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:23.520
that when Nintendo isn't tomorrow but whatever good things come to those who

03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:30.000
wait which by the way I think our win amp might have crashed again here that's

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:34.000
just lovely is people in chats complaining about the stream because my

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:40.400
win app has locked up yet again I'm just not having good luck today yep
