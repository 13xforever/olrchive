00:00.000 --> 00:19.020
Tonight, June 26, 2011, could the 360 see free to play games?

00:19.020 --> 00:24.180
Xbox brings Kinect functionality to advertisements, and can Silent Hill be scary without Pyramid

00:24.180 --> 00:31.680
Head?

00:31.680 --> 00:35.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet once again, and welcome back to another week

00:35.280 --> 00:39.480
of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.520
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome

00:42.520 --> 00:48.440
co-hosts as I have joined with them for the past nine freaking years.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.120
Say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura, Jamie Sowers.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.520
Who let you in my house?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.280
That's right, I did.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.240
How are you?

00:56.240 --> 00:58.080
I'm recovering.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.080
Recovering from?

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
Sinus infection.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
Oh, I was going to say.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.560
Remember I had a sinus infection last week.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.440
I was going to say it's Pride weekend, so maybe you were recovering from-

01:06.440 --> 01:08.440
I'm recovering from the gay.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
All right.

01:09.440 --> 01:14.040
Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki, who is setting up something

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
tech right now.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
What are you doing over there?

01:16.040 --> 01:17.680
You're like getting your, his Xbox.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
He's hooking up the Bloom Box.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.840
His Orlando Bloom autographed Xbox.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.840
Why?

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
Because he could.

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
Yes.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
For no good reason.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
What are you going to play on there?

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
Are you playing Child of Eden again?

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
I don't know.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
I haven't decided yet.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
He's just hooking up.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
He just wants to play.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
Galgun.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
He just wants to play games.

01:33.840 --> 01:34.840
Galgun.

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
I don't want to play Galgun.

01:35.840 --> 01:36.840
We have special guests joining us tonight.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
Of course, as always, you guys in chat.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
Chat.orangelandre.com.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.560
You join us live and we read your comments here.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.980
It is a show where every gamer has a voice.

01:43.980 --> 01:47.640
We will have the phone lines open later despite that little tease I gave on Bobby's show

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
beforehand.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
We will have the phone lines open later.

01:49.640 --> 01:53.880
And of course, Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Email bag, mailbag, orangelandre.com.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.880
They get it all?

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
Someone didn't put it on the show roll.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Whatever.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
It's not there?

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
No.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.880
Oh, well, we are doing the mailbag at some point.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.520
When is a mystery to everybody?

02:03.520 --> 02:07.040
Anyhow, let's introduce the guests we have here in studio.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.460
We have some blast from the past here to celebrate nine years of O-L-R with us.

02:11.460 --> 02:16.240
As mentioned on Bobby's show, when you have your 100th episode, your 200th episode, your

02:16.240 --> 02:23.440
five-year episode, you kind of run out of, like, the ego stroking gets a little old.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.520
But we thought, what better way to mark nine years of O-L-R than to invite somebody who's

02:27.520 --> 02:29.200
on a show that's even older.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.520
So say hello to the one and only Jessica Harper is here tonight.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.280
I thought you were going to say, you know, when you're talking about ego stroking, who

02:35.280 --> 02:37.280
better than Jessica Harper?

02:37.280 --> 02:40.640
Is that another word for it?

02:40.640 --> 02:42.800
How are you, Jessica?

02:42.800 --> 02:43.920
I'm doing just fine.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
Welcome.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.400
This is, you know, some of the dinner people from back in the day of Maundy Days know you

02:48.400 --> 02:53.920
as Iguana Girl, the queen bee of DDR Freak for quite some time.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
Exactly, yeah.

02:54.920 --> 02:55.920
The queen bitch.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.320
But we got all the DDR Freak gossip, you know, a few months ago when you were on the show

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
last.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.160
So I don't know how much of that we want to revisit.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.600
We'll see how much wine we get in yet.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.840
Yeah, I know.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.000
That's pretty much, but I have to make sure I don't have too much.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.400
But of course, you're here tonight to help plug the Under Sedation Live 10-year anniversary

03:12.400 --> 03:13.400
show is coming up.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.000
It's coming up on July 16th.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.120
We will have 10 years and we'll be sealing Rob away for that night.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.960
So he'll have to have the fun of doing two shows in one week.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.860
Because as you guys may or may not know, I was doing Under Sedation Live back when it

03:27.860 --> 03:29.480
first started back then.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.920
It was before OLR.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.480
OLR was a spinoff of Under Sedation Live in some ways, you know, in some ways, just like

03:35.480 --> 03:39.560
DDR Freak Radio, which again, another blast from the house right there, was a spinoff

03:39.560 --> 03:41.460
of Under Sedation Live.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.600
So we all kind of formed our own stations based off of that station.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.560
Yes, we all hatched out of that egg and somehow we all came out looking like Lady Gaga, our

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
respective shows.

03:50.560 --> 03:55.180
I came out looking more like Rudall, but I don't know.

03:55.180 --> 03:59.560
Complete with the CGI face on the very odd, all right, anyhow.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.720
As long as you make sure I'm wearing an octopus and have, you know, a big, huge building on

04:02.720 --> 04:03.720
my head, I'm all good.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.880
Wait, are you going for the Ursula look with the octopus?

04:06.880 --> 04:10.200
Exactly, in the building, you know, I have to have the large building.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.560
Which by the way, can I just random tangent?

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
I was at Disneyland.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.360
I had to go without Alan because, you know, it was just finances being what they were.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.200
But there's two things that Alan loves.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.480
He loves Hello Kitty and he loves Ursula.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.480
And you know what I was able to find at Build-A-Bear?

04:23.480 --> 04:24.480
Hello Kitty Ursula?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.440
A Hello Kitty and I put an Ursula costume on it.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.800
There you go.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.880
And it's the best thing ever.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.400
Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
That was awesome.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
All right.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
We will talk video games, I promise.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.400
Oh, and her name is Divine.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
Yeah, her name is Divine.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Anyhow.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
It's more appropriate.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
We'll talk video games in a moment.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.440
But I have to introduce another blast from the past.

04:42.440 --> 04:49.240
And this is somebody who wasn't on Under Sedation Live, but he was on many, many, many early

04:49.240 --> 04:51.120
episodes of Orange Law and Tradeo.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.120
And then he disappeared.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.960
But now he's back.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.560
Say hello everybody to the one and only Intern Drew is back tonight.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.560
Hey, what's up?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.320
You can't keep me away from this place for long.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.440
And still having a little bit of wine right now.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.560
And it's going to affect me far more than it will Jessica.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.560
This is creeping me out because back when the 23rd Magus was on the show back in the

05:11.560 --> 05:12.960
day, you weren't old enough to drink.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
I was 17.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
Oh my God.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.960
I'm so old.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.580
And now I feel old.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.360
But I've been here for nine years.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.960
He was also shut up with all of that right about now.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.480
He was also our resident young Republican.

05:24.480 --> 05:29.160
From the two females in the room, can we both say shut up?

05:29.160 --> 05:31.960
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

05:31.960 --> 05:37.880
And now I'm this is reminding me of my first show because once again, it's actually it's

05:37.880 --> 05:40.320
it's Loki that has the pizza this time.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.480
And I'm the closest to the floor.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.200
So yeah, feeling old and moldy right now.

05:46.200 --> 05:52.000
This reminds me of the first show too because I had a migraine that day.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.120
Just wait for it to be hot in here.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.640
I know it's gonna get hot with all these and the AC is on.

05:57.640 --> 06:00.840
We can turn up the fans on the window open now and we'll figure it out.

06:00.840 --> 06:01.840
All right.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.600
So guys, once again, if you want to join us in our chat room chat about orange lounge

06:04.600 --> 06:06.880
radio dot com, you can join us.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.200
And yeah, join in the party and comment on the shows.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.040
Break Man starts us off saying he left and comes back and is still an intern.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.040
Lol.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.040
Absolutely.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.800
Because as long as he's an intern, we don't have to pay him as she 100.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.840
Matt says, Oh, God, hide your soundboard tables.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.960
That is one of the highlights, I guess you could say, of our history was the night the

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
23rd Magus.

06:28.960 --> 06:33.280
I'm going to call him that all night long because it's retro, broke the soundboard.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.840
Well, he didn't really break the soundboard, but he, what'd you do?

06:35.840 --> 06:39.520
You leaned up against the card table that soundboard was on and the whole damn thing

06:39.520 --> 06:42.560
just collapsed and we wouldn't get legs knocked off.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.260
Yeah, we went dead for a good 30 seconds and all the chatters are like, Oh, the stream

06:46.260 --> 06:47.260
went down.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.260
I don't get it.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.260
I'm still connected.

06:49.260 --> 06:50.260
You broke the show.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.260
Yeah.

06:51.260 --> 06:52.260
And then it turned out drew broke the show.

06:52.260 --> 06:56.120
They could see that was back when we had the webcam, Justin TV cam and I would hide on

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
the couch.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
That's right.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.320
And we had to be on cam and it was, it was better set up there.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.320
So we had the Justin TV cam back then and the, everybody could see what was happening

07:03.320 --> 07:06.140
on the Justin TV cam, but they couldn't hear it.

07:06.140 --> 07:07.560
So it was funny.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
Anyhow.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.600
You know what?

07:09.600 --> 07:13.080
We should actually, we don't have that footage cause we could totally redo it as a silent

07:13.080 --> 07:14.080
picture.

07:14.080 --> 07:17.620
So eat gads, the table has fallen.

07:17.620 --> 07:23.880
So this week on orangelaunchradio.com, our website, Dark Tetsuya, who bless, bless his

07:23.880 --> 07:24.880
heart.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.320
He's like the only person that's actually writing content for the site right now.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.720
And I know I'm thinking I need to make a new year's resolution.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.420
I'm saying a new year of OLRs resolution actually write content for the website because it's

07:34.420 --> 07:37.520
it's we need to get more people visiting orange launch radio.com and posting on our forums

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
and stuff.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.920
And I think a lot of that comes with content, but a dark Tetsuya had a lot of fun reading

07:41.920 --> 07:47.320
the blast from the past that were on there this week, the where are they now series that

07:47.320 --> 07:51.760
he was doing where, you know, a lot of, a lot of people, and I get not everybody listening

07:51.760 --> 07:56.840
to the podcast now would get it quote unquote, because by the time we were actually in iTunes

07:56.840 --> 08:01.980
as a podcast, we had moved on from being just a show about dance dance revolution and beat

08:01.980 --> 08:05.200
media to DX and the tournament scene and so, so forth and all of that.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.960
So I get a lot of people didn't really follow the scene in those days, but it was kind of

08:08.960 --> 08:11.640
fun to read about what's happened to a lot of those people.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.380
Of course, you can't mention the money culture without get it, stop it.

08:16.380 --> 08:20.000
But one of the people that was interviewed was Jessica, and you can read her article

08:20.000 --> 08:25.240
up on there and see what she's been up to, or she'll just tell us about it tonight.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.560
It's not like it was that much more than you guys already know.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
Yeah.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.160
I think actually the last time I was here, you got a heck of a lot more juicy stuff than

08:33.160 --> 08:35.080
you ever possibly could on me.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.000
Well, I know one thing you've done since the last time you were on the show is you actually

08:39.000 --> 08:41.280
went to the place where we all used to hang out.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.360
You went to Roseville Golf Land, which over the years we've called the place where video

08:45.360 --> 08:50.760
games go to die because we've slowly watched this arcade that used to be like our, our

08:50.760 --> 08:56.160
turf, so to speak, just slowly morph into gambling machines for children that spit out

08:56.160 --> 08:57.160
tickets.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
Yeah.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.160
And nothing else.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.120
And what did you feel walking into Roseville Golf Land and just kind of seeing it now?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.120
I wanted to cry.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.120
Did you?

09:04.120 --> 09:05.120
I really did.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.680
It was just pathetic.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.960
You walk in and it previously, one of the only reasons why I would still even go there

09:10.960 --> 09:18.120
was because there, there was a 2DX machine for a period of time there, it's gone.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.040
There's still two DDR machines.

09:20.040 --> 09:24.720
They're now in a back corner, tucked away where people like to walk over the pads even

09:24.720 --> 09:27.560
more so than they did when they were prominently displayed towards the middle.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.360
And keep in mind, Roseville Golf Land is also a water park.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.400
So a lot of times during the summer that will be wet feet walking over electronic machines.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
Exactly.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
Genius people out in Roseville.

09:36.400 --> 09:42.720
Or playing on the machines with their wet feet and leaving all of their water behind.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.400
The only machines that are there, you have an extreme machine.

09:46.400 --> 09:52.280
I'm sorry, Max2 and Disney's Rave.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.040
And that's it for DDR.

09:54.040 --> 09:58.320
And Drummania, there's no drumsticks.

09:58.320 --> 10:07.120
There's a stool that's attached by a big, huge metal chain so that you can't move it.

10:07.120 --> 10:13.080
And the Guitar Freaks controllers were upside down and on the floor when I looked at it.

10:13.080 --> 10:19.040
But oh, of course, they had to have newer style machines.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
Everything else was okay.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.120
Plus a big, huge Tetris machine, which I don't understand.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.120
I played that.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.120
Yeah.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.120
That thing's frightening.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.120
And hard to control.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.760
Wait, Tetris is back in the arcade?

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
What?

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
It's a huge mungus.

10:30.760 --> 10:31.760
It's a big ball.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.760
What?

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
I took a picture of it.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.760
The controller's a big ball.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
Hold on, let me find my picture of it because I took a picture.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.280
It's a Tetris game that's a giant ball.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.840
Each controller is a huge ball and the screen is like twice my height.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.840
Yeah.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.320
And there's a button on each side of the ball and to move things, you have to move the ball

10:47.320 --> 10:48.760
around with your hands.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.000
It's awkward Tetris.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Awkward Tetris.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
That's exactly...

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Well, it really is.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
It's awkward.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
It's hard to play too.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Awkward, phallic Tetris.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
No.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.480
With about half the size of the normal amount of lines or actually a third of the amount

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
of lines that you would normally have.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.440
And it's still kind of hard to get any at all because it's like, oh, you want it here?

11:05.440 --> 11:09.680
Well, we're going to move you one block over because it does not center.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.680
Yeah.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.160
We've got some comments in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.160
Let's see.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.680
SSGA 100 Matt says, every golf land is like that though.

11:16.680 --> 11:21.840
Yeah, but every golf land is not in Roseville and Roseville is a special place because everyone

11:21.840 --> 11:23.120
there is privileged.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
Yeah.

11:24.120 --> 11:29.020
Keep in mind that all of these horrible things that are happening to the arcade are complete

11:29.020 --> 11:35.600
opposite as to what's happening to every other portion of the golf land sun splash experience.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.520
You have sun splash, which just keeps on growing and they keep getting more rides.

11:39.520 --> 11:47.560
And now there's this giant two level parking garage area so that everybody and their little

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
brother can park.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.400
I do appreciate the fact that they have more parking because it was annoying having the

11:52.400 --> 11:56.480
park like in and out in order to make it to sun splash.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.480
You had to hike in.

11:57.480 --> 11:58.480
During summertime, yeah.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.480
Yes.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.480
The rest of the year was no problem.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.480
No.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.480
Here it is.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.280
And see, that's the thing too is they forget, hey, you know, it does get cool at some point

12:06.280 --> 12:09.640
and you can't ride the, you know, slides.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.120
Hey, it's a Sega game.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.240
It's Tetris by Sega.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.000
That's kind of neat.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.120
It's Tetris giant.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.120
Interesting.

12:16.120 --> 12:21.120
And there's the ball and the ball is seriously like the size of my head.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.360
Also in our chat room, uh, chat.orangewonnage.com, the Rob D says, ski ball is also bring your

12:25.360 --> 12:26.520
own ski balls.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.800
Actually, I did play around a ski ball last time I was at our vehicle and you know how

12:30.800 --> 12:34.720
like a bunch of balls are supposed to come down like nine balls, but if the machine is

12:34.720 --> 12:38.440
short and it only give like three balls and then it'll keep refilling.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.440
I had two.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.440
Yeah.

12:40.440 --> 12:44.840
So I had to literally wait after I would throw two balls for, I did play a ski ball while

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
I was there.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.840
Okay.

12:46.840 --> 12:51.520
Um, the one on the very far left, it would shoot out a bunch of tickets at you, but then

12:51.520 --> 12:54.400
if you, it didn't matter what you scored, there would be no more tickets that would

12:54.400 --> 12:55.400
come out.

12:55.400 --> 13:00.800
Whereas any of the other ones would give you like three initial tickets and then it was

13:00.800 --> 13:02.300
based on score from that point on.

13:02.300 --> 13:06.400
So if you really want, you know, unless you were really, really good at ski ball, you

13:06.400 --> 13:11.760
always want to go to the one on the left because it shoots out something insane like 18 tickets.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.240
Orange Lounge Radio giving you the pro tips.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.240
Exactly.

13:15.240 --> 13:19.420
Well, and the whole reason why I ended up resorting to the little kiddie gambling games

13:19.420 --> 13:24.480
is because I had this card that had something to the tune of about a hundred credits on

13:24.480 --> 13:25.480
it.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.480
And that's right.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
They went through the card system.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.680
That's how long it's been since I've gone there.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.480
I think I have tokens still.

13:30.480 --> 13:35.160
Yeah, I think at one point in time I tossed a $20 bill on to get a card so that I could

13:35.160 --> 13:40.320
play 2DX and I played for like an hour that one day and went, oh, I'll just go ahead and

13:40.320 --> 13:42.520
save this card and bring it back for next time.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.400
And this was the next time.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.640
Speaking of which, Rob, do you remember, uh, remember I was going to Dave and Buster's

13:47.640 --> 13:49.080
like the first year we went to E3?

13:49.080 --> 13:51.360
I'm still using that damn card.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.800
Like I don't go there ever.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.720
And I had like, I had to go for the two for one arcade night or whatever it's called.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.840
Um, yes, 23 Maggots.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.840
Stop doing that.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.840
All right.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.840
Drew Nami, intern Drew, whatever.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.560
I, I, I, I grew up, dammit.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.640
I swear to God I grew up just not much.

14:07.640 --> 14:12.640
No, I still have my, uh, my Dave and Buster's card from when I went there the first time

14:12.640 --> 14:14.920
for one of Jamie's birthdays.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.200
Yay.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.560
Like back in the day when I used to go every year.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.560
Yeah.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.760
Back in the day where I still couldn't have a drink.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.880
Oh.

14:22.880 --> 14:26.440
So before we get into our gaming weeks, which is how we're usually supposed to start off

14:26.440 --> 14:28.600
the show, but you know, it's a birthday show.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
Just deal.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.920
Uh, I want to talk, cause we were talking about turf and how the Rosewood Golf needs

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
to be our turf.

14:33.920 --> 14:37.960
But I got to tell you one of my favorite just memories of the past nine years when it comes

14:37.960 --> 14:44.240
to when arcades are actually fun and that would be as ghetto fuck as it is, Scandia

14:44.240 --> 14:48.120
Family Fun Entertainment Center, because I'm just going to say it, we own that fucking

14:48.120 --> 14:49.840
joint for a short period of time.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.520
Oh yeah, we did fucking, that was our turf.

14:53.520 --> 14:59.120
The whole reason is, you know, when you get friendly, when you befriend the game tech,

14:59.120 --> 15:03.880
the game tech manager, then you own everything and that was the only reason why we had such

15:03.880 --> 15:09.360
a good time at Roseville after a while was because he got moved over there and started

15:09.360 --> 15:10.360
working over there.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.340
We're like, Hey, you know, could you put a good word in for the Milwaukee games for us?

15:13.340 --> 15:19.720
But nowhere was it more apparent that we fucking owned Scandia than, than that tournament that

15:19.720 --> 15:20.720
we had there.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.400
The two tournaments, I don't even remember.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
We did March Madness.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.400
Okay.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.760
I want to see the other one, which is normally a barrier tournament.

15:28.760 --> 15:35.200
I'm telling you, we monopolized the birthday party room with our room where we were deep

15:35.200 --> 15:37.680
frying Twinkies and selling them.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.680
Why?

15:38.680 --> 15:44.720
Because we know because it sounded funny because Justin B thought it would be a good idea.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.960
The hell ever happened to that kid?

15:45.960 --> 15:46.960
I don't know.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.520
He doesn't use, I think he like remixes remixing stuff.

15:49.520 --> 15:54.000
So we need to get him to one of the songs, one cage match once.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.280
And don't forget that for shaft, the pad broke.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.280
I do.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.280
I do remember that.

16:00.280 --> 16:04.640
And I had to run back home and go get my hard mounted soft pads.

16:04.640 --> 16:08.640
If that tells you how old school this is, kids, there was no such thing as a cobalt

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
flux back then.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
It's hard.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
Yeah.

16:11.640 --> 16:17.880
It was my custom hard mounted soft pads that we ended up using for one of the routines

16:17.880 --> 16:18.880
for the competition.

16:18.880 --> 16:19.880
Good times.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.000
I beat my first nine footer on those pads.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Me too, actually.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.480
Or no, my second, I think my second, I think my second was on those pads.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.480
I beat my first nine footer.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.280
But, um, yeah, I mean, and then I remember there was the little gazebo that was out there

16:30.280 --> 16:35.900
before you could go out to the golf course and just, it was all the, you know, Bay area

16:35.900 --> 16:39.480
DER people just took over that place and like families are trying to come in there and stuff

16:39.480 --> 16:42.240
and we get scared off by the conversation that was going on.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.560
I mean, it's just, we, we re we ruled the school there.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.560
It was awesome.

16:46.560 --> 16:51.000
I'm pulling out with random tunic tunic tunes and yes, except for the batting cages, those

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
we didn't touch.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.320
And then you remember like all the bad things that happened to that place, like the time

16:55.320 --> 16:59.160
that they took it to the best of Sacramento or something like that and the speakers fell

16:59.160 --> 17:06.080
off or the marquee fell off of the thing and they put like boombox speakers up there or

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
something.

17:07.080 --> 17:12.560
Although I do remember that we, we had the donated subwoofer for 2DX that would vibrate

17:12.560 --> 17:13.560
your knees.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.560
Yes.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.800
That was awesome.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.920
It was great too, is that, um, because we knew the arcade tax, uh, a DDR fourth mix

17:20.920 --> 17:23.200
machine would load edits that you made at home.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.320
You could actually save a limited number of edits on the machine and he used, he would

17:26.320 --> 17:27.320
load our edits.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.680
And I remember we had, uh, I, or at least I don't know if me or you, we had an edit

17:31.680 --> 17:38.680
for kick the can called big cans, all it was so, so you could fire up big cans and you'd

17:38.680 --> 17:41.600
see it on the machine now playing big cans.

17:41.600 --> 17:45.440
And what it was is that it would start for like, you know, the song started with this

17:45.440 --> 17:49.840
fun little dance for like four measures and it was just a giant break in the song.

17:49.840 --> 17:55.160
So people would literally start big cans, play the first four measures, run a lap around

17:55.160 --> 18:04.820
the entire arcade and get back just in time to hit that last don't remember that the hell

18:04.820 --> 18:08.840
at it competitions too, which I've won lots of good porn that way.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.680
Make it, make it and get porn.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.680
Yeah, it was awesome.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.600
That was one of the, that was one of the early things on OLR.

18:14.600 --> 18:19.280
I remember someone, someone passed my hell at it, my DXYM hell at it.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.400
That was, it was that skinny kid, Dave.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
He won.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
Sign and beat it.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.400
He won.

18:25.400 --> 18:30.880
When we went on the moderator trip for DDR freak back when sign and beat it, I bought

18:30.880 --> 18:36.720
him dinner and we, we, we can't forget the awesomeness that was a chaff that was a Wendell's

18:36.720 --> 18:39.000
famous roast beef routine.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.220
Yes.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.900
And we of course can't forget the travesty that was my attempt at freestyle, which we

18:44.900 --> 18:46.640
shall never hear of again.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.640
God damn it.

18:47.640 --> 18:52.360
Wasn't that the first time I ever did my Dr. Dick character too?

18:52.360 --> 18:53.360
Yes.

18:53.360 --> 18:58.080
Imagine me doing drag, but not doing drag, that was my Dr. Dick character that I would

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
do.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.760
Didn't Dr. Dick eventually though turn into Mr. Spanky?

19:02.760 --> 19:03.760
On the, on OLR.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.320
So OLR is the spiritual successor to all of that.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.920
Like Rob, but gayer.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.920
Anyway.

19:08.920 --> 19:09.920
All right.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
Look, we got to get into...

19:10.920 --> 19:11.920
There's gayer than Rob?

19:11.920 --> 19:12.920
Hey.

19:12.920 --> 19:13.920
All right.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.920
We got to get into...

19:14.920 --> 19:15.920
Oh girl.

19:15.920 --> 19:16.920
I'm sorry.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.540
That's still supposed to come in a couple of weeks.

19:18.540 --> 19:20.440
That's when I get to start attacking you again.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.840
I can't wait.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
I guess I have to play nice.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.840
This is a warm up.

19:23.840 --> 19:24.840
Warm up.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.840
Oh boy.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
Oh no, no.

19:26.840 --> 19:27.840
You can continue.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
I'm enjoying it.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.840
I'll just sit back here and go, writing this down.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
He's like crap.

19:30.840 --> 19:31.940
Now I remember what it was like.

19:31.940 --> 19:36.480
So if you think our reminiscing tonight is bad over nine years ago and everything we

19:36.480 --> 19:40.960
were doing back then, just wait until next year because I'm telling you, we're renting

19:40.960 --> 19:45.880
the Masonic Lodge or something and we're just gonna, we're gonna rule the school and get

19:45.880 --> 19:47.360
everybody in one place.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.480
Get out all the DDR pads, have like an OLR con or something.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.960
That's my dream for a 10th anniversary thing.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.480
And get everybody in one roof and just blow the roof off the place.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.480
Be fun.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.480
Good times.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.000
This is our awesome sack anime panel that we did.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Eight in the morning.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
About three years ago.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.960
Oh, that was so, I think I like had like a double coffee.

20:08.960 --> 20:09.960
Literally two people showed up.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.960
Yeah, you and one other kid.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.840
But you know what I got out of that whole thing?

20:13.840 --> 20:14.840
My Dalek.

20:14.840 --> 20:15.840
All right.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.680
I have that on reserve for you, Jamie.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.680
Let's move on guys.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.600
Let's get into your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.440
Nine years later, what are the console games or PC games making up your week?

20:27.440 --> 20:28.440
Dark soccer.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.440
Wow.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.440
Damn it.

20:30.440 --> 20:36.920
But I'm actually going to be getting myself a month card for Star Trek online so that

20:36.920 --> 20:42.120
my Scottish fleet mates will not keep harassing me.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.120
Are they missing you?

20:43.120 --> 20:44.120
They miss me.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
Well, okay.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.720
One of my fleet mates is on my Facebook and he's such a nice guy.

20:48.720 --> 20:53.040
He's actually the first person that I met in game there that I chatted with other than

20:53.040 --> 21:00.880
someone who was actually role playing Captain Jack Harkness from Torchwood, which was gorgeous.

21:00.880 --> 21:05.400
But we, we, we just ended up chatting and we were the same level and we kept playing

21:05.400 --> 21:09.760
and then he got me into the fleet and I was like, Ooh, I get to listen to Scottish men's.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.000
That's awesome.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.600
So I might be getting a month on STO before the fun's going to dry.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
All right.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.680
So thinking about more MMOs to go play.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.680
Initial D extreme stage.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.260
We're going to have news later on tonight about a pretty big MMO that is going free

21:26.260 --> 21:27.460
to play.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.960
So I'm curious if that's going to be something you're going to want to go to as well.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.160
It'd be interesting to see just free MMOs are good.

21:33.160 --> 21:39.040
Except for Ragnarok online, which I played for what, nine years in various forms of,

21:39.040 --> 21:43.300
well, when I started playing, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.620
When I started playing, I started on the Korean beta.

21:46.620 --> 21:51.980
So I was playing on the Korean servers for free because it was in beta.

21:51.980 --> 21:55.080
And then I played on the Japanese servers when they kicked us out of the Korean servers.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.600
And then I played on the American servers when we finally got them.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.980
And I played all the way up until it went pay to play.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.840
And then I actually started paying for it.

22:01.840 --> 22:07.800
And then I went to private servers because the mods were jerk faces and would do random

22:07.800 --> 22:09.080
attacks on the towns.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.080
Yeah.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.080
I remember that.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.080
You dragged my ass into it.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
I couldn't leave town.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.080
Yeah.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.080
You can't leave town because you'll just...

22:15.080 --> 22:16.080
Oh, dead.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
Oh, because it was Halloween.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
Ooh.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
Oop, dead.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
That's fun.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
Walk alone.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.800
And then the whole thing is like, oh, you're walking alone.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
Oop, dead.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.800
We're putting a random mob there.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
Yeah.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
How about no?

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
Yeah.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
So no more RO for me.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
All right.

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
Well, let's go over...

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
Oh.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
One more thing.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
Okay.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.000
Lots of peggle in WoW.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.200
Because I've been sitting my ass in queue for 35 minutes a pop because I like DPS too

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
much.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
Done.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.200
All right.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.200
Loki, how was your gaming week?

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
It was okay.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
I didn't play a whole lot this week.

22:46.200 --> 22:51.600
I played, let's see, some more Child of Eden, which is, it's pretty awesome.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.080
I actually got to play it on the HGTV this time.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.700
It does get quite difficult when you're using the controller, like about even like the third

22:58.700 --> 23:00.840
level in or whatever.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.080
So I'm actually looking forward to trying it with the Kinect.

23:03.080 --> 23:08.640
I think it'll be a lot more accurate.

23:08.640 --> 23:13.080
Played a bit of Shadows of the Damned, which is a very strange game.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.120
And there's lots of penis references all throughout the game.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.440
Just the entire fucking game is just penis references.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.440
But it's cool.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.960
Where can I buy this game?

23:23.960 --> 23:25.960
At your local store.

23:25.960 --> 23:26.960
It's basically Suda51.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.140
I mean, well, there you go.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.140
That's why.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.140
It's all crazy.

23:31.140 --> 23:38.560
Suda51, the guy that created Resident Evil, and Akira Yamaoka doing the soundtrack.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.840
It's pretty awesome, though.

23:39.840 --> 23:46.320
It's kind of a third person action game where your girlfriend gets, you're a demon hunter

23:46.320 --> 23:48.720
and your girlfriend gets killed.

23:48.720 --> 23:55.360
And basically this demon lord takes her into hell and you have to go after him.

23:55.360 --> 24:00.200
And they're calling it a road, was it like a road trip movie in hell.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.520
We actually have a clip from the game.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.600
This is Shadows of the Damned.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.960
This is a clip actually from the Akira Yamaoka soundtrack.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.400
I know a lot of you have been eagerly anticipating hearing some of the soundtrack.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.400
Here you go.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.840
Gentlemen, here's a little number I tossed off recently in the Caribbean.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.760
Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?

24:17.760 --> 24:20.480
Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong?

24:20.480 --> 24:21.760
It's swell to have a stiffy.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.320
It's divine to own a dick.

24:23.320 --> 24:27.000
From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.560
So three cheers for your Willie or John Thomas.

24:29.560 --> 24:35.120
Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake, your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your

24:35.120 --> 24:40.280
pussy or your cock, you can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock, but

24:40.280 --> 24:44.440
don't take it out in public or they will stick you in the dock and you won't.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
Come back.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.160
Thank you very much.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.160
There you go.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
That's Akira Yamaoka.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.160
It's a weird direction he's going in now with his music.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.400
You know what, Rob?

24:52.400 --> 24:58.880
I used to, it was me and a bunch of my friends would go to the one Denny's in Mobile, Alabama

24:58.880 --> 25:05.480
and sing this as loud as we could around 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock after we were done doing

25:05.480 --> 25:10.240
whatever it was that we little degenerates were doing, you know, like there's shit to

25:10.240 --> 25:12.080
do in Mobile, Alabama.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.240
Except play live action vampire.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
LARP.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
LARP.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.400
Naturally you pick the Denny's because that shit will get you kicked out of Waffle House.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.600
Yeah, that will get you kicked out of Waffle House.

25:22.600 --> 25:32.600
You laugh at that rendition of that song there, but actually your gun, which is Johnson, yes,

25:32.600 --> 25:37.560
he keeps referring to as Johnson the entire time, actually the voice is very similar.

25:37.560 --> 25:44.360
All right, so you've been playing Penis of the Damned and what, two penises up or?

25:44.360 --> 25:45.360
It's awesome.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.360
It's a pretty fun game.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.600
I'm actually looking forward to, no, I'm never going to finish this game.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
You know why?

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
Because Earth Defense Force.

25:51.600 --> 25:56.680
So, Insect Armageddon is going to be coming out, not next week, but the week after.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.640
But hey, you know what, I don't know if I can get it early.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.680
And that's all I'll be playing at the end of this next week.

26:01.680 --> 26:06.240
So I don't care about finishing this game or anything else because this game will take

26:06.240 --> 26:07.240
over my life.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.240
Great.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.920
So when we ask you about your gaming week for the next six months, it's going to be,

26:09.920 --> 26:11.080
ah, I played Insect Armageddon.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.020
What if, what if, what if, what if it sucks?

26:14.020 --> 26:15.020
It's going to suck.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.720
The first game sucked, but it was fun.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.720
That was the whole point.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.480
Rob, let's just give you the complete view of that game right away.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.240
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.240
There.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.240
That's your review.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.240
Thank you.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.240
Somebody, somebody crop me a sound clip of that.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.240
There's actually, um.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.240
When he moves.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.240
There's some weird shit in there.

26:30.240 --> 26:34.800
Like, for example, you go, you have to shoot goat heads in order to get light to show,

26:34.800 --> 26:35.960
um, show up.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.240
And also, uh, there's these baby faces.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.800
You have to feed giant strawberries and eyeballs too.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.520
Oh, fun.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.720
I want this game.

26:44.720 --> 26:45.720
It's pretty awesome.

26:45.720 --> 26:46.720
All right.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.560
Uh, I believe your husband will have it soon.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.560
Really?

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
Wow.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.560
You're a profit.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.280
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.120
Uh, Grand Theft Auto.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
All right.

26:58.120 --> 27:02.040
Almost, almost made it a whole week where I was just on a winning streak the entire

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
week.

27:03.040 --> 27:07.800
I did lose one game in the middle of there and I was out today, so I'll try next week.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.800
I know.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.400
It's, it's, it's this, sorry, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.980
Uh, this is this, this is like bubble wrap.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.720
It's like the world's biggest bubble wrap, but you can't pop the bubbles.

27:17.720 --> 27:22.400
So I keep sitting here trying to pop the bubbles on this world's biggest bubble wrap and they

27:22.400 --> 27:27.320
don't, they don't pop just don't, if you rip into it, that's cheating.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.760
You can't use your nails.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.520
I could pop it, but I'm all right.

27:30.520 --> 27:36.840
I don't want to ruin that piece of any house that can ruin that piece of bubble wrap.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
This is great radio.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.520
The sound of no, no, no, no, no, that's cheating.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
That is cheating with scissors.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
All right.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.520
My house.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.520
I can cheat.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.520
Can you picture that and put it on the website?

27:45.520 --> 27:50.760
So at least there's some, all you would have had to do is just roll it up into a ball and

27:50.760 --> 27:51.760
it would have worked.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.000
I don't see why twisting it would be cheating though.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.960
All right, Jessica, I know you don't, Oh my gosh, she got one.

27:57.960 --> 27:58.960
That's what I said.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.960
You twist it.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
Wow.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.880
All right, Jessica, I know you don't just play DDR.

28:03.880 --> 28:04.880
I play DDR.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.800
You know why I won't do?

28:07.800 --> 28:10.220
Because look at it, it's not just one bubble.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.220
It's multi-bubble.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.960
Enough with the bubble wrap.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.720
We're playing, you know, a game right now.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.920
I was trying to understand the physics behind it, Rob.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.920
Don't you ever watch Mr. Wizard's World?

28:18.920 --> 28:19.920
Don't you ever want to know?

28:19.920 --> 28:20.920
He's dead, Jamie.

28:20.920 --> 28:21.920
And he hated children.

28:21.920 --> 28:30.200
Anyway, Jessica, how was your gaming week?

28:30.200 --> 28:36.900
I played what I always play, lots and lots and lots of lotro and lots and lots of lotro

28:36.900 --> 28:37.900
and more lotro.

28:37.900 --> 28:40.920
Dude, what is it with chicks and MMOs?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.920
Okay, dealer.

28:43.920 --> 28:48.720
It's funny you guys were talking about the whole, you know, free MMO thing because lotro

28:48.720 --> 28:51.880
is a free MMO, though I am a subscriber.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.220
And I think it was a good thing for them to do because they brought in a lot of people

28:55.220 --> 28:59.280
and it was because of bringing in those people that they gained more of an audience for their

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
subscriptions.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.280
So.

29:01.280 --> 29:08.840
Out of curiosity, when lotro went free to play, did a lot of the existing fan base say,

29:08.840 --> 29:12.320
we're going to reject these free people and this is going to be horrible and we don't

29:12.320 --> 29:14.560
want new people coming into our turf?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.320
Like was it received with a bunch of negativity?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.360
Well, I wasn't on at that point in time.

29:18.360 --> 29:24.000
I came in a little bit after that, but I did, I do hear even to this day, oh, well, everything

29:24.000 --> 29:28.880
changed when we went free to play, you know, the types of people that were playing now

29:28.880 --> 29:33.280
are completely different and so hard to, you know, and I can understand that, you know,

29:33.280 --> 29:38.800
you're going to end up with a lot more of a crowd that is flaky.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.440
If people have their money, you know, put into a game, then yeah, they're a little bit

29:42.440 --> 29:45.000
more indebted to, they're going to, they're going to play it more often.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.840
Just makes sense.

29:46.840 --> 29:52.480
That said, I too have a Star Trek online account that I pay for monthly that just sits there

29:52.480 --> 29:55.440
with my level 10 Lieutenant Commander.

29:55.440 --> 29:59.840
So it's, you know, it doesn't really matter all the time.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.400
You're still going to have the same type of flaky people.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.940
It's I don't know.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.160
It's topical because it's something else going on this week.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.160
That's why I asked.

30:07.160 --> 30:12.600
But the main thing is we're getting ready right now for Isengard is going to be the

30:12.600 --> 30:14.000
next update in September.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.340
So everybody's doing their pre-purchase and you get your snazzy stuff, like your snazzy

30:18.340 --> 30:21.840
horse or your snazzy outfit and everything.

30:21.840 --> 30:26.960
But the one thing I like is I get a 25% XP buff on any of my characters that are below

30:26.960 --> 30:28.540
the level cap.

30:28.540 --> 30:33.640
And for me, who's right there, just barely below the level cap, that helps gives me that

30:33.640 --> 30:34.640
little extra push.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.640
Awesome.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.680
Will that bring you up?

30:37.680 --> 30:38.680
Huh?

30:38.680 --> 30:39.680
Will that bring you up to the level?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.880
Well, no, I'm still working on it.

30:41.880 --> 30:47.720
It's just a 25% extra buff so that you're gaining 25% more XP per kill.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.200
Plus on top of it, we're in the middle of the summer festival.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.700
So you automatically are getting a buff from that as well on XP.

30:53.700 --> 31:00.240
So any kills that I've made this weekend are basically just, I'm getting mad, mad XP from.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.240
Cool.

31:01.240 --> 31:05.960
Let me ask this because Lord of the Rings really isn't big in pop culture right now.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.340
I mean, it was a few years ago when the movies were coming out, but obviously it's always

31:09.340 --> 31:10.760
going to have its fan base.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.440
But the reason why I say that is because we have these Hobbit movies that are on the horizon.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.760
We're hearing more about that.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.920
That's going to kind of bring more attention back in pop culture to the all things Lord

31:19.920 --> 31:21.740
of the Rings and Tolkien and all that.

31:21.740 --> 31:25.400
So how do you think the MMO will be impacted by the Hobbit?

31:25.400 --> 31:30.840
Oh, I would not be surprised if you would end up seeing a huge surge of people that

31:30.840 --> 31:33.160
were going to start joining after that.

31:33.160 --> 31:38.200
On top of that, we're also seeing a lot of people right now because movie theaters all

31:38.200 --> 31:45.160
across the country are showing the original movies on big screen one night per week.

31:45.160 --> 31:49.480
So last week they did the original, now they're doing Two Towers this week, and next week's

31:49.480 --> 31:50.480
going to be...

31:50.480 --> 31:52.040
Yeah, Dan's going to that on Tuesday.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.040
Yeah.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.220
So that in and of itself is getting a lot more interest.

31:56.220 --> 31:59.520
So I look forward to it.

31:59.520 --> 32:07.260
The kinship that I'm a part of is very newbie friendly and we like to be able to help each

32:07.260 --> 32:12.240
other kind of move on in the game and we welcome anybody no matter if they're paid to play

32:12.240 --> 32:14.760
or not in our kinship.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.760
So yay, go Arlequins.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.760
Yay.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.320
It's very warm and fuzzy and friendly.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.320
And it helps too.

32:20.320 --> 32:26.560
It helps too because not only do I have two of my old coworkers in my kinship, the leader

32:26.560 --> 32:31.160
is somebody that I knew from IRC that I met like way back in the day.

32:31.160 --> 32:35.840
So it's really kind of spiffy that I get to have that kind of connection with two completely

32:35.840 --> 32:38.000
different portions of my life at the same time.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Awesome.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
MMOs, bringing people together.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
There you go.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
All right.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.080
Drunami, anything you want to say about your gaming week and what you've been playing?

32:45.080 --> 32:49.660
I've been playing a bunch of the WoW crack and not really encountering those insane queue

32:49.660 --> 32:52.320
times because I play a healer.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.320
But I can understand.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.320
What kind of healer are you?

32:54.320 --> 32:58.480
I main a priest, but I'm starting up a shaman lately.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.480
You're a 40, right?

32:59.480 --> 33:00.480
Holy Pally's the best.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.480
Yeah.

33:01.480 --> 33:06.360
I never really got into the Holy Pally stuff, but aside from that, I've been playing a lot

33:06.360 --> 33:17.360
of Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War 2, Retribution, Electric Boogaloo over too many subtitles.

33:17.360 --> 33:23.320
And speaking of games that have gone free to play or have been free to play for a while,

33:23.320 --> 33:27.120
Steam kind of kicked off some stuff and I kind of got into making a Champions Online

33:27.120 --> 33:30.560
character trying to get into the whole Silver Age thing.

33:30.560 --> 33:36.160
I'm like, yeah, I heard Champions Online kind of tepid, like a lot of people weren't really

33:36.160 --> 33:37.160
into it when it first came out.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.960
Then it went free to play and suddenly way more people were into it.

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
I was in the beta.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.960
It got better.

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
It got better.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.960
Not great, but it got better.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.320
But I started up a grimoire named 23.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.320
Derp.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.320
Numerologist.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.320
Yay.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.760
And a lot of people too with that game forget that they were going to put that on 360 and

33:54.760 --> 33:57.200
then at the last minute, it just didn't end up happening.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.480
But it's funny because if you plug in an Xbox 360, Alan told me about this, you plug in

34:00.480 --> 34:02.800
a 360 controller, it will show.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
It works.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.920
Yeah, everything shows up with the Xbox buttons and everything.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.720
But not very well.

34:07.720 --> 34:08.720
I tried.

34:08.720 --> 34:12.760
I actually had to struggle to get it not to recognize 360 control and let me use the damn

34:12.760 --> 34:19.080
keyboard because I have my controller plugged in all the time.

34:19.080 --> 34:23.280
But aside from that, you know, wow, Dawn of War, Champions Online, I haven't really been

34:23.280 --> 34:24.280
playing much.

34:24.280 --> 34:29.600
I've been thinking about getting back into playing some Wii games I'd set on the shelf.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.120
Playing through No More Heroes 2 again.

34:32.120 --> 34:37.400
And just kind of going through my game archive stuff I hadn't finished.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.400
Rogue Galaxy.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.480
That's what I'm doing right now.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.520
Shadow Hearts from the New World.

34:41.520 --> 34:44.640
Just some older PS2 stuff because I'm a broke ass like that.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.640
Alright.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.960
Well, there you go.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.720
Lots of archive gaming and free gaming.

34:49.720 --> 34:55.800
Yeah, also scaring the crap out of myself with Dead Space but that's another story altogether.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.840
Let's see, my gaming week quickly and then we'll get into the gaming news.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.600
I actually don't have a lot to add to my gaming week this week.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.340
It's really the same games.

35:02.340 --> 35:05.920
It's funny because I've been gaming a lot but I have nothing new to share with you all

35:05.920 --> 35:09.120
because I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 13.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.200
I'm finally to the point where the game has opened up and if you've played through 13

35:13.200 --> 35:15.920
you know exactly what point of the game I'm talking about.

35:15.920 --> 35:19.960
You know, that took many, many hours to get there but I'm actually really into it and

35:19.960 --> 35:22.260
again, I don't get the 13 hate.

35:22.260 --> 35:24.600
This is seriously one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.680
I like it more Nate, that's for sure.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.400
So I'm having a great time with it.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.440
So I am going to play it through to completion.

35:30.440 --> 35:37.500
That is because even though yes, some of the characters are just so cliche and annoying,

35:37.500 --> 35:41.920
I really, really have a boner for Fang who is an amazing character.

35:41.920 --> 35:42.920
Love her.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.160
So, strong woman.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.160
Like her.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.600
I'm like, I'm just playing for Fang at this point.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.600
She's great.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
And I like lightning too.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.160
Is that Fang service?

35:51.160 --> 35:52.160
Yes.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.040
It's Fang service.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.000
I see Drunami is rubbing off on you.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
All right.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Anyhow.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
He's sitting next to me.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
I'm getting infected.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Anyhow.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Also, you know, Warcraft.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.720
Mortal Kombat played online for a little bit with Extrofer from the other show Horde House.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.600
I was playing, yes, he's really getting into Mortal Kombat.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.600
It's really funny.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.440
Like he's almost beat story mode, I think.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.840
So we were sparring a little bit.

36:13.840 --> 36:18.640
So that was fun because I like playing with Extrofer because like I know who it is and

36:18.640 --> 36:22.720
it's not just some anonymous face who is kicking my ass.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.440
But Extrofer and I are pretty evenly matched.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.060
So it's actually kind of fun to play him online.

36:26.060 --> 36:29.360
So I'm thankful to like no more people playing Mortal Kombat online.

36:29.360 --> 36:32.000
So otherwise, nothing really new to share.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.400
Hopefully in the coming weeks I will.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.000
I actually have some racing games sitting at home that came from my rental service that

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
I'm waiting to play.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.280
So I'm hoping I'll have a Need for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited 2 things to say in the

36:42.280 --> 36:44.600
coming weeks because I have both of those sitting at home.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.200
I want to know who the fuck Penis Man is.

36:48.200 --> 36:54.180
Again, one of those sound clips I'd like to save to a sound board and use on a rainy day

36:54.180 --> 36:55.180
sometime.

36:55.180 --> 36:59.040
Chat.orangelandre.com if you would like to offend Dark Soccer with your name.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.760
It's Break Man.

37:00.760 --> 37:05.760
Anyhow, let's move on to, we're going to get into gaming news, but first some housekeeping

37:05.760 --> 37:06.760
tonight.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
Good lord, it's been nine years.

37:07.760 --> 37:12.000
If you haven't already, you really should follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R

37:12.000 --> 37:16.600
and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.680
And yeah, please join us on those sites.

37:19.680 --> 37:24.280
And of course, I want to plug one more time, Jess Carper is here tonight to help plug Under

37:24.280 --> 37:28.740
Sedation Live, which is the show that was before Orange Lounge Radio, it was actually

37:28.740 --> 37:29.740
on that show.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.680
That was a show born of the Rocky Horror community.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.760
I don't think a lot of people know that.

37:33.760 --> 37:37.520
But that was a show, like this was born of DDR, that show was born of Rocky Horror and

37:37.520 --> 37:43.880
now it's kind of all things sci-fi geekery what the fuck every plus video games tossed

37:43.880 --> 37:44.880
in there too.

37:44.880 --> 37:45.880
Yes.

37:45.880 --> 37:46.880
Plus, and then video games tossed in there too.

37:46.880 --> 37:52.560
So and of course, under station lives on Saturday nights at eight o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
Eastern.

37:53.560 --> 37:54.560
So it's a late show.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
Yes.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.560
And the website.

37:56.560 --> 38:01.600
It's understationlive.org and Travis actually just revamped the entire website this week.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.020
And on top of that, he just updated all of the podcasts.

38:05.020 --> 38:12.880
So now everything is up there, up to week before last.

38:12.880 --> 38:17.600
He didn't do last week's because it was a solo show because I was out and about.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.960
So yeah, basically everything through episode 36 is up on the web.

38:20.960 --> 38:21.960
Great.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.960
Because I need to catch up because, you know, it's tough.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.480
With having this show on Sunday night, Saturday night, it's usually my night to, you know,

38:27.480 --> 38:28.480
go do stuff.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.640
Oh, you will definitely want to, I think 35 or 36.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.640
Definitely.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
All right.

38:33.640 --> 38:37.080
So we're doing some pre-ten year anniversary reminiscing.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.080
Oh boy.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.080
All right.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
All right.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.080
I'll have to check that out.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
And then of course the 10 year anniversary show is July 16th.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.080
Right?

38:44.080 --> 38:45.080
Yes.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.080
All right.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
Did you kidnap a child?

38:48.080 --> 38:49.080
Okay.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.080
All right.

38:50.080 --> 38:56.840
Anyhow, let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.380
Loki.

38:58.380 --> 39:05.160
So Monday, this is coming up Monday, there's going to be some stuff going down in California.

39:05.160 --> 39:10.840
The case Brown versus EMA, which is formerly Schwarzenegger versus EMA, involving California's

39:10.840 --> 39:18.720
attempt to enforce a law written by, thank you, Leland Yee, a Democrat representing San

39:18.720 --> 39:24.380
Francisco in 2005, that would criminalize the sale of hyper violent games to kids.

39:24.380 --> 39:29.000
It's not necessarily all M rated games, but only certain types of games as defined by

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
the law.

39:30.000 --> 39:38.800
These new games would need to be labeled specially and carry a thousand dollar fine to those

39:38.800 --> 39:43.100
who are found violation of the law, selling those games to minors.

39:43.100 --> 39:47.720
And it says, if the court rules for California, it will be overturning a half decades worth

39:47.720 --> 39:52.480
of decisions in lower courts that said California's law violated first amendment protections of

39:52.480 --> 39:56.920
freedom of speech.

39:56.920 --> 40:03.000
Apparently also, it doesn't necessarily mean if the court decides that it's against the

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
first amendment.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.800
It says they could still direct the state in how to write the law that would criminalize

40:06.800 --> 40:12.560
the sale of games to kids without violating the constitution.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
I don't know.

40:13.560 --> 40:17.600
So basically, if they win, they're going to separate video games from music, movies, and

40:17.600 --> 40:23.280
books and all their forms of entertainment, singling them out, preventing them from going

40:23.280 --> 40:27.000
to be sold for minors and stuff like that.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Okay.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
What?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.560
Dark soccer is saying, is this more important than a Supreme court hearing on video games

40:32.560 --> 40:34.120
to change the way we buy games?

40:34.120 --> 40:35.120
Yes, it is.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.120
I'm dying to hear this.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
It's cake.

40:37.120 --> 40:42.400
Oh, birthday to you.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.640
Happy birthday dear Rob.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.640
Happy birthday to you.

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
Thank you guys.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
Yeah.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.640
It's my birthday too.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.640
Not just the shows.

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
I have to make a wish.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.640
Yes.

40:55.640 --> 40:56.640
Okay.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.440
I'm going to, Oh, do I get, do I have to say my wish or do I have to keep a secret?

40:59.440 --> 41:02.440
You can tell us after the show.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.920
One, two, way to blow Rob.

41:06.920 --> 41:07.920
He sure knows how to blow.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.920
He's gone from suck to blow.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
Yay.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.200
I blew them all out.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.200
Yay.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.200
Thank you for not setting the cake on fire.

41:15.200 --> 41:24.360
I appreciate that because there are not 30 candles on that cake, there's far less.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.120
I'll get plates while he finishes the story.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.120
That's told you.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.120
All right.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.360
And that's, that's not a Bel Air cake.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.480
That is a homemade cake.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.200
Becky's made the icing and everything from scratch.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.200
That's great.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.200
Yeah.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.200
Thank you so much.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.200
Thank you, Becky.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.200
All right.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.200
Isn't she sneaky?

41:40.200 --> 41:41.200
Anyhow.

41:41.200 --> 41:45.080
Um, so yeah, it's, it sucks and hopefully it doesn't pass cause I mean, seriously, I,

41:45.080 --> 41:48.880
there's enough reasons to hate the government in California.

41:48.880 --> 41:54.120
We don't need them to be, and Leland Yee, seriously, this guy has a hard on for like

41:54.120 --> 42:01.760
writing terrible laws that involve, you know, protecting the children.

42:01.760 --> 42:02.760
What douche.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.760
Chatters want a picture.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.760
Sorry.

42:05.760 --> 42:09.680
I was yelling that I was relaying for the chat room that they wanted a picture.

42:09.680 --> 42:14.120
You know, all, all that neutering, just all, all, all that, that, that happy just neutered

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
my rant.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
I know.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
Right.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.640
It's like, I wanted to say a lot of angry things, but how can I be mad?

42:19.640 --> 42:21.080
Someone baked me a cake.

42:21.080 --> 42:25.800
Um, but seriously, what, what the hell is this supposed to solve?

42:25.800 --> 42:30.400
Ignorant parents are still going to buy their kids and rated games and not worry about it.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.080
Drew, I kind of feel like this discussion is like Pat, I mean, I'm not invalidating

42:34.080 --> 42:36.920
your point, but it's like, it's kind of like, there's nothing we can do about this now.

42:36.920 --> 42:44.800
The reality is tomorrow is a huge day because, and what I'm reminded of is other news that

42:44.800 --> 42:48.240
came out, it was here this week or last week about cigarette label warnings are supposed

42:48.240 --> 42:54.680
to get even bigger and like more either like the Canadian warnings now or like in Canada,

42:54.680 --> 42:57.680
you buy the pack of smokes and it shows like the decayed lungs and all that stuff.

42:57.680 --> 43:01.120
And it's like, okay, we get the point, God, you know, it's, it's, it's the same point

43:01.120 --> 43:04.320
where both of them, what the hell is this going to change?

43:04.320 --> 43:07.400
It's not, people who smoke are still going to smoke.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.880
Parents who ignorantly buy, you know, buy all these, these video games for their kids

43:10.880 --> 43:14.920
are still going to, and stores are already enforcing this stuff anyways.

43:14.920 --> 43:20.120
I mean, all they're going to do is just add another, like a fine to this and it's just

43:20.120 --> 43:21.800
going to screw people out of that.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.880
And then also on top of that, the government's got to decide, okay, which ones are, you know,

43:25.880 --> 43:26.880
really obscene.

43:26.880 --> 43:31.360
And if these have seen games or whatever are marketed as such, then certain stores may

43:31.360 --> 43:36.800
not carry them, you know, to keep their family friendly appearance, period, end of story

43:36.800 --> 43:38.800
should be done the same as movies.

43:38.800 --> 43:41.080
Why can't it just mirror movies?

43:41.080 --> 43:43.640
Because that would make these are interactive, Rob.

43:43.640 --> 43:47.480
You have to understand people are playing the role of the killer instead of watching

43:47.480 --> 43:48.480
the killer brutally.

43:48.480 --> 43:55.280
You know, I have a hard time believing that the penis game is worse for kids than the

43:55.280 --> 43:56.280
human centipede.

43:56.280 --> 43:58.880
I'm sorry.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.720
Or any of the saw movies.

44:00.720 --> 44:05.800
They can't be consistent because that would actually make sense.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.960
And they lose their jobs if they actually make sense.

44:07.960 --> 44:11.240
It's all about trying to get a platform so he gets voted in or something like that.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.040
I don't even know what the point of this is.

44:14.040 --> 44:21.200
I it's, are they saying, are legal analysts trying to predict this one way or the other?

44:21.200 --> 44:23.920
Does anybody have a reading on how, which way this is going to go?

44:23.920 --> 44:28.360
They figured that the way that this is, this law's gone in other States, it's not going

44:28.360 --> 44:29.360
to pass.

44:29.360 --> 44:32.160
You know, and then here's the best thing apart.

44:32.160 --> 44:39.840
The best part about it is it's our tax money that the state is using to fight this thing.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.320
Thanks.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.320
I want a refund.

44:43.320 --> 44:46.640
Uh, go into our chatroom at chat.ownerswannabe.com.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.160
Rama in our chatroom says the stores do not enforce it.

44:49.160 --> 44:55.640
I've seen 16 year olds buy M rated games and the cashiers just hit the bypass keys.

44:55.640 --> 45:01.160
McMahon in chat says these new cigarette warning labels make me want to smoke.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.000
Well that's not having the intended effect then.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.600
I really am.

45:08.600 --> 45:15.640
I think I like how they handle it in, in England where movies and games have the same reading

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
system.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.640
I'm so with you.

45:17.640 --> 45:18.640
I'm so with you.

45:18.640 --> 45:22.360
Just give games the exact, I mean, I guess we're kind of past the point of no return

45:22.360 --> 45:23.440
so to speak.

45:23.440 --> 45:26.440
Like we've already had this rating system that's been established in place for years.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.760
It's not that difficult to understand the rating system though.

45:28.760 --> 45:33.520
I mean, how, how much more do we need to, I mean, it's, I don't think it's necessarily

45:33.520 --> 45:39.440
that, you know, these people, um, these people don't know what the rating system is or that

45:39.440 --> 45:40.440
these games are violent.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.220
I think they just don't care.

45:42.220 --> 45:46.160
It's just like, oh, I don't care if I get cancer from smoking or I don't care if I,

45:46.160 --> 45:48.720
you know, get liver damage from drinking.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.340
They just don't care.

45:50.340 --> 45:56.320
And no amount of laws and stickers and banners and, you know, campaigns and whatever are

45:56.320 --> 45:58.960
going to get these people to care anymore.

45:58.960 --> 46:03.360
Unless you say, oh, you bought this for your child, we're going to fine you a thousand

46:03.360 --> 46:04.360
dollars.

46:04.360 --> 46:08.880
Then, you know, the immortal words of Bill Murray, it just doesn't matter.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.560
Or, uh, how about Dennis Leary?

46:11.560 --> 46:12.560
It's a drug.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.760
We're addicted.

46:13.760 --> 46:18.080
Some not very encouraging words from Black Wolf in the chat room saying, Sky, the mock

46:18.080 --> 46:22.480
trials that some law school schools have done said that the Supreme Court will side with

46:22.480 --> 46:23.480
California.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.200
Well, then they're dumb.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.200
I'm sorry.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.200
Then that's sad.

46:27.200 --> 46:31.360
We're at a really sad state is if they single this out, then, then they need to fight this.

46:31.360 --> 46:35.020
They need to appeal it and they need to fight it because it's the Supreme Court, Loki.

46:35.020 --> 46:36.720
You can't appeal that it is.

46:36.720 --> 46:40.520
There is no, there is no court higher in the land than the Supreme Court period.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.520
I'm sorry though.

46:41.520 --> 46:46.840
But you're singling, basically you're restricting the freedom of expression because you're restricting

46:46.840 --> 46:51.920
the sale of these certain games, which have not even been proven to cause any harm to

46:51.920 --> 46:52.920
children anyways.

46:52.920 --> 46:56.120
The crime rate's actually decreased since the Super Nintendo came out.

46:56.120 --> 47:01.760
So there's, there's no, it's not like, you know, smoking or, that's a pretty easy distinction.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.840
You're talking about all hypothetical stuff.

47:03.840 --> 47:09.760
We don't, there's no, like playing a violent video game doesn't make me catch on fire or,

47:09.760 --> 47:11.920
you know, doesn't make my lungs deteriorate.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.080
It's just a game.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.880
Loki, welcome to America, home of unnecessary moral panic.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.000
It was like this for D&D.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.760
It was like that for Doom.

47:22.760 --> 47:23.760
It's going to continue.

47:23.760 --> 47:28.080
And how many of us who were raised on D&D are sacrificing chickens in the backyard?

47:28.080 --> 47:29.080
Don't check my backyard, Jamie.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.080
I swear to God.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.080
Here's my thing.

47:31.080 --> 47:35.360
If, if this comes down tomorrow and it doesn't go the way we think it should, you know, the,

47:35.360 --> 47:40.660
the only way you can quote unquote retaliate is with your vote and stop voting for people

47:40.660 --> 47:43.200
that are going to shove moral righteousness down our throat.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.680
Who is voting for Lee Lin Yi?

47:44.680 --> 47:46.360
San Francisco, I blame you.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.800
This is all your damn fault.

47:47.800 --> 47:48.800
You and his sister?

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
I thought he was SoCal.

47:49.800 --> 47:50.800
No, he's San Francisco.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.800
He's San Francisco.

47:51.800 --> 47:52.800
And guess what?

47:52.800 --> 47:56.960
You know, this is the same type of shit that they passed over there was they were banning

47:56.960 --> 48:01.760
toys from Happy Meals because that'll get people to stop buying fast food for their

48:01.760 --> 48:03.320
children.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.400
Yeah.

48:05.400 --> 48:07.800
No people not being stupid will do that.

48:07.800 --> 48:12.140
Well, San Francisco's also got the whole thing about, what is it, they want to ban circumcision

48:12.140 --> 48:13.140
or something like that.

48:13.140 --> 48:17.760
So yeah, listen, San Francisco, you're already fucking strange enough as it is, you know,

48:17.760 --> 48:22.920
you don't really, there are other things we need to legislate, but, but then you go, well,

48:22.920 --> 48:28.640
everybody that's going to, you do that, that's going to start coming into line with, um,

48:28.640 --> 48:34.280
uh, uh, with religious tolerance groups because the, um, the anti-defamation league has already

48:34.280 --> 48:35.280
gotten in on that.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.960
Well, and then here, but then here's the other thing on the other side of the coin.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.160
So you, you look at these things that San Francisco is doing, you kind of roll your

48:40.160 --> 48:45.500
eyes, but at the same time, everybody in San Francisco has healthcare and whether you're

48:45.500 --> 48:50.160
a fan of socialized healthcare or not, you have to admit that's quite a feat that they're

48:50.160 --> 48:51.160
doing it.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.460
I mean that it's happening there.

48:53.460 --> 48:57.840
Whether you're a fan of that theory or not, you got to say, wow, that is quite a political

48:57.840 --> 48:58.840
feat that they're doing.

48:58.840 --> 48:59.840
Yeah.

48:59.840 --> 49:00.840
Here's what they're doing.

49:00.840 --> 49:01.840
They're wasting money is what they're doing.

49:01.840 --> 49:05.600
They're wasting money by giving everybody healthcare, whether you deserve it or not.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.960
And they're also wasting money with all these fucking laws that you're trying to pass.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.440
No, we, we, they deserve help.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
All right.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
You know what?

49:12.440 --> 49:13.440
They're not fucking working.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
They don't deserve healthcare.

49:14.440 --> 49:16.120
You got to pitch in to get something back.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.120
You know what?

49:17.120 --> 49:20.720
What about if somebody, you know what, I will tell you this right now and you're about to

49:20.720 --> 49:23.080
get the verbal bitch slap for me.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.320
I got laid off of my job.

49:24.320 --> 49:25.320
I have been applying.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.320
Dan has been applying.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.240
Neither of us have insurance right now.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.120
And if he had another heart attack, what would we do?

49:30.120 --> 49:31.120
He would die.

49:31.120 --> 49:35.040
End of story because we can't afford, I understand that, but you were working at one time.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.960
So you have already contributed to society, there were a lot of people that are homeless

49:37.960 --> 49:41.480
on the street now because they lost their jobs.

49:41.480 --> 49:43.420
Their houses were foreclosed on and they have nowhere to live.

49:43.420 --> 49:48.360
We know a person personally in that circumstance.

49:48.360 --> 49:51.400
So yeah, I think before you, you know, say shit like that, please.

49:51.400 --> 49:52.400
I'm sorry.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.400
It's my opinion.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.400
Okay.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.400
I don't care.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.920
Some of these people that are homeless, they choose to be homeless.

49:56.920 --> 50:00.840
There has been tons of studies where people have tried to help these people out and sure

50:00.840 --> 50:03.640
enough, they give them money or whatever, and they're back on the street again because

50:03.640 --> 50:05.040
they can't fend for themselves.

50:05.040 --> 50:08.720
Nine years stands for to stent in the ranks right there.

50:08.720 --> 50:12.320
Well, it's like a married couple, but I could queue up the penis song again if that's what

50:12.320 --> 50:13.320
we need.

50:13.320 --> 50:17.000
Let's just work towards getting our money spent on more important things like putting

50:17.000 --> 50:19.760
shrimp on treadmills.

50:19.760 --> 50:22.800
All I'm saying is that they're passing a lot of these laws.

50:22.800 --> 50:23.800
It's just wasting.

50:23.800 --> 50:27.320
Why don't you like, I don't know, work on a state budget.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.320
How about that?

50:28.320 --> 50:30.080
You know, cause they don't have that taken care of yet.

50:30.080 --> 50:34.160
Yeah, but that's the city and not the state.

50:34.160 --> 50:39.720
Okay, so yeah, tomorrow, big day for gamers is going to be, going to be interesting.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.720
I like cake.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.560
This cake is delit.

50:42.560 --> 50:45.040
And it's not a lie.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.440
This is legitimate cake.

50:46.440 --> 50:51.480
And it's hilarious because I used to own those very same plates.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.480
I've lost control.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.480
All right.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
You had control?

50:54.480 --> 50:55.960
Yeah, I never did.

50:55.960 --> 51:00.120
Hey, let's talk about the PlayStation four.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
That's right.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.120
PlayStation four.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.120
I'm going to throw up now.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.680
No, here's the deal.

51:04.680 --> 51:09.760
It was asked this week of some of the Sony higher ups, specifically Jack Trenton, who

51:09.760 --> 51:14.200
of course, he's the guy that Sony has on stage for all the oppressors and all that stuff.

51:14.200 --> 51:16.500
They asked Jack Trenton, what do you think of the Wii U?

51:16.500 --> 51:21.440
Are you feeling the pressures to develop the PlayStation four because now Nintendo has

51:21.440 --> 51:27.160
announced the Wii U and Jack Trenton said to Forbes, I didn't see anything about Nintendo's

51:27.160 --> 51:30.880
announcement that said, oh, we'd better get working on rolling out a new PlayStation here

51:30.880 --> 51:32.280
pretty soon.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.680
What we've seen from the competition is trying to add features that already exist in the

51:35.680 --> 51:37.640
PlayStation three.

51:37.640 --> 51:41.320
We've invested heavily in that and we've rolled a very heavy rock up a steep hill through

51:41.320 --> 51:42.320
the launch period.

51:42.320 --> 51:46.040
But now I think that all pays off and we've got a long run way behind it.

51:46.040 --> 51:49.360
Very interesting that they call it a steep hill and kind of admitting that it was a rough

51:49.360 --> 51:50.360
launch for them.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.360
He has a point.

51:51.360 --> 51:56.840
And the point is also, if you think about it, Nintendo has never developed HD games.

51:56.840 --> 52:01.220
I mean, they're way behind everybody else as far as putting out games that are high

52:01.220 --> 52:02.360
definition.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.360
I don't know.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.360
It sells consoles.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.600
I guess they haven't had to so far.

52:05.600 --> 52:08.640
Yeah, but you see, they'll get you only so far.

52:08.640 --> 52:13.320
Then they realize, oh, hey, people that are hardcore gamers, the ones actually purchasing

52:13.320 --> 52:16.960
games other than, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.

52:16.960 --> 52:21.500
Yeah, let's let's assume they have enough money to buy an HDTV, first of all, and then

52:21.500 --> 52:23.360
let's develop HD games.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.760
You're right, because no one has HDTVs nowadays.

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
Oh, my God.

52:26.760 --> 52:31.840
I'm just, where am I going to find people that own HDTVs out there?

52:31.840 --> 52:32.840
Ugh!

52:32.840 --> 52:37.360
Everywhere is where I'm going to find them because they sell them everywhere and people

52:37.360 --> 52:40.680
have already adopted to that and they've already adopted to new HD formats.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.960
I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.

52:43.960 --> 52:48.520
I'm still busy watching UHF and sending out newsletters on a mimeograph, sorry.

52:48.520 --> 52:50.600
I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.

52:50.600 --> 52:54.440
Well, I think also you have to look at this now.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.940
You know, we're at this point where, yeah, there's some people that still have their

52:56.940 --> 53:01.200
standard definition TVs because they haven't had an upgrade, but inevitably those TVs will

53:01.200 --> 53:02.200
fail.

53:02.200 --> 53:03.200
All TVs will fail.

53:03.200 --> 53:08.280
And there's, you can't buy a standard definition TV anymore unless it's at a garage sale or

53:08.280 --> 53:09.280
something.

53:09.280 --> 53:12.840
I mean, if you go into a Target or a Walmart, you all only have HDTVs to choose from now.

53:12.840 --> 53:14.040
And you know what's funny?

53:14.040 --> 53:17.280
I've got video game systems now that will not play on any modern television.

53:17.280 --> 53:19.920
Oh, yeah, not without some serious shopping at Radio Shack.

53:19.920 --> 53:23.040
I need to actually have a UHF capable TV.

53:23.040 --> 53:31.840
All right, so yeah, in a nutshell, he's basically saying, well, I don't see the need to hurry

53:31.840 --> 53:34.800
up and develop the PlayStation 4, because it looks to me like Nintendo's just trying

53:34.800 --> 53:36.760
to get up to the level of the PlayStation 3.

53:36.760 --> 53:37.760
Bitch slap.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.760
Well, and also...

53:38.760 --> 53:42.680
Funny for the ones that were a little late to the party with Move and Shut, shit like

53:42.680 --> 53:43.680
that.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.680
Yeah.

53:44.680 --> 53:48.200
And also, to their point, I mean, they're on the 10-year life cycle or whatever, so

53:48.200 --> 53:50.320
they're not going to kind of deviate from that.

53:50.320 --> 53:53.320
And I don't think you're going to see the same thing happening with Microsoft either,

53:53.320 --> 53:57.680
because they're confident that the Kinect is going to drive the console for the next

53:57.680 --> 53:59.640
five years or whatever.

53:59.640 --> 54:06.200
And Nintendo really, sales are dipping, and no one really gives a crap about...

54:06.200 --> 54:09.640
There's going to be the people that will buy every fucking Mario game that comes out, Mario

54:09.640 --> 54:14.600
Kart game and Animal Crossing game, even if it's just slightly different than the last

54:14.600 --> 54:18.680
one, because they're suckers for that kind of stuff.

54:18.680 --> 54:23.920
Now at the same time, though, they need to get with it, because a standard definition

54:23.920 --> 54:29.440
console isn't going to cut it when, say, the next console generation rolls around, and

54:29.440 --> 54:34.400
they're going to be playing some catch up when the next generation comes around, even

54:34.400 --> 54:40.100
though it is going to be able to push a little bit better graphics than the 360 is, but they

54:40.100 --> 54:41.440
have to know how to use it.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.560
Now the third party developers probably won't have a problem with that, because they're

54:43.560 --> 54:50.820
used to developing HD games, but Nintendo themselves, I think you're going to see them

54:50.820 --> 54:54.480
struggling trying to figure out how to utilize this console, and I think they're going to

54:54.480 --> 55:00.040
go more the gimmicky route, where cartoon graphics and shit with the touch screen.

55:00.040 --> 55:04.200
Yeah, they tend to be a little more agile as far as console concepts, but the technology

55:04.200 --> 55:06.080
just lags a little bit behind.

55:06.080 --> 55:09.200
Not that it doesn't sell, but it sells to a different crowd.

55:09.200 --> 55:13.080
Well one other Sony tidbit for you guys before I get to a story from Dark Sakura, but you

55:13.080 --> 55:16.200
know, of course, one of the big selling points, speaking of touch screens, on the Vita is

55:16.200 --> 55:21.480
not just the touch screen, but the rear touch panel, the reach around panel, if you will.

55:21.480 --> 55:27.620
In an interview with Famitsu Magazine, Suhei Yoshida, who's the president of World Wide

55:27.620 --> 55:34.940
Studios for Sony, said that the reach around panel almost was not on the final design because

55:34.940 --> 55:36.680
of cost.

55:36.680 --> 55:41.640
Sony was not sure that it would really impact the gameplay, and maybe it's not worthy of

55:41.640 --> 55:43.200
the sticker price.

55:43.200 --> 55:48.880
They say once people actually got their hands on it, that it became a must-have feature.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.920
Some small elements of the Vita's design are still subject to change, so we'll see what

55:52.920 --> 55:54.680
happens.

55:54.680 --> 55:56.760
But the reach around panel will still be there.

55:56.760 --> 55:59.800
I imagine when they say other things are subject to change, they're talking about what, like

55:59.800 --> 56:05.440
button positioning, or maybe the memory inside, or whatever, some of the chips that make the

56:05.440 --> 56:07.480
thing work, that all can still change.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.720
So we'll see what happens.

56:08.720 --> 56:12.320
It's probably not going to change very much, seeing as it's only a few months away.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.400
Yeah, maybe slight configuration things, but I can't...

56:15.400 --> 56:16.600
It will come in white.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
Yeah, exactly.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.440
It will come in different colors.

56:20.440 --> 56:21.440
So we'll see.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.580
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

56:23.580 --> 56:30.880
We have some other news that is, well, it's Wii-related, Wii.

56:30.880 --> 56:34.180
How bad do you want Xenoblade for Wii?

56:34.180 --> 56:35.960
How many people want it?

56:35.960 --> 56:41.360
Well, apart from that, there's also the last story, Pandora's Tower.

56:41.360 --> 56:47.520
Those are the set right there that actually people are asking to have released outside

56:47.520 --> 56:49.240
of Japan and Europe.

56:49.240 --> 56:52.640
So we're hoping that Nintendo can bring it to the US.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.960
Let me guess, there's online petitions and things of that sort?

56:57.960 --> 57:00.160
There's letter writing.

57:00.160 --> 57:07.920
They're actually, basically, there's a bunch of stuff that's gone out from the IGN forums

57:07.920 --> 57:10.400
asking Nintendo to put out the games.

57:10.400 --> 57:15.120
So they're actually looking for physical letters to be sent in to Nintendo.

57:15.120 --> 57:17.280
Because that works so well for Mother 3.

57:17.280 --> 57:18.280
Yeah, exactly.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.280
I was just thinking the same thing.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.760
It's just earthbound all over again.

57:20.760 --> 57:25.320
You know, it is a little strange that they didn't, you know, with especially as big of

57:25.320 --> 57:29.360
a game as the last story, it just jumps out at me out of those three with what an epic,

57:29.360 --> 57:34.360
epic game it was supposed to be, or is, I guess you could say, in Japan.

57:34.360 --> 57:37.560
It's really surprising to me they didn't come out and say anything about it at E3, that

57:37.560 --> 57:39.640
this game was on its way.

57:39.640 --> 57:43.280
Is it maybe something they're keeping in their hat for if Wii U gets delayed?

57:43.280 --> 57:44.760
Well, there's more though.

57:44.760 --> 57:48.480
Xenoblade was at E3 under a different name.

57:48.480 --> 57:55.040
And they actually flat out asked Reggie about the titles and he just went, oh, look, Pony.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.360
I'm sorry, that's not a Mario game.

57:56.360 --> 57:59.220
I don't know what you're talking about.

57:59.220 --> 58:02.640
Take it from a Tales of fan, this shit never works.

58:02.640 --> 58:04.920
This petitioning never, ever works.

58:04.920 --> 58:09.620
Well, it might work if you can get a million people to sign it.

58:09.620 --> 58:10.620
Not even.

58:10.620 --> 58:14.660
If they want to screw a particular audience, they will.

58:14.660 --> 58:15.840
You know what I think?

58:15.840 --> 58:20.680
And this is what I think for a lot of the big import titles, or, you know, the big Japan-only

58:20.680 --> 58:23.120
releases that we want to see in America.

58:23.120 --> 58:30.800
Do it like they handled the remastered Macross DVDs, where you have a price set for if we

58:30.800 --> 58:33.840
have this many pre-orders, the game will be this price.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.140
And we'll do it.

58:35.140 --> 58:39.000
This is what it's going to cost plus standard profit margin.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.840
And then we get more pre-orders to this level, the price goes down.

58:43.840 --> 58:45.840
We get more orders to this level, the price goes down.

58:45.840 --> 58:47.640
So kind of a kickstart thing.

58:47.640 --> 58:51.820
Since we're reminiscing about the past a lot tonight, it reminds me of what Konami did

58:51.820 --> 58:56.120
for BeatMania 2DX7 style when that finally came out on home consoles, is that they basically

58:56.120 --> 59:00.420
said if we can get 10,000 people to pre-order the game, we'll make it.

59:00.420 --> 59:03.960
And it just, it amazes me to this day that they got away with something like that.

59:03.960 --> 59:08.480
Because you're like, you're putting down a full pre-order on a game, you don't even know

59:08.480 --> 59:10.640
it's going to happen or not.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.640
So it's kind of weird.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.320
But if they say they're not going to do it, then they have to refund the money.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.320
Yeah, I know that.

59:14.320 --> 59:18.560
But it's still weird that so many people are willing to kind of put down the money up front

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
on a maybe.

59:19.560 --> 59:20.560
You know what I mean?

59:20.560 --> 59:21.560
It's just crazy.

59:21.560 --> 59:22.560
And the fans will do stuff.

59:22.560 --> 59:27.920
Well that, I mean, but you notice I brought up the, uh, the, uh, Macross box set?

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
They did that.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.200
It actually worked.

59:30.200 --> 59:35.800
And the price went down for, like, a full series box set to something way low.

59:35.800 --> 59:39.540
Just throw it away.

59:39.540 --> 59:44.080
And you know, if they do this, I'm going to put this up, because...

59:44.080 --> 59:46.480
That's his middle finger, folks, because it's not a TV show.

59:46.480 --> 59:50.040
Uh, yeah, because, I'm sorry, it's, it's stupid.

59:50.040 --> 59:55.440
Why make all your fans of your system jump through hoops to get a game put out over here?

59:55.440 --> 59:58.420
You either do it because you want to put it out, or you don't do it.

59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.880
Don't make people beg for it.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.080
I mean...

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080
The bottom line.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080
Money.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.600
It's all back to money.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
It's a company.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600
They need to make a profit.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.560
And the Wii is not selling software right now.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.320
And remember, it's all about ease of getting these games out.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.800
It's a lot easier for them to take a GameCube game, pretty the graphics up a little bit,

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.760
and port it back out, and call it like a anniversary collection or some bullshit like that.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.080
And then charge, you know, 50 bucks, and then people will, you know, totally eat it up,

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.080
or...

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080
I didn't say Roger.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080
Thank you.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080
Roger.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080
Apparently now Rob is called Roger.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.240
It's all right, I'll take it.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.000
Thank you.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.440
Or they can, you know, spend the money.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.540
It's going to take to localize a game that's pretty awesome.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.240
They're not going to do that, because localizing a game is going to take a lot of time.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.600
You know, what I think the best bet would be is to get that game pitched to some companies,

01:00:51.600 --> 01:01:02.120
say for example like, you know, Tomo, or UFO Interactive, or Ignition, or you know, Axis

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120
Game Localization.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.560
You know, those companies that basically all they do now, in fact, I don't know if it's

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.680
one of the stories in the show role, but Ignition stopped making their own first party, or their

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.160
own games.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:18.040
They had a game that they developed, El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron, but now they're

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.960
just saying, listen, we're just going to take properties that are over in Japan, just bring

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.880
them over instead of making our own shit.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.680
So that's who you need to, you know, pitch that game to, is one of those companies.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.640
Sounds like they're going to be the next Working Designs.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.900
And they will basically do it for you.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.580
Of course, after they get done with President Cat, because they haven't started on President

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.840
Cat yet, and so we don't have that yet.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
That's right.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.040
You can't have the last story until we get President Cat.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.840
That's just the way it's going to be.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840
President Cat.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840
All right.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.840
Moving on.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.460
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:55.440
So free-to-play, it's something that I believe when Nintendo was asked about it, they said,

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:01.240
nope, we have no plans on putting anything free on our marketplace, you bastards.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.240
Well, at least as far as free-to-play MMOs or something like that.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:11.480
Well, Microsoft's actually kind of feeling out with developers to see if they can, you

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.880
know, get some free-to-play games.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.600
And I guess they're now contacting studios, discussing the possibility of free-to-play

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.960
games, and you know, building some sort of infrastructure for the 360 that incorporates

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.360
microtransactions.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.480
Because they were like, Free Realms is so awesome on the PlayStation 3, and we want

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.360
a game on Xbox where you can play as a fairy.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.560
I don't think that they're necessarily doing that, but I think that they see the profit

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.400
that like, say, like, you know, Farmville or the Smurfs Village stuff, you know, that

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:51.880
makes a lot of money, and people, some people are looking for that kind of thing, so maybe?

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.080
Would you be interested in free-to-play games on the Xbox, Loki?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080
No.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.080
No?

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.080
Why not?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080
Just because the quality is less, or?

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.720
It's usually not my, you know, the type of games that I want to play.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.840
If it was like a free-to-play grant that thought of MMO or something, that's a little different.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:14.600
I'd at least check it out, like, you know, heck, I even played Yaris for like, 10 seconds.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:21.560
So alright, let's move on with some more gaming news, and I'm gonna get to a story about PlayStation

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.600
hardware in Japan.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.480
I believe there's a new bundle that has come out there in Japan.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:34.600
It's a charcoal black console, decreased power consumption they're saying, a 320 gig hard

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600
drive with it.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.880
It's a model CECH 3000B, and it was announced by Sony in Japan over the weekend.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:48.080
It is going to be 34,980 yen, and there will also be a 160 gig version of the model that

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:55.400
will come with Tales of Zilia, that is coming for $470, so you get that game.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.400
Not coming in this new bundle, an HDMI cable.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400
That is true.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.400
No HDMI cable.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.200
And you know what else is coming in that bundle?

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.640
New game encryption.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.040
Oh, is that really why they're trying to get the hardware out there?

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.960
They're putting out new hardware that's gonna change the way the keys are stored.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.840
Although, gotta have some sort of backwards compatibility because, or, I remember, they're

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:24.640
moving the, instead of having the actual keys built in, or the authentication keys built

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.000
into the console itself, it's being built into the Blu-ray drive.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.300
Much like how the 360 works, whereas they have it, you know, all the authentication

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:43.240
stuff is through the Blu-ray drive, or their DVD drive, obviously Blu-ray, not on the Xbox

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240
360.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240
Alright.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.480
DarkStalker, what do you got for us before we get to release dates?

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.180
Well, we have some little buggies fixed with the 3DS.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:58.680
There were a couple problems the different consumers were saying that was going on, and

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.720
according to Mr. Reggie, he says they're fixed.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:08.720
He said that the eShop is fixing one of them, because, well, it didn't launch with the eShop.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.400
It didn't shop with, yeah.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:19.720
And the other thing is that they're basically, the biggest hang-up was that they didn't have

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.680
a big Nintendo franchise, so they said they're fixing that too.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.760
In other words, we had no launch games, basically, is that what I'm hearing out of that.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.200
Well, that's why I didn't buy one.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.560
Their strongest launch title was from Capcom.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.280
I think it was Dead or Alive.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.480
I get, unless you want to count Pilotwings.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.720
Dead or Alive was apparently very terrible.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.800
I've heard from a lot of people that Dead or Alive was really good.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.880
Technically it didn't launch with Dead or Alive, that came out, I mean Launch Window,

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880
or whatever you want to call it.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.360
That is some bullshit there, Launch Window.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.600
Technically, it launched with the web store, because it was within the launch window.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.320
Well, how about I pay you at the end of the launch window, how's that sound?

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320
That doesn't work, no?

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.760
I'm excited about the idea that Netflix might come to the 3DS, because I like the idea of

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.840
having kind of like the portable device to watch.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.840
Oh Rob.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.840
I mean, granted, I know there's the phone, but also not just the portable thing in the

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:17.360
bed with, I think, a larger screen on those things, but also the possibility of actual

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.720
3D movies.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.080
Even though a lot of 3D movies are kind of eh, it's kind of cool in a way.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.400
I don't think it's going to be able to do 3D right, since it's all in particular anyway.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.120
They'd have to code it for, they'd have to re-image them to be specific for the lenticular

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120
monitor.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.640
Yeah, because like the 3DS, 3D doesn't bother me at all, it's kind of cool.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.640
But it's not real 3D.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.760
The 3DS and the theater, I don't like.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.760
It's not real 3D.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.760
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.500
I don't think it would be that difficult for them to do that, I mean, they do that already

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.720
with, you know, Blu-ray 3D stuff, I mean, there's a bunch of different formats that,

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:50.120
you know, 3D TV support, so I don't see why that would be a problem.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.600
Hey, you gotta admit, if Tron's gonna end up on 3D Netflix, you gotta at least check

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600
that out.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.200
That's gonna be pretty awesome.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.920
You know, it's funny, right before Tron was coming out, they was like, let's go get 3D

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.920
TV, let's go get 3D TV, Tron's coming out, let's go get 3D TV.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.920
I'm like, no.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920
So.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:12.440
Alright, so we'll see if, I'm really curious to see how 3DS will sell this holiday.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.760
This is definitely gonna be a make or break time for 3DS.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.760
Well, I was just a little annoyed that they were talking about like franchises coming

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.760
out.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.480
Look at all the things we announced that are gonna be coming out, you know, like, you know,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.560
all these different franchises that aren't coming out until the fourth quarter.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.440
The 3DS is gonna get really awesome soon.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440
Soon.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.320
You know, like in a few months, when it's awesome.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.880
Right now you have a paperweight.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.080
Enjoy your blue brick.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:41.760
I gotta tell you though, I mean, based off of what's, you know, scheduled to come out

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.960
for the 3DS, it's not all that exciting.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.960
It's about as exciting as the DS is.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960
It really is not.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.800
It's really into Ocarina of Time, I mean, that's one of the stronger titles right now.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800
Yeah.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:00.280
But, I mean, even like new release stuff, there's really not anything, like, exclusive

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.280
for it.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.760
It's like, oh my god, I gotta have that.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.460
Alright, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:10.720
What can you get at a store near you for some other consoles in your house this week, starting

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720
in the US?

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.760
Well, today, and I know this was on everybody's radar, but Mystery Case files the Malgrave

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.540
Incident out for the Nintendo Wii, yes.

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.540
That's the same suit.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.920
You gotta give me my pre-order.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.960
That's the same franchise that was on the DS.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.000
Ooh, I'm so excited about that.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.120
Thank you, Nintendo.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.840
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition on the 360 in case you don't own a console version

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.040
of Super Street Fighter IV, you can buy that with the DLC already in there, otherwise you

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.800
can just download the DLC and that's on 360 and PS3.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.440
Another game series that really a lot of people don't care about, Dynasty Warriors Gundam

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440
3.

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.320
Yes, they've made three of them now and that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.760
Sniper Ghost Warrior finally making its way out on PS3.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.420
A re-release of Call of Duty Black Ops, now the limited edition with the first strike

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.680
download content bundled in there.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.560
Resident Evil The Mercenaries for the 3DS, I believe we have a story about that later.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.000
Boy, other fun stuff is coming out this week.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.480
Three Stories Curse of the Ancient Spirit, that's exciting.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:33.320
And finally, UFC Personal Trainer, the Ultimate Fitness System, that's right, it is a UFC

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:39.120
themed fitness game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:48.080
Alright, well going over to Japan and checking out the Japanese releases, coming out on the

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.280
Xbox 360 from Sega on June 30th is Power Smash 4, that's just basically Virtua Tennis.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.840
I got really excited for a minute because I thought it might be Power Stone, but no

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.400
it's Power Smash which is Virtua Tennis.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.440
The Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition comes out in Japan as well and Test Drive

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.520
Unlimited 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the Xbox 360.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.080
Going over to the PlayStation 3 in Japan, Initial D Extreme Stage gets a price reduction

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.800
as does Senjou no Valkyria which I believe is Valkyria Chronicles over there in Japan

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.800
gets its price reductions.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.160
Power Smash 4 or Virtua Tennis also on the PlayStation 3 this week, it's a big SEGA week.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.140
And the same games, Super Street Fighter IV and Test Drive Unlimited 2 all making their

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:38.260
way to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.560
Going over to some other consoles, how about the Sony PSP?

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.780
We have Initial D Street Stage getting a price reduction as well as some other releases.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.440
Two Heart 2 Dungeon Travelers comes out in regular and limited edition, again that's

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.400
for the PSP.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:11:01.400
This is a game, it's an RPG where I guess it's kind of like they're reliving their childhood

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.180
fantasies or something but then you have the chick in the maid outfit with her legs up

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.760
and you're like, I don't want to think about childhood fantasies and see those pictures

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760
so I don't know.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760
It's a very...

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.360
Kind of childhood fantasies, are they having pedo bear childhood fantasies?

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.420
That actually makes me think of an anime that I started watching.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.800
On the Wii, do I even want to know what anime?

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.760
Are you sure it was an anime?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:30.340
It's called something like My Little Sister Can't Be That Cute and basically this guy

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.840
finds out that his sister, who's totally cool and popular with all of her friends and everything,

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:42.880
is a closet otaku and her fandom is Little Sister Hentai.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.400
On the Wii, Biohazard and Biohazard Zero get a price reduction.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.760
The show itself isn't dirty but she's into it.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.160
Oh Japan, never change.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:58.160
You heard about the guy in Canada, right, who brought Mango over there and got arrested

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.040
because of their child pornography laws or something like that and it faces up to a year.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:10.120
It faces a minimum of a year in jail and apparently all manga is banned there.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.040
I guess it makes the video game laws here not seem so bad.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.160
Anyhow, of course, Biohazard is Resident Evil, Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero get price

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160
reductions.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:24.200
Also, finally, coming out on the Wii in Japan this week, Goldeneye 007, that's right.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.360
The game we got here over the holidays, you can now play in Japan.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:33.160
I'm assuming it's been localized and such for the region, hence the great delay.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.160
And then you can play the game and then remember how much better it was on the Nintendo 64.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:43.440
Lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Tales of the Abyss from Bandai Namco, which, is

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.760
this an official Tales game?

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760
Wait, what?

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.760
Yes it is.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760
Yes it is.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760
It happens to be my favorite Tales game.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.560
Well, guess what, it's on the 3DS this week in Japan.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.140
God damn it, Japan.

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.140
God damn it, Namco.

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.560
You can import it on your region free.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.560
Oh wait, no you can't.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.560
No way.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.560
That's right, they got rid of that on the 3DS and there's no bastards.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:09.680
See, that's what I was talking about, Namco always screwing over anything that's not Japanese.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.200
Alright moving on, how about UK releases Dark Sakura?

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200
She's chatting with Chaz.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.520
I'm telling Penis Man that he's not weird.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:22.600
Oh and by the way, the name of the anime is called Ore no Emoto ga Konan ni Koai wa Kani

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.600
ga Nai.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.040
That's tight.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040
It's actually really funny.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.280
So are you stroking Penis Man's ego in the chat?

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.800
On the 28th we have Call of Duty Black Ops, Annihilation Pack, or as my brain initially

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.680
saw it, Black Oops.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.080
And then on the 29th we have Backbreaker Vengeance, ooh, which sounds kind of dirty.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.160
And then Half Minute Heroes, Super Mega Neo Climax, which also sounds kind of dirty.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160
I know.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.080
I wouldn't want to meet the Half Minute Heroes.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.480
That series is actually kind of cool, that's the sick thing is that 30 second hero, whatever

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.260
they call it here, is actually kind of fun.

01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.260
It's a neat series.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:02.960
I just wouldn't want to meet the Half Minute Hero in his climax.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.680
Didn't they have that come out in Xbox Live Arcade?

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.680
I think I dated him.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680
Spooked.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:13.280
Did he post on DDR Freak 2?

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Shush you.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.000
Oh, God gets it.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Alright.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
No.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I only have one thing to say about that game.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I know that.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Spooked.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.040
Moving on, two more stories for you, and then the classic game of the week.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:36.880
So I know this isn't the 90s, and this isn't The Matrix, but apparently Ubisoft wants you

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:43.880
to beat Neo at Child of Eden, a game that's sort of like The Matrix, because you're, hmm,

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:51.040
I know Kung Fu, flying around, less Keanu Reeves, but no, the artist Neo, apparently

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:59.040
he has a high score on the Evolution level, and to, I guess, boost Ubisoft's donation

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:05.760
of the Japanese earthquake relief, you have to try to beat his score.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:13.300
100,000 is already pledged, but for every score on the level, it's normal connect leaderboard

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:19.800
exceeding Neo's 306,800 points between now and July 4th, Ubisoft will add an additional

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:25.400
dollar up to a maximum of 20,000 dollars.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.400
Why Neo?

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.860
I don't understand why that artist out of, you know, I just don't think of Neo when I

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.580
think of Child of Eden, you know?

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.080
Maybe he's a fan of the game.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.880
Maybe Samuel L. Jackson had something else going on, or Ice-T, you know, he was too busy

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.920
pimping Call of Duty.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.960
Let me just compare a little bit here, okay?

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.240
We have Neo, ready?

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240
Here's Neo.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:16:01.880
Okay, I don't think I've heard that song at the club before, right?

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:08.000
So there's Neo, and then here is Child of Eden.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:21.640
That's right, you're getting a headache, because those two don't go together.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.640
Completely different key.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.320
Whatever, I guess whatever brings awareness to the game.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.480
All right, this has been some pretty controversial news this week.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.280
Team Fortress 2 went free to play, if you haven't already heard, and yeah, it's interesting

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.720
because of course Steam has released a lot of free to play games, other people's games,

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.120
you know, including things like Spiral Knights and Champions Online and things that for the

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.160
most part were already free to play.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.080
But Valve has taken one of its most popular games and made it free to play, and of course

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.940
there's been lots of hooray, free shit, and then there's been lots of boo, this game I

01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:02.480
paid for five years ago is now free and that makes me angry, because, you know, games don't

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.520
ever go on sale or, you know, end up in a bargain bin.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.160
That's totally not how I wound up with most of my Steam collection anyway.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:15.360
There are so many butthurt people about this going free to play, there are apparently servers

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.900
that are auto-banning people that are detected on the free to play version, there are people

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.580
that are just like, our game is ruined because of free to play, and so forth, and to those

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:28.840
people I say, fuck off immediately, because you are what's wrong with gaming right now.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.000
Cry some more.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.580
That whole, like, elitist asshole attitude just isn't gonna get you anywhere.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.580
Like in life.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:36.580
Period.

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:41.960
It reminds me of when Steam had the free weekends of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2, and Black

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.440
Ops.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.480
There was nothing but disdain to lower level folk because they were, you know, trial noobs,

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.240
they were weekend warriors, they were too cheap to play, you know, buy the real thing.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.280
I'm like, dude, fuck you, I might actually buy it.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.600
If you guys weren't such dicks.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:04.160
Yeah, I mean, and the game is, the game is five years old, and to be fair, Valve, although

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.400
they, you know, have done so many updates over the past few years and so forth, this

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.160
has gotten people talking about the game more than anything in quite some time.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.280
It's just a refreshing break from complaining about hats.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.280
I guess so.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280
That could be true.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:23.000
But yeah, I mean, I for one, I downloaded the game some time ago, I paid for it, you

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.880
know, it came with the orange box, and I'm not mad that it went free to play because

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.480
I realized I bought it several years ago and I could have been playing it then this entire

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.480
time.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.320
And then, because I got old, why did it get old to me?

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.840
I had nobody to play with, because I don't want to play with elitist assholes.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.760
Well gee, I'm sorry, Rob, you should have poked me some time.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760
But...

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760
Uh...

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.760
Not in that way, not that way.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.320
You must buy me a drink first.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320
Whoo!

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.320
But, but, I mean, for real though, like, this news, if anything, makes me maybe want to

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.400
go back and play Team Fortress 2 because I know there'll be other people to play with,

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.280
who will be as terrible as me, or at least not be jerks about it if they are pretty good.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.080
You know what I mean?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.040
Otherwise I hadn't really given this game a second thought, and yet I don't feel like

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.520
I wasted my money.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.680
The orange box was one of the best deals ever in gaming.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.680
Ever!

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.680
One of the best deals.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.480
Oh yeah, but where were people complaining when, uh, when Portal became free for a limited

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.480
time?

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.480
Hmm?

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.160
Oh wait, that's not multiplayer.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.320
We're not an unpleasable fanbase when it comes to that, are we?

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.160
Melted General in our chat says Team Fortress 2 is on its 218th update.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.160
Uh, that's...

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.160
It is a lot of updates.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.760
Now Rob, did it do that free, did it, did it, like, have you start downloading the Team

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.720
Fortress 2 beta?

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.480
I don't know, because I bought the game years ago, so...

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.000
Well I mean, I bought mine a long time ago, and it's, it, suddenly I looked on there and

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.960
it says downloading Team Fortress 2 beta.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.420
Which is weird.

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:48.040
It might be a free beta or something, who knows.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.940
Uh, the Rob D. in our chatroom at chat.org.com says I'm pissed in the way anyone is when

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:55.000
something goes on sale after they bought it.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.080
I don't feel like Valve should refund me or anything, such is life.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080
That's kind of how I feel too.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080
You gotta be pissed at yourself.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.440
I bought Left 4 Dead 2 when it was 20 bucks.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.440
The day after it became 7.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.280
Yeah, I bought Torchlight for what, like 10, and then like, I think literally a day later

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.280
it was 5.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.720
Oh well, shit happens.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.720
Exactly.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.160
You know, where it's like, you go buy a video game and then you find out, oh, if I bought

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.740
it on, you know, or bought it at Best Buy, I would have got a $10 card with it, you know.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.400
These deals, this is just how it works.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:28.080
You have to shop around for the best deals, and if you don't, oh well on you, you know.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.800
There's more money in that damn game.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.960
I would have been pissed if I'd bought Team Fortress 2 like two weeks ago, but I would

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.720
have been pissed in the way that somebody who buys Apple products gets pissed every

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.720
year.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.960
Oh, people who, uh, get used to one Adobe suite only to find out that CS6 is coming

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:51.480
out in a few months, fuck you Adobe.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.880
Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Team Fortress 2 going free, great, and I also bought

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.680
the orange box, surprised you didn't go free sooner.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:04.120
I just, I haven't heard a lot of like the FPS's or hell even like really the Valve-owned

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.800
games going free to play.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.600
Will Half-Life Episode 3 be free to play?

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.640
Well for what it's worth, as long as you paid some sort of money in Team Fortress 2, you

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.640
get perks.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.160
They're not leaving us out in the lurch completely.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:24.480
All of this, and Dungeon Buster, it said TF2 going free, great, I also bought the orange

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.480
box.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480
I bought the orange box.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.480
I have it on Xbox.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.480
Guess what?

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:34.160
I like playing better on my PC, so all this stuff going free, woo.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.520
Also in our chat room, Penis Man asks, so are we gonna form an all-games Team Suck?

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.140
Sure, works for me.

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.440
If that name isn't already taken, which it probably is.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.240
I'll roll up the group name when I get home.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.240
Alright, there you go.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.240
Team Suck.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.240
I could do it.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.840
Actually there is, well there isn't, to be real, there is an OLR team already out there.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.440
It's something Deep Man put together a long time ago, so I mean, there is already an OLR

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.520
team, and you know, I'm not saying this in a negative way, but they suck.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.520
I know we do.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:06.000
Or at least they will when I start playing on it.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.720
We don't need your help to suck, Rob.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.480
Black Wolf wants to clarify, yeah, except Apple will refund you within a certain time

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.480
frame.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.920
You know, if I had bought Team Fortress 2 two weeks ago, which I don't know who did,

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:22.680
but I wonder if you were to call Valve and complain if maybe they would give a refund.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680
Who knows?

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.640
Alright, there you go, let's get to the part of the show where we take a trip down memory

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.640
lane.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.640
We trip and fall.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640
Put some bricks.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.200
It's the classic game of the week.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.640
Dark Sakura is going to take a stroll down classic gaming's path and find the most obscure

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.640
fucking game she can to be the game of the week, which I believe is the case this week,

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640
correct?

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640
Yes, actually.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.640
I will say something.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.840
This is a game that I have talked about before.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.040
So it's, it's not really a surprise, it's probably a surprise to people that haven't

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.040
brought it up already.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.360
So the game of the week is called Emerald Dragon.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.720
And importers, PC Engine fans, you will know this one.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.880
Lots of dialogue, by the way.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:15.880
The game is an RPG done by Glodia, which they did, they're actually created by Telnet employees,

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:20.800
including Tenpei Sato, who was behind Disgaea.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.280
So this game could be, in theory, a precursor to Disgaea.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.720
Does it have prenees?

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.280
I only played through like the first very part of it, Rob, I was like, I can't read

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.280
that much Japanese.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.280
It's a valid question.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:46.040
Anyway, it came out for PC-88 in 1989, and then came to PC-98, X68000, MSX2, FM Towne's

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:51.520
computer, and then the console versions were the PC Engine, CD, and Super Famicom, but

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.480
they weren't done by Glodia.

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:58.000
So there's no versions that are outside of Japan, but you can get a fan's translation

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.120
for the Super Famicom version by Translation Corporation.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.580
So look for it if you really want to play it.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.040
So basically, it's a big RPG.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:11.160
There was a war in the past, and then lots of battle, and then there were two races that

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.320
lived on the main continent, and the Emerald Dragon was our champion, and then the Emerald

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.000
Dragon died and a curse fell over the land, blah, blah, blah.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.920
So now the last dragons are around, and you have to pretty much help them out.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:30.360
You actually find a green-haired girl whose name is Tamarin, which means purity, in the

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.880
ancient dragon language.

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.440
We'll call her Virgin.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.440
Virgin.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:43.120
But anyway, she has amnesia, so I won't spoil the game for you.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.440
There's also Barsem, Farnah, Hathrum, Khorsra, lots of different people, but basically it's

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:53.320
a traditional JRPG, but it has some pretty different combat.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:01.840
It has a large world to look over, but it's one big, unified piece, except in the Super

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.840
Famicom version.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.640
Dude, the combat in this looks like Ultima.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.640
Yeah.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:13.560
It reminds me of Treasure Hunter G, another gem that never made it to the States.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.480
The combat looks dead-on like Treasure Hunter G.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.320
Well, if they came out around the same time, then that could, you know, or by a similar

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.320
team.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.600
One was made by Square, and the other, yeah.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:33.360
Well, at any rate, the way that it works is that your timing for your attack is based

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.280
on your equipment.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.360
And then, but the only character that you can control is the main character, Attrucian.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.160
The other characters are done by the AI, but the AI is actually pretty smart.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.680
At any rate, with the Super Famicom version of this game, it has a dragon transformation

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.280
system so Attrucian can take on a dragon form.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.280
And it's pretty cool.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.240
I have the PC Engine version, I have a copy of the PC Engine version of this, I should

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:06.720
say, because the game costs in excess of $300 on eBay, on PC Engine.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.720
Yikes.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.800
One of my friends has this game, which is how I got my copy.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:19.280
She's also the same one who hooked us up with Dracula X when she owed us $100, so.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:27.480
And, but I mean basically, it's standard PC Engine fare as far as the screens, you know,

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:33.600
you've got the 16-bit sprites, and then you've got lots of voice acting, because hey, we're

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.060
doing these games on a CD now, not on HuCards.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.480
And all the audio in it is Redbook audio.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.120
So you can actually just pop a CD in your car, as long as you skip track two.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.120
Nice.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:52.360
So, but that is one of, I think, the gems in any PC Engine collector's archive.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:59.600
Like, if I had to have three games in my PC Engine, actually no I don't have a copy of

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.040
this one, I have Sapphire, no I don't have Sapphire, so if I had to have three games

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:10.040
that were in my, the top tier PC Engine, it would be Dracula X, which I've got, it would

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.160
be Emerald Dragon and Sapphire, which I've covered Sapphire before.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.880
So those would be the three.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.640
So you've got your action game, you have your RPG, and you have your shooter.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.640
So this is Emerald Dragon.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640
Alright.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.080
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.240
Very obscure, very hard to find, but very intricate for its time with the voice acting

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.240
and everything.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240
Emerald Dragon.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.940
It actually makes it more playable too, because then I at least have somewhat of a clue of

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.760
what's going on in the game.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.980
But yeah, if I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon, and like, oh look it's Sparna.

01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:48.160
If I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and not pay like, you know, 300 bucks for

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.760
it, I would be pretty stoked.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.680
Alright, your classic game of the week, Emerald Dragon on the PC Engine.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.800
And that's going to bring us to the close of part A, but don't go anywhere guys, we're

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.960
going to come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, lots of news in part B tonight, some

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.120
music game based news believe it or not, we're going to kick it off with.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.720
Your Twitter topics, so get those in, twitter.com slash olr, any topics like news stories and

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.040
so forth, or if you just have a question you want to ask us, you know, it's the birthday

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.000
show and all, maybe there's something that's burning on your mind that you want to ask

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.360
us, or perhaps our guests, one of the two.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.720
Jessica Harper from Understation Live is of course here at the studio, or intern Drew,

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.800
maybe you have a question for them, you can send those to twitter.com slash olr.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.800
And we'll have more stories coming up for you guys, FUs of the Week, Skype calls, and

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:40.360
plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:47.040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we are live with episode number 417, I actually

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.640
had to look that up, 9 years of Orange Lounge Radio, it's June 26th, 2011 when we're taping

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.720
of course the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, June the 23rd, because Sundays

01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.560
were on different days back then, of 2002.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.960
We're joined in studio tonight not only by of course my co-host Dark Soccer and Loki,

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:09.400
always here with us, but by some special guests, intern Drew is in the kitchen, but here in

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.740
studio with us the lovely Jessica Harper from Understation Live, that's getting birthday

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:19.840
spankings later this month for its 10th anniversary show, I mean next month, because we're late

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:26.340
June, so next month I guess, within a month, basically two weeks from now-ish, exactly.

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:30.720
And we've been spending a lot of the time earlier in the show kind of reminiscing about

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:35.240
the good old days of OLR, back when we were playing a lot of DDR and so forth, and for

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:40.040
those that haven't heard the story, Jessica and I actually played DDR for the first time

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040
together.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.800
I didn't see DDR the first time with Jessica, but I'm convinced I walked into the first

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.680
Milpitas Golf Land tournament and didn't know what I was walking into.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:55.560
But later we were at the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Convention, in Las Vegas, at

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:02.280
the Circus Circus, and the machine was calling our name, and it was saying, I-I-I, you know

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:07.960
you wanna play my ass, exactly, and we actually skipped, what was it, Shock Treatment or something

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.800
on Friday, which is a shitty movie anyway, yeah, basically we were bored to tears, we

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.320
just wanted to relax and go have some, you know, casino time, and we were having our

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.760
own convention, yeah, we were like, okay, let's go get drunk at, across the way over

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.840
at Quark's Bar, and exactly, since we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Rocky Horror

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.520
community anyway, why don't we just go play DDR, exactly, we had fun, it was a good time.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.720
But um, also that weekend, and I bring this up because this is kind of topical as of recently,

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:40.960
but uh, we went to the Adventure Dome, which is uh, is it even there anymore, it's at Circus

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.360
Circus, it's like a theme park, indoors at Circus Circus in Vegas, I don't even know

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.040
if it's there anymore, like, including uh, it had a full roller coaster and everything,

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:51.640
yeah, it was actually a pretty badass little place, yeah, I think, I don't think it's there

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.080
anywhere, because now New York has their roller coaster. I know we have some Vegas people,

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.400
so I'm sure somebody will chime in in a minute in our chat room and let us know, but um,

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.440
you know, we were at the Adventure Dome, and one of the things that they had there, and

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.080
we spent a little money on, about 20 bucks on, and it was a memory that would haunt me

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:11.560
forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and it was, and you have to keep in

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:16.740
mind that this was 11 years ago, yes, this is even older than, yeah, Understation Live

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:19.580
or, uh, Orange

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:51.720
K.C.D. has still lodged in my throat from eating, but she can belt it out, and like,

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.160
I'm kinda like, oh, I know Love Shack, but of course I had to do the guy part, and I'm

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.720
like, I kinda don't remember how the guy part goes, so I remember at one point, and I got

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:05.480
teased over this for like seven years, I would go, Funky Little Shack, Funky Little Shack,

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.920
like I'm like trying to read the words as they highlight, which, you know, in the song

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:15.080
is Funky Little Shack, yeah, I got the song later, but unfortunately, yeah, and that actually

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:20.480
became our karaoke song, when Rob and I used to go out to karaoke on a fairly regular basis,

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.120
that was one of our songs that we did together, you know, other than, what was the other one,

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:32.240
Human League, Don't You Want Me Baby, so yeah, we actually did kind of eventually incorporated

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.360
into our repertoire.

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:38.980
So but it's interesting, because whereas that kinda went to go make an ass out of me, it

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:43.840
actually showed off that you can sing girl, and I know you've seen that, I know one of

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:48.400
your other Cornerstone songs is What's Goin' On by Four Non-Blondes, or What's Up by Four

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.480
Non-Blondes, and Pat Benatar song you always used to sing too, right?

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.480
Hit Me With Your Best Shot.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.480
That's right, Hit Me With Your Best Shot.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.480
Whip Me With Your Big Cock.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.480
Sometimes, depending on how drunk she was, she might get up on stage.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:01.920
I remember, you know, it was a gay bar, I remember a certain occasion though at Great

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:06.360
America with someone recording Stay, yeah, that too.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:14.160
And then me doing Like A Prayer, which I foolishly let Travis even touch that CD.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.160
Anyhow.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.800
You should never ever ever let Travis have access to anything that you think might, yeah.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:25.200
I seem to remember also a certain Karaoke Revolution incident with the two of you.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.800
And that was when I discovered that this could really belt it out, I was stunned.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.240
But you are, you're still doing the vocal thing, right?

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.680
I know we said for years, like Jess, you should go try out for American Idol, you should go

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680
try out for American Idol.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.920
Well, now you can't try out for American Idol because you're too old, as we all are.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.440
But there's this new show where age doesn't matter, The Voice, right?

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.800
And have you been watching the show, you're really into it?

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.760
I am very, very much into it.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:53.280
I heard about it after the first episode, caught up with it online and fell in love

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.520
with it instantly because the entire concept of The Voice is that you are just a voice.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:03.440
You have, there's no physical you attached to it, it's just a voice in the air.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.800
The judges, their chairs are turned completely around, so they can't even see what the hell

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800
you look like.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:13.200
You're just singing to them, and they hit their button and turn around to accept you,

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.800
no matter what you look like.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.640
And by the way, yes, this does relate to video games, because this show is so huge.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.040
There will be a video game based on it in six months, I guarantee it.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040
Oh, I'm sure.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040
I guarantee it.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.040
So, um, so, so then now we have a new question.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.960
When are you going to try out for The Voice?

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.280
August 24th in San Francisco.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.480
Wow.

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.680
So you're doing it.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.960
I'm actually doing it, yeah.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.960
Oh my God.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.680
There's a full campaign going right now.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:44.600
I have a Facebook page, which goes by my, here you go, big moment on your ninth anniversary

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.600
show.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.320
I'm going to reveal my real last name because-

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:50.280
Oh, even I'm not going to do that.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.280
Because unfortunately there's no other way for me, and I couldn't just put myself as

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.880
Jessica Harper because I think Jessica Harper would get pretty pissed off.

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:04.280
So um, Jessica Friesen, um, if you go to facebook.com slash Jess Sings, um-

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280
How many S's is that?

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280
J-E-S-S-

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.280
Three.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.280
Okay.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.280
S-I-N-G-S.

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280
Okay.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.280
Four.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280
Well, yeah, if you can't throw it at the end.

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.280
Um, you can-

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.280
Rob, the master of the English language.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280
I know.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.200
While she's auditioning for The Voice, I will be auditioning for Wheel of Fortune.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.760
Rob is not the cunning linguist.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.240
So you can go ahead and check out my stuff.

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.640
I actually have, uh, things on there.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:33.720
Also on ReverbNation, um, dot com slash Jessica Friesen, um, that has not only the version

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:38.760
of Stay that Jamie had mentioned earlier, as well as the video of Rob and I doing that

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.320
infamous love shack.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:46.080
Now keep in mind, again, the video, it was from VHS and it is 11 years old.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.560
The years have not been-

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.560
Before we had DVD.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.480
Yeah, the years have not been nice to the recording, but you still get the hint.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:57.480
Um, and then there's also two recordings in there that are from when I was briefly with

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480
the band as well.

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:03.800
So, um, vocals, lyrics that were written by me and obviously sung by me.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.160
So yeah, please check it out.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.160
Fan me and stuff.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.160
Cause-

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.800
Yeah, let's, let's, um, let's, uh, Dark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind, would you post the link

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.480
in chat and, uh, chatters, if you wouldn't mind, let's help Jess out with some likes

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.120
and get her on The Voice because then when she wins, we can say it all started here.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.120
Yeah.

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:24.840
The Reverb Nation page, thereverbnation.com slash Jessica Friesen, um, that actually is

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.160
what I gave to the people at The Voice as my page.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.160
Nice.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.160
As my music page.

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.880
So I had to have examples of my music and the more likes that I can get on there, the

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880
better off I am.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.080
And I'm already up in the 50 ish people now.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.080
So if I can boost that up a little more.

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:40.080
A few more.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.080
Yeah.

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.080
All right, let's do it.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.080
Good luck to you.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.080
And let us know how that goes.

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.400
You know, and sometimes I don't even know what to expect on those auditions, but you

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.600
know, there's going to be thousands of people there.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.720
So if nothing else, go for the experience and have a blast.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.720
Yeah.

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.720
So that's my whole intention.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.600
I mean, I don't even expect anything to happen, but at least if I get out there and do it,

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.640
I can say that, you know, I tried, I at least gave it my best effort.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.600
Well, Tiger Claw in our chat room says, if Jessica makes it big on American Idol, I hope

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.280
she will remember all those who knew her on OLR.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:10.600
Well, I can guarantee you that won't be happening because she's trying out for The Voice.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.160
Wrong show.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.680
Anyhow, Salacious Pop has some karaoke requests for Jess and Rob.

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.680
Oh really?

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.480
So karaoke requests for Jessica and Rob.

01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.480
Let's see here.

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.080
Close to You by The Carpenters.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.000
No, I know what I want.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.760
Why Do Birds?

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.160
I actually used to do it.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.880
Part of my problem with Alone is that I am no longer the soprano that I used to be, but

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.640
you catch me with enough alcohol in my system, you might make that happen.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.020
Love Will to Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille.

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.200
And lastly, Don't Go Breakin' My Heart by Elton John and RuPaul.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.280
You know what, they need to show up because I have a Captain and Tennille song on my iTunes.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280
Thank you.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.280
I have Muskrat Love.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:54.440
But another, I could possibly get them to take it down a couple of notes, you know.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.760
If I can get that highest note, like just a little bit further down.

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:04.280
Did you, okay, did you happen to watch American Idol when Carly Smithson was on?

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280
Okay.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.200
We'll get back to video games at some point.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.280
She did Jesus Christ Superstar, but she's not, her voice isn't that high.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:19.160
So she actually harmonized, actually did a countermelody part and got away with it.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.160
So I love it.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.440
Our buddy Travis is in chat or DJ Morpheus is in chat.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.760
And in response to the whole Jessica saying, you know, we can say it's all started here

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:29.760
on OLR.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.520
DJ Morpheus says, no, she won't.

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.560
She'll be wearing a USL shirt when she's on TV.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.440
If she doesn't, she's fired.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.440
Touche.

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.080
And technically, you know, the entire thing did start over there because I did officially

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.080
announce it over there.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.080
I know.

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.080
Fair enough.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.080
Fair enough.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.080
But it would still be fun.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.080
I'll be all right.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.920
I embarrassed the shit out of myself with that bitch 11 years ago.

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:50.920
Exactly.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.440
You just went from 52 to 58 in the last five seconds.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440
Awesome.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.440
Thank you guys.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.440
So there you go.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.000
It may come in here worth it.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.040
No, appreciate having you here.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.640
And now we'll get that kind of response over on USL, you know.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.400
Hey, you guys should listen to us all right now.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.400
Oh, wait.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.720
There's podcasts to listen to that.

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.520
I know, go listen.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.160
Go start downloading right now.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.960
Late breaking news as we get into part B tonight.

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.580
We're going to get into some video game news, but Loki, you were mentioning some late breaking

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:26.160
news just before we went live tonight, and this has to do with music games.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.680
This is so big, I don't know how we didn't have it in the show before the news even came

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.680
out.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.320
Ubisoft has announced their next big music franchise.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.320
That's right.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:40.920
You've got to wonder, how the fuck are they going to follow up Michael Jackson?

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:48.360
I mean, Michael Jackson, the king of pop, one of the greatest pop icons in the world.

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.040
On the anniversary of his death, nonetheless.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.640
How possibly can we honor such...

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.000
How we go beyond that?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Who is actually...

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Who will carry the torch?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.520
Who will carry the torch?

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:07.480
And I am proud to announce the Black Eyed Peas will unfortunately carry the torch.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:15.520
Yeah, so Black Eyed Peas Experience, ah, I can't even say that.

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:24.080
That will be coming out to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii soon.

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.560
I see, so what would the Black Eyed Peas Experience consist of?

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.380
Just a bunch of shitty sampling?

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:38.560
I got a feeling that this game's gonna suck my ball sack at this...

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.560
I have to repeat this.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.560
What?

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.520
Tigerclaw said, and the only way to get Jessica back on OLR would be to have us contact her

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.520
agent.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.520
I know, right?

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:52.680
Then next year it'll be Jessica the Experience, but that would be better than the Black Eyed

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.620
Peas Experience, that's for sure.

01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.080
Is anyone excited about the Black Eyed Peas Experience?

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.080
No.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.880
I'm sorry, I completely was ignoring all of that.

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.880
I'm sorry they're jacking my style.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.640
Although I did see the best headline ever, can I share this with you guys?

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.880
Hold on, I put it on my Tumblr.

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.620
I don't talk about my Tumblr a lot because it makes me feel very hipster, but it's my

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620
favorite thing that I've posted on Tumblr.

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.240
Are you drinking PBR?

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240
In like a week.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.240
I think you're okay then.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:25.000
Here's the picture, it's a headline in a tabloid, it says, Fergie isn't pregnant, just really

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
likes tacos.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.080
Now that's an experience I can get done with.

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.720
I'm reposting that right now.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.880
That's what Tumblr's all about, I reposted it from Alan.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.600
Let me post that, can I post that, how do I post that in chat?

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.600
You just copy...

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.600
Copy link location.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.600
Yeah.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:45.600
There you go.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.600
There you go.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.600
Hooked on internet, worked for him.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.600
I think I might have put an extra slash at the end there, try that.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.600
Alright.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:42:02.200
So let's just pop in our chat room, it's just- What the hell did...

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:11.200
There will be no tumbling during the show, stop.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200
You post that in chat.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.080
I officially adore your boyfriend.

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:20.680
Is that an anteater face, I can't quite- It's like a little mermaid, it's a little

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.720
mermaid meets Cyrano.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.880
Oh no, no.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:31.160
Well speaking of salacious pop in our chat room, he's reacting to the Black Eyed Peas

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.040
Experience News saying, OMG, I'm like Regina George when she spit out the Cal teen bar

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.240
and screeched in Mean Girls.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:46.720
Anyhow, hey, we have spinoff shows, like I imagine you love Orange Lounge Radio so much

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.320
you want to listen to some other shows.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:52.360
I mean we've plugged the shit out of Undersedation Live certainly, but Dark Soccer and I do some

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.280
other shows too we want you to know about.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.280
Dark Soccer?

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.560
I do a podcast about comics where we don't really talk about comics that much anymore.

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.560
Because guess what?

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.640
The comic industry is lame right now.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:10.040
But it's me and Tiara as Mar and Marvel, I almost said Marvin.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.040
Marvin Morrill.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.080
I'm going to blow you up.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.480
My space modulator.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.480
I am Marvin the Marvel.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.600
No, I almost said Marvin Morrill.

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.320
And that just brings me straight to...

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.960
NERF 4!

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.160
Inside jokes for the win.

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.680
Marvin Marvel.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.800
And Dan Shadow.

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:43.280
And we, if you have anyone up on Tuesday, we are at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.560
and we want email eventually.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.200
People email us please.

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.320
Because I don't have to read them, Tiara has to read them.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.480
Make Tiara read your emails.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.280
And also we have Twitter.

01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:05.800
It's Comic Insanity, the letter N, not an I-N, on Twitter.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:11.780
If you like the World of Warcraft and you want to hear a show more obscene than this

01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:18.320
one, check out the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, Hoardhouse.com.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.920
This week's show we had our buddy Sil, who is originally from Amsterdam but she now lives

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.800
in Britain.

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.540
Not the London part, she lives in not London, we call it.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:35.500
And this week we got her to talk about ERP and an ERP story that will shock you.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.000
So yep, we're going to get into all that on Hoardhouse.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Hoardhouse.com.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
ERP.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It's awesome.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Also.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
What?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.520
There will be more stuff coming.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.800
More podcasts.

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.320
You and your crypto stuff-o.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.160
Well, you're in on it.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.680
You're helping out, shit.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.680
I disavow all knowledge.

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.560
Yeah, can we just skip the dwarven hand cannons please?

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.920
And DJ Morpheus always there to remind me in a who's your daddy kind of way.

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.480
Rob, Understation Live is not a spinoff, it's your father, bitch.

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.800
That's why we didn't plug it just then.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.800
Oh.

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.080
He just wants you to get off his lawn.

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.080
Alright.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.360
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.600
Waving his cane at you.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.640
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.880
Some stories that we want to get through quickly because we want to spend more time not talking

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.880
about video games.

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:26.480
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:27.480
Ah, yes.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.100
Since we were talking a little bit about music games before, I figured we might as well talk

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.060
about Rock Band.

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:42.120
At Rock Band, getting some new download content in the form of Poison Pack 1, featuring three

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:49.260
songs by Poison, including Nothing But a Good Time, Talk Dirty to Me, and Unskinny Bop.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:57.480
And that's going to be $2 each, or 160 Microsoft points, or $5.49 for the whole pack, or 440

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480
Microsoft points.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.040
Whereas my every rose has a thorn.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.440
Sorry, that's not...

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:07.120
And then also, of course, Three Doors Down, there's going to be a pack for them with the

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.440
songs Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and When You're Young.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:16.800
Each of those $2, and you know, $5.49 for the whole pack.

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.280
And then of course, if that's not exactly your taste, you may check out the Rock Band

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:27.160
Network, where there's been a pretty neat addition.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.880
They added Pac-Man Fever, among a bunch of other tracks.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:32.880
Pac-Man Fever.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:37.480
I was going to say, just a really quick side note, it's funny you mention every rose has

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.480
its thorn, Jamie.

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.800
That was my first slow dance ever.

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:43.420
Really, in 8th grade.

01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:44.640
But guess what?

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.440
It's not just Pac-Man Fever, because the Buckner and Garcias also have Mouse Trap, Hyperspace,

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.600
and Froggy's Lament on the Rock Band Network.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.600
Each of those two bucks.

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.640
But not doing the Donkey Kong.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:01.720
No, I'm sorry.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.840
And let's see here.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:09.120
Other than Rock Band, some stuff coming to LA Noire, or I should say LA Noire is coming

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.520
to PC's this fall.

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.560
They're going to be doing, you know, kind of the Rockstar thing, improving the graphics

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.760
a little bit and adding 3D support as well.

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:22.600
That'll be coming out this fall, and I guess this fall is when I expect that we can hack

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.960
the crap out of that, because usually it takes the PC version to be able to break it open

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.720
on both console and PC.

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:30.720
Awesome.

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:36.600
And then finally, you better get on this quick if you're a Sonic fan, the Sonic Generations

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.040
demo is out now, but it will only be live for 20 days.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:47.760
And actually, it's 20 days actually earlier.

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:57.680
So it will be running I guess from now through July 28th, and you can check it out on Xbox

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.480
Live Marketplace or the Playstation Network.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:07.520
And also kind of going with that if you're in the Japanese region or have a jailbroken

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:14.600
phone or device, you can check out the iOS app that's available through the Japanese

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:22.400
app store, and it includes Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 and a minigame called Sonic the

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:28.080
Sketchhog as well as a news feed and weekly wallpaper downloads.

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:34.240
Sorry, I got distracted.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.200
Fucking Tumblr, I swear to God.

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.200
What?

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.960
No, Tumblr is banned during the show.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.040
This is the best one ever though.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.600
Just look at Alan's Tumblr.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.480
He posts the craziest shit.

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.960
Today I will get shit done by visitor LLLNOPE Tumbler.

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.120
Alright, moving on.

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.400
I'll show the chatroom.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.840
Hey, this is serious news you guys.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:05.720
Yu Suzuki has revealed in a Gamasutra interview, he is leaving his management position at AM2,

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.960
which is, you know, he will be, it's part of his company that develops games.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:16.000
He will be at Sega as an advisor, but he will be kind of leaving his more management roles.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
So there you go.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Do you see this?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.240
Dan and Yu Suzuki.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.600
So how does that make you feel as such a Yu Suzuki fan?

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:29.880
This was E3 like seven years ago.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:32.200
He looks so young.

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:35.580
Are you sad or are you just like, oh, well, you know, these things happen?

01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:42.680
As long as he's still, as long as his great influence will still be upon Sega, Sega will

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.320
never really die.

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:51.160
Well in more news, you can file next to Duh and of course PopCap, who in an unrelated

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:57.040
story, has, I guess, rumors going around that somebody wants to buy PopCap for $1 billion.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.040
Please don't be Activision.

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:01.240
But yeah, apparently PopCap might be sold for $1 billion.

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.800
That actually isn't the story I was going to say.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.880
Duh and of course Bejeweled 3 is coming to consoles.

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.880
Hey Rob.

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:09.880
What?

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.960
You know who's rumored to be buying PopCap, right?

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.480
I heard it was EA.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.480
Zynga.

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.480
Oh God.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.480
Sheez.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480
Barf.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:22.480
Speaking of Sega and Zynga, I was driving home from San Francisco last night and as

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.640
I got on the freeway, I drove by the old Sega building that now has the Zynga logo on it.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.640
I cried.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:36.760
Bejeweled 3 on the DS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in the last quarter of 2011, of course

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.480
you know that Bejeweled 3 is coming.

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.840
And one of these games, you better get it or else it's going to be gone.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.720
And this was kind of a big one, TMNT.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.840
That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the hipsters.

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.280
TMNT re-shelled.

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:52.440
It will no longer be available after June 30th.

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.980
This is your last chance to buy it.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.040
It will be gone in a few days time.

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.620
This has to do with licensing.

01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:01.000
It's not that it's getting delisted because it sucks.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.320
Which I don't even know if any games ever really were delisted because they suck.

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:05.860
Usually it's a license thing.

01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:10.660
But if you want to get TMNT re-shelled, which was the arcade game but kind of redone graphics

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:13.720
and so forth, get it now.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:14.720
Or never get it.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:16.920
Those are your choices.

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.800
Dark Sakura's got some rapid fire news for us.

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.560
Then we'll get to the Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:26.220
Well this should make a lot of fanboys, you know, need new panties.

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:30.560
New Dragon Age 2 download content is going to be available.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.560
Five achievements.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:37.680
There's actually no new, no price on it quite yet, but the achievements will be for a total

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.400
of 120 points.

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:44.880
That is conduct or defeat an ancient evil in the Denmark mountains.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.740
Deep root safari, kill a bunch of stuff.

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:50.960
Family legacy, apply three effects to Hawk's Key.

01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.360
Family outing, that's the main quest in the mountains with Bethany or Carver in the party.

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:58.920
And towns, you know, actually I got Carver killed and didn't really give a shit about

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.140
Bethany.

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:06.880
And tower sweeper, where you do every side quest in the mountain prison tower.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:14.300
Then there's actually a public monument being made to Gary Gygax, who is one of the creators

01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:16.120
of D&D.

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:20.200
And it is in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.280
It better be a huge mungus D20.

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.240
And it better be a natural 20.

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:31.920
It better be a 12-sider, because dude, it's all about playing warrior class.

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.320
I'm kidding, I played mages.

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:40.640
And last but never least, more Wii U news.

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:46.800
Every single time somebody says that, I always hear in my head the chick from Kung Pao.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.800
Of course.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:55.560
Anyway, Masahiro Sakurai is basically quoted as saying that another Smash Brothers game

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:59.480
is years away for Wii U and 3DS.

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:03.880
They're putting all of their effort into Kid Icarus Uprising.

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:11.460
And he said that it makes him cringe that he's got more projects on his plate.

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:12.460
What makes him cringe?

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:15.700
The fact that they're announcing games like five years before they're coming out.

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:17.260
Is that the part that makes him cringe?

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:20.920
The fact that he's, I don't know, just putting his credibility online.

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.880
Hey, by the way, we're going to have a new Mario game.

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.560
Mario's going to come out and be alive in your house.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.840
Oh, that's not coming out for 50 years though.

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.460
The quote, it makes me cringe that I'm not sure it's the smartest thing to make gamers

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.160
wait for several years.

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:39.440
But the early announcement was made chiefly in order to attract new team members.

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:42.700
We've got no plans whatsoever, we've got two new games out there in the open when there's

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:44.680
no extra time to work on them all.

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:48.200
So basically he's being pretty upfront about it, saying, I don't know why they told you

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.820
all this early, but here you go.

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:52.280
To attracting new team members.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:53.280
Apparently they need work.

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.320
Well, there's people over here who don't have jobs who can design pretty well, and I'll

01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:59.120
design your manual for you if you pay me a lot.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:02.840
I would think that they would be able to put that up on, I don't know, a job posting or

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:08.480
something like that instead of saying, hey, fans of, hey, guess what, fans of Smash Brothers.

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.740
There's a game coming.

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:12.840
Would you rather have someone working on a project that actually cares about the project

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:14.920
or somebody who's just worried about throwing out crap?

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:20.200
Well, I would have, I'd rather they care about it, but also rather they, I don't know, don't

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.600
announce it before you have even started the game.

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.800
I think it was more- It's an inevitability anyway.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.800
I was about to say the same thing, I was thinking more in the name of inevitability, new Nintendo

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.440
console, yeah, of course, we're going to put our new Smash Brothers, but we'll do it later.

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.720
Hypothetically, games that are going to be coming out then.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:38.160
I mean, since they're out there- Microsoft did it too.

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.720
They announced Alan Wake with the 360 five years later.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:43.920
Okay, but it was probably in development.

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:48.800
It wasn't something that they said, eh, well, you know, there's a difference between delay,

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.960
delay, delay, and the difference between, yeah, well, we haven't really started the

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:54.960
game yet.

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.560
I mean- It's just, so we wrote it down on a piece of paper.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.560
You know it's coming out.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:54:59.560
You know we're going to.

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:00.560
We just haven't started on it.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.220
Hey, wouldn't you guys like a Smash Brothers game on the 3DS?

01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:05.440
We would too.

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.920
So that's why we're going to work on one someday.

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:15.960
It's like, that's what Nintendo was announcing at E3, shit that they don't even have started

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.960
yet.

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.600
They're probably on the drive in or walking up on it and saying, hey, you know what, we

01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.720
should tell them that there's a new Smash Brothers coming out.

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:24.720
Yeah.

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:32.520
All right, let's get to some Twitter topics, twitter.com slash o-l-r, tweet, tweet, tweet,

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520
every week.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:39.200
We need you here every week just for that part.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:44.000
Every week you guys send us tweets, but only tonight we'll just sing.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.200
Twitter.com slash o-l-r, we have a handful of tweets tonight.

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.040
I want to start tonight with a completely random tweet from Flaming Toilet who sends

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:58.480
us a tweet that's a retweet from Agent M. Behold, the 25th anniversary DVD collection

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:04.280
of the Golden Girls and we get linked to a post on Yes Tumblers, which is I guess this

01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:08.120
Golden Girls collection that comes in a gigantic purse.

01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.560
It's all seven seasons on DVD with a deck of playing cards as well.

01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:16.160
Better come with like a gift certificate to Cheesecake Factory.

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.160
When's that coming out?

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:18.160
Soon.

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.160
I don't know.

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.160
I didn't see the date.

01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.300
I would think that Applebee's would be more appropriate.

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.440
But I loved Flaming Toilet's comment.

01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:28.320
Now if we could just get them to include an official game in that box set.

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.320
Yeah.

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:30.320
I'm hoping.

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.040
And don't forget about maybe having the first season of Golden Palace.

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.040
Oh God.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.040
Do you remember that?

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:37.040
Yeah.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:38.040
Oh, they linked it to Amazon.

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.040
Oh, gee.

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.040
The low, low price of 182 bucks.

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.040
Geez.

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.040
Let's see.

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.040
When is it out?

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.040
That is still cheaper than Deep Space Nine for the record.

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.040
It's out.

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.040
I don't know.

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.040
That's a lot of Betty White.

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.040
It's out now.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.040
In stock.

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.040
Buy it now.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.040
It's my birthday.

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.040
Just saying.

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.040
All right.

01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:00.680
Moving on, let's see, going to S2 100 Matt.

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:07.920
A guy is shipping himself 2,000 plus miles in a crate while playing Lord of the Rings

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.920
online.

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.500
Surprisingly for a good cause too.

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.800
This might be relevant to Jessica's interests.

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:15.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.480
Yeah, we were just talking earlier about shipping Drunami in a crate.

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.480
Which server, dammit.

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.480
There he is.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.640
He's in a crate playing on a PC there.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.320
That is not comfortable looking.

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.320
What's his name?

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:34.160
Performance artist, Jordan Wayne Long, starting on July 7th, he will be confined to a small

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:35.420
wooden box.

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:42.260
He's being shipped from Bald Knob, Arkansas.

01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:43.260
He's going to...

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:44.880
And we're back to the penis joke.

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.800
Being all alone in that box, he's going to have a Bald Knob by the time he's done.

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:53.000
Well, you know, there's only so much you can do during, you know, but it is summer festival,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.620
so...

01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.800
You're going to get bored of Lord of the Rings online eventually.

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.240
A man's got needs.

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:01.680
Bald Knob, Arkansas to Portland, Oregon.

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.880
Just picture him finding some cute little elf.

01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:04.880
It will be...

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:05.880
Oh yeah.

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.880
Oh yeah.

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:07.880
He'll be...

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:11.920
He'll have to find which port to put his Bald Knob in.

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:13.720
Why the fuck is he doing it?

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.460
The reasons apparently are mixed.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:19.520
He wants to provide entertainment through his Twitter account.

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.120
He also aims to better understand post-traumatic stress disorder.

01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.520
Many individuals who experienced traumatic events...

01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:27.520
What?

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:28.520
Is this a joke?

01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:29.520
Are you going to tell me this is a hoax?

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.520
No, no.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.520
It's not a hoax.

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:32.520
Here's why he's doing it.

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.200
Attention whore is why he's doing it.

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.200
Because he's a poor artist.

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:40.720
I'm doing an art project where I'm going to ship myself in a container and play Lord of

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:41.720
the Rings.

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:43.400
It worked.

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:50.780
How is being in a shipping container while having entertainment, and at least you have

01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:56.060
one luxury, how is that causing PTSD in any way, shape, or form?

01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:57.960
How are you going to have post-traumatic stress disorder?

01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:59.800
He's playing Lord of the Rings online.

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:06.560
If you want to get PTSD, why don't you play Black Eyed Peas The Experience?

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:08.520
I don't get this.

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:13.100
I hope they put him in one of those shipping containers up in the airplanes where they

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:18.160
have no oxygen and sub-zero freezing temperatures and he freezes to death.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.160
That's what I hope happens to this guy.

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.960
He freezes to death.

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:26.240
I wish him death by freezing.

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.040
Now if that does happen, you're going to feel a little bad.

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.040
No, I'm not.

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040
I'm going to laugh.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.040
I'm going to laugh.

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:36.240
I'm on the record right now saying I will laugh my ass off for at least five minutes.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:43.360
Maybe to break it to you, but I don't think there's any major airports in Bald Knob.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.360
If there was.

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.360
Yes, there is.

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:46.640
Bald Knob International.

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:50.560
I don't think anybody could ever take it seriously if they had to take a flight from there.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.720
They have flights every day to Toronto and Guadalajara.

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:57.160
The views expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those of all the staff

01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:00.160
of Orange Lawns Radio.

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.760
Right?

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:08.080
And Frisbee says that can't be more than a four to five hour flight.

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.000
Dude, he's shipping himself UPS.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That's the problem.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
That's why it's going to take seven days.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.520
He's going to get lost, dumped in the ocean, you know.

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:17.920
They'll leave him on some back porch somewhere.

02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.920
Hold on.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:19.920
Hold on.

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:22.220
So why is he able to ship himself via, you know, UPS?

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:23.680
Because I'm pretty sure they have policies against him.

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:26.640
I don't know how he's shipping himself, but I just assumed it was UPS.

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.640
Old Dominion.

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:31.840
So I hope they're shipping him because they will lose that package.

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.000
Alright.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.360
Tiger Claw links us to some stories here real quick.

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.440
Remember GeoHot?

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:40.440
That's right.

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:45.720
The man behind the Sony PlayStation debacle when Sony was going to sue him.

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.600
Probably the whole reason why Sony got hacked a couple months ago.

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.440
Apparently, he's come out of this okay.

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.360
He's got a development gig now at Facebook.

02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.320
Yeah, this was, I guess, validated by a group called Techmeme.

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:01.320
I don't know.

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:06.560
But they tweeted a link to his private Facebook wall, which apparently called Facebook an

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.840
amazing place to work.

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.600
So it'll be interesting to see what he cooks up over at Facebook.

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.960
Also, one other link here from Tiger Claw on Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.080
Gameplay Theater Festival.

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.920
Speaking of performance art, here we go.

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.020
It combines gaming and performance art.

02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.600
If you're in Brooklyn, oh God, haven't these guys done this shit before?

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.700
I remember a Brooklyn theater and something about gaming.

02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:33.880
But the Brick Theater is going to be doing gameplay.

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:39.520
It's a theater festival comprised of gaming-oriented stage productions, musical performances, and

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.880
interactive performance art.

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.880
Let's see.

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:45.080
There's Romeo and Julietette.

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.700
It's a modern interpretation of Shakespeare's classic.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:51.960
It will be performed entirely within World of Warcraft.

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:59.000
Modal Kombat uses real guitars to control Mortal Kombat characters.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.280
There's a YouTube.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.280
I could play it.

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.500
Why don't they actually do a good Shakespeare play?

02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:07.600
Or I could go to the last tweet tonight from ActDeft.

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:08.600
Here's a good question.

02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:10.640
A question for our nine-year anniversary show.

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.000
I like this.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.640
What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.880
What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.080
I'll start with Loki.

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:25.080
He's opinionated.

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:28.200
I don't know.

02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:29.200
Come back to me.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.200
I'll think about this.

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.200
Dark Sakura?

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:36.280
Nothing's really surprising, you know?

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:42.720
It's anything that's exciting is cyclic because they're always, it's always going to be, I

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:46.720
read them on E3, all this stuff, blah, blah, blah, and then all of this blah, blah, blah.

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:48.340
So it really is going to go in a cycle.

02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:51.160
It's nothing stays really crazy.

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:58.080
I guess the monumental news of the whole nine years is that I'd like WoW now.

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:02.160
The most impactful news of the past, well, let me go to the guests first before I say

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:03.160
my opinion.

02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:04.160
Anybody?

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:05.160
Jiranami?

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:06.160
No?

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.160
Jess Carper passing?

02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:08.160
I don't know.

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:09.160
Anything you guys didn't think of?

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:11.300
I'm going to go along with Jamie's line of thinking of, oh my goodness, I'm actually

02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:16.040
playing an MMO, which for anybody who knows me is pretty shocking.

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:19.720
Maybe the advent of the MMO, if you will, over the past nine years.

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:24.560
I mean, granted Ultima online is a little bit over nine years old, but maybe the mainstreaming

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.560
of the MMO, it really, it would definitely be in the top five, I think for me.

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:33.360
It really, it really did like, and I've said so on the show before, but I've used to play

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.320
Gemstone back in the day when it was on AOL and you had to pay to play Gemstone when you

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.000
had to pay to do AOL by the hour.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.800
See, my first, when I first started into tech support and the whole IT world, I was surrounded

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:47.940
by guys who were playing EverQuest.

02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:50.680
So that was all I ever heard about was EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest.

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:54.800
And it was because of them that I swore off any kind of MMO ever.

02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:00.120
And here I am many, many, many, many years later and I'm addicted to Lotro.

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:03.000
So I don't know.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:10.120
For me, the most impacting Xbox Live is the biggest story I think that's happened in nine

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:11.120
years.

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:17.000
It took the Xbox particularly seriously until Xbox Live changed console gaming and not only

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.960
changed console gaming, it killed arcades.

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:24.160
And it changed the way we commune as a community.

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:27.920
And it's, you know, been imitated by other places.

02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:33.240
I think Xbox Live, it's part of the reason we have what, Dark Soccer's favorite word

02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:36.160
microtransactions now is because of Xbox Live.

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:39.960
Xbox Live, I think is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years.

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:45.280
And I'm still thinking just the whole really pushing the internet too.

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.800
How long do you think it'll actually be before they just give up on the concept of arcades

02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:49.800
altogether?

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:54.780
I don't think they ever will because the ticket gambling things will always be there.

02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:59.000
And I think there will always be a pinball machine in a bar.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:04.440
Well, at the same time though, just while I was going through Roseville Golf Land, I

02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:09.360
always make notes when I see new tick redemption games as well.

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.320
And there were only one or two.

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:15.080
It seems like even those are starting to slow down a little bit.

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:19.680
However Pachinko in Japan is still big.

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:23.600
The most surprising for me is kind of a tie.

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:26.760
I would say the Nintendo Wii.

02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:29.860
Just the fact that Nintendo did it.

02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:36.280
They had a vision and they were right and love them or hate them for it, they did it.

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:40.200
And the rise of Facebook games I think is very surprising.

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:43.640
Farmville might be the most surprising thing of the past nine years.

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:46.360
Again, love it or hate it, your grandma's playing it.

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:52.960
I have to go with the fact that Nintendo had this neat system that they developed called

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:54.200
the Revolution.

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:56.840
And at the last minute they thought, hey, you know what's a better name?

02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:01.580
Wii.

02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:03.640
And also Giant Enemy Crabs.

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.040
Some of the chatters disagree with me.

02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:09.080
I can't see how Xbox Live killed arcade gaming because you didn't have to leave the house

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:10.580
to go be with other people.

02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:11.580
That's why I say that.

02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:16.080
I mean, granted, it's one of several things that probably led to that.

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:20.100
But I think it made that whole community gaming, you didn't have to really leave the house

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:21.100
to do it.

02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:24.360
And that goes right hand in hand with the whole internet MMO thing.

02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:27.320
I think those are closely married together.

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:32.200
Just thinking back to the way things used to be, the arcade used to be a place that

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:34.160
people would go to hang out.

02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:38.960
Even before when, you know, we were actively playing as a group at Roseville Golf Land

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:41.000
and what have you back in the day.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.520
Earlier than that, you know, people were like, there's, at Birdcage Center, this is a place

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:50.520
that we used to have a Rocky at, they had an arcade.

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:55.980
It was one of the best and it was the thing to do was you would hang out and you would

02:06:55.980 --> 02:07:00.740
either go to the bowling alley, to the movies, or you would be hanging out in the arcade.

02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:07.360
And it was the social, basically the social mecca of that entire area.

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:14.760
So I think that essentially the internet and all of, you know, the MMOs, Xbox Live, what

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:19.000
have you, all of that has really, really led to the decline.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.320
I mean, it's nice to, you know, on a whim go to the arcade with your friends, but it's

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:28.280
not someplace you're going to be spending every single night like we were back in our

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:29.280
DDR days.

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.000
It just doesn't happen.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Yeah.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.760
So, and again, folks in the chat room still disagreeing with me over Xbox Live killing

02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.760
arcade games.

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.440
I'll give you that concession.

02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:41.600
It didn't single handedly do it, but I still stand by my answer.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.300
Xbox Live's the most important thing that happened in gaming in the past nine years.

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:47.060
And again, the Xbox would have failed without it.

02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:50.680
People did not take the Xbox seriously until you played Halo 2 online for the first time.

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:54.960
I mean, there was, of course, some people bought the system, but it did not take off

02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.960
until Xbox Live.

02:07:55.960 --> 02:08:01.840
And I think that really actually started, I think, from the Dreamcast, because a lot

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:06.040
more online games for a console came out with the Dreamcast.

02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:09.600
We had Phantasy Star Online in Japan, which didn't support their broadband adapter over

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:10.920
here, which was shitty.

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:12.620
Quake 3.

02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:16.040
So many games started coming out toward the end of the Dreamcast Live that used the online

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:17.040
support.

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:18.720
But Xbox Live centralized it, and that was huge.

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:19.720
Exactly.

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:22.240
See, that's what I'm saying is that the concept was there.

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:24.200
Sega was starting to push it, and you notice how quick...

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.560
Xbox didn't invent it, they just perfected it.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.400
Oh, Microsoft's way of gaming.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:31.640
They don't think of it always, they just perfect it.

02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:37.280
But in Japan, they had the Satellaview for Super Nintendo, where you could play online

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:38.600
games.

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:40.960
And what was the thing called for the Genesis?

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:41.960
The X-something.

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:46.220
Do you know what I'm talking about?

02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:49.360
The online Genesis thing that they had?

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:50.360
Sega Channel.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:51.360
Yeah, Sega Channel.

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.840
But it was starting there.

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:57.120
They had the right idea, and then I think it was just like, well, people are wanting

02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.120
to do this.

02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:00.120
Let's make it happen, and let's make it happen in a big way.

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:01.600
And that's where Xbox came in.

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.200
They basically took what everyone was thinking and like, okay, here.

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.240
Yeah, I think Black Wolf sums it up pretty well.

02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:10.160
It didn't catch on with the Dreamcast, and it didn't catch on with Sega Channel.

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:12.060
I mean, it was a great idea, but it didn't catch on.

02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:14.200
It needed Microsoft for the marketing.

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.440
And you know, that centralization, I think, is again the key word there too.

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.560
All right, let's move on past Twitter topics.

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.240
Let's get into some more gaming news.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:24.760
We have some more stories for you guys, FUs of the Week coming up as well.

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:27.000
At some point, we'll have a mailbag too.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:32.240
And then, of course, the calls, the Skypline at 1-877-GAME-OLR, but not just yet.

02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:33.240
First some stories.

02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:34.240
Loki.

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:40.680
Yes, there's a class action lawsuit against Sony, of course, about the PlayStation Network

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:42.160
outage.

02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:49.320
It is alleged, though, that part of this lawsuit is because they're saying that layoffs had

02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:53.400
an effect on the PlayStation Network making it vulnerable.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:10:00.640
Apparently, it says that a Sony online entertainment platform engineer claims that Sony's technicians

02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:05.880
only installed firewalls on an ad hoc basis after they determined that a particular user

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:10.680
was attempting to gain unauthorized access to the network.

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:17.000
And it says also that, I guess, Sony spent lavishly on security measures for its own

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.800
PlayStation dev network and didn't put the same effort or budget into securing users'

02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:23.800
data.

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:28.400
Because they only seem to care about themselves.

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:34.200
And also, I guess, that they enacted large-scale layoffs in March of this year, just weeks

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.240
before the massive data breach.

02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:39.840
Hmm.

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:42.320
That's a little coinkydink.

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:52.480
Um, yeah, so there's a whole lot of not nice things that are going on there.

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:54.520
I'm making Rob laugh.

02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:55.760
Tarzara's teaching me sign language.

02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:57.840
I thought I was going to say, no incur.

02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.320
Well, what do you think, though?

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.280
Is this really to blame for why PlayStation Network went down?

02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.280
I don't know.

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:08.160
I think just people really want to kick Sony while they're down, and this just seems a

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.160
little bit like...

02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:12.880
I mean, if they're spending a lot of money and time to secure their other network that

02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.840
has stuff that's important to Sony, but yet the stuff that's important to their consumers,

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.840
like I don't know their personal information, they just leave wide open, then yeah, that

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.480
does sound like a problem to me.

02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:26.940
I think at the end of the day, you know what I always say on this show, hackers gonna hack.

02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:34.120
And I think after everybody was very angered by the removal of Linux, I don't even think

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:38.540
if they could have had the higher security facility in the world, they probably still

02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:40.240
would have found a way to get in there and hack it.

02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:41.240
You know?

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.240
I just...

02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.240
I don't know.

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:44.240
Not that it makes it right.

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:45.880
Sony had every enemy in the world at that point.

02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:49.320
That's also like saying, you know, well, I left my doors unlocked in my house, so that's

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:55.200
why I got robbed, you know, versus, oh, well, my house was locked up like Fort Knox and

02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:58.400
had a security alarm and all this stuff, and I got robbed.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.600
Well, you know, that kind of security does deter people from hacking.

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:10.520
And you know, I mean, we can, you know, put out a bunch of what if scenarios out there

02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:15.600
for a whole, you know, bunch of things that they could have done, but they didn't do any

02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.400
of them, so we don't really need to.

02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.280
Stupidity in terms of security aside, you still don't blame the victim.

02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.860
All right.

02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:28.540
You can't say, oh, well, it's just, you know, why secure banks?

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:30.080
Bank robbers are gonna rob banks.

02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:34.240
I mean, that's, that's dumb.

02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:35.240
All right.

02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.240
Well, let's move on.

02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:39.760
Uh, you know, there was a lot of talk about, uh, this whole halo connect thing.

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:44.400
You remember the domain connect halo.com made everybody say, oh God, Microsoft's working

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:45.800
on a halo game with connect.

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:50.080
And then the halo anniversary edition was rumored, ultimately announced, and a lot of

02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:53.920
people assumed that it was going to have connect integration, but they didn't show it at E3.

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:58.620
Well, apparently, uh, there is this whole, I guess, thing going around that there's a

02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:05.400
better for connect, I guess, thing going on with, uh, the new halo game and, uh, Microsoft

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:11.420
studios, Phil Spencer, who's the boss there, uh, mentioned with game spot as a first party.

02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:15.160
We believe that connect will be important to all genres of games.

02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:18.700
Even games like halo anniversary has connect integration.

02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:24.360
So you can say confirmed connect integration with halo anniversary, but it may not be what

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:25.360
you think.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:30.560
There was a forum admin BS angel, like that name, uh, on the halo waypoint forums.

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:35.240
Uh, one of the admins said about halo anniversary's connect integration, just to let everybody

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:40.040
know the connect features we're exploring with halo anniversary are optional and won't

02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:42.720
affect your core gameplay experience.

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.660
Our mission from day one has been to deliver a faithful recreation of the original game.

02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:50.920
And we remain dedicated to seeing that through to completion.

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:54.520
This says to me that the connect stuff they're looking at integrating probably has nothing

02:13:54.520 --> 02:14:00.840
to do with the game itself, but it's going to be like voice commands in the menus or

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:03.160
I don't know, maybe using the connect to some microphone.

02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:09.000
So you can say obscenities to all the people on Xbox live from your couch or just little

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.040
dumb things that will connect.

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:17.000
No, I don't even think that just, or yeah, maybe a color for your outfit based on the

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.400
actual shirt you're wearing.

02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.560
Just really stupid shit like that.

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.120
That paint master chief.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.120
Yeah.

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.240
And I think that's the type of stuff now we're looking at is literally things tacked on to

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:31.160
just say, Hey, this game uses connect.

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:34.560
You know, it would be neat to do a map editor using connect.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:39.280
Yeah, but I don't see a halo map editor happening period, but it just occurred to me that it

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:44.520
would actually be cause you say move tree here because of forge member for just part

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:49.040
of the, or you could just go play Minecraft.

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.740
I had a nightmare about Minecraft.

02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:51.880
You had a nightmare about Minecraft?

02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:52.880
I sure did.

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:55.440
Did the goblins get through to your house or any of that stuff?

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.200
The goblins all had internet troll faces.

02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:00.200
I'm not even joking.

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.280
Penis man in our chat room says, I don't care if they add connect to halo.

02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:06.920
As long as I can play it with just a controller as the halo lover I am.

02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:09.280
There you go.

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.480
And black Wolf says face mapping under your helmet.

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:13.520
It's technology.

02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.520
So good.

02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.200
You can't even tell it's there anyhow.

02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:20.480
Also real quick about halo.

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:24.040
There is flaming helmets coming to halo reach.

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.040
That's right.

02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:29.120
If you register on bungee.net or through the recently released iOS app, you have until

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:35.600
the end of July 7th to get a flaming bungee head on fire, blue flame thing for halo reach.

02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:36.800
You can get that.

02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:41.080
And there's this cute little PSA they made about it from of course, red versus blue.

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:44.680
So guess what, Jessica, I can play halo and be flaming.

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.440
Hello, I'm flaming.

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.200
I'm playing halo.

02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:53.720
It's fabulous.

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:56.280
Dark Sakura, you have some news for us?

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.280
I have mail.

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:58.800
No, I've got news.

02:15:58.800 --> 02:15:59.800
You have mail.

02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:00.800
Excuse me.

02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:01.800
Burn the mail.

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:02.800
Okay.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:05.920
We got some birthday wishes in the mailbag.

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:11.960
Bit.Trip Saga and Bit.Trip Complete are being done on the 3DS and Wii and will be out on

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:15.080
the 13th of September in the US.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:18.120
But there's no European publisher yet.

02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.120
Sadness.

02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:22.880
But we'll have it here so everybody in Europe import it.

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:26.480
Those Bit.Trip games won't go away at all.

02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.920
You know, like those Bit.Trip games have been coming out for like years and years, but a

02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:33.040
lot of them are pretty cool, I got to say.

02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:34.040
Bit.Be.Trippin?

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:37.080
I like Bit.Trip Beat, even though they've released it like as many times as Bejeweled's

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.000
been released on all these different platforms, but still kind of an eet game.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Bit.Be.Trippin.Beats?

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Block Rockin' Beats.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.720
All right.

02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:47.200
Before we get to some more news.

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:49.320
Oh, look, it's the mailbag music.

02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:50.320
It must be time.

02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:51.320
Dang it.

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:52.320
I almost closed, oh, I closed everything.

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:53.320
My bad.

02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.840
I don't think so.

02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:56.240
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.320
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com and sometimes I remember to put it on the show roll because

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.320
this is a show where every gamer has a voice, usually.

02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.320
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.400
I know why you didn't do it because last week you read it and you thought that I might have

02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:10.680
laryngitis again this week.

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:11.680
Well guess what?

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:13.600
I did it out of consideration for you.

02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:15.680
Yeah, well.

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:17.600
This is from Rabba.

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:20.840
Here's one of the few stories that link games with less violence and crime.

02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:25.800
My take is, my take on this is, this is just a theory not scientific study.

02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:30.400
The only difference is they who, they can compare video game proliferation against the

02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:34.720
crime rates dropping by year, which is more objective data than the games cause violence

02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:40.920
wingnuts, which only seem to use handpicked data from poorly designed experiments.

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:48.360
And this actually comes from BBC, which honestly, world news from BBC is probably one of the

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.880
best sources to get it from.

02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:50.880
It's the BBC.

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:55.200
Well, keep in mind, you want your dry news, you get it from the BBC.

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.680
Without any of the, you know, sensationalism.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.160
Tonight on the BBC, blah blah blah, etc, etc.

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:04.560
But I've covered this on the show before.

02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:05.560
I think I'm coming.

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.560
Oh.

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:07.560
Oh.

02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:08.560
Oh dear.

02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:11.200
Isn't it nice to have a penis?

02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.840
Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:19.640
In 19, okay, it says 1985 crack market recruits youngest sellers and it's a relatively low

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.040
rate then.

02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.280
1991 peak murder rate, crack demand starts to fall.

02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:35.080
And it, it is actually, as of right now, the crime rate is lower for murder, that is, than

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.680
it was in 1970.

02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:42.600
And it hit its peak in, I think, around 19, yeah, 1991, 1982.

02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:49.320
And that robbery rates are also just slightly higher than murder rates, but still far low

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.520
what they were in 1970.

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.440
And that's coming from the FBI.

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:54.840
You know what that means, though, Rob.

02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.120
You know, on Wall Street you're hearing, sell crack, sell crack, sell crack, sell crack.

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.080
I'm posting a link to this in the chat room.

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:06.840
But I've covered that on the station before, because there was actually someone who did

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:12.720
an independent study using a number of different resources, including the FBI and various local

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:16.560
police accounts that came to the same conclusion.

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:19.160
Guess what came out in 1991?

02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.360
The NES, I do believe, in the United States.

02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:23.360
In 91?

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.680
91, no, the Super Nintendo.

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:28.120
Super Nintendo.

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:32.720
Unfortunately crack will be on the rise again and it's all thanks to video games.

02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.020
Thanks to a new video game that's going to be coming out this holiday season.

02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:38.080
It's called Being Bobby Brown.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.080
Let's take a look at a clip.

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.080
We got to live with stars.

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:41.080
We got to live with the anthrax.

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.080
Oh, you just watch too much TV.

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.080
I'm a true American.

02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.080
I've been to jail before.

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:45.080
That's American.

02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:46.080
Kiss my ass!

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:47.080
You kiss my ass?

02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.080
Kiss my ass!

02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.080
Fucking love that song.

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.080
Yeah, everybody.

02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:51.080
Bobby!

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:52.080
And, uh.

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.080
Bobby!

02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:54.080
Bobby!

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:55.080
Bobby!

02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:56.080
Bobby!

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.080
Bobby!

02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:58.080
Bobby!

02:19:58.080 --> 02:19:59.080
Bobby!

02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:00.080
Bobby!

02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:01.080
Bobby!

02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:02.080
Bobby!

02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:03.080
Bobby!

02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:10.400
Bobby! and I.

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:13.400
Whitney Houston, the experience coming out.

02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:15.440
Where's my drugs?

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:16.440
I'll tell you what.

02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:22.120
Whitney Houston, the experience would be better than Black Eyed Peas, the experience.

02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:23.120
I'm sorry.

02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:25.840
It would be, there's some of the experience there.

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:26.840
That's for sure.

02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:30.120
Well, anyway, they're, they're attributing some of this to the Obama effect, meaning

02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:38.280
that they're saying that having a, a black president is better, uh, a better role model.

02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:41.200
Where's my Kurt Cobain experience?

02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.240
And then there's a fall in demand for crack.

02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:45.480
It'd be a short game.

02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:46.480
Smarter.

02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:49.360
Obama being president means there's less of a demand for crack.

02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:50.840
I'm going number by number.

02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:51.840
The story's reaching.

02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:55.560
Smarter, uh, policing.

02:20:55.560 --> 02:21:03.160
Better tracking of numbers so that they can actually keep the flow of criminality down.

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:07.120
Increased availability of legal abortion.

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:11.680
And more criminals behind bars.

02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:17.360
Reducing of lead in gasoline is decreasing exposure to children, which is also contributing

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:19.040
to a fall in violent crime.

02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:20.800
The Baby Boomers grew up.

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.000
And video, okay, now this is it.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.160
This is the important one.

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:27.160
Number nine, a study released last month suggested video games were keeping young people off

02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:30.360
the streets and therefore away from crime.

02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:36.200
Researchers in Texas working with the Center for European Economic Research said this incapacitation

02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:41.780
effect more than offset any direct impact the contents of games may have had in encouraging

02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:42.780
violent behavior.

02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:46.280
So what you're saying is then they're just too fat to go outside and kill each other?

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:47.280
Pretty much.

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:48.280
Too lazy.

02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:49.280
Nah.

02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:51.280
It's, it's, it's more that-

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:55.360
I'd fucking kill you, but I'm feeling really high.

02:21:55.360 --> 02:22:01.560
And also the last one on there, and actually I like this one, the proliferation of camera

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:02.560
phones.

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.320
Meaning, oop, someone's robbing the ATM.

02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.320
Snap.

02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:09.620
Just saying.

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:10.620
Next email.

02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:11.620
Hey.

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:12.620
It's pretty valid.

02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:18.200
And at least it's better supported than, you know, all those other, you know, games are

02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:19.600
making my kids rob me right here.

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:24.720
And at the same time, the amateur porn market is thriving due to camera phones.

02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:28.000
Okay, this comes from Holly.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.560
Has there been anything on Microsoft's next console?

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:35.120
Do you think they are just keeping it under wraps or that maybe they haven't made anything

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:36.520
this time around?

02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:37.520
Under wraps.

02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:38.520
Maybe.

02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:41.240
I'd be kind of interested in seeing a portable from Microsoft.

02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:46.320
With the DS things have been coming out lately, I'm just not feeling Nintendo anymore.

02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:50.120
Nintendo seems to be focusing way too much on gimmicky things and way less on quality

02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.120
of games.

02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:55.760
No, not you, I'm sorry, I'm posing for a picture for two.

02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:56.760
Okay.

02:22:56.760 --> 02:23:01.080
My husband and I both recently got rid of our DS lights in all the games.

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:04.400
He had just bought the new Pokemon game but got bored with it after a week since it's

02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.400
pretty much the same game all over again.

02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:09.200
Actually, we also gave away our Wii to my mom as well.

02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:11.060
She's using it to watch Netflix.

02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:14.100
But when our Xbox died, we freaked and ran immediately by another one.

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:18.280
It's already Red Ringed once, didn't know if they'll cover it a second time.

02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:25.880
That's just saying, you know, we loaned out our Wii, but we've got three Xboxes now.

02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:33.120
As far as the new Xbox goes, there's gonna be tight-lid secret on that until at least

02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:37.580
next E3, maybe even one more, and it all has to do with not wanting to cannibalize sales

02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:39.760
of the current Xbox.

02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:43.040
Why would you buy an Xbox today with Kinect if you know something better is coming out

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:44.040
next year?

02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:49.280
There's a lot of people incentive to wait, so I'm gonna say that's your number one reason.

02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.560
It's not, to be honest, that's not specific to Xbox.

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:56.000
PlayStation 4 has been in development for years, I guarantee it.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.120
You're just not gonna hear about it for a little while, because they don't want to cannibalize

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:00.580
the PlayStation 3.

02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:02.760
Such is how the game industry works.

02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:04.400
Good lord, people.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:05.400
Okay.

02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:06.920
Hey, OLR crew!

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:10.560
AZHP here with congratulations and salutations for another year of OLR.

02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:15.160
I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate your birthday and your roots than an addition

02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:16.160
of Where Are They Now?

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:18.280
Bay Area DVR Players.

02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:25.780
FanaMacon was, a few weeks ago, Milton, Maple, and Gary, who was Shintengi, practically run

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.000
the show and I love them for it.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.240
Wendell is a trooper and ran Stage Zero day and night to keep folks in the convention

02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:31.240
center entertained.

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:36.520
And speaking of Stage Zero, the DS players, a dance crew formed mostly of old DVR freestylers,

02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:38.600
took the stage and blew everyone away.

02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:45.760
No longer satisfied to dance on panels in time to arrows the likes of AJ Sweetbanana,

02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:51.000
John Chaos, James Captain Canada, Lawrence Fuzzyhat, and many more cosplayed as random

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.840
completely non-anime related characters like Jesus, Jackie Chan, The Terminator, and Tigger

02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:59.840
while popping, locking, and breakdancing to the tunes of 8-bit remixes and old school

02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:00.840
funk.

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:04.560
They put on an amazing show and they inspire me to become a better dancer.

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.360
There was still stepping on arrows to be had as Jonas Explicit, who's been on the show

02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:15.560
quite a few times, who now runs the Big Anime Game Room, or Teabagger for short, at most

02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.000
Bay Area conventions, hosted a DVR freestyle tournament to try and relive the good old

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000
days.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.320
To prove that freestyle is dead, no one cared if you failed or even hit the arrows because

02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:30.200
no one here remembers how to dance and step on arrows at the same time.

02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:33.560
Bruce Leroy showed up and brought it back old school, but Chaos won with some excellent

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:34.560
locking.

02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:38.600
Mel B and Rain provided some sweet tunes at the Fanime Rave, and were the only two DJs

02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:41.120
who played music that anyone can dance to.

02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.800
I won't get into how I feel about anime con rave music here, but suffice to say that Mel

02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:48.600
B and Rain are following their passion of music.

02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:51.960
By the way, if you're really lost right now, these are all people that were very much like

02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.800
win, place, and show in the DVR tournaments of our day, so if you didn't follow that scene,

02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:57.800
you're a little lost right now.

02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:01.760
And I'm pretty sure that Hitori Hanzo was also part of the rave crew as well.

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.760
Yes.

02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:07.960
But I want to say, for those that were, this is a great email.

02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:10.520
Let's lose people further with a resounding, hi guys!

02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:11.520
Shut up.

02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:13.240
I'm actually totally...

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.160
I wanted to go to Fanime this year, but it didn't work out.

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:18.400
I'm going to Fanime next year, I don't care.

02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.320
Finally at Kentucky Con in Sacramento last weekend, I ran into Lil B, who showed up for

02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:25.200
a dance competition to win a thousand dollar grand prize.

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.720
For those who don't know, Lil B started dancing seriously around four or five years ago.

02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:32.740
From what I can hear from his sister, he dances all day and all night and wins dance competitions

02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:33.740
all over the Bay Area.

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:38.440
There was some fierce competition at Kentucky Con, but Lil B came out on top to claim the

02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:39.440
grand prize.

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:43.320
That man is still like five feet tall, but now he has transformed into a compact ball

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:46.760
of pure energy that exists only to dance and win.

02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:50.480
Also I went to Sviggle for the first time in about five years, and Corey Virtu was still

02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:51.480
there playing 2DX.

02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:54.720
It's nice to know that some things never change in life.

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:56.160
Zing.

02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:57.520
Except he's married now.

02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.520
Can you believe that?

02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:04.200
Didn't he like come just walk by you randomly one day and go douche or something?

02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.120
Uh, no, I think that was the other douche.

02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.120
I don't know.

02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:11.320
Or somebody, you know, somebody else did that and I was like, what?

02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.000
Let's talk about happier subjects.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.200
He did the, the, the bag of flour.

02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:18.160
Who did the bag of flour?

02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.160
That was Changer.

02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:20.160
That was Changer.

02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:21.160
That was.

02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:22.160
He didn't.

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.120
I thought that Corey did something else.

02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:28.460
Anyway, my brain, okay.

02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:29.960
It's nice to know some things never change in life.

02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:33.380
I hope you all enjoyed my edition of Where Are They Now?

02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:37.000
The prevailing theme is that the freestylers are still dancing just without the aid of

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.240
arrows and a dance pad.

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:42.380
Definitely check out the DS players on YouTube and we'll be locking as well.

02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:45.920
The way I see it, if a bunch of anime nerds who liked a dancing video game become one

02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.760
of the best crews in the Bay Area, anyone can learn to dance.

02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:50.240
Happy birthday, OLR, and I love you all.

02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:52.480
You're truly AZHP.

02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.480
Great email.

02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:54.480
Yes.

02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:55.480
Worth.

02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:56.480
For, for like 5% of the audience.

02:27:56.480 --> 02:27:57.480
I need some lighter.

02:27:57.480 --> 02:27:59.760
For everybody in this room.

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:00.760
Yes.

02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:01.760
Exactly.

02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:02.760
Memories.

02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:03.760
Okay.

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.760
Hi, all.

02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:05.760
Hi.

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:06.760
Hi.

02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:07.760
Hi.

02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:10.200
First off, I want to thank you guys for giving me so many tips for a horror point and click

02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:11.200
game.

02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:12.200
I started with Amnesia, The Dark Descent.

02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.280
I've never been so scared in my life.

02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.080
When my husband, who stood right behind me, said something to me, I shrieked and almost

02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:19.680
punched him in his manly hood.

02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:22.240
I would say your suggestion was a great success.

02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.640
Secondly, congrats on producing such a great podcast for nine years.

02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.160
I only hope that we perhaps can look forward to another nine years.

02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:35.880
I have two questions for, I have two questions for all of you.

02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:39.840
Since I'm an MMO addict, what do you think of the upcoming MMO, The Secret World?

02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.040
I'm hoping it will be really good, Horcrux, Lulu, etc.

02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.640
But I do fear that it might not be as good in the end as I want it to be.

02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:48.720
A bit what I got with Conan.

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:51.840
My second question, in these nine years of podcasting, what have you guys learned about

02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:52.960
yourselves in podcasting?

02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:55.000
Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Friends of love, Sil.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
P.S.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.600
I'm still going to Ninja Dark Sakura for an interview on Girls Gone Wow.

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:01.600
I'm down for it.

02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:03.920
Those are two completely different questions.

02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:06.760
The Secret World, I don't know much about it, but I'm doing a little bit of reading

02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:07.760
on it.

02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:10.700
And it sounds like it's the folks that made Age of Conan, so it ties into that.

02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:15.060
And Anarchy Online, it's being made for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.

02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:21.080
And there's no levels, no classes, it's all skill-based, so you don't have to level grind.

02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:26.040
And I guess there's several side quests and all that typical stuff you know on MMO.

02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:28.640
I don't know much about this game.

02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:31.680
I don't think they showed it in E3 this year, or if they did, it was a little bit under

02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:32.680
the radar.

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:34.160
So I don't know enough about it to really comment on it.

02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:36.280
I want to total call a Cthulhu MMO.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:41.640
I hope it's better than the Conan MMO was.

02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:44.560
Ju just said what I was seeing, where you're never going to get a character past level

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.560
five.

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:46.560
What was the second question?

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:49.640
The second question was something about podcasting itself, right?

02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:52.560
What have you guys learned about yourselves and podcasting, and do you have any tips for

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:53.560
the rookies out there?

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:54.560
Oh, God.

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:58.240
I've learned that I have a high tolerance for bullshit now.

02:29:58.240 --> 02:29:59.240
Not really.

02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:00.640
I don't have a high tolerance for bullshit.

02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:05.740
That's kind of a wide question, considering how much the whole process of quote-unquote

02:30:05.740 --> 02:30:09.200
podcasting has changed over the last nine years as well.

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.200
That's true.

02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:11.200
There was no podcasting when OLR started.

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:13.320
Yeah, there was no such thing as a podcast.

02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:18.200
There was just broadcasting on live 365, and boom, there you go, shoutcast server galore.

02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:23.440
I will tell you one big thing that I've learned just from being a quote public figure, because

02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:30.640
we would get emails from complete strangers, that when someone is saying that you need

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:36.280
to go back to the kitchen and that you're bringing down the podcast, it's sort of like,

02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:38.200
well, they don't know shit about me.

02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:39.200
I don't care.

02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:43.640
It was that point where I was like, I don't really care.

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.520
I can take whatever comes my way.

02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:49.880
I've got a lot of people supporting me, and really, those are the people that I'm doing

02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:50.880
this for.

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:51.880
Yeah.

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:52.880
Haters going to hate.

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:53.880
Exactly.

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:54.880
That was the big thing.

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:55.880
Haters going to hate.

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:59.320
And for every troll out there, look at the chat room.

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:03.640
People that are spending their Sunday nights listening to some schmoes on the internet

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:04.640
talk about hate.

02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:05.640
They could be in church.

02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:10.040
I mean, that's why to be here, but let me give you the number one piece of advice.

02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:15.080
I could do a podcast on podcasting, but let me give you the number one piece of advice.

02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:16.920
Maybe two pieces of advice.

02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:21.480
Number one, don't do a podcast because you want to be famous.

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:24.520
If you're doing it for that reason, you're doing it for the wrong reason.

02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:25.520
Trust me.

02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:26.520
You're getting into a very bad-

02:31:26.520 --> 02:31:27.520
I quit.

02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:28.520
Thing.

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:33.400
And the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio, the very first hundred episodes of

02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:38.480
Orange Lawns Radio were for 12 people, but they were 12 people that were giving up their

02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:41.160
Sunday nights to come listen to what we had to say.

02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:45.800
And it was like hanging out with your friends at dinner, at Brookfield's, Denny's, whatever

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:46.800
the place is.

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:49.120
Some of us still podcast to 12 people.

02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:50.120
Exactly.

02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:51.120
And if you're not-

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.120
But we love it.

02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:53.120
And that's the whole purpose.

02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:57.680
Because those are 12 bad-ass people that you're having fun with.

02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:04.920
So podcast because you like that sense of community, no matter how big your community

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:05.920
is.

02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:09.200
I made a lot of friends all over the world.

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:10.200
And they've sent us this.

02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:11.200
It's not porn.

02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:12.200
I did.

02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:13.200
It's in that box.

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.200
No, it's not in that box.

02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:15.520
Do podcasting to get porn.

02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:18.920
There's actually not that box, but that box over there still has some of the stuff.

02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:19.920
I know.

02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:20.920
I know.

02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:21.920
Podcasting porn.

02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:26.360
And then honestly, as far as the actual production of a podcast, quote unquote, my big thing,

02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:27.360
be enthusiastic.

02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:32.760
And you don't have to be like, oh my God, you guys, I'm so excited about games.

02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:37.000
No, just sound like you want to be doing a podcast.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Fabulous.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
What's that?

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Fabulous.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
No, for real.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.160
Like, just, just, I can't tell you how many podcasts I've heard where it's like, okay,

02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:53.400
so welcome to episode number five of Game Casts and we're going to talk about video

02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:54.400
games.

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.120
Would you like fries with that?

02:32:56.120 --> 02:33:00.320
You know, it's just like, sound reasonably happy.

02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:05.520
And I realize sometimes we're very harsh critics about video games here on the show, especially

02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:08.800
that guy sitting over there when it comes to Nintendo, but don't mistake.

02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:09.980
Don't talk to Drew like that.

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:10.980
Don't mistake enthusiasm.

02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:11.980
Fuck you, buddy.

02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:17.720
A lot of that is, when I say enthusiasm, a lot of that is really passion.

02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:21.320
Have a passion for what it is you're talking about.

02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.760
Even if you're talking about nothing.

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.080
Or talking out your ass.

02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:28.920
We rant and we rave because we actually give a damn.

02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:29.920
Talking out of my ass?

02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:30.920
What are you talking about?

02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:35.520
And don't do what I used to do every few years and do nothing but read Harry Potter books

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:36.520
during the podcast.

02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:41.760
SSTA 100 Matt in Chat says, I don't even remember what I did on Sunday nights before OLR.

02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:43.840
That's how long I've been listening to OLR, seven or eight years.

02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:44.840
I remember what I did.

02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:45.920
I slept.

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:50.160
I used to go to the goth club with Jessica.

02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:54.800
Yeah, that's why I was never around on Sundays.

02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:55.800
Funny enough.

02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:57.840
Ironically, that goth club sucks now, so.

02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:58.840
I know.

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:02.920
Well, I was just thinking about that two weeks ago because I heard about it in passing or

02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:06.720
something and I was just like, God, I haven't been there in nine years.

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:08.280
Yeah, it's still going.

02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:11.000
But it sucks now.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.500
It's all teeny boppers.

02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:13.500
Baby bats.

02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:14.500
Yeah.

02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:16.040
Complete batlings.

02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:17.680
I'm more goth than you.

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:21.080
Either that or I'll wear less clothing than you.

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:25.140
Did I tell you about me going to bat stay at Disneyland?

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:26.620
It was sad.

02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:30.120
It was a bunch of little hot topic.

02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:31.120
Baby goths.

02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:32.120
Burn down.

02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:37.160
I slept for this one chick who was wearing full black Victorian garb with the bustle

02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:41.880
and everything, pushing her baby in a lace covered pram.

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:43.280
It was the most adorable thing.

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:46.200
I was like, okay, you're doing actual gothic.

02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:47.200
Yeah.

02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:51.680
I'm catching up on some of the chat comments from chat.orangelandsradio.com because I was

02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:56.280
busy chatting about that last email and I'm catching up with your chats and I want to

02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:58.280
say this and then we can maybe go on to the next email.

02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:01.240
I love this comment from dark Tetsuya in the chat room.

02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:04.880
This is about the haters going to hate line that a dark soccer was talking about.

02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:05.880
Yeah, really.

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:09.440
You've been doing the radio podcast thing for nine years.

02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:12.840
What have they done with themselves in that time?

02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:18.440
They just right on dig, you know, and that was the whole thing is like the moment that

02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:23.300
I saw the sort of misogynistic comments, I was like, it has nothing to do with any type

02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:27.880
of talent or anything that I said they're going to be little, you know, dickless, you

02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:34.000
know, dick, peons wonder.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Next email.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Okay.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I'm actually replying to, to stills.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.000
I say something.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Look, I'm sending her my email.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.160
Oh, still was the guest on Horde house and she was fabulous.

02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:45.960
I'll reply to it later, but I'm sending still my re my regular email so that, oh, you girls

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:47.800
going to chat offline about pillow fights?

02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:49.640
No, about me being on girls gone.

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:50.640
Wow.

02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:51.640
Oh, okay.

02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:52.640
That's a fun show.

02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:53.640
Yeah.

02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:54.640
She wants to go wild on girls gone.

02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:55.640
Wow.

02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:56.640
Mm hmm.

02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:00.480
I want you to take your top off, get the record for the record.

02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:05.080
My tune has already danced mostly naked in front of the Lich King.

02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:06.080
Keep your ass out of gold.

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:07.080
Try her.

02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:11.760
There's pictures of my tune dancing naked in front of the Lich King before you go on

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:12.760
girls gone.

02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:13.760
Wow.

02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:14.760
I need you to do some research.

02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:18.320
I want you to roll a character on the moon guard server, take off all your clothes and

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.600
run to gold Shire and just, just watch.

02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:23.600
Really?

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:29.240
See, now you're giving me ideas, Rob, you realize you got on brandy wine.

02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:32.520
You realize that when we get back from pink Berry, that's the first thing I'm fucking

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:37.800
straight from our chat to Bree all the way to the Shire completely naked.

02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:38.800
Just saying.

02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:39.800
Damn it guys.

02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:40.800
Moon guard used to be good.

02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.800
We'll take technically they, um, they, uh, we'll shoot, um, I'd have to get to storm

02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:46.800
wind too.

02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:47.800
Is it from storm wind to gold Shire?

02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:48.800
I'll win the gold Shire.

02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:49.800
Yeah.

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:53.760
Let's roll a human next scene naked.

02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:54.760
Oh God.

02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:55.760
Okay.

02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:57.920
Dear OLR, I have nothing intelligent to say.

02:36:57.920 --> 02:36:58.920
Okay.

02:36:58.920 --> 02:36:59.920
By email.

02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:00.920
Okay.

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.200
But as a long time listener, I would like to wish you all a happy birthday and thank

02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:03.720
you for your dedication.

02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.160
Running for almost a decade is an incredible achievement.

02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:10.520
Sometimes I wonder how much an effect your show has had on me as I've grown up considering

02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:13.240
I've been listening since I was 14 or so.

02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:15.760
It's been the positive, positive one though.

02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:16.960
I'm glad you think so.

02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:21.880
I wonder what your parents think, please continue to do your show until the universe collapses

02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:25.480
in on itself or until at least the sun goes large enough to swallow the earth.

02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:26.800
Elliot the Afro guy.

02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:31.440
Oh God, I can't, I, I, there's been a few people, there was an iTunes review recently

02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:35.000
that said, but by the way, we love five star reviews on iTunes and I gotta say one of the

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:38.800
most recent ones that's there is somebody that was literally saying, I grew up on your

02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:44.880
show and like I, I really can't wrap my head around that comment.

02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:49.920
Like I know it's a compliment and I'm very thankful about it, but I literally can't Rob

02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:55.320
what you grew up on this show.

02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:56.680
No think about it.

02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:57.680
Okay.

02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:03.000
When you first started, when we first went off back in 2000 to the Rocky horror convention,

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000
you were what?

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.000
22.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Yeah.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:09.760
I still don't think you sir have grown up on this show.

02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:10.760
It's true.

02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:14.400
I, I can, I can agree that from, for myself because honestly when you're in your twenties

02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:17.040
you're still sort of in that teenage drama.

02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:19.120
It's why I can't listen to the old episodes at OLR.

02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.320
Like everybody always asks like, when are you going to post episode one?

02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:22.840
It's not that I'm embarrassed of episode one.

02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:24.040
I love episode one.

02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:25.120
That's just not you anymore.

02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:34.400
If I listen to it, I go that guy then I want to punch him in the face.

02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:38.000
I know I feel the same way going back on my left journal.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:44.440
I mean, you, you, you want clear cut evidence, how much I've grown you like,

02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:45.440
Mr. young Republican.

02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:46.440
Seriously.

02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:49.280
It's just take, well, at least he's more of a young libertarian.

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:50.280
Okay.

02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:52.280
I like my 2004 shit.

02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:56.000
This guy had hair longer than mine.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I got lazy.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.720
It actually looks good on you.

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:04.080
I'm due for another haircut anyway, but anyway, but I think, I think I can say safely that

02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:10.160
in ever since all of this started, cause I can, I'll even go back to, to usl.

02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:13.680
Cause that's, that's where I got my start was guessing on usl a whole bunch too.

02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:14.680
Oh sure.

02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:19.240
I mean, usl kind of, I w I will say for all the shit I've given Travis over the years

02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:22.920
and all this, and he says, you know, sometimes I refuse to acknowledge the show, whatever,

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:23.920
which you know, isn't true.

02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:29.800
I love or understation live, but let me say this about understation live is ceremoniously

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:31.480
passes the mic back over to me.

02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:33.400
No, no, it honest.

02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:38.240
It showed me that there is an audience.

02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:39.600
There's an audience for tickling guys.

02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.600
What the hell are you talking about?

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:50.600
You know, it definitely was the enabler because KCSC was one thing that was about trying to

02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:54.560
get into these pictures from that, by the way, that's when I thought I would be a radio

02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:55.560
DJ.

02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:56.560
Like that would be my gig.

02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:02.040
That was going to be my life was, you know, waking up with Rob on 97.7 this right here

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:07.320
is more reasons why you should listen from time to time because we even went so far back

02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:13.560
as Travis found the video from when we were on the news, when we were interviewed by Christina

02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:20.040
Warner because we were doing this, this thing that was so unique, that was never heard of

02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:21.040
in Sacramento.

02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:22.400
It was such a unique thing.

02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:27.880
And now, you know, everybody in their dog has a podcast, but we were doing it way back

02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:28.880
when.

02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:29.880
You know what it makes me think of?

02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:32.200
Oh, it's so much fun.

02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:36.880
By the way, that was the greatest moment in nine years of orange on radio.

02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:37.880
I will say it was that.

02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:40.240
Oh, it's so much fun.

02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.000
One of my favorite movies is a lot of our old school listeners know is pump up the volume

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
and it started it.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.440
But in the movie, it started with one guy with his shortwave radio.

02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:53.460
And at the end of the movie, everyone picked up a shortwave radio and wanted to get their

02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:54.460
voice out there.

02:40:54.460 --> 02:40:57.840
And that's kind of what I see things happening with the people who jumped onto podcasting

02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.600
right away and how it grew from there is that people are really finding that there's people

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:05.720
who listen to what they have to say.

02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:11.360
Still think we have a better audience than any kind of tickling guys ever could get.

02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:13.320
I will also say this about conversation live.

02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:20.120
The episode where we randomly called the bunny ranch and ended up talking to dude for like

02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:27.960
Dennis was trying to get me to go there for free and was possibly easily one of the top,

02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:28.960
maybe the top.

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:29.960
Oh, yeah.

02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:30.960
Thing that has ever.

02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:31.960
Oh, yeah.

02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:32.960
On Internet radio for me.

02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:38.480
You know, one of my favorites was on USO calling Disneyland when there were phones in the park.

02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:44.960
And then the Disney, you know, we we've actually been trying that recently, but it's so hard

02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:47.280
to find a live phone line in Disneyland anymore.

02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:49.320
Yeah, it's all so all of them.

02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:50.320
The only.

02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:51.320
Don't forget when we called Iraq.

02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:52.320
Yes.

02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:53.320
Iraq.

02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:56.640
We called a hotel in Iraq and we tried to book a hotel room for George Bush.

02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.720
Yes, I remember Charles.

02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:59.080
We're coming to get you.

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:00.080
That's terrible.

02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:01.080
Totally funny.

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.080
All right.

02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.640
Hey, whose birthday show is this?

02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:05.640
Okay.

02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:06.640
Last email.

02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:07.640
All caps.

02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:10.640
Bobby wishes all our happy birthday with a birthday taco.

02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:11.640
Tacos.

02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:12.640
All caps.

02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:13.640
Bobby.

02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:15.120
That's how you have to read.

02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:16.120
He's not pregnant.

02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:17.120
He just really likes tacos.

02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:18.120
That's how you have to read.

02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:19.120
All caps.

02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:20.960
I'm going to save the Bobby comments for his show.

02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:23.200
I always read Bobby's emails last.

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.880
He's got a six year anniversary and 300 episodes.

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:26.880
He's having a sex-a-versary.

02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:28.480
Thank you, Bobby.

02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:31.880
But now I think I'm all lowercase.

02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:37.240
All right.

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:38.240
Is that it for emails?

02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:39.240
Yarp.

02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:40.240
Thank God.

02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:41.240
No.

02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:42.240
No.

02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:43.240
No.

02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:44.240
No.

02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:45.240
No.

02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:46.240
No.

02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:47.240
No.

02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:48.240
No.

02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:49.240
No.

02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:50.980
Bobby was amongst all this talk of the bunny ranch.

02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:52.640
All right.

02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.140
Yes, unfortunately no bunny ranch came to transition into that, but we can talk a little

02:42:57.140 --> 02:42:58.400
bit about Bungee.

02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.980
Bungee's doing the kind of anniversary of Halo thing right now.

02:43:02.980 --> 02:43:04.780
Or I guess anniversary of Bungee.

02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:06.800
20 years of Bungee.

02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:12.400
And with that, a guy by the name of Daniel Bleszek.

02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:17.540
He's been working on an iPad port of Marathon.

02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:24.000
And I guess basically now it's almost ready to go and it's pending Apple's approval right

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.560
now for the low low price of zero dollars.

02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:33.580
And if that isn't enough, apparently they're also releasing the final game of the marathon

02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:37.900
trilogy Infinity to the open source community.

02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:42.960
So maybe that will also come to the iPad since it'll be open source and someone can port

02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:43.960
it over.

02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:44.960
Pretty awesome.

02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:53.700
Alright, and then, um, let's see, yeah, that's it for now.

02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:57.160
Alright, let's move on to a story about Silent Hill Downpour.

02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:02.540
Well guess what Silent Hill Downpour, or as some are calling it Silent Hill Alan Wake,

02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:06.340
Silent Hill Downpour will not have Pyramid Head.

02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:08.380
Aww, you guys, you guys know Pyramid Head, you love it?

02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:09.940
And it will not be good either.

02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:14.460
Unfortunately some of the people that played it at E3, I'm not hearing a whole lot of it,

02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:17.220
but it will have 100% more corn in it.

02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:21.820
It will have guns and they're saying they're treating the gun like the gun in the road

02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:24.940
by Cormac McCarthy.

02:44:24.940 --> 02:44:27.480
There is a gun, but there are only three bullets.

02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:28.980
So how will you use them?

02:44:28.980 --> 02:44:29.980
Hmm.

02:44:29.980 --> 02:44:32.060
Well, that was kind of always what Silent Hill was about.

02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:36.020
It was never about confronting things head on, but about, you know, what do you run from

02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:37.020
and what do you take on?

02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:42.060
And I don't know if that's, that doesn't sound like a totally new concept to me, but whatever.

02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:50.820
So yeah, so there won't be Pyramid Head, but there's supposedly will be some other scary

02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:51.820
people.

02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:52.820
Whoopee.

02:44:52.820 --> 02:44:53.820
Alright.

02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:54.820
Dark Sakura.

02:44:54.820 --> 02:45:02.500
You have to make, you know, a nice wide path for Shermy so she can waddle on through.

02:45:02.500 --> 02:45:03.500
Yeah.

02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:04.500
Poor baby.

02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:05.500
Okay.

02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:15.300
Valve likes the Wii U. Confirmed, Valve likes Wii.

02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:26.220
Gabe Newell said at New York's Games for Change Festival, that they like the Nintendo Wii

02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:32.220
U and he's quoted as saying Wii U seems to be a lot more powerful than the previous generation.

02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:37.400
It sort of fits better into the scalability in terms of graphics performance and CPU performance,

02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:41.940
so I think it'll be a lot easier for us to fit into our scalability model.

02:45:41.940 --> 02:45:44.220
We've always loved Nintendo.

02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:50.780
So they're saying that they are still looking into different console counterparts, starting

02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:55.300
with the 360 and recently moving to the PS3.

02:45:55.300 --> 02:46:00.420
They're saying that the Wii U is going to be scalable.

02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:05.220
Maybe in Portal 3, you can be GLaDOS with that whole little screen thing.

02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:08.180
All you control is the camera angle in the little room.

02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:09.180
Now you're the troll.

02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:14.340
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:32.620
It's the part of the show where we get Inkstein.

02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:38.020
FU to the remnants of my sinus infection deciding to move into my lungs.

02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:39.420
Evicted!

02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:46.460
Um, FU to having a headache.

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:53.220
Um, FU to the fact that I see a lot of things at Pride festivals that make me not have a

02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:54.220
lot of pride.

02:46:54.220 --> 02:47:00.620
And I'm talking about just drunk bitches that just go to get drunk and take their top off.

02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:06.020
Like it's just, I can't stand, it's like a frat party, some of that shit that I see going

02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:09.740
on in the streets and it's just, it's just dumb.

02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:10.740
I don't know.

02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:12.820
It doesn't make me happy.

02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:15.860
You want to show your pride protest something.

02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.340
That's how it all started.

02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:21.940
Uh, Jessica Harper, any FUs of the week you want to get out?

02:47:21.940 --> 02:47:29.940
Um, FU to judgmental types.

02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:30.940
And Drew Nami.

02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:36.220
Uh, FU to completely sucking any sort of a sales job.

02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:37.220
Lost my job.

02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:38.220
Oh well.

02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:44.540
And FU to scheduling conflicts and not being able to seem to be able to get money for all

02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:48.740
these great games and other essential shit I need to get done.

02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:51.140
At least a lot of them are going free to play.

02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:52.140
That's the silver lining.

02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:53.140
Ooh, yay.

02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:57.180
Alright, uh, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

02:47:57.180 --> 02:47:59.020
Loki, you got one more for us?

02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:00.020
Yes.

02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:05.740
Uh, you know, as if an ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace weren't annoying enough, they're

02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:07.380
going to now support Kinect.

02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:08.380
Awesome.

02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:14.940
So you spend $150 for the Kinect camera and you get to do wonderful things with your ads,

02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:22.340
including, um, getting them to retweet bullshit onto your Twitter account.

02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:26.700
By the way, anybody that retweets bullshit from the Xbox Live Marketplace is going to

02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:28.620
get unfollowed.

02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:30.820
Thank you very much.

02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:35.340
You can say, Xbox, tweet, to let people know that you love coke and not the good kind of

02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:38.340
coke.

02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:42.900
Or like, for example, you know, there may be a trailer for, you know, a movie or something,

02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:48.980
you can go, Xbox, near, and it'll show you, you know, the nearest retailer for whatever

02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:57.860
or, uh, you know, Xbox schedule for watching a TV show or some bullshit like that.

02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:03.180
And it just sounds dumb.

02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:10.500
Uh, one more story for you guys, and guys, this story made Jessica Harper cry.

02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:12.300
It's making me sad.

02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:17.180
And go figure, it's going to involve Billy Mitchell in a roundabout way, making Jessica

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.180
Harper cry.

02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:21.780
And, of course, Billy Mitchell was in a movie called The King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters.

02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:26.220
All right, it doesn't have to do directly with Billy Mitchell, but the director of King

02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:30.780
of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters, uh, who, which was, uh, what's his name?

02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:31.780
Seth Gordon.

02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:32.900
He was the director of this movie.

02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:36.340
He's apparently making a reboot of the movie War Games.

02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:37.340
Boo!

02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:43.260
That's right, uh, the 1983 movie starring Matthew Broderick, uh, about hackers.

02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:45.180
Oh, isn't this a timely story?

02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:46.740
Global thermonuclear war.

02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:49.860
Uh, there was even a ColecoVision game in 83.

02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:53.700
Uh, apparently he wants to reboot the movie War Games.

02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:57.140
Why does this piss you off, Jessica Harper, as if I need to ask?

02:49:57.140 --> 02:50:02.620
Um, because I'm getting really freaking tired that nobody can come up with a unique idea

02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:03.620
anymore.

02:50:03.620 --> 02:50:04.780
So, hey, let's redo this.

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:05.780
Hey, let's redo that.

02:50:05.780 --> 02:50:07.820
Hey, let's re- oh, wait, oh, Logan's Run.

02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:09.660
Yeah, that's been in production for how long now?

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:12.780
Oh, yeah, let's, uh, redo Pretty in Pink and-

02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:13.780
Or the trailer.

02:50:13.780 --> 02:50:14.780
Why?

02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:15.780
I saw a trailer the other day for Footloose.

02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:16.780
Yeah.

02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:18.780
And I was like, what?

02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:19.780
Yeah, it-

02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:20.780
Why?

02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:25.940
Because I completely understand that, you know, I- I- I know that I'm probably towards

02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:32.100
the end of the Gen X-er group, because, like, I think 77 was about the end.

02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:35.300
But at the same time, I know we're all getting older.

02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:40.620
I know that we're all in our late 30s and 40s, but please, please, we don't need to

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:46.100
relive the 80s so badly that we have to keep redoing all of these movies that were great

02:50:46.100 --> 02:50:47.100
to begin with.

02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:48.100
Stop it!

02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:49.100
Stop it now!

02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:51.820
Stop it now!

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:52.820
You know what?

02:50:52.820 --> 02:50:57.500
For a while, if you look at it, though, they were copying a lot of Japanese movies, especially

02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:59.180
in the horror genre.

02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:03.020
And then they started rebooting the horror movies, and now they're rebooting, you know-

02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:06.300
It's because everybody- it's like they don't have any unique ideas anymore.

02:51:06.300 --> 02:51:09.380
It's too hard for them to come up with something that is different.

02:51:09.380 --> 02:51:11.980
It's like if you want to get something good and different, you're just gonna have to go

02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:12.980
to the indie market.

02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:16.660
Speaking of revivals from the 80s that don't make sense, have you heard of the My Little

02:51:16.660 --> 02:51:17.660
Bronies phenomenon?

02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:18.660
Yes.

02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:28.100
It's apparently- when I was young, My Little Ponies was for girls, and if you liked My

02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:32.620
Little Ponies and you were a boy, you were an FAG, but apparently now-

02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:33.620
It's acceptable.

02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:39.340
It's acceptable, and it's like bros get together and drink beer and watch My Little Pony.

02:51:39.340 --> 02:51:44.180
Two words, periphery demographic, for the same reason that guys would like Powerpuff

02:51:44.180 --> 02:51:45.180
Girls.

02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:46.180
And I'm just like-

02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:49.260
It's been awesome, but I didn't buy into the whole brony crap.

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:50.260
Just like Poker Face.

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:53.100
You know what?

02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.900
When you said that, I started thinking of those little homies figures that you get out

02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:59.260
of the quarter machine mixed with a pony.

02:51:59.260 --> 02:52:03.100
It's like, you remember Secret of the Magic Crystal with the pink anus and everything?

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:04.420
I have that game.

02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:08.980
Imagine getting really high and or drunk and playing that game with your bros.

02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:11.420
That's what the My Little Bronies phenomenon is all about.

02:52:11.420 --> 02:52:15.740
I'm going to love and tolerate the fuck out of you.

02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:21.740
Plus on top of it now, they've actually completely redone the My Little Pony phenomenon.

02:52:21.740 --> 02:52:24.220
They've rebooted the entire thing.

02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:25.460
It went away for a little while.

02:52:25.460 --> 02:52:27.280
And Strawberry Shortcake.

02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:31.500
But they came out with all new episodes of My Little Ponies as well.

02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:36.180
Now it's supposed to be some really amazing, adults can enjoy it too.

02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:41.020
If you're going to do that, bring back something like Animaniacs, please.

02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:42.020
I know, right?

02:52:42.020 --> 02:52:49.100
I bet y'all can't wait for the Smurfs movie that's coming out.

02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:50.100
Further proves my point.

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:54.420
All I have to say, you touch Jem, I will fucking kill you.

02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:55.620
Oh, it's coming.

02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:56.620
I'm sure it's coming.

02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:57.620
I'll kill him.

02:52:57.620 --> 02:52:58.620
No, no.

02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:00.340
Except for that guy who does jizz.

02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:01.340
That's okay.

02:53:01.340 --> 02:53:02.340
That shit's funny.

02:53:02.340 --> 02:53:03.340
He already dealt with G.I.

02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:04.340
Joe.

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:06.220
I'm sure He-Man's coming soon too.

02:53:06.220 --> 02:53:08.360
You know what's actually kind of funny?

02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:16.020
My wife is terribly excited about the reboot of The Bodyguard with Rihanna.

02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.000
Because the first movie was so great.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:19.460
She loves it.

02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:20.460
It's a terrible movie.

02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:23.420
But she loves the movie and she's going to love The Bodyguard because it's a terrible

02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.420
movie.

02:53:24.420 --> 02:53:27.440
Because Whitney Houston cannot act at all.

02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:28.440
She is terrible.

02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:29.440
Period.

02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:30.440
All right, look.

02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:34.380
I'm opening up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:35.380
Give us a call.

02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:36.740
We're going to try and quickly get through calls tonight.

02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:38.900
So don't be surprised if I'm rushing you along in your call tonight.

02:53:38.900 --> 02:53:40.500
So I have your question ready.

02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:41.500
Or comment.

02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:42.500
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:44.060
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:44.060 --> 02:53:46.260
The Skype line is open right now.

02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:47.940
It's going to take about a minute for them to get the message.

02:53:47.940 --> 02:53:49.740
I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:54.300
Rob, by the way, said this while we were in the car coming back from Disneyland.

02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:55.780
The whole...

02:53:55.780 --> 02:53:59.860
No, when Bobby was talking about...

02:53:59.860 --> 02:54:00.860
Not Bobby.

02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:01.860
It was...

02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:02.860
Peter was talking about hanging out with us.

02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:05.240
It was like listening to an episode of OLR.

02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:07.180
Then he broke into the phone line spiel.

02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:09.300
I was like, that's it.

02:54:09.300 --> 02:54:12.500
Actually, you do say it exactly the same way every week.

02:54:12.500 --> 02:54:13.500
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:16.940
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:17.940
Give us a call.

02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:18.940
We'll talk.

02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:19.940
No big coffee talk.

02:54:19.940 --> 02:54:21.940
I'll give you a topic.

02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:22.940
Barbara.

02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:23.940
Mormon tabernacle choirs.

02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:25.940
Neither Mormon nor tabernac...

02:54:25.940 --> 02:54:27.700
Discuss.

02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:29.700
Talk amongst yourselves.

02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:30.860
Well...

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:33.940
I'm feeling verklempt.

02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:34.940
No calls.

02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:35.940
Let's...

02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:36.940
It takes a minute.

02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:37.940
We got like that minute buffer thing going on.

02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:38.940
What's wrong with you people?

02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:40.220
They haven't heard the number yet.

02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:41.220
They don't think the Skypline...

02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:45.740
And here I complain about our like five second buffer over on USL.

02:54:45.740 --> 02:54:49.620
They think we're bitching about my little bronies or whatever is still going on.

02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:51.740
So let's go to the Skypline and see who's there.

02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:52.740
See, now their calls are coming in.

02:54:52.740 --> 02:54:53.740
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:54:53.740 --> 02:54:54.740
Who's this?

02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:55.740
What up, guys?

02:54:55.740 --> 02:54:56.740
It's Xenocore from the OKC.

02:54:56.740 --> 02:54:57.740
How y'all doing?

02:54:57.740 --> 02:54:58.740
What is up, Xenocore?

02:54:58.740 --> 02:55:00.500
Yo, happy birthday, man.

02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:01.500
Thank you.

02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:02.500
Welcome to the high council.

02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:06.380
You get to rule the village now with the rest of us.

02:55:06.380 --> 02:55:07.380
Awesome.

02:55:07.380 --> 02:55:08.380
Can't wait.

02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:13.060
Unfortunately, I only have two cats to rule over.

02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:14.060
I'm not sure...

02:55:14.060 --> 02:55:15.060
I didn't get to the beginning of the show.

02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:18.060
Did you guys give out the news about Star Wars already?

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:20.020
No, we didn't.

02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:23.220
But now that you say it, I'm like, oh yeah, that was some pretty big news.

02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:25.860
But Xenocore, since you brought it up, I'll let you share.

02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:27.980
Well, they're turning it off.

02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:32.100
Galaxies is going away.

02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:35.180
Does this surprise you, though, with the new one coming out next year?

02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:36.180
Not at all.

02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:38.140
They're hurting is what they're doing.

02:55:38.140 --> 02:55:43.940
It's like sometime after the game, the servers are going offline in December.

02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:44.940
What you mean?

02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:48.160
That new player experience didn't revolutionize the game?

02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:50.180
Don't get me started, Rob.

02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:52.100
My bad.

02:55:52.100 --> 02:55:53.100
Don't mess with my...

02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:55.300
Did you hear that tone suddenly shift?

02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:56.620
Oh, no, you didn't.

02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:01.100
It's not so much that, but that's going to extend this show about another hour and a

02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:02.700
half if you get me on that.

02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:07.820
He had such powers, because it's so easy to become a Jedi now.

02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:11.420
But yeah, they're going to turn it off at the end of December, and they're just trying

02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:16.060
to hurt all the players, so the Old Republic is all they're really trying to do.

02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:20.540
What can other games learn from Star Wars Galaxies?

02:56:20.540 --> 02:56:25.340
Don't redesign the entire system without telling your players at a time.

02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.340
Pretty good idea.

02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:28.620
Yeah, pretty good idea.

02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:31.180
What do you most hope for when it comes out of the new Star Wars game?

02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:32.380
I imagine you're going to play it.

02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:35.380
If you were following the old one, you're probably going to try the new one, right?

02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:40.620
Yeah, I'm reserving myself until I see it in action, though, because although technically

02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:45.340
the old game did not have any levels, it was skill-based, you can never avoid grinding

02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:50.800
in an MMO, because you have to spend time using your skills to get better.

02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:52.940
So there's going to be a grind somewhere in there.

02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:54.540
It's almost impossible not to.

02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:55.540
All right.

02:56:55.540 --> 02:56:58.940
Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:02.540
Nah, man, just keep up the good work, man.

02:57:02.540 --> 02:57:03.540
All right.

02:57:03.540 --> 02:57:07.980
It's a good staple for Sunday to talk people right into Betty by when they're done.

02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:11.420
Well, we'll pour out a 40 for Star Wars this December.

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:17.620
Oh, and one short thing for the whole Bronies thing.

02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:22.500
That all got started on 4chan, and the series' head is a lurker on 4chan.

02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:26.340
They actually added a character that's now canonized in My Little Pony.

02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:27.340
What?

02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:29.940
Derpy Hooves.

02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:33.300
There was an editing mistake in the first episode to where one of the ponies was drawn

02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:38.340
cross-eyed, and so 4chan ran off with it and named her Derpy Hooves.

02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:40.660
I have to look this up.

02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:41.740
It's already on Know Your Meme.

02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:42.980
There's a reference for it already.

02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:44.780
Oh, oh, this just in?

02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:45.900
Yes, I've received a news bulletin.

02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:46.900
And Rocky Boom covered it as well.

02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:49.860
I'm throwing out my fucking television when I get home.

02:57:49.860 --> 02:57:51.500
Yes, that news just in.

02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:53.060
Yeah, and there it is.

02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:59.940
And on top of that, they wrote up 4chan came up with a backstory that she's a mail carrier.

02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:05.180
And since the series creator is a lurker on 4chan, she decided to incorporate it.

02:58:05.180 --> 02:58:09.780
So later on, she included this scene to where she messes up and drops some stuff on one

02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:14.620
of the main characters' heads, and they do a cut up in the air where all the Pegasus

02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:15.620
horses are looking at.

02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:20.620
And you see Derpy Hooves dropping something on top of the other characters.

02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:21.620
Xenocore?

02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:22.620
Xenocore?

02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:24.740
You know way too much about this.

02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:27.220
I found a picture.

02:58:27.220 --> 02:58:29.900
And it's on three news shows already.

02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:33.700
Are you now or have you ever been a brony?

02:58:33.700 --> 02:58:36.860
I found a picture of Derpy Hooves and put it on in the chat.

02:58:36.860 --> 02:58:37.860
Oh, hooray.

02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:39.880
All right, Xenocore, I'm just fucking with you.

02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:40.880
Have a good one.

02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:41.880
Thanks for the call.

02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:42.880
Y'all have a good show.

02:58:42.880 --> 02:58:43.880
Later.

02:58:43.880 --> 02:58:45.140
I am saving this.

02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:48.860
How do I feel about 4chan controlling what's on my television?

02:58:48.860 --> 02:58:51.020
I feel a little violated, actually.

02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:53.580
I love the name, though.

02:58:53.580 --> 02:58:54.580
Derp.

02:58:54.580 --> 02:58:55.580
Derp derp.

02:58:55.580 --> 02:59:02.060
877 Game O-L-R. A username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:03.060
Give us a call.

02:59:03.060 --> 02:59:04.060
We'll talk.

02:59:04.060 --> 02:59:09.940
Oh, do we have last minute stories, Loki?

02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:11.380
Oh, he's shaking his head.

02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:12.380
Nope.

02:59:12.380 --> 02:59:13.380
Not even trying.

02:59:13.380 --> 02:59:14.380
I don't care tonight.

02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:17.060
There's no way anyone can follow up Derpy Hooves.

02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:20.420
They'll try.

02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:25.900
So what do you hope happens in the next nine years of OrangeLoungeRadio, DarkSakura?

02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:27.540
We start getting paid.

02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:30.180
Good luck with that one.

02:59:30.180 --> 02:59:31.620
That would be nice.

02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:35.940
Remember when we were gonna, uh, remember when people were saying we should be on G4

02:59:35.940 --> 02:59:36.940
TV?

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:40.940
Hey, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:59:40.940 --> 02:59:41.940
Who's this?

02:59:41.940 --> 02:59:44.700
Hey, it's the one and only DJ Ron Maness from Anime GM Session.

02:59:44.700 --> 02:59:45.700
How are you guys doing tonight?

02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:46.900
I am fantastic.

02:59:46.900 --> 02:59:47.900
I'm super.

02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:48.900
Thanks for asking.

02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:49.900
How are you?

02:59:49.900 --> 02:59:54.660
I am good, and Rob, happy birthday, you fabulous, awesome guy, you.

02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:57.020
Thank you very much, nice man.

02:59:57.020 --> 02:59:58.020
Fabulous!

02:59:58.020 --> 02:59:59.020
Fabulous!

02:59:59.020 --> 03:00:01.620
What is up?

03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:04.820
What's on your mind?

03:00:04.820 --> 03:00:09.140
Before I get into that, I just wanted to say tonight's show is just pretty damn awesome.

03:00:09.140 --> 03:00:10.260
Well, thank you.

03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:13.420
Because no one's been drinking yet, and it's just been just awesome.

03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:15.100
No one's been drinking yet.

03:00:15.100 --> 03:00:16.100
We're high on life.

03:00:16.100 --> 03:00:17.100
Oh, really?

03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:18.620
I'm too old to drink now.

03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:20.380
My bladder can't handle it.

03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:21.380
Bullshit.

03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:24.500
Y'all are probably high on pixie sticks or something.

03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:27.300
God, here comes Dan, all right?

03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:28.300
Ah, shit.

03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:29.780
So what's on your mind tonight, Rama?

03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:30.900
What are you doing?

03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:38.260
I have in front of me a bottle of Captain Morgan and a double shot.

03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:44.860
A toast to OrangeLoungeRadio, its hosts, the fanbase, and a nine-year anniversary.

03:00:44.860 --> 03:00:48.220
Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.

03:00:48.220 --> 03:00:52.220
If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.

03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:53.220
Amen, brother!

03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:58.660
Well, I'm gonna feel that in the morning.

03:00:58.660 --> 03:01:01.300
I'll drink to that, bub.

03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:02.300
Mm-hmm.

03:01:02.300 --> 03:01:03.300
Awesome.

03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:04.300
So.

03:01:04.300 --> 03:01:05.300
Yes.

03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:09.860
Anything else you want to share with us tonight after that lovely toast?

03:01:09.860 --> 03:01:10.860
Maybe.

03:01:10.860 --> 03:01:11.860
What?

03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:13.420
If we should announce it live on air.

03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:15.140
Okay, I'm a little afraid.

03:01:15.140 --> 03:01:18.180
What are we gonna announce live on air?

03:01:18.180 --> 03:01:21.700
Something that we discussed on Twitter Friday night.

03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:23.820
What's that, Rama?

03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:27.580
Our little engagement.

03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:28.580
That's right.

03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:33.220
Since gay marriage passed in New York, which of course is a wonderful thing, you know,

03:01:33.220 --> 03:01:35.220
it's great, you know, hooray for equality.

03:01:35.220 --> 03:01:37.140
How are you and Rama getting married?

03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:41.140
Yeah, the first thing I did, I went to Twitter and I said, where's my marriage proposal,

03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:42.140
Rama?

03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:43.860
I knew it!

03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:47.740
Well, Rama, I'm not saying yes till I get a ring on it.

03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:52.380
It's, well, you'll get the ring faster than Salacious Pop will pop it on there, I guess.

03:01:52.380 --> 03:01:53.380
I don't know.

03:01:53.380 --> 03:02:00.100
No, I mean, Salacious Pop knows that he's the one for me, but you know, now and then,

03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:02.140
I like a little dark chocolate.

03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:10.100
Well, you know what they say, once you go black, you don't go black.

03:02:10.100 --> 03:02:16.380
You missed Dan in the other room, going, oh my god!

03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:19.740
Dan mad bro?

03:02:19.740 --> 03:02:21.740
You mad bro?

03:02:21.740 --> 03:02:29.820
Alright, well, Rama, until our honeymoon, I gotta say goodnight for now.

03:02:29.820 --> 03:02:31.580
That's quite alright, man.

03:02:31.580 --> 03:02:34.940
Just so you know, my girlfriend doesn't mind, because she plays on both sides.

03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:35.940
I know, it's hot.

03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:36.940
Alright.

03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:37.940
Hell yeah!

03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:38.940
Later.

03:02:38.940 --> 03:02:39.940
Later.

03:02:39.940 --> 03:02:40.940
Later.

03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:41.940
Later.

03:02:41.940 --> 03:02:42.940
Alright.

03:02:42.940 --> 03:02:43.940
1877 Game OLR.

03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:44.940
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:47.940
Give us a call, we'll talk.

03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:50.140
Are you sure?

03:02:50.140 --> 03:02:54.220
Maybe I'll get more marriage proposals tonight, who knows, we'll see what'll happen.

03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:58.220
Now you need, you know, SSJ100Matt to call you, you know, another, there you go, another

03:02:58.220 --> 03:02:59.220
New York.

03:02:59.220 --> 03:03:01.460
I know what you're looking at me for, Rob, swear to god.

03:03:01.460 --> 03:03:05.020
Salacious Pop's in chat, and he's just commented on the situation.

03:03:05.020 --> 03:03:09.180
He said the following, someone's about to wake up in the Hudson River, to be honest.

03:03:09.180 --> 03:03:15.980
I'm not sure if that was for me or Rama, I guess we'll find out.

03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:20.220
Bones006 says once you go bulk, you will never go back.

03:03:20.220 --> 03:03:22.220
Nice typo there.

03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:23.220
Alright.

03:03:23.220 --> 03:03:29.100
We've got time for one or two more calls.

03:03:29.100 --> 03:03:32.900
Rama said to Salacious Pop, oh baby heart.

03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:33.900
Oh.

03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:36.900
Snap snap, there's a call coming.

03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:37.900
Snap snap.

03:03:37.900 --> 03:03:38.900
Snap snap.

03:03:38.900 --> 03:03:40.860
Rama Renaissance Radio, who's this?

03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:42.940
Um, Nathan Legend.

03:03:42.940 --> 03:03:43.940
What is up?

03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:50.580
Well, I wanted to talk about Smurfs and 3D.

03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:53.340
First question in response, how high are you?

03:03:53.340 --> 03:03:54.860
La la la la la la.

03:03:54.860 --> 03:03:59.660
Alright, let's talk about this all at once, the Smurfs and 3D, all at once.

03:03:59.660 --> 03:04:05.780
Okay, so I think this is going to be the best movie of 2000 plus.

03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:07.340
How high do you have to be to think that?

03:04:07.340 --> 03:04:09.420
No, no, let's hear the man out.

03:04:09.420 --> 03:04:11.060
Every gamer gets a voice.

03:04:11.060 --> 03:04:12.580
Except you.

03:04:12.580 --> 03:04:17.940
Okay, so first of all, I use Smurfs in my daily language.

03:04:17.940 --> 03:04:23.060
So in order to complete my vocabulary, I say Smurf, I say, um, what Smurf is it?

03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:24.140
Like what time is it?

03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:28.860
So you know, I believe this movie will help us.

03:04:28.860 --> 03:04:31.660
You know what, you're getting Sonic Screwdriver.

03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:34.860
How does this game rate on a scale of one to five Smurfs?

03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:35.860
Exterminate!

03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:41.660
Is this game like a jokey Smurf or is it like Smurfette?

03:04:41.660 --> 03:04:45.740
Is this game a jokey Smurf or is it the one game in the village everybody else is going

03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:46.740
to bang?

03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:47.740
Smurfette.

03:04:47.740 --> 03:04:50.260
Now Smurfette's got younger competition, remember?

03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:53.980
I just want to say jokey Smurf, for legal reasons.

03:04:53.980 --> 03:05:00.100
So you really think that the Smurfs is going to be the greatest cultural phenomenon of

03:05:00.100 --> 03:05:01.100
our time.

03:05:01.100 --> 03:05:03.820
They're going to refer to this generation as the Smurf generation.

03:05:03.820 --> 03:05:08.500
Yes, it's going to change the economy and everything.

03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:10.020
Until the advent of derpy Smurf.

03:05:10.020 --> 03:05:13.060
We'll have to pay him Smurf Berries.

03:05:13.060 --> 03:05:17.060
And it's all because Obama's president, according to the BBC, apparently.

03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:21.820
Yes, we can't come up with Smurfs, yes we can.

03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:25.060
Yes we can, Smurfs, 2012.

03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:26.780
Papa Smurf for president.

03:05:26.780 --> 03:05:29.900
You can be a little old.

03:05:29.900 --> 03:05:32.460
And that means not from America.

03:05:32.460 --> 03:05:35.220
I'm from America, USA, USA.

03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:41.580
Now, you know, the sad thing is I probably would vote for Papa Smurf before you catch

03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:45.540
me voting for Michelle Bachman, but I'm not going to get political on this program.

03:05:45.540 --> 03:05:46.940
All right.

03:05:46.940 --> 03:05:47.940
Anyhow.

03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:48.940
Congratulations.

03:05:48.940 --> 03:05:49.940
All right.

03:05:49.940 --> 03:05:50.940
Thank you so much.

03:05:50.940 --> 03:05:53.980
And keep up the good Smurf.

03:05:53.980 --> 03:05:59.500
I have a response to that whole thing.

03:05:59.500 --> 03:06:01.480
You know what?

03:06:01.480 --> 03:06:05.980
One thing I will never regret about nine years of Orange Lounge Radio is phone calls like

03:06:05.980 --> 03:06:09.800
that.

03:06:09.800 --> 03:06:15.540
Things that just make you say, what the fuck, guys?

03:06:15.540 --> 03:06:16.540
You know what?

03:06:16.540 --> 03:06:21.340
Hey, the only downfall is that we don't have our Swede around.

03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:26.460
Because he had a call from the Swede.

03:06:26.460 --> 03:06:27.720
Is he not here tonight?

03:06:27.720 --> 03:06:29.340
I don't know that he's here.

03:06:29.340 --> 03:06:30.340
Oh, bummer.

03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:33.620
And he already told us he's not going to be in attendance at the 10th.

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:34.620
Why?

03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:36.780
Because he has some festival he has to be at.

03:06:36.780 --> 03:06:37.780
I'm like, Dernit.

03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:38.780
Festival?

03:06:38.780 --> 03:06:41.460
We have to have a Swedish call.

03:06:41.460 --> 03:06:43.260
Well, then fine.

03:06:43.260 --> 03:06:44.260
I'm going to have to call.

03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:45.260
I'll run outside.

03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:46.500
I'll say, hey, be right back, guys.

03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:47.500
I got to use the bathroom.

03:06:47.500 --> 03:06:48.500
I got to take a big dump.

03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:50.180
And then I'll go outside and I'll call my cell phone.

03:06:50.180 --> 03:06:52.860
Which is funny because the bathroom's like across the hall from the studio.

03:06:52.860 --> 03:06:54.420
Oh, this is the Swedish chef.

03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:55.420
Herbie derbie derbie der.

03:06:55.420 --> 03:06:57.060
And I'll just be the Swedish chef calling in.

03:06:57.060 --> 03:06:58.500
And it'll be incredibly racist.

03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:01.140
We could call the IKEA customer service line.

03:07:01.140 --> 03:07:02.140
Rob.

03:07:02.140 --> 03:07:04.940
I'll just play ABBA.

03:07:04.940 --> 03:07:07.420
Let's just settle on Mr. Bucket for president.

03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:10.140
Do not bring that to the show.

03:07:10.140 --> 03:07:11.140
Mr. Bucket.

03:07:11.140 --> 03:07:13.980
God, that thing is so funny.

03:07:13.980 --> 03:07:20.620
Did you watch the Angry Video Game Nerd when they were being haunted by Mr. Bucket?

03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:21.620
Do I want to know?

03:07:21.620 --> 03:07:22.620
No.

03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:23.620
I love the Angry Video Game Nerd.

03:07:23.620 --> 03:07:24.620
This was great.

03:07:24.620 --> 03:07:25.960
All right.

03:07:25.960 --> 03:07:27.500
Let's go to one more call here.

03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:28.500
Let's see what happens.

03:07:28.500 --> 03:07:29.500
Hi.

03:07:29.500 --> 03:07:30.500
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:07:30.500 --> 03:07:31.500
Who's this?

03:07:31.500 --> 03:07:32.500
That's Legend of Zaku.

03:07:32.500 --> 03:07:33.500
What is up, Zaku?

03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:34.500
Nothing much.

03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:37.460
Just getting ready for tomorrow for work.

03:07:37.460 --> 03:07:43.460
And just congratulating you on like what, nine years now that you've been on the air?

03:07:43.460 --> 03:07:44.460
Yeah.

03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:45.460
It's been about nine.

03:07:45.460 --> 03:07:48.260
So Zaku, you've been here for almost nine of those years.

03:07:48.260 --> 03:07:49.380
You've been here for quite a bit of it.

03:07:49.380 --> 03:07:50.380
I know that much.

03:07:50.380 --> 03:07:51.380
Yeah.

03:07:51.380 --> 03:07:52.380
I think I was here for seven of those.

03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:54.100
What do you think?

03:07:54.100 --> 03:07:57.100
There's an important question asked on Twitter a while ago.

03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:04.640
What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years of, what is the most impactful

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:08.680
thing that's happened in nine years of Orange, not just Orange Lounge Radio, but in nine

03:08:08.680 --> 03:08:10.220
years of video gaming?

03:08:10.220 --> 03:08:12.060
Oh, wow.

03:08:12.060 --> 03:08:13.060
Damn.

03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:17.380
That's a, well, I guess I could give you the benefit of both.

03:08:17.380 --> 03:08:23.120
Like for Orange Lounge Radio, you breaking away from Live 365, changing up the format.

03:08:23.120 --> 03:08:25.100
It's kind of like graduating.

03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:28.740
You start off with Imani, but now you're just encompassing video games in general.

03:08:28.740 --> 03:08:29.740
Yeah.

03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:30.740
We're out of pull-ups now.

03:08:30.740 --> 03:08:31.740
Right.

03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:32.740
Exactly.

03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:34.740
I'm a big kid now.

03:08:34.740 --> 03:08:35.740
Wow.

03:08:35.740 --> 03:08:36.740
Video gaming.

03:08:36.740 --> 03:08:37.900
Oh, wow.

03:08:37.900 --> 03:08:45.380
Just the fact that, you know, we've evolved from just from playing with controllers and,

03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:50.020
and you know, and through traditional channels like, you know, through the arcades, but just

03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:53.340
evolving to like not needing the controller at all.

03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:57.340
Meaning you're the controller, you know, you being the controller essentially with the

03:08:57.340 --> 03:08:58.340
Wii.

03:08:58.340 --> 03:09:02.980
Well, I know the Wii is kind of like you do need the controller, but you're using, you're

03:09:02.980 --> 03:09:09.140
using your extremities to actually, you know, to register input.

03:09:09.140 --> 03:09:12.220
I got one extremity I still can't use to play a game.

03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:15.460
Oh, I'm sure there's ways, sir.

03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:18.460
I am sure of it.

03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:19.460
You're just not thinking at all.

03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:22.580
First thing I'm doing when I get my copy of Child of Eden is I'm going to try playing

03:09:22.580 --> 03:09:24.700
with my dong.

03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:31.260
In nine years I've, in nine years I've seen basically, you know, Microsoft take like that

03:09:31.260 --> 03:09:36.860
little platform that could and just go far with, I have to admit, they didn't, they did

03:09:36.860 --> 03:09:39.740
10 times as better as the Atari Jaguar.

03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:43.020
Just be thankful listening audience that they don't have a cam right now.

03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:49.140
Sorry, I was doing my Child of Eden with my dong while you were talking, I'm sorry.

03:09:49.140 --> 03:09:50.780
Yeah, I mean, that's-

03:09:50.780 --> 03:09:52.660
Isn't that illegal in some states?

03:09:52.660 --> 03:09:53.660
Probably.

03:09:53.660 --> 03:09:56.300
So Rob, that won't work because you don't have a glove at the end to make it look like

03:09:56.300 --> 03:09:58.740
a hand because it still thinks it's a penis.

03:09:58.740 --> 03:09:59.740
Oh shit.

03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:00.740
All right.

03:10:00.740 --> 03:10:06.500
But yeah, it's like that, that whole evolution, like gaming, it's like, it's, it's going beyond

03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:11.620
what I, what I grew up with before then was just like, you know, going to a friend's place

03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:17.580
to play like Genesis and Super Nintendo games or the PlayStation, but it's like something

03:10:17.580 --> 03:10:24.420
that you could sit down, you could go online through Xbox or PS3 and just like, you know,

03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:26.900
get yelled at by, by 10 year old kids.

03:10:26.900 --> 03:10:30.780
You know, we've come a long way from the old school Atari 2600 controller, which if you

03:10:30.780 --> 03:10:32.940
think about it now was kind of phallic.

03:10:32.940 --> 03:10:35.180
I mean, yeah, it's, it's very archaic.

03:10:35.180 --> 03:10:42.700
It's like so primitive that it was just like, it was just a four way stick and a button.

03:10:42.700 --> 03:10:43.700
That's all it was.

03:10:43.700 --> 03:10:46.220
I'm saying a giant phallus basically.

03:10:46.220 --> 03:10:53.500
All the way down to like at least eight or, you know, at least eight to 10 actual controls

03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:55.900
on it, on a controller.

03:10:55.900 --> 03:11:01.180
And with the fact that you could actually like use your, use your body to, you know,

03:11:01.180 --> 03:11:02.180
to control things.

03:11:02.180 --> 03:11:07.140
I mean, the next step will probably be PS9 when they, when they insert, when they actually

03:11:07.140 --> 03:11:10.580
feed all that data into your, straight and straight into your head.

03:11:10.580 --> 03:11:11.580
It's the holodeck.

03:11:11.580 --> 03:11:14.860
I'm saying every generation of gaming is one step closer to the holodeck.

03:11:14.860 --> 03:11:15.860
Yeah, we're close.

03:11:15.860 --> 03:11:21.460
What we need is a VR headset, and we need headsets in which I can basically play back

03:11:21.460 --> 03:11:27.180
memories and other stuff, or just have that pipes, you know, directly into my brain.

03:11:27.180 --> 03:11:28.180
And that's it.

03:11:28.180 --> 03:11:33.260
I just literally sit there, close my eyes and that, and I've basically become, you know,

03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:34.400
that deeper into the game.

03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:37.900
You are the machine and then you're a Borg.

03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:40.620
I think you got Rob excited about pipes and deeper.

03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:42.420
I'm still thinking about my dong.

03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:47.500
Anyhow, all right, Zach, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but take care

03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:48.500
buddy.

03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:49.500
All right.

03:11:49.500 --> 03:11:50.500
Have a good one.

03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:51.500
Bye.

03:11:51.500 --> 03:11:52.500
1-877-GAMO-L-R-U-C-N-A-M-S-S-K-I-F-O-R-I-S-H-O-N-I-T-O.

03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:55.700
I guess we can do one more call.

03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:56.700
Sweet.

03:11:56.700 --> 03:12:01.700
I guess we could do one more call, whoever might call us on our nine year anniversary

03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:02.700
show.

03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:03.700
See what happens.

03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:10.100
Um, yeah, we're running a little long tonight, but whatever it's a birthday show.

03:12:10.100 --> 03:12:11.100
We can do that.

03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:16.380
Why are you complaining about something running a little long?

03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:20.700
I-D-K. Are you still reading about that derpy horse?

03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:27.120
I was trying, cause he said it had been, it was like a fan character that was, my intention

03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:31.380
on bringing up the My Little Brony thing was not to get you all addicted.

03:12:31.380 --> 03:12:33.660
That's actually not what I meant.

03:12:33.660 --> 03:12:35.980
Those are not, those are not baked goods.

03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:43.780
I am just reading the My Little Brony Friendship is Magic Wiki.

03:12:43.780 --> 03:12:45.980
Hey we have an Orange Launch Radio Wiki, did you know that?

03:12:45.980 --> 03:12:46.980
It's been updated.

03:12:46.980 --> 03:12:49.100
And if we can get a wiki, they can get it.

03:12:49.100 --> 03:12:50.660
I look at it weekly.

03:12:50.660 --> 03:12:51.660
Do you?

03:12:51.660 --> 03:12:53.560
Yes, when I have to pick the classic game.

03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:56.460
Let's go to another call, maybe this will be the last one.

03:12:56.460 --> 03:13:14.220
Why am I giving out the number again, if this is the last call?

03:13:14.220 --> 03:13:19.140
Jessica Harper has summoned the Swede, and just like that a wild Swede approaches.

03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:21.420
Quick, throw a pester ball.

03:13:21.420 --> 03:13:27.940
Queen, Queen, feel the beat.

03:13:27.940 --> 03:13:30.060
Oh well, what the hell.

03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:35.340
He started saying, no, but he started saying, no, it's like, yeah, Swedish music festivals

03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:41.100
are like, Efex Twin is fucking playing in Arvika!

03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:43.100
The fuck did he just say?

03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:50.180
Efex Twin, Richard D.J. is playing in Arvika, and I'm gonna see it.

03:13:50.180 --> 03:13:56.140
Oh, the Swedish Music Festival is the same weekend as the 10th anniversary of OLR.

03:13:56.140 --> 03:13:57.140
That's the whole thing.

03:13:57.140 --> 03:13:59.380
Yeah, fuck me, in other words.

03:13:59.380 --> 03:14:05.980
If we can't get the Swede on USL for our anniversary, then of course I'm gonna have to subject you

03:14:05.980 --> 03:14:13.540
to the Swede on your anniversary, so thank you very much, Akki Ripper.

03:14:13.540 --> 03:14:17.140
You heard it here first, 10th anniversary from the Swedish Music Festival.

03:14:17.140 --> 03:14:24.260
Here's the thing, if the Swede can't make it to 10 years of USL, then 20 years of USL

03:14:24.260 --> 03:14:25.260
will be in Sweden.

03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:26.260
Oh, okay, yeah.

03:14:26.260 --> 03:14:27.260
There we go.

03:14:27.260 --> 03:14:28.260
There you go.

03:14:28.260 --> 03:14:33.380
So we'll be the ones up at five something in the morning, because we have to maintain

03:14:33.380 --> 03:14:34.380
the time zone.

03:14:34.380 --> 03:14:41.740
No, it will actually be in Sweden so that Travis can start off the show by saying, Sweden,

03:14:41.740 --> 03:14:46.580
I am inside you.

03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:56.820
And that excites the owls far too much, obviously.

03:14:56.820 --> 03:15:00.580
To question from our chat room, Tiger Claw wants to know, is the Swedish Music Festival

03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:01.580
a rave?

03:15:01.580 --> 03:15:09.380
No, it's not, but it's like Arvika Festival is kinda in a way, yes.

03:15:09.380 --> 03:15:15.940
Let me ask you this, how many people will you make out with at the festival?

03:15:15.940 --> 03:15:19.100
If I know myself, none.

03:15:19.100 --> 03:15:20.740
Then it's not a rave.

03:15:20.740 --> 03:15:26.900
Well, the unfunny part is that, well, I'm like one of those, I don't know, because here's

03:15:26.900 --> 03:15:34.540
the unfunny part is that the thing is that I haven't went to a so-called classical Swedish

03:15:34.540 --> 03:15:41.980
Music Festival in like six or five years.

03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:45.880
So I don't know, I might be out of touch of sorts.

03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:49.580
See I think I can get closer and that's the only reason I stick with Pot-a-Pot-a-Paradise,

03:15:49.580 --> 03:15:51.460
drop E and hump the coin return.

03:15:51.460 --> 03:16:00.900
Okay, well, I have, but no, I'm way uncertain as far as I'm going to make out with anyone.

03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:06.100
And plus, by the way, but bonus point if I can find any CPI.

03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:11.340
Okay, Ripper, I'm going to let you have the last say here tonight on the Skype line and

03:16:11.340 --> 03:16:15.540
I want to know the question I've asked a few other callers that we got through Twitter.

03:16:15.540 --> 03:16:19.460
What's been the most impactful thing in the past nine years in gaming?

03:16:19.460 --> 03:16:34.020
Do you think that's, uh, I, I have no, I, the only thing that I can take up top of my

03:16:34.020 --> 03:16:38.260
head is like the Wii controller.

03:16:38.260 --> 03:16:40.260
What the hell?

03:16:40.260 --> 03:16:42.780
No, no, I, I'm sorry.

03:16:42.780 --> 03:16:49.500
I apologize to the rest of the listeners at this point, but Travis and I have to know.

03:16:49.500 --> 03:16:52.020
Have you shoved a Wii controller up your butt today?

03:16:52.020 --> 03:16:54.860
No, I have not, unfortunately.

03:16:54.860 --> 03:16:58.660
I have shoved other things up my butts as well.

03:16:58.660 --> 03:17:01.880
Thank you, sir.

03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:02.880
And he doesn't disappoint.

03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:04.660
And we'll end on that note.

03:17:04.660 --> 03:17:06.380
Thank you, Aki Ripper.

03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:08.020
Have fun at the Swedish Music Festival.

03:17:08.020 --> 03:17:20.820
Later, I can think no of no better way to cap off nine years of orange launch radio

03:17:20.820 --> 03:17:21.820
than that.

03:17:21.820 --> 03:17:23.220
Now we have 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.

03:17:23.220 --> 03:17:25.220
So bye everybody.

03:17:25.220 --> 03:17:31.140
I haven't shoved a Wii controller up my ass today, but I shoved something else up my ass.

03:17:31.140 --> 03:17:34.140
La la la la la la la la.

03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:36.340
Hey, Mr. DJ.

03:17:36.340 --> 03:17:38.300
Rob just turned red.

03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:42.180
You're welcome.

03:17:42.180 --> 03:17:43.580
You're so very, very welcome.

03:17:43.580 --> 03:17:47.780
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as if I need to ask tonight.

03:17:47.780 --> 03:17:51.780
Uh, Loki, thank you for being here, as you always are.

03:17:51.780 --> 03:17:52.820
No problem.

03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:55.060
And let's make it to year 10.

03:17:55.060 --> 03:17:56.380
What's your final thought tonight?

03:17:56.380 --> 03:18:00.620
My final thought tonight is Earth Defense Wars, Earth Insect Armageddon next week.

03:18:00.620 --> 03:18:03.060
I cannot wait to play it.

03:18:03.060 --> 03:18:04.060
Screw everything else.

03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:08.220
I don't give a crap about your fucking Black Eyed Peas experience.

03:18:08.220 --> 03:18:11.820
It's all about blowing up insects, large insects.

03:18:11.820 --> 03:18:14.180
Let me go to the guests tonight and get their final thoughts as well.

03:18:14.180 --> 03:18:17.340
Drew Nami, first off, our ever present intern.

03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:18.940
Good luck with everything going on in your personal life.

03:18:18.940 --> 03:18:21.740
I know you got a lot of change coming on the horizon, but we appreciate you stopping by

03:18:21.740 --> 03:18:24.820
to tip your hat at our little program, our dog and pony show.

03:18:24.820 --> 03:18:25.820
I'll be back.

03:18:25.820 --> 03:18:26.820
Uh, all right.

03:18:26.820 --> 03:18:28.700
Uh, your final thoughts tonight?

03:18:28.700 --> 03:18:32.940
Wii controller, what the hell?

03:18:32.940 --> 03:18:37.780
Jessica Harper, I don't know what to say to you right now.

03:18:37.780 --> 03:18:40.620
I think I'm going to thank you for being here tonight.

03:18:40.620 --> 03:18:45.620
I might take that back tomorrow once the ratings come in for the show.

03:18:45.620 --> 03:18:50.180
In all seriousness, best of luck on your audition, knock them dead.

03:18:50.180 --> 03:18:51.180
And let's karaoke sometime.

03:18:51.180 --> 03:18:52.180
That would be fun.

03:18:52.180 --> 03:18:53.180
Yeah, totally.

03:18:53.180 --> 03:18:54.900
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:18:54.900 --> 03:18:59.660
I'm just going to do my final thought as a nice big butt plug.

03:18:59.660 --> 03:19:06.740
And please guys, go ahead and go to understationlive.org and download some podcasts.

03:19:06.740 --> 03:19:07.740

And they let Aki Ripper go for like 20 minutes sometimes.

03:19:15.260 --> 03:19:19.980
So Travis has the common decency to hang up on people too.

03:19:19.980 --> 03:19:22.140
All right.

03:19:22.140 --> 03:19:24.980
And let's see, I'll let, I'll let dark soccer go last.

03:19:24.980 --> 03:19:26.400
So I'll give my final thought.

03:19:26.400 --> 03:19:31.720
My final thought is, um, thank you everybody.

03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:32.720
That's my final thought.

03:19:32.720 --> 03:19:33.720
Thank you.

03:19:33.720 --> 03:19:34.720
Dark soccer.

03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:35.720
Your final thought.

03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:41.380
I live in a giant bucket.

03:19:41.380 --> 03:19:43.640
My spoon is too big.

03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:46.040
From all of us here at orange launch radio.

03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:50.900
Thank you for putting up with us for the past nine years.

03:19:50.900 --> 03:19:53.060
We do it for you.

03:19:53.060 --> 03:19:58.300
I'm not sure why you keep letting us do it to you, but thank you for being willing.

03:19:58.300 --> 03:20:08.840
If you've enjoyed the show, tell a friend about the show and maybe we'll see you next

03:20:08.840 --> 03:20:10.020
week.

03:20:10.020 --> 03:20:11.140
If we don't get canceled.

03:20:11.140 --> 03:20:12.140
Have a good night.

03:20:12.140 --> 03:20:22.060
