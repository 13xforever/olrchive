14000	19000	Tonight, June 5th, 2011, the E3 rumors start to roll in a day before the first press conference
19000	23000	The track listing for the Play for Japan benefit album is unveiled
23000	26000	And soon you can raise pets in The Sims 3
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	Orange Lounge Radio
38000	41000	We're going to talk about video games over the next three hours or so
41000	44000	And you can join us if you're listening to us live at All Games Radio
44000	46000	www.allgames.com
46000	50000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
50000	52000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
52000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-host, say hello to the one, the only, the lovely DarkSakura
59000	61000	Jamie Summers, how are you?
61000	63000	I'm recovering from my party
63000	66000	It's your party and you'll cry if you want to?
66000	68000	I cried when everyone left
68000	70000	I was like, they're gone
70000	73000	Now it wasn't your birthday, it wasn't a birthday party, so what was the party?
73000	77000	It was for me getting two associates degrees
77000	80000	After 15 years of going to college
80000	82000	You are a professional student
82000	84000	I've changed my major so many times it's the problem
84000	88000	So I got my art new media which is basically graphic design
88000	93000	I have liberal arts and then next spring I'll have social sciences
93000	95000	You just like to learn
95000	97000	Actually I really enjoy college, I do
97000	103000	If I could, if I could get paid to be a student like mystery shop teachers or something, that would be bliss
103000	105000	Mystery teachers
105000	107000	Seriously, I'd be mystery student
107000	109000	Mystery student
109000	111000	Yeah this teacher sucks
111000	113000	Rate my professor and all that stuff I guess
113000	115000	Put it in the student's hands
115000	117000	Are they hot or not?
117000	121000	Alright, the voice over there of course, the one and the only tech master, Loki
121000	122000	How you doing?
122000	123000	I'm doing good
123000	128000	Alright, by the way we were off last week so it's a little interesting to be back here after two weeks
128000	130000	But I hope you all had a good Memorial Day weekend
130000	132000	I don't know what you guys did
132000	134000	I went to Disneyland, it was fun
134000	136000	But what else is new here at Orange Lounge Radio?
136000	138000	I don't ever travel anywhere else
138000	139000	We're going again
139000	143000	I know and I'm going again this weekend and I'll get into more of that later on because it's kind of sick
143000	145000	Well, Loki what have you been up to?
145000	147000	What did you do with your days off?
147000	149000	Um, I don't remember
149000	151000	Probably not sleeping
151000	153000	Ah, it's that time huh?
153000	155000	We mean it's that time
155000	157000	It's been that time for ten months
159000	162000	I thought he was sleeping through the night, now he's not anymore?
162000	167000	Well, he sleeps through the night but he also wakes up about eight times during the night
167000	169000	I see, I see
169000	175000	Alright, well of course if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, Loki and the Mrs. gave birth to Josh what about nine months ago?
175000	176000	Ten months ago
176000	177000	He didn't give birth to him
177000	179000	Well you know what I mean
179000	181000	He was there when it happened
181000	183000	But he did not go through labor
183000	187000	He contributed, he made a very important contribution to the whole process
187000	190000	Yeah, but the woman does all the work
190000	191000	Here we go
191000	192000	Okay
192000	193000	You and your women's lib
193000	194000	No
194000	197000	Stop burning your bra here on this show
197000	199000	I'm not even wearing one
199000	201000	Alright, alright
201000	202000	Moving on
202000	204000	I'm in my pajamas for tonight's show
204000	208000	The chatters in chat.orangelandradio.com are like oh yeah, prove it
208000	209000	Alright, anyhow
209000	211000	Here I will
211000	214000	Here comes Dan who's on mic
214000	215000	Shut up
215000	217000	What did he say? I didn't even catch it
217000	218000	I didn't hear what he said either
218000	221000	Something blah blah irrational psycho, that's all I picked up
221000	222000	He just needs to shut up forever
222000	223000	That was enough for me
223000	225000	Go back to watching your pinball thing
225000	227000	Let's go back to of course video games
227000	229000	It's a big week for video games, I'm not sure if you heard
229000	232000	The E3 convention is coming up this week
232000	233000	We're going to be covering E3
233000	236000	I'm going to start off the show actually by talking about this and we'll get into our gaming week
236000	239000	Our schedule is like so screwed up over the next couple weeks
239000	240000	Because we didn't do a show last week
240000	242000	We're doing a show tonight
242000	244000	We're not doing a show next Sunday
244000	248000	Because we're doing shows Tuesday and Wednesday
248000	249000	This next week
249000	253000	They are live E3 specials, different place
253000	257000	They're not going to be at AllGames.com because there's other stuff going on
257000	261000	And we also wanted to help you guys learn about our brand new Ustream channel
261000	262000	Is now up and running
262000	264000	Our username there is OrangeLounge
264000	267000	More information will be available at OrangeLoungeTrader.com later this week
267000	270000	And best of all, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf
270000	273000	Who does the show before us here at AllGames Radio
273000	276000	Will be joining us over the Tuesday and Wednesday nights
276000	279000	To be talking about what he's observing at the show floor
279000	281000	What's going on behind the scenes at the press conferences
281000	285000	What Sony is filling five and a half hours with, pray tell, tomorrow night
285000	288000	And then Miklotov is also going to be joining us
288000	290000	They're both going to Nintendo's press thing
290000	293000	And will get to fill us in on what it was like to play
293000	295000	Whatever Nintendo's calling their new system
295000	298000	Without a three and a half hour wait
298000	300000	Or whatever long that line is going to be at E3
300000	302000	Which I am looking forward to not standing in
302000	306000	It's very strange because it's not like I haven't been to E3 before
306000	308000	I didn't go during the airport years
308000	311000	But it's going to be interesting doing coverage from this end of things
311000	316000	But I'm happy that we'll be able to produce something a lot more slick
316000	318000	Where we'll be able to take your calls
318000	320000	Have the live chat room which will still be in the same place
320000	322000	Chat.OrangeLoungeTrader.com
322000	324000	And let you guys interact with the E3 coverage
324000	325000	And of course, give your feedback
325000	328000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
328000	330000	And there will be voices here in the studio
330000	332000	Voices on the E3 show floor
332000	334000	And your voices out there all over the internet
334000	336000	Aw man, I gotta wait until Tuesday
336000	338000	For Nintendo, yeah
338000	340000	Just so you guys know how it's all going down
340000	342000	Tomorrow there is no expo
342000	344000	The expo floor is not open
344000	346000	But the E3 show kinda starts
346000	348000	Because that's when the press conferences start
348000	350000	Microsoft kicks it off in the morning
350000	352000	Then Sony is going to be in the evening
352000	354000	Scrunched in there, Ubisoft and EA
354000	356000	Konami already happened
356000	358000	Which we'll be getting to a little later
358000	360000	We'll talk about what they talked about
360000	362000	They're not doing their own conference
362000	364000	Also I noticed left out Activision
364000	366000	Unless I just completely overlooked it
366000	368000	Which is possible, I'm sure somebody in the chat room
368000	370000	Will jump in with that if I may say
370000	372000	They also tend to usually have a lot of announcements
372000	374000	Like Call of Duty will usually be shown as Sony
374000	376000	Or Microsoft's conference
376000	378000	It's like, woah, I've never seen that before on these
378000	380000	Consoles, yeah
380000	382000	My thought too is that Activision kinda really blew their load
382000	384000	Last year with that whole Eminem, Rihanna
384000	386000	All those celebs they paraded out
386000	388000	On stage for DJ Hero 2
388000	390000	Which then, well you know
390000	392000	It didn't end up doing so hot
392000	394000	Although it was a fine game, I enjoyed DJ Hero 2
394000	396000	Yeah, here I was asking
396000	398000	Because my boss is going, actually my boss
398000	400000	And our vice president of sales
400000	402000	The guy
402000	404000	Doesn't know anything about gaming
404000	406000	So he's going to E3
406000	408000	Awesome, anyway
408000	410000	So they're going, now it's like so you guys going to any of the
410000	412000	Parties or anything while you're there
412000	414000	It's like, no, it's not anything like
414000	416000	You know, when they had the DJ Hero 2
416000	418000	Thing where they had like, you know, people DJing
418000	420000	And Eminem and stuff like that
420000	422000	They're having, I don't remember which
422000	424000	Publisher it is, but someone's having a
424000	426000	Bowling night
426000	428000	Nice, nice, Black Wolf
428000	430000	Our good pal is in our chat room saying
430000	432000	Activision has a booth, but they don't have a concert
432000	434000	So it is, yeah
434000	436000	Whatever their big announcement is might be at one
436000	438000	Of the other press conferences, I think you're right on with that
438000	440000	So we'll say
440000	442000	They don't have really any big announcements
442000	444000	They've got to be this year
444000	446000	They've got to give us more details on the Bungie thing
446000	448000	Because right now, all they've got coming out
448000	450000	Well, they've announced everything up through the third quarter
450000	452000	As of last week
452000	454000	So they haven't announced their fourth quarter stuff
454000	456000	Other than Call of Duty
456000	458000	But
458000	460000	There's not a lot that they can really cram in there
460000	462000	Usually there's a
462000	464000	Guitar Hero game around that time
464000	466000	But I mean, they've got
466000	468000	What, the X-Men game
468000	470000	They've got the new Spider-Man game
470000	472000	They have a
472000	474000	Crappy Spyro game that has
474000	476000	Some stupid little toy thing that you've got to
476000	478000	Scan your toy in order to play the character
478000	480000	In the game
480000	482000	And then of course they've also got
482000	486000	I think they're going to have a big
486000	488000	I think they might be blowing a big announcement
488000	490000	About Diablo before
490000	492000	Before Blizzcon
492000	494000	Blizzard's all their own thing
494000	496000	They're not going to announce any of that
496000	498000	Activision has been the one calling the shots
498000	500000	For a little while, which is why some of us
500000	502000	Wow advocates think the game's gone
502000	504000	A little bit south the past couple of years
504000	506000	They may announce a console port
506000	508000	Because there's already rumors that they hired people
508000	510000	To port over the Playstation 3
510000	512000	I actually think that's exactly what the announcement's going to be
512000	514000	But we'll get into that later
514000	516000	We'll get into E3 predictions a little later on
516000	518000	Woohoo!
518000	520000	I'm going to try
520000	522000	We're going to go
522000	524000	This is definitely live radio here
524000	526000	We actually have a man on the ground
526000	528000	Already in LA who's also going to be joining us
528000	530000	On the Tuesday and Wednesday shows
530000	532000	We're actually going to give him a call right now
532000	534000	Live, unscripted
534000	536000	He's actually at some type of event already
536000	538000	And I want to get more details on that
538000	540000	I know he's already been by the convention center
540000	542000	So we're going to give our old buddy Miklotov a call
542000	544000	And see what's up in LA right now
546000	548000	This may be botched a little bit
548000	550000	He's at some event
550000	552000	And I'll get some more details on what's going on
552000	554000	It could be very noisy
554000	556000	Two ringing dingies
556000	558000	Hey Miklotov
558000	560000	Hey what's up
560000	562000	Hey not much, it's Rob of course
562000	564000	You know that because I've been text messaging you
564000	566000	Where are you at? You're at an event
566000	568000	The E3 parties have already started
568000	570000	What's going on?
570000	572000	Yeah this is the
572000	574000	What is this I'm at?
574000	576000	What am I at right now?
576000	578000	It's for Major Nelson's
578000	580000	Twitter
580000	582000	And it's
582000	584000	A huge meetup where they're giving away
584000	586000	Food and drinks
586000	588000	And free bowling
588000	590000	And most importantly
590000	592000	Passes to the
592000	594000	Fresher event tomorrow
594000	596000	Wait are you at a bowling alley?
598000	600000	Yes
600000	602000	No that's not it
602000	604000	Major Nelson's doing the bowling alley thing too
604000	606000	There you go
606000	608000	Well what's going on at the event?
608000	610000	Are there any games that you can see?
610000	612000	Anything or is it just a bunch of
612000	614000	Bros getting together tossing balls around
616000	618000	Here at the bowling alley
618000	620000	It's just some colored balloons
620000	622000	But I actually went into the
622000	624000	E3 expo hall
624000	626000	today and looked up what they have on board
626000	628000	Hold on hold on hold on
628000	630000	Put that on Twitter everybody
630000	632000	Microsoft unveils colored balloons
632000	634000	At E3
634000	636000	It's a brand new thing for the connect colored
636000	638000	This is almost as good as
638000	640000	Space suits last year
640000	642000	They are green and white
642000	644000	And I guess that's purple for connect
644000	646000	Breaking
646000	648000	Orange Lawns Radio exclusive
648000	650000	This is an exclusive report
650000	652000	I don't know what you're saying but they're about to get more tickets away
652000	654000	So I'm going to hang up on you. Goodbye
656000	658000	Yep that's just
658000	660000	That's exactly what it's going to sound like Tuesday and Wednesday
660000	662000	As well is that we'll get the nice professional
662000	664000	Radio call from Bobby Blackwolf
664000	666000	And then when he decides he's got to hang up to go to a swanky party
666000	668000	Then Megalotov is going to call us
668000	670000	Yeah I don't know what really happened today
670000	672000	But I saw some balloons
676000	678000	Go and run that IGN
678000	680000	Colored balloons
680000	682000	I remember where the space suits were last year
682000	684000	Cosmic jumpsuits or something like that
684000	686000	Space ponchos
686000	688000	I was just talking about that last night
688000	690000	Space ponchos
690000	692000	With Alan in the car
692000	694000	Let's move on and get into how is your gaming week
694000	696000	We always like to start off the show when it's not E3
696000	698000	With how is your gaming week
698000	700000	But tonight was a little special. Dark Soccer how is your gaming week
700000	702000	There was a crap load of rock band
702000	704000	Last night. We had rock band 3
704000	706000	And Beatles rock band going on last night
706000	708000	And I sang
708000	710000	A lot and my throat hurts
710000	712000	I haven't lost my voice
712000	714000	What did you sing? What are your specialties?
714000	716000	Well I don't have
716000	718000	The song that apparently everyone says I'm really good at
718000	720000	So I was
720000	722000	Singing um
722000	724000	Chemical romance
724000	726000	And uh
726000	728000	What else did I do?
728000	730000	9 in the afternoon. Panic at the Disco
730000	732000	Which is like one of my favorite songs
732000	734000	And um
734000	736000	I think I did some Kansas
738000	740000	And
740000	742000	Any chance we get you to hum a few bars?
742000	744000	No
744000	746000	And I also did
746000	748000	I sang just about everything that we did in Beatles
748000	750000	Rock band except for like 3 that
750000	752000	Drew Nami
752000	754000	Sang
754000	756000	He was at the party too
756000	758000	There was a blast from the past. Intern Drew. Good job
758000	760000	And um
760000	762000	I also played Wow
762000	764000	Which I did today
764000	766000	And yelled at the ship for not arriving on time
766000	768000	Or at least on time in my universe
770000	772000	Sorry I have to share this. Mikolatov just texted me
772000	774000	He's like you can call me back it was too loud
774000	776000	To hear the numbers. I'm like I will call when you have something
776000	778000	News besides colored balloons
778000	780000	Don't judge
780000	782000	Um
782000	784000	They're green and white
784000	786000	No shit
786000	788000	It's Xbox
788000	790000	And Dan's been playing LA Noire
790000	792000	And I've beat Portal 2 now
792000	794000	For like the 9th time
794000	796000	And I'm on my 10th playthrough
796000	798000	On single player mode
798000	800000	And I find something new every time
800000	802000	It's fun
802000	804000	But I finally got the Smash TV
804000	806000	Achievement Rob
806000	808000	Well all the other ones are easy
808000	810000	Except for the last one you have to get
810000	812000	Which is the room where
812000	814000	It's like you go in
814000	816000	And there's uh
816000	818000	Glass to your right
818000	820000	And then there's 3 turrets
820000	822000	And the button you need to press is in front of the turrets
822000	824000	On the other side of the glass
824000	826000	So you have to go across and send the
826000	828000	Little uh
828000	830000	Tube to send your blue goo across
830000	832000	But you have to throw the goo
832000	834000	And knock down 2 of the turrets
834000	836000	And then go in the hole
836000	838000	That's above the last turret
838000	840000	And manage to jump down with enough
840000	842000	momentum to where you land just behind the turret
842000	844000	Pick it up, carry it over
844000	846000	And set it down straight so that it does not fall over
846000	848000	And die to where it shoots bullets at Wheatley
848000	850000	And then
850000	852000	That's how you get the last one
852000	854000	That sounds complicated
854000	856000	It's super complicated and it took me something like
856000	858000	25 tries to do it because
858000	860000	I get motion sick
860000	862000	And after try number 15 I wanted to throw up
862000	864000	But I kept doing it
864000	866000	And I finally got it
866000	868000	And then I like saved the game and left the room
868000	870000	Hard work pays off
870000	872000	The other ones were super easy
872000	874000	Alright anything else for your gaming week?
874000	876000	Um
876000	878000	We had pie
878000	880000	Loki how was your gaming week?
880000	882000	Orange sickle cupcakes
882000	884000	My gaming week was alright I didn't play a whole lot
884000	886000	I played portal through a little bit again
886000	888000	Cheating all the way this time
888000	890000	Which is fun mainly just
890000	892000	Kill time
892000	894000	I didn't really want to play anything else
894000	896000	Um played more Grand Theft Auto as usual
896000	898000	And um
898000	900000	Let's see
900000	902000	Also a tiny little bit of
902000	904000	L.A. Noire didn't really get a whole lot of time
904000	906000	To play it
906000	908000	But I made it through you know like the first
908000	910000	Kind of case that you have there
910000	912000	Um it's interesting I mean
912000	914000	The game is really detailed but uh
914000	916000	I don't know I'd probably get into it
916000	918000	I just have to have some time to play it
918000	920000	That's pretty much it
920000	922000	Wow
922000	924000	Sounds like uh you had a pretty
924000	926000	Quick week for games
926000	928000	Yeah well I'm still working on
928000	930000	You know Grand Theft Auto mods
930000	932000	And a whole bunch
932000	934000	Of other garbage
934000	936000	Anything that you're kind of looking
936000	938000	Forward to with the next week? Any demos
938000	940000	That might hit the store that you're like ooh I gotta play that
940000	942000	No oh by the way my uh
942000	944000	Dev console got banned from
944000	946000	Partner net which is kind of disappointing
946000	948000	How'd that happen? How'd you get caught?
948000	950000	It's just they eventually ban all of them
950000	952000	You know after a while
952000	954000	But it doesn't matter there wasn't really
954000	956000	Anything on partner net that I wanted to play
956000	958000	It was all Xbox Live or arcade games
958000	960000	There's no like you know betas
960000	962000	For you know another Halo or something
962000	964000	Like that you're not gonna find anything juicy like that on there
964000	966000	Um and
966000	968000	It besides all those
968000	970000	Games that are on partner net
970000	972000	Other people aren't banned and those people
972000	974000	Leak out those games for everyone
974000	976000	Else with JTAG consoles so
976000	978000	Eh whatever I decided
978000	980000	To check to see if there's any E3 demos on there but
982000	984000	You're getting better about hiding that stuff
984000	986000	Eh whatever I
986000	988000	I don't really even care
988000	990000	Well if it's anything like last year like almost all the trailers
990000	992000	That will be at the press conference tomorrow
992000	994000	You will see then show up on E3 or
994000	996000	I'm sorry on Xbox to download so you know
996000	998000	You'll see it in glorious HD
998000	1000000	I'm not even worried about playing demos
1000000	1002000	For stuff um you know there are
1002000	1004000	Are some games that look really awesome
1004000	1006000	Like you know Saints Row 3
1006000	1008000	I was pretty excited for
1008000	1010000	From the get go cause I love Saints Row
1010000	1012000	It's just kinda it kept
1012000	1014000	The fun aspect and just the
1014000	1016000	Really over the top part
1016000	1018000	Of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
1018000	1020000	And they just keep building up on it and
1020000	1022000	You know the first game was sort of a Grand Theft Auto
1022000	1024000	Ripoff but it's really become kind of its own
1024000	1026000	Thing and I love
1026000	1028000	Just the whole game it's just
1028000	1030000	Really fun and the new
1030000	1032000	The new one that they have coming out this fall
1032000	1034000	It just looks amazing
1034000	1036000	I really I can't wait to play it
1036000	1038000	Even if they do announce a new
1038000	1040000	You know Grand Theft Auto game
1040000	1042000	I love both games both series I think can
1042000	1044000	Coexist because they're just kinda
1044000	1046000	Different I am very disappointed though
1046000	1048000	That the third um doesn't have
1048000	1050000	Online multiplayer
1050000	1052000	As far as like death matches and stuff goes
1052000	1054000	Because I mean I don't know
1054000	1056000	The first game was kinda
1056000	1058000	Eh it wasn't very good as far as
1058000	1060000	That they had online and the second game
1060000	1062000	They tried to mix it up a little bit but it was really
1062000	1064000	Wacky the way they had everything they really
1064000	1066000	Shoulda just stuck with you know
1066000	1068000	Kinda doing a Grand Theft Auto style where it's
1068000	1070000	Okay here's a portion of the map that you play
1070000	1072000	In and go you know something
1072000	1074000	Simple like that but uh they tried to
1074000	1076000	Do some funky stuff with it and it was alright
1076000	1078000	But it's the maps that they had are really
1078000	1080000	Kinda limited and you know
1080000	1082000	The fun is kinda limited too but at least they have
1082000	1084000	Online co-op for two players this time
1084000	1086000	Let me go um to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com
1086000	1088000	Uh and I think
1088000	1090000	Breakman's pretty much echoing something you just said here
1090000	1092000	Saints Row 3 doesn't have any multiplayer versus
1092000	1094000	Though frown. Yeah just uh
1094000	1096000	Two player online co-op like the second game
1096000	1098000	Which is fun you know cause I
1098000	1100000	I'm Grand Theft Auto so
1100000	1102000	Co-op can be fun. Yeah co-op is fun and
1102000	1104000	It was actually a lot of fun playing a
1104000	1106000	System Link co-op with uh
1106000	1108000	The second Saints Row game so I'm
1108000	1110000	I'm looking forward to this new one
1110000	1112000	For sure and I mean
1112000	1114000	You know
1114000	1116000	And you know right now I'm still playing lots of
1116000	1118000	Grand Theft Auto but that's gonna
1118000	1120000	Interrupt or something's gonna interrupt that
1120000	1122000	Though come July cause July
1122000	1124000	July 5th to be exact
1124000	1126000	Is when we get
1126000	1128000	The new Earth Defense Force game
1128000	1130000	Oh that's gonna be awesome
1130000	1132000	Counting down the days. Oh yeah
1132000	1134000	Alright let me get to my gaming week um
1134000	1136000	Quite a bit actually this week we'll start with demos
1136000	1138000	You know I usually don't like to review
1138000	1140000	Games based on the demo but when a big big demo
1140000	1142000	Comes out I like to kinda get my first impressions
1142000	1144000	On it uh Dungeon Siege 3 is the demo
1144000	1146000	I downloaded which is available uh
1146000	1148000	I was surprised that they were even gonna make a Dungeon
1148000	1150000	Siege 3 because I kinda thought the first two games
1150000	1152000	You know they they made their point they had their
1152000	1154000	Relevance of course they were PC only titles
1154000	1156000	Uh but now Square Enix
1156000	1158000	Is behind the publishing of this third
1158000	1160000	Game uh that's happening uh now
1160000	1162000	On the consoles uh and I believe
1162000	1164000	PCs later on so the demo's available
1164000	1166000	On Xbox Live. It's all the same time. Huh?
1166000	1168000	Yeah all the same time uh so the
1168000	1170000	Demo's now available on Xbox Live and it's very
1170000	1172000	Diablo-esque if you've never played Dungeon Siege
1172000	1174000	It's very Diablo it was kinda Microsoft's answer to Diablo
1174000	1176000	In some ways uh and so the game's very
1176000	1178000	Diablo-esque and uh it was okay
1178000	1180000	You know I had a good time playing it but um
1180000	1182000	I thought like especially
1182000	1184000	Following up a game like Torchlight
1184000	1186000	Uh it was nice to kinda see the more
1186000	1188000	Robust graphics and that Square
1188000	1190000	Enix Cinema presentation
1190000	1192000	Presentation style excuse me
1192000	1194000	Um was it something I'm excited
1194000	1196000	To spend $60 on? No
1196000	1198000	Not based off the demo but will I like
1198000	1200000	Get it or get it in a bargain bin? Sure absolutely
1200000	1202000	You know it's a very challenging
1202000	1204000	Position we're in right now in the gaming industry
1204000	1206000	With this whole it's gonna be interesting to see
1206000	1208000	What develops with this E3 because you know
1208000	1210000	Some games you are expected to pay $60
1210000	1212000	For some games like
1212000	1214000	Angry Birds you're expected to pay a dollar for
1214000	1216000	Or even get free and it's really about
1216000	1218000	Trying to find that happy price point and you know
1218000	1220000	We're talking about a new Nintendo console coming out
1220000	1222000	At E3. What are the games gonna cost?
1222000	1224000	Is Nintendo now gonna up the bar to $60?
1224000	1226000	Although some would argue they have
1226000	1228000	Been already
1228000	1230000	Oh yeah I don't doubt but are
1230000	1232000	The games gonna be worth it? I mean there's a certain point
1232000	1234000	Where the consumer goes hmm do I really
1234000	1236000	Buy this at $60 or do I just
1236000	1238000	Wait till it comes down in price or
1238000	1240000	I don't know like it's a tricky
1240000	1242000	NGP games are $50
1242000	1244000	Wow really
1244000	1246000	But PSP games were $50
1246000	1248000	Well not a lot of PSP games
1248000	1250000	Were $50 but there were a few
1250000	1252000	But like $40 is kind of you know
1252000	1254000	The price point
1254000	1256000	For the PSP but they did have $50
1256000	1258000	Games
1258000	1260000	So that's all I really want to say about the demo
1260000	1262000	It was cool
1262000	1264000	Fable 3 I got to play which is a game
1264000	1266000	Like a year and a half old so I bet a lot of you that were
1266000	1268000	Interested in this have probably already played it but
1268000	1270000	I was a little late to the party. I played the game
1270000	1272000	It's neat. There's a lot of concepts
1272000	1274000	In Fable I really like
1274000	1276000	But I sometimes wonder if this game tries to do
1276000	1278000	Too much and at its core
1278000	1280000	It's really repetitive
1280000	1282000	And it's like a Facebook game
1282000	1284000	Repetitive like
1284000	1286000	I like the fact that you do these quests
1286000	1288000	To enhance relationship with villagers
1288000	1290000	And I like this whole way that the
1290000	1292000	Villager enhancement thing is built in but when you're doing
1292000	1294000	The same fetch quest or the same
1294000	1296000	Delivery quest multiple
1296000	1298000	Times you're like okay
1298000	1300000	So what am I doing
1300000	1302000	Here you know and this is I felt like
1302000	1304000	It's just very very repetitive
1304000	1306000	I cannot trust anything Peter Milano
1306000	1308000	Says anymore I mean seriously
1308000	1310000	All of his innovative stuff is
1310000	1312000	Such bullshit because it's just like
1312000	1314000	Look at all this innovative stuff I added a dog
1314000	1316000	To my game no other game has had
1316000	1318000	Dogs in it before this dog
1318000	1320000	You'll love no I didn't give a shit about the
1320000	1322000	Dog yeah the dog was cool but you know what
1322000	1324000	The dog was as cool as any other dog in
1324000	1326000	Any other game the dog was actually
1326000	1328000	Kind of stupid sometimes the biggest
1328000	1330000	Crime for me that Fable 3 made
1330000	1332000	I don't feel it took the series
1332000	1334000	Forward I feel it took it back yeah I think
1334000	1336000	Fable 2 was a much better game
1336000	1338000	And I think it had that whole good
1338000	1340000	And evil thing developed and like Fable 3
1340000	1342000	I don't even notice it it really doesn't even seem like
1342000	1344000	That exists in it it's more about this whole
1344000	1346000	Path to being a king more politics
1346000	1348000	Which is a very repetitive
1348000	1350000	Grind
1350000	1352000	And I kind of got like I was really into it
1352000	1354000	For about an hour and a half and then I got bored of it
1354000	1356000	I got really bored of it and I was like you know
1356000	1358000	What I'm done I don't really want to play
1358000	1360000	Any more Fable 3 and uh
1360000	1362000	Yeah I feel bad saying it because there's a lot
1362000	1364000	That I like about the Fable
1364000	1366000	Series and I really liked Fable 2
1366000	1368000	I think Fable 3 was rushed
1368000	1370000	To be honest I think they needed to wait
1370000	1372000	Another year to put this game out there was a lot that was really
1372000	1374000	Glitchy in it too and just I didn't like
1374000	1376000	The map system and good lord the
1376000	1378000	Loading and like
1378000	1380000	Just watching the screen draw
1380000	1382000	Like oh
1382000	1384000	No this did not come out
1384000	1386000	Like you should have Dan got rid of ours
1386000	1388000	Yeah and luckily
1388000	1390000	I just borrowed this one so
1390000	1392000	I'm giving it back
1392000	1394000	So sorry Fable 3 gets a
1394000	1396000	Pass from me but the second one's good
1396000	1398000	Third one's crap
1398000	1400000	Not as good
1400000	1402000	So if they are announcing a new Fable game at E3
1402000	1404000	Which some think or I guess a Fable
1404000	1406000	Side, wasn't Fable 3 supposed to have Kinect
1406000	1408000	Later on? I'm kind of glad they
1408000	1410000	Didn't to be honest but if they spun it off
1410000	1412000	Into a whole new game I hope it's
1412000	1414000	Interesting
1414000	1416000	No
1416000	1418000	Anyhow
1418000	1420000	Katsune in our chat room says I got really bored with it
1420000	1422000	Quickly as well
1422000	1424000	And the whole
1424000	1426000	I know you all love this term
1426000	1428000	Microtransactions for like outfits
1428000	1430000	And weapons and stuff
1430000	1432000	No that was an obvious
1432000	1434000	Bad that was just
1434000	1436000	Microtransactions gone bad
1436000	1438000	I would never drop a penny on any of it
1438000	1440000	Period. Sorry
1440000	1442000	The other game I played
1442000	1444000	This week I got to watch
1444000	1446000	Alan play the Duke Nukem
1446000	1448000	Forever demo which hit
1448000	1450000	Steam over the weekend and
1450000	1452000	I have to admit I like
1452000	1454000	It's very tongue in cheek
1454000	1456000	It does not make any
1456000	1458000	Pauses about where exactly this
1458000	1460000	Game comes from. Have you seen Loki
1460000	1462000	The opening sequence to Duke Nukem Forever
1462000	1464000	In the demo? Ah yes
1464000	1466000	And I love that it starts in the
1466000	1468000	Whole football scene which is very reminiscent
1468000	1470000	Of the end of the last game which was in the football stadium
1470000	1472000	But then it
1472000	1474000	This is a little bit spoilery but deal with it
1474000	1476000	It's the first five minutes of the game
1476000	1478000	It pans out of the
1478000	1480000	Football field or whatever
1480000	1482000	And you see that Duke is actually
1482000	1484000	Playing the video game
1484000	1486000	And it pans out
1486000	1488000	So far that you see these two girls are actually
1488000	1490000	Giving him a blowjob while he's playing the game
1490000	1492000	They are the Molson twins by the way
1492000	1494000	The Molson twins
1494000	1496000	And they're like oh was that good for you
1496000	1498000	Or wholesome twins or something like that
1498000	1500000	It's basically the olson twins
1500000	1502000	And they said something like
1502000	1504000	Oh was the game good Duke
1504000	1506000	And he goes yeah well after 12 fucking
1506000	1508000	Years it better be
1508000	1510000	So I like that it made
1510000	1512000	No pauses about that but then
1512000	1514000	When Alan got into
1514000	1516000	The actual game all I heard was
1516000	1518000	This is hard this is bullshit
1518000	1520000	This is hard this game is hard
1520000	1522000	This is hard I hate this game this is bullshit
1522000	1524000	So apparently it's really cheap
1524000	1526000	Why doesn't he just play it on an easier setting
1526000	1528000	He is playing it on like easiest
1528000	1530000	Why doesn't he just get better
1530000	1532000	At games then
1532000	1534000	Tell him he needs to go back and play Duke Nukem 3D
1534000	1536000	I wish I could go back and play Duke Nukem 3D
1536000	1538000	I can't really
1538000	1540000	Accurately judge Duke Nukem forever
1540000	1542000	Until I play multiplayer
1542000	1544000	Because that's where everything Duke Nukem
1544000	1546000	I mean fuck single player in that game
1546000	1548000	Seriously it was not
1548000	1550000	I mean after level 1
1550000	1552000	1 where you have the stripper
1552000	1554000	And everything like that it's forgettable
1554000	1556000	I actually really did like the single player
1556000	1558000	The single player levels were pretty awesome
1558000	1560000	I even like the atomic edition
1560000	1562000	With all the extra stuff that they added in there
1562000	1564000	Like I love the level that was basically
1564000	1566000	Disneyland which is pretty awesome
1566000	1568000	I love the one that was in a supermarket
1568000	1570000	They had one at like a post office and stuff like that
1570000	1572000	It was just those were kind of cool to me
1572000	1574000	I kind of feel like I should just go back and play Duke Nukem 3D
1574000	1576000	Yeah but see though
1576000	1578000	We tried that though on
1578000	1580000	Remember the 360 we all downloaded and got all excited
1580000	1582000	And it kind of sucked
1582000	1584000	Salacious Pop is yelling at me in the chat room
1584000	1586000	Lies and slander lies and slander
1586000	1588000	Lies and slander
1590000	1592000	That's what it sounded like to me my bad
1596000	1598000	I'm sleeping on the couch tonight
1598000	1600000	Alright um
1600000	1602000	Is he on Skype?
1602000	1604000	I could call him to defend himself
1604000	1606000	Do it
1606000	1608000	Hold on I'll look up his number
1608000	1610000	Isn't that sad I don't even know his number
1610000	1612000	Because we live in such a cell phone age
1612000	1614000	That I don't need it
1614000	1616000	I'm just going to call him and see what happens
1616000	1618000	I know my husband's number
1618000	1620000	Do do do do do do do do do do
1622000	1626000	This is just the night of random outbound phone calls
1626000	1628000	Is what it is
1628000	1630000	Let's call my mother next
1630000	1632000	We should have sent my mother to E3 wouldn't that have been fun
1632000	1634000	Yeah
1634000	1636000	Should be able to get in
1640000	1642000	Pick up the phone
1642000	1649600	gonna be all what's this number instead of the voicemail he's screaming no in
1649600	1660320	the chat room he's not answering I went to voicemail all right live radio he's
1660320	1668520	like my phone is in the other room oh he's running to fire out I'll try one
1668520	1677200	more time one more time everybody in the chat room is yelling at him this is the
1677200	1681520	best radio ever this is even funnier than sure me saying bless you in some
1681520	1686680	apparently he was playing it on medium and I misunderstood that hello okay lies
1686680	1691400	and slander I need to turn the radio down or else we're gonna have really bad
1691400	1696480	gecko okay we're fine sure okay hi hi hi tonight's the night of random phone
1696480	1701520	calls where I call people chatters you'll notice what so so then you tell me
1701520	1707340	about the Duke Nukem demo since I clearly misunderstood once you get to
1707340	1712200	the second part of the demo where you it shows you some vehicle play which is fun
1712200	1717600	and then you get out of your truck and the background is brown and the enemies
1717600	1722080	are brown so when they pop out I actually had a hard time seeing them and
1722080	1725320	because I was playing it on me and difficulty by the time I could get
1725320	1729600	behind cover I was dead already so I switched it too easy and then learned
1729600	1733320	where the spawns were and then switched back to medium and I was fine but yeah
1733320	1738120	it's it's I think there's some work that needs to be done on the clarity of the
1738120	1742600	the mobs especially since they don't they all kind of jump out from behind
1742600	1747700	things from out of nowhere so the game's gone gold now so whoops I don't know if
1747700	1754020	they're gonna fix that yeah I know right so yeah I didn't it feels like Duke they
1754020	1758640	definitely captured the humor and the attitude but as far as some amazing
1758640	1762400	first-person shooter like Bioshock which was a completely different experience
1762400	1766380	there's I don't think there's anything that remarkable about it it's pretty
1766380	1769800	much all fan service the fact that it exists it means that it's going to sell
1769800	1776280	but I don't think it's all that you know super amazing from the demo so do you
1776280	1781360	think you'll invest 50 bucks or whatever in the full version on Steam hell no I
1781360	1786680	don't care I don't care that badly that it's really kind of offensive and I mean
1786680	1790040	obviously it's a dude bro game with the you know blowjob in the opening scene
1790040	1796960	but I you know does the demo have multiplayer I don't think so hmm that's
1796960	1801520	too bad all right all right well thanks for letting me bug you don't be mad okay
1801520	1804480	but I want you I wanted you to be able to accurately represent and defend
1804480	1811480	yourself I would never want to get your opinions yes all right okay who should
1811480	1815840	we call next let's see okay no no we got a versus a show to do okay we got to get
1815840	1819280	into news that's it for our gaming weeks quick housekeeping again I just want to
1819280	1824640	clarify the schedule there will be no OLR next Sunday there will be two
1824640	1828360	episodes at well are on the feed this week Tuesday night Wednesday night join
1828360	1832680	us on our new you stream channel seven o'clock Pacific with special
1832680	1835920	correspondent Bobby black wolf here's the great news I don't think this really
1835920	1839240	affects anyone listening to this show but he's also gonna be posting the shows
1839240	1844040	on his feed which I think is really cool so that way if you I don't know why you
1844040	1846560	would be listening right now and you're not subscribed to our show but okay
1846560	1849200	let's say you're not you can also get them from Bobby's feed so they're gonna
1849200	1855480	be in both places for a maximum exposure I'm getting tweeted pictures by the way
1855480	1858920	right now from miklotov who I guess went to the convention center earlier and I
1858920	1861560	guess you know a couple days before the show you can just kind of walk right on
1861560	1866040	in there and walk around he's not in the actual exhibition halls but let's see
1866040	1872920	there's a giant ad for is Assassin's Creed revelations giant ad for that a
1872920	1877040	little picture of the lobby that shows nothing really notable can't really see
1877040	1880240	in the room there and they won't let him up the stairs I'm sure and then it looks
1880240	1884120	like what they're advertising on the entryway is rage which is supposed to
1884120	1887880	that big new shooter right which is gonna have a whole new engine that
1887880	1891760	people are going to adapt kind of like what unreal brought to the table and
1891760	1896120	there's these little gross little aliens crawling all over the entry plaza for
1896120	1900240	rage so you can expect that that game is going to have a big presence and three
1900240	1902840	so there you go
1902840	1908240	I know our next Sunday because dark soccer and I will be at Disneyland with
1908240	1911840	Bobby actually won't be there Sunday but we'll be driving back so and there will
1911840	1916000	be a damn there will be a damn there will be a damn Dan will be here for the
1916000	1920400	Tuesday Wednesday shows to us because Loki unfortunately will only be able to
1920400	1921840	join what I can do
1921840	1924880	he might try to pull some strings and join us live that would be amazing
1924880	1929840	we'll see what happens when may you can call me you know I can do it over Skype
1929840	1931120	or something like that
1931120	1935080	all right for at least like from eight o'clock on but we need at least the
1935080	1939040	Nintendo press conference feedback that's all that's yeah I agree Wednesday
1939040	1942840	maybe you know maybe not Wednesday but like Tuesday would be fun because then
1942840	1946200	that'd be after all the press conferences there you go
1946200	1950080	all right anyhow let's move on with gaming news because we got a lot to
1950080	1953840	cover tonight it's not just e3 but of course course e3 rumors are going to
1953840	1957640	start it come on so everybody's talking about let's start us off Loki
1957640	1963800	yes and I don't know I I think it's a dumb name but whatever
1964360	1969440	there's a rumor that the what's being you know codenamed NGP right now is
1969440	1975080	actually going to be officially revealed as the PlayStation Vita or the PS Vita
1975080	1978840	or vita vita could be either way
1978840	1984120	pens if they're going for vital or vitamin or vita pita
1985000	1993200	yes and so well here's here's what evidence they have for that one there
1993200	1998920	was a leaked or apparently leaked picture of a brochure showing the system
1998920	2004720	with the PS Vita image on there and you know where is most people might say oh
2004720	2008240	that may be photoshopped well there's least some other evidence to go along
2008240	2009240	with that
2009240	2014880	there's actually a few a few pictures of that so that's kind of interesting also
2014880	2024880	there's apparently there was like a domain for developers that actually had
2024880	2032440	a PS Vita for it's the Sony dev site they had that and then also there
2032440	2041520	apparently there's text for the PlayStation Vita hidden away in the code
2041520	2047320	for the e3 site for Sony so yeah I gotta say that that's probably true
2047960	2052720	you know if it's if it's hidden away in their code on their website and it's
2052720	2057280	also on their dev site and it's also in this brochure it's probably makes me
2057280	2060480	feel great about the security of Sony in the future by the way
2060480	2065280	um I also agree it's it's probably the right name it makes sense
2065280	2068560	I it's you know they're trying to go for that catchy thing
2069120	2076120	I also just the fact that do you guys remember last e3 everything got spoiled
2076120	2079280	every no or was it two years ago yes well by them
2079280	2083760	member with the end with the PSP go no not just that there was one year were
2083760	2086520	like every big announcement that they were going to make was spoiled and I
2086520	2090360	remember he got up on stage when he showed the trailer for Final Fantasy 14
2090360	2091480	it was been two years ago
2091480	2094880	he got up on stage to show the trailer for fantasy 14 everybody thought he was
2094880	2099280	he had fucked up and meant to say 13 to but no it was actually 14 and then he
2099280	2099800	goes
2099800	2105160	hey there's one we kept from you like I remember that vividly in my mind like
2105160	2107360	the rest of that press conference and spoiled
2107360	2110360	yeah I'm glad you kept that one from us
2111200	2115320	wish you'd kept it away from us forever you keep it a little bit longer
2115320	2119800	I'm some other cool information regarding the NGP or Vita
2119800	2123760	I guess we'll call the Vita it's going to be fully backwards compatible with
2123760	2126920	all PSP games that are on the PlayStation Network obviously it's not
2126920	2128560	gonna have a UMD drive
2128560	2133560	it will also offer a smoothing and dual analog support so for example you know
2133560	2139560	games like resistance retribution you know how they had the DualShock 3
2139560	2145200	controller support if you you played that with PlayStation or the PSP Go or
2145200	2153880	believe through your through the resistance like for the call that like
2153880	2157400	the infected mode or something like that it's basically where it linked up
2157400	2162080	with resistance to be playing through that you could also do DualShock 3
2162080	2166520	support but now it's going to support for all games because you know obviously
2166520	2170680	the new piece of hardware has tool you know dual analog sticks that's kind of
2170680	2171120	cool
2171120	2176240	I'm sorry I I'm late to the party and that's fine I'm actually waiting to hear
2176240	2180320	a lot of this from Sony's mouth tomorrow but on this thing doesn't have a UMD
2180320	2180880	drive
2180880	2185200	it doesn't have any that doesn't have any dry has it has to physical like SD
2185200	2188520	card proprietary some sort of storage card
2188520	2193880	ok ok so there's some I was like they didn't learn from the go that people
2193880	2196040	don't want to download no it's like a cartridge
2196040	2201480	ok but yeah the rule is that there is no onboard storage at all for this thing
2201480	2204600	you have to buy your own like memory cards or something like that but that
2204600	2209880	each game would have its own you know card and there be space on there for
2209880	2213920	download content with a tiger kalana term says they should have called it PS
2213920	2219440	vivo which is Spanish for live might be ok name I think I think it's just going
2219440	2223760	to be PSV is what's going to end up I think yeah PSV and I think it's vita for
2223760	2227960	this is vital in for you to have because it has everything you know and that's
2227960	2231760	that Sony's little tagline it only does everything and that's what you know and
2231760	2235800	to be fair it was the strength of the PSP is it online you've a clip it is
2235800	2237800	just like you know my own trees
2237800	2242560	yeah I I would believe vita it's gonna and I think it's vital this is a vital
2242560	2247120	it's vital for all gamers to have this I'm sticking with for clint that's how
2247120	2251720	anyone who buys will handle and apparently you know the they've been on
2251720	2255280	the record saying that they're gonna learn they've learned from the mistakes
2255280	2259000	with the PSP and they're going to make sure they don't make them again with the
2259000	2264920	the vita they're basically saying we wanted to our biggest mistake I would
2264920	2270640	say with the PSP was that we were just so happy to provide the ps2 gaming on
2270640	2275880	the go we kind of stop there is what we want to do with the NGP or fighter
2275880	2282000	besides the great graphics and CPU think on what the interface could put in to
2282000	2286160	make gameplay reality stand out I really stand out you know something that you
2286160	2292640	cannot even do on the ps3 and yeah that makes sense with the rear touch pin the
2292640	2297640	augmented reality stuff and touchscreen also but I think it's almost like too
2297640	2303320	much you know like they have like some games that are kind of showing off that
2303320	2309760	we're touching I don't know it's a little weird to me but we'll see and I
2309760	2315080	gotta be honest you know I was kind of you know I'm one to kind of buy every
2315080	2318240	console when it comes out and stuff but you know I'm probably actually not gonna
2318240	2321080	buy one of these and the reason why is they were shown off some of the games
2321080	2324880	that they have at launch or whatever they have a wipeout game and they have
2324880	2330560	course ridge racer they have uncharted no ridge racer and some others and some
2330560	2334520	other games like super stardust and stuff like that but I'm not a fan of
2334520	2339080	uncharted I don't really care about wipeout so it's to me it's almost like
2339080	2345000	hey look it's the 3ds lineup again no I'm not gonna do this you're not a fan
2345000	2349640	of uncharted bless from her alright I wouldn't look at the chat room here with
2349640	2354480	some of the comments about the name JV Mon in our charm says Vita equals life
2354480	2358600	PlayStation life like you live a PlayStation life actually isn't
2358600	2361320	PlayStation life the name of one of the channels like it's the one that no one
2361320	2365040	ever uses that had the well they used it at first it has the news and the folding
2365040	2370000	at home is that PlayStation life don't they call it that I don't know also
2370000	2374840	salacious pop in our charm says living la vida joca we knew that joke was
2374840	2382160	coming we knew that joke was coming moving on more rumors more things to
2382160	2386720	talk about this time about Microsoft and some of the things that apparently they
2386720	2392160	have coming and this news has to do with trademarks and other things that have
2392160	2393800	been spotted out in the wild
2393800	2398440	let's see fusion genesis is one of the trademarks that is shown up for
2398440	2405040	Microsoft and also fusion vault infusion sentiment they are specified in the
2405040	2409480	little trademark as entertainment services namely providing an online
2409480	2415080	computer game so there must be some type of fusion series coming out for either
2415080	2420320	xbox live arcade gotta be fusion frenzy I fucking hate no fusion frenzy that was
2420320	2425000	a Hudson thing anyway was never Microsoft centric and you know they
2425000	2429040	couldn't swap developers on you know Microsoft game okay but like if
2429040	2434200	Microsoft was gonna buy a franchise like fusion frenzy which I don't think I
2434200	2437200	mean I realize Hudson in the US kind of close but I believe they still have a
2437200	2442000	Japanese presence so well just because why would you buy the fusion frenzy
2442000	2446360	series that last game was awful and on top of that you know it's like Hudson
2446360	2451040	was responsible for the Mario Party games and those weren't terrible it's
2451040	2456880	just like for the 360 like or even the original xbox let's just not give a shit
2456880	2461080	on this problem with all due respect to people that work at Hudson the biggest
2461080	2464640	issue with Hudson is that they've had some really big hits and some huge
2464640	2470520	misses like just wow wow like bomber man zero was a Hudson game if I'm not
2470520	2475520	mistaken correct yeah yeah fusion frenzy too I think all bomber man games have
2475520	2481640	been Hudson because Hudson created bomber man correct but the arc now see
2481640	2485480	but when they hit they hit pretty well deca sports actually wasn't a bad game
2485480	2491280	it was pretty nice little expansion of Wii Sports I the bomber man xbox live
2491280	2495200	arcade thing was great for you know it was delivered exactly what people wanted
2495200	2499400	out of a bomber man game but anyway how did we get from fusion to bomber man
2499400	2503200	oh yeah that's because it's a fusion frenzy yeah you know the problem with
2503200	2507680	Hudson is their own by Tommy I wonder if it's not their answer to pixel junk
2507680	2510800	that's where my mind goes like it doesn't necessarily have to be like
2510800	2513840	they're gonna go why do they need to even answer that I mean seriously
2513840	2519360	because it's done well for so what so good a game is done well for Sony
2519360	2522680	why they need to answer that they have plenty of good games on xbox live
2522680	2526160	arcade hell there's good games coming out every week on xbox live arcade
2526160	2529840	versus the PlayStation Network which doesn't get everything you know each
2529840	2534960	week game guru in our chat says I think Microsoft owns the fusion frenzy license
2534960	2539240	ok fine but really I really don't think these games have any idea of fusion
2539240	2545080	crazy that last game killed the series let it let it die you know just I don't
2545080	2550960	think this is it I mean I I don't know they could be a connect thing with me I
2550960	2553800	think it's just gonna be minigame garbage unfortunately that's where my
2553800	2557720	mind goes but it's just a freaking name it could also be the best game we've
2557720	2560960	ever seen I mean we just don't know their names I'm gonna make the best game
2560960	2568520	ever and call freaking garbage and you play a garbage man that's what well no
2568520	2576040	ok case in point super meat boy hat I based on the name and the box art I was
2576040	2581480	like this game looks stupid this game looks so stupid and then I played it I'm
2581480	2586840	like oh my god schemes amazing so you know names do not mean everything anyway
2586840	2592400	let's get to some other speaking of names some other registrations domains
2592400	2596200	apparently some internet domain names that have been registered fabled the
2596200	2602280	journey new fable game or possible Xbox Live or possibly fable connect fable
2602280	2608760	connect this is what Milo turned into I'm thinking it's this all that whole
2608760	2612640	like you can have him set down in the stream and you can hold the pieces of
2612640	2616400	paper interacting with people fable the journey is what happened to Milo I know
2616400	2621560	I don't even think it's that far I think it's just fable with some connect you
2621560	2627840	know connectivity I guess I've abandoned no I've abandoned the whole fable series
2627840	2630520	anyway so the hell with I don't even care what it is
2630520	2635520	alright connect fun labs is another one that was already leaked though in an
2635520	2641840	earlier thing I dance central to which I mean really duh really connect sports
2641840	2647520	season two duh yeah also also pretty much a duh so the sequels to our two
2647520	2653160	most successful connect titles never exactly again it's it's really all about
2653160	2658920	okay what is the connect gonna give us that isn't part of the we I'm really
2658920	2662280	interested in what this whole connect Star Wars thing is that because remember
2662280	2666640	they if they had teased that last year and we got nothing well this is the year
2666640	2671920	we need to see what connects Star Wars is all about all LucasArts got you know
2671920	2675620	they have right now is just the Old Republic that's it they have nothing
2675620	2681680	else slated to come out that they have announced all right go going to our
2681680	2685200	chairman chat dot orange launch radio comm Randy and our charm says hold hands
2685200	2689520	and fable with connect what the hell was that hand-holding thing anyway like it
2689520	2693800	didn't make sense like just say follow me for well for escorting the girl and
2693800	2696260	stuff it made sense but did you really have to be able to hold hands and run
2696260	2704120	everybody through town it's just weird I go did it but I go she was I go all
2704120	2707360	right moving on what did the press conference has already happened right
2707360	2711920	dark soccer konami we had some announcements from konami we had the
2711920	2715920	Metal Gear Solid HD collection that has Metal Gear Solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3
2715920	2722680	snake eater and Metal Gear Solid peace Walker but the original one is not in it
2723960	2727880	Twin Snakes though I mean that was that should have been in there they've
2727880	2733040	already remade it once so but anyway it's going to be available on the ps3
2733040	2739880	and Xbox and will support 1080p and on the ps3 there is a transferring feature
2739880	2744480	well I guess transferring I should say it must have been misspelled no I think
2744480	2748800	they are misspelling it on purpose they're little trans firing yeah yeah
2748800	2753200	where you can transfer your peace Walker game from your PSP to your ps3 I know
2753200	2757920	like how they pronounce million Marion you can trance you can transfer your
2757920	2763120	game from the ps3 to the PSP there's also a zone of the enders HD collection
2763120	2767840	so that has one of the enders and some of the enders too and not much else is
2767840	2771960	said about that except that they're thinking it'll be out in 2012 and it'll
2771960	2780560	be a ps3 and Xbox 360 and it will also have trans firing much better but there
2780560	2786960	wasn't a zone of the enders game on the PSP I well more importantly than all of
2786960	2791800	that there's going to be a Silent Hill collection which is silent hill two and
2791800	2795600	three and it's just basically touched up to look good in HD and doesn't say
2795600	2799520	what's going to be on although my assumption would be well ps3 and Xbox
2799520	2804000	360 no maybe you can transfer to there too I don't know I'm gonna call it
2804000	2810080	trans fart so that I can think of pooting noises whenever you do your
2810080	2814080	trans farting well here's the thing the trans firing stuff the psycho mantis
2814080	2819120	read my trans farted data it's not really a good feature anyways because
2819120	2826080	the only game you can use that for would be the PSP port and peace Walker is the
2826080	2829280	only game and I'm assuming you have to have the original game for that as well
2829280	2836240	so I don't know that's kind of weird it does feel like a lot of wasted resources
2836240	2840560	on something no one's going to use correct yeah and what I would think
2840560	2845680	would be cool is that for those of us who have older ps3s it would be cool if
2845680	2848680	there you know could be some way to transfer your save file but other than
2848680	2856560	that you know that would be a pipe dream yeah I don't know did you guys watch
2856560	2861480	Konami's press conference out of curiosity no here's the thing I I did
2861480	2866400	watch most of it and what I thought was interesting most people were looking
2866400	2869960	forward to Konami's press conference this year because the last couple years
2869960	2874600	have just been an absolute fucking train wreck like it has just been like Konami
2874600	2877920	it's just like like you know and I've used this reference before on the show
2877920	2880640	but it's so true it's like the old episodes of the Ricky Lake show where
2880640	2884440	she's just got her hand against her like uh and her jaw drop like I can't even
2884440	2887880	control what's going on this stage right now is the show a hot mess yeah there
2887880	2890840	was the year that they showed rock revolution and they failed the song on
2890840	2894760	stage and then they had what last year the whole lucha libre thing wasn't that
2894760	2898200	part of their thing and like it was just like what in the hell is going on in the
2898200	2905160	hole what was it the one Marion troops and I I oh my god it was just it was
2905160	2909000	just like what fucking train wreck thing is gonna happen now like it's Oprah's
2909000	2915200	gonna come out and do bees everybody we got a game about bees hopefully you've
2915200	2918480	all seen that gift from the Conan show this is the best thing ever made anyway
2918480	2923440	um somebody in chat quick find me the Oprah bees gift because everybody needs
2923440	2926800	to see it because that's what we were expecting at the Konami press conference
2926800	2933000	this year was bees but no the whole thing was pre-recorded and it was a
2933000	2937920	pre-recorded slickly produced video reel it was very reminiscent of for those
2937920	2942040	that have seen the Konami booth at e3 they always have a giant television elite
2942040	2944840	well last year they remodeled it I can't remember if they have the giant TV
2944840	2947400	anymore but at least for the last few years before that they had a giant
2947400	2950200	television that would cycle through all the trailers and people kind of sit and
2950200	2954140	watch it was very reminiscent of this is the video that's gonna play on the giant
2954140	2961400	TV all e3 which is which I found it you know what hey it was a interesting way
2961400	2964640	for them to do it and you know they got their message out there and didn't
2964640	2968200	really get made fun of and there's been a lot of hypes for the products I found
2968200	2972440	it very interesting that they did it that way in part probably so that it was
2972440	2977440	very scripted and would not fall apart alright here's my complaint and besides
2977440	2981960	what Jamie's gonna talk about here in a second really is this all you've got
2981960	2986440	you've got remakes of your old shit I is that it this is what you've worked hard
2986440	2992640	on is well is taking assets from an old game and sprucing up sprucing up and hey
2992640	2995640	you know you're not really playing a new game we're just taking the old game hold
2995640	3000040	on hold on it up a bit and pumping it back into your console Kojima did come
3000040	3004600	out to talk about a new about his new engine for a game they has no game for
3004600	3009040	you know well here's the thing this is tricky though because maybe it's a game
3009040	3013800	they're going to announce but did because of this whole pre three thing
3013800	3017920	they didn't please just like you know they would announce it anyways if they
3017920	3023360	were going to have something to announce because I mean seriously where's a you
3023360	3027960	know no you're rising oh they mentioned that it's still coming to you next year
3027960	3032600	even though they mentioned it two years ago last year I guess yay thank you to
3032600	3036240	the four chatters that all found that at once for me the Oprah bees gift have you
3036240	3040720	seen it Loki I'm afraid I have not seen my favorite fucking thing ever wait hold
3040720	3045120	on oh there's a YouTube Ziba bless your heart
3049320	3052440	ultimate Oprah's ultimate favorite things here we go
3052440	3061580	nope I made a full screen here we go this is for you too they're opening the
3061580	3079120	box and bees and they're playing them I'm a bee in the background and this is
3079120	3091760	what we were expecting Konami's press conference this year was great I love
3091760	3094320	having a live chat room more than anything because they can find shit like
3094320	3098160	that for us on a whim and I don't care if it's a radio show and you can't see
3098160	3102480	the video this is about my amusement and Oprah bees amuses me I have more Silent
3102480	3107760	Hill me all right what well there was another announcement for a new Silent
3107760	3111880	Hill title and it's called book of memories and it's gonna be for the
3111880	3119240	vitamin the ps vitamin which is what I'm gonna call it the vitamin and they say
3119240	3124000	that is going to be exclusive to the vitamin and it will be released quote
3124000	3128120	later down the road after Silent Hill collection later down the road didn't
3128120	3133080	even say what fuck if we know it's coming someday so you didn't even
3133080	3139120	mention Silent Hill downpour at all they talked a little bit about dance dance
3139120	3144120	revolution hey we got an arcade machine that's coming to Japan oh good oh you
3144120	3147920	wanted something for you guys oh sorry we don't have anything for you we're
3147920	3151360	telling you this because we know you'll import it anyway we don't even have Glee
3151360	3157280	for you which is fine you know we don't care revolution Glee but I mean did they
3157280	3161480	announce some of that stuff kind of just in written form only like a new DDR game
3161480	3164520	is coming out to like it wasn't really in the video but they did put out a
3164520	3169080	little paper on it well you know I didn't see a DDR game on there I didn't
3169080	3175640	all I saw was you know x3 the arcade machine and that's it and yeah it's
3175640	3181840	coming out in Japan so that that does not count I'm afraid I'm sorry so really
3181840	3184960	what they're spending their time on doing is taking old shit and making it
3184960	3190480	new again or not even making a new making it prettier great good job you
3190480	3193240	know who can get away with that Sony can get away that cuz you know why cuz they
3193240	3198840	put out new shit on top of that I again you said they put out I think you I I
3198840	3202320	think it's too early to really say that because next week you know we have a new
3202320	3207240	Nintendo console coming out you know Konami is working on something as oh I'm
3207240	3213440	shaking waiting for the new elephants game it's gonna come out maybe it's okay
3213440	3216040	and maybe another deck of sports game because you know there'll be another
3216040	3221440	deck of sports game I'm done with you it's like deca sports and Ella bits
3221440	3226840	maybe and what other crap did they put out whenever there's a new console hmm
3226840	3231120	let me think here they don't put out Ella bits every time there's a new
3231120	3234960	console that happened once on the Wii yeah but they're gonna totally bring it
3234960	3240280	over you know it I don't think they will yeah that's right you just made sure me
3240280	3243160	leave the room that's guys believe that's another Hudson title too anyway
3243160	3247360	she's probably gonna go take a shit in the hall because of your outburst I'm
3247360	3251640	just thank you for making my cat poop all right can we move on with another
3251640	3259480	story please I guess I'm just saying it's it was not disappointing because I
3259480	3263160	kind of expect this little out of them you know I was hoping they would
3263160	3269760	surprise me but they might still know they're not come on this is Konami we're
3269760	3273000	talking about here they are never gonna surprise us they're gonna just come out
3273000	3276040	like almost want to bet money on this I'm doing the pie almost want to bet
3276040	3279600	money on this but I'm not going to because I'm broke and I'm going to
3279600	3283800	Disneyland this week and I need my money fine well just let's talk about
3283800	3287240	something else all right there's a rumor that Microsoft's gonna be announcing a
3287240	3293600	TV service at e3 basically kind of this whole rumor you know IP TV thing well
3293600	3297680	now they're gonna kind of take it a step further and basically become their own
3297680	3301560	you know service so instead of having you know dish or something like that you
3301560	3306120	could have you know whatever we're gonna call this believe Xbox Live diamond
3306120	3309400	they're saying is what's gonna be which is funny because I remember back in the
3309400	3315720	day having the diamond card which gave me nothing but didn't it give you like
3315720	3319160	discounts at Quiznos for like a month of something like that you know like I
3319160	3324000	never used I never upgrade of a section sub to a footlong that was what PS
3324000	3330560	diamonds those little like you know fundraising cards entertainment books
3330560	3333960	not even that not even the entertainment book but you know it's a little like
3333960	3338240	fundraising cards that you get that it's like oh this is for all the local
3338240	3343040	businesses you know 10% off of a you know a Subway sandwich or four square
3343040	3349200	well no not four square predating all of that I know I know it's hard to think of
3349200	3352720	a time that I wore square didn't exist all I can think of is the entertainment
3352720	3355920	books honestly there was the thing they'd sell them for like 35 bucks and
3355920	3359560	all it was like buy one get one free yeah those are sold those and banned
3359560	3365560	it's like I'm never gonna use all this I don't know um so before there was
3365560	3369880	Groupon there was entertainment books uh yes so they're saying that it's gonna be
3369880	3373240	for an additional monthly fee it's basically gonna be like a virtual cable
3373240	3381160	operator and yeah so not really too much that we know or if it's even gonna be
3381160	3384060	announced it would be kind of neat because honestly you know cables fucking
3384060	3389760	expensive so if I can get something decent for you know cheaper okay but
3389760	3394240	correct me if I wrong if net neutrality this whole thing about that the
3394240	3396920	websites will soon be able to block whatever the I'm sorry internet
3396920	3400380	providers will soon be able to be able to block whatever they want goes through
3400380	3404520	um do you think Comcast is gonna have this they'll just be like a block
3404520	3409720	unless Microsoft is somehow bought in to the providers and they kind of have done
3409720	3413640	this with ESPN like when you connect to the ESPN it shows in the corner when I
3413640	3416640	connect it says brought to you by Comcast like it knows what you're
3416640	3421640	connecting to them through it's possible so either there's gonna be an agreement
3421640	3428080	or this little TV network that they're doing might be their own set of channels
3428080	3433400	like it's not gonna be tied to regular TV I mean do you remember about a year
3433400	3438400	ago it had come out that before Conan signed the deal with TBS he had
3438400	3441960	entertained the notion about doing a weekly show or a nightly show on Xbox
3441960	3445640	Live have been awesome and that's why I think there's a lot of truth to this
3445640	3450520	because I think Microsoft's been trying to build this for some time and they
3450520	3454640	they have a similar service in UK although granted it's not their own
3454640	3457960	channel so I don't know I don't know where it's gonna fall I think I think
3457960	3464680	there absolutely will will be at least one new Microsoft channel in this and of
3464680	3472640	course MSNBC this is what does MS stand for in MSNBC so at least those two
3472640	3477320	channels but yeah I mean I don't if you get your cable internet through a cable
3477320	3481640	provider your cable providers gonna be pissed that this whole thing is going on
3481640	3485840	they'll try to stop it yeah and maybe even through nefarious purposes it'll be
3485840	3493680	it'll be about bandwidth caps and all that garbage so we'll see anyhow other
3493680	3499080	news about other things going on at e3 Q games is going to be showing three
3499080	3503600	titles at e3 please note that they are this is not the same thing as Q
3503600	3507960	entertainment I had actually made that mistake a little earlier on I thought
3507960	3511440	this is about Q entertainment no Q games is the company that makes like pixel
3511440	3515800	junk shooter and pixel they make all those games they are apparently they
3515800	3520360	have like a preview online for one other pixel junk game and it was a little bit
3520360	3524680	weird that title it was a pixel junk lifelike they had done a little preview
3524680	3530400	of that apparently they are going to do two unannounced projects at e3 could
3530400	3537120	they be more pixel junk games seems to be a lot of what they do now I bet one
3537120	3541200	of them will be but one of them might be something a little new maybe for another
3541200	3545760	console or something like that IDK but not the same as Q entertainment who
3545760	3551320	makes luminous and and you know it's a rez and all that child of eden mizuguchi
3551320	3558120	studio yeah different so there you go well we would move on to another story
3558120	3564040	of dark soccer left the studio so let me just yell at Loki some more what are you
3564040	3569840	yelling about how right I am but I was getting some dinner okay it's Dan made
3569840	3575600	pasta Alfredo anyway well how about some sim stuff although this is not the
3575600	3578960	cool type of sims news I wanted this actually makes me kind of sad but I'll
3578960	3582920	go ahead and tell everybody there's going to be a new standalone game on
3582920	3592440	Xbox 360 ps3 and the 3ds that is sims 3 pets and they said that it's going to be
3592440	3596320	a standard expansion on the PC and Mac but I don't know if it's gonna be as
3596320	3603280	awesome as what I'm hoping basically you can control your pets and you can breed
3603280	3608480	them and share them the Xbox 360 version will have Kinect capabilities you can
3608480	3615800	control the sims and their pets with voice commands and then he's like make
3615800	3621720	out and then they'll make out that type of thing but pets will for the 3ds will
3621720	3625460	have a pedometer so you get more karma points the more that you walk and you
3625460	3630520	can use it to buy in-game items and then with the street pass you can get pets to
3630520	3636080	other pets owners so there you go I'm just hoping that it I would rather that
3636080	3641600	for the PC one that it works a lot more like the old pets expansion did know you
3641600	3645280	have you can build your dog house and you can have your cat and you have to
3645280	3649680	clean up your cat's poo and that type of thing I'd make a big fat shirmy sounds
3649680	3655080	like fun well sims is for people who don't want to pay second life but you
3655080	3659520	know it's a lot more fun I don't know maybe they want to play second life by
3659520	3662720	themselves but like now I have to get generations if I want to play this one
3662720	3668600	it's RPM it's roleplay masturbation it's self-serving I'm kidding me the
3668600	3671960	odds of the Sims is what the still the best-selling PC game ever right pretty
3671960	3676960	much I don't even think Wow beat it so there you go all right let's travel the
3676960	3679680	world and look at some release dates if you don't want to get the Sims maybe
3679680	3683360	there's something else coming out to a store near you very soon this week
3683360	3687680	there's actually quite a few things coming out it's just kind of nice well

3729840	3733880	that well you got these games in a bunch of crap that's what's coming out this

3741080	3747960	garbage like that if you know that's your thing then cool what other garbage
3747960	3751280	do they have here Duke Nukem critical mass but that's not actually coming out
3751280	3754720	at that time Oh Green Lantern of course there's a movie tie-in game for that
3754720	3761240	which I'm sure it'll be just wonderful that's on PlayStation 3 we and Xbox 360
3761240	3766160	oh and DS and 3ds because that's a good 3ds title right there
3768000	3776240	oh yeah and then I forgot because this is actually about a week from today we
3776240	3780120	play motion will be coming out for Nintendo this is the innovative content
3780120	3781040	they have
3781040	3784600	oh hey we play sold really well let's make another one of those so that'll be
3784600	3793320	coming out from Nintendo with a black Wii U remote plus awesome that's it all
3793320	3796680	right moving on to Japanese release dates what's coming out over there on
3796680	3801320	the Xbox 360 on June 9th the Gears of War twin pack it's a platinum collection

3804200	3809720	Phantom Breaker in a limited edition red faction Armageddon and riot act 2 goes
3809720	3814360	into the platinum collection so that is also getting a price reduction riot act
3814360	3816640	2 is crackdown
3816640	3821240	what's their version of crackdown moving on to other consoles such as the
3821240	3828200	PlayStation 3 red faction Armageddon there as well real got to cool comes out
3828200	3833520	of the end is what that's called that is coming out on the ninth from Sega this
3833520	3835840	is a Yakuza zombie game
3835840	3839480	yeah that looks pretty cool could be interesting
3839480	3844880	are they bringing that over here I don't know it's not been announced yet so Yakuza
3844880	3847920	zombies maybe that's something you'll see any three next week localized
3847920	3854480	version of that on the Nintendo Wii nothing on the 3ds though fish on comes
3854480	3860560	out this week you guessed it it's a fishing game and it's 3d yay I would
3860560	3866400	have never guess it's a fishing game and lastly on the Sony PSP really not a lot
3866400	3872040	this week there's another even galleon limited edition thing it's a patchy game
3872040	3877240	trashy so I'm thinking that is what another Pachinko Evangelion game looking
3877240	3880720	at the screenshots another yeah it's like a little slot machine little
3880720	3884720	gambling games little mini games gambling slots that because there's a
3884720	3891440	revamped Evangelion series out so of course it's been getting big side
3891440	3896600	product reboot so there you go that's it does it for your Japanese releases in the
3896600	3901520	UK we have a few things we have on the 7th Super Street Fighter 4 arcade
3901520	3906560	edition and it will be out in the arcade Xbox 360 and ps3 on the 8th we have
3906560	3912240	Beyond Good and Evil HD and then on the 10th we have Arcana Hearts 3 infamous 2
3912240	3916680	Red Faction Armageddon White Knight Chronicles 2 and Duke Nukem forever
3916680	3927880	that's it forever and ever and stuff and ever did Loki just break in the song I
3927880	3931320	think you did a little bit I said never this is suddenly playing out like an
3931320	3938480	episode of Glee all right Loki so I almost made me gag on my food Rob thank
3938480	3944640	you tell me Loki what's going on what's going on what's going on as we have
3944640	3950200	rumors about the Wii successor this is stuff that we've all kind of heard about
3950200	3957560	before this is coming from Nikkei and this is basically the same publication
3957560	3963400	that also predicted the DSI to DSI excel the 3ds now they're predicting stuff for
3963400	3968440	the new Wii console or new Nintendo console apparently they are saying that
3968440	3973320	it's coming out on the let the second half of 2012 obviously fourth quarter
3973320	3979560	makes sense and that it will also have you the six inch touchscreen on the
3979560	3983440	controller yeah they are basically repeating what everybody else has been
3983440	3988040	saying and also apparently there is supposed to be having some sort of
3988040	3993480	camera on the actual controller as well they're saying that the company
3993480	3998520	omnivision who's working with Apple on its iPhone I'm supplying them with
3998520	4006160	cameras is also apparently supplying a Nintendo with cameras as well so
4006160	4013760	interesting that they're gonna do that and there was one other rumor that
4013760	4017880	didn't make our show roll because it was very very very last-minute but the
4017880	4027080	rumor is that Nintendo's next console might be called Nintendo that's right
4027080	4030800	that's how much effort they're putting into their console they don't even want
4030800	4034880	to fucking name it I you know what I actually don't think it's that terrible
4034880	4038400	the name I think there was a rumor that the Wii was gonna be called that that
4038400	4045080	it's just the Nintendo that whole reboot idea I I actually don't think it's a
4045080	4049440	terrible idea because you know if you go back to when all we had was the Nintendo
4049440	4053120	it was like hey you want to come over to my house and play Nintendo it was just
4053120	4059280	it became like a verb you know what I mean like Xeroxing Kleenex one of those
4059280	4065300	types of things so calling it the Nintendo Nintendo I don't think it's a
4065300	4071760	terrible name I could see like Nintendo HD or something like that I think most
4071760	4075080	people's reaction will be oh okay but I don't think you can say that's a bad
4075080	4081560	name if to be fair the original Nintendo was really called the Nintendo
4081560	4085520	Entertainment System yeah so if they're calling this just the Nintendo it is a
4085520	4092720	new name but I don't I actually don't believe it I I think because to call the
4092720	4096960	system your company when you're trying to also launch a 3ds thing side-by-side
4096960	4103080	I actually don't buy it I would I would give more credit to like Nintendo HD or
4103080	4111280	Nintendo with a very small suffix to it mm-hmm so let's see Randy in our term
4111280	4116160	says not Nintendo the Nintendo Rama says the next console called Nintendo I
4116160	4119520	fucking called that two weeks ago dude you gotta wait till Tuesday for you get
4119520	4124960	to parade that salacious pop to play Nintendo is still relevant vernacular in
4124960	4128440	my opinion so if they want to make a play on that it's not that surprising
4128440	4134520	that's kind of where I'm at my mom still calls it all Nintendo when I showed her
4134520	4137880	Mortal Kombat she was like oh you're gonna fire up the Nintendo okay maybe
4137880	4145480	not like that but you know she saw the same to her so we'll see anyhow one of
4145480	4148000	the story I want to get to you before we get to the classic game of the week and
4148000	4151520	this is important this has to do with of course fundraising efforts that are
4151520	4156080	still going on for Japanese tsunami relief guys it doesn't fix itself
4156080	4161080	overnight this fundraising effort is going to go on for years and years you
4161080	4165560	know again not to bring up really bad memories of the past but when hurricane
4165560	4170120	Katrina happened that took years to clean up and some would argue there's
4170120	4174600	still cleanup efforts that go on to this day so you know Japan is still in need
4174600	4178640	of help for tsunami relief and I think this is a great I love this gamers doing
4178640	4183320	good stuff stories play for Japan is going to be an album that is going to be
4183320	4187520	coming out we've talked about it a few times on the show before the track list
4187520	4191160	was announced this week that's the new news just going over some of the cool
4191160	4196000	things that are going to be on here there's original songs here a kiriyama
4196000	4201440	oka has a song called X on emo let's see Koji Kondo has a Super Mario medley on
4201440	4206600	two piano pianos meets uso Suzuki play for you
4206600	4211160	Tommy Tallarico greater lights so it's not just folks in Japan but it's Western
4211160	4217960	composers as well it's it's gonna be a great lineup so watch the the thing that
4217960	4222840	a kiriyama mocha was talking I did not watch the video I do have it here but
4222840	4227320	did you watch it yes it is what you think really good I mean what was in it
4227320	4232120	just talking about you know working with people from all over the world that
4232120	4236680	worked in the the industry specifically related to music and getting some of the
4236680	4239320	best things out there and that everything was going towards Japan relief
4239320	4242360	I mean it was it was really just thanking people involved and thinking
4242360	4246040	people to buy it and saying hey for all of you following us we recognize we have
4246040	4250240	a rolled a world audience and that type of thing awesome oh also how could I
4250240	4253480	forget no boo-wee Matsu has a new song every new morning you know no boo-wee
4253480	4258920	Matsu anyhow 100% of the proceeds from the play for Japan the album will go
4258920	4263160	straight to the Japanese Red Cross more information available play for Japan
4263160	4267720	org but I think this is great too it will be released in early June on the
4267720	4272240	iTunes store so I mean you know argue if you will if you hate Apple or whatever
4272240	4276240	but it is a huge store gonna be very easy and what I like about it is that I
4276240	4279520	remember a time three years ago it was very hard to find video game music on
4279520	4282280	iTunes now it seems like it's really broken through and it's pretty easy to
4282280	4286120	find a lot of the newer soundtracks on there so uh props to iTunes who
4286120	4289960	hopefully will be featuring that so that'll be available for sale again a
4289960	4292960	hundred percent of the proceeds going to the Japanese Red Cross play for Japan
4292960	4298520	org let's get into the classic game of the week every week here on the show
4298520	4303080	we'd like to highlight a game from gaming's past dark soccer likes to jump
4303080	4309800	into the vault and say hey look while you're talking about your newfangled
4309800	4316040	Nintendo's of the present I remember Nintendo's back in my day back when we
4316040	4323560	played awesome games such as this one yes bionic commando for the NES and I
4323560	4328160	could have gone over bionic commando the arcade version but I didn't because it's
4328160	4335120	not as great in Japan it was known as Hitler no Fuka Fukatsu top secret which
4335120	4341720	means the resurrection of Hitler top secret and it's kind of based off of the
4341720	4347640	87 bionic commando this one came out in 88 you basically have to explore
4347640	4353840	different stages and you play as lad Spencer who is going to rescue the guy
4353840	4361320	from the first game who was called Super Joe who was captured by the Empire you've
4361320	4367680	got to go stop the Empire of the the the general of the Imperial forces and who
4367680	4375280	is completing the project himself so you have to go and rescue Super Joe and lead
4375280	4382220	the FF battalion or double force battalion who were all commandos who use
4382220	4387560	wired guns rescue him so you've got a stage select map and you move around the
4387560	4393440	map screen and you can choose to move to different areas but you have to go back
4393440	4398760	and go through these overhead areas to get to different places there's 19 areas
4398760	4404560	in the game 1 through 12 or combat and 13 and 19 are all neutral areas where
4404560	4412100	you can't fight at all the if you fire your weapon at all in those areas you'll
4412100	4416640	be attacked by key peacekeeping force and but these are places where that you
4416640	4422180	can get information and items there's also green enemy trucks on the map
4422180	4426860	selection that will try to block your helicopter and if you fly into one of
4426860	4430220	these while you're traveling you have to battle the troops and this is the
4430220	4436940	overhead part oh it's like you know it's kind of like commando so you can
4436940	4442360	actually kill certain enemies to get additional continues so you've got a
4442360	4446840	bionic arm so you can't jump you just use the arm and you latch on and can
4446840	4454460	swing yourself at 45 degrees or you can go up or exactly right so you've got
4454460	4457880	different ways that you can move but it's really just those three ways you
4457880	4463280	can also use the arm to deflect some bullets and grab different enemies and
4463280	4469040	items and then you also get to communicate with your forces to get
4469040	4475000	information and you can tap into the enemy communication although sometimes
4475000	4480160	they will send a squadron to attack you if they detect you and sometimes you get
4480160	4485720	bullets from killing people because whenever I shoot somebody I get bullets
4485720	4493160	so at any rate there were clearly changes that were made to the game as
4493160	4497040	you can probably tell from the Japanese title the whole thing was basically
4497040	4504600	about fighting Nazis the Empire was like a neo-nazi nation and they used a
4504600	4511440	swastika for their logo so of course when it came out over here they changed
4511440	4515600	the logo and everything and they changed you know things to the Imperial forces
4515600	4521200	and blah blah although the end boss still looks like Hitler but they call
4521200	4528680	him master D like hi we kind of know who that is except you do get to see his
4528680	4534120	head explode which is pretty cool because he was a fuckhead yeah and I got
4534120	4537280	to say Tiger Claw in the charm says this is this game is from an era before the
4537280	4541080	ESRB so they were able to get away with some gore on an NES game that was just
4541080	4544320	because the ESRB that was Nintendo's own policy to get rid of the gore but yeah
4544320	4548400	heads exploding you didn't see that in many games no and it was a gory ass
4548400	4555360	explosion I mean it was like everywhere so yeah there have been other remakes
4555360	4561280	there was a portable version of bionic commando on the Gameboy in 1992 that was
4561280	4567720	based off of the NES game but it was turned into a futuristic one because
4567720	4574220	this was actually set in the 80s when it was made in the 80s and then there was
4574220	4579640	of course bionic commando rearmed that was developed by grin and it came out in
4579640	4585680	night in 2008 for PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and the sequel that came out
4585680	4592880	February 2011 and then the original NES bionic commando was featured on a game
4592880	4597560	boy advanced compilation is club Capcom classics mini mix which also included
4597560	4601960	Strider and mighty final fight two really good games well maybe not in a
4601960	4608680	strider but still so uh there's also a book a novel ization that was based off
4608680	4613200	of an S version so the main characters called Jack Marx and he lost his arm
4613200	4617380	when ninjas attacked his hotel room and kidnapped Super Joe so they replaced it
4617380	4621800	sounds like a Michael Bay movie no they replaced it with a bionic limb with a
4621800	4628720	grappling hook and other neato things so there's different things you know the
4628720	4633120	book was super toned down and they didn't kill anybody although certain
4633120	4641040	things like some of the deaths of Hal and kilt are kept in and they just sort
4641040	4645360	of skim over most of the stuff that goes on so they can fit the book and there's
4645360	4652000	an illustrated bionic commando story actually on a website that I will be
4652000	4657840	linking in the chat room and if you're not in a chat room oh well too bad so
4657840	4663600	here you can find out about Super Joe and about spencer alright there it is
4663600	4670360	your classic game of the week bionic commando for the NES not to be confused
4670360	4673640	with the arcade version or a Ziba keeps asking about in the chat room the
4673640	4677360	Commodore 64 version which I don't even remember playing but I'm pretty sure it
4677360	4681160	was based off the arcade more than was the NES speaking of which you did see
4681160	4686940	the magazine that I linked you right retro gamer oh yeah is doing a Commodore

4900360	4904120	tweets so you better get those in because we're almost done twitter.com
4904120	4907240	slash olr by the way speaking of Twitter I want to get a plug out for this
4907240	4912080	because Bobby is helping us with those e3 wrap-up shows he's gonna be telling
4912080	4916360	us he's gonna be helping us get interviews he's gonna be I mean they're
4916360	4920000	like mostly his shows probably think about it but no we'll be here given our
4920000	4924080	smart ass commentary but I do want to say about Bobby speaking of Twitter if
4924080	4927400	you're not following Bobby on Twitter you should be because he's kind of doing
4927400	4931520	he's he's biting an idea we did a couple years ago but with permission we told
4931520	4936640	me good that is you drive him on the show floor he is very minimal
4936640	4940440	appointments so if you're like Bobby I heard this game might be on the show
4940440	4945400	floor and nobody's covering it he'll go find out for you so all that stuff that
4945400	4949280	used to be in Kensha Hall that's now kind of sprinkled throughout the East
4949280	4953120	Halls and West Halls he'll go find that stuff for you I need to know what not to
4953120	4958320	miss putting out so there right now there's the first moon game but there's
4958320	4965120	seriously Twin Cities or Twin Town yes we we demand that Bobby goes to Natsume's
4965120	4971160	booth finds the largest chibi thing that they have on display in the booth and
4971160	4976000	get a picture with it it's harvest moon come on it's always harvest moon no one
4976000	4980280	year they had the the tulip game they were showing the game was great and it
4980280	4983600	always come out you run up and kiss people it did come out as a GameStop
4983600	4992560	exclusive but um I want I don't want a cow I want cow swag from the harvest moon
4992560	4998000	people I have like a pig from them I have a sheep somewhere have their pig
4998000	5008720	but I want a handsome I don't want a pig it's not kosher should I get on to rapid
5008720	5014880	fire news yes please sir okay resistance tool pack is coming out July 5th it is
5014880	5019720	basically resistance one and two for one low price plus you get a few extra skins
5019720	5026920	and why not you get a multiplayer skin that's the Capelli skin and also you're
5026920	5035160	also getting some maps as well the aftermath map pack in skin bundle with
5035160	5039560	the race skin multiplayer skin for resistance to offer 40 bucks you know I
5039560	5043400	actually may pick this up because I sold back resistance one a while ago and I
5043400	5047120	never really finished resistance to before I sold back and I'm really
5047120	5054640	looking forward to number three so I have to pick it up again pretty cool so
5054640	5058920	also this is kind of interesting because usually you hear about these type of
5058920	5063280	things when people are doing their own kind of portable console mods but they're
5063280	5069440	actually selling portable Dreamcast now these are not necessarily I think
5069440	5076120	official you know Dreamcast items actually sanctioned by Sega or something
5076120	5084400	but it's actually a portable system it's gonna go for 38,000 yen or you're
5084400	5092080	roughly four hundred and seventy dollars u.s. and that's kind of crazy it does
5092080	5097320	look something looks like something like Ben Heck would put out I mean very
5097320	5103720	vacuum formed shell and whatnot but uh yeah if you're really interested in
5103720	5107160	portable Dreamcast seriously you're better off building your own because it
5107160	5116120	be way cheaper way cheaper and then finally if you wanted to pick up the you
5116120	5120040	draw and you don't own a Wii you can now do that because it'll be coming on 360
5120040	5125520	and PlayStation 3 HD you draw HD you draw it's getting it's kind of some
5125520	5130680	enhancements it's going to be a multi-touch tablet it's going to have a
5130680	5136600	high-definition input 2,000 by 1600 resolution and you know you'll be able
5136600	5141880	to do the pinch and stretch rotation area HD it's a built-in tilt sensors now
5141880	5147480	you can draw penises in HD and what I of course will be coming with you draw
5147480	5151200	studio or it's in this case is going to be kind of a souped-up you draw studio
5151200	5155720	you draw studio instant artists with tutorials and a new interface and stuff
5155720	5159160	like that of course there's gonna be supporting the different you draw titles
5159160	5164200	like Pictionary and that kind of thing I don't know it's kind of interesting just
5164200	5170040	from what I've seen with you draw on the Wii the support ports kind of a because
5170040	5173160	it's only teach cute and stuff out and now I know that we heard rumors that
5173160	5176680	maybe Nintendo might put something out for you know everyone's hoping for Mario
5176680	5183600	Paint but I don't know that's that's a stretch I think but at least teach who's
5183600	5188360	supporting it they've got you know the Wii I want to say there's about five
5188360	5194320	games out for now so it's not bad Frisbee in our term says get a real tablet dark
5194320	5198720	Tetsuya says hey look at it this way the Bob Ross game lives on you can paint
5198720	5202000	happy little trees but let's be real they're all drawing penises with it by
5202000	5204520	the way one thing I forgot to mention about that Duke Nukem forever demo
5204520	5208800	there's a whiteboard in it that seems to exist for no other reason than for
5208800	5213640	twelve-year-olds to draw penises on it yep and then the the onlookers will
5213640	5218480	commentate oh that sounds like a good plan Duke you can draw a wiener on it
5218480	5223000	and I'm not talking about that was done in a video for the demo I guess it was
5223000	5226840	time to penis we have not asked that question in a very long time but
5226840	5230680	whenever there is a new peripheral announced you always have to ask the
5230680	5234400	question how long before someone either draws a dick on it or puts their dick
5234400	5241440	in it real you draw time to replace five seconds it'll be the first thing many
5241440	5248000	people draw that wiener I think it'd be cool though if they did you know but
5248000	5254320	they really need a new magic pen Jo game seriously that would be awesome break
5254320	5262720	man in our chat room says 3d vaginas are ugly yeah I saw Cloverfield to anything
5262720	5268120	else that's it oh hey then let's get to more news Michael J Fox is going to be
5268120	5271960	in the back to the future games yeah that's pretty cool because he wasn't in
5271960	5276240	the first few but they are going to bring him back for the fifth and I guess
5276240	5279240	the last game in the back to the future of course these are the telltale games
5279240	5284040	episodic now here's the thing they are not going to just simply replace AJ
5284040	5287880	Laskio who's been doing the voice and apparently doing a very good job Michael
5287880	5292440	J Fox is going to be in the conclusion the rumor is that he's one of McFly's
5292440	5296480	ancestors so yeah it's not a rumor that's actually they have video of it
5296480	5301360	okay so I guess the video came out between the story I'm reading and now so
5301360	5304600	yeah that's cool though that they've been able to work him in like that I
5304600	5307880	think that's really cool you know a lot of people been talking about that new
5307880	5312280	x-men movie and apparently it's really good it is I haven't seen it yet it's
5312280	5317480	really good it's way better than three three is poop three didn't happen this
5317480	5321500	movie is really good are there any good one-liners like do you know what
5321500	5325080	lightning what happens when lightning hits a toad no but my favorite line in
5325080	5328840	the whole movie is fuck off and you'll know what I'm talking about when you see
5328840	5332560	it all right you got it but here's the thing uh as far as the x-men goes the
5332560	5335960	reason why I bring it up and I forget why I bring it up why did I bring it up
5335960	5341180	oh yeah we were talking about Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were originally
5341180	5345560	supposed to have a cameo in it as I guess playing and you know the older
5345560	5348920	versions kind of like they did in the original x-men movie but they cut it or
5348920	5353080	they didn't film it and nixed it because they didn't want the new x-men movie
5353080	5356480	tied to the original at all but I thought that was kind of sad because
5356480	5360920	Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen like oh my god they could read the phone book
5360920	5364520	and I would just be like yes tell me more and they kind of epitomize the
5364520	5369240	characters that they played I mean they really did is professor Xavier of course
5369240	5372720	Patrick Stewart can play anybody and he would but I that person I hear the new
5372720	5377520	kids are really good too like just as younger versions they do a good job I
5377520	5381080	think they did a good job but but it's just like oh my god if somebody tried to
5381080	5385800	play a young captain Jean-Luc Picard like I don't think I'd ever be able to
5385800	5389640	believe it I tried to do that seriously he's right they did oh that's right
5389640	5395480	they did yeah seriously how fucking annoying is it that he picked Arnold
5395480	5399640	Schwarzenegger be mr. freeze over Patrick Stewart it would have been perfect oh
5399640	5403400	perfect give me started but no you know what it's a good thing Patrick Stewart
5403400	5406240	stayed away yeah you know what it would have killed him I mean seriously it
5406240	5411400	would've been real Julia all over again all right hey la noir which is a game
5411400	5415360	that Loki's loaning me I'm very excited I can take it out of my queue la noir
5415360	5418920	has got some download content that's gonna be coming out DLC is gonna come
5418920	5424080	what may 17th all the way through July 12th and there's DLC cases that you can
5424080	5427120	download one of them's called reefer madness I don't think it plays into the
5427120	5432720	movie but hey the naked city let's hope we see some more nude people yeah that's
5432720	5436040	coming out of May 31st for four bucks anyway if you want to buy all this stuff
5436040	5441960	a la carte you can pay $20 for it but you can also pre buy all of it for ten
5441960	5446480	bucks with what's called the rock star pass but you have until June 14th to
5446480	5450240	take advantage of that otherwise it's going up to twelve dollars after that so
5450240	5454840	there you go lots of stuff coming out that there's even I guess challenges a
5454840	5460240	new suits and guns and whatever horse armor but also some the social social
5460240	5468280	club things may 17th interesting stuff so la noir DLC speaking of download
5468280	5473600	stuff and all this stuff Capcom has reversed a decision we reported on no
5473600	5476560	actually we didn't report on this last week because I think we weren't here so
5476560	5479960	Capcom did take that DRM maybe this what I've seen you remember talking about it
5479960	5483640	so it was a couple weeks ago that this annoying DRM was going to be in Super
5483640	5486760	Street Fighter 4 on the PC that if you are not connected to the internet it
5486760	5491560	won't bork the game but you'll be limited to 15 fighters and of course
5491560	5496000	people raised hell on the forums and Capcom said okay okay we're back and
5496000	5500320	down yeah you we will be able to play as everybody even if not connected to the
5500320	5505360	internet however as one would logically as expect you won't have online
5505360	5509760	multiplayer replay sharing or watching and achievements unless you're online
5509760	5515600	and logged in which yeah that does make sense I think so there you go the
5515600	5522320	consumers win I think moving on we do have other news there is a Final Fantasy
5522320	5528800	5 rated by the ESRB for a PSN release in North America which is pretty good so

5579600	5583040	gets her own storyline she better not be played by Halle Berry she looks pretty
5583040	5586880	hot don't get me wrong Halle Berry is hot but that movie not hot no but she
5586880	5593240	looks pretty hot that's it nice all right let's get into what some Twitter
5593240	5597640	topics now yeah that's right twitter.com slash olr and every week you guys can
5597640	5602960	send us your tweets show us your tweets as we like to say and we read them as
5602960	5611200	long as they don't suck well let's start off Twitter this week with Oh Fiedelt61
5611200	5614160	tweeted us this and I don't think we actually covered this elsewhere on the
5614160	5619840	show trek movie.com reports that a video game set in the Star Trek movie universe
5619840	5623560	is coming in 2012 our soccer did you hear about this it seems right up your
5623560	5628840	alley Star Trek online it's gonna be set in the Abrams Trek universe I'm
5628840	5632240	assuming to maybe bridge the new movie because the new movies out next year too
5632240	5638480	right it is I thought they were targeting 2012 anyway well anyway it's
5638480	5642680	gonna be an original story an unprecedented co-op experience players
5642680	5649920	can play as Kirk and Spock so now you can be ZQ it's gonna be its own story
5649920	5653880	continues the adventure of the Star Trek movie the press release that was
5653880	5657480	released says that the game is filled with action-packed combat as Kirk and
5657480	5661960	Spock must work together to stop a legendary enemy race bent on conquering
5661960	5667800	the galaxy the story is being written by Mary Ann Kraswick she wrote for God of
5667800	5672460	War and she's a BAFTA Award winner and the writer producers of the new Star
5672460	5678640	Trek films so I imagine this will bridge things this is also the first full Star
5678640	5683920	Trek video game since 2007 they are not counting Star Trek online but they would
5683920	5689040	say that Star Trek conquest the game that came out from Bethesda because
5689040	5696360	that's what most people said about it it will be coming out in 2012 I I'll check
5696360	5702360	it out heck yeah I like Star Wars enough or Star Trek well I have an all tab open
5702360	5708800	with the Star Wars story that's coming later my bad Essex 22 tweeted us and
5708800	5714000	said just curious what you guys might consider the best downloadable co-op ps3
5714000	5718640	title want to find something a friend and I can play online any suggestions
5718640	5725360	best co-op downloadable title I would suggest on review I miss what's that
5725360	5729860	portal to you PC yeah I don't think you can download that though PC download it
5729860	5735520	for ps3 I would say Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light is a heck of a lot of
5735520	5738920	fun it's kind of like an arcade game but you could do the co-op mode that was fun
5738920	5742680	I had a lot of fun playing co-op in that that would be my suggestion assuming you
5742680	5746300	don't like already have it on 360 or steam I would definitely check out at
5746300	5749680	least the demo for the Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light I'm actually
5749680	5753840	really looking forward to that new Tomb Raider game I gotta say because you know
5753840	5757720	the the download title made me interested in Tomb Raider again and I
5757720	5760880	kind of like the direction they're going in with a new one the new trailers pretty
5760880	5765360	hot Loki I don't know if you mess around too much with co-op games online but
5765360	5771320	anything you can think of that might downloadable it's hard because I'm not
5771320	5777840	sure what type of games you really like and ps3 is also kind of limited with I
5777840	5781680	mean not as much stuff jumps to mind like they don't have quake 3 arena they
5781680	5784680	don't have in the kind of the same selection have perfect dark and some of
5784680	5789680	the same stuff that the Xbox does the pixel junk games are insanely popular I
5789680	5796200	would check those out too so things to think about more tweets coming to us
5796200	5802160	from the bacon bits tweeted us with something the Nintendo controller
5802160	5808480	spotted at e3 but then when I bring this up in a new window I'm like this is
5808480	5812360	somebody trying to be lolsy I think because what this is a picture of is I
5812360	5818720	think it's just an N 64 controller all taped up yeah somebody just posted an N
5818720	5823360	64 controller I think we'll see there although that would be kind of funny if
5823360	5827960	they just use the 64 controller all over again but I kind of doubt it
5827960	5832920	spasminator tweets us usual drill free TV shows on the PSN store also there's
5832920	5837280	free movie rentals too I gotta email him offline he's something about he set us
5837280	5844440	up an account that has like movies for me to watch like shit tons of anime
5844440	5848840	that's like what they have on the PlayStation Network store so that I've
5848840	5851800	been kinda inundated ever since PlayStation Network came back up which
5851800	5855320	by the way happened this week and has anyone tried to download the free games
5855320	5868840	because yeah I don't forget what did you download I downloaded Super Stardust HD
5868840	5880160	and I have infamous in my queue as well yes you get to p.s. 3 and 2 p.s. be nice
5880160	5885480	huh download some anyways yes you should take up the opportunity going to some
5885480	5890880	tweets from a blue swim her to LR play the opening song to Katamari Damacy on
5890880	5895680	the break and thought of retro force go orange on foodie a question what will
5895680	5900280	you be snacking on during the e3 pressers I'm gonna nom a bag of spicy
5900280	5906560	sweet chili Doritos popcorn yet me to kettle corn vegetables because we have a
5906560	5911560	bunch of them kettle corn specifically doing the Michael Jackson doing the
5911560	5918240	Michael Jackson thriller gift especially during a Sony suppressor and I will be
5918240	5923040	tweeting as well I can't wait to read your tweets I need that we need to look
5923040	5929120	into that cover it live software I don't even know if you could use that I know
5929120	5932240	you don't think it's a big deal but people people people love their Loki
5932240	5939440	rage it's just gonna be the problem is I have to watch them at work I have no
5939440	5943320	problem doing that because my boss is gone and his boss is gone so it's not
5943320	5947240	like it's not related to your job these are the games you're gonna be selling at
5947240	5951040	Christmas time I think you do have a right to watch this at work problem is
5951040	5958280	they let go so many people it's like I stupid Nazis don't let me know I'll just
5958280	5961960	lock the door what they're gonna do lock the door I'll lock the door to the
5961960	5965160	conference room we're gonna be watching on nice HGTV there you go
5965160	5970840	act deft tweets us what game or gaming related news would truly surprise you if
5970840	5974200	it happened on e3 this week now we are gonna get into e3 predictions a little
5974200	5977240	later but I'm gonna allow this question because it's not talking about what do
5977240	5981360	you think will happen this is talking about what would surprise you if it
5981360	5987560	happened is there anything that would truly surprise you if it happened Sony
5987560	5994040	doesn't fuck up that surprised me the f-zero game on the Nintendo console I
5994040	5998080	don't think it's gonna happen so I would say it would genuinely surprise me I
5998080	6003320	would be tickled pink when I go down there on Thursday to pick up Bobby I
6003320	6011080	might just have to rush the doors if the f-zero game happens there's not really
6011080	6015320	much that could be surprising to me I like so I'm going in the route to this
6015320	6021880	with really low expectations it's so hard to call things like that too
6021880	6026040	because when I think of like surprises I think of things that literally come the
6026040	6029800	fuck out of nowhere like I would say Gabe Newell getting up on stage at the
6029800	6034840	Sony press conference and saying hey by the way I don't hate Sony anymore and
6034840	6038120	we're gonna integrate steam in the PlayStation that was a fucking surprise
6038120	6043240	like and that I I couldn't have called that I don't think anyone could have and
6043240	6049040	Final Fantasy 14 as lolsy as that came up as that was two years ago let us not
6049040	6053160	forget when Jack Trenton was on stage and said we're gonna be delivering Final
6053160	6057480	Fantasy 14 everybody was like oh he just fucked up he meant 13 too and no it was
6057480	6061600	fucking 14 was coming out already even though really was 11 but you know yeah
6061600	6069040	11 HD surprises are so hard to foresee um I would say like a very strange
6069040	6074880	partnership especially from Microsoft and I know that's so vague I know the
6074880	6081560	return of Xbox live experience is like 1 versus 100 I sadly think that shit is
6081560	6085840	gone which pisses me off I think it was a great thing that they had but if if
6085840	6091480	they were to say hey we're bringing back the multiplayer game show type events
6091480	6095320	the live events on Xbox that would truly surprise me
6095320	6102680	where the fuck are my Burger King Kinect games Burger King Kinect part 2 that
6102680	6106840	would be your no they Burger King Kinect part 1 where the hell are they they
6106840	6111680	were they promised me that they're gonna have some exclusive Burger King King
6111680	6117440	Kinect games and I have yet to see these I was already the Bible because they
6117440	6121600	were gonna be terrible I know the Nintendo console projects imagery any
6121600	6124720	type of projector built into the Nintendo that would fucking surprise me
6124720	6130040	because that is not happening the holodeck the holidays holodeck announced
6130040	6133560	and it's coming to you from on live because nobody believed that shit would
6133560	6140760	work either and look there it is on life presents the holodeck alright I don't
6140760	6144720	want to miss these tweets from Tiger claw let me get to these top gun in days
6144720	6148440	of thunder to get blu-ray game slash movie combos did you hear about that
6148440	6151600	they're selling yeah I know packs I've been selling those have you really
6151600	6157240	known about that for a while and they sound lame it's no it's seriously it's
6157240	6159400	lame here's here's what they're doing they're doing basically what they did
6159400	6164160	with the Watchmen where they take the really shitty shitty PlayStation Network
6164160	6168460	games that sold like garbage and then they throw it in with the movie so
6168460	6171360	that's what you're gonna get you're gonna get the really shitty garbage top
6171360	6177240	gun game and the really terrible you know days of Thunder game awesome hey at
6177240	6181640	least you get a movie I gotta read this comment in chat guys you don't our
6181640	6185280	term says big brother on Xbox live arcade would be awesome if they don't
6185280	6188840	make it I will I've got to say this I was walking through Target and I saw
6188840	6195100	their Wii section of games and excuse me strawberry part um I saw for sale on the
6195100	6199320	Wii the survivor game that's now available on the Wii and look I'm a fan
6199320	6202600	of reality trash TV and I do watch almost every episode survivor stuff and
6202600	6206580	I picked up this box I just started laughing at how horrible this game
6206580	6210720	looked now have you seen the amazing race for the week I've heard that's
6210720	6216360	garbage too oh I'm sure it is but I mean like actually a survivor game or
6216360	6220560	something like that on Xbox live arcade in the party thing or whatever might not
6220560	6224720	suck if they do it right it could actually be really fucking interesting
6224720	6229740	but I just don't trust anyone to get it right because I look at this stuff
6229740	6234480	that's on the Wii and I'm like oh the Wii game shows that work best are the
6234480	6240040	minimalist ones like Wheel of Fortune that's pretty hard to fuck up jeopardy
6240040	6245800	again pretty hard to fuck up pressure luck no whammies no whammies stop I mean
6245800	6248760	somehow game show network fucked it up when they revived it but you know what I
6248760	6255000	mean classic pressure luck is still gold anyhow also from Tiger Claw penny arcade
6255000	6259880	comic to be adapted into a movie I had not heard about this have you heard
6259880	6263960	anything about this yeah it's a spin-off it's just basically what else is the
6263960	6268040	games didn't work out so well no it's not even a spin it's it's like a little
6268040	6273720	three panel comic that they did the story of the Divx player no it's not
6273720	6277160	even it's none of the penny arcade characters it's basically this kid who
6277160	6282000	is the new kid the new kid yeah he's moving it you know normally it's moving
6282000	6285040	to a new town well it's moving to a new planet and the planet has three-quarters
6285040	6289020	of the gravity that you know they had on earth or whatever and so I'm guessing
6289020	6292360	he's kind of like you know super strong and fast or whatever because you know
6292360	6296200	you would be if you went to a planet with less gravity well the guys but
6296200	6299840	everyone else would too you know no no if they grew up on that planet though
6299840	6303240	it'd be they wouldn't be super strong or fast or whatever they would be adapted
6303240	6307040	to that gravity where it's like it'd be just like you know for example if you
6307040	6309820	had leg weights and you're running with leg weights all the time you take them
6309820	6314200	off and they'll sudden you know you feel your logic there yeah I would question
6314200	6317040	how much are the penny arcade people gonna actually be involved in this
6317040	6320280	because they are pretty good writers and they write some really funny hilarious
6320280	6323400	insightful comments and they their commentary on gaming culture has always
6323400	6327320	been really good but then I read in this story here Paramount has tapped Gary
6327320	6331640	Witte a former PC gamer editor-in-chief and book of Eli screenwriter to pen the
6331640	6334660	new kid and I roll my eyes this has nothing to do with the penny arcade
6334660	6338680	comic it just it happens to be this is a comic that they also made okay none of
6338680	6341540	the characters are in it now the funny stuffs in I get that but I'm saying the
6341540	6344440	penny arcade comic proves that they're good writers and I would like to see
6344440	6349080	what they it's just like okay the South Park you know Trey and Matt are fucking
6349080	6352720	hilarious I want to see the Book of Mormon play on that alone like it has
6352720	6356560	nothing to do and I realized that that universe the South Park have nothing in
6356560	6361320	common except recurring Mormon jokes over and over but I want to see that
6361320	6364440	play based on the fact that I appreciate their work on the show and I think
6364440	6367880	they're very good satirists that's what I'm getting at does that make sense
6367880	6371820	oh all right and how that does it for tweets tonight twitter.com slash olr
6371820	6375600	send us more tweets for next week or send your tweets over to Bobby because
6375600	6381600	he's gonna be roaming the halls of e3 and he is your little eyebo that you can
6381600	6385560	command to go look at things and by the way he did accept the challenge of going
6385560	6389480	to find the giant stuffed animal at the Natsume booth and he will get chibi
6389480	6395200	wolf and a cow by the way you're not getting in the car to Disneyland without
6395200	6403960	swag for dark Sakura and sky probably Dan too no just for me all right let's
6403960	6408360	I'm giving him such a hard time all right let's move on more news plenty
6408360	6412600	more news and the mailbag and our e3 predictions just around the corner yes
6412600	6419240	so Activision not to lose out on a money-making opportunity they have
6419240	6425160	decided to create Call of Duty elite it is a paid digital platform being created
6425160	6431760	by beachhead studios built around right now modern warfare 3 and now the service
6431760	6437320	does have free aspects to it and this would include also like you know you
6437320	6444320	know guild making and you know you know sharing videos and that kind of stuff it
6444320	6448400	also you know tracks your stats you know very think of it like the halo waypoint
6448400	6455920	almost a little bit they have of course I guess they're saying part of the fee
6455920	6461320	will go towards a customer service operation that needs I guess that their
6461320	6464200	supporting the back and forth so they're saying you know it's gonna have a small
6464200	6470760	monthly fee and maybe like eight bucks or something and I don't know it just it
6470760	6476560	sounds interesting I guess you know especially since you know a lot of the
6476560	6480840	players for Call of Duty are really just online heavy it's really community
6480840	6484660	driven so it makes sense that they would be doing something like this also it's a
6484660	6488000	way for them to sell more you know subscriptions and make money and what
6488000	6491680	not make every month off of World of Warcraft from Blizzard how could we make
6491680	6497360	money every month offer other big games yeah why bother having them you know
6497360	6503920	share videos on YouTube for free when they can do it on our service and we
6503920	6508360	could just take down all the videos on YouTube well I don't think they would do
6508360	6512200	that but and I think a lot of its you know still free but they have like a
6512200	6515880	video out there that you can check out that has kind of some of the you know
6515880	6521080	features of it and stuff it sounds a little bit also I don't know if anyone
6521080	6526680	remembers because it's been around for at least a few months now since Medal of
6526680	6534120	Honor but remember there's also the EA's gun club or whatever so they've got you
6534120	6540880	know that kind of thing as well going on on the EA side so yeah I guess I don't
6540880	6543240	know it makes sense that they're kind of doing this sort of stuff and I'm sure
6543240	6546960	they're gonna have like you know betas for you know paid members and stuff like
6546960	6550040	that just a way to get people it kind of think of it like the PlayStation Plus
6550040	6555800	program or something like that I don't know if you're hardcore that it's worth
6555800	6559560	it to you well even for those of us that don't get it quote unquote we just go
6559560	6564760	lol more money well even if you don't like for example if you're not that
6564760	6570640	hardcore into it though you know you can at least get some stuff out of the you
6570640	6575400	know the free free portion of it like they haven't you like your career stats
6575400	6579640	or all that stuff if you like the stat tracking and I think they even have the
6579640	6584440	the hot points on the map and stuff where most of the players are you know
6584440	6589360	converging on and stuff like that so I don't know it check out the free portion
6589360	6594480	if you if it's not for you then you don't have to do it it's simple as that
6594480	6598840	you know we were talking a lot on Horde house today about $25 amounts and Wow
6598840	6603440	and why people buy them and you know it some of us look at it and go why in the
6603440	6606280	hell would you spend that money on them out but for some people it's like pretty
6606280	6612520	Barbie you know so you can't it's your money spending on whatever you want hey

6639600	6644520	for 30 days I'm sure that will be fantastic in 3d I'm sure it will fully
6644520	6650120	utilize the power of the 3ds goddamn NES game which is the the layers that's what
6650120	6654160	those layers NES games are gonna do it this like the background is one layer
6654160	6658920	and the sprites are a front layer and it's all in effect that's it but you
6658920	6662320	know there are a lot of people will pick it up and play it and go oh but I will
6662320	6665640	download it because it's free yeah it's free but I think I'm buying any of your
6665640	6670840	other fucking games other NES games and you know spinning unfortunately it
6670840	6673880	doesn't have internet play plus how are they gonna work that out did wasn't the
6673880	6678040	original excite bike kind of borked because there was a load save mode they
6678040	6681580	could fix that we get the original excite bike was a disc game and then
6681580	6684800	when they put it on the cartridge like it just flat-out didn't work when they
6684800	6689480	really fix that I thought when they even came the virtual console though maybe I
6689480	6692980	can't remember maybe somebody in chat this is why we have a live chat room
6692980	6695320	somebody will jump in here in a moment but anyway let me give you some more
6695320	6700680	details excite bike 3d classic will be free you want after 30 days you know how
6700680	6704440	much that was such a back six bucks that's retard well that's a bunch of
6704440	6710120	tacos well it's the five dollar NES game plus a dollar premium which is
6710120	6715400	interesting that's not we points that's 599 it sounds like they're walking away
6715400	6719520	from we points that that's that's right because it was so hard to calculate we
6719520	6725400	points based on the one-to-one ratio that they had their 500 we points that's
6725400	6732840	five dollars also Game Boy ports Super Mario Land alleyway and radar mission
6732840	6738680	will all be out on day one DSI and DSI XL owners will be able to transfer most
6738680	6742440	of the DSI where purchases to the system there are some things that are not going
6742440	6746320	to be transferable I believe all of it has to do with like license things like
6746320	6749640	the Domo Coon games don't transfer over because they probably weren't licensed
6749640	6753080	for more than they came out over here I I didn't know they did either it might
6753080	6757640	only be a Japanese thing IDK well DSI where I obviously I'd never really
6757640	6760520	downloaded any DSI were so hold on though this is huge
6760520	6766440	pokey decks 3d a virtual compendium of Pokemon from black and white it is a
6766440	6771800	free download it will allow you to just look up all the information in the world
6771800	6778360	on the Pokemon 3d models StreetPass functionality you unlock random Pokemon
6778360	6781200	by exchanging data I don't know if that ties in the black why I don't think it
6781200	6786240	does it's something to do with the pokey decks and QR code support you take a
6786240	6790800	picture of your friend set it as a background layer snap a picture of a QR
6790800	6798120	code to introduce a Pokemon like what whatever I think it's also got the AR
6798120	6802480	cards or whatever support so you can do the 3d models whatever I got to admit it
6802480	6807440	sounds I just can't wait for all the fucking mudkips because you know it's
6807440	6812880	just a matter of time before we get you know Oprah introducing mudkips uh let's

6870040	6874080	games on the 3ds so there you go all those announcements out now so they
6874080	6877080	don't have to talk about it at the press conference because they will be spending
6877080	6880880	all of their time undoubtedly talking about not just the new console but I'm
6880880	6885240	sure they will first parade out skyward sword for an update they'll parade out
6885240	6890320	3ds titles including the Mario title and maybe some surprises there on the 3ds
6890320	6898120	and then easily half to two-thirds will be about whatever this cafe thing is

6909320	6914800	Pokemon all right forget it well how about some other news for
6914800	6922680	Nintendo the the DS light actually will have actually today has a price
6922680	6928160	reduction it's gone down to $99 sucks for all you the bought one yesterday
6928160	6936780	yep but I guess they're just trying to clear out inventory who knows but the
6936780	6943160	games are still the games there's not getting a price reduction pro tip I saw
6943160	6946040	them foursquare I know you stopped using foursquare but there is a pretty good
6946040	6950880	deal on it still check into Toys R Us and you get buy one get one half off on
6950880	6958760	DS and 3ds titles pro tip okay I'm which I don't think I got into it on this show
6958760	6962840	I was talking about it more on the Bobby call at the end of his show but I'm
6962840	6966040	convinced whatever this Nintendo controller is their little touch screen
6966040	6969640	thing I was saying on Bobby show you know Nintendo has been making touch
6969640	6973800	screens controllers for about five six years now it's called the DS and the
6973800	6977260	bottom half of that that's gonna be your controller it's a touchscreen with
6977260	6982680	buttons you've had one all along it would be amazing if the DS would just
6982680	6988760	work as a controller but let's not let's there'll be a special new button or
6988760	6991440	there'll be something extra on this thing Rob
6991440	7000800	all right moving on Loki freestyle games I may remember them from such series as
7000800	7009320	DJ hero well thankfully they are not dead which is good apparently though I
7009320	7015640	guess they have confirmed 35 positions will be lost but they still have a
7015640	7019820	strong partnership with Activision and they're currently working on a new
7019820	7024880	innovative unannounced project and it says of course they plan to share
7024880	7030360	details about those project or the said project in the next coming months it's
7030360	7032960	good to see that they're still around hopefully we'll get Lisa DJ hero 3 out
7032960	7037960	of them yeah that would be cool I would appreciate that Rama's correcting me on
7037960	7041680	something in the chat room nope you get your money back if there's a price drop
7041680	7045440	within two weeks of purchase you get the difference back well now that really
7045440	7049240	depends on what story you buy it at but okay fine I'll play your game here and
7049240	7056880	say sucks for those that bought it 15 days ago why are you buying a DS now I
7056880	7062240	mean seriously buy something else the 3ds will slowly add value before
7062240	7065520	Christmas before Christmas you're gonna see and there will be time like you're
7065520	7070160	gonna probably see the Netflix on 3ds in action and some of this at the
7070160	7074440	conference and all this so I think the 3ds is gonna see a lot more added value
7074440	7078700	before Christmas time it's just us early adopters we got Street Fighter pilot
7078700	7086120	wings Ridge Racer IDK steel diver that's Zelda oh yeah Zelda yeah a game we
7086120	7092320	played 10 years ago it was overrated then alright love of God publisher stop
7092320	7100000	making your old games making an old game HD is not a fucking new game okay who
7100000	7104760	remembers a company called origin do you remember this company origin I believe
7104760	7109000	they didn't have the ultimate games back in the day yes the only origin I know of
7109000	7113680	is the ones that as the cosmetic company yeah well origin yeah they did the
7113680	7118960	ultimate games which is huge get this EA but origin system some time ago it was
7118960	7121720	like 20 years ago they bought it was a long time ago they're bringing back the
7121720	7127360	brand so to speak or at least the name with a direct to consumer gaming
7127360	7134080	platform here it is it's an EA store it's basically a competitor to steam EA
7134080	7139240	has launched the service and more than 150 games are already available on the
7139240	7143600	service it's also gonna have exclusive limited edition stuff like battle
7143600	7150000	field 3 Alice madness returns kingdoms of Amalur Star Wars the Old Republic is
7150000	7154760	supposedly going to be downloadable only on origin origin will have its own
7154760	7159000	application which you can find connect with friends blah blah blah download
7159000	7161880	play PC games basically they're doing everything that seems doing trying to
7161880	7165920	get a little more competition in space because let's face it the games for
7165920	7170560	Windows live thing really hasn't you know just broke through like I think
7170560	7174640	Microsoft is hoping it would apparently the service is also going to work on
7174640	7179800	mobile devices Scrabble mobile versions of battlefield 3 all of that will be on
7179800	7186400	the origin store as well speaking of Ultima randomly I did read an article
7186400	7190320	that Ultima 4 is now like free-to-play online so if you want to go back and
7190320	7195320	play like a classic RPG that will just it's as hard to it's it's just really a
7195320	7199720	difficult title the NES version really dumped it up and it still was really
7199720	7205520	hard I would check out Ultima 4 that's what RPGs were when I was a kid and we
7205520	7210080	liked it more information I'm sure at EA's press
7210080	7217080	conference which is at 1230 Pacific 330 Eastern on Monday on right now is the
7217080	7221920	orange lounge radio mailbag every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at
7221920	7226440	orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer will dive in pick a few of her favorites
7226440	7231160	and read them right now on the air well we got a bunch so I'm only gonna read
7231160	7234500	four and I picked them at random and I didn't pick any that were by the same
7234500	7239000	person okay so that was my criteria so if you're not getting read don't worry
7239000	7243120	I probably and you shouldn't get butthurt if you're not getting read I
7243120	7246720	mean I don't want to sound like we have ego here but we do have a nice
7246720	7250220	listenership we appreciate everybody that listens but when you all email us
7250220	7253340	at once we can't read it all or it would be a seven-hour show it's nothing
7253340	7257780	personal yes I would like to say that if you've got something to send us just do
7257780	7262800	it in one email I don't care if it's really long I would prefer the one email
7262800	7268200	so this one comes from Holly exactly how stupid is this guy who complained about
7268200	7271820	it and it's actually about the portal to being offended offending seriously
7271820	7275800	GLaDOS is the villain Wheatley is the villain they're supposed to make you
7275800	7280480	feel bad and insult you my husband is 200 pounds overweight and he found the
7280480	7284760	fat jokes absolutely hilarious why because they are villains how thick in
7284760	7287600	the head do you have to be to think that the game is offensive because the villain
7287600	7292000	insults people more to the point she does it in the first game so you're
7292000	7294940	telling me that the moron bought the first game heard it ignored it and then
7294940	7300500	decided to be offended the second game you know I I know why okay you know I
7300500	7303480	know why there wasn't a rapture on Saturday God look down at the world and
7303480	7313840	facepalmed I think to a god this was a ugly story last week but yeah I mean
7313840	7320280	GLaDOS was very you couldn't take GLaDOS seriously you know what I mean
7320280	7324760	like the way the character was built and Wheatley was designed to be the dumbest
7324760	7330320	moron that ever lived end quote to me that whole thing was just sensationalist
7330320	7334360	media and it's just unfortunate like yeah people are gonna get offended but
7334360	7339880	you know what we all get offended they were completely the the news quote
7339880	7344120	professionals did they ever respond to you by the way no of course not highly
7344120	7350600	unprofessional mm-hmm don't believe anything that they say more emails this
7350600	7354320	one comes through the website just wanted to get your opinions on some
7354320	7356880	things what did you think of the original gold my double-oh-seven and
7356880	7361040	perfect dark I myself enjoy these games quite a bit because I'm a big fan of
7361040	7367280	first-person shooters keep up the good work sincerely CD Thunder well um they
7367280	7371760	both made me throw up not because they were bad they were bad at all golden I
7371760	7376800	was really great but I've told the story before when I first moved out here and
7376800	7381240	lived with Dan he had a Nintendo 64 play golden I mm-hmm and I would end up
7381240	7385520	rolling over on the couch and staring at the back of the couch because I was so
7385520	7390920	nauseous that I could not watch him play so I would listen to him play golden I
7390920	7394720	was simply a landmark title like it just it did so much for first-person shooters
7394720	7398280	that's what that's why they tried to imitate it on the Wii and try to hit
7398280	7402800	gold twice but it kind of you know it just wasn't the same you know and that's
7402800	7405600	the unfortunate thing with a lot of these retro updates it's just not the
7405600	7409280	same well the first golden I came at what 15 years ago no not that long well
7409280	7413960	whenever the movie was out it was late night well yeah so I guess it's the
7413960	7420320	difference between you know trying to capture that same it's like movie remakes
7420320	7429120	now you just can't capture the same joy now perfect dark perfect dark the 361
7429120	7432640	that was a launch title I didn't care for it all but the original perfect dark
7432640	7439600	was pretty awesome and it's fun to play on Xbox Live now just just saying well
7439600	7445120	we got another one through the website this is from Cal Roo I understand that
7445120	7447920	the news is trying to blame the game okay this is probably more about the
7447920	7452240	portal thing I understand that the news is trying to blame the game for poor
7452240	7454600	dialogue and dark soccer was blaming the news channel for their poor
7454600	7458280	investigation but neither of you guys really looked at the real issue and that
7458280	7463240	is the rating the this person is using such a horrible gram there's no
7463240	7469200	punctuation in here there's none but one ellipse okay anyway so the game was
7469200	7473560	rated e 10 plus and should have been rated T so a lot of the concepts in the
7473560	7476720	game seemed to be a little over the head of the ten-year-old so let's stop
7476720	7481320	blaming games and blame the rating system well yeah the rating system is
7481320	7488400	shit anyway but I knew what adoption was when I was 10 I didn't you know it
7488400	7493360	doesn't matter I actually think the emailer has a wee bit of a point but at
7493360	7497920	the same time it's no rating boards responsibility to fill the role of a
7497920	7503920	parent and I don't know it's it's it's it's a really tough call like I get this
7503920	7508400	perspective a lot like even though you might have known what it was when you
7508400	7512880	were 10 I can see where maybe there wasn't enough warning that hey there
7512880	7516200	might be some jokes that are gonna go over a 10 years old 10 year olds head
7516200	7519800	and maybe this game really should be only played by teens and up like I gotta
7519800	7524720	be honest would I let my kid play portal I would yeah I don't think it's really
7524720	7528400	dangerous but that's but then again I don't have these sensitivities to watch
7528400	7533480	out for I got a baby to stop crying by playing portal to seriously dance cousin
7533480	7537080	was over here and her baby was crying in her lap so I asked if I could hold him
7537080	7540600	and then I held him while I was playing portal to in my lap and he thought it
7540600	7544040	was amazing let me put it this way as far as his email goes it's a fair
7544040	7548640	argument I'm just not sure I agree but I think this is a it's a valid counter
7548640	7552880	point I'll give you that I can see it I mean I honestly think that they should
7552880	7555800	just rate them the way they do movies mm-hmm then people would get it because
7555800	7560880	apparently I honestly think that a lot of people especially ones who are not
7560880	7567480	gamers and that our parents now don't want to understand it they want other
7567480	7572160	people to do their thinking for them and that's not acceptable so honestly if
7572160	7574320	you've got to answer a difficult question because you didn't do any
7574320	7577280	research into the game guess what that's on you
7577280	7583160	tricky-tricky is there more to the email or is that okay one more yeah one more
7583160	7589200	another one through the website I was picking the short ones okay a few shows
7589200	7593800	ago you picked you picked this this is towards me all a few shows ago you
7593800	7596840	picked up this old game called phantasmagoria I remember playing it when
7596840	7600480	I was 15 and absolutely loved it soon after that I played Gabriel Knight the
7600480	7604640	beast within after thinking back of those games I started to wonder if there
7604640	7608520	are any recent games out there that are point-click horrors all I've seen so far
7608520	7612120	are mysteries and unfortunately it's more aimed at children I want my horror
7612120	7616120	and gore sad face toodles sill I love sill yeah
7616120	7621680	stills still lived in amps they I don't know if she was in the capital of Holland
7621680	7627240	but she was in Dutch country and then she moved to Britain not that long ago
7627240	7630880	she's not in London but she's you know in another part of the country and yeah
7630880	7633520	we had her own a hoard house couple weeks ago she hosts the girls gone Wow
7633520	7639520	podcast which is a lot of fun you should go on that show except at the time they
7639520	7644280	tape it's probably like 3 a.m. if they do it on a weekend and I don't have
7644280	7650080	school the next day but anyway back to the question itself phantasmagoria yeah
7650080	7652720	there really hasn't been a game like that a long time there was the Silent
7652720	7656240	Hill game only was kind of point-and-click II but not quite yeah I
7656240	7658760	mean there's there's one extreme of the other I know what she's talking which
7658760	7661680	talk about the Nancy Drew games are kind of like those mystery games that they're
7661680	7665680	kind of kitty they still have those coming on we oh yeah those well and they
7665680	7670880	still come out on PC as well those things still sell pretty well um as well
7670880	7674720	for what they are I'm gonna do a quick bit of research on uh but yeah I mean if
7674720	7678080	you want to go to the console side I mean Silent Hill games still have you
7678080	7682400	know the gore and the fun stuff and not just Silent Hill but Resident Evil what
7682400	7685760	are some of the other big horror franchise series we have and click games
7685760	7692560	scary games we have monster basement 2 we have abandoned to dead-end hotel
7692560	7699200	haunted trap soul orchestrated death inculation x mortis 3 which looks pretty
7699200	7703960	gory the holes crime evidence to you know what actually game was kind of
7703960	7708520	scary this is space this is actually a point-and-click games calm you know what
7708520	7713520	else actually remember the room thank you so salacious pop is jumping up and
7713520	7716160	down in chat I have to say this amnesia because I was thinking of that game too
7716160	7720600	I'm like what's that game that was on steam amnesia yeah amnesia is supposed
7720600	7725040	to be a scary as hell title on that's on PCs I would check out amnesia for sure
7725040	7729320	and that's a point-and-click well but do you remember the little flash game
7729320	7733640	that's called the room or crimson room or something like that Rob do you
7733640	7737440	remember that I'm sorry one more time sorry I was catching up on chat do you
7737440	7741120	remember a game called like it was like crimson room or scarlet room where it
7741120	7744800	was this one where you are in a room on a bed and it's just a little flash game
7744800	7749040	but you have to figure out how to get out of the room and different stuff
7749040	7752400	happens in the room you like you find a lighter and you have to like light some
7752400	7755840	water and make steam to set off something and then you get a string
7755840	7758520	that falls out of somewhere and the whole point is trying to get out of the
7758520	7762320	room is that like don't shit your pants
7762880	7767760	no that's a whole other type of I'll see if I can find it link the chat room but
7767760	7772440	that one it wasn't really so much of a scary game per se but it was sort of
7772440	7779840	like kind of imagining yourself in that situation made it frightening that's
7779840	7784560	what I thought was interesting about it I love that game by the way don't shit
7784560	7790840	your pants it's great game is that it for emails okay I think I actually found
7790840	7796760	it the scarlet room mailbag out orange lounge reader calm if you want to send
7796760	7800000	us emails don't be butthurt if you don't get through though it happens there's
7800000	7802760	also the forms nobody freaking posts on the orange laundry forms and I think we
7802760	7805240	need to fix that we need to make that our mission this year to have some hop
7805240	7809120	and forums so we need to encourage more discussion on the forums we're gonna
7809120	7814600	work on that anyhow that's it for the mailbag yes all right we're gonna get
7814600	7820780	into a game tonight and we're gonna do this with predictions and we're gonna do
7820780	7825400	this in the style of an old board game called taboo remember the game taboo in
7825400	7829640	taboo there were certain phrases that you wanted to say but there were
7829640	7833840	certain things that you didn't want to say so the oil our hosts we're gonna go
7833840	7838320	around right now and give our predictions five things you will see at
7838320	7845080	e3 and five things you won't see at e3 so for everything that you will see at
7845080	7849320	e3 that is in indeed announced that host will earn a point now see we can't tally
7849320	7854040	this up till later in the week but for everything that you won't see that they
7854040	7858880	do say there's gonna be a buzz and that host will lose the point and the host
7858880	7863000	with the most points by whenever we have another show next Sunday after next will
7863000	7870480	win tacos yay so they'll have to buy themselves yes no I if it's not me I
7870480	7876880	will buy tacos if I win then Jamie has to make me tacos all right so here we go
7876880	7882160	five things we think will happen and five things that won't happen let's
7882160	7887720	start with the wills and we'll start with dark Sakura something you will see
7887720	7892640	at e3 this year Microsoft will announce a halo game for connect Microsoft will
7892640	7895760	announce a halo game for connect we're going on kind of a kind of a safe bet I
7895760	7899800	think going off the rumors there right but and actually I blame Dan for my
7899800	7905200	entire list so really he has to buy you tacos if I lose all right fair enough
7905200	7912960	all right so Dan Dan wants the tacos if you win and we'll see what happens all
7912960	7919720	right Loki you got one for us new Super Mario Brothers sequel announced well
7919720	7924520	that's a real safe bet you guys are playing a super easy here you should get
7924520	7928640	a half point for that one all right fine a new Super Mario Bros now I'm gonna I'm
7928640	7932120	gonna go all in I'm gonna make a crazy-ass prediction here I'm gonna say
7932120	7935960	well this isn't that crazy but I think it will be announced at e3 Diablo 3 gets
7935960	7942600	announced for console especially after having played the dungeon siege 3 demo
7942600	7946360	earlier this week I think it can be done and I think Activision is gonna really
7946360	7951520	push blizzard to put that out on the console just to test the waters we'll
7951520	7958520	see I could be full of garbage but this is just for fun right dark Sakura Sony
7958520	7963880	will talk about network security Sony will talk about network security yes
7963880	7969520	they'll talk about how great their online is now know that they're gonna
7969520	7972600	toot their own horn some more and talk about how they're the safest it's gonna
7972600	7978640	be Sony auto fellatio all right fair enough
7978640	7985560	Loki something you will see a new Grand Theft Auto sequel be announced once
7985560	7989800	again playing it very safe that's right a new Grand Theft Auto sequel announced
7989800	7994960	fair enough I'm gonna go out on limb see I'm going crazy I'm gonna say that the
7994960	8001560	hardcore we title that is going to get you back to playing Nintendo III think
8001560	8005200	it's gonna be Star Fox I think it's new Star Fox game will be announced for the
8005200	8011400	cons the new whatever console it is I think if the whole touchscreen thing is
8011400	8016280	true I could definitely see there being mapping and plotting and communications
8016280	8021560	popping up from your little cohorts but most telling of all the fact that there
8021560	8026120	is a Star Fox game in the works being ported for 3ds blast from the past to
8026120	8030200	kind of raise awareness of the franchise again I think Star Fox is gonna be the
8030200	8035560	franchise that gets announced for Nintendo its new console dark soccer
8035560	8041400	they're gonna verify the name of the new PSP the what of the new handheld
8041400	8048280	PlayStation they're gonna verify the name yes it's already leaked I said they were
8048280	8054280	going to announce it uh-huh and before I realized that it had been put out mm-hmm
8054280	8059040	so I said they're going to verify it all right and I'm gonna have to send you the
8059040	8062640	list so you can yeah you'll have to send it to me so you can pile it and look
8062640	8067120	you'll have to do that to IDK and if you guys want to throw out your ideas in
8067120	8074400	chat room chat.org laundry.com things you think will happen at e3 Loki I think
8074400	8078440	that there will be a minor price drop on the Xbox 360 console and connect
8078440	8084160	hardware announced so like a bundle thing no I'm saying they're gonna drop
8084160	8088080	the price of the system and they're also gonna drop the price of the Kinect
8088080	8092560	interesting okay try to get more people on board yeah exactly because that's
8092560	8095360	what they're pushing so you know makes sense that they would try to drop to the
8095360	8103120	price of the console down all right the last drop was back in I don't you know
8103120	8108880	when the last drop was actually um I'm gonna say that these because Soul
8108880	8113240	Calibur 5 we know it's gonna be there the Soul Calibur 5 bonus characters are
8113240	8117440	Capcom inspired this time around they're not gonna be Star Wars absolutely not
8117440	8120600	Star Wars because we've already had that and I think this time they've already
8120600	8123680	done like some of the other big franchises so I think this time Soul
8123680	8127840	Calibur 5 will have Capcom and I'm saying this because of the whole kind of
8127840	8131280	we see them working together in Tekken cross Street Fighter and Street Fighter
8131280	8135840	cross Tekken the one that comes to mind right away Dante I think Dante will be a
8135840	8142980	character in Soul Calibur 5 that's my prediction okay two more Star
8142980	8150520	Sakura um mine was more portal to download content more portal to download
8150520	8155360	content all right like oh like the valve will show off like the user creator
8155360	8163440	stuff yeah there'd be that maybe new maps that they did and more more fun all
8163440	8168200	right Loki this is kind of retarded but new
8168200	8172280	Animal Crossing game announced oh so you think that's gonna be the Nintendo title
8172280	8178040	that comes out the gate I'll be a 3ds hell for sure oh you think it'll be a
8178040	8186280	3ds thing yeah all right um let's see I'm gonna say that valve will show
8186280	8190680	defense of the ancients 2 which I think is a risky pick for me because I think
8190680	8193400	valve is pretty much said they're not showing anything already but I kind of
8193400	8196760	think this game is ready to be shown more of because it's kind of their next
8196760	8199440	big thing they've got in the pipeline so I think defense of the ancients 2 is
8199440	8204760	gonna show up at e3 and one more prediction to round out the five Dark
8204760	8213640	Sakura oh I broke from IRC darn it Dark Sakura um there was well Loki already
8213640	8218440	said it but it was on my list I'm gonna say it anyway an Xbox 360 price drop
8218440	8223480	that's fine if somebody's list is duplicated that's fine in fact I will
8223480	8227800	say one of the things that you said will show at e3 I have in my will not so this
8227800	8233840	is going to be good interesting all right um my oh sorry Loki your fifth and
8233840	8239240	final DS titles on the new Nintendo system will be on their virtual console
8239240	8242440	or download service where the hell they're gonna call it say it virtual
8242440	8250720	console so DS titles on new Nintendo system virtual console sorry black wolf
8250720	8255640	posted in chat the picture from e3 and those that I saw those same creatures in
8255640	8260440	what miklotov sent me those are the rage creatures yeah I saw there was a thing I
8260440	8263800	could talk to where they're all boxed up or whatever they're having they're
8263800	8269760	setting them up okay my last one on my list is I'm gonna go for kind of an easy
8269760	8274320	one Nintendo will demo 3d Netflix I think this is a big thing that they're
8274320	8279200	gonna be showing at e3 and they're gonna be showing 3d Netflix did we disconnect
8279200	8285520	I think we did my win app is crashed I'm still on IRC hold on we're gonna
8285520	8289560	keep recording for the sake of the podcast we are not broadcasting right
8289560	8295040	now hold on just keep up keep going no I know you guys are connected the the win
8295040	8305080	amp crashed over here that's what's wrong okay good old live radio and the
8305080	8310680	pitfalls of it okay we should be connected again so to recap I don't do
8310680	8313760	you have all your five written down let's recap the five things we think
8313760	8318640	will happen so dark soccer your list again a halo game for Kinect network
8318640	8326040	security from Sony verifying the name of the PSP or whatever in GP vitamin more
8326040	8332140	portal to download content and Xbox 360 price drop okay Loki the five things you
8332140	8337120	said will happen and no particular order minor press drop on the Xbox 360 console
8337120	8340920	and Kinect hardware new Animal Crossing game announced a new Grand Theft Auto
8340920	8347920	game announced and new Super Mario game announced and I mean like a new new
8347920	8352000	Super Mario Brothers because that's kind of confusing and redundant and then DS
8352000	8359080	DS titles on the Nintendo new Nintendo system virtual console okay and then my
8359080	8364320	list of five things you will see Diablo 3 announced for a console Star Fox
8364320	8368360	announced as the hardcore Wii title the Soulcalibur 5 bonus characters are
8368360	8372480	Capcom inspired think Dante valve will show defense of the ancients 2 and
8372480	8376560	Nintendo will demo 3d Netflix ok so let's go to the five things you won't
8376560	8381400	see so if these things are said the host loses a point they get buzzed like in
8381400	8386360	tab oops so let's see what the five things that were putting on the card
8386360	8389720	that they won't say stark soccer what's your first one no Final Fantasy 7
8389720	8395240	remake I think that's a very safe bet everyone puts that on the I want to see
8395240	8399760	it list every year and it's not gonna happen yep that's a good one
8399760	8407360	alright so I have no Final Fantasy 7 Loki this would make me sad but no
8407360	8414000	excite truck sequel probably not gonna happen I I actually put on my list Sony
8414000	8419680	will not acknowledge the PlayStation outlet outage directly there I'm gonna
8419680	8424600	say that they will not say something about we apologize for the downtime
8424600	8427920	they're gonna try to look forward not backward that's not to say they won't
8427920	8432880	say secure security and they will emphasize existing security but I don't
8432880	8436760	think you're gonna hear an apology for what happened you already got that
8436760	8442240	supposedly so I don't think they're gonna announce the outage directly we'll
8442240	8447320	see though dark soccer your next one my next one is and this makes me sad
8447320	8456120	Half-Life 2 episode 3 will not be announced nothing Loki I was gonna say
8456120	8459440	the new Nintendo I don't even know see this is the problem I don't even know if
8459440	8463840	they're gonna announce the price but the new Nintendo system will not be under
8463840	8470320	$250 now that's a that's a good guess what do you think it will cost $2.99 I
8470320	8472720	think it's gonna be $2.99 the controllers are gonna be a lot more
8472720	8477120	expensive that's it price is gonna be difficult but they're gonna have to
8477120	8482280	justify it somehow I think the controllers will be $79 $79 99 79 99 and
8482280	8488200	they're gonna be half a DS my list my number two thing on things you won't see
8488200	8493760	killer instinct sorry file that in the fanboy went category too and there's
8493760	8498440	been rumblings this year that it's supposed to come back now no enjoy your
8498440	8501400	Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter remakes and all this because that's as good as
8501400	8508840	it's gonna get dark soccer no new Microsoft or Sega system well you know
8508840	8513200	people there is rumors every year about a Microsoft portable so dark soccer
8513200	8524920	saying nope not happening Loki I would have to say probably that there there's
8524920	8531520	not going to be like I don't even know what you'd call it like the one versus 100 type
8531520	8535640	thing anymore they're not gonna announce you know some sort of community gaming
8535640	8541560	type thing no more community games yeah okay fair enough I'm gonna say that one
8541560	8546560	thing you won't see a Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you will
8546560	8550480	see big pushes on 13 to instead they're gonna just it's not that they're gonna
8550480	8554480	try to erase that 14 ever happened but they're gonna push 13 to before they try
8554480	8561240	to revisit 14 I think dark soccer Sega will make a good Sonic game that's
8561240	8568880	something you won't see that's a good one that's gonna be hard to see we'll
8568880	8574240	have to see what the feedback is in the show floor I suppose all right Loki you
8574240	8578000	will not see a new dance masters game
8578840	8584040	probably not I would you go so far as to say you will not see a
8584040	8591840	non-ddr konami dance game a non-ddr konami dance game yes I would go that
8591840	8597200	far okay funny enough my number four is about a music game as well I don't think
8597200	8602040	you're gonna see a DJ game from harmonix and when I say DJ game from harmonix I
8602040	8606600	mean one that involves a turntable controller because it could be that the
8606600	8609680	new are obviously whatever harmonix makes is gonna be music based but I
8609680	8613880	don't want that interpretation to be too loose I'm talking turntable and keys not
8613880	8617840	happening I think harmonix is gonna go somewhere new with something you haven't
8617840	8623560	thought of and let's see dark soccer let's wrap up the lesson number five
8623560	8630960	Duke Nukem booth dudes as in like you know scantily clad men what if there is
8630960	8635280	a Duke Nukem with that that doesn't count all right I said like you know
8635280	8638240	like scantily clad dudes okay fair enough
8638240	8644800	logi this is gonna be kind of a risky one but and not including because I know
8644800	8648320	that these are coming out because you know I look at this kind of stuff not
8648320	8657640	including these like greatest hits re-releases or third-party games you
8657640	8664960	will not see any new first-party PSP games no new first-party PSP games that's
8664960	8669440	a and I'm talking about actual UMD discs I'm not talking about some stupid like
8669440	8677040	download content I'm talking first-party UMD PSP games black wolf in our chat is
8677040	8679800	calling shenanigans on the fact that you have a Konami thing on your list when
8679800	8682920	they already did a press conference however I'm actually gonna back you up
8682920	8687280	because that doesn't mean it was everything because we don't know what
8687280	8690720	Nintendo's got and anything that Konami is making for the new Nintendo system is
8690720	8696440	under wraps and I I would stand by the fact that just because they didn't say
8696440	8700080	it in their little pre thing doesn't mean it doesn't exist like glee karaoke
8700080	8703160	revolution wasn't in their thing guarantee you there's another one of
8703160	8709400	those coming so I'm gonna allow it even though it's probably a safe bet it will
8709400	8714320	still count for tacos all right and my last answer this is a duplicate and it's
8714320	8719800	it's a painful one but I also put you will not see half-life anything sorry
8719800	8724680	Alan I actually wrote it just like that half-life anything sorry Alan yeah I
8724680	8731680	thought of Alan when I put that but I will keep him when I was at work I would
8731680	8738560	plug in my my little iPhone and listen to all the dialogue through half-life 2
8738560	8743860	well the episodes mm-hmm and that's how I got through half nice because I
8743860	8747840	couldn't you know didn't play much at home so I got to hear the entire game so
8747840	8753000	I was like what more what happens all right let's recap the five buzz things
8753000	8757040	the things that will cause a host to lose a point if it happens dark Sakura
8757040	8763440	my list dun dun dun is no Final Fantasy 7 remake half-life 2 episode 3 will not
8763440	8767880	be announced no new Microsoft or Sega systems Sega will make a good Sonic game
8767880	8774920	and Duke Nukem booth dudes Loki the excite truck sequels not happening the
8774920	8783200	Nintendo system will not be under $250 no community games on you know no off
8783200	8788400	like one versus 100 stuff no dance masters game or non DDR dancing game
8788400	8797840	from Konami and no first-party PSP UMD games all right and on my list of five
8797840	8801040	things you won't see Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outage
8801040	8806000	directly killer instinct Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you'll
8806000	8810920	see big pushes on 13-2 instead you will not see a DJ game from harmonix meaning

8969760	8973560	for not trying harder to do III this year I think I think in retrospect I
8973560	8977680	probably should have done it I'm really looking forward to this whole coverage
8977680	8981560	and kind of trying something different but I don't know it's it's gonna be sad
8981560	8985680	kind of missing all the atmosphere of e3 but at the same time my wallet says
8985680	8992120	thank you but I know there's Disneyland that's gonna rock it's a small world
8992120	8996360	okay you're not gonna subject Bobby that's a small world yes I am no I am

9003760	9009160	row I'm not that mean but Bobby you get to pick you you're either gonna go on
9009160	9014120	California screaming or it's a small world and when you ride it's a small
9014120	9018440	world dark soccer and I will be singing I will warn you it's a small world last

9047640	9052000	straight okay all right back to F use the week sorry Loki F you to Disneyland
9052000	9063320	talk I guess happy not being able to go to E3 really like to have gone to E3 not
9063320	9066080	necessarily to be able to see all the wonderful boots and stuff because I'd
9066080	9071560	be in my own hotel room being able to sleep all night long oh how I wish I
9071560	9078960	could sleep all night long my baby doesn't understand that he needs to
9078960	9084360	sleep at least when your baby is 13 he can mow the lawn oh this is what I have
9084360	9089600	to say parents have no right to complain because they picked this I didn't pick
9089600	9092760	for the child not to sleep through the night you picked to have one yeah I
9092760	9097240	understand that goes with it is it your fault if you buy a car and explodes on
9097240	9104000	you but it's a given that babies wake up at 3 in the morning hungry or poopy or
9104000	9109400	have to pee or that they want mommy all the time it's not really actually all of
9109400	9113040	our friends don't have a problem with that it's just baby nature it's just that
9113040	9116800	our child decides hey you know what I need to be swaddled still at 10 my I
9116800	9121800	wake up that morning some past me whatever you know he just we moved him
9121800	9127600	into his own room so that's also an additional bit of fun I'm just used to
9127600	9133960	it now I wake up at 4 in the morning every day so all right let's move on to

9156040	9160160	kind of cool you know there's been a lot of rumors that there's going to be
9160160	9165440	gaming coming to the Apple TV device but everyone seems to forget hey you know
9165440	9169080	what there's other things out there that you can stream movies on to and now
9169080	9176200	Rovio is actually negotiating with developers to create games specifically
9176200	9183040	for their Roku box and it will I guess be TV based games you know casual stuff
9183040	9188560	and they've really said how the controller gonna work I guess it may be
9188560	9195120	the you know new boxes or whatever can come with a controller but it's kind of
9195120	9198240	neat though to see the gaming is coming to everything I mean I sure won't be
9198240	9202560	long before we're just you know having internet able the TVs that you're
9202560	9208240	playing games off of without any sort of additional software yeah on live
9208240	9214680	without any additional software well I well the boxes that I understand that
9214680	9221680	I'm talking about in internet enabled TV alright alright whatever alright so
9221680	9227640	would you be interested in a Roku box now I had a feeling there's no reason
9227640	9235640	alright let's move on you poor guys are bullying Bobby into writing no no I'm
9235640	9237840	just being honest because keep in mind the first time I read California
9237840	9243480	Screamin I wrote it in the middle and got sick as fuck at least we'll go on
9243480	9247440	Toy Story Midway Mania and that right is amazing it is but no when I when I
9247440	9251120	started writing California Screamin in the front car never got sick again
9251120	9256080	it's the same like being in the front seat of the car I get motion sick in the
9256080	9260000	backseat in the front seat of mine alright one more story for you guys
9260000	9262880	before we get to the Skype line this story is about Animal Crossing but it
9262880	9267040	might not be what you're expecting it's a story that Kotaku ran earlier this
9267040	9271840	week and I guess it was kind of from another site called anti pixelante.com
9271840	9278520	here's the deal it's a story about I don't even know where to go here with
9278520	9283440	Animal Crossing the tie the story is titled if you could bone one Animal
9283440	9287920	Crossing character who would it be and the site anti pixelante.com has actually
9287920	9294160	combed the depths of I guess what is this site called like rule 34 which I
9294160	9298960	guess rule 34 is an internet rule about if it exists there's porn full of it so
9298960	9304240	these people anti pixelante.com actually combed the website to find what Animal
9304240	9309400	Crossing characters were most popular on rule 34 and believe it or not there were
9309400	9317480	59 pornographic images of the stitch lady that helps you to the crop make
9317480	9322760	your own patterns Hazel yeah Hazel so Hazel was the most popular character
9322760	9327400	with 59 pornographic images next up and I'm surprised he wasn't number one Tom
9327400	9333760	Nook was second place with 30 and then the other well it's Abel and Mabel or
9333760	9337360	something like that isn't it the Abel sisters the Abel sisters the other Abel
9337360	9342080	sister had Mabel and Mabel and then KK whatever he is

9739360	9744440	how are you I'm doing good are you excited for e3 I don't know if I'm
9744440	9750240	excited more for e3 or not going on California screaming yeah I'm trying to
9750240	9754320	get them to stop picking on you but you know you should be glad my friend
9754320	9758200	Victoria isn't going because she says I have a rule you go on every ride once
9758200	9762680	and if you don't like you never have to go on it again but I'm a little more
9762680	9765320	forgiving if somebody says no Rob I'm really not going on I'm like okay
9765320	9769440	whatever I did that I'm not gonna bully I went on I went on a Tower of Terror
9769440	9773240	and it sucks but if Bobby's like I don't want Bobby to barf so if he's gonna barf
9773240	9777060	he's not going on it anyway yes yeah I wouldn't barf what it is is I do have a
9777060	9782840	medical condition and I will pass out and I don't want to pass out if Disney
9782840	9785480	doesn't want me to pass out because then they escort you out of the park yes you
9785480	9789200	will have to you will have to hydrate him and watch over him if he passes out
9789200	9792560	because you forced me to go on that right all right Dan's like then we get
9792560	9797560	to go backstage all right look we're playing the little game tonight about
9797560	9801400	things you will see and things you won't see at e3 and you're calling shenanigans
9801400	9805880	on Loki's list I know but so Bobby I'm gonna put you on the spot I won't make
9805880	9809280	you name five but tell me something you think we will see maybe that we missed
9809280	9815440	something we will see is something we won't see well I mean the won't see is
9815440	9818440	actually I had a call on my show tonight that asked me you know what what would
9818440	9824440	you not see there and I said a new Space Quest or really any new Sierra adventure
9824440	9828880	titles I think that's a pretty fair guess yeah because I mean I can't see
9828880	9832920	Activision re resurrecting King's Quest or anything like that well have we had
9832920	9837820	the telltale King's Quest games were announced didn't that come out a few
9837820	9846440	months ago yeah but we won't see it at e3 I'm gonna get my buzzer ready I'm not
9846440	9852480	playing all right fine we'll see we'll see all right what about something that
9852480	9859540	will happen something that will I'm you know it's kind of hard because like I've
9859540	9865720	seen a lot of the stuff that you know kind of is going in and stuff what we
9865720	9874960	will see I I think we will I think we will get a price on the Nintendo I think
9874960	9878860	they will say the price interest even though it's end of 2012 I think they're
9878860	9881520	gonna go ahead and announce a price or at least something they're aiming for
9881520	9886760	yes hmm okay that's a pretty fair really it's end of 2012 I thought it would be
9886760	9891880	the same launch frame as 3ds Wow I didn't realize that boy that's a long
9891880	9896520	tease now what I want to see is I want to see them do pac-man versus is one of
9896520	9900680	the demo games they could they could re-release all that stuff that they did
9900680	9904800	for the Game Boy Advance connect cable that nobody ever played can they will
9904800	9909400	because that's Nintendo oh well that's easy let's do it that way the only one
9909400	9911880	that probably wouldn't happen is Crystal Chronicles because that wasn't first
9911880	9915400	party that was a weird game I liked it but it was weird it wasn't really
9915400	9921320	fantasy it was just kind of in that storyline I guess all right well any
9921320	9924800	other thoughts for us Bobby before we talk to you again on Tuesday live from
9924800	9930600	Los Angeles okay so I'm supposed to look for large chibis mm-hmm and I'm supposed
9930600	9935660	to look for Duke Nukem booth dudes yes okay okay so weak so I could can I
9935660	9939560	provide the buzzer if I find the booth dudes yes you can because I have found
9939560	9945360	they hate they usually do have somewhere the scantily clad muscular guys right
9945360	9950560	now the question is are they going to be advertising Duke Nukem we'll find out so
9950560	9953800	get that buzzer ready and yes you I give you full permission to buzz dark soccer
9953800	9958360	if that happens although really like I'm gonna buzz me I'm sure all right yes
9958360	9963700	did you go by telltale smooth all right no it's fine I don't I don't think they
9963700	9968040	have a booth II they I don't think they do it either they do that was they do it

10009800	10014040	actually has a huge world like in the anime because I started watching on a
10014040	10020800	minute so she pretty good Ubisoft not what I'm sorry I see this type of thing
10020800	10023960	I'd usually expect from Ubisoft but here's one of Activision's big
10023960	10027920	announcements that they're gonna be making Activision Publishing and Sega
10027920	10034920	toys they have created wappy dog wappy dog is basically an eyebo ripoff for the
10034920	10041840	Nintendo DS and it will allow you to interact with the robot dog in the game
10041840	10052040	and you will to does wappy dog come with Jack a cat I don't think that's what it
10052040	10060320	sounds like to me wappy dog wappy dog wappy dog and Jackie cat I'm 12 I have
10060320	10065360	problems other ocean interactive they have announced that they're gonna be
10065360	10068480	working on a new project for Xbox Live arcade and PlayStation Network based on
10068480	10073820	the HG Wells novel war of the worlds and of course it's gonna be you know
10073820	10080040	following the events of the 1953 film and include a new story arc characters
10080040	10084360	locations and subplots you know I'd actually be kind of cool to see like
10084360	10088080	something like this like resistance style or something like that
10088080	10091600	it's not as Tom Cruise isn't involved let's go to the let's go to the phones
10091600	10094360	for another call higher on Orange launch radio who's this
10094360	10100560	legends off of here legend of Zaku what's up my friend nothing much just
10100560	10106480	getting ready to know for tomorrow's a case of the Mondays you sit back and
10106480	10112160	watch the press conferences you can have your popcorn yeah I'm gonna be trying to
10112160	10116440	you know browse it from my desk there you go I mean I have two monitors so I
10116440	10121360	could probably pull it off on one of them but going on going on what I was
10121360	10124860	trying to bring up tonight was the whole Call of Duty elite thing which is
10124860	10130840	basically activisions next you know shameless attempted and money-grabbing
10130840	10137280	mmm I'm sensing you're not a fan no I mean I don't understand when other other
10137280	10142800	like when other developers other companies you know like like Bungie and
10142800	10148520	EA have offered these services for free and activisions mostly paywalling the
10148520	10154560	the good stuff like videos I mean it's what I'm sensing is that they are
10154560	10159400	probably going to herald the the next video game crash you think about it and
10159400	10163600	I bring this up because you think about how the first one happened and how this
10163600	10168600	one might might draw parallels to the one half the one in 83 where you have
10168600	10173080	like one we have one particular company just trying to hash out you know
10173080	10177960	multiple just trying to just trying to rehash franchises to the point where
10177960	10184800	quality degrades and you know fans get turned off you know I I don't think
10184800	10188320	another video game crash across the board is possible I think there is
10188320	10191800	possible company failures I don't think forever you're going to have Nintendo
10191800	10195360	Sony Microsoft one of them will fail where you're getting to the point where
10195360	10199880	activisions literally watering down diluting the entire first-person shooter
10199880	10206920	genre like if people for the most you know if for the most part consumers I'm
10206920	10210640	not talking about the hardcore gamers the ones that consistently by Call of
10210640	10215440	Duty you know the ones that basically don't have other first-person shooters
10215440	10222120	lined up aside from aside from like the second Call of Duty Halo gears you know
10222120	10227600	like the small really I'm trying to like put my finger on the demographic but
10227600	10231880	it's the type of person that wouldn't care less about what the scene things in
10231880	10236840	more important you know it's just like instantly gratified by by just
10236840	10239960	explosions so what about what about just like voting with your dollars you know
10239960	10244000	it's a concept we were talking about a lot I understand that it's possible but
10244000	10249360	when you have when you have one company just giving negative connotations to one
10249360	10253480	genre but just like trying to nickel and dime people every step of the way and
10253480	10258240	just trying to like not really innovate then it's gonna be harder for other
10258240	10263840	titles to really stand out unless battlefield 3 manages to pull an upset
10263840	10267920	which I know it will because it has a lot to offer on the table and I think
10267920	10271120	that yeah I don't think it's gonna lead to a crash I think it would just be yeah
10271120	10274800	battlefield 3 might become the new champion you know or maybe I get to the
10274800	10278840	point where video gamers are gonna get sick and tired of actually of having to
10278840	10282240	deal with just mediocrity okay well let me throw this question at you kind of
10282240	10285240	out of left field here because you mentioned Halo is one of the games that
10285240	10289600	you think has done it very well but we know that activism bungee every party
10289600	10294640	for every bunch he was the first was first really to pioneer such a thing
10294640	10299160	where they integrated you know the ability to look up your stats online and
10299160	10303880	post the video straight from the console but I know it has the bungee and
10303880	10306520	Activision are partnering up for whatever this next game at least
10306520	10310920	Activision is publishing it so do you think that the same you know nickel and
10310920	10315360	dime extra stuff I don't really need the thing is gonna continue and now it's
10315360	10319680	under Activision I mean Microsoft didn't do that much didn't even do any of that
10319680	10324040	like I know when you know when bungee was working with Microsoft that never
10324040	10328600	happened because they were trying new ways to engage people into the into that
10328600	10334160	genre and into that game and what better way and then to launch all you know the
10334160	10339040	the whole halo waypoint thing I believe where it allows you to interact you know
10339040	10344520	look up your scores post it on Facebook and so forth but then you know when
10344520	10348200	Activision is thrown into the mix you have a company that's helping on just
10348200	10353320	trying to like monetize and maximize every single every single dollar out of
10353320	10357760	all their their IP to the point where just like they're willing to cut
10357760	10362560	corners and sacrifice quality in the name of the almighty dollar let me ask
10362560	10365280	this question we gotta wrap up and get more calls let me ask this question in
10365280	10370240	on this what do you think they could do to make more money on the franchise that
10370240	10375640	doesn't seem so nickel-and-dime well first of all you shouldn't try to like
10375640	10380600	you shouldn't try to nickel and dime for things that are have been offered for
10380600	10385680	free in the past like that whole call of duty elite that it looks many people
10385680	10390560	just like shrugged it off so far because from what I heard for example on the
10390560	10395360	other sites like a taco for example they basically you know they basically shut
10395360	10399400	they basically wrote it off as just another money grab so they basically
10399400	10404640	they have they really have no hopes for this um for this endeavor they really
10404640	10409080	don't they just like it doesn't faze them it doesn't engage them that well
10409080	10414120	and that's getting a really lukewarm reception right and you know more
10414120	10418680	importantly trying to create innovative ways to re-engage your customers like
10418680	10424040	try not to be hacked the same you know the same boring old five-hour campaign
10424040	10430080	and instead offering new ways to offer balanced gameplay like if they fix up
10430080	10434400	the game playing in multiplayer where it's not a camp fest then they could
10434400	10438680	then they have a better shot we at least have one person agreeing with you in the
10438680	10442520	chat room dark toa gak says Activision is one shit of a company for something
10442520	10446880	for lack of something less constructive to say all right buddy we're gonna let
10446880	10449080	you go so we try to get at least one more call tonight but have a good one
10449080	10452960	all right have a good one later one eight seven seven game olr or a
