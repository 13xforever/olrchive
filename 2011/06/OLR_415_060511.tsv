13812	24862	Tonight, June 5th, 2011, the E3 rumors start to roll in a day before the first press conference, the track listing for the Play for Japan benefit album is unveiled, and soon you can raise pets in The Sims 3.
31616	37779	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38299	46443	We're going to talk about video games over the next three hours or so, and you can join us if you're listening to us live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
46463	52085	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
52565	55387	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-host.
55407	59569	Say hello to the one, the only, the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
59589	59809	Hi.
59829	60149	How are you?
61576	65630	I'm recovering from my party it's your party and you'll cry if you want to
66252	67573	I cried when everyone left.
67593	69753	I was like, they're gone.
69973	70934	Now it wasn't your birthday.
70954	71874	It wasn't a birthday party.
71914	72614	So what was the party?
73074	79897	It was for me getting two associate's degrees after 15 years of going to college.
80237	81778	You are a professional student.
82078	84679	I've changed my major so many times is the problem.
84739	87420	So I got my art and media, which is basically graphic design.
88680	90020	I have liberal arts.
90321	92881	And then next spring I'll have social sciences.
93082	94042	You just like to learn.
94961	95942	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
117307	117607	All right.
118107	120968	The voice over there, of course, the one and the only Tech Master, Loki.
121088	121508	How you doing?
121808	122368	I'm doing good.
122789	123089	All right.
123349	127990	By the way, we were off last week, so it's a little interesting to be back here after two weeks.
128030	129970	But I hope you all had a good Memorial Day weekend.
130431	131611	I don't know what you guys did.
131791	132611	I went to Disneyland.
132651	133211	It was fun.
133992	135452	But what else is new here at Orange Lounge Radio?
135472	135792	Guess what?
135972	137072	I don't ever travel anywhere else.
137593	137773	What?
138013	138673	We're going again.
138793	140433	I know, and I'm going again this weekend.
140473	142894	I'll get into more of that later on because it's kind of sick.
143454	145035	Well, Loki, what have you been up to?
145255	146295	What did you do with your days off?
147535	148056	I don't remember.
149056	151337	Probably not sleeping.
152297	153438	It's that time, huh?
154338	155418	We mean it's that time.
155499	159760	It's been that time for 10 months.
159800	160941	I thought he was sleeping through the night.
161021	161761	Now he's not anymore?
162581	167563	Well, he sleeps through the night, but he also wakes up about eight times during the night.
167843	168104	I see.
168364	168584	I see.
169464	175629	Alright, well, of course, if you are new to Orange Lawns Radio, Loki and the Mrs. gave birth to Josh, what, about nine months ago?
175729	176229	Ten months ago.
176549	177770	He didn't give birth to him.
177830	178551	Well, you know what I mean.
179792	180832	He was there when it happened.
181773	183935	But he did not go through labor.
184095	187357	He made a very important contribution to the whole process.
188077	189959	Yeah, but the woman does all the work.
190785	191346	Here we go.
191846	192127	Okay.
192147	193168	You and your women's lib.
193488	193748	No.
195450	197192	Stop burning your bra here on this show.
197333	198434	I'm not even wearing one.
198614	199435	Ah, bleh.
199555	199835	All right.
201017	201758	Moving on.
202118	203720	I'm in my pajamas for tonight's show.
204801	207764	The chatters in chat.orangelaunchradio.com are like, oh yeah, prove it.
208205	208746	All right, anyhow.
209226	209607	Here I will.
212560	214183	Here comes Dan, who's on mic.
214284	215045	Shut up!
215606	216147	What did he say?
216168	216789	I didn't even catch it.
216829	218132	I didn't hear what he said either.
218172	219955	Something blah blah irrational psycho.
219975	220717	That's all I picked up.
220777	221759	He just needs to shut up forever.
221899	222601	That was enough for me.
223002	223222	Okay.
225211	226212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
244827	249610	because we're doing shows Tuesday and Wednesday this next week.
249690	253112	They are live E3 specials, different place.
253652	256954	They're not going to be at allgames.com because there's other stuff going on.
257294	261857	And we also wanted to help you guys learn about our brand new Ustream channel is now up and running.
262477	263958	Our username there is Orange Lounge.
264018	266960	More information will be available at orangelounge.com later this week.
267440	270022	And best of all, our good buddy, Bobby Blackwolf.
270462	285275	who does the show before us here at All Games Radio will be joining us over the Tuesday and Wednesday nights to be talking about what he's observing at the show floor what's going on behind the scenes at the press conferences what Sony is filling five and a half hours with pray tell tomorrow night
285955	288037	and then Miklatov is also going to be joining us.
288077	302030	They're both going to Nintendo's press thing and will get to fill us in on what it was like to play whatever Nintendo's calling their new system without a three and a half hour wait or whatever long that line is going to be at E3 which I am looking forward to not standing in.
302371	306574	It's very strange because it's not like I haven't been to E3 before.
306674	308256	I didn't go during the airport years but
308516	311619	But it's going to be interesting doing coverage from this end of things.
311739	324349	But I'm happy that we'll be able to produce something a lot more slick, where we'll be able to take your calls, have the live chat room, which will still be in the same place, chat.orangelandre.com, and let you guys interact with the E3 coverage.
324369	333697	And of course, give your feedback, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, and we'll be voices here in the studio, voices on the E3 show floor, and your voices out there all over the internet.
333737	335959	Oh man, I've got to wait until Tuesday.
336579	337919	For Nintendo, yeah.
337939	342080	Just so you guys know how it's all going down, tomorrow there is no Expo.
342540	348101	The Expo floor is not open, but the E3 show kind of starts because that's when the press conferences start.
348441	354463	Microsoft kicks it off in the morning, then Sony's going to be in the evening, scrunched in there, Ubisoft and EA.
354763	359644	Konami already happened, which we'll be getting to a little later, so we'll talk about what they talked about.
359664	360844	They're not doing their own conference.
361725	366431	Also, I noticed left out Activision, unless I just completely overlooked it, which is possible.
366471	369235	I'm sure somebody in the chat room will jump in with that if I miss it.
369255	375062	They also tend to usually have a lot of announcements, like Call of Duty will usually be shown at Sony or Microsoft's conference.
375463	378387	It's like, whoa, I've never seen that before on these consoles.
378627	391271	My thought, too, is that Activision kind of really blew their load last year with that whole Eminem, Rihanna, all those celebs they paraded out on stage for DJ Hero 2, which then, well, you know, it didn't end up doing so hot.
392411	393332	Although it was a fine game.
393592	394292	I enjoyed DJ Hero 2.
394352	397173	Yeah, I was asking because my boss is going.
397273	405656	Actually, my boss and our vice president of sales, the guy doesn't know anything about gaming, so he's going to E3.
406556	406796	Awesome.
407616	411339	Anyway, so they're going, so you guys going to any of the parties or anything while you're there?
411759	419284	It's like, no, it's not anything like when they had the DJ Hero 2 thing where they had people DJing and Eminem and stuff like that.
419744	424848	They're having, I don't remember which publisher it is, but someone's having a bowling night.
425488	426609	Nice, nice.
427289	431691	Black Wolf, our good pal, is in our chat room saying Activision has a booth, but they don't have a concert.
432191	437153	So it is, yeah, whatever their big announcement is might be at one of the other press conferences.
437193	438133	I think you're right on with that.
438413	440414	They don't have really any big announcements.
440434	441635	The Bungie thing, right?
441755	442715	That's got to be this year.
443175	444936	They've got to give us more details on the Bungie thing.
446316	452958	All they've got coming out... They've announced everything up through the third quarter as of last week.
454058	456619	So they haven't announced their fourth quarter stuff other than Call of Duty.
457579	460340	But there's not a lot that they can really cram in there.
460460	464341	Usually there's a Guitar Hero game around that time.
465001	470103	But they've got the X-Men game, they've got the new Spider-Man game...
471414	478828	They have a crappy Spyro game that has some stupid little toy thing that you gotta scan your toy in order to play the character in the game.
480191	481734	And then of course they've also got...
486571	491054	I think they might be blowing a big announcement about Diablo before a BlizzCon.
491814	494196	Blizzard's all their own thing.
494216	495937	They're not going to announce any of that.
496077	501041	Activision has been the one calling the shots for a little while, which is why some of us WoW advocates think the game's gone.
502221	503903	Little bit south the past couple of years.
504143	509768	They may announce a console port because there's already rumors that they hired people to port over the PlayStation 3.
509828	515434	I actually think that's exactly what the announcement is going to be, but we'll get into that later when we get into E3 predictions a little later on.
515474	515894	Woohoo!
516875	517095	Okay.
517896	520878	I'm going to try, actually, we're going to go... I'm...
522881	524461	This is definitely live radio here.
524581	527362	We actually have a man on the ground already in L.A.
527442	529463	who's also going to be joining us on the Tuesday-Wednesday shows.
529823	533324	We're actually going to give him a call right now, live, unscripted.
533884	536885	He's actually at some type of event already, and I want to get more details on that.
536985	538805	I know he's already been by the convention center.
539225	544527	So we're going to give our old buddy Miklatov a call and see what's up in L.A.
544547	544827	right now.
546307	548668	This may be botched a little bit.
548708	551229	He's at some event, and I'll get some more details on what's going on.
551269	552009	It could be very noisy.
553314	555156	So, one ringy dingy, two ringy dingys.
555756	556177	Hello?
556297	557158	Hey, Miklatov!
558479	559039	Hey, what's up?
559119	559680	Hey, not much.
559760	561201	It's Rob, of course, Orange Launch Radio.
561461	562943	You know that because I've been text messaging you.
563263	563523	What's up?
563543	563964	Where are you at?
563984	564424	You're at an event.
564484	564744	I know.
564784	565966	It's supposed to be crazy.
566186	567507	The E3 parties have already started.
567547	567987	What's going on?
569449	571771	Yeah, this is the... What is this I'm at?
572752	573753	Where am I at right now?
575034	575975	Lucky Strike.
576035	579057	It's for Major Nelson's Twitter.
579338	579578	Mm-hmm.
581455	594319	and it's a huge meetup where they're giving away food and drinks and free bowling and most importantly passes to the presser event tomorrow
600033	600554	No, that's not it.
601134	602736	Someone else is actually doing the bowling alley.
602756	604678	Here at the bowling alley, it's just some colored balloons.
604698	606119	But I actually went into the E3 Expo Hall.
624690	625611	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
626291	628093	Breaking, put that on Twitter, everybody.
628173	632476	Breaking, Microsoft unveils colored balloons at E3.
632856	634357	It's a brand new thing for the Kinect.
634397	639161	Oh my god, this is almost as good as the spacesuits last year.
639181	639822	What was that last year?
639842	644465	They are green and white, and I guess that's purple for Kinect.
644785	647347	Breaking, Breaking, Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.
647808	649089	This is an exclusive report.
649429	652752	I don't know what you're saying, but they're about to get more tickets away, so I'm going to hang up on you.
652912	653452	Goodbye.
657065	668061	Yep, that's exactly what it's going to sound like Tuesday and Wednesday as well, is that we'll get the nice professional radio call from Bobby Blackwolf, and then when he decides he's got to hang up to go to a swanky party, then Miklatov's going to call us.
668382	670886	Yeah, I don't know what really happened today, but I saw some balloons.
676192	678174	Space Ponchos Space Ponchos
696790	700232	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
700292	702514	There was a crapload of rock band last night.
702534	705736	We had Rock Band 3 and Beatles Rock Band going on last night.
706417	710039	And I sang a lot and my throat hurts.
711340	712220	I haven't lost my voice.
712240	712961	What did you sing?
713181	714082	What are your specialties?
714982	718285	Well, I don't have the song that apparently everyone says I'm really good at.
719325	724249	So I was singing My Chemical Romance and...
726516	727276	What else did I do?
727877	731119	Nine in the Afternoon, Panic at the Disco, which is one of my favorite songs.
732340	736262	I think I did some Kansas.
738203	741845	Any chance we could get you to hum a few bars?
742686	742926	No.
744927	752512	I sang just about everything that we did in Beatles Rock Band, except for three that Junami sang.
753692	754533	He was at the party, too.
756152	757173	There's a blast from the past.
757213	758214	Intern Drew, good job.
758654	768062	And I also played WoW, which I did today, and yelled at the ship for not arriving on time, or at least on time in my universe.
770003	770644	Sorry, I have to share this.
770664	771745	Mikulatov just texted me.
771785	773326	He's like, you can call me back.
773506	774627	It was too loud to hear the numbers.
774667	777389	I'm like, I will call when you have something news besides colored balloons.
780832	781313	Don't judge.
783074	783995	They're green and white.
785174	785814	No shit.
786014	786875	It's Xbox.
787915	789136	And Dan's been playing L.A.
789176	789476	Noire.
789856	793397	And I've beat Portal 2 now for like the ninth time.
794077	795158	And I'm on my tenth playthrough.
796018	796779	On single player mode.
797819	799520	And I find something new every time.
799620	800100	It's fun.
801160	804101	But I finally got the Smash TV achievement, Rob.
805082	805682	That was hard.
807140	820164	Well, all the other ones are easy except for the last one you have to get, which is the room where... It's like you go in and there's a glass to your right and then there's three turrets.
820805	823305	And the button you need to press is in front of the turrets on the other side of the glass.
823906	827327	So you have to go across and send the little...
828107	830448	And then that's how you get the last one.
853069	853650	DarkSakura.com
873837	875478	All right, anything else for your gaming week?
876939	877519	We had pie.
878440	879561	Loki, how was your gaming week?
879641	880862	Orange sickle cupcakes.
880942	881882	My gaming week was all right.
882002	883183	I didn't play a whole lot.
883243	888627	I played Portal through a little bit again, cheating all the way this time, which is fun.
888667	890968	Just mainly just the kill time.
891529	892949	I didn't really want to play anything else.
894310	896832	Played more Grand Theft Auto, as usual, and...
898493	899094	Let's see.
899534	902056	Also, a tiny little bit of L.A.
902076	902416	Noire.
902596	909281	Didn't really get a whole lot of time to play it, but I made it through the first kind of case that you have there.
910562	911303	It's interesting.
911323	914826	I mean, the game's really detailed, but I don't know.
914846	915746	I'd probably get into it.
915886	917708	I just have to have some time to play it.
919309	920050	That's pretty much it.
921311	921591	Wow.
922892	925394	Sounds like you had a pretty quick week for games.
925885	933226	Yeah, well, I'm still working on Grand Theft Auto mods and a whole bunch of other garbage.
934907	937528	Anything that you're kind of looking forward to with the next week?
937588	940148	Any demos that might hit the store that you're like, ooh, I gotta play that?
940268	945409	No, oh, by the way, my dev console got banned from PartnerNet, which is kind of disappointing.
945469	945790	Really?
945830	946450	How did that happen?
946470	947110	How'd you get caught?
947370	952011	No, I think it's just they eventually banned all of them, you know, after a while.
952491	953391	But it doesn't matter.
953491	955772	There wasn't really anything on PartnerNet that I wanted to play.
955812	957772	It was all Xbox Live Arcade games.
957852	960693	There's no, like, you know, betas for, you know...
960933	961213	JTagConsole
982017	983860	You're getting better about hiding that stuff.
984521	985282	Eh, whatever.
985402	986944	I don't really even care.
986964	995456	Well, if there's anything like last year, like almost all the trailers that will be at the press conference tomorrow, you will see then show up on Xbox to download.
995496	998079	So, you know, see it in glorious HD.
998920	1000662	I'm not even worried about playing demos for stuff.
1001783	1004626	There are some games that look really awesome.
1005366	1009770	Saints Row 3 I was pretty excited for from the get-go because I love Saints Row.
1009810	1019319	It kept the fun aspect and the really over-the-top part of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and they just keep building upon it.
1020340	1024361	The first game was sort of a Grand Theft Auto rip-off, but it's really become kind of its own thing.
1024681	1027022	And I love just the whole game.
1027042	1028962	It's just really fun.
1029562	1034244	And the new one that they have coming out this fall just looks amazing.
1034704	1035784	Really, I can't wait to play it.
1035884	1040665	Even if they do announce a new Grand Theft Auto game, I love both games.
1040805	1042786	Both series I think can coexist because...
1043346	1072447	they're just kind of different I am very disappointed though that the third doesn't have online multiplayer as far as like death matches and stuff goes because I mean I don't know the first first game was kind of it wasn't very good as far as what they had online and the second game they tried to mix it up a little bit but it was really wacky the way they had everything they really should just stuck with you know kind of doing a Grand Theft Auto style where it's okay here's a portion of the map and you play in and go you know something simple like that
1073087	1083515	but they tried to do some funky stuff with it and it was alright but the maps they had were really kind of limited and the fun was kind of limited too but at least they have online co-op for two players this time
1084133	1090035	Let me go to our chatroom at chat.orangelondradio.com and I think Breakman's pretty much echoing something you just said here.
1090115	1092376	Saints Row 3 doesn't have any multiplayer versus though.
1092556	1092936	Frown?
1093076	1095757	Yeah, just two-player online co-op like the second game.
1096457	1100619	Which is fun, you know, because I have Grand Theft Auto, so... Co-op can be fun.
1100839	1101679	Yeah, co-op is fun.
1101819	1110422	And it was actually a lot of fun playing System Link co-op with the second Saints Row game, so I'm looking forward to this new one for sure.
1111003	1112263	And I mean, you know,
1114241	1120804	and right now I'm still playing lots of Grand Theft Auto but that's going to interrupt or something's going to interrupt that though come July.
1121404	1121824	July.
1122645	1127747	July 5th to be exact is when we get the new Earth Defense Force game.
1129328	1130148	That's going to be awesome.
1130188	1131009	Counting down the days.
1131209	1131489	Oh yeah.
1131989	1132870	DUNGEON SIEGE 3 DUNGEON SIEGE 3
1149107	1151408	And I thought the first two games, you know, they made their point.
1151448	1152248	They had their relevance.
1152308	1153829	Of course, they were PC-only titles.
1154509	1162692	But now Square Enix is behind the publishing of this third game that's happening now on the consoles and, I believe, PCs later on.
1163052	1164452	So the demo's available on Xbox Live.
1164472	1164972	It's all the same time.
1165413	1165553	Huh?
1165653	1166273	It's all the same time.
1166293	1166873	Yeah, all the same time.
1167793	1170514	So the demo's now available on Xbox Live, and it's very Diablo-esque.
1170694	1172455	If you've never played Dungeons & Dragons, it's very Diablo.
1172495	1174396	It was kind of Microsoft's answer to Diablo in some ways.
1175076	1176376	And so the game's very Diablo-esque.
1176817	1177757	And it was okay.
1178457	1191621	I had a good time playing it, but I thought, especially following up a game like Torchlight, it was nice to see the more robust graphics and that Square Enix Cinema presentation style.
1192942	1195202	Was it something I'm excited to spend $60 on?
1195723	1199204	No, not based off the demo, but will I rent it or get it in a bargain bin?
1199304	1200024	Sure, absolutely.
1201044	1204166	It's a very challenging position we're in right now in the gaming industry.
1204286	1207987	It's going to be interesting to see what develops with this E3.
1208067	1210669	Some games you are expected to pay $60 for.
1211129	1215311	Some games, like Angry Birds, you're expected to pay $1 for or even get free.
1215371	1217892	It's really about trying to find that happy price point.
1217932	1220413	We're talking about a new Nintendo console coming out at E3.
1220693	1221794	What are the games going to cost?
1222054	1223474	Is Nintendo now going to up the bar to $60?
1224015	1226636	Although some would argue they have been already.
1227756	1228937	Oh yeah, I don't doubt.
1229257	1231039	But are the games going to be worth it?
1231159	1237423	I mean, there's a certain point where the consumer goes, hmm, do I really buy this at $60 or do I just wait until it comes down in price?
1238744	1239144	I don't know.
1239364	1241425	It's a tricky... NGP games are $50.
1241786	1242866	Wow.
1243607	1243907	Really?
1244047	1244948	But PSP games were $50.
1245788	1249371	Well, not a lot of PSP games were $50, but there were a few.
1249391	1249811	The big ones.
1250031	1254995	But like $40 is kind of the price point for the PSP.
1255075	1255755	But they did have $50 games.
1257516	1259637	So that's all I really want to say about the demo.
1259657	1260018	It was cool.
1261558	1265040	Fable 3 I got to play, which this game's what, like a year and a half old?
1265060	1268843	So I bet a lot of you that were interested in this have probably already played it, but I was a little late to the party.
1269263	1269823	I played the game.
1270423	1270864	It's neat.
1271144	1273145	There's a lot of concepts in Fable I really like.
1273945	1276527	But I sometimes wonder if this game tries to do too much.
1276707	1279829	And at its core, it's really repetitive.
1280269	1282110	And it's like a Facebook game.
1282410	1282890	Repetitive.
1282951	1283111	Like...
1284091	1300474	I like the fact that you do these quests to enhance relationship with villagers and I like this whole way that the villager enhancement thing is built in but when you're doing the same fetch quest or the same delivery quest multiple times you're like okay so what am I doing here?
1301334	1311856	I felt like it's just very very repetitive I cannot trust anything Peter Molyneux says anymore I mean seriously all of his innovative stuff is such bullshit because it's just like
1312556	1314918	I added a dog to my game.
1315178	1317319	No other game has had dogs in it before.
1317640	1318640	This dog you'll love.
1318740	1320401	No, I didn't give a shit about the dog.
1320441	1321982	Yeah, the dog was cool, but you know what?
1322002	1324704	The dog was as cool as any other dog in any other game.
1325064	1327026	The dog was actually kind of stupid sometimes.
1327614	1332336	The biggest crime for me that Fable 3 made, I don't feel it took the series forward.
1332376	1333196	I feel it took it back.
1333796	1335777	I think Fable 2 was a much better game.
1336117	1339418	And I think it had that whole good and evil thing developed.
1339458	1341058	And like Fable 3, I don't even notice it.
1341158	1342919	It really doesn't even seem like that exists in it.
1343219	1345400	It's more about this whole path to being a king.
1345420	1346320	It's more politics.
1346420	1348421	Which is a very repetitive...
1350481	1353943	I was really into it for about an hour and a half and then I got bored of it.
1354523	1356464	I got really bored of it and I was like, you know what, I'm done.
1357024	1358925	I don't really want to play anymore Fable 3.
1360565	1365987	I feel bad saying it because there's a lot that I like about the Fable series and I really liked Fable 2.
1366427	1368728	I think Fable 3 was rushed, to be honest.
1368868	1371089	I think they needed to wait another year to put this game out.
1371189	1371710	I'm giving it back.
1391351	1392572	I hope it's interesting.
1392592	1392672	No.
1392692	1392992	Anyhow.
1417385	1438825	Katsune in our chatroom says I got really bored with it quickly as well yeah I mean it's just and and the whole I know y'all love this term microtransactions for like outfits and weapons and stuff no that was an obvious bad that was just microtransactions gone bad I would I would never drop a penny on any of it period
1439125	1439425	Sorry.
1441046	1449370	The other game I played this week, I got to watch Alan play the Duke Nukem Forever demo, which hit Steam over the weekend.
1449590	1453552	And I have to admit, I like its very tongue-in-cheek.
1454072	1458635	It does not make any pauses about where exactly this game comes from.
1458955	1462396	Have you seen, Loki, the opening sequence to Duke Nukem Forever in the demo?
1463277	1463457	Yes.
1464316	1492891	and I love that it starts in the whole football scene which is very reminiscent of the end of the last game which was in the football stadium but then it and this is a little bit spoilery but deal with it it's the first five minutes of the game it pans out of the football field or whatever and you see that Duke is actually playing the video game and it pans out so far that you see these two girls are actually giving him a blowjob while he's playing the game they are the Molson twins by the way the Molson twins yeah
1493351	1496012	and they're like, oh, was that good for you?
1496112	1497693	Or Wholesome Twins or something like that.
1497793	1500254	It's basically the Wholesome Twins.
1500294	1503495	They go something like, oh, was the game good, Duke?
1503535	1506836	And then he goes, yeah, well, after 12 fucking years, it better be.
1507977	1511278	So I like that it made no pauses about that.
1511318	1516060	But then when Alan got into the actual game, all I heard was,
1516460	1517321	This is hard.
1517401	1518362	This is bullshit.
1518582	1519142	This is hard.
1519202	1520163	This game is hard.
1520203	1520583	This is hard.
1520664	1521324	I hate this game.
1521364	1522185	This is bullshit.
1522885	1523966	So apparently it's really cheap.
1524126	1526248	Why doesn't he just play it on an easier setting?
1526288	1528029	He is playing it on like easiest.
1528990	1530792	Why doesn't he just get better at games then?
1532273	1534075	Tell him he needs to go back and play Duke Nukem 3D.
1534495	1536217	I wish I could go back and play Duke Nukem 3D.
1536237	1537218	See, that's my thing.
1537378	1541201	I can't really accurately judge Duke Nukem forever until I play multiplayer.
1541542	1545746	Because that's where everything Duke Nukem... I mean, fuck single player in that game.
1545806	1546266	Seriously.
1546326	1546747	It was not...
1548248	1553832	I mean, after level 1-1 where you teehee, you have the stripper and everything, it's forgettable.
1553872	1555773	I actually really did like the single player.
1555793	1556694	But the multiplayer is awesome.
1556774	1558415	The single player levels were pretty awesome.
1558475	1561957	I even liked the Atomic Edition with all the extra stuff that they added in there.
1562438	1565780	Like, I loved the level that was basically Disneyland, which is pretty awesome.
1566160	1567761	I loved the one that was in a supermarket.
1568081	1570243	They had one at a post office and stuff like that.
1570383	1571884	It was just, those were kind of cool to me.
1572144	1574125	I kind of feel like I should just go back and play Duke Nukem 3D.
1575560	1578302	Yeah, but see, though, we tried that, though, on Remember the 360.
1578903	1581085	We all downloaded and got all excited, and it kind of sucked.
1582226	1584387	Salacious Pop is yelling at me in the chat room.
1584467	1585448	Lies and slander.
1585528	1586649	Lies and slander.
1589752	1591193	That's what it sounded like to me.
1591253	1591713	My bad.
1593755	1596918	I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.
1597138	1597418	All right.
1600881	1601601	Is he on Skype?
1601641	1603023	I could call him to defend himself.
1603463	1603763	Do it.
1604284	1604584	Hold on.
1606348	1607369	Hold on, I'll look up his number.
1608650	1609310	Isn't that sad?
1609370	1613513	I don't even know his number because we live in such a cell phone age that I don't need it.
1614434	1615575	I'm just going to call him and see what happens.
1615595	1616535	I know my husband's number.
1619838	1626722	This is just the night of random outbound phone calls, is what it is.
1626742	1627663	Let's call my mother next.
1629785	1630945	We should have sent my mother to E3.
1630985	1632046	Wouldn't that have been fun?
1632366	1632827	Yeah.
1635188	1635989	She wouldn't be able to get in.
1640333	1641393	Pick up the phone.
1641793	1643154	He's going to be all, what's this number?
1643214	1644134	And send it to voicemail.
1648475	1650456	He's screaming no in the chat room.
1652696	1653477	He's not answering.
1656778	1657438	I went to voicemail.
1657518	1657798	All right.
1659158	1659698	Live radio.
1660179	1661799	He's like, my phone is in the other room.
1667040	1667841	Oh, he's running to find it.
1667861	1668921	I'll try one more time.
1671875	1672516	One more time.
1674858	1676179	Everybody in the chat room is yelling at him.
1676779	1678261	This is the best radio ever.
1679161	1681944	This is even funnier than Shermie saying bless you when someone says this.
1681964	1684766	Apparently he was playing it on medium and I misunderstood that.
1685387	1685827	Hello.
1686067	1687429	Okay, lies and slander.
1688710	1691832	I need to turn the radio down or else we're going to have a really bad echo.
1691952	1692813	Okay, we're fine.
1692953	1693133	Sure.
1693213	1693614	Okay, hi.
1694751	1697573	Hi, tonight's the night of random phone calls where I call people.
1698234	1699315	Chatters, you don't notice.
1700335	1703898	So then you tell me about the Duke Nukem demo since I clearly misunderstood.
1706300	1720471	Once you get to the second part of the demo where it shows you some vehicle play which is fun and then you get out of your truck and the background is brown and the enemies are brown so when they pop out I actually had a hard time
1721983	1726686	And because I was playing it on medium difficulty, by the time I could get behind cover, I was dead already.
1727206	1732489	So I switched it to easy and then learned where the spawns were and then switched back to medium and I was fine.
1733029	1740193	But yeah, I think there's some work that needs to be done on the clarity of the mobs, especially since they don't.
1740928	1744329	They all kind of jumped out from behind things from out of nowhere.
1744409	1746569	Well, the game's gone gold now, so whoops.
1747270	1748670	I don't know if they're going to fix that.
1749610	1751231	Yeah, I know, right?
1751611	1753851	It feels like Duke.
1753911	1756332	They definitely captured the humor and the attitude.
1756392	1764854	But as far as some amazing first-person shooter like Bioshock, which was a completely different experience, I don't think there's anything that remarkable about it.
1766081	1779824	it's pretty much all fan service the fact that it exists means that it's going to sell but I don't think it's all that super amazing from the demo so do you think you'll invest 50 bucks or whatever in the full version on Steam?
1780704	1793247	hell no I don't care that badly that's really kind of offensive I mean obviously it's a dude bro game with the blowjob in the opening scene does the demo have multiplayer?
1794667	1795147	I don't think so
1796069	1796249	Hmm.
1796830	1797290	That's too bad.
1797550	1797810	All right.
1798451	1798751	All right.
1798791	1799852	Well, thanks for letting me bug you.
1799892	1800352	Don't be mad.
1801713	1801873	Okay.
1801913	1804855	But I wanted you to be able to accurately represent and defend yourself.
1804915	1806556	I would never want to misstate your opinions.
1807056	1807296	Yes.
1807497	1807777	All right.
1808117	1808357	Bye.
1808377	1808537	Okay.
1808697	1808877	Bye.
1809218	1809398	Bye.
1811279	1812100	Who should we call next?
1812120	1813080	All right.
1813461	1813761	No, no.
1813781	1814741	We've got the rest of the show to do.
1815042	1815222	Okay.
1815482	1816242	We've got to get into news.
1816302	1817363	That's it for our Gaming Weeks.
1817743	1818444	Quick housekeeping.
1818544	1820085	Again, I just want to clarify the schedule.
1820965	1823347	There will be no OLR next Sunday.
1823687	1826329	There will be two episodes of OLR on the feed this week.
1826649	1827890	Tuesday night, Wednesday night.
1828190	1834274	Join us on our new Ustream channel, 7 o'clock Pacific, with special correspondent Bobby Blackwolf.
1834374	1835215	Here's the great news.
1835335	1840819	I don't think this really affects anyone listening to this show, but he's also going to be posting the shows on his feed, which I think is really cool.
1842060	1847203	So that way if you, I don't know why you would be listening right now and you're not subscribed to our show, but okay, let's say you're not.
1847463	1848904	You can also get them from Bobby's feed.
1848924	1850065	So they're going to be in both places.
1850485	1852906	for maximum exposure.
1853826	1858407	I'm getting tweeted pictures, by the way, right now from Miklatov, who I guess went to the convention center earlier.
1858787	1863229	And I guess, you know, a couple days before the show, you can just kind of walk right on in there and walk around.
1863269	1870110	He's not in the actual exhibition halls, but let's see, there's a giant ad for Assassin's Creed Revelations.
1870971	1871891	Giant ad for that.
1872791	1876332	A little picture of the lobby that shows nothing really notable.
1876552	1879373	Can't really see in the room there and they won't let him up the stairs, I'm sure.
1879813	1899961	and then it looks like what they're advertising on the entryway is Rage which is supposed to be that big new shooter which is going to have a whole new engine that people are going to adapt kind of like what Unreal brought to the table and there's these little gross little aliens crawling all over the entry plaza for Rage so you can expect that that game is going to have a big presence in E3
1901846	1902306	So there you go.
1903387	1908611	No OLR next Sunday because DarkSakura and I will be at Disneyland with Bobby.
1908691	1910913	Actually we won't be there Sunday but we'll be driving back.
1911493	1912334	And there will be a Dan.
1913052	1913792	There will be a Dan.
1913973	1914633	There will be a Dan.
1914673	1917115	Dan will be here for the Tuesday-Wednesday shows, too.
1917135	1917375	Yes.
1917835	1920857	Because Loki, unfortunately, will only be able to join us by phone.
1920877	1921537	I'll see what I can do.
1921978	1923879	He might try to pull some strings and join us live.
1923899	1924559	That would be amazing.
1924879	1925540	We'll see what happens.
1926781	1927541	You can call me.
1928682	1930703	I can do it over Skype or something like that.
1931684	1932324	All right.
1932344	1933425	From 8 o'clock on.
1933825	1936327	We need at least the Nintendo Press Conference feedback.
1936347	1938188	That's everybody wants out of Loki.
1938228	1938368	I agree.
1938648	1941210	Wednesday, maybe not Wednesday, but...
1941830	1944252	Tuesday would be fun because then that would be after all the press conferences.
1944993	1945433	There you go.
1946374	1946634	All right.
1947435	1950578	Anyhow, let's move on with gaming news because we've got a lot to cover tonight.
1950638	1954281	It's not just E3, but of course, of course, E3 rumors are going to start it.
1954321	1954641	Come on.
1954701	1955682	It's what everybody's talking about.
1956203	1957344	Let's start us off, Loki.
1957944	1959326	Yes, and I don't know.
1960487	1960847	I don't know.
1962208	1962408	VitaPita
1986270	1992655	Yes, and so, well, here's what evidence they have for that.
1992955	2002403	One, there was a leaked or apparently leaked picture of a brochure showing the system with the PS Vita image on there.
2003003	2005765	And, you know, whereas most people might say, oh, that might be Photoshopped.
2006106	2008648	Well, there's at least some other evidence to go along with that.
2009468	2013852	Oh, there's actually a few pictures of that, so that's kind of interesting.
2014753	2026063	Also, apparently, there was a domain for developers that actually had a PS Vita for it.
2026163	2028765	It's the Sony dev site.
2029526	2030286	They had that.
2031107	2039014	And then also, apparently, there's text for the PlayStation Vita website.
2039895	2044097	Hidden away in the code for the E3 site for Sony.
2046058	2047478	I gotta say that that's probably true.
2049199	2060144	If it's hidden away in their code on their website, and it's also on their dev site, and it's also in this brochure, it's probably... Makes me feel great about the security of Sony in the future, by the way.
2060726	2077735	um I also agree it's it's probably the right name it makes sense uh it's you know they're trying to go for that catchy thing uh also just the fact that do you guys remember last E3 everything got spoiled everything no or was it two years ago
2077935	2078955	Yeah, spoiled by them.
2079275	2081496	Remember with the PSP Go?
2082176	2082877	No, not just that.
2082917	2086258	There was one year where every big announcement that they were going to make was spoiled.
2086318	2098722	And I remember he got up on stage and when he showed the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV, it must have been two years ago, he got up on stage and showed the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV and everybody thought he had fucked up and meant to say XIII too, but no, it was actually XIV.
2099042	2102603	And then he goes, hey, there's one we kept from you.
2102643	2104804	I remember that vividly in my mind.
2105244	2106985	The rest of that press conference had been spoiled.
2107907	2110568	Yeah, glad you kept that one from us.
2111948	2113709	We wish you had kept it away from us forever.
2113729	2115029	You need to keep it a little bit longer.
2115869	2120910	Some other cool information regarding the NGP, or Vita, I guess we'll call it Vita.
2122371	2126372	It's going to be fully backwards compatible with all PSP games that are on the PlayStation Network.
2126432	2128092	Obviously, it's not going to have a UMD drive.
2129093	2132493	It will also offer smoothing and dual analog support.
2132574	2134134	So, for example, you know, games like
2134554	2150906	Resistance Retribution, how they had the DualShock 3 controller support if you played that with the PSP Go or I believe through the Resistance... I forget what they called that.
2153780	2155081	Duel Shock 3 Support
2171209	2180635	Um, I'm sorry, I'm late to the party and that's fine, I'm actually waiting to hear a lot of this from Sony's mouth tomorrow, but, um, this thing doesn't have a UMD drive?
2180915	2181435	It doesn't have any?
2181756	2182836	It doesn't have any drive.
2182916	2188480	It has two physical, like, SD cards, proprietary, some sort of storage card.
2188820	2194764	Okay, okay, so there's some, I was like, they didn't learn from the go that people don't want to download anything?
2194784	2196785	No, it's like a cartridge, some sort of storage card.
2197125	2215618	but yeah the rumor was that there was no onboard storage at all for this thing you have to buy your own like memory cards or something like that but that each game would have its own you know card and there'd be space on there for download content and whatnot TigerClaw in our chatroom says they should have called it PS Vivo which is Spanish for live
2216879	2217940	Might be an okay name.
2218360	2221642	It's just going to be PSV is what's going to end up happening.
2221662	2227525	Yeah, PSV, and I think it's Vita for this is vital for you to have because it has everything.
2227625	2230206	And that's Sony's little tagline, it only does everything.
2230547	2233708	And to be fair, it was the strength of the PSP.
2233848	2235149	It did online.
2235449	2237470	It's just like they have the Vio.
2237971	2239852	Yeah, I would believe Vita.
2239892	2241332	I think it's vital.
2242873	2244574	It's vital for all gamers to have this.
2244694	2245855	I'm sticking with Verklent.
2246655	2248656	Because that's how anyone who buys one will feel.
2248796	2255978	And apparently, they've been on the record saying that they've learned from their mistakes with the PSP.
2256679	2260380	And they're going to make sure they don't make them again with the Vita.
2261080	2262961	They're basically saying, we wanted to...
2263681	2272565	Our biggest mistake, I would say, with the PSP was that we were just so happy to provide the PS2 gaming on the go that we kind of stopped there.
2272965	2275906	This is what we want to do with the NGP, or Vita.
2276706	2283669	Besides the great graphics and CPU, think on what the interface could put in to make gameplay reality stand out.
2284409	2285070	Really stand out.
2285390	2287591	You know, something that you cannot even do on the PS3.
2288651	2295154	And yeah, that makes sense with the rear touch and the augmented reality stuff and touchscreen and all that stuff.
2295615	2298036	But I think it's almost too much.
2299837	2303918	They have some games that are kind of showing off that rear touch thing.
2305639	2305959	I don't know.
2306160	2308721	It's a little weird to me, but we'll see.
2309622	2318888	And I gotta be honest, you know, I was kind of, you know, I'm the one to kind of buy every console when it comes out and stuff, but, you know, I'm probably actually not gonna buy one of these.
2319028	2322370	And the reason why is they were showing off some of the games that they have at launch or whatever.
2322670	2326313	They have a Wipeout game, and they have... Of course, Ridge Racer.
2326693	2328054	They have Uncharted, no Ridge Racer.
2329655	2329975	Yet.
2330275	2332577	And some other games like Super Stardust and stuff like that, but...
2334002	2335183	I'm not a fan of Uncharted.
2335403	2336745	I don't really care about Wipeout.
2336965	2342530	So to me, it's almost like, hey, look, it's the 3DS lineup again.
2343030	2344352	No, I'm not going to do this.
2344512	2345733	You're not a fan of Uncharted.
2346313	2346814	Blasphemer.
2347194	2347715	Whatever.
2348315	2350878	I want to look at the chat room here with some of the comments about the name.
2351818	2357704	Jvmon in our chat room says, Vita equals life, PlayStation life, like you live a PlayStation life.
2357884	2358164	I don't know.
2358184	2359826	Also, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, We knew that joke was coming.
2376331	2377152	FusionVault and FusionSentiment
2403775	2410479	They are specified in the little trademark as entertainment services, namely providing an online computer game.
2410859	2416283	So there must be some type of Fusion series coming out for either Xbox Live Arcade.
2416383	2417864	God, it better not be Fusion Frenzy.
2417904	2419004	I fucking hate Fusion Frenzy.
2419024	2420045	No, it's not Fusion Frenzy.
2420065	2421166	That was a Hudson thing anyway.
2421186	2423507	It was never Microsoft-centric.
2423827	2427870	Yeah, because they couldn't swap developers on Microsoft games.
2427990	2435695	Okay, but like, if Microsoft was gonna buy a franchise like Fusion Frenzy, which I don't think, I mean, I realize Hudson in the U.S.
2435735	2442339	kind of closed, but I believe they still have a Japanese presence, so... Well, just because they... Why would you buy the Fusion Frenzy series?
2442379	2443879	That last game was awful!
2444020	2450463	And on top of that, you know, it's like Hudson was responsible for the Mario Party games, and those weren't terrible.
2450864	2454566	It's just like, for the 360, like, ahhh, or even the original Xbox...
2455326	2471324	and let's just not give a shit on this problem with all due respect to people that work at Hudson the biggest issue with Hudson is that they've had some really big hits and some huge misses like just wow wow like Bomberman Zero was a Hudson game if I'm not mistaken correct
2471824	2496125	Yeah Fusion Frenzy 2 I think all Bomberman games have been Hudson Because Hudson created Bomberman Correct But when they hit, they hit pretty well DECA Sports actually wasn't a bad game It was a nice little expansion of Wii Sports The Bomberman Xbox Live Arcade thing was great It delivered exactly what people wanted out of a Bomberman game
2497372	2499374	But anyway, how did we get from Fusion to Bomberman?
2499414	2502057	Oh yeah, that stinking Fusion frenzy.
2502077	2503699	Yeah, you know what the problem with Hudson is?
2503719	2504620	They're owned by Konami.
2505340	2507603	I wonder if it's not their answer to pixel junk.
2507863	2508904	That's where my mind goes.
2509104	2512948	Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be like they're gonna go- Why do they need to even answer that?
2513148	2513889	I mean, seriously.
2514229	2515851	Because it's done well for Sony.
2515871	2516432	So what?
2516912	2519413	So, good, a game has done well for Sony.
2519613	2520874	Why do they need to answer that?
2520894	2523175	They have plenty of good games on Xbox Live Arcade.
2523415	2530219	Hell, there's good games coming out every week on Xbox Live Arcade versus the PlayStation Network, which doesn't get everything each week.
2531500	2535001	GameGuru in our chat says, I think Microsoft owns the Fusion Frenzy license.
2535061	2539584	Okay, fine, but really, I really don't think these games have anything to do with Fusion Frenzy.
2539904	2541545	That last game killed the series.
2542325	2543846	Let it die.
2543986	2545867	I don't think this is it.
2546227	2547189	I mean, I don't know.
2547709	2550213	It could be a Kinect thing.
2550233	2553096	I think it's just going to be minigame garbage.
2553157	2554358	Unfortunately, that's where my mind goes.
2554418	2556201	But it's just a freaking name.
2556241	2558324	It could also be the best game we've ever seen.
2558444	2559325	I mean, we just don't know.
2559365	2559946	They're names.
2560146	2562589	I'm going to make the best game ever and call it freaking garbage.
2564091	2565812	That's going to be awesome.
2566233	2567333	And you play a garbage man.
2567373	2569035	No, you don't.
2570035	2571716	Case in point, Super Meat Boy.
2573698	2578061	Based on the name and the box art, I was like, this game looks stupid.
2578601	2580182	This game looks so stupid.
2580663	2583004	And then I played it and I'm like, oh my god, this game's amazing.
2583645	2586507	So, you know, names do not mean everything.
2586627	2590770	Anyway, let's get to some other... Speaking of names, some other registrations.
2591590	2592071	Domains.
2593011	2607387	Apparently some internet domain names that have been registered Fable The Journey New Fable game or possibly Fable Xbox Live or possibly Fable Connect Fable Connect This is what Milo turned into I'm thinking it's this
2608223	2630494	all that whole like you can have him set down in the stream and you can hold them pieces of paper interacting with people Fable the Journey is what happened to Milo I don't even think it's that far I think it's just Fable with some connectivity I guess that would be Fable 4 I've abandoned the whole Fable series anyway so to hell with it I don't even care what it is
2631594	2634296	All right, Connect Fun Labs is another one.
2634316	2636037	That was already leaked, though, in an earlier thing.
2636597	2638719	Dance Central 2, which, I mean, really?
2638739	2638999	Duh.
2639299	2640240	Duh, really?
2641000	2642221	Connect Sports Season 2.
2642901	2643241	Duh.
2643642	2645262	Yeah, also pretty much a duh.
2646403	2649085	The sequels to our two most successful Kinect titles?
2649305	2649685	Never!
2650625	2651126	Exactly.
2651566	2658309	Again, it's really all about, okay, what is the Kinect going to give us that isn't part of the Wii?
2658470	2660731	I'm really interested in what this whole Kinect Star Wars thing is.
2661691	2665553	Because remember, they had teased that last year and we got nothing.
2665834	2668415	Well, this is the year we need to see what Kinect Star Wars is all about.
2670612	2674334	All LucasArts got, you know, they have right now is just the Old Republic.
2674814	2675094	That's it.
2675114	2677935	They have nothing else slated to come out that they've announced.
2680597	2681197	All right.
2681377	2683378	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2683478	2686559	Randy in our chatroom says, Hold hands in Fable with Kinect.
2687040	2689221	What the hell was that hand-holding thing anyway?
2689261	2690201	Like, it didn't make sense.
2690921	2692342	Just say, follow me.
2692402	2697324	Well, for escorting the girl and stuff, it made sense, but did you really have to be able to hold hands and run everybody through town?
2698045	2698865	It's just weird.
2699358	2699859	Ico did it.
2701280	2703222	But Ico, she was Ico.
2704063	2704884	All right, moving on.
2705644	2707847	One of the press conferences already happened, right, DarkSakura?
2708027	2708627	Konami.
2709768	2711530	We had some announcements from Konami.
2711590	2718497	We had the Metal Gear Solid HD collection that has Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.
2719418	2720699	But the original one is not in it.
2720719	2722161	Okay.
2724781	2725522	Twin Snakes, though.
2725562	2727743	I mean, that should have been in there.
2727763	2728884	They've already remade it once.
2729684	2735528	But anyway, it's going to be available on the PS3 and Xbox and will support 1080p.
2736809	2739910	And on the PS3, there is a transferring feature.
2740751	2742732	Well, I guess transferring, I should say.
2742792	2743753	It must have been misspelled.
2744073	2745854	No, I think they are misspelling it on purpose.
2745974	2746094	Really?
2746114	2747255	It's their little... Transfaring?
2747275	2748456	Transfaring, yeah.
2748656	2748916	Yeah.
2749497	2752859	Where you can transfer your Peace Walker game from your PSP to your PS3.
2753039	2755821	I like how they pronounce Million Merion.
2756361	2760704	You can transfer your game from the PS3 to the PSP.
2760964	2772212	There's also a Zone of the Enders HD collection, so it has Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders 2, and not much else is said about that except that they're thinking it'll be out in 2012, and it'll be a PS3 and Xbox 360.
2774414	2776418	and it will also have Transfaring.
2778282	2778763	Much better.
2780146	2782952	But there wasn't a Zone of the Enders game on the PSP.
2783935	2783955	I...
2786023	2788585	More importantly than all of that, there's going to be a Silent Hill collection.
2790566	2794548	Which is Silent Hill 2 and 3 and it's just basically touched up to look good in HD.
2795068	2800010	And it doesn't say what it's going to be on, although my assumption would be, well, PS3 and Xbox 360.
2800411	2802432	Maybe you can trans-fart there too.
2802632	2803072	I don't know.
2803452	2804693	I'm going to call it trans-fart.
2806534	2810736	So that I can think of pooting noises whenever you do your trans-farting.
2811072	2815696	Well, here's the thing, the transfarring stuff... Will Psycho Mantis read my transfarted data?
2816536	2826545	It's not really a good feature anyways, because the only game you can use that for would be the PSP port, and Peace Walker is the only game.
2826865	2833130	And I'm assuming you have to have the original game for that as well, so... I don't know, it's kind of weird.
2834051	2838314	It does feel like a lot of wasted resources on something no one's going to use, correct?
2838835	2838995	Yeah.
2839015	2839115	Yeah.
2839870	2853164	and what I would think would be cool is that for those of us who have older PS3s it would be cool if there could be some way to transfer your save file but other than that, you know that would be a pipe dream
2855057	2855838	Yeah, I don't know.
2883014	2883795	and her jaw dropped.
2883835	2885877	Like, I can't even control what's going on on the stage right now.
2886217	2887138	Is the show a hot mess?
2887538	2891342	Yeah, there was the year that they showed Rock Revolution and they failed the song on stage.
2891902	2894404	And then they had, what, last year, the whole Lucha Libre thing.
2894444	2895626	Wasn't that part of their thing?
2895706	2898728	And then, like, it was just like, what in the hell is going on on the stage right now?
2898848	2902692	And the whole, what was it, the one Marion Troops and...
2903312	2905194	But no, the whole thing was pre-recorded.
2932719	2954703	and it was a pre-recorded slickly produced video reel it was very reminiscent of for those that have seen the Konami booth at E3 they always have a giant television well last year they remodeled it and I can't remember if they have the giant TV anymore but at least for the last few years before that they had a giant television that would cycle through all the trailers and people would kind of sit and watch it was very reminiscent of this is the video that's going to play on the giant TV all E3
2958305	2959246	Which I found interesting.
2959286	2959727	You know what?
2959847	2967433	Hey, it was an interesting way for them to do it, and they got their message out there and didn't really get made fun of, and there's been a lot of hypes for the products.
2967793	2974718	I found it very interesting that they did it that way, in part probably, so that it was very scripted and would not fall apart.
2974859	2976520	Alright, here's my complaint.
2976760	2979822	And besides what Jamie's going to talk about here in a second...
2980663	2982144	Really, is this all you've got?
2982284	2984404	You've got remakes of your old shit.
2984925	2985525	Is that it?
2985585	2986925	This is what you've worked hard on?
2986945	2992187	Is taking assets from an old game and sprucing them up.
2992527	2994308	Hey, no, you're not really playing a new game.
2994328	2999030	We're just taking the old game, freshening it up a bit, and pumping it back into your console.
2999050	3001991	Kojima did come out to talk about a new interface.
3002031	3004672	Oh, about his new engine for a game that he has no game for.
3005272	3005552	Well...
3006432	3024763	Here's the thing, this is tricky though, because maybe it's a game they're going to announce But because of this whole pre-3 thing, they didn't Please, just like, you know, they would announce it anyways if they were going to have something to announce Because, I mean, seriously, where's, you know, Metal Gear Rising?
3025003	3031527	Oh, they didn't mention that, it's still coming, you know, next year Even though they mentioned it two years ago, well, last year I guess
3031767	3056677	yay thank you to the four chatters that all found that at once for me the Oprah bees gif have you seen it Loki um I'm afraid I have not seen my favorite fucking thing ever wait hold on oh there's a YouTube Ziba bless your heart ultimate Oprah's ultimate favorite things here we go oh I made a full screen here we go this is for you too she's
3061010	3065911	They're opening the box and... Bees!
3072612	3075113	And they're playing the I'm a bee in the background.
3078753	3081994	And this is what we were expecting Konami's press conference to be this year.
3083274	3083874	That's great.
3084595	3085135	Bees!
3085815	3086455	That's awesome.
3090219	3090599	Book of Memories
3115546	3116046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3142919	3145422	Oh, you wanted something for you guys.
3146022	3147744	Oh, sorry, we don't have anything for you.
3147784	3150007	We're telling you this because we know you'll import it anyway.
3150147	3153250	We don't even have Glee for you, which is fine.
3153510	3155492	We don't need to carry Revolution Glee.
3157054	3162500	Did they announce some of that stuff kind of just in written form only, like a new DDR game is coming out too?
3162620	3165403	Like it wasn't really in the video, but they did put out a little paper on it?
3165720	3168622	Well, you know, I didn't see a DDR game on there.
3169302	3173585	All I saw was X3, the arcade machine, and that's it.
3175186	3179129	And yeah, it's coming out in Japan, so that does not count, I'm afraid.
3179389	3180089	I'm sorry.
3181330	3185594	So really, what they're spending their time on doing is taking old shit and making it new again.
3185694	3187395	Or not even making it new, making it prettier.
3188977	3189257	Great.
3189797	3190278	Good job.
3190438	3191439	You know who can get away with that?
3191699	3192560	Sony can get away with that.
3192580	3193000	Because you know why?
3193020	3195062	Because they put out new shit on top of that.
3195742	3200406	Again, Loki, I think it's too early to really say that.
3200486	3203669	Because next week, we have a new Nintendo console coming out.
3203729	3204190	You know...
3205791	3211214	Oh, I'm shaking, waiting for the new Elebits game that's going to come out.
3212795	3217238	And maybe another DECA sports game, because you know there'll be another DECA sports game.
3217318	3217979	I'm done with you.
3219299	3221960	Deck of Sports and Elebits maybe.
3222200	3225321	And what other crap do they put out whenever there's a new console?
3226922	3227963	Let me think here.
3229103	3231624	They don't put out Elebits every time there's a new console.
3231644	3233125	That happened once on the Wii.
3233485	3235285	Yeah, but they're going to totally bring it over.
3235585	3236006	You know it.
3236286	3237066	I don't think they will.
3237346	3238867	You just scared Shermie.
3239607	3241268	You just made Shermie leave the room in disgust.
3241288	3242908	I believe that's another Hudson title too.
3243248	3246070	She's probably going to go take a shit in the hall because of your outburst.
3247590	3249192	Thank you for making my cat poop!
3249452	3252556	Alright, can we move on with another story, please?
3252596	3252996	I guess.
3253457	3261485	I'm just saying, it's... It was not disappointing because I kind of expected this little out of them.
3262366	3264488	You know, I was hoping they would surprise me, but...
3265560	3267782	They might still... No, they're not.
3268283	3268784	Come on.
3268824	3270485	This is Konami we're talking about here.
3270826	3272087	They are never going to surprise us.
3272207	3274550	They're going to just come out with... I almost want to bet money on this.
3274910	3278114	I almost want to bet money on this, but I'm not going to because I'm broke.
3279095	3281117	And I'm going to Disneyland this week and I need my money.
3282614	3283274	Alright, fine.
3283374	3284395	Let's talk about something else.
3285035	3288816	There's a rumor that Microsoft's going to be announcing a TV service at E3.
3289216	3293398	Basically, kind of this whole rumored IPTV thing.
3293438	3299200	Well, now they're going to take it a step further and basically become their own service.
3299400	3303722	So, instead of having a dish or something like that, you could have whatever we're going to call it.
3304042	3307503	I believe Xbox Live Diamond, they're saying, is what it's going to be.
3307903	3311765	Which is funny, because I remember back in the day having the Diamond card, which gave me
3312385	3313806	Nothing.
3315106	3317427	Didn't it give you discounts at Quiznos for a month?
3317827	3318528	Something like that.
3318548	3323210	Free upgrade of a 6-inch sub to a foot long?
3323290	3325971	That was what Xbox Diamond was good for?
3326011	3329773	It was the equivalent of those little fundraising cards that you get.
3329793	3330673	Entertainment books.
3330953	3331673	No, not even that.
3331713	3332874	Not even the entertainment book.
3332894	3339076	But you know those little fundraising cards that you get that it's like, oh, this is for all the local businesses.
3339096	3342137	10% off of a Subway sandwich.
3342557	3343157	Foursquare?
3343958	3344978	No, not Foursquare.
3345418	3346679	Predating all of that.
3347239	3351480	I know it's hard to think of a time that Foursquare didn't exist.
3351560	3353381	All I can think of is the entertainment books, honestly.
3353922	3358634	They'd sell them for like $35 and all it was was like, buy one, get one free.
3358654	3359657	We sold those and banned.
3359677	3361422	It's like, I'm never going to use all this.
3362984	3367428	Back before there was Groupon, there was Entertainment Books.
3368408	3371371	Yes, so they're saying that it's going to be for an additional monthly fee.
3371391	3373932	It's basically going to be like a virtual cable operator.
3376434	3381418	So not really too much that we know, or if it's even going to be announced.
3381658	3388684	It would be kind of neat, because honestly, cable's fucking expensive, so if I can get something decent for cheaper...
3389246	3390908	Okay, but correct me if I'm wrong.
3391108	3402421	If net neutrality, this whole thing about the websites will soon be able to block whatever, or the, I'm sorry, internet providers will soon be able to block whatever they want goes through, do you think Comcast is going to have this?
3402441	3403603	They'll just be like, oh, block.
3405265	3408807	Unless Microsoft has somehow bought in to the providers.
3408867	3410807	And they kind of have done this with ESPN.
3411108	3415429	Like when you connect to the ESPN, it shows in the corner when I connect, it says brought to you by Comcast.
3415709	3418291	Like it knows what you're connecting to them through.
3418951	3419531	It's possible.
3420031	3425614	So either there's going to be an agreement or this little TV network that they're doing might be...
3426935	3428156	and their own set of channels.
3428456	3432380	It's not going to be tied to regular TV.
3432620	3442410	Do you remember about a year ago it had come out that before Conan signed the deal with TBS he had entertained the notion about doing a nightly show on Xbox Live?
3442590	3443270	That would have been awesome.
3443591	3448756	And that's why I think there's a lot of truth to this because I think Microsoft's been trying to build this for some time.
3450362	3456865	and they have a similar service in UK although granted it's not their own channel so I don't know where it's going to fall.
3457226	3465630	I think there absolutely will be at least one new Microsoft channel in this and of course MSNBC.
3467972	3468292	DarkSakura,
3493655	3504490	Other news about other things going on at E3 Q Games is going to be showing three titles at E3 Please note that this is not the same thing as Q Entertainment
3505891	3532013	I had actually made that mistake a little earlier on I thought this was about Q Entertainment but no Q Games is the company that makes like PixelJunk Shooter and PixelJunk they make all those games they're apparently they have like a preview online for one other PixelJunk game and it was a little bit weird that title it was PixelJunk Lifelike they had done a little preview of that apparently they are going to do two unannounced projects at E3 could they be more PixelJunk games
3534563	3561985	seems to be a lot of what they do now I bet one of them will be but one of them might be something a little new maybe for another console or something like that IDK but not the same as Q Entertainment who makes Luminous and you know Rez and all that Child of Eden Mizuguchi Studio different so there you go well we would move on to another story but DarkSakura left the studio so let me just yell at Loki some more
3563740	3564420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3580549	3581430	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3598949	3604336	Basically, you can control your pets, and you can breed them and share them.
3604376	3607279	The Xbox 360 version will have Kinect capabilities.
3607960	3612546	You can control the Sims and their pets with voice commands.
3613447	3615008	And then, it's like...
3615649	3616210	Make Out!
3616490	3617290	And then they'll make out.
3618511	3619052	That type of thing.
3619812	3625117	But pets, for the 3DS, will have a pedometer so you get more karma points the more that you walk.
3625257	3626878	And you can use it to buy in-game items.
3627378	3631341	And then with the Street Pass, you can get pets to other pets owners.
3632402	3633884	So, um, there you go.
3634024	3640852	I'm just hoping that it, I would rather that for the PC one that it works a lot more like the old Pets expansion did.
3640872	3647019	You know, you have, you can build your dog house and you can have your cat and you have to clean up your cat's poo and that type of thing.
3647460	3648521	I'd make a big fat Shermie.
3649422	3650263	Sounds like fun.
3651195	3657084	Well, Sims is for people who don't want to play Second Life, but, you know, it's a lot more fun.
3657284	3657665	I don't know.
3657985	3660208	Maybe... They want to play Second Life by themselves.
3660248	3662712	But, like, now I have to get Generations if I want to play this one.
3662852	3663693	It's RPM.
3663753	3664935	It's Roleplay Masturbation.
3666097	3666738	It's self-serving.
3667899	3668600	I'm kidding.
3668941	3671764	The Sims is still the best selling PC game ever, right?
3671784	3672265	Pretty much.
3673106	3674167	I don't even think WoW beat it.
3674748	3675889	So, there you go.
3676289	3678132	Alright, let's travel the world and look at some release dates.
3678492	3682196	If you don't want to get The Sims, maybe there's something else coming out to a store near you very soon.
3683057	3685558	This week there's actually quite a few things coming out.
3685639	3686399	It's just kind of nice.
3687559	3688960	We'll start things off.
3689400	3691521	Infamous 2 on the PlayStation 3.
3691902	3693142	That's going to be coming out this week.
3694163	3700446	Red Faction Armageddon coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3702507	3702947	Let's see.
3703127	3704248	Also this week...
3707032	3730201	Operation Flashpoint Red River that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC as well let's see here I really wish these lists would load up faster that's pretty much the big releases this week the rest is just crap I'll leave it at that
3731564	3733085	Well, you got these games and a bunch of crap.
3733205	3734306	That's what's coming out this week.
3734366	3742411	Yeah, I mean, I think they have like a fucking triple pack for Ben 10 or some garbage like that.
3742471	3745233	If that's your thing, then cool.
3747274	3748715	What other garbage do they have here?
3749316	3751737	Duke Nukem Critical Mass, but that's not actually coming out at that time.
3752118	3752858	Oh, Green Lantern.
3752938	3756200	Of course, there's a movie tie-in game for that, which I'm sure will be just wonderful.
3756581	3758722	That's on PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.
3762525	3766167	Oh, and DS and 3DS because that's a good 3DS title right there.
3770849	3771110	Oh, yeah.
3771330	3775212	And then I forgot because this is actually about a week from today.
3776133	3778654	WePlayMotion will be coming out for Nintendo.
3778974	3780495	This is the innovative content that they have.
3780515	3782696	Oh, hey, WePlay sold really well.
3782736	3783657	Let's make another one of those.
3784057	3788300	So that will be coming out for Nintendo with a black Wii Remote Plus.
3790021	3790321	Awesome.
3791883	3795326	All right, moving on to Japanese release dates.
3795406	3796326	What's coming out over there?
3796667	3800169	On the Xbox 360 on June 9th, the Gears of War Twin Pack.
3800289	3804012	It's a Platinum Collection now, so a little bit of a price reduction for those of you guys in Japan.
3804152	3813139	Also, Phantom Breaker in a limited edition, Red Faction Armageddon, and Riot Act 2 goes into the Platinum Collection, so that is also getting a price reduction.
3814000	3816302	Riot Act 2 is Crackdown.
3816682	3817603	What's their version of Crackdown?
3819364	3840458	moving on to other consoles such as the PlayStation 3 Red Faction Armageddon there as well Ryu Ga Gotoku comes out of the end is what that's called that is coming out on the 9th from Sega this is a Yakuza zombie game yeah that looks pretty cool could be interesting are they bringing that out over here?
3841551	3841992	I don't know.
3843052	3843973	It's not been announced yet.
3844234	3848457	So Yakuza Zombies, maybe that's something you'll see at E3 next week, a localized version of that.
3849058	3850939	On the Nintendo Wii, nothing.
3851320	3855143	On the 3DS though, Fish On comes out this week.
3855363	3857005	You guessed it, it's a fishing game.
3857545	3858426	And it's 3D.
3859507	3859887	Yay.
3860368	3862129	I would have never guessed it's a fishing game.
3863090	3875335	and lastly on the Sony PSP really not a lot this week there's another Evangelion limited edition thing it's a Pachi game tabashi so I'm thinking that is what another pachinko Evangelion game
3876912	3878013	I'm looking at the screenshots.
3878373	3880494	Yeah, it's like a little slot machine.
3880514	3881454	Little gambling games.
3881915	3882695	Little mini games.
3882955	3883776	Gambling slots.
3884196	3887637	Because there's a revamped Evangelion series out.
3888018	3892040	So, of course, it's been getting a big side product reboot.
3892500	3893100	So, there you go.
3893200	3893480	That's it.
3893500	3894521	Does it for your Japanese releases.
3895458	3896559	Forever and ever.
3922912	3924053	Tell me, Loki, what's going on?
3924853	3926635	What's going on?
3943968	3946510	What's going on as we have rumors about the Wii successor?
3948791	3950692	This is stuff that we've all kind of heard about before.
3951873	3958998	This is coming from Nikkei, and this is basically the same publication that also predicted the DSi.
3959038	3960519	The DSi XL, the 3DS.
3961500	3966123	Now they're predicting stuff for the new Wii console or new Nintendo console.
3967264	3971126	Apparently, they are saying that it's coming out on the second half of 2012.
3971366	3973328	Obviously, fourth quarter.
3973468	3973828	Makes sense.
3974730	3979986	and that it will also have the 6-inch touchscreen on the controller.
3981058	3983780	Yeah, basically repeating what everybody else has been saying.
3984901	3990966	And also, apparently, they're supposed to be having some sort of camera on the actual controller as well.
3990986	4004356	They're saying that the company OmniVision, who's worked with Apple on its iPhone, supplying them with cameras, is also apparently supplying Nintendo with cameras as well.
4004576	4007378	So, interestingly.
4009144	4009985	That they're going to do that.
4012707	4016470	And there was one other rumor that didn't make our show roll because it was very, very, very last minute.
4016590	4024015	But the rumor is that Nintendo's next console might be called Nintendo.
4026497	4027218	That's right.
4027798	4029860	That's how much effort they're putting into their console.
4030200	4031461	They don't even want to fucking name it.
4032865	4033325	You know what?
4033525	4035246	I actually don't think it's that terrible of a name.
4035506	4039508	I think there was a rumor that the Wii was going to be called that, that it's just the Nintendo.
4040408	4042409	That whole reboot idea.
4042709	4051892	I actually don't think it's a terrible idea, because if you go back to when all we had was the Nintendo, it was like, hey, you want to come over to my house and play Nintendo?
4052292	4052532	It became...
4054733	4056534	Like a verb, you know what I mean?
4056654	4059955	Like Xeroxing, Kleenex, one of those types of things.
4060095	4066077	So calling it the Nintendo Nintendo, I don't think it's a terrible name.
4067018	4069519	I can see like Nintendo HD or something like that.
4071299	4075541	I think most people's reaction will be, oh, okay, but I don't think you can say that's a bad name.
4077414	4099094	to be fair, the original Nintendo was really called the Nintendo Entertainment System so if they're calling this just the Nintendo, it is a new name but I actually don't believe it I think because to call the system your company when you're trying to also launch a 3DS thing side by side I actually don't buy it
4100402	4106484	I would give more cred to Nintendo HD or Nintendo with a very small suffix to it.
4110045	4110385	Let's see.
4110506	4113587	Randy in our chatroom says, not Nintendo, THE Nintendo.
4114067	4116147	Ranma says, the next console called Nintendo.
4116187	4117768	I fucking called that two weeks ago.
4118028	4120289	Dude, you gotta wait till Tuesday before you get to parade that.
4120829	4140241	Salacious Pop to play Nintendo is still relevant vernacular in my opinion so if they want to make a play on that it's not that surprising that's kind of where I'm at my mom still calls it all Nintendo when I showed her Mortal Kombat she was like oh you're gonna fire up the Nintendo okay maybe not like that but you know it's all the same to her
4141866	4143067	So, we'll see.
4144108	4147891	Anyhow, one other story I want to get to before we get to the classic game of the week.
4147911	4148692	And this is important.
4148992	4154416	This has to do with, of course, fundraising efforts that are still going on for Japanese tsunami relief.
4154757	4156838	Guys, it doesn't fix itself overnight.
4157599	4161002	This fundraising effort is going to go on for years and years.
4161042	4168588	You know, again, not to bring up really bad memories of the past, but when Hurricane Katrina happened, that took years to clean up.
4168648	4169549	And some would argue...
4170049	4170889	Thank you for watching.
4170909	4171470	See you next time.
4186998	4188419	The track list was announced this week.
4188459	4189239	That's the new news.
4189779	4192960	Just going over some of the cool things that are going to be on here.
4193020	4194861	There's original songs here.
4195561	4198001	Akira Yamaoka has a song called Ex-Animo.
4199302	4202863	Koji Kondo has a Super Mario medley on two pianos.
4203683	4208885	Mitsuzo Suzuki, Play For You, Tommy Tallarico, Greater Lights.
4208965	4212606	So it's not just folks in Japan, but it's Western composers as well.
4213728	4219389	Did you watch the thing that Akira Yamaoka was talking about?
4220188	4221709	I did not watch the video.
4221829	4224350	I do have it here, but did you watch it?
4224430	4224830	Yes, I did.
4224910	4225430	What did you think?
4225930	4226351	Really good.
4226811	4227531	What was in it?
4228271	4239356	Just talking about working with people from all over the world that worked in the industry specifically related to music and getting some of the best names out there and that everything was going towards Japan Relief.
4239396	4248580	It was really just thanking people involved and thanking people to buy it and saying, hey, for all of you following us, we recognize we have a world audience and that type of thing.
4248960	4249261	Awesome.
4249581	4250522	Oh, also, how could I forget?
4250602	4252945	Nobuo Uematsu has a new song, Every New Morning.
4253005	4253906	You know Nobuo Uematsu.
4254706	4260733	Anyhow, 100% of the proceeds from the Play for Japan, the album, will go straight to the Japanese Red Cross.
4261153	4263936	More information available, playforjapan.org.
4264217	4265238	But I think this is great, too.
4265398	4268722	It will be released in early June on the iTunes Store.
4269162	4273763	So, I mean, you know, argue if you will if you hate Apple or whatever, but it is a huge store.
4273883	4274984	It's going to be very easy.
4275084	4279885	And what I like about it is that I remember a time three years ago it was very hard to find video game music on iTunes.
4280285	4284526	Now it seems like it's really broken through, and it's pretty easy to find a lot of the newer soundtracks on there.
4284566	4287267	So props to iTunes, who hopefully will be featuring that.
4287587	4289508	So that will be available for sale.
4289788	4292048	Again, 100% of the proceeds go to the Japanese Red Cross.
4292408	4293269	Playforjapan.org.
4294689	4297330	Let's get into the classic game of the week.
4297510	4301632	Every week here on the show we like to highlight a game from gaming's past.
4302032	4318360	DarkSakura likes to jump into the vault and say, Hey, look, while you're talking about your newfangled Nintendos of the present, I remember Nintendos back in my day, back when we played awesome games such as this one.
4320335	4322036	Bionic Commando for the NES
4338690	4343513	and, uh, it's kind of based off of the 87 Bionic Commando.
4343553	4344173	This one came out in 88.
4344213	4358662	Um, you basically have to explore different stages and you play as Lad Spencer, who is going to rescue the guy from the first game, who was called Super Joe, who was captured by, uh,
4359643	4370010	The Empire, because you've got to go stop the Empire, the General of the Imperial Forces, who is completing the project himself.
4370671	4383741	So you have to go and rescue Super Joe and lead the FF Battalion, or Double Force Battalion, who are all commandos who use wired guns to rescue him.
4384241	4397528	So you've got a stage select map and you move around the map screen and you can choose to move to different areas but you have to go back and go through these overhead areas to get to different places.
4397968	4406033	There's 19 areas in the game, 1 through 12 are combat and 13 and 19 are all neutral areas where you can't fight at all.
4408835	4414059	If you fire your weapon at all in those areas, you'll be attacked by a peacekeeping force.
4415400	4418322	But these are places that you can get information and items.
4419643	4424567	There's also green enemy trucks on the map selection that will try to block your helicopter.
4425467	4429570	And if you fly into one of these while you're traveling, you have to battle the troops.
4429771	4431312	And this is the overhead part I was talking about.
4431332	4432132	It's kind of like Commando.
4432152	4433113	So...
4436596	4440959	You can actually kill certain enemies to get additional continues.
4442000	4457790	So you've got a bionic arm, so you can't jump, you just use the arm, and you latch on and can swing yourself at 45 degrees, or you can go up, or exactly right, so you've got different ways that you can move, but it's really just those three ways.
4457830	4463814	You can also use the arm to deflect some bullets and grab different enemies and items.
4464975	4466096	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4486634	4492016	So, at any rate, there were clearly changes that were made to the game.
4493296	4498477	As you can probably tell from the Japanese title, the whole thing was basically about fighting Nazis.
4499457	4506139	The Empire was like a neo-Nazi nation, and they used a swastika for their logo.
4506599	4516401	So of course when it came out over here, they changed the logo and everything, and they changed things to the Imperial Forces and blah blah.
4518201	4527363	Although the end boss still looks like Hitler, but they called him Master D. It's like, hi, we kind of know who that is.
4527723	4530043	Except you do get to see his head explode, which is pretty cool.
4530844	4532724	Because he was a fuckhead.
4533775	4540399	Yeah, and I gotta say, TigerClaw in the chatroom says, this game is from an era before the ESRB, so they were able to get away with some gore on an NES game.
4540659	4543901	That wasn't just because of the ESRB, that was Nintendo's own policy to get rid of the gore.
4544002	4546183	But yeah, heads exploding, you didn't see that in many games.
4546621	4549102	No, and it was a gory-ass explosion.
4549162	4551062	I mean, it was like, bleh, everywhere.
4552022	4555503	So yeah, there have been other remakes.
4555623	4571128	There was a portable version of Bayek Commando on the Game Boy in 1992 that was based off of the NES game, but it was turned into a futuristic one because this was actually set in the 80s when it was made in the 80s.
4573749	4583796	And then there was, of course, Bionic Commando Rearmed that was developed by Grin and it came out in 2008 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4584577	4586118	And the sequel that came out February 2011.
4587619	4594624	And then the original NES Bionic Commando was featured on a Game Boy Advance compilation.
4594704	4599128	It was called Capcom Classics Minimix, which also included Strider and Mighty Final Fight.
4599808	4600789	Two really good games.
4600849	4602731	Well, maybe not in the NES trailer, but still.
4603813	4609519	So, uh... There's also a book, a novelization, that was based off of the NES version.
4609799	4611881	So the main character's called Jack Markson.
4612342	4615866	He lost his arm when ninjas attacked his hotel room and kidnapped Super Joe.
4616567	4618769	So they replaced it with... Sounds like a Michael Bay movie.
4618789	4619450	I know.
4620230	4643748	they replaced it with a bionic limb with a grappling hook and other neato things so there's different things the book was super toned down and they didn't kill anybody although certain things like some of the deaths of Hal and Kilt are kept in and they just sort of skim over most of the stuff that goes on so they can fit in the book
4645120	4654383	and there's an illustrated Bionic Commando story actually on a website that I will be linking in the chat room and if you're not in the chat room, oh well, too bad.
4657744	4660946	So here you can find out about Super Joe and about Spencer.
4661966	4662226	The end.
4663169	4668453	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Bionic Commando for the NES.
4669614	4680163	Not to be confused with the arcade version, or as Ziba keeps asking about in the chatroom, the Commodore 64 version, which I don't even remember playing, but I'm pretty sure it was based off the arcade more than it was the NES.
4680203	4682505	Speaking of which, you did see the magazine that I linked to you, right?
4683926	4691993	Retro Gamer is doing a Commodore 64 special this month, as well as the Anniversary of Street Fighter.
4692270	4694512	We need more Commodore 64 games in our Classic Game of the Week.
4695312	4697454	Well, guess who didn't play much Commodore 64?
4697514	4698215	I know, I know.
4698415	4701257	Every week that you're not here, I end up doing something for Commodore 64.
4701297	4703419	Well, then why don't you pick the week after, huh?
4703839	4704499	We'll see, we'll see.
4704660	4705380	Okay, then.
4705440	4705700	All right.
4706601	4708042	Do you want to do this segment or me?
4708242	4710064	No, it's DarkSakura's Game of the Week.
4710264	4711165	Maybe I'll pick something.
4711405	4711685	All right.
4711865	4716369	I've covered stuff that have imported to the... Maybe I'll pick a Spectrum game.
4717049	4717750	Okay, that works.
4718250	4719211	Or a Vetrex.
4719271	4721973	Or just Spectre was a great PC game back in the day.
4722153	4723214	I'll pick a Vetrix game.
4723634	4723954	All right.
4724074	4724334	Maybe.
4725295	4728657	Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
4728697	4730078	We've got a busy part B tonight.
4730118	4734580	Your Twitter topics, as you send those in, hurry up and get them in at twitter.com slash OLR.
4734901	4736101	And we've got rapid-fire news.
4736321	4738303	News about Call of Duty's Elite system.
4738343	4740544	That's been catching a lot of press this week.
4740924	4745367	Also news about the 3DS shop we're going to get into and our E3 predictions.
4745827	4750590	We're going to get into those as well in just a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4757150	4757590	Orange Lounge Radio
4778895	4783959	And you can actually go in there and there's actually a compiled list of every episode we ever did.
4784499	4788002	And it's like, keep scrolling, keep scrolling, keep scrolling.
4788822	4789843	It's pretty impressive.
4790544	4792285	We're going to be going on 10 years next year.
4792305	4793666	I know, right?
4794226	4796168	Anyhow, we don't want to toot our own horn.
4796628	4799450	Unless it is talking about the... I can toot our horn if we want.
4799610	4802012	Unless it's talking about the E3 coverage we're going to bring you next week.
4802312	4805594	Tuesday and Wednesday night, 7pm Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern at Ustream.
4806054	4810537	A little something new for us, but it'll be cool because we can play around with video and visuals a little bit.
4810557	4813499	So that'll be available to... My God, you alright over there?
4813760	4815701	That'll be available on Ustream.
4816341	4826088	And if you're really good, because you can do Ustream broadcasting from your phone now, maybe I'll do a Ustream broadcast of us getting Bobby on California Screamin'.
4828049	4829170	I have to explain what just happened.
4829370	4829850	Oh, what happened?
4830210	4841117	I ran over the cord for my headphones and then when I moved my chair it ran over the cord of the microphone and yanked it out of my hand and then I had it all the way wrapped around my legs and then I rolled over my foot.
4842137	4842337	Ouch.
4842517	4843518	Sorry everybody for that.
4843538	4843938	You're a klutz.
4844218	4844819	No, I'm not.
4844879	4846540	Alright, just accident prone.
4846900	4851663	Alright, let's get to plugs for the spinoff shows then we'll get to rapid fire news.
4851703	4853504	So, quickly, the spinoff shows.
4853544	4855205	The other shows that we do when we're not doing OLR.
4855785	4856787	Comic Insanity.
4857609	4860736	We're at Infamous.net and a new episode will be up on Tuesday.
4861358	4863382	So go there and listen to us.
4863523	4865227	Do it with Mar and Marvel and Dan Jetto.
4866107	4866467	Comics!
4895672	4899636	Okay, let's move on with some rapid-fire news, and there's a lot this week.
4899736	4902980	And then, of course, your tweets, so you better get those in, because we're almost done.
4903580	4905322	Twitter.com slash OLR.
4905402	4909987	By the way, speaking of Twitter, I want to get a plug out for this, because Bobby is helping us with those E3 wrap-up shows.
4910648	4913791	He's going to be helping us get interviews.
4914211	4916814	He's going to be, I mean, they're like...
4917094	4919035	Mostly his shows, probably, if you think about it.
4919055	4920976	But no, we'll be here giving our smart-ass commentary.
4921917	4931262	But I do want to say about Bobby, speaking of Twitter, if you're not following Bobby on Twitter, you should be, because he's kind of doing, he's biting an idea we did a couple years ago, but with permission.
4931302	4931842	We told him we could.
4932422	4951959	uh that is you drive him on the show floor he is very minimal appointments so if you're like Bobby I heard this game might be on the show floor and uh nobody's covering it he'll go find out for you so all that stuff that used to be in Kensha Hall that's now kind of sprinkled throughout the East Halls and West Halls uh he'll go find that stuff for you
4952327	4955529	I need to know what Natsume's putting out right now.
4955749	4956769	There's the first assignment.
4956789	4958490	Who cares?
4958810	4962292	Seriously, Twin Cities or Twin Town.
4962452	4972057	We demand that Bobby goes to Natsume's booth, finds the largest chibi thing that they have on display in the booth and get a picture with it.
4973263	4973863	It's Harvest Moon.
4973903	4974184	Come on.
4974224	4975284	It's always Harvest Moon.
4975705	4978446	No, one year they had the tulip game they were showing.
4978466	4979727	The tulip game was great.
4980127	4980988	And it did come out.
4981208	4982369	You run up and kiss people.
4982389	4983069	It did come out.
4983089	4984290	It was a GameStop exclusive.
4985931	4989373	But I want a cow.
4990914	4992915	I want cow swag from the Harvest Moon people.
4993516	4995617	I have like a pig from them.
4995697	4997298	I have a sheep somewhere.
4997318	4998139	I have their pig.
4998939	4999479	But I want a cow.
4999499	5000380	And I'm holding a ransom.
5002279	5003600	I don't want a pig, it's not kosher.
5032026	5037471	Aftermath, Map Pack, and Skin Bundle with the Wraith skin, multiplayer skin for Resistance 2.
5038452	5038933	All for $40.
5039393	5045999	You know, I actually may pick this up because I sold back Resistance 1 a while ago and I never really finished Resistance 2 before I sold it back.
5046680	5050223	And I'm really looking forward to number 3, so might have to pick it up again.
5051204	5051564	Pretty cool.
5052986	5053086	Um...
5055055	5067448	Also, this is kind of interesting because usually you hear about these type of things when people are doing their own kind of portable console mods, but they're actually selling portable Dreamcasts.
5067768	5076117	Now, these are not necessarily, I think, official Dreamcast items actually sanctioned by Sega or something.
5076597	5079239	But it's actually a portable system.
5080359	5081840	It's going to go for 38,000 yen, or roughly $470 US.
5091021	5091742	That's kind of crazy.
5091862	5094844	It does look like something like Ben Heck would put out.
5095765	5100588	I mean, very vacuum-formed shell and whatnot.
5101109	5108315	But yeah, if you're really interested in a portable Dreamcast, seriously, you're better off building your own because it'd be way cheaper.
5109495	5110036	Way cheaper.
5111394	5120684	and then finally, if you wanted to pick up the U-Draw and you don't own a Wii, you can now do that because it'll be coming out on 360 and PlayStation 3.
5121305	5122786	HD U-Draw!
5123187	5123947	HD U-Draw.
5124047	5126230	It's getting some enhancements.
5126830	5129713	It's going to be a multi-touch tablet.
5130213	5134237	It's going to have a high-definition input, 2000x1600 resolution.
5135378	5138261	And you'll be able to do the pinch and stretch, rotate features.
5138281	5139562	Pictionary HD.
5139962	5141764	It's built-in tilt sensors.
5141824	5143405	Now you can draw penises in HD.
5144606	5161325	and of course they'll be coming with UDraw Studio where in this case it's going to be kind of a souped up UDraw Studio UDraw Studio Instant Artist with tutorials and new interfaces and stuff like that and of course there's going to be supporting different UDraw titles like Pictionary and that kind of thing um
5161946	5163307	I don't know, it looks kind of interesting.
5164007	5171731	Just from what I've seen with UDraw on the Wii, the support for it is kind of eh, because it's only THQ that's putting stuff out.
5171791	5178954	Now I know that we heard rumors that maybe Nintendo might put something out for it, and everyone's hoping for Mario Paint, but eh, I don't know.
5178974	5182055	That's a stretch, I think.
5182476	5184277	But at least THQ's supporting it.
5184337	5189319	They've got the Wii, I want to say there's about five games out for it now.
5190379	5191120	So, it's not bad.
5191480	5193481	Frisbee in our chatroom says, get a real tablet.
5194121	5196203	DarkTetsuya says, hey, look at it this way.
5196263	5197743	The Bob Ross game lives on.
5198324	5199444	You can paint happy little trees.
5199645	5200305	But let's be real.
5200525	5201646	They're all drawing penises with it.
5201906	5210290	By the way, one thing I forgot to mention about that Duke Nukem Forever demo, there's a whiteboard in it that seems to exist for no other reason than for 12-year-olds to draw penises on it.
5210911	5211111	Yep.
5212151	5215913	And then the onlookers will commentate, oh, that sounds like a good plan, Duke.
5215933	5216874	Yeah.
5217274	5217494	Eh, wiener.
5245583	5250087	I think it'd be cool though if they did, you know, put, they really need a new Magic Pendulum game.
5251108	5252670	Seriously, that'd be awesome.
5254191	5256994	Breakman in our chatroom says, 3D vaginas are ugly.
5257475	5258736	Yeah, I saw Cloverfield too.
5262532	5262912	Anything else?
5264073	5264393	That's it.
5264673	5265834	Oh, hey, then let's get to more news.
5266554	5269996	Michael J. Fox is going to be in the Back to the Future games.
5270276	5278040	Yeah, that's pretty cool because he wasn't in the first few, but they are going to bring him back for the fifth and, I guess, the last game in the Back to the Future.
5278060	5279921	Of course, these are the Telltale Games episodic.
5280381	5281141	Now, here's the thing.
5281582	5284163	They are not going to just simply replace A.J.
5284243	5287325	Loscaio, who's been doing the voice and apparently been doing a very good job.
5287685	5289866	Michael J. Fox is going to be in the conclusion of...
5290306	5291728	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5314828	5315849	Three is poop.
5316089	5316749	Three didn't happen.
5317369	5319130	This movie is really good.
5319230	5320350	Are there any good one-liners?
5320390	5323432	Like, do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?
5324032	5326453	No, but my favorite line in the whole movie is, fuck off.
5327473	5328974	And you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.
5329054	5329634	Alright, you got it.
5329955	5330535	But here's the thing.
5331495	5335217	As far as the X-Men goes, the reason why I bring it up... Oh, now I forget why I bring it up.
5335237	5336017	Why did I bring it up?
5336337	5342580	Oh yeah, we were talking about... Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were originally supposed to have a cameo in it.
5343340	5354270	as, I guess, playing the older versions, kind of like they did in the original X-Men movie, but they didn't film it and nixed it because they didn't want the new X-Men movie tied to the original at all.
5355532	5356353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5379410	5386154	But it's just like, my god, if somebody tried to play a young Captain Jean-Luc Picard, like, I don't think I'd ever be able to believe it.
5386174	5386995	They tried to do that.
5387695	5388016	Seriously.
5388036	5388796	Oh, that's right, they did.
5389076	5390517	Oh, that's right, they did, yeah.
5390657	5397962	Seriously, how fucking annoying is it that he picked Arnold Schwarzenegger to be Mr. Freeze over Patrick Stewart?
5398002	5399263	It would have been perfect!
5400063	5400784	Perfect!
5400804	5401344	Don't get me started.
5401384	5401944	But no.
5401964	5403946	You know what, it's a good thing Patrick Stewart stayed away from it.
5403966	5405286	Yeah, you know what, it would have killed him.
5405527	5407568	I mean, seriously, it would have been Earl Julia all over again.
5409831	5410432	Hey, L.A.
5410492	5412293	Noire, which is a game that Loki's loaning me.
5412333	5412953	I'm very excited.
5412973	5414774	I can take it out of my queue.
5414974	5415074	L.A.
5415114	5417576	Noire has got some download content that's going to be coming out.
5417876	5422318	DLC is going to come, what, May 17th all the way through July 12th.
5422338	5424480	And there's DLC cases that you can download.
5424540	5425980	One of them's called Reefer Madness.
5426040	5427401	I don't think it plays into the movie.
5427681	5429222	But hey, The Naked City.
5429762	5431383	Let's hope we see some more nude people.
5431844	5433364	Yeah, that's coming out on May 31st for $4.00.
5434545	5438448	Anyway, if you want to buy all this stuff a la carte, you can pay $20 for it.
5438889	5444393	But you can also pre-buy all of it for $10 with what's called the Rockstar Pass.
5444834	5447336	But you have until June 14th to take advantage of that.
5447396	5449057	Otherwise, it's going up to $12 after that.
5450138	5450919	So there you go.
5451639	5452380	Lots of stuff coming out.
5452880	5457404	There's even, I guess, challenges, new suits and guns and whatever, horse armor.
5458164	5461647	But also the social club things, May 17th.
5463088	5463649	Interesting stuff.
5465723	5494018	so LA Noire DLC speaking of download stuff and all this stuff Capcom has reversed a decision we reported on no actually we didn't report on this last week because I think we weren't here so Capcom did take that DRM I seem to remember talking about it this annoying DRM was going to be in Super Street Fighter 4 on the PC that if you are not connected to the internet it won't bork the game but you'll be limited to 15 fighters and of course people raised hell on the forums and Capcom said
5494998	5518728	okay okay we're back and down yeah you you will be able to play as everybody even if not connected to the internet however as one would logically expect you won't have online multiplayer replay sharing or watching and achievements unless you're online and logged in which yeah that does make sense I think so there you go the consumers win I think moving on
5520185	5521185	We do have other news.
5521265	5528388	There is a Final Fantasy V rated by the ESRB for a PSN release in North America, which is pretty good.
5528748	5535311	So we'll be getting lots of classic games, and hopefully it's going to have the same treatment that 3 and those had.
5537672	5541233	Then we have Duke Nukem Forever download content details.
5541353	5551135	We have the first download pack that has four weapons, a minigun, a noob tube, a sticky grenade, and a BFG, which we all know what BFG stands for.
5552335	5556476	DLC number two is a deathmatch map.
5556496	5559297	So there's EDF base, LKR, and map three.
5559317	5560197	It's just called map three.
5560897	5568279	And then the third pack is 15 new single player maps, arm wrestling, and the impregnator weapon, and a karaoke machine.
5570040	5570360	So hey.
5571260	5574001	Also, if you've pre-ordered the game, you get the first DLC for free.
5574681	5580603	And then the last news is in Batman Arkham City, you can play as Catwoman, and she gets her own storyline.
5581083	5582584	She better not be played by Halle Berry.
5582704	5583384	She looks pretty hot.
5583604	5585345	Don't get me wrong, Halle Berry's hot, but that movie?
5585505	5585905	Not hot.
5586165	5586305	No.
5586585	5587425	But she looks pretty hot.
5588826	5589126	That's it.
5590623	5591825	All right.
5592345	5592966	Let's get into what?
5592986	5593847	Some Twitter topics now?
5594588	5595109	That's right.
5595149	5596591	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5596671	5598433	And every week you guys can send us your tweets.
5599455	5601037	Show us your tweets, as we like to say.
5601818	5602519	And we read them.
5602939	5603881	As long as they don't suck.
5606563	5614407	Let's start off Twitter this week with... Oh, Fidelt61 tweeted us this, and I don't think we actually covered this elsewhere on the show.
5615307	5620730	TrekMovie.com reports that a video game set in the Star Trek movie universe is coming in 2012.
5620770	5622851	DarkSakura, did you hear about this?
5622891	5624792	This seems right up your alley here at Star Trek Online.
5625472	5628233	It's going to be set in the Abrams Trek universe.
5628854	5632575	I'm assuming to maybe bridge the new movie, because the new movie's out next year too, right?
5633476	5633716	It is.
5634284	5634605	Kirk and Spock
5644918	5644978	ZQ
5675338	5675939	Bridge Things.
5676319	5679862	This is also the first full Star Trek video game since 2007.
5681223	5692871	They are not counting Star Trek Online, but they would say that Star Trek Conquest, the eh game that came out from Bethesda, because that's what most people said about it, it will be coming out in 2012.
5696048	5696688	I'll check it out.
5696748	5697209	Heck yeah.
5697929	5698910	I like Star Wars enough.
5699190	5700111	Or Star Trek.
5701212	5704014	I have an alt tab open with a Star Wars story that's coming later.
5704054	5704355	My bad.
5706036	5714423	Essex22 tweeted us and said, Just curious what you guys might consider the best downloadable co-op PS3 title.
5714864	5717506	Want to find something a friend and I can play online.
5717986	5718727	Any suggestions?
5718907	5721369	Best co-op downloadable title.
5722370	5724731	Portal 2 PC Download it on Steam
5749176	5749696	Downloadable?
5749716	5749756	Um...
5770600	5772721	It's hard because I'm not sure what type of games you really like.
5774161	5776102	And PS3 is also kind of limited.
5777562	5779683	I mean, not as much stuff jumps to mind.
5779703	5781163	They don't have Quake 3 Arena.
5781623	5783484	They don't have kind of the same selection.
5783504	5785985	They don't have Perfect Dark and some of the same stuff that the Xbox does.
5787305	5789506	The PixelJunk games are insanely popular.
5789706	5791006	I would check those out too.
5791907	5793107	So, things to think about.
5794754	5815968	more tweets coming to us from TheBaconBits tweeted us with something the Nintendo controller spotted at E3 but then when I bring this up in a new window I'm like this is somebody trying to be lousy I think because what this is a picture of is I think it's just an N64 controller all taped up
5817495	5820076	Yeah, somebody just posted an N64 controller, I think.
5820217	5821817	A little lulzy there.
5822238	5826540	Although that would be kind of funny if they just used the 64 controller all over again, but I kind of doubt it.
5828161	5832023	Spazernator tweets us, Usual drill, free TV shows on the PSN store.
5832443	5834244	Also, there's free movie rentals too.
5834605	5835965	I gotta email him offline.
5836386	5840388	Something about he set us up an account that has movies for me to watch.
5841409	5843191	I haven't even downloaded the update.
5862051	5863191	I will, though, probably this week.
5864012	5864552	I don't forget.
5865252	5866112	What did you download?
5867232	5871513	I downloaded Super Stardust HD, and I have Infamous in my queue.
5871993	5873594	We haven't downloaded anything yet, I think.
5873614	5875174	Now, do you get PSP games as well?
5875394	5877655	Yes, you get two PS3 and two PSP.
5877675	5880415	I don't even have... Nice, huh?
5880635	5881676	I'm gonna download something anyways.
5882036	5882636	Yes, you should.
5882736	5883596	Take up the opportunity.
5885016	5887417	Going to some tweets from Blue Swim.
5888123	5897965	heard OLR play the opening song to Katamari Damacy on the break and thought of Retro Force Go Orange Lounge Foodio question, what will you be snacking on during the E3 pressers?
5898325	5912749	I'm gonna nom a bag of spicy sweet chili Doritos Popcorn Yep, me too, kettle corn Vegetables, because we have a bunch of them Kettle corn specifically I will be doing the Michael Jackson thriller Yes, I'm gonna be doing the Michael Jackson thriller gif
5914699	5919239	Especially during Sony's presser Lots of carrots And I will be tweeting as well
5919713	5920994	I can't wait to read your tweets.
5922555	5924717	We need to look into that Cover It Live software.
5924737	5926459	I don't even know if you could use that at your work day.
5926619	5932764	Whatever, I don't even... I know, you don't think it's a big deal, but people love their Loki rage.
5934125	5938348	It's just gonna be... See, the problem is I have to watch them at work.
5939089	5945314	I have no problem doing that because my boss is gone and his boss is gone, so... Well, it's not like it's not related to your job.
5945334	5947976	These are the games you're gonna be selling at Christmas time.
5948056	5948397	I think...
5948897	5950618	You do have a right to watch this at work.
5950658	5953120	But the problem is they let go so many people.
5953220	5955301	It's like, stupid Nazis.
5956942	5957322	Don't let me.
5957543	5958743	No, I'll just lock the door.
5958763	5960084	What are they going to do?
5960244	5960805	Lock the door?
5961125	5962606	I'll lock the door to the conference room.
5962626	5964307	We're going to be watching it on nice HD TV.
5964727	5965087	There you go.
5965567	5972371	Actdeft tweets us, What game or gaming-related news would truly surprise you if it happened on E3 this week?
5972431	5978194	Now, we are going to get into E3 predictions a little later, but I'm going to allow this question because it's not talking about what do you think will happen.
5978214	5981815	This is talking about what would surprise you if it happened.
5982696	5984957	Is there anything that would truly surprise you if it happened?
5987373	6007491	Sony doesn't fuck up that'd surprise me the F-Zero game on the Nintendo console I don't think it's gonna happen so I would say it would genuinely surprise me I would be tickled pink when I go down there on Thursday to pick up Bobby I might just have to rush the doors if the F-Zero game happens
6009344	6013111	Um... There's not really much that could be surprising to me.
6013492	6016938	Like I said, I'm going to this with really low expectations.
6017739	6017820	Um...
6019665	6026892	It's so hard to call things like that too because when I think of surprises, I think of things that literally come the fuck out of nowhere.
6027133	6036542	I would say Gabe Newell getting up on stage at the Sony press conference and saying, Hey, by the way, I don't hate Sony anymore and we're going to integrate Steam and the PlayStation.
6036902	6038244	That was a fucking surprise.
6038804	6041026	I couldn't have called that.
6041107	6042128	I don't think anyone could have.
6042888	6059843	Um, and Final Fantasy XIV, as lulzy as that came up, as that was two years ago, let us not forget when Jack Trenton was on stage and said, we're gonna be delivering Final Fantasy XIV, everybody was like, oh, he just fucked up, he meant XIII too, and no, it was fucking XIV was coming out already, even though XIII wasn't out.
6059863	6062785	No, really it was XI, but you know, XI HD.
6062845	6065067	Surprises are so hard to foresee.
6065788	6065828	Um...
6067401	6094271	I would say like a very strange partnership especially from Microsoft and I know that's so vague I know the return of Xbox Live experiences like 1 vs 100 I sadly think that shit is gone which pisses me off I think it was a great thing that they had but if they were to say hey we're bringing back the multiplayer game show type events the live events on Xbox that would truly surprise me
6096209	6098390	Where the fuck are my Burger King Kinect games?
6100970	6105891	Burger King Kinect Part 2, that would be your... No, Burger King Kinect Part 1.
6105971	6106731	Where the hell are they?
6107111	6113073	They promised me that they're going to have some exclusive Burger King Kinect games.
6113493	6115373	And I have yet to see these.
6116234	6118114	I was all ready to buy them because they were going to be terrible.
6118414	6135494	I know, the Nintendo console projects imagery, any type of projector built into the Nintendo, that would fucking surprise me because that is not happening the holodeck holodeck announced and it's coming to you from on live because nobody believed that shit would work either and look, there it is
6137937	6139338	On Life presents the holodeck.
6139738	6139998	All right.
6140599	6142220	I don't want to miss these tweets from Tiger Claw.
6142240	6142881	Let me get to these.
6143882	6147825	Top Gun and Days of Thunder to get Blu-ray game slash movie combos.
6147865	6148465	Did you hear about that?
6148786	6149586	They're selling the combo packs.
6149646	6150147	Yeah, I know about that.
6150187	6150927	I've been selling those.
6151108	6151628	Have you really?
6152129	6153229	I've known about that for a while.
6153850	6154811	And they sound lame.
6155371	6157473	It's, well, no, seriously, it's lame.
6157493	6158294	Here's what they're doing.
6158314	6168023	They're doing basically what they did with The Watchmen, where they take the really shitty, shitty PlayStation Network games that sold, like, garbage, and then they throw it in with the movie.
6168404	6169204	So that's what you're going to get.
6169224	6175210	You're going to get the really shitty garbage Top Gun game and the really terrible, you know, Days of Thunder game.
6175851	6176391	Awesome!
6176952	6178093	Hey, at least you get a movie.
6179397	6206965	I gotta read this comment in chat Kai Judo in our chatroom says Big Brother on Xbox Live Arcade would be awesome If they don't make it, I will I've gotta say this I was walking through Target And I saw their Wii section of games And, excuse me, strawberry part I saw for sale on the Wii The Survivor game that's now available on the Wii And look, I'm a fan of reality trash TV And I do watch almost every episode of Survivor stuff And I picked up this box And I just started laughing at how horrible this game looked
6207265	6210268	Now, have you seen the Amazing Race for the Wii?
6210288	6211569	I've heard that's garbage, too.
6211969	6212630	Oh, I'm sure it is.
6212650	6222237	But, I mean, like, actually, a Survivor game or something like that on Xbox Live Arcade and the party thing or whatever might not suck if they do it right.
6222518	6224780	It could actually be really fucking interesting.
6225160	6227262	But I just don't trust anyone to get it right.
6228762	6242307	because I look at this stuff that's on the Wii and I'm like oh the Wii game shows that work best are the minimalist ones like Wheel of Fortune that's pretty hard to fuck up Jeopardy again pretty hard to fuck up
6243007	6243688	Pressure Luck.
6244388	6245609	No whammies, no whammies, stop.
6245649	6248912	I mean, somehow, Game Show Network fucked it up when they revived it, but you know what I mean.
6248952	6250754	Classic Pressure Luck is still gold.
6251514	6251774	Anyhow.
6252915	6257599	Also from Tiger Claw, Penny Arcade comic to be adapted into a movie.
6258280	6259321	I had not heard about this.
6259601	6260442	Have you heard anything about this?
6260982	6262043	Yeah, it's a spin-off.
6262183	6265146	It's just basically... Well, since the games didn't work out so well.
6265346	6266447	No, it's not even a spin-off.
6266687	6270470	It's like a little three-panel comic that they did.
6271431	6272732	The story of the DivX player.
6272972	6275673	No, it's not even, it's none of the Penny Arcade characters.
6275733	6278795	It's basically this kid who is... The new kid.
6278855	6279496	The new kid, yeah.
6279536	6282537	He's moving, you know, normally it's moving to a new town.
6282557	6283758	Well, it's moving to a new planet.
6283838	6287800	And the planet has three quarters of the gravity that, you know, they had on Earth or whatever.
6288301	6291802	And so I'm guessing he's kind of like, you know, super strong and fast or whatever.
6291843	6295585	Because, you know, you would be if you went to a planet with less gravity.
6295665	6297186	Well, the guys behind... Everyone else would, too.
6297206	6297446	No.
6297486	6297526	No.
6298166	6298887	Thanks for watching!
6313628	6324113	I would question how much are the Penny Arcade people going to actually be involved in this because they are pretty good writers and they write some really funny, hilarious, insightful comments and their commentary on gaming culture has always been really good.
6324433	6332957	But then I read in this story here, Paramount has tapped Gary Witta, former PC Gamer Editor-in-Chief and Book of Eli screenwriter to pen the new kid and I roll my eyes.
6333157	6335058	This has nothing to do with the Penny Arcade comic.
6335138	6337759	It just happens to be this is a comic that they also made.
6338559	6339540	None of the characters are in it.
6339560	6340520	None of the funny stuff's in it.
6340580	6367891	I get that but I'm saying the Penny Arcade comic proves that they're good writers and I would like to see what they it's just like okay the South Park you know Trey and Matt are fucking hilarious I want to see the Book of Mormon play on that alone like it has nothing to do and I realize that that universe and South Park have nothing in common except recurring Mormon jokes over and over but I want to see that play based on the fact that I appreciate their work on the show and I think they're very good satirists that's what I'm getting at does that make sense
6368411	6368631	I hope.
6368892	6369112	Alright.
6369472	6370613	Anyhow, that does it for tweets tonight.
6370653	6371874	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6372195	6383165	Send us more tweets for next week or send your tweets over to Bobby because he's going to be roaming the halls of E3 and he is your little eyeball that you can command to go look at things.
6383425	6389831	And by the way, he did accept the challenge of going to find the giant stuffed animal at the Natsume booth and he will get Chibi Wolf.
6390632	6390992	And a cow.
6393140	6398202	By the way, you're not getting in the car to Disneyland without swag for DarkSakura and Sky.
6398882	6399902	Probably Dan, too.
6400902	6401583	No, just for me.
6402203	6404043	All right.
6405004	6405944	I'm giving him such a hard time.
6406224	6407024	All right, let's move on.
6407465	6408025	More news.
6408185	6408865	Plenty more news.
6408985	6411766	And the mailbag and our E3 predictions just around the corner.
6412463	6441168	yes so Activision not to lose out on a money making opportunity they have decided to create Call of Duty Elite it is a paid digital platform being created by Beachhead Studios built around right now Modern Warfare 3 and now the service does have free aspects to it and this would include also like you know you know guild making and you know uh
6442838	6444239	sharing videos and that kind of stuff.
6444299	6446840	It also tracks your stats.
6447140	6449201	Think of it like the Halo waypoint almost a little bit.
6451142	6462648	They have, of course, I guess they're saying part of the fee will go towards customer service operation that needs, I guess, they're supporting the back end for.
6462668	6466530	So they're saying it's going to have a small monthly fee, maybe like $8 or something.
6467331	6470152	And I don't know.
6470392	6471273	It just sounds...
6473007	6502271	interesting I guess especially since a lot of the players for Call of Duty are really just online heavy and it's really community driven so it makes sense that they would be doing something like this also it's a way for them to sell more subscriptions and make money we make every month off of World of Warcraft from Blizzard how could we make money every month off our other big games yeah why bother having them share videos on YouTube for free when they can do it on our service
6503755	6506877	and we could just take down all the videos on YouTube.
6507638	6508719	Well, I don't think they would do that.
6509039	6518186	And I think a lot of it's still free, but they have a video out there that you can check out that has some of the features of it and stuff.
6518926	6532276	It sounds a little bit also, I don't know if anyone remembers, because it's been around for at least a few months now since Medal of Honor, but remember there's also the EA Gun Club or whatever?
6532296	6532376	Yeah.
6533257	6538762	So they've got, you know, that kind of thing as well going on on the EA side.
6538782	6547190	So, you know, I guess, I don't know, it makes sense that they're kind of doing this sort of stuff and I'm sure they're going to have like, you know, betas for, you know, paid members and stuff like that.
6547230	6551174	Just a way to get people, kind of think of it like the PlayStation Plus program or something like that.
6553675	6553995	I don't know.
6554315	6556336	If you're hardcore, then it's worth it to you.
6556816	6560657	And then for those of us that don't get it, quote unquote, we just go, LOL, more money.
6560757	6572341	Well, even if you don't, like, for example, if you're not that hardcore into it, though, you can at least get some stuff out of the free portion of it.
6572861	6577843	Like, they have your career stats or all that stuff if you like the stat tracking.
6578523	6583025	I think they even have the hot points on the map and stuff where most of the players are
6583385	6610216	you know converging on and stuff like that so I don't know check out the free portion if it's not for you then you don't have to do it it's as simple as that you know we were talking a lot on Horde House today about $25 mounts and wow and why people buy them and you know some of us look at it and go why in the hell would you spend that money on a mount but for some people it's like pretty Barbie you know so you can't it's your money spend it on whatever you want
6612426	6615368	Hey, some details on the 3DS shop launch.
6616048	6621551	Excitebike 3D is going to be the free game that is on the 3DS shop when it launches June 6th.
6621851	6622971	Tomorrow, right?
6623492	6624092	Holy crap.
6624512	6625293	That's coming out of nowhere.
6627033	6627214	What?
6627294	6628014	You're shaking your finger.
6628703	6632085	No, my finger, that means whoop-dee-shit.
6632345	6634186	Oh, you're twirling your finger, my bad.
6634626	6641050	All right, the eShop launches this week, and it's going to be giving you Excitebike 3D free for 30 days.
6641190	6643371	I'm sure that will be fantastic in 3D.
6643752	6646233	I'm sure it will fully utilize the power of the 3DS.
6646273	6649755	It's the goddamn NES game with just the layers.
6649815	6651756	That's what all those NES games are going to do.
6653017	6656859	The background is one layer, and the sprites are a front layer, and it's, ooh, an effect.
6656939	6657319	That's it.
6658360	6662043	But, you know, a lot of people will pick it up and play it and go, ooh.
6662103	6663464	I will download it because it's free.
6663484	6663984	Yeah, it's free.
6664185	6671630	But if you think I'm buying any of your other fucking games, other NES games, and, you know, spending... Unfortunately, it doesn't have internet play.
6671891	6672951	Plus, how are they going to work that out?
6673492	6677835	Wasn't the original Excitebike kind of borked because there was a load-save mode?
6677855	6678716	Well, they could fix that.
6678916	6680897	Yeah, the original Excitebike was a disc game.
6681378	6685001	And then when they put it on the cartridge, like, it just flat out didn't work when they released it.
6685021	6688003	Yeah, but didn't they fix that, I thought, when it even came to the virtual console, though?
6688824	6689224	Maybe.
6689485	6690085	I can't remember.
6691285	6691926	Maybe somebody in chat.
6691946	6692966	This is why we have a live chat room.
6692986	6694047	Somebody will jump in here in a moment.
6694367	6695728	But anyway, let me give you some more details.
6696188	6698869	Excitebike 3D Classic will be free.
6699430	6701531	After 30 days, you know how much that will set you back?
6701631	6702251	Six bucks.
6702591	6703792	That's retarded.
6703832	6704873	That's a bunch of tacos.
6704913	6708575	Well, it's the $5 NES game plus a dollar premium.
6709850	6710391	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6728230	6734353	Also, Game Boy Ports, Super Mario Land, Alleyway, and Radar Mission will all be out on day one.
6735254	6740756	DSi and DSi XL owners will be able to transfer most of the DSiWare purchases to the system.
6741056	6743297	There are some things that are not going to be transferable.
6743617	6750440	I believe all of it has to do with licensed things like the Domo-kun games don't transfer over because they probably weren't licensed for more than the one console.
6750461	6751361	Yeah, they just came out over here.
6751981	6752882	I didn't know they did either.
6752902	6754162	It might only be a Japanese thing.
6754282	6754722	IDK.
6755443	6756283	Well, DSiWare.
6756743	6758884	Obviously, I'd never really downloaded any DSiWare stuff.
6758944	6759544	Hold on, though.
6759584	6760304	This is huge.
6761105	6765867	Pokédex 3D, a virtual compendium of Pokémon from black and white.
6766267	6767687	It is a free download.
6768227	6774470	It will allow you to just look up all the information in the world on the Pokémon 3D models.
6774890	6792274	StreetPass functionality You unlock random Pokemon by exchanging data I don't know if that ties into BlackWire I don't think it does It's something to do with the Pokedex And QR code support You take a picture of your friend Set it as a background layer Snap a picture of a QR code to introduce a Pokemon
6793769	6794330	Like what?
6795631	6796052	Whatever.
6796973	6801399	I think it's also got the AR cards or whatever support so you can do the 3D models or whatever.
6801899	6811612	I gotta admit, it sounds... I just can't wait for all the fucking mudkips because you know it's just a matter of time before we get Oprah introducing mudkips.
6812382	6813183	Dr. Wily's Revenge
6829662	6834606	Kirby's Dream Land, Baseball, and Phantasm, which was called Avenging Spirit over here.
6835166	6841592	Downtown Special, Kunikun no Jikaigeki Daio Zenin Shugo.
6841792	6844074	It's a River City Ransom spinoff with Samurais.
6845535	6848037	Also in Japan... You just said the magic word, Kunio.
6848835	6863746	Also in Japan on June 7th, Excitebike 3D, Mystery PI, 3D Block Breaking, and Xevious will be released as well, which I played at last year's E3, and it was the background on one layer and the sprites on the front layer.
6864907	6891204	Europe gets Excitebike, Alleyway, Mario Land, and Tennis every Thursday will Europe see more games on the 3DS so there you go all those announcements out now so they don't have to talk about it at the press conference because they will be spending all of their time undoubtedly talking about not just the new console but I'm sure they will first parade out Skyward Sword for an update they'll parade out 3DS titles including the Mario title and maybe some surprises there on the 3DS and then
6892285	6896607	easily half to two thirds will be about whatever this cafe thing is.
6898928	6901869	Salacious Pop in our chat room says, look under your seat.
6901989	6902849	It's a mudkip.
6903229	6905230	You get a mudkip and you get a mudkip.
6905650	6906810	Everyone's getting a mudkip.
6907971	6908651	Yay.
6908911	6909952	Is there a bee Pokemon?
6910012	6910632	All right, forget it.
6912096	6915498	Well, how about some other news for Nintendo?
6916299	6923284	The DS Lite actually today has a price reduction.
6923784	6925586	It's gone down to $99.
6926366	6927987	Sucks for all of you that bought one yesterday.
6929028	6929308	Yep.
6930789	6933471	But I guess they're just trying to clear out inventory.
6933511	6933871	Who knows?
6936533	6939215	But the games are still the games.
6939996	6941777	They're not getting a price reduction.
6942045	6943866	Pro tip, I saw them Foursquare.
6944346	6946687	I know you stopped using Foursquare, but there is a pretty good deal on it still.
6947187	6951889	Check into Toys R Us and you get, buy one, get one half off on DS and 3DS titles.
6952310	6952510	Huh.
6952870	6953230	Pro tip.
6953770	6954110	Pro tip.
6955411	6955591	Okay.
6956710	6958770	Um, which I don't think I got into it on this show.
6958810	6961291	I was talking about it more on the Bobby call at the end of his show.
6962291	6971613	But, uh, I'm convinced whatever this Nintendo controller is, their little touchscreen thing, um, I was saying on Bobby's show, you know, Nintendo's been making touchscreen controllers for about five, six years now.
6971833	6972553	It's called the DS.
6973133	6976113	And, uh, the bottom half of that, that's gonna be your controller.
6976513	6977614	It's a touchscreen with buttons.
6978094	6979214	You've had one all along.
6981134	6984855	It would be amazing if the DS would just work as a controller, but let's not.
6985275	6985595	Let's not.
6986713	6995949	There'll be a special new button or there'll be something extra on this thing Oh, Rob Alright Moving on Loki
6996782	7002288	Freestyle Games, you may remember them from such series as DJ Hero.
7002908	7007753	Well, thankfully they are not dead, which is good.
7008674	7021546	Apparently though, I guess they have confirmed 35 positions will be lost, but they still have a strong partnership with Activision, and they are currently working on a new innovative unannounced project.
7022986	7051535	and it says of course they plan to share details about those projects or said project in the next coming months it's good to see that they're still around hopefully we'll get at least a DJ Hero 3 out of them yeah that would be cool I would appreciate that Rama's correcting me on something in the chat room nope you get your money back if there's a price drop within two weeks of purchase you get the difference back well now that really depends on what store you buy it at but okay fine I'll play your game here and say sucks for those that bought it 15 days ago
7054856	7056797	But why are you buying a DS now?
7056877	7059218	I mean, seriously, buy something else.
7059919	7062800	The 3DS will slowly add value before Christmas.
7062860	7068984	Before Christmas, you're going to see... And there will be... Like, you're going to probably see the Netflix on 3DS in action and some of this at the...
7071605	7075247	I think the 3DS is going to see a lot more added value before Christmas time.
7075267	7076488	It's just us early adopters.
7076968	7083991	We got Street Fighter, Pilotwings, Ridge Racer, IDK, Steel Diver, and that's Zelda.
7084072	7085432	Oh yeah, Zelda.
7085772	7087413	A game we played 10 years ago.
7088774	7089674	It was overrated then.
7090075	7094097	For the love of God, publishers, stop making your old games.
7095217	7098059	Making an old game HD is not a fucking new game.
7099865	7102067	Who remembers a company called Origin?
7102707	7103688	Do you remember this company?
7103768	7107551	Origin, I believe, didn't they have the Ultima games back in the day?
7107891	7111794	The only Origin I know of is the cosmetic company.
7112555	7114777	Well, Origin, yeah, they did the Ultima games, which was huge.
7115197	7118800	Get this, EA bought Origin Systems some time ago.
7118820	7120021	It was like 20 years ago they bought it.
7120041	7120721	It was a long time ago.
7120761	7128207	They're bringing back the brand, so to speak, or at least the name, with a direct-to-consumer gaming platform.
7128547	7128587	E.A.
7128607	7128767	Store
7148118	7153002	Star Wars The Old Republic is supposedly going to be downloadable only on Origin.
7153963	7159849	Origin will have its own application, which you can find, connect with friends, blah, blah, blah, download, play PC games.
7159889	7169118	Basically, they're doing everything that Steam's doing, trying to get a little more competition in space because let's face it, the games for Windows Live thing really hasn't, you know, just...
7169358	7171880	Broke through like I think Microsoft was hoping it would.
7172720	7175602	Apparently the service is also going to work on mobile devices.
7176142	7180305	Scrabble, mobile versions of Battlefield 3, all of that will be on the...
7182416	7183957	Origin Store as well.
7184317	7188858	Speaking of Ultima, randomly, I did read an article that Ultima 4 is now free to play online.
7189538	7194200	So if you want to go back and play a classic RPG, it's ass hard too.
7194280	7196521	It's just really a difficult title.
7197081	7200082	The NES version really dumbed it up and it still was really hard.
7200602	7201422	I would check out Ultima 4.
7202523	7204123	That's what RPGs were when I was a kid.
7205404	7205924	And we liked it.
7208277	7214006	More information, I'm sure, at EA's press conference, which is at 1230 Pacific, 330 Eastern on Monday.
7215872	7219013	on right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
7219153	7229295	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will dive in, pick a few of her favorites and read them right now on the air.
7229395	7234876	Well, we got a bunch, so I'm only going to read four and I picked them at random and I didn't pick any that were by the same person.
7235296	7235516	Okay.
7235956	7237396	So that was my criteria.
7237476	7239557	So if you're not getting read, don't worry, I probably...
7240857	7242979	And you shouldn't get butt hurt if you're not getting read.
7243119	7247464	I mean, I don't want to sound like we have ego here, but we do have a nice listenership.
7247504	7252889	We appreciate everybody that listens, but when you all email us at once, we can't read it all or it would be a seven hour show.
7252929	7258755	It's nothing personal, but I would like to say that if you've got something to send us, just do it in one email.
7258835	7260016	I don't care if it's really long.
7261538	7262539	I would prefer the one email.
7263706	7265387	So this one comes from Holly.
7266107	7268428	Exactly how stupid is this guy who complained about it?
7268468	7270809	And it's actually about the Portal 2 being offending.
7271489	7273030	Seriously, GLaDOS is the villain.
7273130	7274391	Wheatley is the villain.
7274891	7276992	They're supposed to make you feel bad and insult you.
7277932	7282014	My husband is 200 pounds overweight and he found the fat jokes absolutely hilarious.
7282154	7282354	Why?
7282414	7283475	Because they are villains.
7309284	7318812	I think too, God, this was an ugly story last week, but yeah, I mean, GLaDOS was very, you couldn't take GLaDOS seriously.
7319844	7320425	You know what I mean?
7320565	7322526	Like, the way the character was built.
7322686	7327290	And Wheatley was designed to be the dumbest moron that ever lived, end quote.
7327490	7330913	To me, that whole thing was just sensationalist media.
7331313	7332254	And it's just unfortunate.
7332274	7334736	Like, yeah, people are going to get offended, but you know what?
7334756	7335917	We all get offended at weird things.
7336157	7341001	They were completely the news, quote, professionals.
7341341	7342542	Did they ever respond to you, by the way?
7342602	7342823	No.
7343043	7343463	Of course not.
7343863	7344644	Highly unprofessional.
7346085	7347206	Don't believe anything that they say.
7348247	7349088	More emails.
7350476	7351977	This one comes through the website.
7352397	7354638	Just wanted to get your opinions on some things.
7354718	7357940	What did you think of the original Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark?
7358600	7362022	I myself enjoy these games quite a bit because I'm a big fan of first-person shooters.
7362382	7364363	Keep up the good work, sincerely, CD Thunder.
7365903	7368244	Well, they both made me throw up.
7369585	7370626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7390496	7392438	Goldeneye was simply a landmark title.
7392578	7394700	It did so much for first-person shooters.
7395260	7401446	That's why they tried to imitate it on the Wii and try to hit gold twice, but it just wasn't the same.
7402567	7405029	And that's the unfortunate thing with a lot of these retro updates.
7405089	7405890	It's just not the same.
7406470	7408412	Well, the first Goldeneye came out, what, 15 years ago?
7408452	7409132	No, not that long.
7409152	7410133	Well, whenever the movie was out.
7410353	7412055	It was the late 90s.
7412956	7414817	So I guess it's the difference between...
7417296	7418217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7438476	7438856	Just saying.
7439476	7440857	Well, we got another one through the website.
7442457	7443737	This is from Calru.
7443757	7448418	I understand that the news is trying to blame the game... Okay, this is probably more about the portal thing.
7449939	7457661	I understand that the news is trying to blame the game for poor dialogue and DarkSakura was blaming the news channel for their poor investigation, but neither of you guys really looked at the real issue.
7458061	7459001	And that is the rating...
7460962	7462942	This person is using such horrible grammar.
7462962	7464023	There's no punctuation in here.
7464183	7465743	There's none but one ellipse.
7466163	7466563	Okay, anyway.
7467324	7478287	So the game was rated E10+, and should have been rated T. So a lot of the concepts in the game seem to be a little over the head of a 10-year-old, so let's stop blaming games and blame the rating system.
7479228	7483509	Well, yeah, the rating system is shit anyway, but I knew what adoption was when I was 10.
7485630	7486430	I didn't, you know...
7488671	7489372	It doesn't matter.
7489492	7498397	I actually think the emailer has a wee bit of a point, but at the same time, it's no rating board's responsibility to fill the role of a parent.
7499618	7500999	And I don't know.
7501799	7502600	It's a really tough call.
7503360	7505882	I get this perspective a lot.
7506382	7515688	Even though you might have known what it was when you were 10, I can see where maybe there wasn't enough warning that, hey, there might be some jokes that are going to go over a 10-year-old's head.
7516608	7519410	and maybe this game really should be only played by teens and up.
7519450	7520271	Like, I gotta be honest.
7520731	7522253	Would I let my kid play Portal?
7523053	7523314	I would.
7523534	7523894	I don't know.
7524034	7525235	Yeah, I don't think it's really dangerous.
7525455	7528878	But that's... But then again, I don't have these sensitivities to watch out for.
7528898	7531000	I got a baby to stop crying by playing Portal 2.
7532041	7532601	Seriously.
7533021	7541048	Dan's cousin was over here and her baby was crying in her lap so I asked if I could hold him and then I held him while I was playing Portal 2 in my lap and he thought it was amazing.
7541548	7542989	Let me put it this way as far as this email goes.
7543470	7544751	It's a fair argument.
7544991	7546152	I'm just not sure I agree.
7546312	7548854	But I think it's a valid counterpoint.
7549235	7549655	I'll give you that.
7550484	7551004	I can see it.
7551385	7554046	I mean, I honestly think that they should just rate them the way they do movies.
7554726	7566512	Then people would get it because apparently, I honestly think that a lot of people, especially ones who are not gamers and that are parents now, don't want to understand it.
7567152	7570754	They want other people to do their thinking for them and that's not acceptable.
7571395	7575697	So honestly, if you've got to answer a difficult question because you didn't do any research into the game, guess what?
7575777	7576157	That's on you.
7578035	7578515	Tricky Tricky.
7579355	7580156	Is there more to the email?
7581116	7581536	We have one more.
7582036	7582596	Yay, one more.
7583997	7585097	Another one through the website.
7585917	7589318	I was picking the short ones.
7589378	7595920	A few shows ago you picked this old game called Phantasmagoria.
7596060	7598441	I remember playing it when I was 15 and absolutely loved it.
7598941	7601161	Soon after that I played Gabriel Knight, The Beast Within.
7601641	7607083	After thinking back of those games, I started to wonder if there are any recent games out there that are point-click horrors.
7607703	7611426	All I've seen so far are mysteries and unfortunately it's more aimed at children.
7611506	7612647	I want my horror and gore.
7612807	7613347	Sad face.
7613407	7614248	Toodles, Syl.
7615148	7615889	I love Syl.
7615969	7616609	Yeah.
7616789	7619791	Syl lived in Amsterdam.
7619831	7627256	I don't know if she was in the capital of Holland, but she was in Dutch country and then she moved to Britain not that long ago.
7627276	7629698	She's not in London, but she's in another part of the country.
7630298	7632180	And yeah, we had her on Horde House a couple weeks ago.
7632480	7635502	She hosts the Girls Gone Wow podcast, which is a lot of fun.
7635862	7637023	You should go on that show.
7638144	7640948	Except at the time they tape, it's probably like 3 a.m.
7640988	7641428	over here.
7642389	7645934	If they do it on a weekend and I don't have school the next day, then whatever.
7646134	7647716	But anyway, back to the question itself.
7648297	7649158	Phantasmagoria.
7649979	7651501	Yeah, there really hasn't been a game like that in a long time.
7651802	7655947	The Silent Hill game on Wii was kind of point-and-clicky, but not quite.
7656327	7657748	I'm gonna do a quick bit of research, hold on
7673800	7679322	But yeah, I mean, if you want to go to the console side, I mean, Silent Hill games still have the gore and the fun stuff.
7679362	7681623	And not just Silent Hill, but Resident Evil.
7682324	7685065	What are some of the other big horror franchise series we have?
7685105	7686665	Point and click games, scary games.
7687426	7689166	We have Monster Basement 2.
7689987	7700711	We have Abandoned 2, Dead End Hotel, Haunted Trap Soul, Orchestrated Death, Inculation, Ex Mortis 3, which looks pretty gory, The Holes.
7701693	7704356	Crime Evidence 2, you know what actually game was kind of scary?
7704596	7710842	Dead Space This is actually at pointandclickgames.com You know what else actually, remember The Room?
7711643	7717548	Thank you, Salacious Pop is jumping up and down in chat I have to say this, Amnesia, because I was thinking of that game too I'm like, what's that game that was on Steam on sale?
7717588	7726177	But you had Amnesia Yeah, Amnesia is supposed to be a scary as hell title that's on PCs I would check out Amnesia for sure And that's a point and click?
7728086	7729971	Do you remember the little flash game that's called The Room?
7730292	7731154	Or Crimson Room?
7731374	7732637	Or something like that, Rob?
7733479	7733960	Do you remember that?
7735324	7736065	I'm sorry, one more time.
7736086	7736948	Sorry, I was catching up on chat.
7737264	7737785	Don't Shit Your Pants
7764600	7789071	that's a whole other type of I'll see if I can find it in the chat room but that one, it wasn't really so much of a scary game per se but it was sort of like kind of imagining yourself in that situation made it frightening that's what I thought was interesting about it I love that game by the way, don't shit your pants, it's a great game is that it for emails?
7789951	7791692	okay, I think I actually found it, The Scarlet Room
7794457	7797259	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.
7797559	7798820	Don't be butthurt if you don't get through, though.
7799120	7799480	It happens.
7799880	7800601	There's also the forums.
7800761	7803362	Nobody freaking posts on the Orange Lounge Radio forums, and I think we need to fix that.
7803603	7805884	We need to make that our mission this year to have some hopping forums.
7806444	7808706	So we need to encourage more discussion on the forums.
7808906	7809746	We're going to work on that.
7810907	7812748	Anyhow, that's it for the mailbag, yes?
7813949	7820173	All right, we're going to get into a game tonight, and we're going to do this with predictions.
7820353	7823955	And we're going to do this in the style of an old board game called Taboo.
7824440	7825221	Remember the game Taboo?
7825921	7831966	In Taboo, there were certain phrases that you wanted to say, but there were certain things that you didn't want to say.
7832487	7835809	So the OLR hosts, we're going to go around right now and give our predictions.
7836210	7842094	Five things you will see at E3 and five things you won't see at E3.
7843055	7863589	so for everything that you will see at E3 that is indeed announced that host will earn a point now see we can't tally this up till later in the week but for everything that you won't see that they do say there's going to be a buzz and that host will lose the point and the host with the most points by whenever we have another show next Sunday after next will win tacos
7865174	7865594	Yay!
7866995	7867975	They'll have to buy themselves.
7868215	7868375	Yes.
7868815	7871336	No, if it's not me, I will buy tacos.
7871496	7873337	If I win, then Jamie has to make me tacos.
7873937	7874217	Alright.
7875837	7876958	So, here we go.
7877098	7881699	Five things we think will happen, and five things that won't happen.
7882039	7886020	Let's start with the wills, and we'll start with DarkSakura.
7886400	7888781	Something you will see at E3 this year.
7889361	7891202	Microsoft will announce a Halo game for Kinect.
7892056	7892476	New Super Mario Bros.
7892496	7892916	Sequel Announced
7919745	7920786	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
7937225	7938926	Sony will talk about network security.
7962023	7963605	Sony will talk about network security.
7963746	7963966	Yes.
7964427	7969073	They'll talk about how great their online is now and all that.
7969254	7970596	They're going to toot their own horn some more.
7971317	7972338	Talk about how they're the safest.
7972398	7974101	It's going to be Sony auto fellatio.
7977717	7978458	Alright, fair enough.
7979259	7981082	Loki, something you will see.
7981863	7984267	A new Grand Theft Auto sequel will be announced.
7985549	7987151	Once again, playing it very safe.
7987331	7987952	Alright, that's right.
7988072	7989815	A new Grand Theft Auto sequel announced.
7989855	7990195	Fair enough.
7991718	7992779	I'm going to go out on a limb.
7992839	7993500	See, I'm going crazy.
7994261	8002352	I'm gonna say that the hardcore Wii title that is going to get you back to playing Nintendo I think it's gonna be Star Fox.
8003013	8007358	I think a new Star Fox game will be announced for the new whatever console it is.
8008159	8009701	I think if the whole...
8010442	8013203	DarkSakura They're going to verify the name of the new PSP The what?
8040146	8042467	of the new handheld PlayStation.
8042607	8044128	They're going to verify the name.
8044648	8044848	Yes.
8044888	8046009	This is already leaked.
8046489	8053452	I've said they were going to announce it before I realized that it had been put out.
8054472	8055673	So I said they're going to verify it.
8056113	8056373	All right.
8057614	8079496	and I'm going to have to send you the list so you can yeah you'll have to send it to me so you can pile it and Loki you'll have to do that too IDK and if you guys want to throw out your ideas in chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com things you think will happen at E3 Loki I think that there will be a minor price drop on the Xbox 360 console and Kinect hardware announced
8081420	8082622	So like a bundle thing?
8082842	8086806	No, I'm saying they're going to drop the price of the system and they're also going to drop the price of the Kinect.
8088528	8089550	Interesting, okay.
8090391	8091472	Try to get more people on board?
8091712	8096278	Yeah, exactly, because that's what they're pushing, so it makes sense that they would try to drop the price of the console down.
8097799	8097939	Alright.
8097959	8099021	Because the last drop was...
8101482	8102903	Thanks for watching!
8117029	8143313	absolutely not Star Wars because we've already had that and I think this time they've already done like some of the other big franchises so I think this time Soul Calibur 5 will have Capcom and I'm saying this because of the whole kind of we see them working together in Tekken cross Street Fighter and Street Fighter cross Tekken the one that comes to mind right away Dante I think Dante will be a character in Soul Calibur 5 that's my prediction okay two more Dark Sakura
8145759	8147600	Mine was more Portal 2 download content.
8148981	8151083	More Portal 2 download content.
8152124	8152444	Alright.
8152844	8155987	Oh, like Valve will show off the user creator stuff?
8156247	8157228	Yeah, there'd be that.
8157288	8158889	Maybe new maps that they did.
8162291	8162972	More fun.
8163432	8163713	Alright.
8164553	8164813	Loki?
8166575	8169837	This is kind of retarded, but new Animal Crossing game announced.
8170638	8173060	Oh, so you think that's going to be the Nintendo title that comes out the gate?
8173260	8174601	That'll be a 3DS title for sure.
8177453	8179034	Oh, you think it'll be a 3DS thing?
8179294	8179474	Yeah.
8180314	8180654	All right.
8182735	8183215	Let's see.
8184335	8200081	I'm going to say that Valve will show Defense of the Ancients 2, which I think is a risky pick for me because I think Valve has pretty much said they're not showing anything already, but I kind of think this game is ready to be shown more of because it's kind of their next big thing they've got in the pipeline, so I think Defense of the Ancients 2 is going to show up at E3.
8201761	8204022	and one more prediction to round out the five.
8204603	8205223	DarkSakura.
8205343	8206964	Ooh, I broke from IRC.
8207124	8207404	Darn it.
8207764	8208284	DarkSakura.
8210566	8215288	There was... Well, Loki already said it, but it was on my list, so I'm going to say it anyway.
8215328	8216608	An Xbox 360 price drop.
8219270	8219650	That's fine.
8219710	8221811	If somebody's list is duplicated, that's fine.
8222931	8227113	In fact, I will say one of the things that you said will show at E3, I have in my will not.
8227614	8228794	So this is going to get interesting.
8229615	8230235	Alright, um...
8232046	8234068	My... Oh, sorry, Loki, you're fifth and final.
8235089	8241134	DS Titles on the new Nintendo system will be on their virtual console or download service, whatever the hell they're going to call it.
8241674	8242795	Say it, virtual console.
8243036	8246258	So, DS Titles on new Nintendo system, virtual console.
8249581	8257248	Sorry, Blackwolf posted in chat a picture from E3, and I saw those same creatures in what Miklatov sent me.
8257288	8258469	Those are the Rage creatures.
8259028	8264313	Yeah, I saw there was a thing on Kotaku where they were all boxed up or whatever, and they're setting them up.
8264694	8265875	Okay.
8266115	8270039	My last one on my list is, I'm going to go for kind of an easy one.
8270840	8272562	Nintendo will demo 3D Netflix.
8273163	8278108	I think this is a big thing that they're going to be showing at E3, and they're going to be showing 3D Netflix.
8278528	8279289	Did we disconnect?
8280630	8281151	I think we did.
8281351	8282252	My Win app has crashed.
8283793	8307300	I'm still on IRC Hold on, we're going to keep recording for the sake of the podcast But we are not broadcasting right now Hold on, just keep going I think I'm still up No, I know you guys are connected The Winamp crashed over here That's what's wrong I'll say something in the chat room Okay Good old live radio and the pitfalls of it Okay, we should be connected again
8309680	8311841	So to recap, do you have all your five written down?
8311881	8314483	Let's recap the five things we think will happen.
8314523	8315723	So DarkSakura, your list again.
8316744	8329311	A Halo game for Kinect, network security from Sony, verifying the name of the PSP, or whatever, NGP, Vitamin, more Portal 2 download content, and Xbox 360 price drop.
8330191	8332832	Okay, Loki, the five things you said will happen.
8333073	8357906	In no particular order, minor press drop on the Xbox 360 console and Kinect hardware, a new Animal Crossing game announced, a new Grand Theft Auto game announced, and a new Super Mario game announced, and I mean like a new Super Mario Brothers, because that's kind of confusing and redundant, and then DS titles on the new Nintendo system virtual console.
8358516	8360917	Okay, and then my list of five things you will see.
8361298	8363259	Diablo 3 announced for a console.
8363899	8366461	Star Fox announced as the hardcore Wii title.
8366761	8369342	The Soul Calibur V bonus characters are Capcom inspired.
8369402	8370183	Think Dante.
8370703	8374045	Valve will show Defense of the Ancients 2 and Nintendo will demo 3D Netflix.
8374585	8377067	Okay, so let's go to the five things you won't see.
8377227	8380469	So if these things are said, the host loses a point.
8380509	8382070	They get buzzed like in Taboo.
8382810	8383010	So...
8384111	8387252	Let's see what the five things that we're putting on the card that they won't say.
8387372	8388593	DarkSakura, what's your first one?
8388813	8390113	No Final Fantasy VII Remake.
8391574	8392874	I think that's a very safe bet.
8392974	8397055	Everyone puts that on the I want to see it list every year and it's not going to happen.
8397476	8397676	Yep.
8398236	8398836	I think that's a good one.
8400396	8403761	Alright, so yep, no Final Fantasy VII.
8404081	8404362	Loki?
8405283	8408848	This would make me sad, but no Excite Truck sequel.
8410270	8411091	Probably not going to happen.
8412513	8417559	I actually put on my list, Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outage directly.
8418757	8419877	DarkSakura, your next one.
8445345	8450029	My next one is, and this makes me sad, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 will not be announced.
8451910	8452170	Nothing.
8453271	8453591	Loki?
8455673	8463839	I was going to say the new Nintendo I don't even know if they're going to announce the price, but the new Nintendo system will not be under $250.
8466457	8468500	Now that's a good guess.
8468760	8469622	What do you think it will cost?
8469762	8469622	$299?
8470102	8471524	I think it's going to be $299.
8471605	8473307	The controllers are going to be a lot more expensive.
8475010	8477994	Prices are going to be difficult, but they're going to have to justify it somehow.
8478280	8479201	I think the controllers will be $79.
8479501	8479201	$79.99.
8479681	8483244	$79.99 and they're going to be half a DS.
8485886	8489268	My list, my number two thing on things you won't see, Killer Instinct.
8489489	8489769	Sorry.
8491330	8493231	File that in the fanboy wank category too.
8493512	8496234	And there's been rumblings this year that it's supposed to come back.
8496254	8496494	No.
8497214	8497355	No.
8497995	8501838	Enjoy your Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter remakes and all this because that's as good as it's going to get.
8502358	8502819	DarkSakura?
8503499	8505080	No new Microsoft or Sega system.
8506121	8506662	Ha ha ha ha!
8508197	8514986	Well, you know, people, there's rumors every year about a Microsoft portable, so DarkSakura's saying, nope, not happening.
8515567	8515847	Loki?
8517830	8522476	Um... I would have to say probably that they're...
8524711	8532441	There's not going to be the 1 vs. 100 type thing anymore.
8532781	8536146	They're not going to announce some sort of community gaming type thing.
8536306	8537167	No more community games.
8537848	8538569	Okay, fair enough.
8540244	8562525	I'm gonna say that one thing you won't see a Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you will see big pushes on 13 2 instead they're gonna just it's not that they're gonna try to erase that 14 ever happened but they're gonna push 13 2 before they try to revisit 14 I think DarkSakura Sega will make a good Sonic game that's something you won't see yep
8565057	8565617	That's a good one.
8566298	8568699	That's going to be hard to see.
8568739	8570981	We'll have to see what the feedback is on the show floor, I suppose.
8571421	8571981	All right, Loki?
8574123	8576084	You will not see a new Dance Masters game.
8579306	8580046	Probably not.
8581988	8585850	Would you go so far as to say you will not see a non-DDR Konami dance game?
8588487	8614379	uh a non-DDR Konami dance game yes I would say I go that far okay all right uh funny enough my number four is about a music game as well I don't think you're gonna see a DJ game from Harmonix and when I say DJ game from Harmonix I mean one that involves a turntable controller because it could be that the new obviously whatever Harmonix makes is going to be music based but I don't want that interpretation to be too loose I'm talking turntable and keys not happening
8615399	8618322	I think Harmonix is going to go somewhere new with something you haven't thought of.
8620644	8623107	And let's see, DarkSakura, let's wrap up the list.
8623147	8623607	Number five.
8624068	8625149	Duke Nukem booth dudes.
8626890	8628912	As in, like, you know, scantily clad men.
8630434	8631795	What if there is a Duke Nukem?
8632416	8632916	Would that count?
8632936	8633597	That doesn't count.
8633677	8633997	All right.
8634578	8636800	I said, like, you know, like, scantily clad dudes.
8637280	8637941	Okay, fair enough.
8638522	8638702	Loki?
8640293	8647740	This is going to be kind of a risky one, but... And not including, because I know that these are coming out, because I look at this kind of stuff.
8648240	8657489	Not including these greatest hits, re-releases, or third-party games.
8657569	8661412	You will not see any new first-party PSP games.
8662774	8664755	No new first-party PSP games.
8664816	8665136	That's a...
8665942	8667863	And I'm talking about actual UMD discs.
8667943	8670285	I'm not talking about some stupid download content.
8670385	8674148	I'm talking first party UMD PSP games.
8676069	8680973	BlackWolf in our chat is calling shenanigans on the fact that you have a Konami thing on your list and they already did a press conference.
8681493	8685096	However, I'm actually going to back you up because that doesn't mean it was everything.
8685416	8688018	Because we don't know what Nintendo's got.
8688258	8691200	And anything that Konami's making for the new Nintendo system is under wraps.
8693451	8698653	and I would stand by the fact that just because they didn't say it in their little pre thing doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
8699013	8701933	Like Glee Karaoke Revolution wasn't in their thing.
8702134	8703654	Guarantee you there's another one of those coming.
8704674	8708895	So I'm going to allow it even though it's probably a safe bet.
8709256	8710436	It will still count for tacos.
8711277	8719406	Alright, and my last answer, this is a duplicate and it's a painful one, but I also put, you will not see Half-Life Anything.
8719646	8720227	Sorry, Alan.
8721288	8722309	I actually wrote it just like that.
8722389	8723090	Half-Life Anything.
8723190	8723691	Sorry, Alan.
8724548	8726249	Yeah, I thought of Alan when I put that on there.
8727169	8739816	But when I was at work, I would plug in my little iPhone and listen to all the dialogue through Half-Life 2, through all the episodes.
8740896	8742517	And that's how I got through Half-Life.
8743197	8743458	Nice.
8743578	8747620	Because I didn't really play much at home, so I got to hear the entire game.
8747740	8749060	So I was like, I want more!
8749300	8749881	What happens? !
8750521	8755922	All right, let's recap the five buzz things, the things that will cause a host to lose a point if it happens.
8756102	8756643	DarkSakura.
8757903	8769246	My list, dun-dun-dun, is no Final Fantasy VII remake, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 will not be announced, no new Microsoft or Sega systems, Sega will make a good Sonic game, and Duke Nukem booth dudes.
8770306	8770466	Loki?
8770486	8770566	Loki?
8772277	8774179	The Excite Truck sequel is not happening.
8774820	8778003	The Nintendo system will not be under $250.
8778864	8784650	No community games on 1 vs. 100 stuff.
8785011	8789115	No Dance Masters game or non-DDR dancing game from Konami.
8789956	8793480	And no first-party PSP UMD games.
8796118	8814473	Alright, and on my list of five things you won't see, Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outage directly, Killer Instinct, Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3, you'll see big pushes on 13.2 instead, you will not see a DJ game from Harmonix, meaning one with a turntable and buttons, and you will not see Half-Life anything.
8814893	8815414	Sorry, Alan.
8816926	8818266	All right, so we'll see what develops.
8819246	8822127	Next week, I've got to bring in the actual buzzer when we do the recaps.
8822147	8824107	Uh-oh.
8824327	8824767	We've got one.
8825227	8827868	Sounds of Failure has the Family Feud buzzer.
8828128	8832549	Oh, yeah, there's the sound effects thing that Tyra Claw gave me like a year ago with all the failures.
8832569	8835309	You know, I use that on Tonic Insanity.
8836009	8837129	We use it for Dan Shadow.
8837149	8839030	Every time he makes a joke, we play Sad Trombone.
8841510	8842070	Oh, yeah, there it is.
8842130	8842890	It's bookmarked right here.
8842950	8844711	Sound Effects of Failure.
8844871	8845871	So here you go.
8849621	8850121	Oh, sorry.
8850181	8852942	So when they say, hey, it's a Sonic game that doesn't suck.
8853282	8854483	Oh, DarkSakura.
8856723	8860725	I like that when you click it, then it does the X. That's funny.
8860925	8861926	I like the toilet flush too.
8862486	8862786	All right.
8863586	8865347	Anyhow, let's move on.
8865387	8872570	We got to get the FUs of the week done because if we don't get our angst out, then I don't know what happens, but something bad.
8887803	8889184	I accidentally kicked Loki.
8889484	8889784	Oops.
8889964	8891665	I tried to voice him and kicked him instead.
8892485	8896207	Um, fuck you to Sally Hansen's Miracle Nail Thickener.
8896967	8905231	It doesn't work and it bubbles and it stinks really bad too, so thank you Sally Hansen Company for taking $5 of my money.
8906171	8906591	Fuckers.
8908252	8915055	And also fuck you to feeling like crap in my intestines all day from eating all those delicious cupcakes last night.
8916434	8917154	Damn it, Rob.
8917214	8919315	Why'd you have to bring those delicious orange cupcakes?
8919595	8921276	They were orange creamsicle cupcakes.
8921376	8924357	I knew you would love them because they tasted like the blood orange Pinkberry.
8924957	8925658	They were better.
8926298	8927598	Well, they were a little sweeter.
8927618	8928619	They tasted like creamsicles.
8929199	8932220	By the way, I'm writing a high this week because Pinkberry tweeted me this week.
8932620	8936742	And they did tell me the blood... They told me personally on Twitter the blood orange will be back.
8938308	8938668	DarkSakura.com
8953999	8955259	God, I wish they didn't close at 10 on Sundays.
8955279	8958420	All right, my FU of the week goes to lack of Pinkberry.
8959120	8967122	My FU of the week goes to the thing freezing up and dumping the listeners for like 10 minutes and I didn't even realize it because we weren't connected in chat still.
8967842	8972083	And my FU of the week goes to me for not trying harder to do E3 this year.
8972123	8974523	I think in retrospect I probably should have done it.
8975203	8979464	I'm really looking forward to this whole coverage and kind of trying something different.
8979904	8991564	But, I don't know, it's going to be sad kind of missing all the atmosphere of E3 But at the same time, my wallet says, thank you But, Disneyland I know, there is Disneyland, that's going to rock It's a small world
8992987	8993928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9021545	9026368	and me who gets bad vertigo and hates roller coasters can do California Screamin' just fine.
9026728	9028209	And then, or Tower of Terror.
9028829	9030370	I cannot, no, I can't do Tower of Terror.
9031330	9032030	I tried Tower of Terror.
9032050	9033271	I'll take Bobby on Tower of Terror.
9033491	9034532	Dan will go on Tower of Terror.
9035652	9036973	I love Tower of Terror.
9037013	9039094	Dan's in the other room saying, I'll go on Tower of Terror twice.
9039274	9041275	Dan, I scream like a girl on Tower of Terror.
9042976	9048579	No, when I came off of Tower of Terror, I was so dizzy that I could not walk straight, okay?
9049531	9050452	Back to FUs of the week.
9050472	9050912	Sorry, Loki.
9051412	9053353	FU to Disneyland talk.
9055233	9058235	I guess... I don't know.
9058995	9062196	FU not being able to go to E3, because I really would have liked to have gone to E3.
9063256	9067238	Not necessarily to be able to see all the wonderful booths and stuff, because I'd be in my own hotel room.
9067418	9069679	Being able to sleep all night long.
9070639	9072760	Oh, how I wish I could sleep all night long.
9072780	9075001	You should have thought about that before you had a baby.
9075021	9075361	Sorry.
9076812	9077392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9098570	9125778	but it's a given that babies wake up at 3 in the morning hungry or poopy or have to pee or that they want mommy all the time not really actually all of our friends don't have a problem with that it's baby nature it's just that our child decides hey you know what I need to be swaddled still at 10 months I wake up at 3 in the morning sometimes screaming whatever you know we moved him into his own room so that's also an additional bit of fun um
9127100	9127520	and DarkSakura.
9154679	9156661	Yes, so this is kind of cool.
9157302	9168193	You know, there's been a lot of rumors that there's going to be gaming coming to the Apple TV device, but everyone seems to forget, hey, you know what, there's other things out there that you can stream movies onto.
9168833	9178042	And now Rovio is actually negotiating with developers to create games specifically for their Roku box.
9178963	9208267	and it will I guess be TV based games you know casual stuff and they haven't really said how the controller is going to work I guess it may be the new boxes or whatever can come with a controller but it's kind of neat though to see the gaming is coming to everything I mean I'm sure it won't be long before we're just you know having internet enabled TVs that you're playing games off of without any sort of additional software yeah on live
9210510	9212473	Without any additional software.
9212713	9213574	Well, the boxes.
9213874	9214695	Well, I understand that.
9214715	9216838	I'm talking about internet-enabled TVs.
9217058	9217619	Alright, alright.
9218139	9218440	Whatever.
9221218	9223340	Alright, so would you be interested in a Roku box?
9223520	9223641	No.
9224301	9224882	I had a feeling.
9226203	9226563	Why would I?
9226944	9227604	There's no reason.
9228906	9229226	Alright.
9231128	9231749	Let's move on.
9232229	9234852	You poor guys are bullying Bobby into writing the ride.
9234932	9235312	No, no.
9235552	9241699	I'm just being honest because keep in mind the first time I read California Screamin' I wrote it in the middle and got sick as fuck.
9242671	9245556	At least we'll go on Toy Story Midway Mania and that ride is amazing.
9245596	9245816	It is.
9246136	9251064	But when I started riding California Screamin' in the front car, never got sick again.
9252126	9254589	But it's the same like being in the front seat of the car.
9255290	9257354	I get motion sick in the back seat but in the front seat I'm fine.
9258755	9261016	All right, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
9261036	9264617	This story is about Animal Crossing, but it might not be what you're expecting.
9265318	9271800	It's a story that Kotaku ran earlier this week, and I guess it was kind of from another site called AntiPixelante.com.
9272741	9273501	Here's the deal.
9273721	9275282	It's a story about...
9277492	9279094	I don't even know where to go here with Animal Crossing.
9298795	9307359	So these people at AntiPixelante actually combed the website to find what Animal Crossing characters were most popular on Rule 34.
9308459	9318203	And believe it or not, there were 59 pornographic images of the Stitch Lady that helps you do the cross, make your own patterns.
9318223	9319003	It was named Hazel?
9319464	9320084	Yeah, Hazel.
9320544	9324648	So Hazel was the most popular character with 59 pornographic images.
9325308	9329992	Next up, and I'm surprised he wasn't number one, Tom Nook was second place with 30.
9331013	9334836	And then the other, well, it's Abel and Mabel or something like that, isn't it?
9334976	9335777	The Abel sisters.
9335857	9336658	The Abel sisters.
9336698	9337939	The other Abel sister had 15.
9338019	9338539	Mabel and Sable.
9339660	9342043	and then KK whatever he is.
9342063	9342904	So did KK.
9343144	9343304	Was 13.
9344906	9347009	And then I don't even know who that last chick is at 9.
9347309	9349311	That's the hair style.
9349371	9350212	Oh, it's the hair lady.
9350252	9350493	Alright.
9350853	9353957	Now, if you want to know what animals showed up the most.
9353977	9355118	That raccoon cock.
9358441	9361844	This actually gives me a whole new incentive to play Animal Crossing again.
9362124	9364506	I want to make the most offensive village possible.
9365467	9366768	We almost did that with mine.
9367168	9367488	Remember?
9368589	9369470	I had the town lesbian.
9371051	9373112	And we had people running around saying cocksucker.
9374834	9379457	Yes, they show this posting of a board where somebody has written, you know how you can write your own messages on the board in town?
9379977	9380758	Nook special.
9381078	9382880	We've got a very special item in today.
9383180	9385201	Yes, it's Nook's fat raccoon cock.
9385482	9387203	Come check it out at Nookington's.
9390003	9393685	Anyhow, what villagers were most shown in compromising positions?
9393985	9397848	Believe it or not, 15 different cats compromising 138.
9397968	9402630	Tabby was number one at 36 porno images.
9403691	9405572	Am I really reporting on this of Tabby?
9405612	9406393	I think you are.
9407854	9416281	Six different wolves, 111 humans, four different elephants, ten bunnies, nine squirrels, and seven dogs.
9416681	9418723	Dogs only shown 20 times.
9418823	9422366	The mummy dog was in seven different pornographic images.
9423106	9425989	Well, people like the bandaged up people.
9430712	9432194	I don't know what to say about that anymore.
9433194	9433675	I'm looking.
9433815	9434836	God bless the internet.
9434856	9436057	That's the only thing I can think of.
9438460	9440223	I'm trying to find where the pictures are.
9440864	9442005	The actual pictures are not there.
9442045	9445269	You have to go to that Rule 34 and I'm a little afraid to go to that site.
9445670	9446331	Alright, fine.
9446351	9446851	You know what?
9446911	9447172	Fine.
9447292	9448734	I will fucking go to Rule 34.
9451377	9453180	Only because I'm on Jamie's computer.
9454341	9456802	My computer, that's the Orange Lounge computer.
9456822	9458602	That's the one that our listeners built us.
9458782	9460582	Okay, then I'm going on the listener computer.
9461243	9463263	Let's see, what is this website here?
9464743	9465423	Rule 34, there we go.
9465483	9467784	And I'm going to copy.
9467804	9470364	I'm just really afraid of what I'm about to see when I go to this website.
9470384	9472005	This could be worse than Two Girls, One Cup.
9474045	9475386	And I'm waiting for it to load.
9476666	9478286	There's an Animal Crossing movie?
9479046	9480307	And let's see, okay, I'm going to search.
9480607	9482067	Oh yeah, I have that already.
9483527	9484450	Do they have it subtitled?
9485292	9486677	I think I've got it subtitled somewhere
9488298	9492342	TigerCon chatroom says, Sky, you do realize what you're getting yourself into, furry porn.
9493623	9502271	Look, it's my job to be an objective reporter, and if there's news out there... I'm the one that posted that link.
9502371	9503752	We always gotta have something pornographic.
9503772	9504913	What did you want to say about it?
9505333	9506174	What I want to say about it?
9507515	9508416	Typical internet.
9508436	9509137	I mean, come on.
9509617	9513000	Seriously, if it's gonna be a character, they're gonna have sex with somebody.
9514318	9516999	This stupid website's timing out, I think, because we're trying to do a show.
9517019	9519020	Like, I'm searching for Animal Crossing and nothing's happening.
9519380	9520400	There's images, though.
9521841	9527823	Someone on Yahoo Answers said... What was it?
9528603	9530064	Actually asked to see if it had been done yet.
9533625	9535005	This website kind of sucks.
9535025	9538587	Well, on the... There's a Rule 34 with two ad-ads doing it.
9542242	9547225	This is great.
9550327	9551047	All right, forget it.
9551067	9552588	This segment's going nowhere.
9552608	9555790	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9556170	9558692	If you want to give us a call, we will chat about whatever.
9558752	9560573	Please not Rule 34, for the love of God.
9560973	9564135	Again, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9564495	9566356	Meanwhile, how about last-minute stories?
9567337	9567677	Rob, look.
9568437	9596973	uh yeah uh apparently there's you know of course the Kinect Star Wars game is being shown um by the way the Kinect Star Wars game based on the video footage that we've seen so far looks very terrible uh lag-tastic fun uh also apparently there is going to be a uh Disneyland Adventures game for Kinect where you run around Disneyland and ride rides and stuff like that sounds like a game that you two would be picking up yeah
9601482	9602183	This is kind of awesome.
9602203	9602883	Wow, that's awful.
9603123	9606225	There is a modder for Super Smash Bros.
9606305	9612988	Brawl that made a mod for that replacing Solid Snake with Conan O'Brien.
9613808	9617590	In fact, he even does his string dance at the end of the round.
9618310	9619091	It's awesome.
9620051	9623233	I don't know if there's a place you can download that.
9626648	9650164	forms.kc-mim.com slash gallery slash brawl or slash brawlview.php question mark number 1000 I'm sure people are writing this down furiously well you know what they download the podcast and they can go back and rewind it and stuff like that and get everything number equals 19,277 alright or just go search on Kotaku you can find it interesting
9656076	9679820	also the Metal Gear and Zone of Enders those collections will actually be downloadable as well so if you don't want to purchase the box sets and maybe you only want one title in HD you can download those I believe separately so that's going to be kind of neat I found you subtitled Animal Crossing on YouTube and linked it to you awesome I will share it with everybody
9682105	9684806	And then, let's see, is that just the trailer or is that the whole movie?
9684986	9685846	Looks like it's the whole movie.
9686566	9688467	Very cool.
9689067	9689567	Let's see.
9689927	9692908	Also, I was going to talk about here.
9693908	9701351	Apparently, Mad Catz, you know, following the footsteps of Red Octane, are actually becoming game publishers themselves.
9701891	9707132	They have launched Thunderhawk Studios and they are developing a flight sim game.
9709833	9710013	Neat.
9712557	9717901	Okay, I did a search on the whole Animal Crossing and Tom Nook and nothing came up.
9717981	9721824	I found one image of Tom Nook and Tom Nook.
9722304	9723225	Did you go to 4chan?
9724906	9727949	I'm definitely not going there on DarkSakura's show computers.
9727989	9728929	I don't know what we'll affect it with.
9729170	9729590	We have a call.
9730491	9731351	We have a call.
9731471	9732472	Have fun digging through that.
9732732	9733113	We have a call.
9733153	9733993	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9734013	9734333	Who's this?
9735254	9737276	I'm just trying to stop all the Animal Crossing talk.
9737296	9737656	That's all.
9738957	9739537	Hi, Bobby.
9739557	9739958	How are you?
9741036	9741797	I'm doing good.
9741997	9743138	Are you excited for E3?
9743939	9747142	I don't know if I'm excited more for E3 or not going on California Screamin'.
9749264	9756831	Yeah, I'm trying to get them to stop picking on you, but you should be glad my friend Victoria isn't going because she says, I have a rule.
9757211	9761235	You go on every ride once, and if you don't like it, you never have to go on it again.
9761795	9763157	But I'm a little more forgiving.
9763197	9765599	If somebody says, no, Rob, I'm really not going on it, I'm like, okay, whatever.
9765619	9766019	I did that.
9766239	9766800	I'm not going to bully.
9767040	9771543	I went on Tower of Terror and it sucked.
9771563	9772504	I don't want Bobby to barf.
9772684	9774345	So if he's going to barf, he's not going on it.
9775045	9775706	I wouldn't barf.
9775746	9780129	What it is is I do have a medical condition and I will pass out.
9781207	9785048	and I don't want to pass out and Disney doesn't want me to pass out because then they escort you out of the park.
9785108	9790210	Yes, you will have to hydrate him and watch over him if he passes out because you forced him to go on that ride.
9791031	9793592	Alright, Dan's like, then we get to go backstage.
9794432	9802615	Alright, look, we're playing the little game tonight about things you will see and things you won't see at E3 and you're calling shenanigans on Loki's list, I know.
9803715	9803876	Yes.
9804016	9805497	So, Bobby, I'm going to put you on the spot.
9805537	9809359	I won't make you name five, but tell me something you think we will see, maybe that we missed.
9809639	9811020	Something we will see and something we won't see.
9812751	9819794	Well, I mean, the won't see is... Actually, I had a call on my show tonight that asked me, you know, what would you not see there?
9819814	9821015	And I said a new Space Quest.
9821695	9824957	Or really, any new Sierra adventure titles.
9825437	9826917	I think that's a pretty fair guess, yeah.
9827598	9832040	Because, I mean, I can't see Activision resurrecting King's Quest or anything like that.
9832060	9834901	Well, haven't we had the Telltale King's Quest games were announced?
9837042	9838263	Didn't that come out a few months ago?
9839063	9839923	Yeah, but we won't see it at E3.
9839943	9840003	Hmm.
9843514	9844495	I'm going to get my buzzer ready.
9846175	9846916	I'm not playing.
9847176	9849297	All right, all right, fine, fine.
9850418	9851178	We'll see, we'll see.
9851218	9852999	All right, what about something that will happen?
9854300	9855100	Something that will.
9855220	9863264	I'm, you know, it's kind of hard because, like, I've seen a lot of the stuff that, you know, kind of is going in and stuff.
9865365	9868747	What we will see, I think we will...
9870333	9870974	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9893511	9897133	Now what I want to see is I want to see them do Pac-Man vs. as one of the demo games.
9898373	9898913	They could.
9898953	9903235	They could re-release all that stuff that they did for the Game Boy Advance Kinect cable that nobody ever played.
9903255	9903875	They can?
9904296	9906276	They will because that's Nintendo.
9906577	9907437	Oh, well that's easy.
9907517	9908417	Let's do it that way.
9909058	9912339	The only one that probably wouldn't happen is Crystal Chronicles because that wasn't first party.
9912379	9913239	That was a weird game.
9913299	9914320	I liked it, but it was weird.
9915060	9916141	It wasn't really Final Fantasy.
9916161	9919082	It was just kind of in that storyline, I guess.
9920703	9925606	All right, well, any other thoughts for us, Bobby, before we talk to you again on Tuesday live from Los Angeles?
9926266	9932369	Okay, so I'm supposed to look for large chibis, and I'm supposed to look for Duke Nukem booth dudes.
9932729	9932929	Yes.
9933990	9935071	Okay.
9935111	9937592	So can I provide the buzzer if I find the booth dudes?
9937732	9938272	Yes, you can.
9938672	9944676	Because I have found, they usually do have somewhere the scantily clad muscular guys.
9944996	9945196	Right.
9946357	9949018	Now, the question is, are they going to be advertising Duke Nukem?
9949693	9950294	We'll find out.
9950514	9951395	So get that buzzer ready.
9951435	9954437	And yes, I give you full permission to buzz DarkSakura if that happens.
9955358	9957019	It's like you're going to buzz me, I'm sure.
9957139	9957520	All right, yes.
9959261	9960722	Did you go by Telltale's booth?
9962708	9964369	I don't think they have a booth.
9965330	9966690	I don't think they do at E3 either.
9967751	9968551	They do at PAX.
9969292	9972173	Yeah, they do PAX, but they don't get a booth at E3.
9973254	9977516	If there is a King Quest thing, they'd be probably shown at an Activision's booth because they own the IP.
9978037	9978717	Oh, that's right.
9978777	9979858	It's like a joint thingy.
9981138	9981338	Okay.
9981759	9983339	Well, Bobby, we'll talk to you more on Tuesday.
9983399	9984280	Have a safe flight tomorrow.
9985387	9987268	Thank you, and no more Rule 34 talk.
9987288	9987828	Come on, guys.
9987908	9988689	All right, we'll try.
9988769	9989449	Be professional.
9989669	9989969	We'll try.
9991670	9993291	How long have you been listening to this show?
9994112	9994952	About seven years.
9995332	9995633	All right.
9997173	9997854	Take care, Bobby.
9998254	10000235	See ya.
10000255	10000615	Bye.
10000635	10001456	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10001516	10004317	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to call and talk.
10005378	10005998	More porn talk.
10006038	10006398	No, I'm kidding.
10006418	10007519	What about more last-minute stories?
10007955	10014813	I want them to do an Animal Crossing that actually has a huge world like in the anime because I started watching anime and it's actually pretty good.
10016821	10017422	Ubisoft.
10018422	10018822	I'm sorry.
10018842	10022045	See, this is the type of thing I'd usually expect from Ubisoft.
10022345	10025527	But here's one of Activision's big announcements that they're going to be making.
10026228	10030971	Activision Publishing and Sega Toys, they have created Wappy Dog.
10031691	10036254	Wappy Dog is basically an AIBO ripoff for the Nintendo DS.
10037035	10042018	And it will allow you to interact with the robot dog in the game.
10042979	10044060	And you will be able to...
10045281	10047464	Does Wappy Dog come with Jacka Cat?
10050288	10051590	No, I don't think so.
10051610	10052852	That's what it sounds like to me.
10053593	10054394	Wappy Dog.
10054434	10055135	Wappy Dog.
10055896	10057238	Wappy Dog and Jacka Cat.
10062218	10069161	Other Ocean Interactive, they have announced that they're going to be working on a new project for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network based on the H.G.
10069201	10087929	Wells novel War of the Worlds and of course it's going to be following the events of the 1953 film and include a new story arc, characters, locations and subplots I'd actually be kind of cool to see something like this like Resistance style or something like that
10088868	10090288	As long as Tom Cruise isn't involved.
10090328	10092209	Let's go to the phones for another call.
10092649	10093569	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10093589	10093949	Who's this?
10095090	10095930	Legend of Zaku here.
10096110	10097210	Legend of Zaku.
10097310	10098171	What's up, my friend?
10099531	10100071	Nothing much.
10100431	10105453	Just getting ready for tomorrow's Case of the Mondays.
10105633	10107553	You going to sit back and watch the press conferences?
10107593	10108713	You going to have your popcorn?
10110094	10114095	Yeah, I'm going to be trying to browse it from my desk.
10114435	10114835	There you go.
10114855	10117996	I mean, I have two monitors, so I could probably pull it off on one of them.
10118948	10130877	But going on what I was trying to bring up tonight was the whole Call of Duty Elite thing, which is basically Activision's next shameless attempt at money-grabbing.
10131498	10133159	Hmm, I'm sensing you're not a fan.
10134120	10136762	No, I mean, I don't understand when other, like...
10138598	10149943	When other developers, other companies, you know, like Bungie and EA have offered these services for free, and Activision's mostly paywalling the good stuff, like videos.
10150843	10157807	I mean, what I'm sensing is that they are probably going to herald the next video game crash.
10158407	10166010	You think about it, and I bring this up because you think about how the first one happened and how this one might draw parallels to the one in 83.
10168206	10176309	Where you have one particular company just trying to rehash franchises to the point where quality degrades and fans get turned off.
10184442	10187604	I don't think another video game crash across the board is possible.
10187744	10189964	I think there is possible company failures.
10190145	10192766	I don't think forever you're going to have Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft.
10192806	10193726	One of them will fail.
10194486	10201269	You're getting to the point where Activision's literally watering down, diluting the entire first-person shooter genre.
10201909	10203109	If people, for the most...
10205502	10223611	for the most part consumers I'm not talking about the hardcore gamers the ones that consistently buy Call of Duty you know the ones that basically don't have other first-person shooters lined up aside from aside from like the side from Call of Duty Halo gears you know like the small really
10225261	10237511	I'm trying to put my finger on the demographic, but it's the type of person that wouldn't care less about what the scene thinks and more important, you know, just like instantly gratified by just explosions.
10237951	10239773	What about just like voting with your dollars?
10239793	10241754	You know, it's a concept we were talking about a lot.
10242435	10244777	I understand that it's possible, but when you have
10245936	10267112	When you have one company just giving negative connotations to one genre by just like trying to nickel and dime people every step of the way and just trying to like not really innovate then it's going to be harder for other titles to really stand out unless Battlefield 3 manages to pull an upset which I know it will because it has a lot to offer on the table.
10267532	10270414	And I think that, yeah, I don't think that's going to lead to a crash.
10270454	10280339	I think it would just be, yeah, Battlefield 3 might become the new champion, you know, or maybe... But then you might get to the point where video gamers are going to get sick and tired of actually having to deal with just mediocrity.
10280579	10286562	Okay, well, let me throw this question at you, kind of out of left field here, because you mentioned Halo as one of the games that you think has done it very well.
10286942	10289163	But we know that Activision and Bungie are partnering up.
10289283	10294706	I mean, Bungie was the first really to pioneer such a thing.
10295273	10300704	where they integrated the ability to look up your stats online and post the video straight from the console.
10301670	10306313	But Bungie and Activision are partnering up for whatever this next game is.
10306353	10307754	At least Activision is publishing it.
10307834	10314398	So do you think that the same nickel and dime extra stuff I don't really need thing is going to continue?
10315299	10316419	It's under Activision.
10316459	10318461	I mean, Microsoft didn't do that much.
10318601	10319781	Didn't even do any of that.
10320602	10324584	I know when Bungie was working with Microsoft, that never happened.
10325005	10330048	Because they were trying new ways to engage people into that genre, into that game.
10331243	10340975	and what better way than to launch the whole Halo Waypoint thing, I believe, where it allows you to interact, look up your scores, post it on Facebook.
10342099	10342739	and so forth.
10342799	10361612	But then when Activision is thrown into the mix, you have a company that's helping on just trying to monetize and maximize every single dollar out of all their IP to the point where they're willing to cut corners and sacrifice quality in the name of the almighty dollar.
10362112	10363032	Okay, let me ask this question.
10363052	10364453	We've got to wrap up and get more calls.
10364473	10365634	Let me ask this question and end on this.
10366154	10371578	What do you think they could do to make more money on the franchise that doesn't seem so nickel and dime?
10373206	10381469	Well, first of all, you shouldn't try to nickel and dime for things that have been offered for free in the past.
10382229	10387251	That whole Call of Duty Elite, many people have shrugged it off so far.
10388103	10398286	Because from what I heard, for example, on the other sites, like Otaku, for example, they basically wrote it off as just another money grab.
10398666	10403768	So they really have no hopes for this endeavor.
10404248	10404908	They really don't.
10405168	10411370	It doesn't phase them, it doesn't engage them that well, and that's getting a really lukewarm reception.
10413272	10418696	and more importantly, trying to create innovative ways to re-engage your customers.
10418796	10428262	Try not to rehash the same boring old five-hour campaign and instead offering new ways to offer balanced gameplay.
10429384	10436387	If they fix up the gameplay in multiplayer where it's not a camp fest, then they have a better shot.
10436827	10439107	We at least have one person agreeing with you in the chat room.
10439127	10444289	DarkToagak says, Activision is one shit of a company for lack of something less constructive to say.
10445950	10449111	Alright, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can try to get at least one more call tonight, but have a good one.
10449915	10450615	Alright, have a good one
10464929	10466850	Anything else you want to get out here, Loki, with last-minute stories?
10466950	10470153	Yes, Microsoft has officially announced what games they're going to be showing at E3.
10470213	10473735	This will be in their booth, including third-party stuff.
10474375	10475556	Some of it sounds interesting.
10476237	10478598	Let's see, starting off, some of these you've probably heard before.
10478898	10484562	Tomb Raider, Forza 4, Star Wars Connect, Gears of War 3, a Halo-related title.
10484642	10485863	I'm sure that's Halo Connect.
10486764	10490726	Codename Kingdoms, Sesame Street, Once Upon a Monster.
10491046	10494128	That's the new... What the fuck was it?
10496510	10513836	The new Double Fine game Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Steel Battalion Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is not supposed to be playable I wonder if maybe it's just a trailer That would be hot if they're showing that playable on the floor
10517192	10529188	Steel Battalion Heavy Armor, Alan Wake Night Springs, XCOM, Hitman Absolution, Modern Warfare 3, Spelunky HD, Ghost Recon,
10531410	10554126	Dance Central 2, Kinect Fun Labs, X-Commerce, Kinect Sports Season 2, Toy Soldier Cold War, Fable the Journey, Raving Rabbids for Kinect, another unspecified Double Fine game, Hybrid, which is an Xbox Live Arcade shooter, Roller Coaster Kinect, and Rise of Nightmares for Kinect.
10556028	10556188	Okay.
10557662	10560964	So, there's some of your announcements for E3.
10560984	10562265	Alright, let's go to the phones.

10582780	10585462	La La Lana finally has a Japanese release date.
10585642	10585742	Ha!
10587453	10588454	June 21st They're saying after E3
10605202	10606762	It's like Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night.
10606782	10607503	You've got this huge world and
10632276	10638380	I don't know, I mean I know the PC version is kind of hard but I hear they'll be adjusting that for the WiiWare version
10660373	10661193	Nintendo's new console.
10661353	10666876	I'm kind of curious to see what they've got going on with that.
10666896	10668096	If that were to actually happen, I'd die.
10668116	10672798	The show would be done because I would have died.
10685163	10703451	I think he just got chased out no he's talking with Dan they're having boy talk about something oh boys alright let's see so what would make you insanely happy if Nintendo announced on their new console like I've talked about I want an F-Zero game what game do you want?
10704871	10707592	I'm asking you don't even know
10712882	10713342	All of it.
10713483	10714163	I want them all.
10714944	10718126	I want an Animal Crossing porn game on the new cafe.
10718146	10718646	That's what I want.
10718666	10719047	I'm kidding.
10719067	10719407	I'm kidding.
10719447	10719827	There you go.
10719847	10721829	You know what?
10721929	10723910	An Animal Crossing... La Mulana HD.
10723990	10728293	An Animal Crossing game with the Nintendo games intact would be awesome.
10728513	10734498	And I'm not talking about a new... I'm talking about a new Animal Crossing game, not this like, hey, look, we ported the same damn game over...
10736033	10736313	All right.
10736653	10740276	All right, DT, I'm going to let you go so you can go slap Black Wolf with the trout in the chat room.
10740296	10742677	But thanks for calling, and I hope La Mulana comes out soon.
10742717	10743377	Yeah, no problem.
10743537	10743818	All right.
10744658	10744978	Take care.
10745459	10753323	Actually, I'm a little worried because if La Mulana comes out too soon, then Dark Tetsuya will never finish his series on Where Are They Now that he's doing for the website.
10753363	10754464	I don't even know who he's interviewing.
10754924	10755604	It's like a secret.
10756285	10761608	So he's found blasts from OLR's past to interview on our website throughout the next month.
10761628	10762769	It's going to be interesting.
10763729	10764069	There you go.
10764109	10765470	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10765490	10768971	1-877-GAME-OLR if you, I don't know, want to leave us a voicemail or whatever.

10775234	10776795	Or even DarkSakura?
10776815	10779076	Yeah, Carmageddon coming out as a download title.
10779896	10780096	Yay.

10784878	10786239	We may have something a little later, though.
10787439	10789340	Maybe something to stay tuned after the show for.
10789520	10789981	Yes, maybe.
10791263	10794184	All right, well, anyhow, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.
10794204	10796264	We'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts in just a moment.
10796284	10801485	But first, I just want to say, again, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and supporting our show.
10801565	10804525	Even though I'm a little bit sad panda, I'm not going to E3 this year.
10804565	10811207	The only reason I have been able to go to E3 in the years past is because of this show and you guys really kind of fueling that fire.
10811267	10812447	So thank you guys so much.
10812467	10817868	I'm looking forward to the coverage this week and just having fun with the news and giving it its proper skewering.
10818288	10820209	or FanboyWank, whatever it deserves.
10820309	10821130	We will see.
10823631	10826553	If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell friends about the show.
10827034	10829235	Tell folks on iTunes.
10830056	10831136	Leave us a nice five-star review.
10831176	10839822	By the way, there was an awesome five-star review left this week about somebody saying that he listened to the show when he was younger and he feels like he's kind of grown up with the show and I'm like, aw, warm buzzies.
10840342	10864968	so yeah leave us a nice review on iTunes you don't have to be warm fuzzy so if you don't want to or tell a friend that's what we really want just tell word of mouth is all we got we do not have a giant booth at E3 just spread the word of OLR we will be lucky if we're able to get within 50 feet of the building and you know we don't have any of the advertising dollars or whatever word of mouth is all we got so tell a friend about the show all right let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts DarkSakura your final thoughts I have to help someone move tomorrow
10867136	10871299	My final thought is I'm going to be making the popcorn and making Alan get up early to watch Microsoft's conference tomorrow.
10871379	10872119	Good times.
10873060	10875001	Loki.
10875361	10878003	Just looking forward to tomorrow and watching the conferences.
10878323	10881165	I'm really disappointed that Nintendo isn't tomorrow, but whatever.
10882306	10883787	Good things come to those who wait.
10885688	10889130	Which, by the way, I think our Winamp might have crashed again here.
10889910	10890671	That's just lovely.
10890771	10892712	Is people in chats complaining about the stream?
10893653	10895494	Because my Winamp has locked up yet again.
10897773	10898915	I'm just not having good luck today.
10900257	10901198	Yep, my app's locked.
10901218	10901839	We're down again.
10904062	10904763	Live radio.
10904843	10905884	I wouldn't have it any other way.
10909369	10910511	So let's try to reconnect.
10911993	10913796	Yeah, I think I'm about to get kicked.
10914739	10917000	I don't know, there's some type of hiccup in the line or something.
10917840	10919841	Ooh, I think your internet might just be down.
10919961	10920762	I can't even connect.
10924163	10924964	I'm still connected.
10925984	10928265	Let's go to a random website here.
10928425	10929886	I cannot get through on the server.
10931226	10932407	Yep, mine's working just fine.
10932547	10941971	Alright, so we're going to, actually what we're going to do, we're going to just, for the sake of the podcast, we'll play the credits, since we're pretty much done with the show anyway, and then we'll figure out what to do about our live listeners when we come back.
10942411	10943991	So, that's going to do it.
10944352	10952135	Thank you guys for listening to us on the podcast feed, and sorry it was a little bit of a mess tonight, but you can't really plan for things like random internet outages.
10952415	10953495	Good night, everybody.
10954116	10954836	See you Tuesday.
10955136	10956317	Tuesday at 7 o'clock.
