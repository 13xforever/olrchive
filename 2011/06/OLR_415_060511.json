pinball thing Let's go back to of course video games It's a big week for video games, I'm not sure if you heard The E3 convention is coming up this week We're going to be covering E3 I'm going to start off the show actually by talking about this and we'll get into our gaming week Our schedule is like so screwed up over the next couple weeks Because we didn't do a show last week We're doing a show tonight We're not doing a show next Sunday Because we're doing shows Tuesday and Wednesday This next week They are live E3 specials, different place They're not going to be at AllGames.com because there's other stuff going on And we also wanted to help you guys learn about our brand new Ustream channel Is now up and running Our username there is OrangeLounge More information will be available at OrangeLoungeTrader.com later this week And best of all, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf Who does the show before us here at AllGames Radio Will be joining us over the Tuesday and Wednesday nights To be talking about what he's observing at the show floor What's going on behind the scenes at the press conferences What Sony is filling five and a half hours with, pray tell, tomorrow night And then Miklotov is also going to be joining us They're both going to Nintendo's press thing And will get to fill us in on what it was like to play Whatever Nintendo's calling their new system Without a three and a half hour wait Or whatever long that line is going to be at E3 Which I am looking forward to not standing in It's very strange because it's not like I haven't been to E3 before I didn't go during the airport years But it's going to be interesting doing coverage from this end of things But I'm happy that we'll be able to produce something a lot more slick Where we'll be able to take your calls Have the live chat room which will still be in the same place Chat.OrangeLoungeTrader.com And let you guys interact with the E3 coverage And of course, give your feedback Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice And there will be voices here in the studio Voices on the E3 show floor And your voices out there all over the internet Aw man, I gotta wait until Tuesday For Nintendo, yeah Just so you guys know how it's all going down Tomorrow there is no expo The expo floor is not open But the E3 show kinda starts Because that's when the press conferences start Microsoft kicks it off in the morning Then Sony is going to be in the evening Scrunched in there, Ubisoft and EA Konami already happened Which we'll be getting to a little later We'll talk about what they talked about They're not doing their own conference Also I noticed left out Activision Unless I just completely overlooked it Which is possible, I'm sure somebody in the chat room Will jump in with that if I may say They also tend to usually have a lot of announcements Like Call of Duty will usually be shown as Sony Or Microsoft's conference It's like, woah, I've never seen that before on these Consoles, yeah My thought too is that Activision kinda really blew their load Last year with that whole Eminem, Rihanna All those celebs they paraded out On stage for DJ Hero 2 Which then, well you know It didn't end up doing so hot Although it was a fine game, I enjoyed DJ Hero 2 Yeah, here I was asking Because my boss is going, actually my boss And our vice president of sales The guy Doesn't know anything about gaming So he's going to E3 Awesome, anyway So they're going, now it's like so you guys going to any of the Parties or anything while you're there It's like, no, it's not anything like You know, when they had the DJ Hero 2 Thing where they had like, you know, people DJing And Eminem and stuff like that They're having, I don't remember which Publisher it is, but someone's having a Bowling night Nice, nice, Black Wolf Our good pal is in our chat room saying Activision has a booth, but they don't have a concert So it is, yeah Whatever their big announcement is might be at one Of the other press conferences, I think you're right on with that So we'll say They don't have really any big announcements They've got to be this year They've got to give us more details on the Bungie thing Because right now, all they've got coming out Well, they've announced everything up through the third quarter As of last week So they haven't announced their fourth quarter stuff Other than Call of Duty But There's not a lot that they can really cram in there Usually there's a Guitar Hero game around that time But I mean, they've got What, the X-Men game They've got the new Spider-Man game They have a Crappy Spyro game that has Some stupid little toy thing that you've got to Scan your toy in order to play the character In the game And then of course they've also got I think they're going to have a big I think they might be blowing a big announcement About Diablo before Before Blizzcon Blizzard's all their own thing They're not going to announce any of that Activision has been the one calling the shots For a little while, which is why some of us Wow advocates think the game's gone A little bit south the past couple of years They may announce a console port Because there's already rumors that they hired people To port over the Playstation 3 I actually think that's exactly what the announcement's going to be But we'll get into that later We'll get into E3 predictions a little later on Woohoo! I'm going to try We're going to go This is definitely live radio here We actually have a man on the ground Already in LA who's also going to be joining us On the Tuesday and Wednesday shows We're actually going to give him a call right now Live, unscripted He's actually at some type of event already And I want to get more details on that I know he's already been by the convention center So we're going to give our old buddy Miklotov a call And see what's up in LA right now This may be botched a little bit He's at some event And I'll get some more details on what's going on It could be very noisy Two ringing dingies Hey Miklotov Hey what's up Hey not much, it's Rob of course You know that because I've been text messaging you Where are you at? You're at an event The E3 parties have already started What's going on? Yeah this is the What is this I'm at? What am I at right now? It's for Major Nelson's Twitter And it's A huge meetup where they're giving away Food and drinks And free bowling And most importantly Passes to the Fresher event tomorrow Wait are you at a bowling alley? Yes No that's not it Major Nelson's doing the bowling alley thing too There you go Well what's going on at the event? Are there any games that you can see? Anything or is it just a bunch of Bros getting together tossing balls around Here at the bowling alley It's just some colored balloons But I actually went into the E3 expo hall today and looked up what they have on board Hold on hold on hold on Put that on Twitter everybody Microsoft unveils colored balloons At E3 It's a brand new thing for the connect colored This is almost as good as Space suits last year They are green and white And I guess that's purple for connect Breaking Orange Lawns Radio exclusive This is an exclusive report I don't know what you're saying but they're about to get more tickets away So I'm going to hang up on you. Goodbye Yep that's just That's exactly what it's going to sound like Tuesday and Wednesday As well is that we'll get the nice professional Radio call from Bobby Blackwolf And then when he decides he's got to hang up to go to a swanky party Then Megalotov is going to call us Yeah I don't know what really happened today But I saw some balloons Go and run that IGN Colored balloons I remember where the space suits were last year Cosmic jumpsuits or something like that Space ponchos I was just talking about that last night Space ponchos With Alan in the car Let's move on and get into how is your gaming week We always like to start off the show when it's not E3 With how is your gaming week But tonight was a little special. Dark Soccer how is your gaming week There was a crap load of rock band Last night. We had rock band 3 And Beatles rock band going on last night And I sang A lot and my throat hurts I haven't lost my voice What did you sing? What are your specialties? Well I don't have The song that apparently everyone says I'm really good at So I was Singing um Chemical romance And uh What else did I do? 9 in the afternoon. Panic at the Disco Which is like one of my favorite songs And um I think I did some Kansas And Any chance we get you to hum a few bars? No And I also did I sang just about everything that we did in Beatles Rock band except for like 3 that Drew Nami Sang He was at the party too There was a blast from the past. Intern Drew. Good job And um I also played Wow Which I did today And yelled at the ship for not arriving on time Or at least on time in my universe Sorry I have to share this. Mikolatov just texted me He's like you can call me back it was too loud To hear the numbers. I'm like I will call when you have something News besides colored balloons Don't judge Um They're green and white No shit It's Xbox And Dan's been playing LA Noire And I've beat Portal 2 now For like the 9th time And I'm on my 10th playthrough On single player mode And I find something new every time It's fun But I finally got the Smash TV Achievement Rob Well all the other ones are easy Except for the last one you have to get Which is the room where It's like you go in And there's uh Glass to your right And then there's 3 turrets And the button you need to press is in front of the turrets On the other side of the glass So you have to go across and send the Little uh Tube to send your blue goo across But you have to throw the goo And knock down 2 of the turrets And then go in the hole That's above the last turret And manage to jump down with enough momentum to where you land just behind the turret Pick it up, carry it over And set it down straight so that it does not fall over And die to where it shoots bullets at Wheatley And then That's how you get the last one That sounds complicated It's super complicated and it took me something like 25 tries to do it because I get motion sick And after try number 15 I wanted to throw up But I kept doing it And I finally got it And then I like saved the game and left the room Hard work pays off The other ones were super easy Alright anything else for your gaming week? Um We had pie Loki how was your gaming week? Orange sickle cupcakes My gaming week was alright I didn't play a whole lot I played portal through a little bit again Cheating all the way this time Which is fun mainly just Kill time I didn't really want to play anything else Um played more Grand Theft Auto as usual And um Let's see Also a tiny little bit of L.A. Noire didn't really get a whole lot of time To play it But I made it through you know like the first Kind of case that you have there Um it's interesting I mean The game is really detailed but uh I don't know I'd probably get into it I just have to have some time to play it That's pretty much it Wow Sounds like uh you had a pretty Quick week for games Yeah well I'm still working on You know Grand Theft Auto mods And a whole bunch Of other garbage Anything that you're kind of looking Forward to with the next week? Any demos That might hit the store that you're like ooh I gotta play that No oh by the way my uh Dev console got banned from Partner net which is kind of disappointing How'd that happen? How'd you get caught? It's just they eventually ban all of them You know after a while But it doesn't matter there wasn't really Anything on partner net that I wanted to play It was all Xbox Live or arcade games There's no like you know betas For you know another Halo or something Like that you're not gonna find anything juicy like that on there Um and It besides all those Games that are on partner net Other people aren't banned and those people Leak out those games for everyone Else with JTAG consoles so Eh whatever I decided To check to see if there's any E3 demos on there but You're getting better about hiding that stuff Eh whatever I I don't really even care Well if it's anything like last year like almost all the trailers That will be at the press conference tomorrow You will see then show up on E3 or I'm sorry on Xbox to download so you know You'll see it in glorious HD I'm not even worried about playing demos For stuff um you know there are Are some games that look really awesome Like you know Saints Row 3 I was pretty excited for From the get go cause I love Saints Row It's just kinda it kept The fun aspect and just the Really over the top part Of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas And they just keep building up on it and You know the first game was sort of a Grand Theft Auto Ripoff but it's really become kind of its own Thing and I love Just the whole game it's just Really fun and the new The new one that they have coming out this fall It just looks amazing I really I can't wait to play it Even if they do announce a new You know Grand Theft Auto game I love both games both series I think can Coexist because they're just kinda Different I am very disappointed though That the third um doesn't have Online multiplayer As far as like death matches and stuff goes Because I mean I don't know The first game was kinda Eh it wasn't very good as far as That they had online and the second game They tried to mix it up a little bit but it was really Wacky the way they had everything they really Shoulda just stuck with you know Kinda doing a Grand Theft Auto style where it's Okay here's a portion of the map that you play In and go you know something Simple like that but uh they tried to Do some funky stuff with it and it was alright But it's the maps that they had are really Kinda limited and you know The fun is kinda limited too but at least they have Online co-op for two players this time Let me go um to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com Uh and I think Breakman's pretty much echoing something you just said here Saints Row 3 doesn't have any multiplayer versus Though frown. Yeah just uh Two player online co-op like the second game Which is fun you know cause I I'm Grand Theft Auto so Co-op can be fun. Yeah co-op is fun and It was actually a lot of fun playing a System Link co-op with uh The second Saints Row game so I'm I'm looking forward to this new one For sure and I mean You know And you know right now I'm still playing lots of Grand Theft Auto but that's gonna Interrupt or something's gonna interrupt that Though come July cause July July 5th to be exact Is when we get The new Earth Defense Force game Oh that's gonna be awesome Counting down the days. Oh yeah Alright let me get to my gaming week um Quite a bit actually this week we'll start with demos You know I usually don't like to review Games based on the demo but when a big big demo Comes out I like to kinda get my first impressions On it uh Dungeon Siege 3 is the demo I downloaded which is available uh I was surprised that they were even gonna make a Dungeon Siege 3 because I kinda thought the first two games You know they they made their point they had their Relevance of course they were PC only titles Uh but now Square Enix Is behind the publishing of this third Game uh that's happening uh now On the consoles uh and I believe PCs later on so the demo's available On Xbox Live. It's all the same time. Huh? Yeah all the same time uh so the Demo's now available on Xbox Live and it's very Diablo-esque if you've never played Dungeon Siege It's very Diablo it was kinda Microsoft's answer to Diablo In some ways uh and so the game's very Diablo-esque and uh it was okay You know I had a good time playing it but um I thought like especially Following up a game like Torchlight Uh it was nice to kinda see the more Robust graphics and that Square Enix Cinema presentation Presentation style excuse me Um was it something I'm excited To spend $60 on? No Not based off the demo but will I like Get it or get it in a bargain bin? Sure absolutely You know it's a very challenging Position we're in right now in the gaming industry With this whole it's gonna be interesting to see What develops with this E3 because you know Some games you are expected to pay $60 For some games like Angry Birds you're expected to pay a dollar for Or even get free and it's really about Trying to find that happy price point and you know We're talking about a new Nintendo console coming out At E3. What are the games gonna cost? Is Nintendo now gonna up the bar to $60? Although some would argue they have Been already Oh yeah I don't doubt but are The games gonna be worth it? I mean there's a certain point Where the consumer goes hmm do I really Buy this at $60 or do I just Wait till it comes down in price or I don't know like it's a tricky NGP games are $50 Wow really But PSP games were $50 Well not a lot of PSP games Were $50 but there were a few But like $40 is kind of you know The price point For the PSP but they did have $50 Games So that's all I really want to say about the demo It was cool Fable 3 I got to play which is a game Like a year and a half old so I bet a lot of you that were Interested in this have probably already played it but I was a little late to the party. I played the game It's neat. There's a lot of concepts In Fable I really like But I sometimes wonder if this game tries to do Too much and at its core It's really repetitive And it's like a Facebook game Repetitive like I like the fact that you do these quests To enhance relationship with villagers And I like this whole way that the Villager enhancement thing is built in but when you're doing The same fetch quest or the same Delivery quest multiple Times you're like okay So what am I doing Here you know and this is I felt like It's just very very repetitive I cannot trust anything Peter Milano Says anymore I mean seriously All of his innovative stuff is Such bullshit because it's just like Look at all this innovative stuff I added a dog To my game no other game has had Dogs in it before this dog You'll love no I didn't give a shit about the Dog yeah the dog was cool but you know what The dog was as cool as any other dog in Any other game the dog was actually Kind of stupid sometimes the biggest Crime for me that Fable 3 made I don't feel it took the series Forward I feel it took it back yeah I think Fable 2 was a much better game And I think it had that whole good And evil thing developed and like Fable 3 I don't even notice it it really doesn't even seem like That exists in it it's more about this whole Path to being a king more politics Which is a very repetitive Grind And I kind of got like I was really into it For about an hour and a half and then I got bored of it I got really bored of it and I was like you know What I'm done I don't really want to play Any more Fable 3 and uh Yeah I feel bad saying it because there's a lot That I like about the Fable Series and I really liked Fable 2 I think Fable 3 was rushed To be honest I think they needed to wait Another year to put this game out there was a lot that was really Glitchy in it too and just I didn't like The map system and good lord the Loading and like Just watching the screen draw Like oh No this did not come out Like you should have Dan got rid of ours Yeah and luckily I just borrowed this one so I'm giving it back So sorry Fable 3 gets a Pass from me but the second one's good Third one's crap Not as good So if they are announcing a new Fable game at E3 Which some think or I guess a Fable Side, wasn't Fable 3 supposed to have Kinect Later on? I'm kind of glad they Didn't to be honest but if they spun it off Into a whole new game I hope it's Interesting No Anyhow Katsune in our chat room says I got really bored with it Quickly as well And the whole I know you all love this term Microtransactions for like outfits And weapons and stuff No that was an obvious Bad that was just Microtransactions gone bad I would never drop a penny on any of it Period. Sorry The other game I played This week I got to watch Alan play the Duke Nukem Forever demo which hit Steam over the weekend and I have to admit I like It's very tongue in cheek It does not make any Pauses about where exactly this Game comes from. Have you seen Loki The opening sequence to Duke Nukem Forever In the demo? Ah yes And I love that it starts in the Whole football scene which is very reminiscent Of the end of the last game which was in the football stadium But then it This is a little bit spoilery but deal with it It's the first five minutes of the game It pans out of the Football field or whatever And you see that Duke is actually Playing the video game And it pans out So far that you see these two girls are actually Giving him a blowjob while he's playing the game They are the Molson twins by the way The Molson twins And they're like oh was that good for you Or wholesome twins or something like that It's basically the olson twins And they said something like Oh was the game good Duke And he goes yeah well after 12 fucking Years it better be So I like that it made No pauses about that but then When Alan got into The actual game all I heard was This is hard this is bullshit This is hard this game is hard This is hard I hate this game this is bullshit So apparently it's really cheap Why doesn't he just play it on an easier setting He is playing it on like easiest Why doesn't he just get better At games then Tell him he needs to go back and play Duke Nukem 3D I wish I could go back and play Duke Nukem 3D I can't really Accurately judge Duke Nukem forever Until I play multiplayer Because that's where everything Duke Nukem I mean fuck single player in that game Seriously it was not I mean after level 1 1 where you have the stripper And everything like that it's forgettable I actually really did like the single player The single player levels were pretty awesome I even like the atomic edition With all the extra stuff that they added in there Like I love the level that was basically Disneyland which is pretty awesome I love the one that was in a supermarket They had one at like a post office and stuff like that It was just those were kind of cool to me I kind of feel like I should just go back and play Duke Nukem 3D Yeah but see though We tried that though on Remember the 360 we all downloaded and got all excited And it kind of sucked Salacious Pop is yelling at me in the chat room Lies and slander lies and slander Lies and slander That's what it sounded like to me my bad I'm sleeping on the couch tonight Alright um Is he on Skype? I could call him to defend himself Do it Hold on I'll look up his number Isn't that sad I don't even know his number Because we live in such a cell phone age That I don't need it I'm just going to call him and see what happens I know my husband's number Do do do do do do do do do do This is just the night of random outbound phone calls Is what it is Let's call my mother next We should have sent my mother to E3 wouldn't that have been fun Yeah Should be able to get in Pick up the phone gonna be all what's this number instead of the voicemail he's screaming no in the chat room he's not answering I went to voicemail all right live radio he's like my phone is in the other room oh he's running to fire out I'll try one more time one more time everybody in the chat room is yelling at him this is the best radio ever this is even funnier than sure me saying bless you in some apparently he was playing it on medium and I misunderstood that hello okay lies and slander I need to turn the radio down or else we're gonna have really bad gecko okay we're fine sure okay hi hi hi tonight's the night of random phone calls where I call people chatters you'll notice what so so then you tell me about the Duke Nukem demo since I clearly misunderstood once you get to the second part of the demo where you it shows you some vehicle play which is fun and then you get out of your truck and the background is brown and the enemies are brown so when they pop out I actually had a hard time seeing them and because I was playing it on me and difficulty by the time I could get behind cover I was dead already so I switched it too easy and then learned where the spawns were and then switched back to medium and I was fine but yeah it's it's I think there's some work that needs to be done on the clarity of the the mobs especially since they don't they all kind of jump out from behind things from out of nowhere so the game's gone gold now so whoops I don't know if they're gonna fix that yeah I know right so yeah I didn't it feels like Duke they definitely captured the humor and the attitude but as far as some amazing first-person shooter like Bioshock which was a completely different experience there's I don't think there's anything that remarkable about it it's pretty much all fan service the fact that it exists it means that it's going to sell but I don't think it's all that you know super amazing from the demo so do you think you'll invest 50 bucks or whatever in the full version on Steam hell no I don't care I don't care that badly that it's really kind of offensive and I mean obviously it's a dude bro game with the you know blowjob in the opening scene but I you know does the demo have multiplayer I don't think so hmm that's too bad all right all right well thanks for letting me bug you don't be mad okay but I want you I wanted you to be able to accurately represent and defend yourself I would never want to get your opinions yes all right okay who should we call next let's see okay no no we got a versus a show to do okay we got to get into news that's it for our gaming weeks quick housekeeping again I just want to clarify the schedule there will be no OLR next Sunday there will be two episodes at well are on the feed this week Tuesday night Wednesday night join us on our new you stream channel seven o'clock Pacific with special correspondent Bobby black wolf here's the great news I don't think this really affects anyone listening to this show but he's also gonna be posting the shows on his feed which I think is really cool so that way if you I don't know why you would be listening right now and you're not subscribed to our show but okay let's say you're not you can also get them from Bobby's feed so they're gonna be in both places for a maximum exposure I'm getting tweeted pictures by the way right now from miklotov who I guess went to the convention center earlier and I guess you know a couple days before the show you can just kind of walk right on in there and walk around he's not in the actual exhibition halls but let's see there's a giant ad for is Assassin's Creed revelations giant ad for that a little picture of the lobby that shows nothing really notable can't really see in the room there and they won't let him up the stairs I'm sure and then it looks like what they're advertising on the entryway is rage which is supposed to that big new shooter right which is gonna have a whole new engine that people are going to adapt kind of like what unreal brought to the table and there's these little gross little aliens crawling all over the entry plaza for rage so you can expect that that game is going to have a big presence and three so there you go I know our next Sunday because dark soccer and I will be at Disneyland with Bobby actually won't be there Sunday but we'll be driving back so and there will be a damn there will be a damn there will be a damn Dan will be here for the Tuesday Wednesday shows to us because Loki unfortunately will only be able to join what I can do he might try to pull some strings and join us live that would be amazing we'll see what happens when may you can call me you know I can do it over Skype or something like that all right for at least like from eight o'clock on but we need at least the Nintendo press conference feedback that's all that's yeah I agree Wednesday maybe you know maybe not Wednesday but like Tuesday would be fun because then that'd be after all the press conferences there you go all right anyhow let's move on with gaming news because we got a lot to cover tonight it's not just e3 but of course course e3 rumors are going to start it come on so everybody's talking about let's start us off Loki yes and I don't know I I think it's a dumb name but whatever there's a rumor that the what's being you know codenamed NGP right now is actually going to be officially revealed as the PlayStation Vita or the PS Vita or vita vita could be either way pens if they're going for vital or vitamin or vita pita yes and so well here's here's what evidence they have for that one there was a leaked or apparently leaked picture of a brochure showing the system with the PS Vita image on there and you know where is most people might say oh that may be photoshopped well there's least some other evidence to go along with that there's actually a few a few pictures of that so that's kind of interesting also there's apparently there was like a domain for developers that actually had a PS Vita for it's the Sony dev site they had that and then also there apparently there's text for the PlayStation Vita hidden away in the code for the e3 site for Sony so yeah I gotta say that that's probably true you know if it's if it's hidden away in their code on their website and it's also on their dev site and it's also in this brochure it's probably makes me feel great about the security of Sony in the future by the way um I also agree it's it's probably the right name it makes sense I it's you know they're trying to go for that catchy thing I also just the fact that do you guys remember last e3 everything got spoiled every no or was it two years ago yes well by them member with the end with the PSP go no not just that there was one year were like every big announcement that they were going to make was spoiled and I remember he got up on stage when he showed the trailer for Final Fantasy 14 it was been two years ago he got up on stage to show the trailer for fantasy 14 everybody thought he was he had fucked up and meant to say 13 to but no it was actually 14 and then he goes hey there's one we kept from you like I remember that vividly in my mind like the rest of that press conference and spoiled yeah I'm glad you kept that one from us wish you'd kept it away from us forever you keep it a little bit longer I'm some other cool information regarding the NGP or Vita I guess we'll call the Vita it's going to be fully backwards compatible with all PSP games that are on the PlayStation Network obviously it's not gonna have a UMD drive it will also offer a smoothing and dual analog support so for example you know games like resistance retribution you know how they had the DualShock 3 controller support if you you played that with PlayStation or the PSP Go or believe through your through the resistance like for the call that like the infected mode or something like that it's basically where it linked up with resistance to be playing through that you could also do DualShock 3 support but now it's going to support for all games because you know obviously the new piece of hardware has tool you know dual analog sticks that's kind of cool I'm sorry I I'm late to the party and that's fine I'm actually waiting to hear a lot of this from Sony's mouth tomorrow but on this thing doesn't have a UMD drive it doesn't have any that doesn't have any dry has it has to physical like SD card proprietary some sort of storage card ok ok so there's some I was like they didn't learn from the go that people don't want to download no it's like a cartridge ok but yeah the rule is that there is no onboard storage at all for this thing you have to buy your own like memory cards or something like that but that each game would have its own you know card and there be space on there for download content with a tiger kalana term says they should have called it PS vivo which is Spanish for live might be ok name I think I think it's just going to be PSV is what's going to end up I think yeah PSV and I think it's vita for this is vital in for you to have because it has everything you know and that's that Sony's little tagline it only does everything and that's what you know and to be fair it was the strength of the PSP is it online you've a clip it is just like you know my own trees yeah I I would believe vita it's gonna and I think it's vital this is a vital it's vital for all gamers to have this I'm sticking with for clint that's how anyone who buys will handle and apparently you know the they've been on the record saying that they're gonna learn they've learned from the mistakes with the PSP and they're going to make sure they don't make them again with the the vita they're basically saying we wanted to our biggest mistake I would say with the PSP was that we were just so happy to provide the ps2 gaming on the go we kind of stop there is what we want to do with the NGP or fighter besides the great graphics and CPU think on what the interface could put in to make gameplay reality stand out I really stand out you know something that you cannot even do on the ps3 and yeah that makes sense with the rear touch pin the augmented reality stuff and touchscreen also but I think it's almost like too much you know like they have like some games that are kind of showing off that we're touching I don't know it's a little weird to me but we'll see and I gotta be honest you know I was kind of you know I'm one to kind of buy every console when it comes out and stuff but you know I'm probably actually not gonna buy one of these and the reason why is they were shown off some of the games that they have at launch or whatever they have a wipeout game and they have course ridge racer they have uncharted no ridge racer and some others and some other games like super stardust and stuff like that but I'm not a fan of uncharted I don't really care about wipeout so it's to me it's almost like hey look it's the 3ds lineup again no I'm not gonna do this you're not a fan of uncharted bless from her alright I wouldn't look at the chat room here with some of the comments about the name JV Mon in our charm says Vita equals life PlayStation life like you live a PlayStation life actually isn't PlayStation life the name of one of the channels like it's the one that no one ever uses that had the well they used it at first it has the news and the folding at home is that PlayStation life don't they call it that I don't know also salacious pop in our charm says living la vida joca we knew that joke was coming we knew that joke was coming moving on more rumors more things to talk about this time about Microsoft and some of the things that apparently they have coming and this news has to do with trademarks and other things that have been spotted out in the wild let's see fusion genesis is one of the trademarks that is shown up for Microsoft and also fusion vault infusion sentiment they are specified in the little trademark as entertainment services namely providing an online computer game so there must be some type of fusion series coming out for either xbox live arcade gotta be fusion frenzy I fucking hate no fusion frenzy that was a Hudson thing anyway was never Microsoft centric and you know they couldn't swap developers on you know Microsoft game okay but like if Microsoft was gonna buy a franchise like fusion frenzy which I don't think I mean I realize Hudson in the US kind of close but I believe they still have a Japanese presence so well just because why would you buy the fusion frenzy series that last game was awful and on top of that you know it's like Hudson was responsible for the Mario Party games and those weren't terrible it's just like for the 360 like or even the original xbox let's just not give a shit on this problem with all due respect to people that work at Hudson the biggest issue with Hudson is that they've had some really big hits and some huge misses like just wow wow like bomber man zero was a Hudson game if I'm not mistaken correct yeah yeah fusion frenzy too I think all bomber man games have been Hudson because Hudson created bomber man correct but the arc now see but when they hit they hit pretty well deca sports actually wasn't a bad game it was pretty nice little expansion of Wii Sports I the bomber man xbox live arcade thing was great for you know it was delivered exactly what people wanted out of a bomber man game but anyway how did we get from fusion to bomber man oh yeah that's because it's a fusion frenzy yeah you know the problem with Hudson is their own by Tommy I wonder if it's not their answer to pixel junk that's where my mind goes like it doesn't necessarily have to be like they're gonna go why do they need to even answer that I mean seriously because it's done well for so what so good a game is done well for Sony why they need to answer that they have plenty of good games on xbox live arcade hell there's good games coming out every week on xbox live arcade versus the PlayStation Network which doesn't get everything you know each week game guru in our chat says I think Microsoft owns the fusion frenzy license ok fine but really I really don't think these games have any idea of fusion crazy that last game killed the series let it let it die you know just I don't think this is it I mean I I don't know they could be a connect thing with me I think it's just gonna be minigame garbage unfortunately that's where my mind goes but it's just a freaking name it could also be the best game we've ever seen I mean we just don't know their names I'm gonna make the best game ever and call freaking garbage and you play a garbage man that's what well no ok case in point super meat boy hat I based on the name and the box art I was like this game looks stupid this game looks so stupid and then I played it I'm like oh my god schemes amazing so you know names do not mean everything anyway let's get to some other speaking of names some other registrations domains apparently some internet domain names that have been registered fabled the journey new fable game or possible Xbox Live or possibly fable connect fable connect this is what Milo turned into I'm thinking it's this all that whole like you can have him set down in the stream and you can hold the pieces of paper interacting with people fable the journey is what happened to Milo I know I don't even think it's that far I think it's just fable with some connect you know connectivity I guess I've abandoned no I've abandoned the whole fable series anyway so the hell with I don't even care what it is alright connect fun labs is another one that was already leaked though in an earlier thing I dance central to which I mean really duh really connect sports season two duh yeah also also pretty much a duh so the sequels to our two most successful connect titles never exactly again it's it's really all about okay what is the connect gonna give us that isn't part of the we I'm really interested in what this whole connect Star Wars thing is that because remember they if they had teased that last year and we got nothing well this is the year we need to see what connects Star Wars is all about all LucasArts got you know they have right now is just the Old Republic that's it they have nothing else slated to come out that they have announced all right go going to our chairman chat dot orange launch radio comm Randy and our charm says hold hands and fable with connect what the hell was that hand-holding thing anyway like it didn't make sense like just say follow me for well for escorting the girl and stuff it made sense but did you really have to be able to hold hands and run everybody through town it's just weird I go did it but I go she was I go all right moving on what did the press conference has already happened right dark soccer konami we had some announcements from konami we had the Metal Gear Solid HD collection that has Metal Gear Solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 snake eater and Metal Gear Solid peace Walker but the original one is not in it Twin Snakes though I mean that was that should have been in there they've already remade it once so but anyway it's going to be available on the ps3 and Xbox and will support 1080p and on the ps3 there is a transferring feature well I guess transferring I should say it must have been misspelled no I think they are misspelling it on purpose they're little trans firing yeah yeah where you can transfer your peace Walker game from your PSP to your ps3 I know like how they pronounce million Marion you can trance you can transfer your game from the ps3 to the PSP there's also a zone of the enders HD collection so that has one of the enders and some of the enders too and not much else is said about that except that they're thinking it'll be out in 2012 and it'll be a ps3 and Xbox 360 and it will also have trans firing much better but there wasn't a zone of the enders game on the PSP I well more importantly than all of that there's going to be a Silent Hill collection which is silent hill two and three and it's just basically touched up to look good in HD and doesn't say what's going to be on although my assumption would be well ps3 and Xbox 360 no maybe you can transfer to there too I don't know I'm gonna call it trans fart so that I can think of pooting noises whenever you do your trans farting well here's the thing the trans firing stuff the psycho mantis read my trans farted data it's not really a good feature anyways because the only game you can use that for would be the PSP port and peace Walker is the only game and I'm assuming you have to have the original game for that as well so I don't know that's kind of weird it does feel like a lot of wasted resources on something no one's going to use correct yeah and what I would think would be cool is that for those of us who have older ps3s it would be cool if there you know could be some way to transfer your save file but other than that you know that would be a pipe dream yeah I don't know did you guys watch Konami's press conference out of curiosity no here's the thing I I did watch most of it and what I thought was interesting most people were looking forward to Konami's press conference this year because the last couple years have just been an absolute fucking train wreck like it has just been like Konami it's just like like you know and I've used this reference before on the show but it's so true it's like the old episodes of the Ricky Lake show where she's just got her hand against her like uh and her jaw drop like I can't even control what's going on this stage right now is the show a hot mess yeah there was the year that they showed rock revolution and they failed the song on stage and then they had what last year the whole lucha libre thing wasn't that part of their thing and like it was just like what in the hell is going on in the hole what was it the one Marion troops and I I oh my god it was just it was just like what fucking train wreck thing is gonna happen now like it's Oprah's gonna come out and do bees everybody we got a game about bees hopefully you've all seen that gift from the Conan show this is the best thing ever made anyway um somebody in chat quick find me the Oprah bees gift because everybody needs to see it because that's what we were expecting at the Konami press conference this year was bees but no the whole thing was pre-recorded and it was a pre-recorded slickly produced video reel it was very reminiscent of for those that have seen the Konami booth at e3 they always have a giant television elite well last year they remodeled it I can't remember if they have the giant TV anymore but at least for the last few years before that they had a giant television that would cycle through all the trailers and people kind of sit and watch it was very reminiscent of this is the video that's gonna play on the giant TV all e3 which is which I found it you know what hey it was a interesting way for them to do it and you know they got their message out there and didn't really get made fun of and there's been a lot of hypes for the products I found it very interesting that they did it that way in part probably so that it was very scripted and would not fall apart alright here's my complaint and besides what Jamie's gonna talk about here in a second really is this all you've got you've got remakes of your old shit I is that it this is what you've worked hard on is well is taking assets from an old game and sprucing up sprucing up and hey you know you're not really playing a new game we're just taking the old game hold on hold on it up a bit and pumping it back into your console Kojima did come out to talk about a new about his new engine for a game they has no game for you know well here's the thing this is tricky though because maybe it's a game they're going to announce but did because of this whole pre three thing they didn't please just like you know they would announce it anyways if they were going to have something to announce because I mean seriously where's a you know no you're rising oh they mentioned that it's still coming to you next year even though they mentioned it two years ago last year I guess yay thank you to the four chatters that all found that at once for me the Oprah bees gift have you seen it Loki I'm afraid I have not seen my favorite fucking thing ever wait hold on oh there's a YouTube Ziba bless your heart ultimate Oprah's ultimate favorite things here we go nope I made a full screen here we go this is for you too they're opening the box and bees and they're playing them I'm a bee in the background and this is what we were expecting Konami's press conference this year was great I love having a live chat room more than anything because they can find shit like that for us on a whim and I don't care if it's a radio show and you can't see the video this is about my amusement and Oprah bees amuses me I have more Silent Hill me all right what well there was another announcement for a new Silent Hill title and it's called book of memories and it's gonna be for the vitamin the ps vitamin which is what I'm gonna call it the vitamin and they say that is going to be exclusive to the vitamin and it will be released quote later down the road after Silent Hill collection later down the road didn't even say what fuck if we know it's coming someday so you didn't even mention Silent Hill downpour at all they talked a little bit about dance dance revolution hey we got an arcade machine that's coming to Japan oh good oh you wanted something for you guys oh sorry we don't have anything for you we're telling you this because we know you'll import it anyway we don't even have Glee for you which is fine you know we don't care revolution Glee but I mean did they announce some of that stuff kind of just in written form only like a new DDR game is coming out to like it wasn't really in the video but they did put out a little paper on it well you know I didn't see a DDR game on there I didn't all I saw was you know x3 the arcade machine and that's it and yeah it's coming out in Japan so that that does not count I'm afraid I'm sorry so really what they're spending their time on doing is taking old shit and making it new again or not even making a new making it prettier great good job you know who can get away with that Sony can get away that cuz you know why cuz they put out new shit on top of that I again you said they put out I think you I I think it's too early to really say that because next week you know we have a new Nintendo console coming out you know Konami is working on something as oh I'm shaking waiting for the new elephants game it's gonna come out maybe it's okay and maybe another deck of sports game because you know there'll be another deck of sports game I'm done with you it's like deca sports and Ella bits maybe and what other crap did they put out whenever there's a new console hmm let me think here they don't put out Ella bits every time there's a new console that happened once on the Wii yeah but they're gonna totally bring it over you know it I don't think they will yeah that's right you just made sure me leave the room that's guys believe that's another Hudson title too anyway she's probably gonna go take a shit in the hall because of your outburst I'm just thank you for making my cat poop all right can we move on with another story please I guess I'm just saying it's it was not disappointing because I kind of expect this little out of them you know I was hoping they would surprise me but they might still know they're not come on this is Konami we're talking about here they are never gonna surprise us they're gonna just come out like almost want to bet money on this I'm doing the pie almost want to bet money on this but I'm not going to because I'm broke and I'm going to Disneyland this week and I need my money fine well just let's talk about something else all right there's a rumor that Microsoft's gonna be announcing a TV service at e3 basically kind of this whole rumor you know IP TV thing well now they're gonna kind of take it a step further and basically become their own you know service so instead of having you know dish or something like that you could have you know whatever we're gonna call this believe Xbox Live diamond they're saying is what's gonna be which is funny because I remember back in the day having the diamond card which gave me nothing but didn't it give you like discounts at Quiznos for like a month of something like that you know like I never used I never upgrade of a section sub to a footlong that was what PS diamonds those little like you know fundraising cards entertainment books not even that not even the entertainment book but you know it's a little like fundraising cards that you get that it's like oh this is for all the local businesses you know 10% off of a you know a Subway sandwich or four square well no not four square predating all of that I know I know it's hard to think of a time that I wore square didn't exist all I can think of is the entertainment books honestly there was the thing they'd sell them for like 35 bucks and all it was like buy one get one free yeah those are sold those and banned it's like I'm never gonna use all this I don't know um so before there was Groupon there was entertainment books uh yes so they're saying that it's gonna be for an additional monthly fee it's basically gonna be like a virtual cable operator and yeah so not really too much that we know or if it's even gonna be announced it would be kind of neat because honestly you know cables fucking expensive so if I can get something decent for you know cheaper okay but correct me if I wrong if net neutrality this whole thing about that the websites will soon be able to block whatever the I'm sorry internet providers will soon be able to be able to block whatever they want goes through um do you think Comcast is gonna have this they'll just be like a block unless Microsoft is somehow bought in to the providers and they kind of have done this with ESPN like when you connect to the ESPN it shows in the corner when I connect it says brought to you by Comcast like it knows what you're connecting to them through it's possible so either there's gonna be an agreement or this little TV network that they're doing might be their own set of channels like it's not gonna be tied to regular TV I mean do you remember about a year ago it had come out that before Conan signed the deal with TBS he had entertained the notion about doing a weekly show or a nightly show on Xbox Live have been awesome and that's why I think there's a lot of truth to this because I think Microsoft's been trying to build this for some time and they they have a similar service in UK although granted it's not their own channel so I don't know I don't know where it's gonna fall I think I think there absolutely will will be at least one new Microsoft channel in this and of course MSNBC this is what does MS stand for in MSNBC so at least those two channels but yeah I mean I don't if you get your cable internet through a cable provider your cable providers gonna be pissed that this whole thing is going on they'll try to stop it yeah and maybe even through nefarious purposes it'll be it'll be about bandwidth caps and all that garbage so we'll see anyhow other news about other things going on at e3 Q games is going to be showing three titles at e3 please note that they are this is not the same thing as Q entertainment I had actually made that mistake a little earlier on I thought this is about Q entertainment no Q games is the company that makes like pixel junk shooter and pixel they make all those games they are apparently they have like a preview online for one other pixel junk game and it was a little bit weird that title it was a pixel junk lifelike they had done a little preview of that apparently they are going to do two unannounced projects at e3 could they be more pixel junk games seems to be a lot of what they do now I bet one of them will be but one of them might be something a little new maybe for another console or something like that IDK but not the same as Q entertainment who makes luminous and and you know it's a rez and all that child of eden mizuguchi studio yeah different so there you go well we would move on to another story of dark soccer left the studio so let me just yell at Loki some more what are you yelling about how right I am but I was getting some dinner okay it's Dan made pasta Alfredo anyway well how about some sim stuff although this is not the cool type of sims news I wanted this actually makes me kind of sad but I'll go ahead and tell everybody there's going to be a new standalone game on Xbox 360 ps3 and the 3ds that is sims 3 pets and they said that it's going to be a standard expansion on the PC and Mac but I don't know if it's gonna be as awesome as what I'm hoping basically you can control your pets and you can breed them and share them the Xbox 360 version will have Kinect capabilities you can control the sims and their pets with voice commands and then he's like make out and then they'll make out that type of thing but pets will for the 3ds will have a pedometer so you get more karma points the more that you walk and you can use it to buy in-game items and then with the street pass you can get pets to other pets owners so there you go I'm just hoping that it I would rather that for the PC one that it works a lot more like the old pets expansion did know you have you can build your dog house and you can have your cat and you have to clean up your cat's poo and that type of thing I'd make a big fat shirmy sounds like fun well sims is for people who don't want to pay second life but you know it's a lot more fun I don't know maybe they want to play second life by themselves but like now I have to get generations if I want to play this one it's RPM it's roleplay masturbation it's self-serving I'm kidding me the odds of the Sims is what the still the best-selling PC game ever right pretty much I don't even think Wow beat it so there you go all right let's travel the world and look at some release dates if you don't want to get the Sims maybe there's something else coming out to a store near you very soon this week there's actually quite a few things coming out it's just kind of nice well certain things off infamous two on the PlayStation 3 that's gonna be coming out this week red faction Armageddon coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC let's see also this week operation flashpoint Red River that's gonna be coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC as well see here I really wish these lists would load up faster pretty much the big releases this week the rest is just crap leave it at that well you got these games in a bunch of crap that's what's coming out this yeah I mean I think they have like a fucking triple pack for Ben 10 or some garbage like that if you know that's your thing then cool what other garbage do they have here Duke Nukem critical mass but that's not actually coming out at that time Oh Green Lantern of course there's a movie tie-in game for that which I'm sure it'll be just wonderful that's on PlayStation 3 we and Xbox 360 oh and DS and 3ds because that's a good 3ds title right there oh yeah and then I forgot because this is actually about a week from today we play motion will be coming out for Nintendo this is the innovative content they have oh hey we play sold really well let's make another one of those so that'll be coming out from Nintendo with a black Wii U remote plus awesome that's it all right moving on to Japanese release dates what's coming out over there on the Xbox 360 on June 9th the Gears of War twin pack it's a platinum collection now so a little bit of a price reduction for those of you guys in Japan also Phantom Breaker in a limited edition red faction Armageddon and riot act 2 goes into the platinum collection so that is also getting a price reduction riot act 2 is crackdown what's their version of crackdown moving on to other consoles such as the PlayStation 3 red faction Armageddon there as well real got to cool comes out of the end is what that's called that is coming out on the ninth from Sega this is a Yakuza zombie game yeah that looks pretty cool could be interesting are they bringing that over here I don't know it's not been announced yet so Yakuza zombies maybe that's something you'll see any three next week localized version of that on the Nintendo Wii nothing on the 3ds though fish on comes out this week you guessed it it's a fishing game and it's 3d yay I would have never guess it's a fishing game and lastly on the Sony PSP really not a lot this week there's another even galleon limited edition thing it's a patchy game trashy so I'm thinking that is what another Pachinko Evangelion game looking at the screenshots another yeah it's like a little slot machine little gambling games little mini games gambling slots that because there's a revamped Evangelion series out so of course it's been getting big side product reboot so there you go that's it does it for your Japanese releases in the UK we have a few things we have on the 7th Super Street Fighter 4 arcade edition and it will be out in the arcade Xbox 360 and ps3 on the 8th we have Beyond Good and Evil HD and then on the 10th we have Arcana Hearts 3 infamous 2 Red Faction Armageddon White Knight Chronicles 2 and Duke Nukem forever that's it forever and ever and stuff and ever did Loki just break in the song I think you did a little bit I said never this is suddenly playing out like an episode of Glee all right Loki so I almost made me gag on my food Rob thank you tell me Loki what's going on what's going on what's going on as we have rumors about the Wii successor this is stuff that we've all kind of heard about before this is coming from Nikkei and this is basically the same publication that also predicted the DSI to DSI excel the 3ds now they're predicting stuff for the new Wii console or new Nintendo console apparently they are saying that it's coming out on the let the second half of 2012 obviously fourth quarter makes sense and that it will also have you the six inch touchscreen on the controller yeah they are basically repeating what everybody else has been saying and also apparently there is supposed to be having some sort of camera on the actual controller as well they're saying that the company omnivision who's working with Apple on its iPhone I'm supplying them with cameras is also apparently supplying a Nintendo with cameras as well so interesting that they're gonna do that and there was one other rumor that didn't make our show roll because it was very very very last-minute but the rumor is that Nintendo's next console might be called Nintendo that's right that's how much effort they're putting into their console they don't even want to fucking name it I you know what I actually don't think it's that terrible the name I think there was a rumor that the Wii was gonna be called that that it's just the Nintendo that whole reboot idea I I actually don't think it's a terrible idea because you know if you go back to when all we had was the Nintendo it was like hey you want to come over to my house and play Nintendo it was just it became like a verb you know what I mean like Xeroxing Kleenex one of those types of things so calling it the Nintendo Nintendo I don't think it's a terrible name I could see like Nintendo HD or something like that I think most people's reaction will be oh okay but I don't think you can say that's a bad name if to be fair the original Nintendo was really called the Nintendo Entertainment System yeah so if they're calling this just the Nintendo it is a new name but I don't I actually don't believe it I I think because to call the system your company when you're trying to also launch a 3ds thing side-by-side I actually don't buy it I would I would give more credit to like Nintendo HD or Nintendo with a very small suffix to it mm-hmm so let's see Randy in our term says not Nintendo the Nintendo Rama says the next console called Nintendo I fucking called that two weeks ago dude you gotta wait till Tuesday for you get to parade that salacious pop to play Nintendo is still relevant vernacular in my opinion so if they want to make a play on that it's not that surprising that's kind of where I'm at my mom still calls it all Nintendo when I showed her Mortal Kombat she was like oh you're gonna fire up the Nintendo okay maybe not like that but you know she saw the same to her so we'll see anyhow one of the story I want to get to you before we get to the classic game of the week and this is important this has to do with of course fundraising efforts that are still going on for Japanese tsunami relief guys it doesn't fix itself overnight this fundraising effort is going to go on for years and years you know again not to bring up really bad memories of the past but when hurricane Katrina happened that took years to clean up and some would argue there's still cleanup efforts that go on to this day so you know Japan is still in need of help for tsunami relief and I think this is a great I love this gamers doing good stuff stories play for Japan is going to be an album that is going to be coming out we've talked about it a few times on the show before the track list was announced this week that's the new news just going over some of the cool things that are going to be on here there's original songs here a kiriyama oka has a song called X on emo let's see Koji Kondo has a Super Mario medley on two piano pianos meets uso Suzuki play for you Tommy Tallarico greater lights so it's not just folks in Japan but it's Western composers as well it's it's gonna be a great lineup so watch the the thing that a kiriyama mocha was talking I did not watch the video I do have it here but did you watch it yes it is what you think really good I mean what was in it just talking about you know working with people from all over the world that worked in the the industry specifically related to music and getting some of the best things out there and that everything was going towards Japan relief I mean it was it was really just thanking people involved and thinking people to buy it and saying hey for all of you following us we recognize we have a rolled a world audience and that type of thing awesome oh also how could I forget no boo-wee Matsu has a new song every new morning you know no boo-wee Matsu anyhow 100% of the proceeds from the play for Japan the album will go straight to the Japanese Red Cross more information available play for Japan org but I think this is great too it will be released in early June on the iTunes store so I mean you know argue if you will if you hate Apple or whatever but it is a huge store gonna be very easy and what I like about it is that I remember a time three years ago it was very hard to find video game music on iTunes now it seems like it's really broken through and it's pretty easy to find a lot of the newer soundtracks on there so uh props to iTunes who hopefully will be featuring that so that'll be available for sale again a hundred percent of the proceeds going to the Japanese Red Cross play for Japan org let's get into the classic game of the week every week here on the show we'd like to highlight a game from gaming's past dark soccer likes to jump into the vault and say hey look while you're talking about your newfangled Nintendo's of the present I remember Nintendo's back in my day back when we played awesome games such as this one yes bionic commando for the NES and I could have gone over bionic commando the arcade version but I didn't because it's not as great in Japan it was known as Hitler no Fuka Fukatsu top secret which means the resurrection of Hitler top secret and it's kind of based off of the 87 bionic commando this one came out in 88 you basically have to explore different stages and you play as lad Spencer who is going to rescue the guy from the first game who was called Super Joe who was captured by the Empire you've got to go stop the Empire of the the the general of the Imperial forces and who is completing the project himself so you have to go and rescue Super Joe and lead the FF battalion or double force battalion who were all commandos who use wired guns rescue him so you've got a stage select map and you move around the map screen and you can choose to move to different areas but you have to go back and go through these overhead areas to get to different places there's 19 areas in the game 1 through 12 or combat and 13 and 19 are all neutral areas where you can't fight at all the if you fire your weapon at all in those areas you'll be attacked by key peacekeeping force and but these are places where that you can get information and items there's also green enemy trucks on the map selection that will try to block your helicopter and if you fly into one of these while you're traveling you have to battle the troops and this is the overhead part oh it's like you know it's kind of like commando so you can actually kill certain enemies to get additional continues so you've got a bionic arm so you can't jump you just use the arm and you latch on and can swing yourself at 45 degrees or you can go up or exactly right so you've got different ways that you can move but it's really just those three ways you can also use the arm to deflect some bullets and grab different enemies and items and then you also get to communicate with your forces to get information and you can tap into the enemy communication although sometimes they will send a squadron to attack you if they detect you and sometimes you get bullets from killing people because whenever I shoot somebody I get bullets so at any rate there were clearly changes that were made to the game as you can probably tell from the Japanese title the whole thing was basically about fighting Nazis the Empire was like a neo-nazi nation and they used a swastika for their logo so of course when it came out over here they changed the logo and everything and they changed you know things to the Imperial forces and blah blah although the end boss still looks like Hitler but they call him master D like hi we kind of know who that is except you do get to see his head explode which is pretty cool because he was a fuckhead yeah and I got to say Tiger Claw in the charm says this is this game is from an era before the ESRB so they were able to get away with some gore on an NES game that was just because the ESRB that was Nintendo's own policy to get rid of the gore but yeah heads exploding you didn't see that in many games no and it was a gory ass explosion I mean it was like everywhere so yeah there have been other remakes there was a portable version of bionic commando on the Gameboy in 1992 that was based off of the NES game but it was turned into a futuristic one because this was actually set in the 80s when it was made in the 80s and then there was of course bionic commando rearmed that was developed by grin and it came out in night in 2008 for PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and the sequel that came out February 2011 and then the original NES bionic commando was featured on a game boy advanced compilation is club Capcom classics mini mix which also included Strider and mighty final fight two really good games well maybe not in a strider but still so uh there's also a book a novel ization that was based off of an S version so the main characters called Jack Marx and he lost his arm when ninjas attacked his hotel room and kidnapped Super Joe so they replaced it sounds like a Michael Bay movie no they replaced it with a bionic limb with a grappling hook and other neato things so there's different things you know the book was super toned down and they didn't kill anybody although certain things like some of the deaths of Hal and kilt are kept in and they just sort of skim over most of the stuff that goes on so they can fit the book and there's an illustrated bionic commando story actually on a website that I will be linking in the chat room and if you're not in a chat room oh well too bad so here you can find out about Super Joe and about spencer alright there it is your classic game of the week bionic commando for the NES not to be confused with the arcade version or a Ziba keeps asking about in the chat room the Commodore 64 version which I don't even remember playing but I'm pretty sure it was based off the arcade more than was the NES speaking of which you did see the magazine that I linked you right retro gamer oh yeah is doing a Commodore 64 special oh it's hot that's hot as well as the anniversary of Street Fighter we need more Commodore 64 games in our classic game of the week well guess who didn't play no I know I every week that you're not here I end up doing something for comfort she picked the week

we kind of have a bridge episode because there's not going to be one next week but it was a good episode tonight I mean they're all good right but it was a good discussion and I especially consider we had a lot of it done last minute some good old Warcraft talk so if you're into Wow at all or you're just Wow curious come on by to horde house calm okay let's move on with some rapid-fire news and there's a lot this week and then of course your tweets so you better get those in because we're almost done twitter.com slash olr by the way speaking of Twitter I want to get a plug out for this because Bobby is helping us with those e3 wrap-up shows he's gonna be telling us he's gonna be helping us get interviews he's gonna be I mean they're like mostly his shows probably think about it but no we'll be here given our smart ass commentary but I do want to say about Bobby speaking of Twitter if you're not following Bobby on Twitter you should be because he's kind of doing he's he's biting an idea we did a couple years ago but with permission we told me good that is you drive him on the show floor he is very minimal appointments so if you're like Bobby I heard this game might be on the show floor and nobody's covering it he'll go find out for you so all that stuff that used to be in Kensha Hall that's now kind of sprinkled throughout the East Halls and West Halls he'll go find that stuff for you I need to know what not to miss putting out so there right now there's the first moon game but there's seriously Twin Cities or Twin Town yes we we demand that Bobby goes to Natsume's booth finds the largest chibi thing that they have on display in the booth and get a picture with it it's harvest moon come on it's always harvest moon no one year they had the the tulip game they were showing the game was great and it always come out you run up and kiss people it did come out as a GameStop exclusive but um I want I don't want a cow I want cow swag from the harvest moon people I have like a pig from them I have a sheep somewhere have their pig but I want a handsome I don't want a pig it's not kosher should I get on to rapid fire news yes please sir okay resistance tool pack is coming out July 5th it is basically resistance one and two for one low price plus you get a few extra skins and why not you get a multiplayer skin that's the Capelli skin and also you're also getting some maps as well the aftermath map pack in skin bundle with the race skin multiplayer skin for resistance to offer 40 bucks you know I actually may pick this up because I sold back resistance one a while ago and I never really finished resistance to before I sold back and I'm really looking forward to number three so I have to pick it up again pretty cool so also this is kind of interesting because usually you hear about these type of things when people are doing their own kind of portable console mods but they're actually selling portable Dreamcast now these are not necessarily I think official you know Dreamcast items actually sanctioned by Sega or something but it's actually a portable system it's gonna go for 38,000 yen or you're roughly four hundred and seventy dollars u.s. and that's kind of crazy it does look something looks like something like Ben Heck would put out I mean very vacuum formed shell and whatnot but uh yeah if you're really interested in portable Dreamcast seriously you're better off building your own because it be way cheaper way cheaper and then finally if you wanted to pick up the you draw and you don't own a Wii you can now do that because it'll be coming on 360 and PlayStation 3 HD you draw HD you draw it's getting it's kind of some enhancements it's going to be a multi-touch tablet it's going to have a high-definition input 2,000 by 1600 resolution and you know you'll be able to do the pinch and stretch rotation area HD it's a built-in tilt sensors now you can draw penises in HD and what I of course will be coming with you draw studio or it's in this case is going to be kind of a souped-up you draw studio you draw studio instant artists with tutorials and a new interface and stuff like that of course there's gonna be supporting the different you draw titles like Pictionary and that kind of thing I don't know it's kind of interesting just from what I've seen with you draw on the Wii the support ports kind of a because it's only teach cute and stuff out and now I know that we heard rumors that maybe Nintendo might put something out for you know everyone's hoping for Mario Paint but I don't know that's that's a stretch I think but at least teach who's supporting it they've got you know the Wii I want to say there's about five games out for now so it's not bad Frisbee in our term says get a real tablet dark Tetsuya says hey look at it this way the Bob Ross game lives on you can paint happy little trees but let's be real they're all drawing penises with it by the way one thing I forgot to mention about that Duke Nukem forever demo there's a whiteboard in it that seems to exist for no other reason than for twelve-year-olds to draw penises on it yep and then the the onlookers will commentate oh that sounds like a good plan Duke you can draw a wiener on it and I'm not talking about that was done in a video for the demo I guess it was time to penis we have not asked that question in a very long time but whenever there is a new peripheral announced you always have to ask the question how long before someone either draws a dick on it or puts their dick in it real you draw time to replace five seconds it'll be the first thing many people draw that wiener I think it'd be cool though if they did you know but they really need a new magic pen Jo game seriously that would be awesome break man in our chat room says 3d vaginas are ugly yeah I saw Cloverfield to anything else that's it oh hey then let's get to more news Michael J Fox is going to be in the back to the future games yeah that's pretty cool because he wasn't in the first few but they are going to bring him back for the fifth and I guess the last game in the back to the future of course these are the telltale games episodic now here's the thing they are not going to just simply replace AJ Laskio who's been doing the voice and apparently doing a very good job Michael J Fox is going to be in the conclusion the rumor is that he's one of McFly's ancestors so yeah it's not a rumor that's actually they have video of it okay so I guess the video came out between the story I'm reading and now so yeah that's cool though that they've been able to work him in like that I think that's really cool you know a lot of people been talking about that new x-men movie and apparently it's really good it is I haven't seen it yet it's really good it's way better than three three is poop three didn't happen this movie is really good are there any good one-liners like do you know what lightning what happens when lightning hits a toad no but my favorite line in the whole movie is fuck off and you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it all right you got it but here's the thing uh as far as the x-men goes the reason why I bring it up and I forget why I bring it up why did I bring it up oh yeah we were talking about Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were originally supposed to have a cameo in it as I guess playing and you know the older versions kind of like they did in the original x-men movie but they cut it or they didn't film it and nixed it because they didn't want the new x-men movie tied to the original at all but I thought that was kind of sad because Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen like oh my god they could read the phone book and I would just be like yes tell me more and they kind of epitomize the characters that they played I mean they really did is professor Xavier of course Patrick Stewart can play anybody and he would but I that person I hear the new kids are really good too like just as younger versions they do a good job I think they did a good job but but it's just like oh my god if somebody tried to play a young captain Jean-Luc Picard like I don't think I'd ever be able to believe it I tried to do that seriously he's right they did oh that's right they did yeah seriously how fucking annoying is it that he picked Arnold Schwarzenegger be mr. freeze over Patrick Stewart it would have been perfect oh perfect give me started but no you know what it's a good thing Patrick Stewart stayed away yeah you know what it would have killed him I mean seriously it would've been real Julia all over again all right hey la noir which is a game that Loki's loaning me I'm very excited I can take it out of my queue la noir has got some download content that's gonna be coming out DLC is gonna come what may 17th all the way through July 12th and there's DLC cases that you can download one of them's called reefer madness I don't think it plays into the movie but hey the naked city let's hope we see some more nude people yeah that's coming out of May 31st for four bucks anyway if you want to buy all this stuff a la carte you can pay $20 for it but you can also pre buy all of it for ten bucks with what's called the rock star pass but you have until June 14th to take advantage of that otherwise it's going up to twelve dollars after that so there you go lots of stuff coming out that there's even I guess challenges a new suits and guns and whatever horse armor but also some the social social club things may 17th interesting stuff so la noir DLC speaking of download stuff and all this stuff Capcom has reversed a decision we reported on no actually we didn't report on this last week because I think we weren't here so Capcom did take that DRM maybe this what I've seen you remember talking about it so it was a couple weeks ago that this annoying DRM was going to be in Super Street Fighter 4 on the PC that if you are not connected to the internet it won't bork the game but you'll be limited to 15 fighters and of course people raised hell on the forums and Capcom said okay okay we're back and down yeah you we will be able to play as everybody even if not connected to the internet however as one would logically as expect you won't have online multiplayer replay sharing or watching and achievements unless you're online and logged in which yeah that does make sense I think so there you go the consumers win I think moving on we do have other news there is a Final Fantasy 5 rated by the ESRB for a PSN release in North America which is pretty good so we'll be getting lots of classic games and hopefully it's going to have the same treatment that uh that three in those had you know then we have Duke Nukem forever download content details we have the first download pack that has four weapons a minigun a new tube a sticky grenade and a BFG which we all know what BFG stands for DLC number two is a deathmatch maps there's EDF base LKR and map three it's just called map three and then the third pack is 15 new single-player maps arm wrestling and the impregnator weapon and a karaoke machine so hey also if you've pre-ordered the game you get the first DLC for free and then the last news is in Batman Arkham City you can play as Catwoman and she gets her own storyline she better not be played by Halle Berry she looks pretty hot don't get me wrong Halle Berry is hot but that movie not hot no but she looks pretty hot that's it nice all right let's get into what some Twitter topics now yeah that's right twitter.com slash olr and every week you guys can send us your tweets show us your tweets as we like to say and we read them as long as they don't suck well let's start off Twitter this week with Oh Fiedelt61 tweeted us this and I don't think we actually covered this elsewhere on the show trek movie.com reports that a video game set in the Star Trek movie universe is coming in 2012 our soccer did you hear about this it seems right up your alley Star Trek online it's gonna be set in the Abrams Trek universe I'm assuming to maybe bridge the new movie because the new movies out next year too right it is I thought they were targeting 2012 anyway well anyway it's gonna be an original story an unprecedented co-op experience players can play as Kirk and Spock so now you can be ZQ it's gonna be its own story continues the adventure of the Star Trek movie the press release that was released says that the game is filled with action-packed combat as Kirk and Spock must work together to stop a legendary enemy race bent on conquering the galaxy the story is being written by Mary Ann Kraswick she wrote for God of War and she's a BAFTA Award winner and the writer producers of the new Star Trek films so I imagine this will bridge things this is also the first full Star Trek video game since 2007 they are not counting Star Trek online but they would say that Star Trek conquest the game that came out from Bethesda because that's what most people said about it it will be coming out in 2012 I I'll check it out heck yeah I like Star Wars enough or Star Trek well I have an all tab open with the Star Wars story that's coming later my bad Essex 22 tweeted us and said just curious what you guys might consider the best downloadable co-op ps3 title want to find something a friend and I can play online any suggestions best co-op downloadable title I would suggest on review I miss what's that portal to you PC yeah I don't think you can download that though PC download it for ps3 I would say Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light is a heck of a lot of fun it's kind of like an arcade game but you could do the co-op mode that was fun I had a lot of fun playing co-op in that that would be my suggestion assuming you don't like already have it on 360 or steam I would definitely check out at least the demo for the Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light I'm actually really looking forward to that new Tomb Raider game I gotta say because you know the the download title made me interested in Tomb Raider again and I kind of like the direction they're going in with a new one the new trailers pretty hot Loki I don't know if you mess around too much with co-op games online but anything you can think of that might downloadable it's hard because I'm not sure what type of games you really like and ps3 is also kind of limited with I mean not as much stuff jumps to mind like they don't have quake 3 arena they don't have in the kind of the same selection have perfect dark and some of the same stuff that the Xbox does the pixel junk games are insanely popular I would check those out too so things to think about more tweets coming to us from the bacon bits tweeted us with something the Nintendo controller spotted at e3 but then when I bring this up in a new window I'm like this is somebody trying to be lolsy I think because what this is a picture of is I think it's just an N 64 controller all taped up yeah somebody just posted an N 64 controller I think we'll see there although that would be kind of funny if they just use the 64 controller all over again but I kind of doubt it spasminator tweets us usual drill free TV shows on the PSN store also there's free movie rentals too I gotta email him offline he's something about he set us up an account that has like movies for me to watch like shit tons of anime that's like what they have on the PlayStation Network store so that I've been kinda inundated ever since PlayStation Network came back up which by the way happened this week and has anyone tried to download the free games because yeah I don't forget what did you download I downloaded Super Stardust HD and I have infamous in my queue as well yes you get to p.s. 3 and 2 p.s. be nice huh download some anyways yes you should take up the opportunity going to some tweets from a blue swim her to LR play the opening song to Katamari Damacy on the break and thought of retro force go orange on foodie a question what will you be snacking on during the e3 pressers I'm gonna nom a bag of spicy sweet chili Doritos popcorn yet me to kettle corn vegetables because we have a bunch of them kettle corn specifically doing the Michael Jackson doing the Michael Jackson thriller gift especially during a Sony suppressor and I will be tweeting as well I can't wait to read your tweets I need that we need to look into that cover it live software I don't even know if you could use that I know you don't think it's a big deal but people people people love their Loki rage it's just gonna be the problem is I have to watch them at work I have no problem doing that because my boss is gone and his boss is gone so it's not like it's not related to your job these are the games you're gonna be selling at Christmas time I think you do have a right to watch this at work problem is they let go so many people it's like I stupid Nazis don't let me know I'll just lock the door what they're gonna do lock the door I'll lock the door to the conference room we're gonna be watching on nice HGTV there you go act deft tweets us what game or gaming related news would truly surprise you if it happened on e3 this week now we are gonna get into e3 predictions a little later but I'm gonna allow this question because it's not talking about what do you think will happen this is talking about what would surprise you if it happened is there anything that would truly surprise you if it happened Sony doesn't fuck up that surprised me the f-zero game on the Nintendo console I don't think it's gonna happen so I would say it would genuinely surprise me I would be tickled pink when I go down there on Thursday to pick up Bobby I might just have to rush the doors if the f-zero game happens there's not really much that could be surprising to me I like so I'm going in the route to this with really low expectations it's so hard to call things like that too because when I think of like surprises I think of things that literally come the fuck out of nowhere like I would say Gabe Newell getting up on stage at the Sony press conference and saying hey by the way I don't hate Sony anymore and we're gonna integrate steam in the PlayStation that was a fucking surprise like and that I I couldn't have called that I don't think anyone could have and Final Fantasy 14 as lolsy as that came up as that was two years ago let us not forget when Jack Trenton was on stage and said we're gonna be delivering Final Fantasy 14 everybody was like oh he just fucked up he meant 13 too and no it was fucking 14 was coming out already even though really was 11 but you know yeah 11 HD surprises are so hard to foresee um I would say like a very strange partnership especially from Microsoft and I know that's so vague I know the return of Xbox live experience is like 1 versus 100 I sadly think that shit is gone which pisses me off I think it was a great thing that they had but if if they were to say hey we're bringing back the multiplayer game show type events the live events on Xbox that would truly surprise me where the fuck are my Burger King Kinect games Burger King Kinect part 2 that would be your no they Burger King Kinect part 1 where the hell are they they were they promised me that they're gonna have some exclusive Burger King King Kinect games and I have yet to see these I was already the Bible because they were gonna be terrible I know the Nintendo console projects imagery any type of projector built into the Nintendo that would fucking surprise me because that is not happening the holodeck the holidays holodeck announced and it's coming to you from on live because nobody believed that shit would work either and look there it is on life presents the holodeck alright I don't want to miss these tweets from Tiger claw let me get to these top gun in days of thunder to get blu-ray game slash movie combos did you hear about that they're selling yeah I know packs I've been selling those have you really known about that for a while and they sound lame it's no it's seriously it's lame here's here's what they're doing they're doing basically what they did with the Watchmen where they take the really shitty shitty PlayStation Network games that sold like garbage and then they throw it in with the movie so that's what you're gonna get you're gonna get the really shitty garbage top gun game and the really terrible you know days of Thunder game awesome hey at least you get a movie I gotta read this comment in chat guys you don't our term says big brother on Xbox live arcade would be awesome if they don't make it I will I've got to say this I was walking through Target and I saw their Wii section of games and excuse me strawberry part um I saw for sale on the Wii the survivor game that's now available on the Wii and look I'm a fan of reality trash TV and I do watch almost every episode survivor stuff and I picked up this box I just started laughing at how horrible this game looked now have you seen the amazing race for the week I've heard that's garbage too oh I'm sure it is but I mean like actually a survivor game or something like that on Xbox live arcade in the party thing or whatever might not suck if they do it right it could actually be really fucking interesting but I just don't trust anyone to get it right because I look at this stuff that's on the Wii and I'm like oh the Wii game shows that work best are the minimalist ones like Wheel of Fortune that's pretty hard to fuck up jeopardy again pretty hard to fuck up pressure luck no whammies no whammies stop I mean somehow game show network fucked it up when they revived it but you know what I mean classic pressure luck is still gold anyhow also from Tiger Claw penny arcade comic to be adapted into a movie I had not heard about this have you heard anything about this yeah it's a spin-off it's just basically what else is the games didn't work out so well no it's not even a spin it's it's like a little three panel comic that they did the story of the Divx player no it's not even it's none of the penny arcade characters it's basically this kid who is the new kid the new kid yeah he's moving it you know normally it's moving to a new town well it's moving to a new planet and the planet has three-quarters of the gravity that you know they had on earth or whatever and so I'm guessing he's kind of like you know super strong and fast or whatever because you know you would be if you went to a planet with less gravity well the guys but everyone else would too you know no no if they grew up on that planet though it'd be they wouldn't be super strong or fast or whatever they would be adapted to that gravity where it's like it'd be just like you know for example if you had leg weights and you're running with leg weights all the time you take them off and they'll sudden you know you feel your logic there yeah I would question how much are the penny arcade people gonna actually be involved in this because they are pretty good writers and they write some really funny hilarious insightful comments and they their commentary on gaming culture has always been really good but then I read in this story here Paramount has tapped Gary Witte a former PC gamer editor-in-chief and book of Eli screenwriter to pen the new kid and I roll my eyes this has nothing to do with the penny arcade comic it just it happens to be this is a comic that they also made okay none of the characters are in it now the funny stuffs in I get that but I'm saying the penny arcade comic proves that they're good writers and I would like to see what they it's just like okay the South Park you know Trey and Matt are fucking hilarious I want to see the Book of Mormon play on that alone like it has nothing to do and I realized that that universe the South Park have nothing in common except recurring Mormon jokes over and over but I want to see that play based on the fact that I appreciate their work on the show and I think they're very good satirists that's what I'm getting at does that make sense oh all right and how that does it for tweets tonight twitter.com slash olr send us more tweets for next week or send your tweets over to Bobby because he's gonna be roaming the halls of e3 and he is your little eyebo that you can command to go look at things and by the way he did accept the challenge of going to find the giant stuffed animal at the Natsume booth and he will get chibi wolf and a cow by the way you're not getting in the car to Disneyland without swag for dark Sakura and sky probably Dan too no just for me all right let's I'm giving him such a hard time all right let's move on more news plenty more news and the mailbag and our e3 predictions just around the corner yes so Activision not to lose out on a money-making opportunity they have decided to create Call of Duty elite it is a paid digital platform being created by beachhead studios built around right now modern warfare 3 and now the service does have free aspects to it and this would include also like you know you know guild making and you know you know sharing videos and that kind of stuff it also you know tracks your stats you know very think of it like the halo waypoint almost a little bit they have of course I guess they're saying part of the fee will go towards a customer service operation that needs I guess that their supporting the back and forth so they're saying you know it's gonna have a small monthly fee and maybe like eight bucks or something and I don't know it just it sounds interesting I guess you know especially since you know a lot of the players for Call of Duty are really just online heavy it's really community driven so it makes sense that they would be doing something like this also it's a way for them to sell more you know subscriptions and make money and what not make every month off of World of Warcraft from Blizzard how could we make money every month offer other big games yeah why bother having them you know share videos on YouTube for free when they can do it on our service and we could just take down all the videos on YouTube well I don't think they would do that but and I think a lot of its you know still free but they have like a video out there that you can check out that has kind of some of the you know features of it and stuff it sounds a little bit also I don't know if anyone remembers because it's been around for at least a few months now since Medal of Honor but remember there's also the EA's gun club or whatever so they've got you know that kind of thing as well going on on the EA side so yeah I guess I don't know it makes sense that they're kind of doing this sort of stuff and I'm sure they're gonna have like you know betas for you know paid members and stuff like that just a way to get people it kind of think of it like the PlayStation Plus program or something like that I don't know if you're hardcore that it's worth it to you well even for those of us that don't get it quote unquote we just go lol more money well even if you don't like for example if you're not that hardcore into it though you know you can at least get some stuff out of the you know the free free portion of it like they haven't you like your career stats or all that stuff if you like the stat tracking and I think they even have the the hot points on the map and stuff where most of the players are you know converging on and stuff like that so I don't know it check out the free portion if you if it's not for you then you don't have to do it it's simple as that you know we were talking a lot on Horde house today about $25 amounts and Wow and why people buy them and you know it some of us look at it and go why in the hell would you spend that money on them out but for some people it's like pretty Barbie you know so you can't it's your money spending on whatever you want hey some details on the 3ds shop launch excite bike 3d is gonna be the free game that is on the 3ds shop when it launches June 6th tomorrow right holy crap that's coming out of nowhere mmm what you're shaking your finger no my my finger that means whoop these shit okay oh you're twirling your finger my bad all right the eShop launches this week and it's gonna be giving you excite bike 3d free for 30 days I'm sure that will be fantastic in 3d I'm sure it will fully utilize the power of the 3ds goddamn NES game which is the the layers that's what those layers NES games are gonna do it this like the background is one layer and the sprites are a front layer and it's all in effect that's it but you know there are a lot of people will pick it up and play it and go oh but I will download it because it's free yeah it's free but I think I'm buying any of your other fucking games other NES games and you know spinning unfortunately it doesn't have internet play plus how are they gonna work that out did wasn't the original excite bike kind of borked because there was a load save mode they could fix that we get the original excite bike was a disc game and then when they put it on the cartridge like it just flat-out didn't work when they really fix that I thought when they even came the virtual console though maybe I can't remember maybe somebody in chat this is why we have a live chat room somebody will jump in here in a moment but anyway let me give you some more details excite bike 3d classic will be free you want after 30 days you know how much that was such a back six bucks that's retard well that's a bunch of tacos well it's the five dollar NES game plus a dollar premium which is interesting that's not we points that's 599 it sounds like they're walking away from we points that that's that's right because it was so hard to calculate we points based on the one-to-one ratio that they had their 500 we points that's five dollars also Game Boy ports Super Mario Land alleyway and radar mission will all be out on day one DSI and DSI XL owners will be able to transfer most of the DSI where purchases to the system there are some things that are not going to be transferable I believe all of it has to do with like license things like the Domo Coon games don't transfer over because they probably weren't licensed for more than they came out over here I I didn't know they did either it might only be a Japanese thing IDK well DSI where I obviously I'd never really downloaded any DSI were so hold on though this is huge pokey decks 3d a virtual compendium of Pokemon from black and white it is a free download it will allow you to just look up all the information in the world on the Pokemon 3d models StreetPass functionality you unlock random Pokemon by exchanging data I don't know if that ties in the black why I don't think it does it's something to do with the pokey decks and QR code support you take a picture of your friend set it as a background layer snap a picture of a QR code to introduce a Pokemon like what whatever I think it's also got the AR cards or whatever support so you can do the 3d models whatever I got to admit it sounds I just can't wait for all the fucking mudkips because you know it's just a matter of time before we get you know Oprah introducing mudkips uh let's see do they have that I has your mudkips also Japan and Europe you are also getting stuff on launch day for some reason it's always got to be different you will in Japan get mega man dr. Wiley's revenge kirby's dreamland baseball and phantasm which was called avenging spirit over here downtown special kuni kun no G guy geeky dio Zenon Shugo it's a River City ransom spin-off with samurais also in the magic word Kunio also in Japan on June 7th excite bike 3d mystery pi 3d block breaking and Xevious will be announced or released as well which I played at last year's e3 and it was the background on one layer and the sprites on the front layer Europe gets excite bike alleyway Mario Land and tennis every Thursday will Europe see more games on the 3ds so there you go all those announcements out now so they don't have to talk about it at the press conference because they will be spending all of their time undoubtedly talking about not just the new console but I'm sure they will first parade out skyward sword for an update they'll parade out 3ds titles including the Mario title and maybe some surprises there on the 3ds and then easily half to two-thirds will be about whatever this cafe thing is slashes pop in our chat room says look under your seat it's a mudkip you get a mudkip and you get a mudkip everyone's getting a mudkip yeah is there a be Pokemon all right forget it well how about some other news for Nintendo the the DS light actually will have actually today has a price reduction it's gone down to $99 sucks for all you the bought one yesterday yep but I guess they're just trying to clear out inventory who knows but the games are still the games there's not getting a price reduction pro tip I saw them foursquare I know you stopped using foursquare but there is a pretty good deal on it still check into Toys R Us and you get buy one get one half off on DS and 3ds titles pro tip okay I'm which I don't think I got into it on this show I was talking about it more on the Bobby call at the end of his show but I'm convinced whatever this Nintendo controller is their little touch screen thing I was saying on Bobby show you know Nintendo has been making touch screens controllers for about five six years now it's called the DS and the bottom half of that that's gonna be your controller it's a touchscreen with buttons you've had one all along it would be amazing if the DS would just work as a controller but let's not let's there'll be a special new button or there'll be something extra on this thing Rob all right moving on Loki freestyle games I may remember them from such series as DJ hero well thankfully they are not dead which is good apparently though I guess they have confirmed 35 positions will be lost but they still have a strong partnership with Activision and they're currently working on a new innovative unannounced project and it says of course they plan to share details about those project or the said project in the next coming months it's good to see that they're still around hopefully we'll get Lisa DJ hero 3 out of them yeah that would be cool I would appreciate that Rama's correcting me on something in the chat room nope you get your money back if there's a price drop within two weeks of purchase you get the difference back well now that really depends on what story you buy it at but okay fine I'll play your game here and say sucks for those that bought it 15 days ago why are you buying a DS now I mean seriously buy something else the 3ds will slowly add value before Christmas before Christmas you're gonna see and there will be time like you're gonna probably see the Netflix on 3ds in action and some of this at the conference and all this so I think the 3ds is gonna see a lot more added value before Christmas time it's just us early adopters we got Street Fighter pilot wings Ridge Racer IDK steel diver that's Zelda oh yeah Zelda yeah a game we played 10 years ago it was overrated then alright love of God publisher stop making your old games making an old game HD is not a fucking new game okay who remembers a company called origin do you remember this company origin I believe they didn't have the ultimate games back in the day yes the only origin I know of is the ones that as the cosmetic company yeah well origin yeah they did the ultimate games which is huge get this EA but origin system some time ago it was like 20 years ago they bought it was a long time ago they're bringing back the brand so to speak or at least the name with a direct to consumer gaming platform here it is it's an EA store it's basically a competitor to steam EA has launched the service and more than 150 games are already available on the service it's also gonna have exclusive limited edition stuff like battle field 3 Alice madness returns kingdoms of Amalur Star Wars the Old Republic is supposedly going to be downloadable only on origin origin will have its own application which you can find connect with friends blah blah blah download play PC games basically they're doing everything that seems doing trying to get a little more competition in space because let's face it the games for Windows live thing really hasn't you know just broke through like I think Microsoft is hoping it would apparently the service is also going to work on mobile devices Scrabble mobile versions of battlefield 3 all of that will be on the origin store as well speaking of Ultima randomly I did read an article that Ultima 4 is now like free-to-play online so if you want to go back and play like a classic RPG that will just it's as hard to it's it's just really a difficult title the NES version really dumped it up and it still was really hard I would check out Ultima 4 that's what RPGs were when I was a kid and we liked it more information I'm sure at EA's press conference which is at 1230 Pacific 330 Eastern on Monday on right now is the orange lounge radio mailbag every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer will dive in pick a few of her favorites and read them right now on the air well we got a bunch so I'm only gonna read four and I picked them at random and I didn't pick any that were by the same person okay so that was my criteria so if you're not getting read don't worry I probably and you shouldn't get butthurt if you're not getting read I mean I don't want to sound like we have ego here but we do have a nice listenership we appreciate everybody that listens but when you all email us at once we can't read it all or it would be a seven-hour show it's nothing personal yes I would like to say that if you've got something to send us just do it in one email I don't care if it's really long I would prefer the one email so this one comes from Holly exactly how stupid is this guy who complained about it and it's actually about the portal to being offended offending seriously GLaDOS is the villain Wheatley is the villain they're supposed to make you feel bad and insult you my husband is 200 pounds overweight and he found the fat jokes absolutely hilarious why because they are villains how thick in the head do you have to be to think that the game is offensive because the villain insults people more to the point she does it in the first game so you're telling me that the moron bought the first game heard it ignored it and then decided to be offended the second game you know I I know why okay you know I know why there wasn't a rapture on Saturday God look down at the world and facepalmed I think to a god this was a ugly story last week but yeah I mean GLaDOS was very you couldn't take GLaDOS seriously you know what I mean like the way the character was built and Wheatley was designed to be the dumbest moron that ever lived end quote to me that whole thing was just sensationalist media and it's just unfortunate like yeah people are gonna get offended but you know what we all get offended they were completely the the news quote professionals did they ever respond to you by the way no of course not highly unprofessional mm-hmm don't believe anything that they say more emails this one comes through the website just wanted to get your opinions on some things what did you think of the original gold my double-oh-seven and perfect dark I myself enjoy these games quite a bit because I'm a big fan of first-person shooters keep up the good work sincerely CD Thunder well um they both made me throw up not because they were bad they were bad at all golden I was really great but I've told the story before when I first moved out here and lived with Dan he had a Nintendo 64 play golden I mm-hmm and I would end up rolling over on the couch and staring at the back of the couch because I was so nauseous that I could not watch him play so I would listen to him play golden I was simply a landmark title like it just it did so much for first-person shooters that's what that's why they tried to imitate it on the Wii and try to hit gold twice but it kind of you know it just wasn't the same you know and that's the unfortunate thing with a lot of these retro updates it's just not the same well the first golden I came at what 15 years ago no not that long well whenever the movie was out it was late night well yeah so I guess it's the difference between you know trying to capture that same it's like movie remakes now you just can't capture the same joy now perfect dark perfect dark the 361 that was a launch title I didn't care for it all but the original perfect dark was pretty awesome and it's fun to play on Xbox Live now just just saying well we got another one through the website this is from Cal Roo I understand that the news is trying to blame the game okay this is probably more about the portal thing I understand that the news is trying to blame the game for poor dialogue and dark soccer was blaming the news channel for their poor investigation but neither of you guys really looked at the real issue and that is the rating the this person is using such a horrible gram there's no punctuation in here there's none but one ellipse okay anyway so the game was rated e 10 plus and should have been rated T so a lot of the concepts in the game seemed to be a little over the head of the ten-year-old so let's stop blaming games and blame the rating system well yeah the rating system is shit anyway but I knew what adoption was when I was 10 I didn't you know it doesn't matter I actually think the emailer has a wee bit of a point but at the same time it's no rating boards responsibility to fill the role of a parent and I don't know it's it's it's it's a really tough call like I get this perspective a lot like even though you might have known what it was when you were 10 I can see where maybe there wasn't enough warning that hey there might be some jokes that are gonna go over a 10 years old 10 year olds head and maybe this game really should be only played by teens and up like I gotta be honest would I let my kid play portal I would yeah I don't think it's really dangerous but that's but then again I don't have these sensitivities to watch out for I got a baby to stop crying by playing portal to seriously dance cousin was over here and her baby was crying in her lap so I asked if I could hold him and then I held him while I was playing portal to in my lap and he thought it was amazing let me put it this way as far as his email goes it's a fair argument I'm just not sure I agree but I think this is a it's a valid counter point I'll give you that I can see it I mean I honestly think that they should just rate them the way they do movies mm-hmm then people would get it because apparently I honestly think that a lot of people especially ones who are not gamers and that our parents now don't want to understand it they want other people to do their thinking for them and that's not acceptable so honestly if you've got to answer a difficult question because you didn't do any research into the game guess what that's on you tricky-tricky is there more to the email or is that okay one more yeah one more another one through the website I was picking the short ones okay a few shows ago you picked you picked this this is towards me all a few shows ago you picked up this old game called phantasmagoria I remember playing it when I was 15 and absolutely loved it soon after that I played Gabriel Knight the beast within after thinking back of those games I started to wonder if there are any recent games out there that are point-click horrors all I've seen so far are mysteries and unfortunately it's more aimed at children I want my horror and gore sad face toodles sill I love sill yeah stills still lived in amps they I don't know if she was in the capital of Holland but she was in Dutch country and then she moved to Britain not that long ago she's not in London but she's you know in another part of the country and yeah we had her own a hoard house couple weeks ago she hosts the girls gone Wow podcast which is a lot of fun you should go on that show except at the time they tape it's probably like 3 a.m. if they do it on a weekend and I don't have school the next day but anyway back to the question itself phantasmagoria yeah there really hasn't been a game like that a long time there was the Silent Hill game only was kind of point-and-click II but not quite yeah I mean there's there's one extreme of the other I know what she's talking which talk about the Nancy Drew games are kind of like those mystery games that they're kind of kitty they still have those coming on we oh yeah those well and they still come out on PC as well those things still sell pretty well um as well for what they are I'm gonna do a quick bit of research on uh but yeah I mean if you want to go to the console side I mean Silent Hill games still have you know the gore and the fun stuff and not just Silent Hill but Resident Evil what are some of the other big horror franchise series we have and click games scary games we have monster basement 2 we have abandoned to dead-end hotel haunted trap soul orchestrated death inculation x mortis 3 which looks pretty gory the holes crime evidence to you know what actually game was kind of scary this is space this is actually a point-and-click games calm you know what else actually remember the room thank you so salacious pop is jumping up and down in chat I have to say this amnesia because I was thinking of that game too I'm like what's that game that was on steam amnesia yeah amnesia is supposed to be a scary as hell title on that's on PCs I would check out amnesia for sure and that's a point-and-click well but do you remember the little flash game that's called the room or crimson room or something like that Rob do you remember that I'm sorry one more time sorry I was catching up on chat do you remember a game called like it was like crimson room or scarlet room where it was this one where you are in a room on a bed and it's just a little flash game but you have to figure out how to get out of the room and different stuff happens in the room you like you find a lighter and you have to like light some water and make steam to set off something and then you get a string that falls out of somewhere and the whole point is trying to get out of the room is that like don't shit your pants no that's a whole other type of I'll see if I can find it link the chat room but that one it wasn't really so much of a scary game per se but it was sort of like kind of imagining yourself in that situation made it frightening that's what I thought was interesting about it I love that game by the way don't shit your pants it's great game is that it for emails okay I think I actually found it the scarlet room mailbag out orange lounge reader calm if you want to send us emails don't be butthurt if you don't get through though it happens there's also the forms nobody freaking posts on the orange laundry forms and I think we need to fix that we need to make that our mission this year to have some hop and forums so we need to encourage more discussion on the forums we're gonna work on that anyhow that's it for the mailbag yes all right we're gonna get into a game tonight and we're gonna do this with predictions and we're gonna do this in the style of an old board game called taboo remember the game taboo in taboo there were certain phrases that you wanted to say but there were certain things that you didn't want to say so the oil our hosts we're gonna go around right now and give our predictions five things you will see at e3 and five things you won't see at e3 so for everything that you will see at e3 that is in indeed announced that host will earn a point now see we can't tally this up till later in the week but for everything that you won't see that they do say there's gonna be a buzz and that host will lose the point and the host with the most points by whenever we have another show next Sunday after next will win tacos yay so they'll have to buy themselves yes no I if it's not me I will buy tacos if I win then Jamie has to make me tacos all right so here we go five things we think will happen and five things that won't happen let's start with the wills and we'll start with dark Sakura something you will see at e3 this year Microsoft will announce a halo game for connect Microsoft will announce a halo game for connect we're going on kind of a kind of a safe bet I think going off the rumors there right but and actually I blame Dan for my entire list so really he has to buy you tacos if I lose all right fair enough all right so Dan Dan wants the tacos if you win and we'll see what happens all right Loki you got one for us new Super Mario Brothers sequel announced well that's a real safe bet you guys are playing a super easy here you should get a half point for that one all right fine a new Super Mario Bros now I'm gonna I'm gonna go all in I'm gonna make a crazy-ass prediction here I'm gonna say well this isn't that crazy but I think it will be announced at e3 Diablo 3 gets announced for console especially after having played the dungeon siege 3 demo earlier this week I think it can be done and I think Activision is gonna really push blizzard to put that out on the console just to test the waters we'll see I could be full of garbage but this is just for fun right dark Sakura Sony will talk about network security Sony will talk about network security yes they'll talk about how great their online is now know that they're gonna toot their own horn some more and talk about how they're the safest it's gonna be Sony auto fellatio all right fair enough Loki something you will see a new Grand Theft Auto sequel be announced once again playing it very safe that's right a new Grand Theft Auto sequel announced fair enough I'm gonna go out on limb see I'm going crazy I'm gonna say that the hardcore we title that is going to get you back to playing Nintendo III think it's gonna be Star Fox I think it's new Star Fox game will be announced for the cons the new whatever console it is I think if the whole touchscreen thing is true I could definitely see there being mapping and plotting and communications popping up from your little cohorts but most telling of all the fact that there is a Star Fox game in the works being ported for 3ds blast from the past to kind of raise awareness of the franchise again I think Star Fox is gonna be the franchise that gets announced for Nintendo its new console dark soccer they're gonna verify the name of the new PSP the what of the new handheld PlayStation they're gonna verify the name yes it's already leaked I said they were going to announce it uh-huh and before I realized that it had been put out mm-hmm so I said they're going to verify it all right and I'm gonna have to send you the list so you can yeah you'll have to send it to me so you can pile it and look you'll have to do that to IDK and if you guys want to throw out your ideas in chat room chat.org laundry.com things you think will happen at e3 Loki I think that there will be a minor price drop on the Xbox 360 console and connect hardware announced so like a bundle thing no I'm saying they're gonna drop the price of the system and they're also gonna drop the price of the Kinect interesting okay try to get more people on board yeah exactly because that's what they're pushing so you know makes sense that they would try to drop to the price of the console down all right the last drop was back in I don't you know when the last drop was actually um I'm gonna say that these because Soul Calibur 5 we know it's gonna be there the Soul Calibur 5 bonus characters are Capcom inspired this time around they're not gonna be Star Wars absolutely not Star Wars because we've already had that and I think this time they've already done like some of the other big franchises so I think this time Soul Calibur 5 will have Capcom and I'm saying this because of the whole kind of we see them working together in Tekken cross Street Fighter and Street Fighter cross Tekken the one that comes to mind right away Dante I think Dante will be a character in Soul Calibur 5 that's my prediction okay two more Star Sakura um mine was more portal to download content more portal to download content all right like oh like the valve will show off like the user creator stuff yeah there'd be that maybe new maps that they did and more more fun all right Loki this is kind of retarded but new Animal Crossing game announced oh so you think that's gonna be the Nintendo title that comes out the gate I'll be a 3ds hell for sure oh you think it'll be a 3ds thing yeah all right um let's see I'm gonna say that valve will show defense of the ancients 2 which I think is a risky pick for me because I think valve is pretty much said they're not showing anything already but I kind of think this game is ready to be shown more of because it's kind of their next big thing they've got in the pipeline so I think defense of the ancients 2 is gonna show up at e3 and one more prediction to round out the five Dark Sakura oh I broke from IRC darn it Dark Sakura um there was well Loki already said it but it was on my list I'm gonna say it anyway an Xbox 360 price drop that's fine if somebody's list is duplicated that's fine in fact I will say one of the things that you said will show at e3 I have in my will not so this is going to be good interesting all right um my oh sorry Loki your fifth and final DS titles on the new Nintendo system will be on their virtual console or download service where the hell they're gonna call it say it virtual console so DS titles on new Nintendo system virtual console sorry black wolf posted in chat the picture from e3 and those that I saw those same creatures in what miklotov sent me those are the rage creatures yeah I saw there was a thing I could talk to where they're all boxed up or whatever they're having they're setting them up okay my last one on my list is I'm gonna go for kind of an easy one Nintendo will demo 3d Netflix I think this is a big thing that they're gonna be showing at e3 and they're gonna be showing 3d Netflix did we disconnect I think we did my win app is crashed I'm still on IRC hold on we're gonna keep recording for the sake of the podcast we are not broadcasting right now hold on just keep up keep going no I know you guys are connected the the win amp crashed over here that's what's wrong okay good old live radio and the pitfalls of it okay we should be connected again so to recap I don't do you have all your five written down let's recap the five things we think will happen so dark soccer your list again a halo game for Kinect network security from Sony verifying the name of the PSP or whatever in GP vitamin more portal to download content and Xbox 360 price drop okay Loki the five things you said will happen and no particular order minor press drop on the Xbox 360 console and Kinect hardware new Animal Crossing game announced a new Grand Theft Auto game announced and new Super Mario game announced and I mean like a new new Super Mario Brothers because that's kind of confusing and redundant and then DS DS titles on the Nintendo new Nintendo system virtual console okay and then my list of five things you will see Diablo 3 announced for a console Star Fox announced as the hardcore Wii title the Soulcalibur 5 bonus characters are Capcom inspired think Dante valve will show defense of the ancients 2 and Nintendo will demo 3d Netflix ok so let's go to the five things you won't see so if these things are said the host loses a point they get buzzed like in tab oops so let's see what the five things that were putting on the card that they won't say stark soccer what's your first one no Final Fantasy 7 remake I think that's a very safe bet everyone puts that on the I want to see it list every year and it's not gonna happen yep that's a good one alright so I have no Final Fantasy 7 Loki this would make me sad but no excite truck sequel probably not gonna happen I I actually put on my list Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outlet outage directly there I'm gonna say that they will not say something about we apologize for the downtime they're gonna try to look forward not backward that's not to say they won't say secure security and they will emphasize existing security but I don't think you're gonna hear an apology for what happened you already got that supposedly so I don't think they're gonna announce the outage directly we'll see though dark soccer your next one my next one is and this makes me sad Half-Life 2 episode 3 will not be announced nothing Loki I was gonna say the new Nintendo I don't even know see this is the problem I don't even know if they're gonna announce the price but the new Nintendo system will not be under $250 now that's a that's a good guess what do you think it will cost $2.99 I think it's gonna be $2.99 the controllers are gonna be a lot more expensive that's it price is gonna be difficult but they're gonna have to justify it somehow I think the controllers will be $79 $79 99 79 99 and they're gonna be half a DS my list my number two thing on things you won't see killer instinct sorry file that in the fanboy went category too and there's been rumblings this year that it's supposed to come back now no enjoy your Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter remakes and all this because that's as good as it's gonna get dark soccer no new Microsoft or Sega system well you know people there is rumors every year about a Microsoft portable so dark soccer saying nope not happening Loki I would have to say probably that there there's not going to be like I don't even know what you'd call it like the one versus 100 type thing anymore they're not gonna announce you know some sort of community gaming type thing no more community games yeah okay fair enough I'm gonna say that one thing you won't see a Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you will see big pushes on 13 to instead they're gonna just it's not that they're gonna try to erase that 14 ever happened but they're gonna push 13 to before they try to revisit 14 I think dark soccer Sega will make a good Sonic game that's something you won't see that's a good one that's gonna be hard to see we'll have to see what the feedback is in the show floor I suppose all right Loki you will not see a new dance masters game probably not I would you go so far as to say you will not see a non-ddr konami dance game a non-ddr konami dance game yes I would go that far okay funny enough my number four is about a music game as well I don't think you're gonna see a DJ game from harmonix and when I say DJ game from harmonix I mean one that involves a turntable controller because it could be that the new are obviously whatever harmonix makes is gonna be music based but I don't want that interpretation to be too loose I'm talking turntable and keys not happening I think harmonix is gonna go somewhere new with something you haven't thought of and let's see dark soccer let's wrap up the lesson number five Duke Nukem booth dudes as in like you know scantily clad men what if there is a Duke Nukem with that that doesn't count all right I said like you know like scantily clad dudes okay fair enough logi this is gonna be kind of a risky one but and not including because I know that these are coming out because you know I look at this kind of stuff not including these like greatest hits re-releases or third-party games you will not see any new first-party PSP games no new first-party PSP games that's a and I'm talking about actual UMD discs I'm not talking about some stupid like download content I'm talking first-party UMD PSP games black wolf in our chat is calling shenanigans on the fact that you have a Konami thing on your list when they already did a press conference however I'm actually gonna back you up because that doesn't mean it was everything because we don't know what Nintendo's got and anything that Konami is making for the new Nintendo system is under wraps and I I would stand by the fact that just because they didn't say it in their little pre thing doesn't mean it doesn't exist like glee karaoke revolution wasn't in their thing guarantee you there's another one of those coming so I'm gonna allow it even though it's probably a safe bet it will still count for tacos all right and my last answer this is a duplicate and it's it's a painful one but I also put you will not see half-life anything sorry Alan I actually wrote it just like that half-life anything sorry Alan yeah I thought of Alan when I put that but I will keep him when I was at work I would plug in my my little iPhone and listen to all the dialogue through half-life 2 well the episodes mm-hmm and that's how I got through half nice because I couldn't you know didn't play much at home so I got to hear the entire game so I was like what more what happens all right let's recap the five buzz things the things that will cause a host

anything sorry Alan alright so we'll see what develops next week I've got to bring in the actual buzzer when we do the recaps oh we've got one sounds of failure has the family feud buzzer oh yeah there's the sound effects thing the tire clogged maybe like a year ago with all the you know you said I use that on it for Dan shadow every time he makes a joke we play sad trombone oh yeah there it is it's bookmarked right here sound effects of failure so here you go sorry so when they say hey it's a sonic game that doesn't suck Oh dark Sakura I like that when you click it then it does the X that's funny I like the toilet flush too all right anyhow let's move on we gotta get the F use the week done because if we don't get our angst out then I don't know what happens with something bad I accidentally kicked Loki oops I tried to voice him and kicked him instead fuck you to Sally Hansen's miracle nail thickener it doesn't work and it bubbles and it stinks really bad too so thank you Sally Hansen company for taking five dollars of my money fuckers and also fuck you to feeling like crap in my intestines all day eating all those delicious cupcakes last night damn it Rob why'd you have to bring this delicious orange cupcakes they were orange creamsicle I knew you would love that because they tasted like the blood orange pinkberry by the way I'm riding a high this week because pinkberry tweeted me this week and they could they did tell me the blood they told me personally on Twitter the blood orange will be back this makes me happy but salted caramel is fucking good oh my god chocolate no I just had it with a little shavings oh lord have it swirled with chocolate trust me this episode was brought to you by amazing I'm sitting here with two pinkberry gift cards on here god I wish I didn't close at 10 on Sundays all right my F you the week goes to a lack of pinkberry my F you the week goes to the thing freezing up and dumping the listeners for like 10 minutes and I didn't even realize it because we weren't connected in chat still and my F you the week goes to me for not trying harder to do III this year I think I think in retrospect I probably should have done it I'm really looking forward to this whole coverage and kind of trying something different but I don't know it's it's gonna be sad kind of missing all the atmosphere of e3 but at the same time my wallet says thank you but I know there's Disneyland that's gonna rock it's a small world okay you're not gonna subject Bobby that's a small world yes I am no I am gonna take Bobby on it's a small world if you won't go in California screaming he has to go and it's a small world that's the compromise three times in a row I'm not that mean but Bobby you get to pick you you're either gonna go on California screaming or it's a small world and when you ride it's a small world dark soccer and I will be singing I will warn you it's a small world last longer than California scream in 15 minutes and me who gets bad vertigo and hates roller coasters can do California screaming just fine and then or Tower of Terror I cannot now I can't do Tower of Terror I tried to take Bobby on Tower of Terror Daniel go on Tower of Terror I love to I love Tower dance in the other I'm saying I'm gonna tell her Janice Dan I scream like a girl on Tower of Terror now when I came off of Tower of Terror I was so dizzy that I could not walk straight okay all right back to F use the week sorry Loki F you to Disneyland talk I guess happy not being able to go to E3 really like to have gone to E3 not necessarily to be able to see all the wonderful boots and stuff because I'd be in my own hotel room being able to sleep all night long oh how I wish I could sleep all night long my baby doesn't understand that he needs to sleep at least when your baby is 13 he can mow the lawn oh this is what I have to say parents have no right to complain because they picked this I didn't pick for the child not to sleep through the night you picked to have one yeah I understand that goes with it is it your fault if you buy a car and explodes on you but it's a given that babies wake up at 3 in the morning hungry or poopy or have to pee or that they want mommy all the time it's not really actually all of our friends don't have a problem with that it's just baby nature it's just that our child decides hey you know what I need to be swaddled still at 10 my I wake up that morning some past me whatever you know he just we moved him into his own room so that's also an additional bit of fun I'm just used to it now I wake up at 4 in the morning every day so all right let's move on to a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line 1 8 7 7 game olr yippie yippie or our username on Skype orange launch radio please if you are going to use Skype please take this opportunity now to call echo 1 2 3 and make sure your connection works even if you've called us before orange launch video on Skype or 1 8 7 7 game olr after two more stories Loki yes so this is kind of cool you know there's been a lot of rumors that there's going to be gaming coming to the Apple TV device but everyone seems to forget hey you know what there's other things out there that you can stream movies on to and now Rovio is actually negotiating with developers to create games specifically for their Roku box and it will I guess be TV based games you know casual stuff and they've really said how the controller gonna work I guess it may be the you know new boxes or whatever can come with a controller but it's kind of neat though to see the gaming is coming to everything I mean I sure won't be long before we're just you know having internet able the TVs that you're playing games off of without any sort of additional software yeah on live without any additional software well I well the boxes that I understand that I'm talking about in internet enabled TV alright alright whatever alright so would you be interested in a Roku box now I had a feeling there's no reason alright let's move on you poor guys are bullying Bobby into writing no no I'm just being honest because keep in mind the first time I read California Screamin I wrote it in the middle and got sick as fuck at least we'll go on Toy Story Midway Mania and that right is amazing it is but no when I when I started writing California Screamin in the front car never got sick again it's the same like being in the front seat of the car I get motion sick in the backseat in the front seat of mine alright one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line this story is about Animal Crossing but it might not be what you're expecting it's a story that Kotaku ran earlier this week and I guess it was kind of from another site called anti pixelante.com here's the deal it's a story about I don't even know where to go here with Animal Crossing the tie the story is titled if you could bone one Animal Crossing character who would it be and the site anti pixelante.com has actually combed the depths of I guess what is this site called like rule 34 which I guess rule 34 is an internet rule about if it exists there's porn full of it so these people anti pixelante.com actually combed the website to find what Animal Crossing characters were most popular on rule 34 and believe it or not there were 59 pornographic images of the stitch lady that helps you to the crop make your own patterns Hazel yeah Hazel so Hazel was the most popular character with 59 pornographic images next up and I'm surprised he wasn't number one Tom Nook was second place with 30 and then the other well it's Abel and Mabel or something like that isn't it the Abel sisters the Abel sisters the other Abel sister had Mabel and Mabel and then KK whatever he is okay KK was 13 and then I don't even know who that last chick is that's the hair the hair style it's the hair lady all right now if you want to know what animal showed up the most that raccoon cock that actually gives me a whole new incentive to play Animal Crossing again I want to make the most offensive village possible we almost did that with mine remember I had the town I had the town lesbian and we had people running around saying cocksucker yes they show this posting of a board where somebody is written you know how you can write your own messages on the board in town Nook special we've got a very special item in today yes it's Nook's fat raccoon cock come check it out at Nookington's anyhow what villagers were most shown in compromising positions believe it or not 15 different cats compromising 138 tabby was number one at 36 porno images am I really reporting on this of tabby think you are six different wolves 111 humans four or what four different elephants ten bunnies nine squirrels and seven dogs dogs only shown 20 times the mummy dog was in seven different pornographic images people like you know the bandaged up people I don't know what to say about that anymore the fact I'm looking god bless the internet that's the only thing I can think of where worse I'm trying to find with pictures are the actual pictures are not there you have to go to that rule 34 and I'm a little afraid to go to that site all right fine you know what fine I will fucking go to rule 34 only because I'm on Jamie's computer my computer that's the orange lounge computer that's the one that our listeners built us okay then I'm going on the listener computer let's see what is this website here doo doo doo doo doo rule 34 other real and I'm gonna copy I'm just really afraid of what I'm about to see when I go to this website this could be worse than two girls one cup and I'm waiting for it to load there's an animal crossing movie and let's see okay I'm gonna search oh yeah I have that already do they have it subtitled I think I've got it subtitled somewhere tiger client chatroom says sky you do realize what you're getting yourself into furry porn look I it's my job to be an objective reporter and if there's news I want to post to that link what did you want to say about it what I want to say about it typical internet I mean come on seriously if it's gonna be a character they're gonna have sex with somebody this stupid website's timing out I think cuz we're trying to do a show like I'm searching for Animal Crossing and nothing's happening there's images though someone on Yahoo answers said uh what was it actually asked to see if it had been done yet this website kind of sucks well on India though there's a rule 34 with two ad at to doing it this is great all right forget it the segments going nowhere one eight seven seven game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call we will chat about whatever please not rule 34 for the love of God again eight seven seven game olr our username on skype orange lounge radio meanwhile how about last minute stories apparently there's you know of course the connect Star Wars game is being shown by the way these connects Star Wars game based on the video footage that we've seen so far looks very terrible lag-tastic fun also apparently there is going to be a Disneyland adventures game for connect where you run around Disneyland and ride rides and stuff like that sounds like a game that you two would be picking up yeah well some this is kind of awful there is a a modder for a Super Smash Brothers brawl that made a mod for that replacing solid snake with Conan O'Brien and he in fact even does his string dance at the end of the round it's awesome so I don't think I don't know if there's a place you can download that forms dot kc dash m i m dot com slash gallery slash brawl or slash brawl view dot php question mark number one thousand sure people are writing this down furiously well thank you know what they download the podcast and they can go back and rewind it and stuff like that and get everything number equals 19,000 277 alright or just go search on Kotaku you can find it interesting also the Melger's and zone of vendors collection those collections will actually be downloadable as well so if you don't want to purchase the box sets and maybe you only want one title in HD you can download those I believe separately so that's gonna be kind of neat I found you subtitled animal crossing on YouTube and link to you I will share with everybody and then let's see if that's just the trailer is that the whole movie movie very cool let's see also I was gonna talk about here apparently mad cats you know following the footsteps of red octane are actually becoming game publishers themselves they have launched thunderhawk studios and they are developing a flight sim game neat ok I did it I did a search on the whole animal crossing and Tom Nook and nothing came up I found one in this website blows of Tom Nook and Tom Nook right we go to 4chan I'm definitely not going there on dark soccer's computer the show computers I don't know what will affect it with we have a call we have a call have fun digging to that we have a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this I'm just trying to stop all the Animal Crossing talk that's all hi Bobby how are you I'm doing good are you excited for e3 I don't know if I'm excited more for e3 or not going on California screaming yeah I'm trying to get them to stop picking on you but you know you should be glad my friend Victoria isn't going because she says I have a rule you go on every ride once and if you don't like you never have to go on it again but I'm a little more forgiving if somebody says no Rob I'm really not going on I'm like okay whatever I did that I'm not gonna bully I went on I went on a Tower of Terror and it sucks but if Bobby's like I don't want Bobby to barf so if he's gonna barf he's not going on it anyway yes yeah I wouldn't barf what it is is I do have a medical condition and I will pass out and I don't want to pass out if Disney doesn't want me to pass out because then they escort you out of the park yes you will have to you will have to hydrate him and watch over him if he passes out because you forced me to go on that right all right Dan's like then we get to go backstage all right look we're playing the little game tonight about things you will see and things you won't see at e3 and you're calling shenanigans on Loki's list I know but so Bobby I'm gonna put you on the spot I won't make you name five but tell me something you think we will see maybe that we missed something we will see is something we won't see well I mean the won't see is actually I had a call on my show tonight that asked me you know what what would you not see there and I said a new Space Quest or really any new Sierra adventure titles I think that's a pretty fair guess yeah because I mean I can't see Activision re resurrecting King's Quest or anything like that well have we had the telltale King's Quest games were announced didn't that come out a few months ago yeah but we won't see it at e3 I'm gonna get my buzzer ready I'm not playing all right fine we'll see we'll see all right what about something that will happen something that will I'm you know it's kind of hard because like I've seen a lot of the stuff that you know kind of is going in and stuff what we will see I I think we will I think we will get a price on the Nintendo I think they will say the price interest even though it's end of 2012 I think they're gonna go ahead and announce a price or at least something they're aiming for yes hmm okay that's a pretty fair really it's end of 2012 I thought it would be the same launch frame as 3ds Wow I didn't realize that boy that's a long tease now what I want to see is I want to see them do pac-man versus is one of the demo games they could they could re-release all that stuff that they did for the Game Boy Advance connect cable that nobody ever played can they will because that's Nintendo oh well that's easy let's do it that way the only one that probably wouldn't happen is Crystal Chronicles because that wasn't first party that was a weird game I liked it but it was weird it wasn't really fantasy it was just kind of in that storyline I guess all right well any other thoughts for us Bobby before we talk to you again on Tuesday live from Los Angeles okay so I'm supposed to look for large chibis mm-hmm and I'm supposed to look for Duke Nukem booth dudes yes okay okay so weak so I could can I provide the buzzer if I find the booth dudes yes you can because I have found they hate they usually do have somewhere the scantily clad muscular guys right now the question is are they going to be advertising Duke Nukem we'll find out so get that buzzer ready and yes you I give you full permission to buzz dark soccer if that happens although really like I'm gonna buzz me I'm sure all right yes did you go by telltale smooth all right no it's fine I don't I don't think they have a booth II they I don't think they do it either they do that was they do it packs yeah they do packs but they don't get a booth at e3 and I mean and if there is a king quest thing they'd be should probably shown in Activision's group booth because they own the IP oh that's right it's like a joint thingy so okay well Bobby I will talk to you more on Tuesday have a safe flight tomorrow thank you and no more rule 34 talk come on guys all right we'll try be professional how long have you been let's see this show about seven years all right take care Bobby see ya bye 1 8 7 7 game olr a username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to call and talk more porn time I'm kidding what about more last-minute stories I want them to do an Animal Crossing that actually has a huge world like in the anime because I started watching on a minute so she pretty good Ubisoft not what I'm sorry I see this type of thing I'd usually expect from Ubisoft but here's one of Activision's big announcements that they're gonna be making Activision Publishing and Sega toys they have created wappy dog wappy dog is basically an eyebo ripoff for the Nintendo DS and it will allow you to interact with the robot dog in the game and you will to does wappy dog come with Jack a cat I don't think that's what it sounds like to me wappy dog wappy dog wappy dog and Jackie cat I'm 12 I have problems other ocean interactive they have announced that they're gonna be working on a new project for Xbox Live arcade and PlayStation Network based on the HG Wells novel war of the worlds and of course it's gonna be you know following the events of the 1953 film and include a new story arc characters locations and subplots you know I'd actually be kind of cool to see like something like this like resistance style or something like that it's not as Tom Cruise isn't involved let's go to the let's go to the phones for another call higher on Orange launch radio who's this legends off of here legend of Zaku what's up my friend nothing much just getting ready to know for tomorrow's a case of the Mondays you sit back and watch the press conferences you can have your popcorn yeah I'm gonna be trying to you know browse it from my desk there you go I mean I have two monitors so I could probably pull it off on one of them but going on going on what I was trying to bring up tonight was the whole Call of Duty elite thing which is basically activisions next you know shameless attempted and money-grabbing mmm I'm sensing you're not a fan no I mean I don't understand when other other like when other developers other companies you know like like Bungie and EA have offered these services for free and activisions mostly paywalling the the good stuff like videos I mean it's what I'm sensing is that they are probably going to herald the the next video game crash you think about it and I bring this up because you think about how the first one happened and how this one might might draw parallels to the one half the one in 83 where you have like one we have one particular company just trying to hash out you know multiple just trying to just trying to rehash franchises to the point where quality degrades and you know fans get turned off you know I I don't think another video game crash across the board is possible I think there is possible company failures I don't think forever you're going to have Nintendo Sony Microsoft one of them will fail where you're getting to the point where activisions literally watering down diluting the entire first-person shooter genre like if people for the most you know if for the most part consumers I'm not talking about the hardcore gamers the ones that consistently by Call of Duty you know the ones that basically don't have other first-person shooters lined up aside from aside from like the second Call of Duty Halo gears you know like the small really I'm trying to like put my finger on the demographic but it's the type of person that wouldn't care less about what the scene things in more important you know it's just like instantly gratified by by just explosions so what about what about just like voting with your dollars you know it's a concept we were talking about a lot I understand that it's possible but when you have when you have one company just giving negative connotations to one genre but just like trying to nickel and dime people every step of the way and just trying to like not really innovate then it's gonna be harder for other titles to really stand out unless battlefield 3 manages to pull an upset which I know it will because it has a lot to offer on the table and I think that yeah I don't think it's gonna lead to a crash I think it would just be yeah battlefield 3 might become the new champion you know or maybe I get to the point where video gamers are gonna get sick and tired of actually of having to deal with just mediocrity okay well let me throw this question at you kind of out of left field here because you mentioned Halo is one of the games that you think has done it very well but we know that activism bungee every party for every bunch he was the first was first really to pioneer such a thing where they integrated you know the ability to look up your stats online and post the video straight from the console but I know it has the bungee and Activision are partnering up for whatever this next game at least Activision is publishing it so do you think that the same you know nickel and dime extra stuff I don't really need the thing is gonna continue and now it's under Activision I mean Microsoft didn't do that much didn't even do any of that like I know when you know when bungee was working with Microsoft that never happened because they were trying new ways to engage people into the into that genre and into that game and what better way and then to launch all you know the the whole halo waypoint thing I believe where it allows you to interact you know look up your scores post it on Facebook and so forth but then you know when Activision is thrown into the mix you have a company that's helping on just trying to like monetize and maximize every single every single dollar out of all their their IP to the point where just like they're willing to cut corners and sacrifice quality in the name of the almighty dollar let me ask this question we gotta wrap up and get more calls let me ask this question in on this what do you think they could do to make more money on the franchise that doesn't seem so nickel-and-dime well first of all you shouldn't try to like you shouldn't try to nickel and dime for things that are have been offered for free in the past like that whole call of duty elite that it looks many people just like shrugged it off so far because from what I heard for example on the other sites like a taco for example they basically you know they basically shut they basically wrote it off as just another money grab so they basically they have they really have no hopes for this um for this endeavor they really don't they just like it doesn't faze them it doesn't engage them that well and that's getting a really lukewarm reception right and you know more importantly trying to create innovative ways to re-engage your customers like try not to be hacked the same you know the same boring old five-hour campaign and instead offering new ways to offer balanced gameplay like if they fix up the game playing in multiplayer where it's not a camp fest then they could then they have a better shot we at least have one person agreeing with you in the chat room dark toa gak says Activision is one shit of a company for something for lack of something less constructive to say all right buddy we're gonna let you go so we try to get at least one more call tonight but have a good one all right have a good one later one eight seven seven game olr or a username on skype is orange launch radio we'll try to squeeze in at least one more call if anyone wants to call it's e3 prediction time surely you've got something you want to predict one eight seven seven game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio anything else you want to get out here low-key with last-minute stories yes Microsoft is officially announced what games they're going to be showing at e3 oh this would be in their booth including the third party stuff some of it sounds interesting let's see starting off some of these you probably heard before a Tomb Raider fours of four Star Wars connect Gears of War 3 a halo related title I'm sure that's halo connect codename kingdoms sesame street once upon a monster that's the new fuck was it the new double fine game over they oh yeah Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim steel battalion well well Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim is not supposed to be playable they're gonna show I wonder if maybe it's just a trailer if that would be hot if they're showing that playable on the floor I think it's playable uh let's see here a steel battalion heavy armor Alan Wake night springs which is connect compatible xcom hitman absolution modern warfare 3 spelunky HD ghost recon it's a rail shooter for connect dance central to connect fun labs x commerce connect sports season 2 toys soldier cold war fabled the journey Raving Rabbids for connect another unspecified double fine game hybrid which is an Xbox live arcade shooter roller coaster connect and rise of nightmares for connect hmm so there's some of your announcements for e3 all right let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in here hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this 30 DC DT dark Tetsuya what's on your mind buddy finally coming out hmm what's that Llamulana finally has a Japanese release day of course I should have guessed Llamulana you are in love with this game and what's the Japanese release date Oh God June 21st June 21st hey that's pretty close to my birthday do you think this means we might get a US release around the same time or don't bet on it after e3 yes hopefully maybe it'll be one of the few we titles tucked away on the show floor actually the Nintendo's booth will probably actually have a lot of we title still showing at least whatever they can mostly 3ds though probably oh yeah so we'll see what is it about Llamulana that you just love so damn much it's like well it's like Super Metroid or Symphony of the night you've got this huge world you get to explore and you're running around killing monsters and all that flying hmm like those other games so great you like that whole Metroidvania stuff now there might you might have a hater in chat because Bobby Blackwell is like is that that if this is that Llamulana shit Oh God why do you think people are hating on Llamulana I don't know I mean I know the PC version is kind of kind of hard but I hear they'll be they'll be adjusting that from the PCWare version yes it's got to be a little easier for all those we kiddies it does yeah so e3 is this week besides Llamulana is there anything you're looking forward to hearing about at the show oh Nintendo's new console I'm kind of sure they got going on with that yeah I'm really hoping that they'll announce something that actually will make Loki say wow that looks cool like if that were to actually happen like I just I'd die the show would be done because I would have died I think he just got chased out he didn't know he's talking with Dan they're having boy talk about something Oh boys all right um let's see so what would make you insanely happy if Nintendo announced on their new console like I've talked about I want an f-zero game what game do you want you're excited oh man you don't even know all of it I want them all I want an Animal Crossing porn game on the new cafe that's what I want I'm kidding I'm kidding there you go what an Animal Crossing Llamulana HD an Animal Crossing game with the Nintendo games intact would be awesome and I'm not talking about a new like I'm talking about like a new Animal Crossing game not this like hey look we poured the same damn game over all right all right DT I'm gonna let you go so you can go slap black wolf with the trout in the chat room but thanks for calling and I hope Llamulana comes out soon all right take care actually I'm a little worried because if Llamulana comes out too soon then dar Tetsuya will never finish his series on where are they now that he's doing for the website I don't even know who he's interviewing it's like a secret so he's fine he's found blasts from olr's past to interview on our website throughout the
