00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:24,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, June 5th, 2011, the E3 rumors start to roll in a day before the first press conference, the track listing for the Play for Japan benefit album is unveiled, and soon you can raise pets in The Sims 3.

2
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:37,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:46,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about video games over the next three hours or so, and you can join us if you're listening to us live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

4
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:52,085
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

5
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,387
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-host.

6
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:59,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to the one, the only, the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:59,589 --> 00:00:59,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

8
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:00,149
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

9
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:05,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm recovering from my party it's your party and you'll cry if you want to

10
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:07,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I cried when everyone left.

11
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:09,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, they're gone.

12
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:10,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it wasn't your birthday.

13
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:11,874
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't a birthday party.

14
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:12,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was the party?

15
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:19,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for me getting two associate's degrees after 15 years of going to college.

16
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a professional student.

17
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:24,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I've changed my major so many times is the problem.

18
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:27,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my art and media, which is basically graphic design.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I have liberal arts.

20
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:32,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next spring I'll have social sciences.

21
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:34,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You just like to learn.

22
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:57,607
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

24
00:01:58,107 --> 00:02:00,968
[SPEAKER_05]: The voice over there, of course, the one and the only Tech Master, Loki.

25
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,508
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

26
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:02,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,089
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

28
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:07,990
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we were off last week, so it's a little interesting to be back here after two weeks.

29
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hope you all had a good Memorial Day weekend.

30
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you guys did.

31
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Disneyland.

32
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

33
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: But what else is new here at Orange Lounge Radio?

34
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:15,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

35
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ever travel anywhere else.

36
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:17,773
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

37
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:18,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going again.

38
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and I'm going again this weekend.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get into more of that later on because it's kind of sick.

40
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:25,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Loki, what have you been up to?

41
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:26,295
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you do with your days off?

42
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:28,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

43
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:31,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not sleeping.

44
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:33,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that time, huh?

45
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:35,418
[SPEAKER_04]: We mean it's that time.

46
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:39,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been that time for 10 months.

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought he was sleeping through the night.

48
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:41,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's not anymore?

49
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:47,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he sleeps through the night, but he also wakes up about eight times during the night.

50
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:48,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

51
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:48,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

52
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:55,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, of course, if you are new to Orange Lawns Radio, Loki and the Mrs. gave birth to Josh, what, about nine months ago?

53
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten months ago.

54
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,770
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't give birth to him.

55
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what I mean.

56
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:00,832
[SPEAKER_05]: He was there when it happened.

57
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:03,935
[SPEAKER_11]: But he did not go through labor.

58
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:07,357
[SPEAKER_05]: He made a very important contribution to the whole process.

59
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:09,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but the woman does all the work.

60
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:11,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

61
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:12,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

62
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You and your women's lib.

63
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:13,748
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

64
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop burning your bra here on this show.

65
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even wearing one.

66
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:19,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, bleh.

67
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:19,835
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

68
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:21,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

69
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in my pajamas for tonight's show.

70
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:27,764
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatters in chat.orangelaunchradio.com are like, oh yeah, prove it.

71
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:28,746
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

72
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:29,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I will.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Here comes Dan, who's on mic.

74
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:35,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

75
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,147
[SPEAKER_05]: What did he say?

76
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:36,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even catch it.

77
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear what he said either.

78
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Something blah blah irrational psycho.

79
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:40,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I picked up.

80
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,759
[SPEAKER_02]: He just needs to shut up forever.

81
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: That was enough for me.

82
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:43,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

83
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,212
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

84
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:09,610
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're doing shows Tuesday and Wednesday this next week.

85
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,112
[SPEAKER_05]: They are live E3 specials, different place.

86
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,954
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be at allgames.com because there's other stuff going on.

87
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:21,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also wanted to help you guys learn about our brand new Ustream channel is now up and running.

88
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:23,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username there is Orange Lounge.

89
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,960
[SPEAKER_05]: More information will be available at orangelounge.com later this week.

90
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And best of all, our good buddy, Bobby Blackwolf.

91
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: who does the show before us here at All Games Radio will be joining us over the Tuesday and Wednesday nights to be talking about what he's observing at the show floor what's going on behind the scenes at the press conferences what Sony is filling five and a half hours with pray tell tomorrow night

92
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:48,037
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Miklatov is also going to be joining us.

93
00:04:48,077 --> 00:05:02,030
[SPEAKER_05]: They're both going to Nintendo's press thing and will get to fill us in on what it was like to play whatever Nintendo's calling their new system without a three and a half hour wait or whatever long that line is going to be at E3 which I am looking forward to not standing in.

94
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very strange because it's not like I haven't been to E3 before.

95
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't go during the airport years but

96
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be interesting doing coverage from this end of things.

97
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:24,349
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm happy that we'll be able to produce something a lot more slick, where we'll be able to take your calls, have the live chat room, which will still be in the same place, chat.orangelandre.com, and let you guys interact with the E3 coverage.

98
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:33,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, give your feedback, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, and we'll be voices here in the studio, voices on the E3 show floor, and your voices out there all over the internet.

99
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:35,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, I've got to wait until Tuesday.

100
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,919
[SPEAKER_05]: For Nintendo, yeah.

101
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you guys know how it's all going down, tomorrow there is no Expo.

102
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,101
[SPEAKER_05]: The Expo floor is not open, but the E3 show kind of starts because that's when the press conferences start.

103
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:54,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft kicks it off in the morning, then Sony's going to be in the evening, scrunched in there, Ubisoft and EA.

104
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:59,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami already happened, which we'll be getting to a little later, so we'll talk about what they talked about.

105
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:00,844
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not doing their own conference.

106
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:06,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I noticed left out Activision, unless I just completely overlooked it, which is possible.

107
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure somebody in the chat room will jump in with that if I miss it.

108
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: They also tend to usually have a lot of announcements, like Call of Duty will usually be shown at Sony or Microsoft's conference.

109
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, whoa, I've never seen that before on these consoles.

110
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:31,271
[SPEAKER_05]: My thought, too, is that Activision kind of really blew their load last year with that whole Eminem, Rihanna, all those celebs they paraded out on stage for DJ Hero 2, which then, well, you know, it didn't end up doing so hot.

111
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it was a fine game.

112
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:34,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoyed DJ Hero 2.

113
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was asking because my boss is going.

114
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:45,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, my boss and our vice president of sales, the guy doesn't know anything about gaming, so he's going to E3.

115
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:46,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

116
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so they're going, so you guys going to any of the parties or anything while you're there?

117
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:59,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, it's not anything like when they had the DJ Hero 2 thing where they had people DJing and Eminem and stuff like that.

118
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:04,848
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having, I don't remember which publisher it is, but someone's having a bowling night.

119
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice.

120
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf, our good pal, is in our chat room saying Activision has a booth, but they don't have a concert.

121
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:17,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is, yeah, whatever their big announcement is might be at one of the other press conferences.

122
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:18,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're right on with that.

123
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,414
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have really any big announcements.

124
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:21,635
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bungie thing, right?

125
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:22,715
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got to be this year.

126
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,936
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got to give us more details on the Bungie thing.

127
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:32,958
[SPEAKER_04]: All they've got coming out... They've announced everything up through the third quarter as of last week.

128
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:36,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So they haven't announced their fourth quarter stuff other than Call of Duty.

129
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,340
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's not a lot that they can really cram in there.

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually there's a Guitar Hero game around that time.

131
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:50,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've got the X-Men game, they've got the new Spider-Man game...

132
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a crappy Spyro game that has some stupid little toy thing that you gotta scan your toy in order to play the character in the game.

133
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course they've also got...

134
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:11,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they might be blowing a big announcement about Diablo before a BlizzCon.

135
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:14,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard's all their own thing.

136
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,937
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to announce any of that.

137
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:21,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision has been the one calling the shots for a little while, which is why some of us WoW advocates think the game's gone.

138
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Little bit south the past couple of years.

139
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:29,768
[SPEAKER_04]: They may announce a console port because there's already rumors that they hired people to port over the PlayStation 3.

140
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:35,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think that's exactly what the announcement is going to be, but we'll get into that later when we get into E3 predictions a little later on.

141
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:35,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

142
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

143
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:40,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try, actually, we're going to go... I'm...

144
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,461
[SPEAKER_05]: This is definitely live radio here.

145
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have a man on the ground already in L.A.

146
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,463
[SPEAKER_05]: who's also going to be joining us on the Tuesday-Wednesday shows.

147
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:53,324
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually going to give him a call right now, live, unscripted.

148
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:56,885
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually at some type of event already, and I want to get more details on that.

149
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:58,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's already been by the convention center.

150
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:04,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to give our old buddy Miklatov a call and see what's up in L.A.

151
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:04,827
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.

152
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:08,668
[SPEAKER_05]: This may be botched a little bit.

153
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,229
[SPEAKER_05]: He's at some event, and I'll get some more details on what's going on.

154
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be very noisy.

155
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So, one ringy dingy, two ringy dingys.

156
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

157
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Miklatov!

158
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up?

159
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:19,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, not much.

160
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rob, of course, Orange Launch Radio.

161
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that because I've been text messaging you.

162
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:23,523
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

163
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:23,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you at?

164
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:24,424
[SPEAKER_05]: You're at an event.

165
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:24,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

166
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:25,966
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be crazy.

167
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The E3 parties have already started.

168
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:27,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

169
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is the... What is this I'm at?

170
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:33,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Where am I at right now?

171
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:35,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky Strike.

172
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:39,057
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for Major Nelson's Twitter.

173
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:39,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

174
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:54,319
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a huge meetup where they're giving away food and drinks and free bowling and most importantly passes to the presser event tomorrow

175
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:00,554
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not it.

176
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone else is actually doing the bowling alley.

177
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Here at the bowling alley, it's just some colored balloons.

178
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,119
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually went into the E3 Expo Hall.

179
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

180
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Breaking, put that on Twitter, everybody.

181
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:32,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Breaking, Microsoft unveils colored balloons at E3.

182
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a brand new thing for the Kinect.

183
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, this is almost as good as the spacesuits last year.

184
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:39,822
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that last year?

185
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:44,465
[SPEAKER_07]: They are green and white, and I guess that's purple for Kinect.

186
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:47,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Breaking, Breaking, Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.

187
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:49,089
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an exclusive report.

188
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you're saying, but they're about to get more tickets away, so I'm going to hang up on you.

189
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:53,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Goodbye.

190
00:10:57,065 --> 00:11:08,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's exactly what it's going to sound like Tuesday and Wednesday as well, is that we'll get the nice professional radio call from Bobby Blackwolf, and then when he decides he's got to hang up to go to a swanky party, then Miklatov's going to call us.

191
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:10,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know what really happened today, but I saw some balloons.

192
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Ponchos Space Ponchos

193
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,232
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

194
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a crapload of rock band last night.

195
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Rock Band 3 and Beatles Rock Band going on last night.

196
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:50,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sang a lot and my throat hurts.

197
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't lost my voice.

198
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,961
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you sing?

199
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:54,082
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your specialties?

200
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:58,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have the song that apparently everyone says I'm really good at.

201
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:04,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was singing My Chemical Romance and...

202
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:07,276
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I do?

203
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine in the Afternoon, Panic at the Disco, which is one of my favorite songs.

204
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I did some Kansas.

205
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:21,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Any chance we could get you to hum a few bars?

206
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:22,926
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

207
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:32,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I sang just about everything that we did in Beatles Rock Band, except for three that Junami sang.

208
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:34,533
[SPEAKER_02]: He was at the party, too.

209
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:37,173
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a blast from the past.

210
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:38,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Intern Drew, good job.

211
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:48,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also played WoW, which I did today, and yelled at the ship for not arriving on time, or at least on time in my universe.

212
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to share this.

213
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:51,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikulatov just texted me.

214
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:53,326
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, you can call me back.

215
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It was too loud to hear the numbers.

216
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I will call when you have something news besides colored balloons.

217
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:01,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't judge.

218
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:03,995
[SPEAKER_05]: They're green and white.

219
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:05,814
[SPEAKER_05]: No shit.

220
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:06,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Xbox.

221
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan's been playing L.A.

222
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:09,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire.

223
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've beat Portal 2 now for like the ninth time.

224
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm on my tenth playthrough.

225
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:16,779
[SPEAKER_02]: On single player mode.

226
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find something new every time.

227
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

228
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But I finally got the Smash TV achievement, Rob.

229
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:25,682
[SPEAKER_11]: That was hard.

230
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:40,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all the other ones are easy except for the last one you have to get, which is the room where... It's like you go in and there's a glass to your right and then there's three turrets.

231
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:43,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And the button you need to press is in front of the turrets on the other side of the glass.

232
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to go across and send the little...

233
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's how you get the last one.

234
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:13,650
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

235
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,478
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anything else for your gaming week?

236
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:37,519
[SPEAKER_05]: We had pie.

237
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

238
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:40,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange sickle cupcakes.

239
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:41,882
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was all right.

240
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:43,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play a whole lot.

241
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:48,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Portal through a little bit again, cheating all the way this time, which is fun.

242
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mainly just the kill time.

243
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really want to play anything else.

244
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Played more Grand Theft Auto, as usual, and...

245
00:14:58,493 --> 00:14:59,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

246
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a tiny little bit of L.A.

247
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

248
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:09,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't really get a whole lot of time to play it, but I made it through the first kind of case that you have there.

249
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:11,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

250
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:14,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the game's really detailed, but I don't know.

251
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:15,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably get into it.

252
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:17,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to have some time to play it.

253
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

254
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

255
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like you had a pretty quick week for games.

256
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:33,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I'm still working on Grand Theft Auto mods and a whole bunch of other garbage.

257
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:37,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that you're kind of looking forward to with the next week?

258
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Any demos that might hit the store that you're like, ooh, I gotta play that?

259
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:45,409
[SPEAKER_04]: No, oh, by the way, my dev console got banned from PartnerNet, which is kind of disappointing.

260
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:45,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

261
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,450
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that happen?

262
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,110
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you get caught?

263
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,011
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it's just they eventually banned all of them, you know, after a while.

264
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:53,391
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't matter.

265
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:55,772
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't really anything on PartnerNet that I wanted to play.

266
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all Xbox Live Arcade games.

267
00:15:57,852 --> 00:16:00,693
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, like, you know, betas for, you know...

268
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:01,213
[SPEAKER_04]: JTagConsole

269
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:23,860
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting better about hiding that stuff.

270
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:25,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, whatever.

271
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really even care.

272
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:35,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if there's anything like last year, like almost all the trailers that will be at the press conference tomorrow, you will see then show up on Xbox to download.

273
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, see it in glorious HD.

274
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even worried about playing demos for stuff.

275
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:44,626
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some games that look really awesome.

276
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:49,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row 3 I was pretty excited for from the get-go because I love Saints Row.

277
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:59,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It kept the fun aspect and the really over-the-top part of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and they just keep building upon it.

278
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,361
[SPEAKER_04]: The first game was sort of a Grand Theft Auto rip-off, but it's really become kind of its own thing.

279
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love just the whole game.

280
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really fun.

281
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:14,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new one that they have coming out this fall just looks amazing.

282
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:15,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I can't wait to play it.

283
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:20,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they do announce a new Grand Theft Auto game, I love both games.

284
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Both series I think can coexist because...

285
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just kind of different I am very disappointed though that the third doesn't have online multiplayer as far as like death matches and stuff goes because I mean I don't know the first first game was kind of it wasn't very good as far as what they had online and the second game they tried to mix it up a little bit but it was really wacky the way they had everything they really should just stuck with you know kind of doing a Grand Theft Auto style where it's okay here's a portion of the map and you play in and go you know something simple like that

286
00:17:53,087 --> 00:18:03,515
[SPEAKER_04]: but they tried to do some funky stuff with it and it was alright but the maps they had were really kind of limited and the fun was kind of limited too but at least they have online co-op for two players this time

287
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:10,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go to our chatroom at chat.orangelondradio.com and I think Breakman's pretty much echoing something you just said here.

288
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Saints Row 3 doesn't have any multiplayer versus though.

289
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:12,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Frown?

290
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just two-player online co-op like the second game.

291
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:20,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is fun, you know, because I have Grand Theft Auto, so... Co-op can be fun.

292
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, co-op is fun.

293
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:30,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually a lot of fun playing System Link co-op with the second Saints Row game, so I'm looking forward to this new one for sure.

294
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:32,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you know,

295
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:40,804
[SPEAKER_04]: and right now I'm still playing lots of Grand Theft Auto but that's going to interrupt or something's going to interrupt that though come July.

296
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:41,824
[SPEAKER_04]: July.

297
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:47,747
[SPEAKER_04]: July 5th to be exact is when we get the new Earth Defense Force game.

298
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be awesome.

299
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:51,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Counting down the days.

300
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:51,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

301
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:52,870
[SPEAKER_05]: DUNGEON SIEGE 3 DUNGEON SIEGE 3

302
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought the first two games, you know, they made their point.

303
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,248
[SPEAKER_05]: They had their relevance.

304
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:13,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they were PC-only titles.

305
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:22,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But now Square Enix is behind the publishing of this third game that's happening now on the consoles and, I believe, PCs later on.

306
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So the demo's available on Xbox Live.

307
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:24,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the same time.

308
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:25,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

309
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:26,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the same time.

310
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:26,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all the same time.

311
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So the demo's now available on Xbox Live, and it's very Diablo-esque.

312
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:32,455
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never played Dungeons & Dragons, it's very Diablo.

313
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of Microsoft's answer to Diablo in some ways.

314
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the game's very Diablo-esque.

315
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:37,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was okay.

316
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:51,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time playing it, but I thought, especially following up a game like Torchlight, it was nice to see the more robust graphics and that Square Enix Cinema presentation style.

317
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it something I'm excited to spend $60 on?

318
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:59,204
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not based off the demo, but will I rent it or get it in a bargain bin?

319
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, absolutely.

320
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:04,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very challenging position we're in right now in the gaming industry.

321
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be interesting to see what develops with this E3.

322
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games you are expected to pay $60 for.

323
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games, like Angry Birds, you're expected to pay $1 for or even get free.

324
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really about trying to find that happy price point.

325
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:20,413
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about a new Nintendo console coming out at E3.

326
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:21,794
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the games going to cost?

327
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Nintendo now going to up the bar to $60?

328
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Although some would argue they have been already.

329
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:28,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I don't doubt.

330
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:31,039
[SPEAKER_05]: But are the games going to be worth it?

331
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:37,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a certain point where the consumer goes, hmm, do I really buy this at $60 or do I just wait until it comes down in price?

332
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:39,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

333
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tricky... NGP games are $50.

334
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:42,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

335
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:43,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

336
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:44,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But PSP games were $50.

337
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:49,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not a lot of PSP games were $50, but there were a few.

338
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:49,811
[SPEAKER_04]: The big ones.

339
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But like $40 is kind of the price point for the PSP.

340
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:55,755
[SPEAKER_04]: But they did have $50 games.

341
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I really want to say about the demo.

342
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:00,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool.

343
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Fable 3 I got to play, which this game's what, like a year and a half old?

344
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bet a lot of you that were interested in this have probably already played it, but I was a little late to the party.

345
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:09,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the game.

346
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:10,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

347
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,145
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of concepts in Fable I really like.

348
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:16,527
[SPEAKER_05]: But I sometimes wonder if this game tries to do too much.

349
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:19,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And at its core, it's really repetitive.

350
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:22,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like a Facebook game.

351
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Repetitive.

352
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

353
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:40,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the fact that you do these quests to enhance relationship with villagers and I like this whole way that the villager enhancement thing is built in but when you're doing the same fetch quest or the same delivery quest multiple times you're like okay so what am I doing here?

354
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:51,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like it's just very very repetitive I cannot trust anything Peter Molyneux says anymore I mean seriously all of his innovative stuff is such bullshit because it's just like

355
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I added a dog to my game.

356
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,319
[SPEAKER_04]: No other game has had dogs in it before.

357
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
[SPEAKER_04]: This dog you'll love.

358
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,401
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't give a shit about the dog.

359
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the dog was cool, but you know what?

360
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:04,704
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog was as cool as any other dog in any other game.

361
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:07,026
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog was actually kind of stupid sometimes.

362
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:12,336
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest crime for me that Fable 3 made, I don't feel it took the series forward.

363
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:13,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel it took it back.

364
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Fable 2 was a much better game.

365
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:19,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it had that whole good and evil thing developed.

366
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Fable 3, I don't even notice it.

367
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,919
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't even seem like that exists in it.

368
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more about this whole path to being a king.

369
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more politics.

370
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a very repetitive...

371
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really into it for about an hour and a half and then I got bored of it.

372
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I got really bored of it and I was like, you know what, I'm done.

373
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to play anymore Fable 3.

374
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:45,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad saying it because there's a lot that I like about the Fable series and I really liked Fable 2.

375
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Fable 3 was rushed, to be honest.

376
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they needed to wait another year to put this game out.

377
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:51,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving it back.

378
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's interesting.

379
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:12,672
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

380
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:12,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

381
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:58,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Katsune in our chatroom says I got really bored with it quickly as well yeah I mean it's just and and the whole I know y'all love this term microtransactions for like outfits and weapons and stuff no that was an obvious bad that was just microtransactions gone bad I would I would never drop a penny on any of it period

382
00:23:59,125 --> 00:23:59,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

383
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:09,370
[SPEAKER_05]: The other game I played this week, I got to watch Alan play the Duke Nukem Forever demo, which hit Steam over the weekend.

384
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to admit, I like its very tongue-in-cheek.

385
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:18,635
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not make any pauses about where exactly this game comes from.

386
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:22,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen, Loki, the opening sequence to Duke Nukem Forever in the demo?

387
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:23,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

388
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:52,891
[SPEAKER_05]: and I love that it starts in the whole football scene which is very reminiscent of the end of the last game which was in the football stadium but then it and this is a little bit spoilery but deal with it it's the first five minutes of the game it pans out of the football field or whatever and you see that Duke is actually playing the video game and it pans out so far that you see these two girls are actually giving him a blowjob while he's playing the game they are the Molson twins by the way the Molson twins yeah

389
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're like, oh, was that good for you?

390
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Wholesome Twins or something like that.

391
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the Wholesome Twins.

392
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:03,495
[SPEAKER_05]: They go something like, oh, was the game good, Duke?

393
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he goes, yeah, well, after 12 fucking years, it better be.

394
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:11,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like that it made no pauses about that.

395
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:16,060
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when Alan got into the actual game, all I heard was,

396
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,321
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard.

397
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:18,362
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bullshit.

398
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:19,142
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard.

399
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:20,163
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is hard.

400
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:20,583
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard.

401
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:21,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate this game.

402
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:22,185
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bullshit.

403
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:23,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently it's really cheap.

404
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Why doesn't he just play it on an easier setting?

405
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:28,029
[SPEAKER_05]: He is playing it on like easiest.

406
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Why doesn't he just get better at games then?

407
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him he needs to go back and play Duke Nukem 3D.

408
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:36,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could go back and play Duke Nukem 3D.

409
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,218
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's my thing.

410
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:41,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really accurately judge Duke Nukem forever until I play multiplayer.

411
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:45,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's where everything Duke Nukem... I mean, fuck single player in that game.

412
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:46,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

413
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:46,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not...

414
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:53,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, after level 1-1 where you teehee, you have the stripper and everything, it's forgettable.

415
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:55,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually really did like the single player.

416
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:56,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But the multiplayer is awesome.

417
00:25:56,774 --> 00:25:58,415
[SPEAKER_04]: The single player levels were pretty awesome.

418
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I even liked the Atomic Edition with all the extra stuff that they added in there.

419
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I loved the level that was basically Disneyland, which is pretty awesome.

420
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved the one that was in a supermarket.

421
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:10,243
[SPEAKER_04]: They had one at a post office and stuff like that.

422
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:11,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, those were kind of cool to me.

423
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:14,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of feel like I should just go back and play Duke Nukem 3D.

424
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but see, though, we tried that, though, on Remember the 360.

425
00:26:18,903 --> 00:26:21,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We all downloaded and got all excited, and it kind of sucked.

426
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:24,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop is yelling at me in the chat room.

427
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Lies and slander.

428
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:26,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Lies and slander.

429
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:31,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it sounded like to me.

430
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:31,713
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

431
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:36,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.

432
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:37,418
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

433
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he on Skype?

434
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I could call him to defend himself.

435
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:43,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it.

436
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:44,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

437
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:47,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, I'll look up his number.

438
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that sad?

439
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know his number because we live in such a cell phone age that I don't need it.

440
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to call him and see what happens.

441
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:56,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I know my husband's number.

442
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:06,722
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just the night of random outbound phone calls, is what it is.

443
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:07,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's call my mother next.

444
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:10,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have sent my mother to E3.

445
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that have been fun?

446
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:12,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

447
00:27:15,188 --> 00:27:15,989
[SPEAKER_04]: She wouldn't be able to get in.

448
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Pick up the phone.

449
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:23,154
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to be all, what's this number?

450
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:24,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And send it to voicemail.

451
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:30,456
[SPEAKER_05]: He's screaming no in the chat room.

452
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:33,477
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not answering.

453
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:37,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to voicemail.

454
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:37,798
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

455
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:39,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio.

456
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,799
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, my phone is in the other room.

457
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's running to find it.

458
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:48,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try one more time.

459
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,516
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time.

460
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:56,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody in the chat room is yelling at him.

461
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,261
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best radio ever.

462
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,944
[SPEAKER_02]: This is even funnier than Shermie saying bless you when someone says this.

463
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:04,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently he was playing it on medium and I misunderstood that.

464
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:05,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

465
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:07,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, lies and slander.

466
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to turn the radio down or else we're going to have a really bad echo.

467
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:12,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're fine.

468
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

469
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:13,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hi.

470
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:17,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, tonight's the night of random phone calls where I call people.

471
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:19,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Chatters, you don't notice.

472
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:23,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you tell me about the Duke Nukem demo since I clearly misunderstood.

473
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:40,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you get to the second part of the demo where it shows you some vehicle play which is fun and then you get out of your truck and the background is brown and the enemies are brown so when they pop out I actually had a hard time

474
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:46,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And because I was playing it on medium difficulty, by the time I could get behind cover, I was dead already.

475
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:52,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So I switched it to easy and then learned where the spawns were and then switched back to medium and I was fine.

476
00:28:53,029 --> 00:29:00,193
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I think there's some work that needs to be done on the clarity of the mobs, especially since they don't.

477
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:04,329
[SPEAKER_08]: They all kind of jumped out from behind things from out of nowhere.

478
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the game's gone gold now, so whoops.

479
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they're going to fix that.

480
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

481
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:13,851
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like Duke.

482
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:16,332
[SPEAKER_08]: They definitely captured the humor and the attitude.

483
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:24,854
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as some amazing first-person shooter like Bioshock, which was a completely different experience, I don't think there's anything that remarkable about it.

484
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:39,824
[SPEAKER_08]: it's pretty much all fan service the fact that it exists means that it's going to sell but I don't think it's all that super amazing from the demo so do you think you'll invest 50 bucks or whatever in the full version on Steam?

485
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:53,247
[SPEAKER_08]: hell no I don't care that badly that's really kind of offensive I mean obviously it's a dude bro game with the blowjob in the opening scene does the demo have multiplayer?

486
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so

487
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:56,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

488
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad.

489
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:57,810
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

490
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:58,751
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

491
00:29:58,791 --> 00:29:59,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for letting me bug you.

492
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:00,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be mad.

493
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:01,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

494
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:04,855
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted you to be able to accurately represent and defend yourself.

495
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never want to misstate your opinions.

496
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:07,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

497
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:07,777
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

498
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:08,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

499
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:08,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

500
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:08,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

501
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:09,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

502
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Who should we call next?

503
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,080
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

504
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:13,761
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

505
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:14,741
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the rest of the show to do.

506
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

507
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,242
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to get into news.

508
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:17,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for our Gaming Weeks.

509
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:18,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick housekeeping.

510
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I just want to clarify the schedule.

511
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,347
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no OLR next Sunday.

512
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:26,329
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be two episodes of OLR on the feed this week.

513
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:27,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday night, Wednesday night.

514
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:34,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us on our new Ustream channel, 7 o'clock Pacific, with special correspondent Bobby Blackwolf.

515
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the great news.

516
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:40,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this really affects anyone listening to this show, but he's also going to be posting the shows on his feed, which I think is really cool.

517
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way if you, I don't know why you would be listening right now and you're not subscribed to our show, but okay, let's say you're not.

518
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:48,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also get them from Bobby's feed.

519
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:50,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to be in both places.

520
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:52,906
[SPEAKER_05]: for maximum exposure.

521
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:58,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting tweeted pictures, by the way, right now from Miklatov, who I guess went to the convention center earlier.

522
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess, you know, a couple days before the show, you can just kind of walk right on in there and walk around.

523
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:10,110
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not in the actual exhibition halls, but let's see, there's a giant ad for Assassin's Creed Revelations.

524
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Giant ad for that.

525
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,332
[SPEAKER_05]: A little picture of the lobby that shows nothing really notable.

526
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:19,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't really see in the room there and they won't let him up the stairs, I'm sure.

527
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:39,961
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it looks like what they're advertising on the entryway is Rage which is supposed to be that big new shooter which is going to have a whole new engine that people are going to adapt kind of like what Unreal brought to the table and there's these little gross little aliens crawling all over the entry plaza for Rage so you can expect that that game is going to have a big presence in E3

528
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:42,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

529
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: No OLR next Sunday because DarkSakura and I will be at Disneyland with Bobby.

530
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:50,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually we won't be there Sunday but we'll be driving back.

531
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,334
[SPEAKER_10]: And there will be a Dan.

532
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:53,792
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a Dan.

533
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:54,633
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a Dan.

534
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:57,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan will be here for the Tuesday-Wednesday shows, too.

535
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:57,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

536
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Loki, unfortunately, will only be able to join us by phone.

537
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see what I can do.

538
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:03,879
[SPEAKER_05]: He might try to pull some strings and join us live.

539
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:04,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.

540
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:05,540
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

541
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:07,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call me.

542
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:10,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it over Skype or something like that.

543
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:12,324
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

544
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:13,425
[SPEAKER_04]: From 8 o'clock on.

545
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:16,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We need at least the Nintendo Press Conference feedback.

546
00:32:16,347 --> 00:32:18,188
[SPEAKER_05]: That's everybody wants out of Loki.

547
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:18,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

548
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:21,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Wednesday, maybe not Wednesday, but...

549
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday would be fun because then that would be after all the press conferences.

550
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:25,433
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

551
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:26,634
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

552
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:30,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on with gaming news because we've got a lot to cover tonight.

553
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:34,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just E3, but of course, of course, E3 rumors are going to start it.

554
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

555
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:35,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what everybody's talking about.

556
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start us off, Loki.

557
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:39,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I don't know.

558
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:40,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

559
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:42,408
[SPEAKER_04]: VitaPita

560
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and so, well, here's what evidence they have for that.

561
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:22,403
[SPEAKER_04]: One, there was a leaked or apparently leaked picture of a brochure showing the system with the PS Vita image on there.

562
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, whereas most people might say, oh, that might be Photoshopped.

563
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's at least some other evidence to go along with that.

564
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:33,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's actually a few pictures of that, so that's kind of interesting.

565
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:46,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, apparently, there was a domain for developers that actually had a PS Vita for it.

566
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:48,765
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Sony dev site.

567
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,286
[SPEAKER_04]: They had that.

568
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:59,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, apparently, there's text for the PlayStation Vita website.

569
00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:04,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Hidden away in the code for the E3 site for Sony.

570
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:07,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say that that's probably true.

571
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's hidden away in their code on their website, and it's also on their dev site, and it's also in this brochure, it's probably... Makes me feel great about the security of Sony in the future, by the way.

572
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: um I also agree it's it's probably the right name it makes sense uh it's you know they're trying to go for that catchy thing uh also just the fact that do you guys remember last E3 everything got spoiled everything no or was it two years ago

573
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:38,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, spoiled by them.

574
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember with the PSP Go?

575
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:42,877
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not just that.

576
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:46,258
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one year where every big announcement that they were going to make was spoiled.

577
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:58,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember he got up on stage and when he showed the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV, it must have been two years ago, he got up on stage and showed the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV and everybody thought he had fucked up and meant to say XIII too, but no, it was actually XIV.

578
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:02,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he goes, hey, there's one we kept from you.

579
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that vividly in my mind.

580
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:06,985
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of that press conference had been spoiled.

581
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, glad you kept that one from us.

582
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:13,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We wish you had kept it away from us forever.

583
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:15,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to keep it a little bit longer.

584
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:20,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other cool information regarding the NGP, or Vita, I guess we'll call it Vita.

585
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:26,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fully backwards compatible with all PSP games that are on the PlayStation Network.

586
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, it's not going to have a UMD drive.

587
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It will also offer smoothing and dual analog support.

588
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:34,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, you know, games like

589
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:50,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Resistance Retribution, how they had the DualShock 3 controller support if you played that with the PSP Go or I believe through the Resistance... I forget what they called that.

590
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Duel Shock 3 Support

591
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:20,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm sorry, I'm late to the party and that's fine, I'm actually waiting to hear a lot of this from Sony's mouth tomorrow, but, um, this thing doesn't have a UMD drive?

592
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:21,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have any?

593
00:36:21,756 --> 00:36:22,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have any drive.

594
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:28,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It has two physical, like, SD cards, proprietary, some sort of storage card.

595
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:34,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, so there's some, I was like, they didn't learn from the go that people don't want to download anything?

596
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:36,785
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like a cartridge, some sort of storage card.

597
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah the rumor was that there was no onboard storage at all for this thing you have to buy your own like memory cards or something like that but that each game would have its own you know card and there'd be space on there for download content and whatnot TigerClaw in our chatroom says they should have called it PS Vivo which is Spanish for live

598
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:57,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be an okay name.

599
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be PSV is what's going to end up happening.

600
00:37:01,662 --> 00:37:07,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, PSV, and I think it's Vita for this is vital for you to have because it has everything.

601
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's Sony's little tagline, it only does everything.

602
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:13,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be fair, it was the strength of the PSP.

603
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,149
[SPEAKER_11]: It did online.

604
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like they have the Vio.

605
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would believe Vita.

606
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's vital.

607
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It's vital for all gamers to have this.

608
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:25,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sticking with Verklent.

609
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's how anyone who buys one will feel.

610
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:35,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, they've been on the record saying that they've learned from their mistakes with the PSP.

611
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to make sure they don't make them again with the Vita.

612
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,961
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically saying, we wanted to...

613
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:52,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Our biggest mistake, I would say, with the PSP was that we were just so happy to provide the PS2 gaming on the go that we kind of stopped there.

614
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:55,906
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we want to do with the NGP, or Vita.

615
00:37:56,706 --> 00:38:03,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides the great graphics and CPU, think on what the interface could put in to make gameplay reality stand out.

616
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Really stand out.

617
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,591
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, something that you cannot even do on the PS3.

618
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:15,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that makes sense with the rear touch and the augmented reality stuff and touchscreen and all that stuff.

619
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:18,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's almost too much.

620
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:23,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some games that are kind of showing off that rear touch thing.

621
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:25,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

622
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little weird to me, but we'll see.

623
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:38,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gotta be honest, you know, I was kind of, you know, I'm the one to kind of buy every console when it comes out and stuff, but, you know, I'm probably actually not gonna buy one of these.

624
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:42,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why is they were showing off some of the games that they have at launch or whatever.

625
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,313
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a Wipeout game, and they have... Of course, Ridge Racer.

626
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,054
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Uncharted, no Ridge Racer.

627
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:49,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet.

628
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And some other games like Super Stardust and stuff like that, but...

629
00:38:54,002 --> 00:38:55,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a fan of Uncharted.

630
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care about Wipeout.

631
00:38:56,965 --> 00:39:02,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, it's almost like, hey, look, it's the 3DS lineup again.

632
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,352
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not going to do this.

633
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:05,733
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not a fan of Uncharted.

634
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:06,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Blasphemer.

635
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:07,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

636
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:10,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to look at the chat room here with some of the comments about the name.

637
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:17,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Jvmon in our chat room says, Vita equals life, PlayStation life, like you live a PlayStation life.

638
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:18,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

639
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:19,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, We knew that joke was coming.

640
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:37,152
[SPEAKER_05]: FusionVault and FusionSentiment

641
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:10,479
[SPEAKER_05]: They are specified in the little trademark as entertainment services, namely providing an online computer game.

642
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:16,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So there must be some type of Fusion series coming out for either Xbox Live Arcade.

643
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,864
[SPEAKER_04]: God, it better not be Fusion Frenzy.

644
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:19,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate Fusion Frenzy.

645
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:20,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not Fusion Frenzy.

646
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:21,166
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a Hudson thing anyway.

647
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It was never Microsoft-centric.

648
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:27,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they couldn't swap developers on Microsoft games.

649
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:35,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but like, if Microsoft was gonna buy a franchise like Fusion Frenzy, which I don't think, I mean, I realize Hudson in the U.S.

650
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:42,339
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of closed, but I believe they still have a Japanese presence, so... Well, just because they... Why would you buy the Fusion Frenzy series?

651
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:43,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That last game was awful!

652
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, you know, it's like Hudson was responsible for the Mario Party games, and those weren't terrible.

653
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:54,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, for the 360, like, ahhh, or even the original Xbox...

654
00:40:55,326 --> 00:41:11,324
[SPEAKER_05]: and let's just not give a shit on this problem with all due respect to people that work at Hudson the biggest issue with Hudson is that they've had some really big hits and some huge misses like just wow wow like Bomberman Zero was a Hudson game if I'm not mistaken correct

655
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:36,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Fusion Frenzy 2 I think all Bomberman games have been Hudson Because Hudson created Bomberman Correct But when they hit, they hit pretty well DECA Sports actually wasn't a bad game It was a nice little expansion of Wii Sports The Bomberman Xbox Live Arcade thing was great It delivered exactly what people wanted out of a Bomberman game

656
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:39,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, how did we get from Fusion to Bomberman?

657
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that stinking Fusion frenzy.

658
00:41:42,077 --> 00:41:43,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know what the problem with Hudson is?

659
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: They're owned by Konami.

660
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it's not their answer to pixel junk.

661
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:48,904
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where my mind goes.

662
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be like they're gonna go- Why do they need to even answer that?

663
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:53,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

664
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:55,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's done well for Sony.

665
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

666
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:59,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good, a game has done well for Sony.

667
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:00,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they need to answer that?

668
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,175
[SPEAKER_04]: They have plenty of good games on Xbox Live Arcade.

669
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, there's good games coming out every week on Xbox Live Arcade versus the PlayStation Network, which doesn't get everything each week.

670
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,001
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in our chat says, I think Microsoft owns the Fusion Frenzy license.

671
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:19,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine, but really, I really don't think these games have anything to do with Fusion Frenzy.

672
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That last game killed the series.

673
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:23,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it die.

674
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:25,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this is it.

675
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:27,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

676
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:30,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a Kinect thing.

677
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:33,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just going to be minigame garbage.

678
00:42:33,157 --> 00:42:34,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, that's where my mind goes.

679
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,201
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just a freaking name.

680
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:38,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It could also be the best game we've ever seen.

681
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:39,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we just don't know.

682
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:39,946
[SPEAKER_05]: They're names.

683
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:42,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make the best game ever and call it freaking garbage.

684
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:45,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be awesome.

685
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And you play a garbage man.

686
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,035
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.

687
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:51,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, Super Meat Boy.

688
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:58,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on the name and the box art, I was like, this game looks stupid.

689
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:00,182
[SPEAKER_05]: This game looks so stupid.

690
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I played it and I'm like, oh my god, this game's amazing.

691
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:06,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, names do not mean everything.

692
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:10,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's get to some other... Speaking of names, some other registrations.

693
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Domains.

694
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:27,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently some internet domain names that have been registered Fable The Journey New Fable game or possibly Fable Xbox Live or possibly Fable Connect Fable Connect This is what Milo turned into I'm thinking it's this

695
00:43:28,223 --> 00:43:50,494
[SPEAKER_04]: all that whole like you can have him set down in the stream and you can hold them pieces of paper interacting with people Fable the Journey is what happened to Milo I don't even think it's that far I think it's just Fable with some connectivity I guess that would be Fable 4 I've abandoned the whole Fable series anyway so to hell with it I don't even care what it is

696
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:54,296
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Connect Fun Labs is another one.

697
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:56,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That was already leaked, though, in an earlier thing.

698
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:58,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central 2, which, I mean, really?

699
00:43:58,739 --> 00:43:58,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh.

700
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:00,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh, really?

701
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect Sports Season 2.

702
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:03,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh.

703
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, also pretty much a duh.

704
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:09,085
[SPEAKER_04]: The sequels to our two most successful Kinect titles?

705
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:09,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Never!

706
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

707
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:18,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's really all about, okay, what is the Kinect going to give us that isn't part of the Wii?

708
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really interested in what this whole Kinect Star Wars thing is.

709
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:25,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, they had teased that last year and we got nothing.

710
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:28,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is the year we need to see what Kinect Star Wars is all about.

711
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:34,334
[SPEAKER_04]: All LucasArts got, you know, they have right now is just the Old Republic.

712
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:35,094
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

713
00:44:35,114 --> 00:44:37,935
[SPEAKER_04]: They have nothing else slated to come out that they've announced.

714
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

715
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

716
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:46,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Randy in our chatroom says, Hold hands in Fable with Kinect.

717
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell was that hand-holding thing anyway?

718
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:50,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it didn't make sense.

719
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say, follow me.

720
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:57,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for escorting the girl and stuff, it made sense, but did you really have to be able to hold hands and run everybody through town?

721
00:44:58,045 --> 00:44:58,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just weird.

722
00:44:59,358 --> 00:44:59,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Ico did it.

723
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ico, she was Ico.

724
00:45:04,063 --> 00:45:04,884
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on.

725
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:07,847
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the press conferences already happened, right, DarkSakura?

726
00:45:08,027 --> 00:45:08,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami.

727
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:11,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some announcements from Konami.

728
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:18,497
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the Metal Gear Solid HD collection that has Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.

729
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:20,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But the original one is not in it.

730
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

731
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:25,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Twin Snakes, though.

732
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:27,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that should have been in there.

733
00:45:27,763 --> 00:45:28,884
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already remade it once.

734
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:35,528
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it's going to be available on the PS3 and Xbox and will support 1080p.

735
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:39,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the PS3, there is a transferring feature.

736
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:42,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess transferring, I should say.

737
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It must have been misspelled.

738
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:45,854
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think they are misspelling it on purpose.

739
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:46,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

740
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:47,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their little... Transfaring?

741
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:48,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Transfaring, yeah.

742
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

743
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you can transfer your Peace Walker game from your PSP to your PS3.

744
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how they pronounce Million Merion.

745
00:45:56,361 --> 00:46:00,704
[SPEAKER_05]: You can transfer your game from the PS3 to the PSP.

746
00:46:00,964 --> 00:46:12,212
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a Zone of the Enders HD collection, so it has Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders 2, and not much else is said about that except that they're thinking it'll be out in 2012, and it'll be a PS3 and Xbox 360.

747
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,418
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will also have Transfaring.

748
00:46:18,282 --> 00:46:18,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better.

749
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:22,952
[SPEAKER_04]: But there wasn't a Zone of the Enders game on the PSP.

750
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:23,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

751
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:28,585
[SPEAKER_02]: More importantly than all of that, there's going to be a Silent Hill collection.

752
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:34,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is Silent Hill 2 and 3 and it's just basically touched up to look good in HD.

753
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:40,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't say what it's going to be on, although my assumption would be, well, PS3 and Xbox 360.

754
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can trans-fart there too.

755
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:43,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

756
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:44,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call it trans-fart.

757
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I can think of pooting noises whenever you do your trans-farting.

758
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:55,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing, the transfarring stuff... Will Psycho Mantis read my transfarted data?

759
00:46:56,536 --> 00:47:06,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a good feature anyways, because the only game you can use that for would be the PSP port, and Peace Walker is the only game.

760
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:13,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm assuming you have to have the original game for that as well, so... I don't know, it's kind of weird.

761
00:47:14,051 --> 00:47:18,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It does feel like a lot of wasted resources on something no one's going to use, correct?

762
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:18,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

763
00:47:19,015 --> 00:47:19,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

764
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:33,164
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I would think would be cool is that for those of us who have older PS3s it would be cool if there could be some way to transfer your save file but other than that, you know that would be a pipe dream

765
00:47:35,057 --> 00:47:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

766
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:03,795
[SPEAKER_05]: and her jaw dropped.

767
00:48:03,835 --> 00:48:05,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can't even control what's going on on the stage right now.

768
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the show a hot mess?

769
00:48:07,538 --> 00:48:11,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was the year that they showed Rock Revolution and they failed the song on stage.

770
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:14,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they had, what, last year, the whole Lucha Libre thing.

771
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:15,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that part of their thing?

772
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:18,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, it was just like, what in the hell is going on on the stage right now?

773
00:48:18,848 --> 00:48:22,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole, what was it, the one Marion Troops and...

774
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:25,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, the whole thing was pre-recorded.

775
00:48:52,719 --> 00:49:14,703
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was a pre-recorded slickly produced video reel it was very reminiscent of for those that have seen the Konami booth at E3 they always have a giant television well last year they remodeled it and I can't remember if they have the giant TV anymore but at least for the last few years before that they had a giant television that would cycle through all the trailers and people would kind of sit and watch it was very reminiscent of this is the video that's going to play on the giant TV all E3

776
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:19,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I found interesting.

777
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:19,727
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

778
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:27,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it was an interesting way for them to do it, and they got their message out there and didn't really get made fun of, and there's been a lot of hypes for the products.

779
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:34,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it very interesting that they did it that way, in part probably, so that it was very scripted and would not fall apart.

780
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here's my complaint.

781
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides what Jamie's going to talk about here in a second...

782
00:49:40,663 --> 00:49:42,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, is this all you've got?

783
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:44,404
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got remakes of your old shit.

784
00:49:44,925 --> 00:49:45,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

785
00:49:45,585 --> 00:49:46,925
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you've worked hard on?

786
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:52,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Is taking assets from an old game and sprucing them up.

787
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:54,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, no, you're not really playing a new game.

788
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:59,030
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just taking the old game, freshening it up a bit, and pumping it back into your console.

789
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Kojima did come out to talk about a new interface.

790
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:04,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, about his new engine for a game that he has no game for.

791
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:05,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

792
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:24,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, this is tricky though, because maybe it's a game they're going to announce But because of this whole pre-3 thing, they didn't Please, just like, you know, they would announce it anyways if they were going to have something to announce Because, I mean, seriously, where's, you know, Metal Gear Rising?

793
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:31,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they didn't mention that, it's still coming, you know, next year Even though they mentioned it two years ago, well, last year I guess

794
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:56,677
[SPEAKER_05]: yay thank you to the four chatters that all found that at once for me the Oprah bees gif have you seen it Loki um I'm afraid I have not seen my favorite fucking thing ever wait hold on oh there's a YouTube Ziba bless your heart ultimate Oprah's ultimate favorite things here we go oh I made a full screen here we go this is for you too she's

795
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They're opening the box and... Bees!

796
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:15,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're playing the I'm a bee in the background.

797
00:51:18,753 --> 00:51:21,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what we were expecting Konami's press conference to be this year.

798
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:23,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

799
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:25,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Bees!

800
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:26,455
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

801
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:30,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Book of Memories

802
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,046
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

803
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:25,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you wanted something for you guys.

804
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:27,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, we don't have anything for you.

805
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:30,007
[SPEAKER_02]: We're telling you this because we know you'll import it anyway.

806
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even have Glee for you, which is fine.

807
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,492
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to carry Revolution Glee.

808
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:42,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they announce some of that stuff kind of just in written form only, like a new DDR game is coming out too?

809
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it wasn't really in the video, but they did put out a little paper on it?

810
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I didn't see a DDR game on there.

811
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:53,585
[SPEAKER_04]: All I saw was X3, the arcade machine, and that's it.

812
00:52:55,186 --> 00:52:59,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's coming out in Japan, so that does not count, I'm afraid.

813
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:00,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

814
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:05,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, what they're spending their time on doing is taking old shit and making it new again.

815
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:07,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not even making it new, making it prettier.

816
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:09,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

817
00:53:09,797 --> 00:53:10,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

818
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:11,439
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who can get away with that?

819
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:12,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony can get away with that.

820
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know why?

821
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they put out new shit on top of that.

822
00:53:15,742 --> 00:53:20,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Loki, I think it's too early to really say that.

823
00:53:20,486 --> 00:53:23,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Because next week, we have a new Nintendo console coming out.

824
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:24,190
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

825
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:31,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm shaking, waiting for the new Elebits game that's going to come out.

826
00:53:32,795 --> 00:53:37,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe another DECA sports game, because you know there'll be another DECA sports game.

827
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:37,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with you.

828
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Deck of Sports and Elebits maybe.

829
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And what other crap do they put out whenever there's a new console?

830
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:47,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think here.

831
00:53:49,103 --> 00:53:51,624
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't put out Elebits every time there's a new console.

832
00:53:51,644 --> 00:53:53,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That happened once on the Wii.

833
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:55,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they're going to totally bring it over.

834
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:56,006
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it.

835
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:57,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they will.

836
00:53:57,346 --> 00:53:58,867
[SPEAKER_04]: You just scared Shermie.

837
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:01,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You just made Shermie leave the room in disgust.

838
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:02,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's another Hudson title too.

839
00:54:03,248 --> 00:54:06,070
[SPEAKER_02]: She's probably going to go take a shit in the hall because of your outburst.

840
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for making my cat poop!

841
00:54:09,452 --> 00:54:12,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, can we move on with another story, please?

842
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:12,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

843
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:21,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, it's... It was not disappointing because I kind of expected this little out of them.

844
00:54:22,366 --> 00:54:24,488
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was hoping they would surprise me, but...

845
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,782
[SPEAKER_04]: They might still... No, they're not.

846
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

847
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:30,485
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Konami we're talking about here.

848
00:54:30,826 --> 00:54:32,087
[SPEAKER_04]: They are never going to surprise us.

849
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:34,550
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to just come out with... I almost want to bet money on this.

850
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:38,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost want to bet money on this, but I'm not going to because I'm broke.

851
00:54:39,095 --> 00:54:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to Disneyland this week and I need my money.

852
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:43,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

853
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:44,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about something else.

854
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:48,816
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a rumor that Microsoft's going to be announcing a TV service at E3.

855
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:53,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, kind of this whole rumored IPTV thing.

856
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:59,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they're going to take it a step further and basically become their own service.

857
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So, instead of having a dish or something like that, you could have whatever we're going to call it.

858
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:07,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Xbox Live Diamond, they're saying, is what it's going to be.

859
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:11,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is funny, because I remember back in the day having the Diamond card, which gave me

860
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

861
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:17,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't it give you discounts at Quiznos for a month?

862
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:18,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

863
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:23,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Free upgrade of a 6-inch sub to a foot long?

864
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,971
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what Xbox Diamond was good for?

865
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:29,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the equivalent of those little fundraising cards that you get.

866
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertainment books.

867
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:31,673
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not even that.

868
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:32,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even the entertainment book.

869
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:39,076
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know those little fundraising cards that you get that it's like, oh, this is for all the local businesses.

870
00:55:39,096 --> 00:55:42,137
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% off of a Subway sandwich.

871
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:43,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Foursquare?

872
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:44,978
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Foursquare.

873
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:46,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Predating all of that.

874
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:51,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's hard to think of a time that Foursquare didn't exist.

875
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,381
[SPEAKER_05]: All I can think of is the entertainment books, honestly.

876
00:55:53,922 --> 00:55:58,634
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd sell them for like $35 and all it was was like, buy one, get one free.

877
00:55:58,654 --> 00:55:59,657
[SPEAKER_04]: We sold those and banned.

878
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:01,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm never going to use all this.

879
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:07,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Back before there was Groupon, there was Entertainment Books.

880
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:11,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so they're saying that it's going to be for an additional monthly fee.

881
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:13,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically going to be like a virtual cable operator.

882
00:56:16,434 --> 00:56:21,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So not really too much that we know, or if it's even going to be announced.

883
00:56:21,658 --> 00:56:28,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be kind of neat, because honestly, cable's fucking expensive, so if I can get something decent for cheaper...

884
00:56:29,246 --> 00:56:30,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but correct me if I'm wrong.

885
00:56:31,108 --> 00:56:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: If net neutrality, this whole thing about the websites will soon be able to block whatever, or the, I'm sorry, internet providers will soon be able to block whatever they want goes through, do you think Comcast is going to have this?

886
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:43,603
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll just be like, oh, block.

887
00:56:45,265 --> 00:56:48,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless Microsoft has somehow bought in to the providers.

888
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And they kind of have done this with ESPN.

889
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you connect to the ESPN, it shows in the corner when I connect, it says brought to you by Comcast.

890
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:58,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it knows what you're connecting to them through.

891
00:56:58,951 --> 00:56:59,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

892
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:05,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So either there's going to be an agreement or this little TV network that they're doing might be...

893
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:08,156
[SPEAKER_05]: and their own set of channels.

894
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:12,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be tied to regular TV.

895
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:22,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember about a year ago it had come out that before Conan signed the deal with TBS he had entertained the notion about doing a nightly show on Xbox Live?

896
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been awesome.

897
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:28,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I think there's a lot of truth to this because I think Microsoft's been trying to build this for some time.

898
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:36,865
[SPEAKER_05]: and they have a similar service in UK although granted it's not their own channel so I don't know where it's going to fall.

899
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:45,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there absolutely will be at least one new Microsoft channel in this and of course MSNBC.

900
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:48,292
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

901
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:24,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Other news about other things going on at E3 Q Games is going to be showing three titles at E3 Please note that this is not the same thing as Q Entertainment

902
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:52,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I had actually made that mistake a little earlier on I thought this was about Q Entertainment but no Q Games is the company that makes like PixelJunk Shooter and PixelJunk they make all those games they're apparently they have like a preview online for one other PixelJunk game and it was a little bit weird that title it was PixelJunk Lifelike they had done a little preview of that apparently they are going to do two unannounced projects at E3 could they be more PixelJunk games

903
00:58:54,563 --> 00:59:21,985
[SPEAKER_05]: seems to be a lot of what they do now I bet one of them will be but one of them might be something a little new maybe for another console or something like that IDK but not the same as Q Entertainment who makes Luminous and you know Rez and all that Child of Eden Mizuguchi Studio different so there you go well we would move on to another story but DarkSakura left the studio so let me just yell at Loki some more

904
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,420
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

905
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:41,430
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

906
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:04,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can control your pets, and you can breed them and share them.

907
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:07,279
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox 360 version will have Kinect capabilities.

908
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You can control the Sims and their pets with voice commands.

909
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, it's like...

910
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:16,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Make Out!

911
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll make out.

912
01:00:18,511 --> 01:00:19,052
[SPEAKER_02]: That type of thing.

913
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But pets, for the 3DS, will have a pedometer so you get more karma points the more that you walk.

914
01:00:25,257 --> 01:00:26,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use it to buy in-game items.

915
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:31,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the Street Pass, you can get pets to other pets owners.

916
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:33,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, there you go.

917
01:00:34,024 --> 01:00:40,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just hoping that it, I would rather that for the PC one that it works a lot more like the old Pets expansion did.

918
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:47,019
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have, you can build your dog house and you can have your cat and you have to clean up your cat's poo and that type of thing.

919
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd make a big fat Shermie.

920
01:00:49,422 --> 01:00:50,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like fun.

921
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:57,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sims is for people who don't want to play Second Life, but, you know, it's a lot more fun.

922
01:00:57,284 --> 01:00:57,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

923
01:00:57,985 --> 01:01:00,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe... They want to play Second Life by themselves.

924
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:02,712
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, now I have to get Generations if I want to play this one.

925
01:01:02,852 --> 01:01:03,693
[SPEAKER_05]: It's RPM.

926
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:04,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Roleplay Masturbation.

927
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:06,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's self-serving.

928
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:08,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

929
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:11,764
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sims is still the best selling PC game ever, right?

930
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:12,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

931
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:14,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think WoW beat it.

932
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:15,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

933
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:18,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel the world and look at some release dates.

934
01:01:18,492 --> 01:01:22,196
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't want to get The Sims, maybe there's something else coming out to a store near you very soon.

935
01:01:23,057 --> 01:01:25,558
[SPEAKER_04]: This week there's actually quite a few things coming out.

936
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:26,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of nice.

937
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start things off.

938
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Infamous 2 on the PlayStation 3.

939
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:33,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be coming out this week.

940
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:40,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Faction Armageddon coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

941
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:42,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

942
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:44,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week...

943
01:01:47,032 --> 01:02:10,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Operation Flashpoint Red River that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC as well let's see here I really wish these lists would load up faster that's pretty much the big releases this week the rest is just crap I'll leave it at that

944
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:13,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you got these games and a bunch of crap.

945
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:14,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's coming out this week.

946
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:22,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think they have like a fucking triple pack for Ben 10 or some garbage like that.

947
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:25,233
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's your thing, then cool.

948
01:02:27,274 --> 01:02:28,715
[SPEAKER_04]: What other garbage do they have here?

949
01:02:29,316 --> 01:02:31,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem Critical Mass, but that's not actually coming out at that time.

950
01:02:32,118 --> 01:02:32,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Green Lantern.

951
01:02:32,938 --> 01:02:36,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's a movie tie-in game for that, which I'm sure will be just wonderful.

952
01:02:36,581 --> 01:02:38,722
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.

953
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and DS and 3DS because that's a good 3DS title right there.

954
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

955
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:55,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I forgot because this is actually about a week from today.

956
01:02:56,133 --> 01:02:58,654
[SPEAKER_04]: WePlayMotion will be coming out for Nintendo.

957
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:00,495
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the innovative content that they have.

958
01:03:00,515 --> 01:03:02,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, WePlay sold really well.

959
01:03:02,736 --> 01:03:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make another one of those.

960
01:03:04,057 --> 01:03:08,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will be coming out for Nintendo with a black Wii Remote Plus.

961
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:10,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

962
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:15,326
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on to Japanese release dates.

963
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:16,326
[SPEAKER_05]: What's coming out over there?

964
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:20,169
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox 360 on June 9th, the Gears of War Twin Pack.

965
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:24,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Platinum Collection now, so a little bit of a price reduction for those of you guys in Japan.

966
01:03:24,152 --> 01:03:33,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Phantom Breaker in a limited edition, Red Faction Armageddon, and Riot Act 2 goes into the Platinum Collection, so that is also getting a price reduction.

967
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Riot Act 2 is Crackdown.

968
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:37,603
[SPEAKER_05]: What's their version of Crackdown?

969
01:03:39,364 --> 01:04:00,458
[SPEAKER_05]: moving on to other consoles such as the PlayStation 3 Red Faction Armageddon there as well Ryu Ga Gotoku comes out of the end is what that's called that is coming out on the 9th from Sega this is a Yakuza zombie game yeah that looks pretty cool could be interesting are they bringing that out over here?

970
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:01,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

971
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:03,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not been announced yet.

972
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:08,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yakuza Zombies, maybe that's something you'll see at E3 next week, a localized version of that.

973
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:10,939
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Nintendo Wii, nothing.

974
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,143
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 3DS though, Fish On comes out this week.

975
01:04:15,363 --> 01:04:17,005
[SPEAKER_05]: You guessed it, it's a fishing game.

976
01:04:17,545 --> 01:04:18,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's 3D.

977
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:19,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

978
01:04:20,368 --> 01:04:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have never guessed it's a fishing game.

979
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly on the Sony PSP really not a lot this week there's another Evangelion limited edition thing it's a Pachi game tabashi so I'm thinking that is what another pachinko Evangelion game

980
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the screenshots.

981
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:40,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like a little slot machine.

982
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:41,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Little gambling games.

983
01:04:41,915 --> 01:04:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Little mini games.

984
01:04:42,955 --> 01:04:43,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Gambling slots.

985
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:47,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a revamped Evangelion series out.

986
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:52,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, it's been getting a big side product reboot.

987
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

988
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

989
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it for your Japanese releases.

990
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever and ever.

991
01:05:22,912 --> 01:05:24,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me, Loki, what's going on?

992
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:26,635
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

993
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on as we have rumors about the Wii successor?

994
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,692
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stuff that we've all kind of heard about before.

995
01:05:51,873 --> 01:05:58,998
[SPEAKER_04]: This is coming from Nikkei, and this is basically the same publication that also predicted the DSi.

996
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,519
[SPEAKER_04]: The DSi XL, the 3DS.

997
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:06,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're predicting stuff for the new Wii console or new Nintendo console.

998
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:11,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, they are saying that it's coming out on the second half of 2012.

999
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:13,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, fourth quarter.

1000
01:06:13,468 --> 01:06:13,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

1001
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:19,986
[SPEAKER_04]: and that it will also have the 6-inch touchscreen on the controller.

1002
01:06:21,058 --> 01:06:23,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically repeating what everybody else has been saying.

1003
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:30,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, apparently, they're supposed to be having some sort of camera on the actual controller as well.

1004
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:44,356
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that the company OmniVision, who's worked with Apple on its iPhone, supplying them with cameras, is also apparently supplying Nintendo with cameras as well.

1005
01:06:44,576 --> 01:06:47,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interestingly.

1006
01:06:49,144 --> 01:06:49,985
[SPEAKER_04]: That they're going to do that.

1007
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:56,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was one other rumor that didn't make our show roll because it was very, very, very last minute.

1008
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:04,015
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rumor is that Nintendo's next console might be called Nintendo.

1009
01:07:06,497 --> 01:07:07,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1010
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:09,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how much effort they're putting into their console.

1011
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even want to fucking name it.

1012
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:13,325
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1013
01:07:13,525 --> 01:07:15,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't think it's that terrible of a name.

1014
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:19,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was a rumor that the Wii was going to be called that, that it's just the Nintendo.

1015
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:22,409
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole reboot idea.

1016
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:31,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't think it's a terrible idea, because if you go back to when all we had was the Nintendo, it was like, hey, you want to come over to my house and play Nintendo?

1017
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:32,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It became...

1018
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:36,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a verb, you know what I mean?

1019
01:07:36,654 --> 01:07:39,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Xeroxing, Kleenex, one of those types of things.

1020
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So calling it the Nintendo Nintendo, I don't think it's a terrible name.

1021
01:07:47,018 --> 01:07:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see like Nintendo HD or something like that.

1022
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:55,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people's reaction will be, oh, okay, but I don't think you can say that's a bad name.

1023
01:07:57,414 --> 01:08:19,094
[SPEAKER_05]: to be fair, the original Nintendo was really called the Nintendo Entertainment System so if they're calling this just the Nintendo, it is a new name but I actually don't believe it I think because to call the system your company when you're trying to also launch a 3DS thing side by side I actually don't buy it

1024
01:08:20,402 --> 01:08:26,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I would give more cred to Nintendo HD or Nintendo with a very small suffix to it.

1025
01:08:30,045 --> 01:08:30,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1026
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Randy in our chatroom says, not Nintendo, THE Nintendo.

1027
01:08:34,067 --> 01:08:36,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, the next console called Nintendo.

1028
01:08:36,187 --> 01:08:37,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking called that two weeks ago.

1029
01:08:38,028 --> 01:08:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you gotta wait till Tuesday before you get to parade that.

1030
01:08:40,829 --> 01:09:00,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop to play Nintendo is still relevant vernacular in my opinion so if they want to make a play on that it's not that surprising that's kind of where I'm at my mom still calls it all Nintendo when I showed her Mortal Kombat she was like oh you're gonna fire up the Nintendo okay maybe not like that but you know it's all the same to her

1031
01:09:01,866 --> 01:09:03,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

1032
01:09:04,108 --> 01:09:07,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, one other story I want to get to before we get to the classic game of the week.

1033
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is important.

1034
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:14,416
[SPEAKER_05]: This has to do with, of course, fundraising efforts that are still going on for Japanese tsunami relief.

1035
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:16,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, it doesn't fix itself overnight.

1036
01:09:17,599 --> 01:09:21,002
[SPEAKER_05]: This fundraising effort is going to go on for years and years.

1037
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:28,588
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, again, not to bring up really bad memories of the past, but when Hurricane Katrina happened, that took years to clean up.

1038
01:09:28,648 --> 01:09:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And some would argue...

1039
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:30,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

1040
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:31,470
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

1041
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:48,419
[SPEAKER_05]: The track list was announced this week.

1042
01:09:48,459 --> 01:09:49,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the new news.

1043
01:09:49,779 --> 01:09:52,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Just going over some of the cool things that are going to be on here.

1044
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,861
[SPEAKER_05]: There's original songs here.

1045
01:09:55,561 --> 01:09:58,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Akira Yamaoka has a song called Ex-Animo.

1046
01:09:59,302 --> 01:10:02,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Koji Kondo has a Super Mario medley on two pianos.

1047
01:10:03,683 --> 01:10:08,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Mitsuzo Suzuki, Play For You, Tommy Tallarico, Greater Lights.

1048
01:10:08,965 --> 01:10:12,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just folks in Japan, but it's Western composers as well.

1049
01:10:13,728 --> 01:10:19,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch the thing that Akira Yamaoka was talking about?

1050
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:21,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not watch the video.

1051
01:10:21,829 --> 01:10:24,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have it here, but did you watch it?

1052
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:24,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

1053
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:25,430
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

1054
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.

1055
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:27,531
[SPEAKER_02]: What was in it?

1056
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:39,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Just talking about working with people from all over the world that worked in the industry specifically related to music and getting some of the best names out there and that everything was going towards Japan Relief.

1057
01:10:39,396 --> 01:10:48,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just thanking people involved and thanking people to buy it and saying, hey, for all of you following us, we recognize we have a world audience and that type of thing.

1058
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1059
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:50,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, also, how could I forget?

1060
01:10:50,602 --> 01:10:52,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobuo Uematsu has a new song, Every New Morning.

1061
01:10:53,005 --> 01:10:53,906
[SPEAKER_05]: You know Nobuo Uematsu.

1062
01:10:54,706 --> 01:11:00,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, 100% of the proceeds from the Play for Japan, the album, will go straight to the Japanese Red Cross.

1063
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: More information available, playforjapan.org.

1064
01:11:04,217 --> 01:11:05,238
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is great, too.

1065
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:08,722
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be released in early June on the iTunes Store.

1066
01:11:09,162 --> 01:11:13,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, you know, argue if you will if you hate Apple or whatever, but it is a huge store.

1067
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:14,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very easy.

1068
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:19,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I like about it is that I remember a time three years ago it was very hard to find video game music on iTunes.

1069
01:11:20,285 --> 01:11:24,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it seems like it's really broken through, and it's pretty easy to find a lot of the newer soundtracks on there.

1070
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:27,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So props to iTunes, who hopefully will be featuring that.

1071
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be available for sale.

1072
01:11:29,788 --> 01:11:32,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, 100% of the proceeds go to the Japanese Red Cross.

1073
01:11:32,408 --> 01:11:33,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Playforjapan.org.

1074
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:37,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into the classic game of the week.

1075
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:41,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week here on the show we like to highlight a game from gaming's past.

1076
01:11:42,032 --> 01:11:58,360
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura likes to jump into the vault and say, Hey, look, while you're talking about your newfangled Nintendos of the present, I remember Nintendos back in my day, back when we played awesome games such as this one.

1077
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:02,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Bionic Commando for the NES

1078
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:23,513
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, it's kind of based off of the 87 Bionic Commando.

1079
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:24,173
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came out in 88.

1080
01:12:24,213 --> 01:12:38,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you basically have to explore different stages and you play as Lad Spencer, who is going to rescue the guy from the first game, who was called Super Joe, who was captured by, uh,

1081
01:12:39,643 --> 01:12:50,010
[SPEAKER_02]: The Empire, because you've got to go stop the Empire, the General of the Imperial Forces, who is completing the project himself.

1082
01:12:50,671 --> 01:13:03,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to go and rescue Super Joe and lead the FF Battalion, or Double Force Battalion, who are all commandos who use wired guns to rescue him.

1083
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:17,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a stage select map and you move around the map screen and you can choose to move to different areas but you have to go back and go through these overhead areas to get to different places.

1084
01:13:17,968 --> 01:13:26,033
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 19 areas in the game, 1 through 12 are combat and 13 and 19 are all neutral areas where you can't fight at all.

1085
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:34,059
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fire your weapon at all in those areas, you'll be attacked by a peacekeeping force.

1086
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are places that you can get information and items.

1087
01:13:39,643 --> 01:13:44,567
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also green enemy trucks on the map selection that will try to block your helicopter.

1088
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:49,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you fly into one of these while you're traveling, you have to battle the troops.

1089
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:51,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the overhead part I was talking about.

1090
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like Commando.

1091
01:13:52,152 --> 01:13:53,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1092
01:13:56,596 --> 01:14:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually kill certain enemies to get additional continues.

1093
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:17,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a bionic arm, so you can't jump, you just use the arm, and you latch on and can swing yourself at 45 degrees, or you can go up, or exactly right, so you've got different ways that you can move, but it's really just those three ways.

1094
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:23,814
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also use the arm to deflect some bullets and grab different enemies and items.

1095
01:14:24,975 --> 01:14:26,096
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1096
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:52,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at any rate, there were clearly changes that were made to the game.

1097
01:14:53,296 --> 01:14:58,477
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can probably tell from the Japanese title, the whole thing was basically about fighting Nazis.

1098
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:06,139
[SPEAKER_02]: The Empire was like a neo-Nazi nation, and they used a swastika for their logo.

1099
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:16,401
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course when it came out over here, they changed the logo and everything, and they changed things to the Imperial Forces and blah blah.

1100
01:15:18,201 --> 01:15:27,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the end boss still looks like Hitler, but they called him Master D. It's like, hi, we kind of know who that is.

1101
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Except you do get to see his head explode, which is pretty cool.

1102
01:15:30,844 --> 01:15:32,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he was a fuckhead.

1103
01:15:33,775 --> 01:15:40,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I gotta say, TigerClaw in the chatroom says, this game is from an era before the ESRB, so they were able to get away with some gore on an NES game.

1104
01:15:40,659 --> 01:15:43,901
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't just because of the ESRB, that was Nintendo's own policy to get rid of the gore.

1105
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:46,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, heads exploding, you didn't see that in many games.

1106
01:15:46,621 --> 01:15:49,102
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and it was a gory-ass explosion.

1107
01:15:49,162 --> 01:15:51,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was like, bleh, everywhere.

1108
01:15:52,022 --> 01:15:55,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there have been other remakes.

1109
01:15:55,623 --> 01:16:11,128
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a portable version of Bayek Commando on the Game Boy in 1992 that was based off of the NES game, but it was turned into a futuristic one because this was actually set in the 80s when it was made in the 80s.

1110
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:23,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was, of course, Bionic Commando Rearmed that was developed by Grin and it came out in 2008 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1111
01:16:24,577 --> 01:16:26,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sequel that came out February 2011.

1112
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:34,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the original NES Bionic Commando was featured on a Game Boy Advance compilation.

1113
01:16:34,704 --> 01:16:39,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Capcom Classics Minimix, which also included Strider and Mighty Final Fight.

1114
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:40,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Two really good games.

1115
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:42,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe not in the NES trailer, but still.

1116
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:49,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh... There's also a book, a novelization, that was based off of the NES version.

1117
01:16:49,799 --> 01:16:51,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So the main character's called Jack Markson.

1118
01:16:52,342 --> 01:16:55,866
[SPEAKER_02]: He lost his arm when ninjas attacked his hotel room and kidnapped Super Joe.

1119
01:16:56,567 --> 01:16:58,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So they replaced it with... Sounds like a Michael Bay movie.

1120
01:16:58,789 --> 01:16:59,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1121
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:23,748
[SPEAKER_02]: they replaced it with a bionic limb with a grappling hook and other neato things so there's different things the book was super toned down and they didn't kill anybody although certain things like some of the deaths of Hal and Kilt are kept in and they just sort of skim over most of the stuff that goes on so they can fit in the book

1122
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:34,383
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's an illustrated Bionic Commando story actually on a website that I will be linking in the chat room and if you're not in the chat room, oh well, too bad.

1123
01:17:37,744 --> 01:17:40,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you can find out about Super Joe and about Spencer.

1124
01:17:41,966 --> 01:17:42,226
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1125
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:48,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Bionic Commando for the NES.

1126
01:17:49,614 --> 01:18:00,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to be confused with the arcade version, or as Ziba keeps asking about in the chatroom, the Commodore 64 version, which I don't even remember playing, but I'm pretty sure it was based off the arcade more than it was the NES.

1127
01:18:00,203 --> 01:18:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, you did see the magazine that I linked to you, right?

1128
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:11,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro Gamer is doing a Commodore 64 special this month, as well as the Anniversary of Street Fighter.

1129
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more Commodore 64 games in our Classic Game of the Week.

1130
01:18:15,312 --> 01:18:17,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess who didn't play much Commodore 64?

1131
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:18,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

1132
01:18:18,415 --> 01:18:21,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week that you're not here, I end up doing something for Commodore 64.

1133
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then why don't you pick the week after, huh?

1134
01:18:23,839 --> 01:18:24,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, we'll see.

1135
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then.

1136
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:25,700
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1137
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:28,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to do this segment or me?

1138
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:30,064
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's DarkSakura's Game of the Week.

1139
01:18:30,264 --> 01:18:31,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll pick something.

1140
01:18:31,405 --> 01:18:31,685
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1141
01:18:31,865 --> 01:18:36,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I've covered stuff that have imported to the... Maybe I'll pick a Spectrum game.

1142
01:18:37,049 --> 01:18:37,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that works.

1143
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a Vetrex.

1144
01:18:39,271 --> 01:18:41,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just Spectre was a great PC game back in the day.

1145
01:18:42,153 --> 01:18:43,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pick a Vetrix game.

1146
01:18:43,634 --> 01:18:43,954
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1147
01:18:44,074 --> 01:18:44,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1148
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:48,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1149
01:18:48,697 --> 01:18:50,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a busy part B tonight.

1150
01:18:50,118 --> 01:18:54,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Your Twitter topics, as you send those in, hurry up and get them in at twitter.com slash OLR.

1151
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:56,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got rapid-fire news.

1152
01:18:56,321 --> 01:18:58,303
[SPEAKER_05]: News about Call of Duty's Elite system.

1153
01:18:58,343 --> 01:19:00,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been catching a lot of press this week.

1154
01:19:00,924 --> 01:19:05,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Also news about the 3DS shop we're going to get into and our E3 predictions.

1155
01:19:05,827 --> 01:19:10,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into those as well in just a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1156
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:17,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

1157
01:19:38,895 --> 01:19:43,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can actually go in there and there's actually a compiled list of every episode we ever did.

1158
01:19:44,499 --> 01:19:48,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, keep scrolling, keep scrolling, keep scrolling.

1159
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:49,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty impressive.

1160
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:52,285
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be going on 10 years next year.

1161
01:19:52,305 --> 01:19:53,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1162
01:19:54,226 --> 01:19:56,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we don't want to toot our own horn.

1163
01:19:56,628 --> 01:19:59,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it is talking about the... I can toot our horn if we want.

1164
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:02,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's talking about the E3 coverage we're going to bring you next week.

1165
01:20:02,312 --> 01:20:05,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday and Wednesday night, 7pm Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern at Ustream.

1166
01:20:06,054 --> 01:20:10,537
[SPEAKER_05]: A little something new for us, but it'll be cool because we can play around with video and visuals a little bit.

1167
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:13,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be available to... My God, you alright over there?

1168
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be available on Ustream.

1169
01:20:16,341 --> 01:20:26,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're really good, because you can do Ustream broadcasting from your phone now, maybe I'll do a Ustream broadcast of us getting Bobby on California Screamin'.

1170
01:20:28,049 --> 01:20:29,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to explain what just happened.

1171
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:29,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what happened?

1172
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:41,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran over the cord for my headphones and then when I moved my chair it ran over the cord of the microphone and yanked it out of my hand and then I had it all the way wrapped around my legs and then I rolled over my foot.

1173
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:42,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

1174
01:20:42,517 --> 01:20:43,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry everybody for that.

1175
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a klutz.

1176
01:20:44,218 --> 01:20:44,819
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.

1177
01:20:44,879 --> 01:20:46,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, just accident prone.

1178
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:51,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to plugs for the spinoff shows then we'll get to rapid fire news.

1179
01:20:51,703 --> 01:20:53,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So, quickly, the spinoff shows.

1180
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:55,205
[SPEAKER_05]: The other shows that we do when we're not doing OLR.

1181
01:20:55,785 --> 01:20:56,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Comic Insanity.

1182
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:00,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at Infamous.net and a new episode will be up on Tuesday.

1183
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:03,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So go there and listen to us.

1184
01:21:03,523 --> 01:21:05,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it with Mar and Marvel and Dan Jetto.

1185
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:06,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Comics!

1186
01:21:35,672 --> 01:21:39,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's move on with some rapid-fire news, and there's a lot this week.

1187
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:42,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, your tweets, so you better get those in, because we're almost done.

1188
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1189
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:49,987
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, speaking of Twitter, I want to get a plug out for this, because Bobby is helping us with those E3 wrap-up shows.

1190
01:21:50,648 --> 01:21:53,791
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to be helping us get interviews.

1191
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:56,814
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to be, I mean, they're like...

1192
01:21:57,094 --> 01:21:59,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly his shows, probably, if you think about it.

1193
01:21:59,055 --> 01:22:00,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, we'll be here giving our smart-ass commentary.

1194
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to say about Bobby, speaking of Twitter, if you're not following Bobby on Twitter, you should be, because he's kind of doing, he's biting an idea we did a couple years ago, but with permission.

1195
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:11,842
[SPEAKER_05]: We told him we could.

1196
01:22:12,422 --> 01:22:31,959
[SPEAKER_05]: uh that is you drive him on the show floor he is very minimal appointments so if you're like Bobby I heard this game might be on the show floor and uh nobody's covering it he'll go find out for you so all that stuff that used to be in Kensha Hall that's now kind of sprinkled throughout the East Halls and West Halls uh he'll go find that stuff for you

1197
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:35,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know what Natsume's putting out right now.

1198
01:22:35,749 --> 01:22:36,769
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the first assignment.

1199
01:22:36,789 --> 01:22:38,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1200
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:42,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, Twin Cities or Twin Town.

1201
01:22:42,452 --> 01:22:52,057
[SPEAKER_05]: We demand that Bobby goes to Natsume's booth, finds the largest chibi thing that they have on display in the booth and get a picture with it.

1202
01:22:53,263 --> 01:22:53,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Harvest Moon.

1203
01:22:53,903 --> 01:22:54,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1204
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:55,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Harvest Moon.

1205
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:58,446
[SPEAKER_05]: No, one year they had the tulip game they were showing.

1206
01:22:58,466 --> 01:22:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: The tulip game was great.

1207
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did come out.

1208
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:02,369
[SPEAKER_04]: You run up and kiss people.

1209
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:03,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It did come out.

1210
01:23:03,089 --> 01:23:04,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a GameStop exclusive.

1211
01:23:05,931 --> 01:23:09,373
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want a cow.

1212
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:12,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I want cow swag from the Harvest Moon people.

1213
01:23:13,516 --> 01:23:15,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like a pig from them.

1214
01:23:15,697 --> 01:23:17,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sheep somewhere.

1215
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:18,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I have their pig.

1216
01:23:18,939 --> 01:23:19,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want a cow.

1217
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:20,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm holding a ransom.

1218
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:23,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want a pig, it's not kosher.

1219
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:57,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Aftermath, Map Pack, and Skin Bundle with the Wraith skin, multiplayer skin for Resistance 2.

1220
01:23:58,452 --> 01:23:58,933
[SPEAKER_04]: All for $40.

1221
01:23:59,393 --> 01:24:05,999
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I actually may pick this up because I sold back Resistance 1 a while ago and I never really finished Resistance 2 before I sold it back.

1222
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:10,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really looking forward to number 3, so might have to pick it up again.

1223
01:24:11,204 --> 01:24:11,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.

1224
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:13,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1225
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:27,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, this is kind of interesting because usually you hear about these type of things when people are doing their own kind of portable console mods, but they're actually selling portable Dreamcasts.

1226
01:24:27,768 --> 01:24:36,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, these are not necessarily, I think, official Dreamcast items actually sanctioned by Sega or something.

1227
01:24:36,597 --> 01:24:39,239
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's actually a portable system.

1228
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:41,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to go for 38,000 yen, or roughly $470 US.

1229
01:24:51,021 --> 01:24:51,742
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of crazy.

1230
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:54,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It does look like something like Ben Heck would put out.

1231
01:24:55,765 --> 01:25:00,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, very vacuum-formed shell and whatnot.

1232
01:25:01,109 --> 01:25:08,315
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if you're really interested in a portable Dreamcast, seriously, you're better off building your own because it'd be way cheaper.

1233
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Way cheaper.

1234
01:25:11,394 --> 01:25:20,684
[SPEAKER_04]: and then finally, if you wanted to pick up the U-Draw and you don't own a Wii, you can now do that because it'll be coming out on 360 and PlayStation 3.

1235
01:25:21,305 --> 01:25:22,786
[SPEAKER_04]: HD U-Draw!

1236
01:25:23,187 --> 01:25:23,947
[SPEAKER_04]: HD U-Draw.

1237
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:26,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting some enhancements.

1238
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a multi-touch tablet.

1239
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:34,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have a high-definition input, 2000x1600 resolution.

1240
01:25:35,378 --> 01:25:38,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll be able to do the pinch and stretch, rotate features.

1241
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:39,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Pictionary HD.

1242
01:25:39,962 --> 01:25:41,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's built-in tilt sensors.

1243
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:43,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can draw penises in HD.

1244
01:25:44,606 --> 01:26:01,325
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course they'll be coming with UDraw Studio where in this case it's going to be kind of a souped up UDraw Studio UDraw Studio Instant Artist with tutorials and new interfaces and stuff like that and of course there's going to be supporting different UDraw titles like Pictionary and that kind of thing um

1245
01:26:01,946 --> 01:26:03,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it looks kind of interesting.

1246
01:26:04,007 --> 01:26:11,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Just from what I've seen with UDraw on the Wii, the support for it is kind of eh, because it's only THQ that's putting stuff out.

1247
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:18,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know that we heard rumors that maybe Nintendo might put something out for it, and everyone's hoping for Mario Paint, but eh, I don't know.

1248
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:22,055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stretch, I think.

1249
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:24,277
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least THQ's supporting it.

1250
01:26:24,337 --> 01:26:29,319
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the Wii, I want to say there's about five games out for it now.

1251
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:31,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's not bad.

1252
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, get a real tablet.

1253
01:26:34,121 --> 01:26:36,203
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, hey, look at it this way.

1254
01:26:36,263 --> 01:26:37,743
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bob Ross game lives on.

1255
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:39,444
[SPEAKER_05]: You can paint happy little trees.

1256
01:26:39,645 --> 01:26:40,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's be real.

1257
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:41,646
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all drawing penises with it.

1258
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:50,290
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, one thing I forgot to mention about that Duke Nukem Forever demo, there's a whiteboard in it that seems to exist for no other reason than for 12-year-olds to draw penises on it.

1259
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1260
01:26:52,151 --> 01:26:55,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the onlookers will commentate, oh, that sounds like a good plan, Duke.

1261
01:26:55,933 --> 01:26:56,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1262
01:26:57,274 --> 01:26:57,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, wiener.

1263
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:30,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be cool though if they did, you know, put, they really need a new Magic Pendulum game.

1264
01:27:31,108 --> 01:27:32,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, that'd be awesome.

1265
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:36,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Breakman in our chatroom says, 3D vaginas are ugly.

1266
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw Cloverfield too.

1267
01:27:42,532 --> 01:27:42,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

1268
01:27:44,073 --> 01:27:44,393
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1269
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey, then let's get to more news.

1270
01:27:46,554 --> 01:27:49,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael J. Fox is going to be in the Back to the Future games.

1271
01:27:50,276 --> 01:27:58,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty cool because he wasn't in the first few, but they are going to bring him back for the fifth and, I guess, the last game in the Back to the Future.

1272
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, these are the Telltale Games episodic.

1273
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:01,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the thing.

1274
01:28:01,582 --> 01:28:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not going to just simply replace A.J.

1275
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:07,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Loscaio, who's been doing the voice and apparently been doing a very good job.

1276
01:28:07,685 --> 01:28:09,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael J. Fox is going to be in the conclusion of...

1277
01:28:10,306 --> 01:28:11,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1278
01:28:34,828 --> 01:28:35,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Three is poop.

1279
01:28:36,089 --> 01:28:36,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Three didn't happen.

1280
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:39,130
[SPEAKER_02]: This movie is really good.

1281
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any good one-liners?

1282
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:43,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?

1283
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,453
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but my favorite line in the whole movie is, fuck off.

1284
01:28:47,473 --> 01:28:48,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.

1285
01:28:49,054 --> 01:28:49,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you got it.

1286
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:50,535
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

1287
01:28:51,495 --> 01:28:55,217
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the X-Men goes, the reason why I bring it up... Oh, now I forget why I bring it up.

1288
01:28:55,237 --> 01:28:56,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did I bring it up?

1289
01:28:56,337 --> 01:29:02,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we were talking about... Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were originally supposed to have a cameo in it.

1290
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:14,270
[SPEAKER_05]: as, I guess, playing the older versions, kind of like they did in the original X-Men movie, but they didn't film it and nixed it because they didn't want the new X-Men movie tied to the original at all.

1291
01:29:15,532 --> 01:29:16,353
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1292
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:46,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just like, my god, if somebody tried to play a young Captain Jean-Luc Picard, like, I don't think I'd ever be able to believe it.

1293
01:29:46,174 --> 01:29:46,995
[SPEAKER_11]: They tried to do that.

1294
01:29:47,695 --> 01:29:48,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1295
01:29:48,036 --> 01:29:48,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, they did.

1296
01:29:49,076 --> 01:29:50,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, they did, yeah.

1297
01:29:50,657 --> 01:29:57,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, how fucking annoying is it that he picked Arnold Schwarzenegger to be Mr. Freeze over Patrick Stewart?

1298
01:29:58,002 --> 01:29:59,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been perfect!

1299
01:30:00,063 --> 01:30:00,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect!

1300
01:30:00,804 --> 01:30:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started.

1301
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:01,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But no.

1302
01:30:01,964 --> 01:30:03,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, it's a good thing Patrick Stewart stayed away from it.

1303
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:05,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know what, it would have killed him.

1304
01:30:05,527 --> 01:30:07,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, it would have been Earl Julia all over again.

1305
01:30:09,831 --> 01:30:10,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, L.A.

1306
01:30:10,492 --> 01:30:12,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Noire, which is a game that Loki's loaning me.

1307
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:12,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited.

1308
01:30:12,973 --> 01:30:14,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I can take it out of my queue.

1309
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:15,074
[SPEAKER_05]: L.A.

1310
01:30:15,114 --> 01:30:17,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Noire has got some download content that's going to be coming out.

1311
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:22,318
[SPEAKER_05]: DLC is going to come, what, May 17th all the way through July 12th.

1312
01:30:22,338 --> 01:30:24,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's DLC cases that you can download.

1313
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,980
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them's called Reefer Madness.

1314
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it plays into the movie.

1315
01:30:27,681 --> 01:30:29,222
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, The Naked City.

1316
01:30:29,762 --> 01:30:31,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope we see some more nude people.

1317
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:33,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's coming out on May 31st for $4.00.

1318
01:30:34,545 --> 01:30:38,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, if you want to buy all this stuff a la carte, you can pay $20 for it.

1319
01:30:38,889 --> 01:30:44,393
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can also pre-buy all of it for $10 with what's called the Rockstar Pass.

1320
01:30:44,834 --> 01:30:47,336
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have until June 14th to take advantage of that.

1321
01:30:47,396 --> 01:30:49,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it's going up to $12 after that.

1322
01:30:50,138 --> 01:30:50,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1323
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:52,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of stuff coming out.

1324
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,404
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even, I guess, challenges, new suits and guns and whatever, horse armor.

1325
01:30:58,164 --> 01:31:01,647
[SPEAKER_05]: But also the social club things, May 17th.

1326
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:03,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting stuff.

1327
01:31:05,723 --> 01:31:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: so LA Noire DLC speaking of download stuff and all this stuff Capcom has reversed a decision we reported on no actually we didn't report on this last week because I think we weren't here so Capcom did take that DRM I seem to remember talking about it this annoying DRM was going to be in Super Street Fighter 4 on the PC that if you are not connected to the internet it won't bork the game but you'll be limited to 15 fighters and of course people raised hell on the forums and Capcom said

1328
01:31:34,998 --> 01:31:58,728
[SPEAKER_05]: okay okay we're back and down yeah you you will be able to play as everybody even if not connected to the internet however as one would logically expect you won't have online multiplayer replay sharing or watching and achievements unless you're online and logged in which yeah that does make sense I think so there you go the consumers win I think moving on

1329
01:32:00,185 --> 01:32:01,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have other news.

1330
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Final Fantasy V rated by the ESRB for a PSN release in North America, which is pretty good.

1331
01:32:08,748 --> 01:32:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be getting lots of classic games, and hopefully it's going to have the same treatment that 3 and those had.

1332
01:32:17,672 --> 01:32:21,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have Duke Nukem Forever download content details.

1333
01:32:21,353 --> 01:32:31,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the first download pack that has four weapons, a minigun, a noob tube, a sticky grenade, and a BFG, which we all know what BFG stands for.

1334
01:32:32,335 --> 01:32:36,476
[SPEAKER_02]: DLC number two is a deathmatch map.

1335
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:39,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's EDF base, LKR, and map three.

1336
01:32:39,317 --> 01:32:40,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just called map three.

1337
01:32:40,897 --> 01:32:48,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third pack is 15 new single player maps, arm wrestling, and the impregnator weapon, and a karaoke machine.

1338
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:50,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So hey.

1339
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you've pre-ordered the game, you get the first DLC for free.

1340
01:32:54,681 --> 01:33:00,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last news is in Batman Arkham City, you can play as Catwoman, and she gets her own storyline.

1341
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,584
[SPEAKER_05]: She better not be played by Halle Berry.

1342
01:33:02,704 --> 01:33:03,384
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks pretty hot.

1343
01:33:03,604 --> 01:33:05,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong, Halle Berry's hot, but that movie?

1344
01:33:05,505 --> 01:33:05,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Not hot.

1345
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:06,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1346
01:33:06,585 --> 01:33:07,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But she looks pretty hot.

1347
01:33:08,826 --> 01:33:09,126
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1348
01:33:10,623 --> 01:33:11,825
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1349
01:33:12,345 --> 01:33:12,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into what?

1350
01:33:12,986 --> 01:33:13,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Some Twitter topics now?

1351
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:15,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1352
01:33:15,149 --> 01:33:16,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1353
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:18,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And every week you guys can send us your tweets.

1354
01:33:19,455 --> 01:33:21,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Show us your tweets, as we like to say.

1355
01:33:21,818 --> 01:33:22,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And we read them.

1356
01:33:22,939 --> 01:33:23,881
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they don't suck.

1357
01:33:26,563 --> 01:33:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start off Twitter this week with... Oh, Fidelt61 tweeted us this, and I don't think we actually covered this elsewhere on the show.

1358
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:40,730
[SPEAKER_05]: TrekMovie.com reports that a video game set in the Star Trek movie universe is coming in 2012.

1359
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:42,851
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, did you hear about this?

1360
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:44,792
[SPEAKER_05]: This seems right up your alley here at Star Trek Online.

1361
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:48,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be set in the Abrams Trek universe.

1362
01:33:48,854 --> 01:33:52,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming to maybe bridge the new movie, because the new movie's out next year too, right?

1363
01:33:53,476 --> 01:33:53,716
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

1364
01:33:54,284 --> 01:33:54,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirk and Spock

1365
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:04,978
[SPEAKER_05]: ZQ

1366
01:34:35,338 --> 01:34:35,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Bridge Things.

1367
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:39,862
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also the first full Star Trek video game since 2007.

1368
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:52,871
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not counting Star Trek Online, but they would say that Star Trek Conquest, the eh game that came out from Bethesda, because that's what most people said about it, it will be coming out in 2012.

1369
01:34:56,048 --> 01:34:56,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check it out.

1370
01:34:56,748 --> 01:34:57,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck yeah.

1371
01:34:57,929 --> 01:34:58,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Star Wars enough.

1372
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:00,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Star Trek.

1373
01:35:01,212 --> 01:35:04,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an alt tab open with a Star Wars story that's coming later.

1374
01:35:04,054 --> 01:35:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1375
01:35:06,036 --> 01:35:14,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Essex22 tweeted us and said, Just curious what you guys might consider the best downloadable co-op PS3 title.

1376
01:35:14,864 --> 01:35:17,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to find something a friend and I can play online.

1377
01:35:17,986 --> 01:35:18,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Any suggestions?

1378
01:35:18,907 --> 01:35:21,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Best co-op downloadable title.

1379
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:24,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Portal 2 PC Download it on Steam

1380
01:35:49,176 --> 01:35:49,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Downloadable?

1381
01:35:49,716 --> 01:35:49,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1382
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard because I'm not sure what type of games you really like.

1383
01:36:14,161 --> 01:36:16,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And PS3 is also kind of limited.

1384
01:36:17,562 --> 01:36:19,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not as much stuff jumps to mind.

1385
01:36:19,703 --> 01:36:21,163
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have Quake 3 Arena.

1386
01:36:21,623 --> 01:36:23,484
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have kind of the same selection.

1387
01:36:23,504 --> 01:36:25,985
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have Perfect Dark and some of the same stuff that the Xbox does.

1388
01:36:27,305 --> 01:36:29,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The PixelJunk games are insanely popular.

1389
01:36:29,706 --> 01:36:31,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I would check those out too.

1390
01:36:31,907 --> 01:36:33,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So, things to think about.

1391
01:36:34,754 --> 01:36:55,968
[SPEAKER_05]: more tweets coming to us from TheBaconBits tweeted us with something the Nintendo controller spotted at E3 but then when I bring this up in a new window I'm like this is somebody trying to be lousy I think because what this is a picture of is I think it's just an N64 controller all taped up

1392
01:36:57,495 --> 01:37:00,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, somebody just posted an N64 controller, I think.

1393
01:37:00,217 --> 01:37:01,817
[SPEAKER_05]: A little lulzy there.

1394
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:06,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that would be kind of funny if they just used the 64 controller all over again, but I kind of doubt it.

1395
01:37:08,161 --> 01:37:12,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazernator tweets us, Usual drill, free TV shows on the PSN store.

1396
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:14,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's free movie rentals too.

1397
01:37:14,605 --> 01:37:15,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta email him offline.

1398
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:20,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about he set us up an account that has movies for me to watch.

1399
01:37:21,409 --> 01:37:23,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even downloaded the update.

1400
01:37:42,051 --> 01:37:43,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I will, though, probably this week.

1401
01:37:44,012 --> 01:37:44,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't forget.

1402
01:37:45,252 --> 01:37:46,112
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you download?

1403
01:37:47,232 --> 01:37:51,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded Super Stardust HD, and I have Infamous in my queue.

1404
01:37:51,993 --> 01:37:53,594
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't downloaded anything yet, I think.

1405
01:37:53,614 --> 01:37:55,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, do you get PSP games as well?

1406
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you get two PS3 and two PSP.

1407
01:37:57,675 --> 01:38:00,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even have... Nice, huh?

1408
01:38:00,635 --> 01:38:01,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna download something anyways.

1409
01:38:02,036 --> 01:38:02,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you should.

1410
01:38:02,736 --> 01:38:03,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Take up the opportunity.

1411
01:38:05,016 --> 01:38:07,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to some tweets from Blue Swim.

1412
01:38:08,123 --> 01:38:17,965
[SPEAKER_05]: heard OLR play the opening song to Katamari Damacy on the break and thought of Retro Force Go Orange Lounge Foodio question, what will you be snacking on during the E3 pressers?

1413
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:32,749

1415
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to read your tweets.

1416
01:38:42,555 --> 01:38:44,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to look into that Cover It Live software.

1417
01:38:44,737 --> 01:38:46,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if you could use that at your work day.

1418
01:38:46,619 --> 01:38:52,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, I don't even... I know, you don't think it's a big deal, but people love their Loki rage.

1419
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:58,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just gonna be... See, the problem is I have to watch them at work.

1420
01:38:59,089 --> 01:39:05,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem doing that because my boss is gone and his boss is gone, so... Well, it's not like it's not related to your job.

1421
01:39:05,334 --> 01:39:07,976
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the games you're gonna be selling at Christmas time.

1422
01:39:08,056 --> 01:39:08,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I think...

1423
01:39:08,897 --> 01:39:10,618
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have a right to watch this at work.

1424
01:39:10,658 --> 01:39:13,120
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is they let go so many people.

1425
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, stupid Nazis.

1426
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:17,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let me.

1427
01:39:17,543 --> 01:39:18,743
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'll just lock the door.

1428
01:39:18,763 --> 01:39:20,084
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they going to do?

1429
01:39:20,244 --> 01:39:20,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Lock the door?

1430
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:22,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll lock the door to the conference room.

1431
01:39:22,626 --> 01:39:24,307
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be watching it on nice HD TV.

1432
01:39:24,727 --> 01:39:25,087
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1433
01:39:25,567 --> 01:39:32,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft tweets us, What game or gaming-related news would truly surprise you if it happened on E3 this week?

1434
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:38,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we are going to get into E3 predictions a little later, but I'm going to allow this question because it's not talking about what do you think will happen.

1435
01:39:38,214 --> 01:39:41,815
[SPEAKER_05]: This is talking about what would surprise you if it happened.

1436
01:39:42,696 --> 01:39:44,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything that would truly surprise you if it happened?

1437
01:39:47,373 --> 01:40:07,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony doesn't fuck up that'd surprise me the F-Zero game on the Nintendo console I don't think it's gonna happen so I would say it would genuinely surprise me I would be tickled pink when I go down there on Thursday to pick up Bobby I might just have to rush the doors if the F-Zero game happens

1438
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... There's not really much that could be surprising to me.

1439
01:40:13,492 --> 01:40:16,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I'm going to this with really low expectations.

1440
01:40:17,739 --> 01:40:17,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1441
01:40:19,665 --> 01:40:26,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so hard to call things like that too because when I think of surprises, I think of things that literally come the fuck out of nowhere.

1442
01:40:27,133 --> 01:40:36,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say Gabe Newell getting up on stage at the Sony press conference and saying, Hey, by the way, I don't hate Sony anymore and we're going to integrate Steam and the PlayStation.

1443
01:40:36,902 --> 01:40:38,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a fucking surprise.

1444
01:40:38,804 --> 01:40:41,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't have called that.

1445
01:40:41,107 --> 01:40:42,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone could have.

1446
01:40:42,888 --> 01:40:59,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and Final Fantasy XIV, as lulzy as that came up, as that was two years ago, let us not forget when Jack Trenton was on stage and said, we're gonna be delivering Final Fantasy XIV, everybody was like, oh, he just fucked up, he meant XIII too, and no, it was fucking XIV was coming out already, even though XIII wasn't out.

1447
01:40:59,863 --> 01:41:02,785
[SPEAKER_04]: No, really it was XI, but you know, XI HD.

1448
01:41:02,845 --> 01:41:05,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprises are so hard to foresee.

1449
01:41:05,788 --> 01:41:05,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1450
01:41:07,401 --> 01:41:34,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say like a very strange partnership especially from Microsoft and I know that's so vague I know the return of Xbox Live experiences like 1 vs 100 I sadly think that shit is gone which pisses me off I think it was a great thing that they had but if they were to say hey we're bringing back the multiplayer game show type events the live events on Xbox that would truly surprise me

1451
01:41:36,209 --> 01:41:38,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the fuck are my Burger King Kinect games?

1452
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:45,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Burger King Kinect Part 2, that would be your... No, Burger King Kinect Part 1.

1453
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:46,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell are they?

1454
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:53,073
[SPEAKER_04]: They promised me that they're going to have some exclusive Burger King Kinect games.

1455
01:41:53,493 --> 01:41:55,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have yet to see these.

1456
01:41:56,234 --> 01:41:58,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I was all ready to buy them because they were going to be terrible.

1457
01:41:58,414 --> 01:42:15,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, the Nintendo console projects imagery, any type of projector built into the Nintendo, that would fucking surprise me because that is not happening the holodeck holodeck announced and it's coming to you from on live because nobody believed that shit would work either and look, there it is

1458
01:42:17,937 --> 01:42:19,338
[SPEAKER_05]: On Life presents the holodeck.

1459
01:42:19,738 --> 01:42:19,998
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1460
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:22,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to miss these tweets from Tiger Claw.

1461
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:22,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get to these.

1462
01:42:23,882 --> 01:42:27,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Top Gun and Days of Thunder to get Blu-ray game slash movie combos.

1463
01:42:27,865 --> 01:42:28,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about that?

1464
01:42:28,786 --> 01:42:29,586
[SPEAKER_05]: They're selling the combo packs.

1465
01:42:29,646 --> 01:42:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know about that.

1466
01:42:30,187 --> 01:42:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been selling those.

1467
01:42:31,108 --> 01:42:31,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you really?

1468
01:42:32,129 --> 01:42:33,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known about that for a while.

1469
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sound lame.

1470
01:42:35,371 --> 01:42:37,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, well, no, seriously, it's lame.

1471
01:42:37,493 --> 01:42:38,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what they're doing.

1472
01:42:38,314 --> 01:42:48,023
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing basically what they did with The Watchmen, where they take the really shitty, shitty PlayStation Network games that sold, like, garbage, and then they throw it in with the movie.

1473
01:42:48,404 --> 01:42:49,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what you're going to get.

1474
01:42:49,224 --> 01:42:55,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get the really shitty garbage Top Gun game and the really terrible, you know, Days of Thunder game.

1475
01:42:55,851 --> 01:42:56,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome!

1476
01:42:56,952 --> 01:42:58,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, at least you get a movie.

1477
01:42:59,397 --> 01:43:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta read this comment in chat Kai Judo in our chatroom says Big Brother on Xbox Live Arcade would be awesome If they don't make it, I will I've gotta say this I was walking through Target And I saw their Wii section of games And, excuse me, strawberry part I saw for sale on the Wii The Survivor game that's now available on the Wii And look, I'm a fan of reality trash TV And I do watch almost every episode of Survivor stuff And I picked up this box And I just started laughing at how horrible this game looked

1478
01:43:27,265 --> 01:43:30,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, have you seen the Amazing Race for the Wii?

1479
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:31,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that's garbage, too.

1480
01:43:31,969 --> 01:43:32,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure it is.

1481
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:42,237
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, like, actually, a Survivor game or something like that on Xbox Live Arcade and the party thing or whatever might not suck if they do it right.

1482
01:43:42,518 --> 01:43:44,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It could actually be really fucking interesting.

1483
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,262
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just don't trust anyone to get it right.

1484
01:43:48,762 --> 01:44:02,307
[SPEAKER_05]: because I look at this stuff that's on the Wii and I'm like oh the Wii game shows that work best are the minimalist ones like Wheel of Fortune that's pretty hard to fuck up Jeopardy again pretty hard to fuck up

1485
01:44:03,007 --> 01:44:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Pressure Luck.

1486
01:44:04,388 --> 01:44:05,609
[SPEAKER_05]: No whammies, no whammies, stop.

1487
01:44:05,649 --> 01:44:08,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, somehow, Game Show Network fucked it up when they revived it, but you know what I mean.

1488
01:44:08,952 --> 01:44:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic Pressure Luck is still gold.

1489
01:44:11,514 --> 01:44:11,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1490
01:44:12,915 --> 01:44:17,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Also from Tiger Claw, Penny Arcade comic to be adapted into a movie.

1491
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I had not heard about this.

1492
01:44:19,601 --> 01:44:20,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard anything about this?

1493
01:44:20,982 --> 01:44:22,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a spin-off.

1494
01:44:22,183 --> 01:44:25,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically... Well, since the games didn't work out so well.

1495
01:44:25,346 --> 01:44:26,447
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not even a spin-off.

1496
01:44:26,687 --> 01:44:30,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little three-panel comic that they did.

1497
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:32,732
[SPEAKER_02]: The story of the DivX player.

1498
01:44:32,972 --> 01:44:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not even, it's none of the Penny Arcade characters.

1499
01:44:35,733 --> 01:44:38,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically this kid who is... The new kid.

1500
01:44:38,855 --> 01:44:39,496
[SPEAKER_04]: The new kid, yeah.

1501
01:44:39,536 --> 01:44:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: He's moving, you know, normally it's moving to a new town.

1502
01:44:42,557 --> 01:44:43,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's moving to a new planet.

1503
01:44:43,838 --> 01:44:47,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And the planet has three quarters of the gravity that, you know, they had on Earth or whatever.

1504
01:44:48,301 --> 01:44:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm guessing he's kind of like, you know, super strong and fast or whatever.

1505
01:44:51,843 --> 01:44:55,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, you would be if you went to a planet with less gravity.

1506
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:57,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the guys behind... Everyone else would, too.

1507
01:44:57,206 --> 01:44:57,446
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1508
01:44:57,486 --> 01:44:57,526
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1509
01:44:58,166 --> 01:44:58,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1510
01:45:13,628 --> 01:45:24,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I would question how much are the Penny Arcade people going to actually be involved in this because they are pretty good writers and they write some really funny, hilarious, insightful comments and their commentary on gaming culture has always been really good.

1511
01:45:24,433 --> 01:45:32,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I read in this story here, Paramount has tapped Gary Witta, former PC Gamer Editor-in-Chief and Book of Eli screenwriter to pen the new kid and I roll my eyes.

1512
01:45:33,157 --> 01:45:35,058
[SPEAKER_04]: This has nothing to do with the Penny Arcade comic.

1513
01:45:35,138 --> 01:45:37,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happens to be this is a comic that they also made.

1514
01:45:38,559 --> 01:45:39,540
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the characters are in it.

1515
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,520
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the funny stuff's in it.

1516
01:45:40,580 --> 01:46:07,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that but I'm saying the Penny Arcade comic proves that they're good writers and I would like to see what they it's just like okay the South Park you know Trey and Matt are fucking hilarious I want to see the Book of Mormon play on that alone like it has nothing to do and I realize that that universe and South Park have nothing in common except recurring Mormon jokes over and over but I want to see that play based on the fact that I appreciate their work on the show and I think they're very good satirists that's what I'm getting at does that make sense

1517
01:46:08,411 --> 01:46:08,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope.

1518
01:46:08,892 --> 01:46:09,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1519
01:46:09,472 --> 01:46:10,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that does it for tweets tonight.

1520
01:46:10,653 --> 01:46:11,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1521
01:46:12,195 --> 01:46:23,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us more tweets for next week or send your tweets over to Bobby because he's going to be roaming the halls of E3 and he is your little eyeball that you can command to go look at things.

1522
01:46:23,425 --> 01:46:29,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, he did accept the challenge of going to find the giant stuffed animal at the Natsume booth and he will get Chibi Wolf.

1523
01:46:30,632 --> 01:46:30,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And a cow.

1524
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:38,202
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you're not getting in the car to Disneyland without swag for DarkSakura and Sky.

1525
01:46:38,882 --> 01:46:39,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably Dan, too.

1526
01:46:40,902 --> 01:46:41,583
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just for me.

1527
01:46:42,203 --> 01:46:44,043
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1528
01:46:45,004 --> 01:46:45,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm giving him such a hard time.

1529
01:46:46,224 --> 01:46:47,024
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1530
01:46:47,465 --> 01:46:48,025
[SPEAKER_05]: More news.

1531
01:46:48,185 --> 01:46:48,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty more news.

1532
01:46:48,985 --> 01:46:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And the mailbag and our E3 predictions just around the corner.

1533
01:46:52,463 --> 01:47:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: yes so Activision not to lose out on a money making opportunity they have decided to create Call of Duty Elite it is a paid digital platform being created by Beachhead Studios built around right now Modern Warfare 3 and now the service does have free aspects to it and this would include also like you know you know guild making and you know uh

1534
01:47:22,838 --> 01:47:24,239
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing videos and that kind of stuff.

1535
01:47:24,299 --> 01:47:26,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It also tracks your stats.

1536
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of it like the Halo waypoint almost a little bit.

1537
01:47:31,142 --> 01:47:42,648
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, of course, I guess they're saying part of the fee will go towards customer service operation that needs, I guess, they're supporting the back end for.

1538
01:47:42,668 --> 01:47:46,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're saying it's going to have a small monthly fee, maybe like $8 or something.

1539
01:47:47,331 --> 01:47:50,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.

1540
01:47:50,392 --> 01:47:51,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sounds...

1541
01:47:53,007 --> 01:48:22,271
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting I guess especially since a lot of the players for Call of Duty are really just online heavy and it's really community driven so it makes sense that they would be doing something like this also it's a way for them to sell more subscriptions and make money we make every month off of World of Warcraft from Blizzard how could we make money every month off our other big games yeah why bother having them share videos on YouTube for free when they can do it on our service

1542
01:48:23,755 --> 01:48:26,877
[SPEAKER_04]: and we could just take down all the videos on YouTube.

1543
01:48:27,638 --> 01:48:28,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think they would do that.

1544
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:38,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of it's still free, but they have a video out there that you can check out that has some of the features of it and stuff.

1545
01:48:38,926 --> 01:48:52,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds a little bit also, I don't know if anyone remembers, because it's been around for at least a few months now since Medal of Honor, but remember there's also the EA Gun Club or whatever?

1546
01:48:52,296 --> 01:48:52,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1547
01:48:53,257 --> 01:48:58,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got, you know, that kind of thing as well going on on the EA side.

1548
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:07,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I guess, I don't know, it makes sense that they're kind of doing this sort of stuff and I'm sure they're going to have like, you know, betas for, you know, paid members and stuff like that.

1549
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:11,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a way to get people, kind of think of it like the PlayStation Plus program or something like that.

1550
01:49:13,675 --> 01:49:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1551
01:49:14,315 --> 01:49:16,336
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're hardcore, then it's worth it to you.

1552
01:49:16,816 --> 01:49:20,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for those of us that don't get it, quote unquote, we just go, LOL, more money.

1553
01:49:20,757 --> 01:49:32,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even if you don't, like, for example, if you're not that hardcore into it, though, you can at least get some stuff out of the free portion of it.

1554
01:49:32,861 --> 01:49:37,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they have your career stats or all that stuff if you like the stat tracking.

1555
01:49:38,523 --> 01:49:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they even have the hot points on the map and stuff where most of the players are

1556
01:49:43,385 --> 01:50:10,216
[SPEAKER_05]: you know converging on and stuff like that so I don't know check out the free portion if it's not for you then you don't have to do it it's as simple as that you know we were talking a lot on Horde House today about $25 mounts and wow and why people buy them and you know some of us look at it and go why in the hell would you spend that money on a mount but for some people it's like pretty Barbie you know so you can't it's your money spend it on whatever you want

1557
01:50:12,426 --> 01:50:15,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, some details on the 3DS shop launch.

1558
01:50:16,048 --> 01:50:21,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Excitebike 3D is going to be the free game that is on the 3DS shop when it launches June 6th.

1559
01:50:21,851 --> 01:50:22,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow, right?

1560
01:50:23,492 --> 01:50:24,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap.

1561
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,293
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming out of nowhere.

1562
01:50:27,033 --> 01:50:27,214
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1563
01:50:27,294 --> 01:50:28,014
[SPEAKER_05]: You're shaking your finger.

1564
01:50:28,703 --> 01:50:32,085
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my finger, that means whoop-dee-shit.

1565
01:50:32,345 --> 01:50:34,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're twirling your finger, my bad.

1566
01:50:34,626 --> 01:50:41,050
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, the eShop launches this week, and it's going to be giving you Excitebike 3D free for 30 days.

1567
01:50:41,190 --> 01:50:43,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that will be fantastic in 3D.

1568
01:50:43,752 --> 01:50:46,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will fully utilize the power of the 3DS.

1569
01:50:46,273 --> 01:50:49,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the goddamn NES game with just the layers.

1570
01:50:49,815 --> 01:50:51,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what all those NES games are going to do.

1571
01:50:53,017 --> 01:50:56,859
[SPEAKER_05]: The background is one layer, and the sprites are a front layer, and it's, ooh, an effect.

1572
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:57,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1573
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:02,043
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, a lot of people will pick it up and play it and go, ooh.

1574
01:51:02,103 --> 01:51:03,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I will download it because it's free.

1575
01:51:03,484 --> 01:51:03,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's free.

1576
01:51:04,185 --> 01:51:11,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you think I'm buying any of your other fucking games, other NES games, and, you know, spending... Unfortunately, it doesn't have internet play.

1577
01:51:11,891 --> 01:51:12,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, how are they going to work that out?

1578
01:51:13,492 --> 01:51:17,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't the original Excitebike kind of borked because there was a load-save mode?

1579
01:51:17,855 --> 01:51:18,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they could fix that.

1580
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:20,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the original Excitebike was a disc game.

1581
01:51:21,378 --> 01:51:25,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they put it on the cartridge, like, it just flat out didn't work when they released it.

1582
01:51:25,021 --> 01:51:28,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but didn't they fix that, I thought, when it even came to the virtual console, though?

1583
01:51:28,824 --> 01:51:29,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1584
01:51:29,485 --> 01:51:30,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.

1585
01:51:31,285 --> 01:51:31,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe somebody in chat.

1586
01:51:31,946 --> 01:51:32,966
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we have a live chat room.

1587
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:34,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody will jump in here in a moment.

1588
01:51:34,367 --> 01:51:35,728
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, let me give you some more details.

1589
01:51:36,188 --> 01:51:38,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Excitebike 3D Classic will be free.

1590
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:41,531
[SPEAKER_05]: After 30 days, you know how much that will set you back?

1591
01:51:41,631 --> 01:51:42,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Six bucks.

1592
01:51:42,591 --> 01:51:43,792
[SPEAKER_05]: That's retarded.

1593
01:51:43,832 --> 01:51:44,873
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bunch of tacos.

1594
01:51:44,913 --> 01:51:48,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the $5 NES game plus a dollar premium.

1595
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,391
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1596
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:14,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Game Boy Ports, Super Mario Land, Alleyway, and Radar Mission will all be out on day one.

1597
01:52:15,254 --> 01:52:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: DSi and DSi XL owners will be able to transfer most of the DSiWare purchases to the system.

1598
01:52:21,056 --> 01:52:23,297
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some things that are not going to be transferable.

1599
01:52:23,617 --> 01:52:30,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe all of it has to do with licensed things like the Domo-kun games don't transfer over because they probably weren't licensed for more than the one console.

1600
01:52:30,461 --> 01:52:31,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they just came out over here.

1601
01:52:31,981 --> 01:52:32,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know they did either.

1602
01:52:32,902 --> 01:52:34,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It might only be a Japanese thing.

1603
01:52:34,282 --> 01:52:34,722
[SPEAKER_05]: IDK.

1604
01:52:35,443 --> 01:52:36,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, DSiWare.

1605
01:52:36,743 --> 01:52:38,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'd never really downloaded any DSiWare stuff.

1606
01:52:38,944 --> 01:52:39,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, though.

1607
01:52:39,584 --> 01:52:40,304
[SPEAKER_05]: This is huge.

1608
01:52:41,105 --> 01:52:45,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokédex 3D, a virtual compendium of Pokémon from black and white.

1609
01:52:46,267 --> 01:52:47,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a free download.

1610
01:52:48,227 --> 01:52:54,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It will allow you to just look up all the information in the world on the Pokémon 3D models.

1611
01:52:54,890 --> 01:53:12,274
[SPEAKER_05]: StreetPass functionality You unlock random Pokemon by exchanging data I don't know if that ties into BlackWire I don't think it does It's something to do with the Pokedex And QR code support You take a picture of your friend Set it as a background layer Snap a picture of a QR code to introduce a Pokemon

1612
01:53:13,769 --> 01:53:14,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what?

1613
01:53:15,631 --> 01:53:16,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1614
01:53:16,973 --> 01:53:21,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's also got the AR cards or whatever support so you can do the 3D models or whatever.

1615
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:31,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta admit, it sounds... I just can't wait for all the fucking mudkips because you know it's just a matter of time before we get Oprah introducing mudkips.

1616
01:53:32,382 --> 01:53:33,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Wily's Revenge

1617
01:53:49,662 --> 01:53:54,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirby's Dream Land, Baseball, and Phantasm, which was called Avenging Spirit over here.

1618
01:53:55,166 --> 01:54:01,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Downtown Special, Kunikun no Jikaigeki Daio Zenin Shugo.

1619
01:54:01,792 --> 01:54:04,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a River City Ransom spinoff with Samurais.

1620
01:54:05,535 --> 01:54:08,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in Japan... You just said the magic word, Kunio.

1621
01:54:08,835 --> 01:54:23,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in Japan on June 7th, Excitebike 3D, Mystery PI, 3D Block Breaking, and Xevious will be released as well, which I played at last year's E3, and it was the background on one layer and the sprites on the front layer.

1622
01:54:24,907 --> 01:54:51,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe gets Excitebike, Alleyway, Mario Land, and Tennis every Thursday will Europe see more games on the 3DS so there you go all those announcements out now so they don't have to talk about it at the press conference because they will be spending all of their time undoubtedly talking about not just the new console but I'm sure they will first parade out Skyward Sword for an update they'll parade out 3DS titles including the Mario title and maybe some surprises there on the 3DS and then

1623
01:54:52,285 --> 01:54:56,607
[SPEAKER_05]: easily half to two thirds will be about whatever this cafe thing is.

1624
01:54:58,928 --> 01:55:01,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop in our chat room says, look under your seat.

1625
01:55:01,989 --> 01:55:02,849
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mudkip.

1626
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:05,230
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a mudkip and you get a mudkip.

1627
01:55:05,650 --> 01:55:06,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's getting a mudkip.

1628
01:55:07,971 --> 01:55:08,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1629
01:55:08,911 --> 01:55:09,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a bee Pokemon?

1630
01:55:10,012 --> 01:55:10,632
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, forget it.

1631
01:55:12,096 --> 01:55:15,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about some other news for Nintendo?

1632
01:55:16,299 --> 01:55:23,284
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS Lite actually today has a price reduction.

1633
01:55:23,784 --> 01:55:25,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone down to $99.

1634
01:55:26,366 --> 01:55:27,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucks for all of you that bought one yesterday.

1635
01:55:29,028 --> 01:55:29,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1636
01:55:30,789 --> 01:55:33,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess they're just trying to clear out inventory.

1637
01:55:33,511 --> 01:55:33,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1638
01:55:36,533 --> 01:55:39,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But the games are still the games.

1639
01:55:39,996 --> 01:55:41,777
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not getting a price reduction.

1640
01:55:42,045 --> 01:55:43,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro tip, I saw them Foursquare.

1641
01:55:44,346 --> 01:55:46,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you stopped using Foursquare, but there is a pretty good deal on it still.

1642
01:55:47,187 --> 01:55:51,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Check into Toys R Us and you get, buy one, get one half off on DS and 3DS titles.

1643
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:52,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh.

1644
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:53,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro tip.

1645
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:54,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro tip.

1646
01:55:55,411 --> 01:55:55,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1647
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:58,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, which I don't think I got into it on this show.

1648
01:55:58,810 --> 01:56:01,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about it more on the Bobby call at the end of his show.

1649
01:56:02,291 --> 01:56:11,613
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, I'm convinced whatever this Nintendo controller is, their little touchscreen thing, um, I was saying on Bobby's show, you know, Nintendo's been making touchscreen controllers for about five, six years now.

1650
01:56:11,833 --> 01:56:12,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the DS.

1651
01:56:13,133 --> 01:56:16,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, the bottom half of that, that's gonna be your controller.

1652
01:56:16,513 --> 01:56:17,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a touchscreen with buttons.

1653
01:56:18,094 --> 01:56:19,214
[SPEAKER_05]: You've had one all along.

1654
01:56:21,134 --> 01:56:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be amazing if the DS would just work as a controller, but let's not.

1655
01:56:25,275 --> 01:56:25,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not.

1656
01:56:26,713 --> 01:56:35,949
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a special new button or there'll be something extra on this thing Oh, Rob Alright Moving on Loki

1657
01:56:36,782 --> 01:56:42,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Freestyle Games, you may remember them from such series as DJ Hero.

1658
01:56:42,908 --> 01:56:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thankfully they are not dead, which is good.

1659
01:56:48,674 --> 01:57:01,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently though, I guess they have confirmed 35 positions will be lost, but they still have a strong partnership with Activision, and they are currently working on a new innovative unannounced project.

1660
01:57:02,986 --> 01:57:31,535
[SPEAKER_05]: and it says of course they plan to share details about those projects or said project in the next coming months it's good to see that they're still around hopefully we'll get at least a DJ Hero 3 out of them yeah that would be cool I would appreciate that Rama's correcting me on something in the chat room nope you get your money back if there's a price drop within two weeks of purchase you get the difference back well now that really depends on what store you buy it at but okay fine I'll play your game here and say sucks for those that bought it 15 days ago

1661
01:57:34,856 --> 01:57:36,797
[SPEAKER_04]: But why are you buying a DS now?

1662
01:57:36,877 --> 01:57:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, buy something else.

1663
01:57:39,919 --> 01:57:42,800
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3DS will slowly add value before Christmas.

1664
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Before Christmas, you're going to see... And there will be... Like, you're going to probably see the Netflix on 3DS in action and some of this at the...

1665
01:57:51,605 --> 01:57:55,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 3DS is going to see a lot more added value before Christmas time.

1666
01:57:55,267 --> 01:57:56,488
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just us early adopters.

1667
01:57:56,968 --> 01:58:03,991
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Street Fighter, Pilotwings, Ridge Racer, IDK, Steel Diver, and that's Zelda.

1668
01:58:04,072 --> 01:58:05,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Zelda.

1669
01:58:05,772 --> 01:58:07,413
[SPEAKER_05]: A game we played 10 years ago.

1670
01:58:08,774 --> 01:58:09,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It was overrated then.

1671
01:58:10,075 --> 01:58:14,097
[SPEAKER_04]: For the love of God, publishers, stop making your old games.

1672
01:58:15,217 --> 01:58:18,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Making an old game HD is not a fucking new game.

1673
01:58:19,865 --> 01:58:22,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Who remembers a company called Origin?

1674
01:58:22,707 --> 01:58:23,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember this company?

1675
01:58:23,768 --> 01:58:27,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Origin, I believe, didn't they have the Ultima games back in the day?

1676
01:58:27,891 --> 01:58:31,794
[SPEAKER_02]: The only Origin I know of is the cosmetic company.

1677
01:58:32,555 --> 01:58:34,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Origin, yeah, they did the Ultima games, which was huge.

1678
01:58:35,197 --> 01:58:38,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this, EA bought Origin Systems some time ago.

1679
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 20 years ago they bought it.

1680
01:58:40,041 --> 01:58:40,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a long time ago.

1681
01:58:40,761 --> 01:58:48,207
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bringing back the brand, so to speak, or at least the name, with a direct-to-consumer gaming platform.

1682
01:58:48,547 --> 01:58:48,587
[SPEAKER_05]: E.A.

1683
01:58:48,607 --> 01:58:48,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Store

1684
01:59:08,118 --> 01:59:13,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars The Old Republic is supposedly going to be downloadable only on Origin.

1685
01:59:13,963 --> 01:59:19,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Origin will have its own application, which you can find, connect with friends, blah, blah, blah, download, play PC games.

1686
01:59:19,889 --> 01:59:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they're doing everything that Steam's doing, trying to get a little more competition in space because let's face it, the games for Windows Live thing really hasn't, you know, just...

1687
01:59:29,358 --> 01:59:31,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Broke through like I think Microsoft was hoping it would.

1688
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:35,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the service is also going to work on mobile devices.

1689
01:59:36,142 --> 01:59:40,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Scrabble, mobile versions of Battlefield 3, all of that will be on the...

1690
01:59:42,416 --> 01:59:43,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Origin Store as well.

1691
01:59:44,317 --> 01:59:48,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Ultima, randomly, I did read an article that Ultima 4 is now free to play online.

1692
01:59:49,538 --> 01:59:54,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to go back and play a classic RPG, it's ass hard too.

1693
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,521
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really a difficult title.

1694
01:59:57,081 --> 02:00:00,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The NES version really dumbed it up and it still was really hard.

1695
02:00:00,602 --> 02:00:01,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I would check out Ultima 4.

1696
02:00:02,523 --> 02:00:04,123
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what RPGs were when I was a kid.

1697
02:00:05,404 --> 02:00:05,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And we liked it.

1698
02:00:08,277 --> 02:00:14,006
[SPEAKER_05]: More information, I'm sure, at EA's press conference, which is at 1230 Pacific, 330 Eastern on Monday.

1699
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:19,013
[SPEAKER_05]: on right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

1700
02:00:19,153 --> 02:00:29,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will dive in, pick a few of her favorites and read them right now on the air.

1701
02:00:29,395 --> 02:00:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got a bunch, so I'm only going to read four and I picked them at random and I didn't pick any that were by the same person.

1702
02:00:35,296 --> 02:00:35,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1703
02:00:35,956 --> 02:00:37,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my criteria.

1704
02:00:37,476 --> 02:00:39,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not getting read, don't worry, I probably...

1705
02:00:40,857 --> 02:00:42,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And you shouldn't get butt hurt if you're not getting read.

1706
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:47,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't want to sound like we have ego here, but we do have a nice listenership.

1707
02:00:47,504 --> 02:00:52,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate everybody that listens, but when you all email us at once, we can't read it all or it would be a seven hour show.

1708
02:00:52,929 --> 02:00:58,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing personal, but I would like to say that if you've got something to send us, just do it in one email.

1709
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:00,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's really long.

1710
02:01:01,538 --> 02:01:02,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I would prefer the one email.

1711
02:01:03,706 --> 02:01:05,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one comes from Holly.

1712
02:01:06,107 --> 02:01:08,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly how stupid is this guy who complained about it?

1713
02:01:08,468 --> 02:01:10,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually about the Portal 2 being offending.

1714
02:01:11,489 --> 02:01:13,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, GLaDOS is the villain.

1715
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:14,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheatley is the villain.

1716
02:01:14,891 --> 02:01:16,992
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to make you feel bad and insult you.

1717
02:01:17,932 --> 02:01:22,014
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband is 200 pounds overweight and he found the fat jokes absolutely hilarious.

1718
02:01:22,154 --> 02:01:22,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1719
02:01:22,414 --> 02:01:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they are villains.

1720
02:01:49,284 --> 02:01:58,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I think too, God, this was an ugly story last week, but yeah, I mean, GLaDOS was very, you couldn't take GLaDOS seriously.

1721
02:01:59,844 --> 02:02:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1722
02:02:00,565 --> 02:02:02,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the way the character was built.

1723
02:02:02,686 --> 02:02:07,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wheatley was designed to be the dumbest moron that ever lived, end quote.

1724
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:10,913
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that whole thing was just sensationalist media.

1725
02:02:11,313 --> 02:02:12,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just unfortunate.

1726
02:02:12,274 --> 02:02:14,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, people are going to get offended, but you know what?

1727
02:02:14,756 --> 02:02:15,917
[SPEAKER_05]: We all get offended at weird things.

1728
02:02:16,157 --> 02:02:21,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They were completely the news, quote, professionals.

1729
02:02:21,341 --> 02:02:22,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they ever respond to you, by the way?

1730
02:02:22,602 --> 02:02:22,823
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1731
02:02:23,043 --> 02:02:23,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.

1732
02:02:23,863 --> 02:02:24,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly unprofessional.

1733
02:02:26,085 --> 02:02:27,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't believe anything that they say.

1734
02:02:28,247 --> 02:02:29,088
[SPEAKER_05]: More emails.

1735
02:02:30,476 --> 02:02:31,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes through the website.

1736
02:02:32,397 --> 02:02:34,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to get your opinions on some things.

1737
02:02:34,718 --> 02:02:37,940
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the original Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark?

1738
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:42,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself enjoy these games quite a bit because I'm a big fan of first-person shooters.

1739
02:02:42,382 --> 02:02:44,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work, sincerely, CD Thunder.

1740
02:02:45,903 --> 02:02:48,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they both made me throw up.

1741
02:02:49,585 --> 02:02:50,626
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1742
02:03:10,496 --> 02:03:12,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldeneye was simply a landmark title.

1743
02:03:12,578 --> 02:03:14,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It did so much for first-person shooters.

1744
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:21,446
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they tried to imitate it on the Wii and try to hit gold twice, but it just wasn't the same.

1745
02:03:22,567 --> 02:03:25,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the unfortunate thing with a lot of these retro updates.

1746
02:03:25,089 --> 02:03:25,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not the same.

1747
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:28,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first Goldeneye came out, what, 15 years ago?

1748
02:03:28,452 --> 02:03:29,132
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not that long.

1749
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, whenever the movie was out.

1750
02:03:30,353 --> 02:03:32,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the late 90s.

1751
02:03:32,956 --> 02:03:34,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's the difference between...

1752
02:03:37,296 --> 02:03:38,217
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1753
02:03:58,476 --> 02:03:58,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1754
02:03:59,476 --> 02:04:00,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got another one through the website.

1755
02:04:02,457 --> 02:04:03,737
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Calru.

1756
02:04:03,757 --> 02:04:08,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that the news is trying to blame the game... Okay, this is probably more about the portal thing.

1757
02:04:09,939 --> 02:04:17,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that the news is trying to blame the game for poor dialogue and DarkSakura was blaming the news channel for their poor investigation, but neither of you guys really looked at the real issue.

1758
02:04:18,061 --> 02:04:19,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the rating...

1759
02:04:20,962 --> 02:04:22,942
[SPEAKER_02]: This person is using such horrible grammar.

1760
02:04:22,962 --> 02:04:24,023
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no punctuation in here.

1761
02:04:24,183 --> 02:04:25,743
[SPEAKER_02]: There's none but one ellipse.

1762
02:04:26,163 --> 02:04:26,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway.

1763
02:04:27,324 --> 02:04:38,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game was rated E10+, and should have been rated T. So a lot of the concepts in the game seem to be a little over the head of a 10-year-old, so let's stop blaming games and blame the rating system.

1764
02:04:39,228 --> 02:04:43,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, the rating system is shit anyway, but I knew what adoption was when I was 10.

1765
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, you know...

1766
02:04:48,671 --> 02:04:49,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

1767
02:04:49,492 --> 02:04:58,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think the emailer has a wee bit of a point, but at the same time, it's no rating board's responsibility to fill the role of a parent.

1768
02:04:59,618 --> 02:05:00,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

1769
02:05:01,799 --> 02:05:02,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really tough call.

1770
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I get this perspective a lot.

1771
02:05:06,382 --> 02:05:15,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though you might have known what it was when you were 10, I can see where maybe there wasn't enough warning that, hey, there might be some jokes that are going to go over a 10-year-old's head.

1772
02:05:16,608 --> 02:05:19,410
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe this game really should be only played by teens and up.

1773
02:05:19,450 --> 02:05:20,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I gotta be honest.

1774
02:05:20,731 --> 02:05:22,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I let my kid play Portal?

1775
02:05:23,053 --> 02:05:23,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.

1776
02:05:23,534 --> 02:05:23,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1777
02:05:24,034 --> 02:05:25,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think it's really dangerous.

1778
02:05:25,455 --> 02:05:28,878
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's... But then again, I don't have these sensitivities to watch out for.

1779
02:05:28,898 --> 02:05:31,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a baby to stop crying by playing Portal 2.

1780
02:05:32,041 --> 02:05:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1781
02:05:33,021 --> 02:05:41,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's cousin was over here and her baby was crying in her lap so I asked if I could hold him and then I held him while I was playing Portal 2 in my lap and he thought it was amazing.

1782
02:05:41,548 --> 02:05:42,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way as far as this email goes.

1783
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:44,751
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fair argument.

1784
02:05:44,991 --> 02:05:46,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not sure I agree.

1785
02:05:46,312 --> 02:05:48,854
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's a valid counterpoint.

1786
02:05:49,235 --> 02:05:49,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you that.

1787
02:05:50,484 --> 02:05:51,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it.

1788
02:05:51,385 --> 02:05:54,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I honestly think that they should just rate them the way they do movies.

1789
02:05:54,726 --> 02:06:06,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people would get it because apparently, I honestly think that a lot of people, especially ones who are not gamers and that are parents now, don't want to understand it.

1790
02:06:07,152 --> 02:06:10,754
[SPEAKER_02]: They want other people to do their thinking for them and that's not acceptable.

1791
02:06:11,395 --> 02:06:15,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, if you've got to answer a difficult question because you didn't do any research into the game, guess what?

1792
02:06:15,777 --> 02:06:16,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on you.

1793
02:06:18,035 --> 02:06:18,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Tricky Tricky.

1794
02:06:19,355 --> 02:06:20,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there more to the email?

1795
02:06:21,116 --> 02:06:21,536
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one more.

1796
02:06:22,036 --> 02:06:22,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, one more.

1797
02:06:23,997 --> 02:06:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one through the website.

1798
02:06:25,917 --> 02:06:29,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I was picking the short ones.

1799
02:06:29,378 --> 02:06:35,920
[SPEAKER_02]: A few shows ago you picked this old game called Phantasmagoria.

1800
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:38,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember playing it when I was 15 and absolutely loved it.

1801
02:06:38,941 --> 02:06:41,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon after that I played Gabriel Knight, The Beast Within.

1802
02:06:41,641 --> 02:06:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: After thinking back of those games, I started to wonder if there are any recent games out there that are point-click horrors.

1803
02:06:47,703 --> 02:06:51,426
[SPEAKER_02]: All I've seen so far are mysteries and unfortunately it's more aimed at children.

1804
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:52,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my horror and gore.

1805
02:06:52,807 --> 02:06:53,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad face.

1806
02:06:53,407 --> 02:06:54,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Toodles, Syl.

1807
02:06:55,148 --> 02:06:55,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Syl.

1808
02:06:55,969 --> 02:06:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1809
02:06:56,789 --> 02:06:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Syl lived in Amsterdam.

1810
02:06:59,831 --> 02:07:07,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if she was in the capital of Holland, but she was in Dutch country and then she moved to Britain not that long ago.

1811
02:07:07,276 --> 02:07:09,698
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not in London, but she's in another part of the country.

1812
02:07:10,298 --> 02:07:12,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we had her on Horde House a couple weeks ago.

1813
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:15,502
[SPEAKER_05]: She hosts the Girls Gone Wow podcast, which is a lot of fun.

1814
02:07:15,862 --> 02:07:17,023
[SPEAKER_05]: You should go on that show.

1815
02:07:18,144 --> 02:07:20,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Except at the time they tape, it's probably like 3 a.m.

1816
02:07:20,988 --> 02:07:21,428
[SPEAKER_05]: over here.

1817
02:07:22,389 --> 02:07:25,934
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do it on a weekend and I don't have school the next day, then whatever.

1818
02:07:26,134 --> 02:07:27,716
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, back to the question itself.

1819
02:07:28,297 --> 02:07:29,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Phantasmagoria.

1820
02:07:29,979 --> 02:07:31,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there really hasn't been a game like that in a long time.

1821
02:07:31,802 --> 02:07:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: The Silent Hill game on Wii was kind of point-and-clicky, but not quite.

1822
02:07:36,327 --> 02:07:37,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna do a quick bit of research, hold on

1823
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:59,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, if you want to go to the console side, I mean, Silent Hill games still have the gore and the fun stuff.

1824
02:07:59,362 --> 02:08:01,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just Silent Hill, but Resident Evil.

1825
02:08:02,324 --> 02:08:05,065
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the other big horror franchise series we have?

[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Space This is actually at pointandclickgames.com You know what else actually, remember The Room?

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Salacious Pop is jumping up and down in chat I have to say this, Amnesia, because I was thinking of that game too I'm like, what's that game that was on Steam on sale?

1832
02:08:37,588 --> 02:08:46,177
[SPEAKER_05]: But you had Amnesia Yeah, Amnesia is supposed to be a scary as hell title that's on PCs I would check out Amnesia for sure And that's a point and click?

1833
02:08:48,086 --> 02:08:49,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the little flash game that's called The Room?

1834
02:08:50,292 --> 02:08:51,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Crimson Room?

1835

02:08:55,324 --> 02:08:56,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, one more time.

1838
02:08:56,086 --> 02:08:56,948

02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a whole other type of I'll see if I can find it in the chat room but that one, it wasn't really so much of a scary game per se but it was sort of like kind of imagining yourself in that situation made it frightening that's what I thought was interesting about it I love that game by the way, don't shit your pants, it's a great game is that it for emails?

1841
02:09:49,951 --> 02:09:51,692

02:09:57,559 --> 02:09:58,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be butthurt if you don't get through, though.

1844
02:09:59,120 --> 02:09:59,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.

1845
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:00,601
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also the forums.

1846
02:10:00,761 --> 02:10:03,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody freaking posts on the Orange Lounge Radio forums, and I think we need to fix that.

1847
02:10:03,603 --> 02:10:05,884
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make that our mission this year to have some hopping forums.

1848
02:10:06,444 --> 02:10:08,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to encourage more discussion on the forums.

1849
02:10:08,906 --> 02:10:09,746
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to work on that.

1850
02:10:10,907 --> 02:10:12,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's it for the mailbag, yes?

1851
02:10:13,949 --> 02:10:20,173
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to get into a game tonight, and we're going to do this with predictions.

1852
02:10:20,353 --> 02:10:23,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to do this in the style of an old board game called Taboo.

1853
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the game Taboo?

1854
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:31,966
[SPEAKER_05]: In Taboo, there were certain phrases that you wanted to say, but there were certain things that you didn't want to say.

1855
02:10:32,487 --> 02:10:35,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So the OLR hosts, we're going to go around right now and give our predictions.

1856
02:10:36,210 --> 02:10:42,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Five things you will see at E3 and five things you won't see at E3.

1857
02:10:43,055 --> 02:11:03,589
[SPEAKER_05]: so for everything that you will see at E3 that is indeed announced that host will earn a point now see we can't tally this up till later in the week but for everything that you won't see that they do say there's going to be a buzz and that host will lose the point and the host with the most points by whenever we have another show next Sunday after next will win tacos

1858
02:11:05,174 --> 02:11:05,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have to buy themselves.

1860
02:11:08,215 --> 02:11:08,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1861
02:11:08,815 --> 02:11:11,336
[SPEAKER_05]: No, if it's not me, I will buy tacos.

1862

[SPEAKER_05]: New Super Mario Bros.

02:11:32,496 --> 02:11:32,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Sequel Announced

[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

1872
02:12:17,225 --> 02:12:18,926

02:12:42,023 --> 02:12:43,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony will talk about network security.

1874
02:12:43,746 --> 02:12:43,966

[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about how they're the safest.

1878
02:12:52,398 --> 02:12:54,101
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Sony auto fellatio.

1879
02:12:57,717 --> 02:12:58,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

1880
02:12:59,259 --> 02:13:01,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, something you will see.

1881
02:13:01,863 --> 02:13:04,267
[SPEAKER_05]: A new Grand Theft Auto sequel will be announced.

1882
02:13:05,549 --> 02:13:07,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, playing it very safe.

1883

[SPEAKER_05]: A new Grand Theft Auto sequel announced.

1885
02:13:09,855 --> 02:13:10,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1886
02:13:11,718 --> 02:13:12,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go out on a limb.

1887
02:13:12,839 --> 02:13:13,500
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I'm going crazy.

1888
02:13:14,261 --> 02:13:22,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna say that the hardcore Wii title that is going to get you back to playing Nintendo I think it's gonna be Star Fox.

1889
02:13:23,013 --> 02:13:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a new Star Fox game will be announced for the new whatever console it is.

1890
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:29,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if the whole...

1891
02:13:30,442 --> 02:13:33,203
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura They're going to verify the name of the new PSP The what?

1892
02:14:00,146 --> 02:14:02,467
[SPEAKER_02]: of the new handheld PlayStation.

1893
02:14:02,607 --> 02:14:04,128
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to verify the name.

1894
02:14:04,648 --> 02:14:04,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1895
02:14:04,888 --> 02:14:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: This is already leaked.

1896
02:14:06,489 --> 02:14:13,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said they were going to announce it before I realized that it had been put out.

1897
02:14:14,472 --> 02:14:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said they're going to verify it.

1898
02:14:16,113 --> 02:14:16,373
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1899
02:14:17,614 --> 02:14:39,496
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm going to have to send you the list so you can yeah you'll have to send it to me so you can pile it and Loki you'll have to do that too IDK and if you guys want to throw out your ideas in chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com things you think will happen at E3 Loki I think that there will be a minor price drop on the Xbox 360 console and Kinect hardware announced

1900
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:42,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So like a bundle thing?

1901
02:14:42,842 --> 02:14:46,806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm saying they're going to drop the price of the system and they're also going to drop the price of the Kinect.

1902
02:14:48,528 --> 02:14:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting, okay.

1903
02:14:50,391 --> 02:14:51,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to get more people on board?

1904
02:14:51,712 --> 02:14:56,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly, because that's what they're pushing, so it makes sense that they would try to drop the price of the console down.

1905
02:14:57,799 --> 02:14:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1906
02:14:57,959 --> 02:14:59,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the last drop was...

1907
02:15:01,482 --> 02:15:02,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1908
02:15:17,029 --> 02:15:43,313
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely not Star Wars because we've already had that and I think this time they've already done like some of the other big franchises so I think this time Soul Calibur 5 will have Capcom and I'm saying this because of the whole kind of we see them working together in Tekken cross Street Fighter and Street Fighter cross Tekken the one that comes to mind right away Dante I think Dante will be a character in Soul Calibur 5 that's my prediction okay two more Dark Sakura

1909
02:15:45,759 --> 02:15:47,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine was more Portal 2 download content.

1910
02:15:48,981 --> 02:15:51,083
[SPEAKER_05]: More Portal 2 download content.

1911
02:15:52,124 --> 02:15:52,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1912
02:15:52,844 --> 02:15:55,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, like Valve will show off the user creator stuff?

1913
02:15:56,247 --> 02:15:57,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there'd be that.

1914
02:15:57,288 --> 02:15:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe new maps that they did.

1915
02:16:02,291 --> 02:16:02,972
[SPEAKER_10]: More fun.

1916
02:16:03,432 --> 02:16:03,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1917
02:16:04,553 --> 02:16:04,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1918
02:16:06,575 --> 02:16:09,837
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of retarded, but new Animal Crossing game announced.

1919
02:16:10,638 --> 02:16:13,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so you think that's going to be the Nintendo title that comes out the gate?

1920
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:14,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be a 3DS title for sure.

1921
02:16:17,453 --> 02:16:19,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you think it'll be a 3DS thing?

1922
02:16:19,294 --> 02:16:19,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1923
02:16:20,314 --> 02:16:20,654
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1924
02:16:22,735 --> 02:16:23,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1925
02:16:24,335 --> 02:16:40,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say that Valve will show Defense of the Ancients 2, which I think is a risky pick for me because I think Valve has pretty much said they're not showing anything already, but I kind of think this game is ready to be shown more of because it's kind of their next big thing they've got in the pipeline, so I think Defense of the Ancients 2 is going to show up at E3.

1926
02:16:41,761 --> 02:16:44,022
[SPEAKER_05]: and one more prediction to round out the five.

1927
02:16:44,603 --> 02:16:45,223
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1928
02:16:45,343 --> 02:16:46,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I broke from IRC.

1929
02:16:47,124 --> 02:16:47,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Darn it.

1930
02:16:47,764 --> 02:16:48,284
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1931
02:16:50,566 --> 02:16:55,288
[SPEAKER_02]: There was... Well, Loki already said it, but it was on my list, so I'm going to say it anyway.

1932
02:16:55,328 --> 02:16:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: An Xbox 360 price drop.

1933
02:16:59,270 --> 02:16:59,650
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

1934
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:01,811
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody's list is duplicated, that's fine.

1935
02:17:02,931 --> 02:17:07,113
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I will say one of the things that you said will show at E3, I have in my will not.

1936
02:17:07,614 --> 02:17:08,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is going to get interesting.

1937
02:17:09,615 --> 02:17:10,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, um...

1938
02:17:12,046 --> 02:17:14,068
[SPEAKER_05]: My... Oh, sorry, Loki, you're fifth and final.

1939
02:17:15,089 --> 02:17:21,134
[SPEAKER_04]: DS Titles on the new Nintendo system will be on their virtual console or download service, whatever the hell they're going to call it.

1940
02:17:21,674 --> 02:17:22,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Say it, virtual console.

1941
02:17:23,036 --> 02:17:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DS Titles on new Nintendo system, virtual console.

1942
02:17:29,581 --> 02:17:37,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Blackwolf posted in chat a picture from E3, and I saw those same creatures in what Miklatov sent me.

1943
02:17:37,288 --> 02:17:38,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the Rage creatures.

1944
02:17:39,028 --> 02:17:44,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw there was a thing on Kotaku where they were all boxed up or whatever, and they're setting them up.

1945
02:17:44,694 --> 02:17:45,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1946
02:17:46,115 --> 02:17:50,039
[SPEAKER_05]: My last one on my list is, I'm going to go for kind of an easy one.

1947
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:52,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo will demo 3D Netflix.

1948
02:17:53,163 --> 02:17:58,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a big thing that they're going to be showing at E3, and they're going to be showing 3D Netflix.

1949
02:17:58,528 --> 02:17:59,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we disconnect?

1950
02:18:00,630 --> 02:18:01,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we did.

1951
02:18:01,351 --> 02:18:02,252
[SPEAKER_05]: My Win app has crashed.

1952
02:18:03,793 --> 02:18:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still on IRC Hold on, we're going to keep recording for the sake of the podcast But we are not broadcasting right now Hold on, just keep going I think I'm still up No, I know you guys are connected The Winamp crashed over here That's what's wrong I'll say something in the chat room Okay Good old live radio and the pitfalls of it Okay, we should be connected again

1953
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:31,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So to recap, do you have all your five written down?

1954
02:18:31,881 --> 02:18:34,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's recap the five things we think will happen.

1955
02:18:34,523 --> 02:18:35,723
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, your list again.

1956
02:18:36,744 --> 02:18:49,311
[SPEAKER_02]: A Halo game for Kinect, network security from Sony, verifying the name of the PSP, or whatever, NGP, Vitamin, more Portal 2 download content, and Xbox 360 price drop.

1957
02:18:50,191 --> 02:18:52,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Loki, the five things you said will happen.

1958
02:18:53,073 --> 02:19:17,906
[SPEAKER_04]: In no particular order, minor press drop on the Xbox 360 console and Kinect hardware, a new Animal Crossing game announced, a new Grand Theft Auto game announced, and a new Super Mario game announced, and I mean like a new Super Mario Brothers, because that's kind of confusing and redundant, and then DS titles on the new Nintendo system virtual console.

1959
02:19:18,516 --> 02:19:20,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then my list of five things you will see.

1960
02:19:21,298 --> 02:19:23,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 3 announced for a console.

1961
02:19:23,899 --> 02:19:26,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Fox announced as the hardcore Wii title.

1962
02:19:26,761 --> 02:19:29,342
[SPEAKER_05]: The Soul Calibur V bonus characters are Capcom inspired.

1963
02:19:29,402 --> 02:19:30,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Think Dante.

1964
02:19:30,703 --> 02:19:34,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Valve will show Defense of the Ancients 2 and Nintendo will demo 3D Netflix.

1965
02:19:34,585 --> 02:19:37,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's go to the five things you won't see.

1966
02:19:37,227 --> 02:19:40,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So if these things are said, the host loses a point.

1967
02:19:40,509 --> 02:19:42,070
[SPEAKER_05]: They get buzzed like in Taboo.

1968
02:19:42,810 --> 02:19:43,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1969
02:19:44,111 --> 02:19:47,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what the five things that we're putting on the card that they won't say.

1970
02:19:47,372 --> 02:19:48,593
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what's your first one?

1971
02:19:48,813 --> 02:19:50,113
[SPEAKER_02]: No Final Fantasy VII Remake.

1972
02:19:51,574 --> 02:19:52,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very safe bet.

1973
02:19:52,974 --> 02:19:57,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone puts that on the I want to see it list every year and it's not going to happen.

1974
02:19:57,476 --> 02:19:57,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1975
02:19:58,236 --> 02:19:58,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good one.

1976
02:20:00,396 --> 02:20:03,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so yep, no Final Fantasy VII.

1977
02:20:04,081 --> 02:20:04,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1978
02:20:05,283 --> 02:20:08,848
[SPEAKER_05]: This would make me sad, but no Excite Truck sequel.

1979
02:20:10,270 --> 02:20:11,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not going to happen.

1980
02:20:12,513 --> 02:20:17,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually put on my list, Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outage directly.

1981
02:20:18,757 --> 02:20:19,877
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your next one.

1982
02:20:45,345 --> 02:20:50,029
[SPEAKER_02]: My next one is, and this makes me sad, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 will not be announced.

1983
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:52,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1984
02:20:53,271 --> 02:20:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1985
02:20:55,673 --> 02:21:03,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say the new Nintendo I don't even know if they're going to announce the price, but the new Nintendo system will not be under $250.

1986
02:21:06,457 --> 02:21:08,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a good guess.

1987
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,622
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think it will cost?

1988
02:21:09,762 --> 02:21:09,622
$299?

1989
02:21:10,102 --> 02:21:11,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be $299.

1990
02:21:11,605 --> 02:21:13,307
[SPEAKER_04]: The controllers are going to be a lot more expensive.

1991
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:17,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Prices are going to be difficult, but they're going to have to justify it somehow.

1992
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the controllers will be $79.

1993
02:21:19,501 --> 02:21:19,201
$79.99.

1994
02:21:19,681 --> 02:21:23,244
[SPEAKER_05]: $79.99 and they're going to be half a DS.

1995
02:21:25,886 --> 02:21:29,268
[SPEAKER_05]: My list, my number two thing on things you won't see, Killer Instinct.

1996
02:21:29,489 --> 02:21:29,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1997
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:33,231
[SPEAKER_05]: File that in the fanboy wank category too.

1998
02:21:33,512 --> 02:21:36,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's been rumblings this year that it's supposed to come back.

1999
02:21:36,254 --> 02:21:36,494
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2000
02:21:37,214 --> 02:21:37,355
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2001
02:21:37,995 --> 02:21:41,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy your Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter remakes and all this because that's as good as it's going to get.

2002
02:21:42,358 --> 02:21:42,819
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

2003
02:21:43,499 --> 02:21:45,080
[SPEAKER_02]: No new Microsoft or Sega system.

2004
02:21:46,121 --> 02:21:46,662
Ha ha ha ha!

2005
02:21:48,197 --> 02:21:54,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, people, there's rumors every year about a Microsoft portable, so DarkSakura's saying, nope, not happening.

2006
02:21:55,567 --> 02:21:55,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

2007
02:21:57,830 --> 02:22:02,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... I would have to say probably that they're...

2008
02:22:04,711 --> 02:22:12,441
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not going to be the 1 vs. 100 type thing anymore.

2009
02:22:12,781 --> 02:22:16,146
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to announce some sort of community gaming type thing.

2010
02:22:16,306 --> 02:22:17,167
[SPEAKER_05]: No more community games.

2011
02:22:17,848 --> 02:22:18,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

2012
02:22:20,244 --> 02:22:42,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna say that one thing you won't see a Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3 you will see big pushes on 13 2 instead they're gonna just it's not that they're gonna try to erase that 14 ever happened but they're gonna push 13 2 before they try to revisit 14 I think DarkSakura Sega will make a good Sonic game that's something you won't see yep

2013
02:22:45,057 --> 02:22:45,617
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.

2014
02:22:46,298 --> 02:22:48,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be hard to see.

2015
02:22:48,739 --> 02:22:50,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to see what the feedback is on the show floor, I suppose.

2016
02:22:51,421 --> 02:22:51,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki?

2017
02:22:54,123 --> 02:22:56,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not see a new Dance Masters game.

2018
02:22:59,306 --> 02:23:00,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

2019
02:23:01,988 --> 02:23:05,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you go so far as to say you will not see a non-DDR Konami dance game?

2020
02:23:08,487 --> 02:23:34,379
[SPEAKER_05]: uh a non-DDR Konami dance game yes I would say I go that far okay all right uh funny enough my number four is about a music game as well I don't think you're gonna see a DJ game from Harmonix and when I say DJ game from Harmonix I mean one that involves a turntable controller because it could be that the new obviously whatever Harmonix makes is going to be music based but I don't want that interpretation to be too loose I'm talking turntable and keys not happening

2021
02:23:35,399 --> 02:23:38,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Harmonix is going to go somewhere new with something you haven't thought of.

2022
02:23:40,644 --> 02:23:43,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, DarkSakura, let's wrap up the list.

2023
02:23:43,147 --> 02:23:43,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Number five.

2024
02:23:44,068 --> 02:23:45,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem booth dudes.

2025
02:23:46,890 --> 02:23:48,912
[SPEAKER_02]: As in, like, you know, scantily clad men.

2026
02:23:50,434 --> 02:23:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: What if there is a Duke Nukem?

2027
02:23:52,416 --> 02:23:52,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that count?

2028
02:23:52,936 --> 02:23:53,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't count.

2029
02:23:53,677 --> 02:23:53,997
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2030
02:23:54,578 --> 02:23:56,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, like, you know, like, scantily clad dudes.

2031
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

2032
02:23:58,522 --> 02:23:58,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

2033
02:24:00,293 --> 02:24:07,740
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be kind of a risky one, but... And not including, because I know that these are coming out, because I look at this kind of stuff.

2034
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:17,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Not including these greatest hits, re-releases, or third-party games.

2035
02:24:17,569 --> 02:24:21,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not see any new first-party PSP games.

2036
02:24:22,774 --> 02:24:24,755
[SPEAKER_05]: No new first-party PSP games.

2037
02:24:24,816 --> 02:24:25,136
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a...

2038
02:24:25,942 --> 02:24:27,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm talking about actual UMD discs.

2039
02:24:27,943 --> 02:24:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about some stupid download content.

2040
02:24:30,385 --> 02:24:34,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking first party UMD PSP games.

2041
02:24:36,069 --> 02:24:40,973
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf in our chat is calling shenanigans on the fact that you have a Konami thing on your list and they already did a press conference.

2042
02:24:41,493 --> 02:24:45,096
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'm actually going to back you up because that doesn't mean it was everything.

2043
02:24:45,416 --> 02:24:48,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't know what Nintendo's got.

2044
02:24:48,258 --> 02:24:51,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything that Konami's making for the new Nintendo system is under wraps.

2045
02:24:53,451 --> 02:24:58,653
[SPEAKER_05]: and I would stand by the fact that just because they didn't say it in their little pre thing doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

2046
02:24:59,013 --> 02:25:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Glee Karaoke Revolution wasn't in their thing.

2047
02:25:02,134 --> 02:25:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Guarantee you there's another one of those coming.

2048
02:25:04,674 --> 02:25:08,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to allow it even though it's probably a safe bet.

2049
02:25:09,256 --> 02:25:10,436
[SPEAKER_05]: It will still count for tacos.

2050
02:25:11,277 --> 02:25:19,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and my last answer, this is a duplicate and it's a painful one, but I also put, you will not see Half-Life Anything.

2051
02:25:19,646 --> 02:25:20,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Alan.

2052
02:25:21,288 --> 02:25:22,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually wrote it just like that.

2053
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life Anything.

2054
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:23,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Alan.

2055
02:25:24,548 --> 02:25:26,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought of Alan when I put that on there.

2056
02:25:27,169 --> 02:25:39,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was at work, I would plug in my little iPhone and listen to all the dialogue through Half-Life 2, through all the episodes.

2057
02:25:40,896 --> 02:25:42,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I got through Half-Life.

2058
02:25:43,197 --> 02:25:43,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2059
02:25:43,578 --> 02:25:47,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't really play much at home, so I got to hear the entire game.

2060
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:49,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, I want more!

2061
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:49,881
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens?! !

2062
02:25:50,521 --> 02:25:55,922
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's recap the five buzz things, the things that will cause a host to lose a point if it happens.

2063
02:25:56,102 --> 02:25:56,643
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

2064
02:25:57,903 --> 02:26:09,246
[SPEAKER_02]: My list, dun-dun-dun, is no Final Fantasy VII remake, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 will not be announced, no new Microsoft or Sega systems, Sega will make a good Sonic game, and Duke Nukem booth dudes.

2065
02:26:10,306 --> 02:26:10,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

2066
02:26:10,486 --> 02:26:10,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

2067
02:26:12,277 --> 02:26:14,179
[SPEAKER_04]: The Excite Truck sequel is not happening.

2068
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:18,003
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo system will not be under $250.

2069
02:26:18,864 --> 02:26:24,650
[SPEAKER_04]: No community games on 1 vs. 100 stuff.

2070
02:26:25,011 --> 02:26:29,115
[SPEAKER_04]: No Dance Masters game or non-DDR dancing game from Konami.

2071
02:26:29,956 --> 02:26:33,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And no first-party PSP UMD games.

2072
02:26:36,118 --> 02:26:54,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and on my list of five things you won't see, Sony will not acknowledge the PlayStation outage directly, Killer Instinct, Final Fantasy 14 release date for PlayStation 3, you'll see big pushes on 13.2 instead, you will not see a DJ game from Harmonix, meaning one with a turntable and buttons, and you will not see Half-Life anything.

2073
02:26:54,893 --> 02:26:55,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Alan.

2074
02:26:56,926 --> 02:26:58,266
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we'll see what develops.

2075
02:26:59,246 --> 02:27:02,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, I've got to bring in the actual buzzer when we do the recaps.

2076
02:27:02,147 --> 02:27:04,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

2077
02:27:04,327 --> 02:27:04,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got one.

2078
02:27:05,227 --> 02:27:07,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds of Failure has the Family Feud buzzer.

2079
02:27:08,128 --> 02:27:12,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, there's the sound effects thing that Tyra Claw gave me like a year ago with all the failures.

2080
02:27:12,569 --> 02:27:15,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I use that on Tonic Insanity.

2081
02:27:16,009 --> 02:27:17,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it for Dan Shadow.

2082
02:27:17,149 --> 02:27:19,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time he makes a joke, we play Sad Trombone.

2083
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:22,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, there it is.

2084
02:27:22,130 --> 02:27:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bookmarked right here.

2085
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:24,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound Effects of Failure.

2086
02:27:24,871 --> 02:27:25,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you go.

2087
02:27:29,621 --> 02:27:30,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

2088
02:27:30,181 --> 02:27:32,942
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they say, hey, it's a Sonic game that doesn't suck.

2089
02:27:33,282 --> 02:27:34,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, DarkSakura.

2090
02:27:36,723 --> 02:27:40,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that when you click it, then it does the X. That's funny.

2091
02:27:40,925 --> 02:27:41,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the toilet flush too.

2092
02:27:42,486 --> 02:27:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2093
02:27:43,586 --> 02:27:45,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on.

2094
02:27:45,387 --> 02:27:52,570
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to get the FUs of the week done because if we don't get our angst out, then I don't know what happens, but something bad.

2095
02:28:07,803 --> 02:28:09,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I accidentally kicked Loki.

2096
02:28:09,484 --> 02:28:09,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

2097
02:28:09,964 --> 02:28:11,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to voice him and kicked him instead.

2098
02:28:12,485 --> 02:28:16,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, fuck you to Sally Hansen's Miracle Nail Thickener.

2099
02:28:16,967 --> 02:28:25,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work and it bubbles and it stinks really bad too, so thank you Sally Hansen Company for taking $5 of my money.

2100
02:28:26,171 --> 02:28:26,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuckers.

2101
02:28:28,252 --> 02:28:35,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And also fuck you to feeling like crap in my intestines all day from eating all those delicious cupcakes last night.

2102
02:28:36,434 --> 02:28:37,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, Rob.

2103
02:28:37,214 --> 02:28:39,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd you have to bring those delicious orange cupcakes?

2104
02:28:39,595 --> 02:28:41,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They were orange creamsicle cupcakes.

2105
02:28:41,376 --> 02:28:44,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew you would love them because they tasted like the blood orange Pinkberry.

2106
02:28:44,957 --> 02:28:45,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They were better.

2107
02:28:46,298 --> 02:28:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were a little sweeter.

2108
02:28:47,618 --> 02:28:48,619
[SPEAKER_02]: They tasted like creamsicles.

2109
02:28:49,199 --> 02:28:52,220
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I'm writing a high this week because Pinkberry tweeted me this week.

2110
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:56,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did tell me the blood... They told me personally on Twitter the blood orange will be back.

2111
02:28:58,308 --> 02:28:58,668
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2112
02:29:13,999 --> 02:29:15,259
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I wish they didn't close at 10 on Sundays.

2113
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:18,420
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, my FU of the week goes to lack of Pinkberry.

2114
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:27,122
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to the thing freezing up and dumping the listeners for like 10 minutes and I didn't even realize it because we weren't connected in chat still.

2115
02:29:27,842 --> 02:29:32,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And my FU of the week goes to me for not trying harder to do E3 this year.

2116
02:29:32,123 --> 02:29:34,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in retrospect I probably should have done it.

2117
02:29:35,203 --> 02:29:39,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to this whole coverage and kind of trying something different.

2118
02:29:39,904 --> 02:29:51,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know, it's going to be sad kind of missing all the atmosphere of E3 But at the same time, my wallet says, thank you But, Disneyland I know, there is Disneyland, that's going to rock It's a small world

2119
02:29:52,987 --> 02:29:53,928
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2120
02:30:21,545 --> 02:30:26,368
[SPEAKER_02]: and me who gets bad vertigo and hates roller coasters can do California Screamin' just fine.

2121
02:30:26,728 --> 02:30:28,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, or Tower of Terror.

2122
02:30:28,829 --> 02:30:30,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot, no, I can't do Tower of Terror.

2123
02:30:31,330 --> 02:30:32,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried Tower of Terror.

2124
02:30:32,050 --> 02:30:33,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take Bobby on Tower of Terror.

2125
02:30:33,491 --> 02:30:34,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan will go on Tower of Terror.

2126
02:30:35,652 --> 02:30:36,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Tower of Terror.

2127
02:30:37,013 --> 02:30:39,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's in the other room saying, I'll go on Tower of Terror twice.

2128
02:30:39,274 --> 02:30:41,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, I scream like a girl on Tower of Terror.

2129
02:30:42,976 --> 02:30:48,579
[SPEAKER_02]: No, when I came off of Tower of Terror, I was so dizzy that I could not walk straight, okay?

2130
02:30:49,531 --> 02:30:50,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to FUs of the week.

2131
02:30:50,472 --> 02:30:50,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Loki.

2132
02:30:51,412 --> 02:30:53,353
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Disneyland talk.

2133
02:30:55,233 --> 02:30:58,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess... I don't know.

2134
02:30:58,995 --> 02:31:02,196
[SPEAKER_04]: FU not being able to go to E3, because I really would have liked to have gone to E3.

2135
02:31:03,256 --> 02:31:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily to be able to see all the wonderful booths and stuff, because I'd be in my own hotel room.

2136
02:31:07,418 --> 02:31:09,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to sleep all night long.

2137
02:31:10,639 --> 02:31:12,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how I wish I could sleep all night long.

2138
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:15,001
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have thought about that before you had a baby.

2139
02:31:15,021 --> 02:31:15,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

2140
02:31:16,812 --> 02:31:17,392
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2141
02:31:38,570 --> 02:32:05,778
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's a given that babies wake up at 3 in the morning hungry or poopy or have to pee or that they want mommy all the time not really actually all of our friends don't have a problem with that it's baby nature it's just that our child decides hey you know what I need to be swaddled still at 10 months I wake up at 3 in the morning sometimes screaming whatever you know we moved him into his own room so that's also an additional bit of fun um

2142
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:07,520
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

2143
02:32:34,679 --> 02:32:36,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so this is kind of cool.

2144
02:32:37,302 --> 02:32:48,193
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's been a lot of rumors that there's going to be gaming coming to the Apple TV device, but everyone seems to forget, hey, you know what, there's other things out there that you can stream movies onto.

2145
02:32:48,833 --> 02:32:58,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And now Rovio is actually negotiating with developers to create games specifically for their Roku box.

2146
02:32:58,963 --> 02:33:28,267
[SPEAKER_04]: and it will I guess be TV based games you know casual stuff and they haven't really said how the controller is going to work I guess it may be the new boxes or whatever can come with a controller but it's kind of neat though to see the gaming is coming to everything I mean I'm sure it won't be long before we're just you know having internet enabled TVs that you're playing games off of without any sort of additional software yeah on live

2147
02:33:30,510 --> 02:33:32,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Without any additional software.

2148
02:33:32,713 --> 02:33:33,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the boxes.

2149
02:33:33,874 --> 02:33:34,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I understand that.

2150
02:33:34,715 --> 02:33:36,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about internet-enabled TVs.

2151
02:33:37,058 --> 02:33:37,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright.

2152
02:33:38,139 --> 02:33:38,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

2153
02:33:41,218 --> 02:33:43,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so would you be interested in a Roku box?

2154
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:43,641
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2155
02:33:44,301 --> 02:33:44,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a feeling.

2156
02:33:46,203 --> 02:33:46,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I?

2157
02:33:46,944 --> 02:33:47,604
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason.

2158
02:33:48,906 --> 02:33:49,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2159
02:33:51,128 --> 02:33:51,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

2160
02:33:52,229 --> 02:33:54,852
[SPEAKER_05]: You poor guys are bullying Bobby into writing the ride.

2161
02:33:54,932 --> 02:33:55,312
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

2162
02:33:55,552 --> 02:34:01,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just being honest because keep in mind the first time I read California Screamin' I wrote it in the middle and got sick as fuck.

2163
02:34:02,671 --> 02:34:05,556
[SPEAKER_05]: At least we'll go on Toy Story Midway Mania and that ride is amazing.

2164
02:34:05,596 --> 02:34:05,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

2165
02:34:06,136 --> 02:34:11,064
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I started riding California Screamin' in the front car, never got sick again.

2166
02:34:12,126 --> 02:34:14,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the same like being in the front seat of the car.

2167
02:34:15,290 --> 02:34:17,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I get motion sick in the back seat but in the front seat I'm fine.

2168
02:34:18,755 --> 02:34:21,016
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

2169
02:34:21,036 --> 02:34:24,617
[SPEAKER_05]: This story is about Animal Crossing, but it might not be what you're expecting.

2170
02:34:25,318 --> 02:34:31,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a story that Kotaku ran earlier this week, and I guess it was kind of from another site called AntiPixelante.com.

2171
02:34:32,741 --> 02:34:33,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the deal.

2172
02:34:33,721 --> 02:34:35,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a story about...

2173
02:34:37,492 --> 02:34:39,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know where to go here with Animal Crossing.

2174
02:34:58,795 --> 02:35:07,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So these people at AntiPixelante actually combed the website to find what Animal Crossing characters were most popular on Rule 34.

2175
02:35:08,459 --> 02:35:18,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe it or not, there were 59 pornographic images of the Stitch Lady that helps you do the cross, make your own patterns.

2176
02:35:18,223 --> 02:35:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It was named Hazel?

2177
02:35:19,464 --> 02:35:20,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Hazel.

2178
02:35:20,544 --> 02:35:24,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So Hazel was the most popular character with 59 pornographic images.

2179
02:35:25,308 --> 02:35:29,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, and I'm surprised he wasn't number one, Tom Nook was second place with 30.

2180
02:35:31,013 --> 02:35:34,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other, well, it's Abel and Mabel or something like that, isn't it?

2181
02:35:34,976 --> 02:35:35,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The Abel sisters.

2182
02:35:35,857 --> 02:35:36,658
[SPEAKER_05]: The Abel sisters.

2183
02:35:36,698 --> 02:35:37,939
[SPEAKER_05]: The other Abel sister had 15.

2184
02:35:38,019 --> 02:35:38,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Mabel and Sable.

2185
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:42,043
[SPEAKER_05]: and then KK whatever he is.

2186
02:35:42,063 --> 02:35:42,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So did KK.

2187
02:35:43,144 --> 02:35:43,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Was 13.

2188
02:35:44,906 --> 02:35:47,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't even know who that last chick is at 9.

2189
02:35:47,309 --> 02:35:49,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hair style.

2190
02:35:49,371 --> 02:35:50,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's the hair lady.

2191
02:35:50,252 --> 02:35:50,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2192
02:35:50,853 --> 02:35:53,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you want to know what animals showed up the most.

2193
02:35:53,977 --> 02:35:55,118
[SPEAKER_02]: That raccoon cock.

2194
02:35:58,441 --> 02:36:01,844
[SPEAKER_05]: This actually gives me a whole new incentive to play Animal Crossing again.

2195
02:36:02,124 --> 02:36:04,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make the most offensive village possible.

2196
02:36:05,467 --> 02:36:06,768
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost did that with mine.

2197
02:36:07,168 --> 02:36:07,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

2198
02:36:08,589 --> 02:36:09,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the town lesbian.

2199
02:36:11,051 --> 02:36:13,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had people running around saying cocksucker.

2200
02:36:14,834 --> 02:36:19,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they show this posting of a board where somebody has written, you know how you can write your own messages on the board in town?

2201
02:36:19,977 --> 02:36:20,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Nook special.

2202
02:36:21,078 --> 02:36:22,880
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a very special item in today.

2203
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:25,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's Nook's fat raccoon cock.

2204
02:36:25,482 --> 02:36:27,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Come check it out at Nookington's.

2205
02:36:30,003 --> 02:36:33,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, what villagers were most shown in compromising positions?

2206
02:36:33,985 --> 02:36:37,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not, 15 different cats compromising 138.

2207
02:36:37,968 --> 02:36:42,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Tabby was number one at 36 porno images.

2208
02:36:43,691 --> 02:36:45,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I really reporting on this of Tabby?

2209
02:36:45,612 --> 02:36:46,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you are.

2210
02:36:47,854 --> 02:36:56,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Six different wolves, 111 humans, four different elephants, ten bunnies, nine squirrels, and seven dogs.

2211
02:36:56,681 --> 02:36:58,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Dogs only shown 20 times.

2212
02:36:58,823 --> 02:37:02,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The mummy dog was in seven different pornographic images.

2213
02:37:03,106 --> 02:37:05,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people like the bandaged up people.

2214
02:37:10,712 --> 02:37:12,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what to say about that anymore.

2215
02:37:13,194 --> 02:37:13,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking.

2216
02:37:13,815 --> 02:37:14,836
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless the internet.

2217
02:37:14,856 --> 02:37:16,057
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only thing I can think of.

2218
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:20,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to find where the pictures are.

2219
02:37:20,864 --> 02:37:22,005
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual pictures are not there.

2220
02:37:22,045 --> 02:37:25,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to that Rule 34 and I'm a little afraid to go to that site.

2221
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:26,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

2222
02:37:26,351 --> 02:37:26,851
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2223
02:37:26,911 --> 02:37:27,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

2224
02:37:27,292 --> 02:37:28,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I will fucking go to Rule 34.

2225
02:37:31,377 --> 02:37:33,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Only because I'm on Jamie's computer.

2226
02:37:34,341 --> 02:37:36,802
[SPEAKER_11]: My computer, that's the Orange Lounge computer.

2227
02:37:36,822 --> 02:37:38,602
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one that our listeners built us.

2228
02:37:38,782 --> 02:37:40,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then I'm going on the listener computer.

2229
02:37:41,243 --> 02:37:43,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what is this website here?

2230
02:37:44,743 --> 02:37:45,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Rule 34, there we go.

2231
02:37:45,483 --> 02:37:47,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to copy.

2232
02:37:47,804 --> 02:37:50,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just really afraid of what I'm about to see when I go to this website.

2233
02:37:50,384 --> 02:37:52,005
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be worse than Two Girls, One Cup.

2234
02:37:54,045 --> 02:37:55,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm waiting for it to load.

2235
02:37:56,666 --> 02:37:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an Animal Crossing movie?

2236
02:37:59,046 --> 02:38:00,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, okay, I'm going to search.

2237
02:38:00,607 --> 02:38:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I have that already.

2238
02:38:03,527 --> 02:38:04,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have it subtitled?

2239
02:38:05,292 --> 02:38:06,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've got it subtitled somewhere

2240
02:38:08,298 --> 02:38:12,342
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerCon chatroom says, Sky, you do realize what you're getting yourself into, furry porn.

2241
02:38:13,623 --> 02:38:22,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, it's my job to be an objective reporter, and if there's news out there... I'm the one that posted that link.

2242
02:38:22,371 --> 02:38:23,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We always gotta have something pornographic.

2243
02:38:23,772 --> 02:38:24,913
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you want to say about it?

2244
02:38:25,333 --> 02:38:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to say about it?

2245
02:38:27,515 --> 02:38:28,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Typical internet.

2246
02:38:28,436 --> 02:38:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

2247
02:38:29,617 --> 02:38:33,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, if it's gonna be a character, they're gonna have sex with somebody.

2248
02:38:34,318 --> 02:38:36,999
[SPEAKER_05]: This stupid website's timing out, I think, because we're trying to do a show.

2249
02:38:37,019 --> 02:38:39,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm searching for Animal Crossing and nothing's happening.

2250
02:38:39,380 --> 02:38:40,400
[SPEAKER_02]: There's images, though.

2251
02:38:41,841 --> 02:38:47,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone on Yahoo Answers said... What was it?

2252
02:38:48,603 --> 02:38:50,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually asked to see if it had been done yet.

2253
02:38:53,625 --> 02:38:55,005
[SPEAKER_05]: This website kind of sucks.

2254
02:38:55,025 --> 02:38:58,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on the... There's a Rule 34 with two ad-ads doing it.

2255
02:39:02,242 --> 02:39:07,225
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.

2256
02:39:10,327 --> 02:39:11,047
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, forget it.

2257
02:39:11,067 --> 02:39:12,588
[SPEAKER_05]: This segment's going nowhere.

2258
02:39:12,608 --> 02:39:15,790
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2259
02:39:16,170 --> 02:39:18,692
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give us a call, we will chat about whatever.

2260
02:39:18,752 --> 02:39:20,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Please not Rule 34, for the love of God.

2261
02:39:20,973 --> 02:39:24,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2262
02:39:24,495 --> 02:39:26,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, how about last-minute stories?

2263
02:39:27,337 --> 02:39:27,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, look.

2264
02:39:28,437 --> 02:39:56,973
[SPEAKER_04]: uh yeah uh apparently there's you know of course the Kinect Star Wars game is being shown um by the way the Kinect Star Wars game based on the video footage that we've seen so far looks very terrible uh lag-tastic fun uh also apparently there is going to be a uh Disneyland Adventures game for Kinect where you run around Disneyland and ride rides and stuff like that sounds like a game that you two would be picking up yeah

2265
02:40:01,482 --> 02:40:02,183
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of awesome.

2266
02:40:02,203 --> 02:40:02,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's awful.

2267
02:40:03,123 --> 02:40:06,225
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a modder for Super Smash Bros.

2268
02:40:06,305 --> 02:40:12,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl that made a mod for that replacing Solid Snake with Conan O'Brien.

2269
02:40:13,808 --> 02:40:17,590
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, he even does his string dance at the end of the round.

2270
02:40:18,310 --> 02:40:19,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

2271
02:40:20,051 --> 02:40:23,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's a place you can download that.

2272
02:40:26,648 --> 02:40:50,164
[SPEAKER_04]: forms.kc-mim.com slash gallery slash brawl or slash brawlview.php question mark number 1000 I'm sure people are writing this down furiously well you know what they download the podcast and they can go back and rewind it and stuff like that and get everything number equals 19,277 alright or just go search on Kotaku you can find it interesting

2273
02:40:56,076 --> 02:41:19,820
[SPEAKER_04]: also the Metal Gear and Zone of Enders those collections will actually be downloadable as well so if you don't want to purchase the box sets and maybe you only want one title in HD you can download those I believe separately so that's going to be kind of neat I found you subtitled Animal Crossing on YouTube and linked it to you awesome I will share it with everybody

2274
02:41:22,105 --> 02:41:24,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, is that just the trailer or is that the whole movie?

2275
02:41:24,986 --> 02:41:25,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it's the whole movie.

2276
02:41:26,566 --> 02:41:28,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

2277
02:41:29,067 --> 02:41:29,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2278
02:41:29,927 --> 02:41:32,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I was going to talk about here.

2279
02:41:33,908 --> 02:41:41,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Mad Catz, you know, following the footsteps of Red Octane, are actually becoming game publishers themselves.

2280
02:41:41,891 --> 02:41:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: They have launched Thunderhawk Studios and they are developing a flight sim game.

2281
02:41:49,833 --> 02:41:50,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

2282
02:41:52,557 --> 02:41:57,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I did a search on the whole Animal Crossing and Tom Nook and nothing came up.

2283
02:41:57,981 --> 02:42:01,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I found one image of Tom Nook and Tom Nook.

2284
02:42:02,304 --> 02:42:03,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you go to 4chan?

2285
02:42:04,906 --> 02:42:07,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely not going there on DarkSakura's show computers.

2286
02:42:07,989 --> 02:42:08,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what we'll affect it with.

2287
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:09,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a call.

2288
02:42:10,491 --> 02:42:11,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a call.

2289
02:42:11,471 --> 02:42:12,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun digging through that.

2290
02:42:12,732 --> 02:42:13,113
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a call.

2291
02:42:13,153 --> 02:42:13,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2292
02:42:14,013 --> 02:42:14,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2293
02:42:15,254 --> 02:42:17,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to stop all the Animal Crossing talk.

2294
02:42:17,296 --> 02:42:17,656
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

2295
02:42:18,957 --> 02:42:19,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Bobby.

2296
02:42:19,557 --> 02:42:19,958
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

2297
02:42:21,036 --> 02:42:21,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing good.

2298
02:42:21,997 --> 02:42:23,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you excited for E3?

2299
02:42:23,939 --> 02:42:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'm excited more for E3 or not going on California Screamin'.

2300
02:42:29,264 --> 02:42:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm trying to get them to stop picking on you, but you should be glad my friend Victoria isn't going because she says, I have a rule.

2301
02:42:37,211 --> 02:42:41,235
[SPEAKER_05]: You go on every ride once, and if you don't like it, you never have to go on it again.

2302
02:42:41,795 --> 02:42:43,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm a little more forgiving.

2303
02:42:43,197 --> 02:42:45,599
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody says, no, Rob, I'm really not going on it, I'm like, okay, whatever.

2304
02:42:45,619 --> 02:42:46,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I did that.

2305
02:42:46,239 --> 02:42:46,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to bully.

2306
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:51,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on Tower of Terror and it sucked.

2307
02:42:51,563 --> 02:42:52,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want Bobby to barf.

2308
02:42:52,684 --> 02:42:54,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So if he's going to barf, he's not going on it.

2309
02:42:55,045 --> 02:42:55,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't barf.

2310
02:42:55,746 --> 02:43:00,129
[SPEAKER_06]: What it is is I do have a medical condition and I will pass out.

2311
02:43:01,207 --> 02:43:05,048
[SPEAKER_06]: and I don't want to pass out and Disney doesn't want me to pass out because then they escort you out of the park.

2312
02:43:05,108 --> 02:43:10,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you will have to hydrate him and watch over him if he passes out because you forced him to go on that ride.

2313
02:43:11,031 --> 02:43:13,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Dan's like, then we get to go backstage.

2314
02:43:14,432 --> 02:43:22,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look, we're playing the little game tonight about things you will see and things you won't see at E3 and you're calling shenanigans on Loki's list, I know.

2315
02:43:23,715 --> 02:43:23,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2316
02:43:24,016 --> 02:43:25,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Bobby, I'm going to put you on the spot.

2317
02:43:25,537 --> 02:43:29,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't make you name five, but tell me something you think we will see, maybe that we missed.

2318
02:43:29,639 --> 02:43:31,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Something we will see and something we won't see.

2319
02:43:32,751 --> 02:43:39,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, the won't see is... Actually, I had a call on my show tonight that asked me, you know, what would you not see there?

2320
02:43:39,814 --> 02:43:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said a new Space Quest.

2321
02:43:41,695 --> 02:43:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Or really, any new Sierra adventure titles.

2322
02:43:45,437 --> 02:43:46,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a pretty fair guess, yeah.

2323
02:43:47,598 --> 02:43:52,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, I can't see Activision resurrecting King's Quest or anything like that.

2324
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:54,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, haven't we had the Telltale King's Quest games were announced?

2325
02:43:57,042 --> 02:43:58,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't that come out a few months ago?

2326
02:43:59,063 --> 02:43:59,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but we won't see it at E3.

2327
02:43:59,943 --> 02:44:00,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

2328
02:44:03,514 --> 02:44:04,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get my buzzer ready.

2329
02:44:06,175 --> 02:44:06,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not playing.

2330
02:44:07,176 --> 02:44:09,297
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right, fine, fine.

2331
02:44:10,418 --> 02:44:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, we'll see.

2332
02:44:11,218 --> 02:44:12,999
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what about something that will happen?

2333
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:15,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that will.

2334
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:23,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, you know, it's kind of hard because, like, I've seen a lot of the stuff that, you know, kind of is going in and stuff.

2335
02:44:25,365 --> 02:44:28,747
[SPEAKER_06]: What we will see, I think we will...

2336
02:44:30,333 --> 02:44:30,974
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2337
02:44:53,511 --> 02:44:57,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what I want to see is I want to see them do Pac-Man vs. as one of the demo games.

2338
02:44:58,373 --> 02:44:58,913
[SPEAKER_05]: They could.

2339
02:44:58,953 --> 02:45:03,235
[SPEAKER_05]: They could re-release all that stuff that they did for the Game Boy Advance Kinect cable that nobody ever played.

2340
02:45:03,255 --> 02:45:03,875
[SPEAKER_05]: They can?

2341
02:45:04,296 --> 02:45:06,276
[SPEAKER_05]: They will because that's Nintendo.

2342
02:45:06,577 --> 02:45:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well that's easy.

2343
02:45:07,517 --> 02:45:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it that way.

2344
02:45:09,058 --> 02:45:12,339
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one that probably wouldn't happen is Crystal Chronicles because that wasn't first party.

2345
02:45:12,379 --> 02:45:13,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a weird game.

2346
02:45:13,299 --> 02:45:14,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it, but it was weird.

2347
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:16,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't really Final Fantasy.

2348
02:45:16,161 --> 02:45:19,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of in that storyline, I guess.

2349
02:45:20,703 --> 02:45:25,606
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, any other thoughts for us, Bobby, before we talk to you again on Tuesday live from Los Angeles?

2350
02:45:26,266 --> 02:45:32,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'm supposed to look for large chibis, and I'm supposed to look for Duke Nukem booth dudes.

2351
02:45:32,729 --> 02:45:32,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2352
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:35,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2353
02:45:35,111 --> 02:45:37,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I provide the buzzer if I find the booth dudes?

2354
02:45:37,732 --> 02:45:38,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can.

2355
02:45:38,672 --> 02:45:44,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have found, they usually do have somewhere the scantily clad muscular guys.

2356
02:45:44,996 --> 02:45:45,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2357
02:45:46,357 --> 02:45:49,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the question is, are they going to be advertising Duke Nukem?

2358
02:45:49,693 --> 02:45:50,294
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out.

2359
02:45:50,514 --> 02:45:51,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So get that buzzer ready.

2360
02:45:51,435 --> 02:45:54,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I give you full permission to buzz DarkSakura if that happens.

2361
02:45:55,358 --> 02:45:57,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're going to buzz me, I'm sure.

2362
02:45:57,139 --> 02:45:57,520
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, yes.

2363
02:45:59,261 --> 02:46:00,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you go by Telltale's booth?

2364
02:46:02,708 --> 02:46:04,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they have a booth.

2365
02:46:05,330 --> 02:46:06,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they do at E3 either.

2366
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:08,551
[SPEAKER_05]: They do at PAX.

2367
02:46:09,292 --> 02:46:12,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do PAX, but they don't get a booth at E3.

2368
02:46:13,254 --> 02:46:17,516
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is a King Quest thing, they'd be probably shown at an Activision's booth because they own the IP.

2369
02:46:18,037 --> 02:46:18,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

2370
02:46:18,777 --> 02:46:19,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a joint thingy.

2371
02:46:21,138 --> 02:46:21,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2372
02:46:21,759 --> 02:46:23,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Bobby, we'll talk to you more on Tuesday.

2373
02:46:23,399 --> 02:46:24,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a safe flight tomorrow.

2374
02:46:25,387 --> 02:46:27,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and no more Rule 34 talk.

2375
02:46:27,288 --> 02:46:27,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, guys.

2376
02:46:27,908 --> 02:46:28,689
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll try.

2377
02:46:28,769 --> 02:46:29,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Be professional.

2378
02:46:29,669 --> 02:46:29,969
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try.

2379
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:33,291
[SPEAKER_05]: How long have you been listening to this show?

2380
02:46:34,112 --> 02:46:34,952
[SPEAKER_06]: About seven years.

2381
02:46:35,332 --> 02:46:35,633
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2382
02:46:37,173 --> 02:46:37,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Bobby.

2383
02:46:38,254 --> 02:46:40,235
[SPEAKER_06]: See ya.

2384
02:46:40,255 --> 02:46:40,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2385
02:46:40,635 --> 02:46:41,456
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2386
02:46:41,516 --> 02:46:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to call and talk.

2387
02:46:45,378 --> 02:46:45,998
[SPEAKER_05]: More porn talk.

2388
02:46:46,038 --> 02:46:46,398
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

2389
02:46:46,418 --> 02:46:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: What about more last-minute stories?

2390
02:46:47,955 --> 02:46:54,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to do an Animal Crossing that actually has a huge world like in the anime because I started watching anime and it's actually pretty good.

2391
02:46:56,821 --> 02:46:57,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft.

2392
02:46:58,422 --> 02:46:58,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2393
02:46:58,842 --> 02:47:02,045
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is the type of thing I'd usually expect from Ubisoft.

2394
02:47:02,345 --> 02:47:05,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's one of Activision's big announcements that they're going to be making.

2395
02:47:06,228 --> 02:47:10,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision Publishing and Sega Toys, they have created Wappy Dog.

2396
02:47:11,691 --> 02:47:16,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Wappy Dog is basically an AIBO ripoff for the Nintendo DS.

2397
02:47:17,035 --> 02:47:22,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will allow you to interact with the robot dog in the game.

2398
02:47:22,979 --> 02:47:24,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And you will be able to...

2399
02:47:25,281 --> 02:47:27,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Wappy Dog come with Jacka Cat?

2400
02:47:30,288 --> 02:47:31,590
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think so.

2401
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:32,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it sounds like to me.

2402
02:47:33,593 --> 02:47:34,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Wappy Dog.

2403
02:47:34,434 --> 02:47:35,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Wappy Dog.

2404
02:47:35,896 --> 02:47:37,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Wappy Dog and Jacka Cat.

2405
02:47:42,218 --> 02:47:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Other Ocean Interactive, they have announced that they're going to be working on a new project for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network based on the H.G.

2406
02:47:49,201 --> 02:48:07,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Wells novel War of the Worlds and of course it's going to be following the events of the 1953 film and include a new story arc, characters, locations and subplots I'd actually be kind of cool to see something like this like Resistance style or something like that

2407
02:48:08,868 --> 02:48:10,288
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as Tom Cruise isn't involved.

2408
02:48:10,328 --> 02:48:12,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the phones for another call.

2409
02:48:12,649 --> 02:48:13,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2410
02:48:13,589 --> 02:48:13,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2411
02:48:15,090 --> 02:48:15,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Zaku here.

2412
02:48:16,110 --> 02:48:17,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zaku.

2413
02:48:17,310 --> 02:48:18,171
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, my friend?

2414
02:48:19,531 --> 02:48:20,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much.

2415
02:48:20,431 --> 02:48:25,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting ready for tomorrow's Case of the Mondays.

2416
02:48:25,633 --> 02:48:27,553
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to sit back and watch the press conferences?

2417
02:48:27,593 --> 02:48:28,713
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to have your popcorn?

2418
02:48:30,094 --> 02:48:34,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to be trying to browse it from my desk.

2419
02:48:34,435 --> 02:48:34,835
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

2420
02:48:34,855 --> 02:48:37,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have two monitors, so I could probably pull it off on one of them.

2421
02:48:38,948 --> 02:48:50,877
[SPEAKER_00]: But going on what I was trying to bring up tonight was the whole Call of Duty Elite thing, which is basically Activision's next shameless attempt at money-grabbing.

2422
02:48:51,498 --> 02:48:53,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, I'm sensing you're not a fan.

2423
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:56,762
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I don't understand when other, like...

2424
02:48:58,598 --> 02:49:09,943
[SPEAKER_00]: When other developers, other companies, you know, like Bungie and EA have offered these services for free, and Activision's mostly paywalling the good stuff, like videos.

2425
02:49:10,843 --> 02:49:17,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what I'm sensing is that they are probably going to herald the next video game crash.

2426
02:49:18,407 --> 02:49:26,010
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about it, and I bring this up because you think about how the first one happened and how this one might draw parallels to the one in 83.

2427
02:49:28,206 --> 02:49:36,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you have one particular company just trying to rehash franchises to the point where quality degrades and fans get turned off.

2428
02:49:44,442 --> 02:49:47,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think another video game crash across the board is possible.

2429
02:49:47,744 --> 02:49:49,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is possible company failures.

2430
02:49:50,145 --> 02:49:52,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think forever you're going to have Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft.

2431
02:49:52,806 --> 02:49:53,726
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them will fail.

2432
02:49:54,486 --> 02:50:01,269
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting to the point where Activision's literally watering down, diluting the entire first-person shooter genre.

2433
02:50:01,909 --> 02:50:03,109
[SPEAKER_00]: If people, for the most...

2434
02:50:05,502 --> 02:50:23,611
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part consumers I'm not talking about the hardcore gamers the ones that consistently buy Call of Duty you know the ones that basically don't have other first-person shooters lined up aside from aside from like the side from Call of Duty Halo gears you know like the small really

2435
02:50:25,261 --> 02:50:37,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to put my finger on the demographic, but it's the type of person that wouldn't care less about what the scene thinks and more important, you know, just like instantly gratified by just explosions.

2436
02:50:37,951 --> 02:50:39,773
[SPEAKER_05]: What about just like voting with your dollars?

2437
02:50:39,793 --> 02:50:41,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a concept we were talking about a lot.

2438
02:50:42,435 --> 02:50:44,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that it's possible, but when you have

2439
02:50:45,936 --> 02:51:07,112
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have one company just giving negative connotations to one genre by just like trying to nickel and dime people every step of the way and just trying to like not really innovate then it's going to be harder for other titles to really stand out unless Battlefield 3 manages to pull an upset which I know it will because it has a lot to offer on the table.

2440
02:51:07,532 --> 02:51:10,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, yeah, I don't think that's going to lead to a crash.

2441
02:51:10,454 --> 02:51:20,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would just be, yeah, Battlefield 3 might become the new champion, you know, or maybe... But then you might get to the point where video gamers are going to get sick and tired of actually having to deal with just mediocrity.

2442
02:51:20,579 --> 02:51:26,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, let me throw this question at you, kind of out of left field here, because you mentioned Halo as one of the games that you think has done it very well.

2443
02:51:26,942 --> 02:51:29,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But we know that Activision and Bungie are partnering up.

2444
02:51:29,283 --> 02:51:34,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Bungie was the first really to pioneer such a thing.

2445
02:51:35,273 --> 02:51:40,704
[SPEAKER_00]: where they integrated the ability to look up your stats online and post the video straight from the console.

2446
02:51:41,670 --> 02:51:46,313
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bungie and Activision are partnering up for whatever this next game is.

2447
02:51:46,353 --> 02:51:47,754
[SPEAKER_05]: At least Activision is publishing it.

2448
02:51:47,834 --> 02:51:54,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think that the same nickel and dime extra stuff I don't really need thing is going to continue?

2449
02:51:55,299 --> 02:51:56,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It's under Activision.

2450
02:51:56,459 --> 02:51:58,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Microsoft didn't do that much.

2451
02:51:58,601 --> 02:51:59,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't even do any of that.

2452
02:52:00,602 --> 02:52:04,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when Bungie was working with Microsoft, that never happened.

2453
02:52:05,005 --> 02:52:10,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were trying new ways to engage people into that genre, into that game.

2454
02:52:11,243 --> 02:52:20,975
[SPEAKER_00]: and what better way than to launch the whole Halo Waypoint thing, I believe, where it allows you to interact, look up your scores, post it on Facebook.

2455
02:52:22,099 --> 02:52:22,739
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.

2456
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:41,612
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when Activision is thrown into the mix, you have a company that's helping on just trying to monetize and maximize every single dollar out of all their IP to the point where they're willing to cut corners and sacrifice quality in the name of the almighty dollar.

2457
02:52:42,112 --> 02:52:43,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let me ask this question.

2458
02:52:43,052 --> 02:52:44,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to wrap up and get more calls.

2459
02:52:44,473 --> 02:52:45,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask this question and end on this.

2460
02:52:46,154 --> 02:52:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think they could do to make more money on the franchise that doesn't seem so nickel and dime?

2461
02:52:53,206 --> 02:53:01,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, you shouldn't try to nickel and dime for things that have been offered for free in the past.

2462
02:53:02,229 --> 02:53:07,251
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole Call of Duty Elite, many people have shrugged it off so far.

2463
02:53:08,103 --> 02:53:18,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Because from what I heard, for example, on the other sites, like Otaku, for example, they basically wrote it off as just another money grab.

2464
02:53:18,666 --> 02:53:23,768
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really have no hopes for this endeavor.

2465
02:53:24,248 --> 02:53:24,908
[SPEAKER_00]: They really don't.

2466
02:53:25,168 --> 02:53:31,370
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't phase them, it doesn't engage them that well, and that's getting a really lukewarm reception.

2467
02:53:33,272 --> 02:53:38,696
[SPEAKER_00]: and more importantly, trying to create innovative ways to re-engage your customers.

2468
02:53:38,796 --> 02:53:48,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to rehash the same boring old five-hour campaign and instead offering new ways to offer balanced gameplay.

2469
02:53:49,384 --> 02:53:56,387
[SPEAKER_00]: If they fix up the gameplay in multiplayer where it's not a camp fest, then they have a better shot.

2470
02:53:56,827 --> 02:53:59,107
[SPEAKER_05]: We at least have one person agreeing with you in the chat room.

2471
02:53:59,127 --> 02:54:04,289
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkToagak says, Activision is one shit of a company for lack of something less constructive to say.

2472
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:09,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can try to get at least one more call tonight, but have a good one.

2473
02:54:09,915 --> 02:54:10,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, have a good one

2474
02:54:24,929 --> 02:54:26,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to get out here, Loki, with last-minute stories?

2475
02:54:26,950 --> 02:54:30,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Microsoft has officially announced what games they're going to be showing at E3.

2476
02:54:30,213 --> 02:54:33,735
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be in their booth, including third-party stuff.

2477
02:54:34,375 --> 02:54:35,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it sounds interesting.

2478
02:54:36,237 --> 02:54:38,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, starting off, some of these you've probably heard before.

2479

[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider, Forza 4, Star Wars Connect, Gears of War 3, a Halo-related title.

2480
02:54:44,642 --> 02:54:45,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's Halo Connect.

2481
02:54:46,764 --> 02:54:50,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Codename Kingdoms, Sesame Street, Once Upon a Monster.

2482
02:54:51,046 --> 02:54:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the new... What the fuck was it?

2483
02:54:56,510 --> 02:55:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Double Fine game Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Steel Battalion Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is not supposed to be playable I wonder if maybe it's just a trailer That would be hot if they're showing that playable on the floor

2484
02:55:17,192 --> 02:55:29,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Steel Battalion Heavy Armor, Alan Wake Night Springs, XCOM, Hitman Absolution, Modern Warfare 3, Spelunky HD, Ghost Recon,

2485
02:55:31,410 --> 02:55:54,126

2486
02:55:56,028 --> 02:55:56,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2487
02:55:57,662 --> 02:56:00,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's some of your announcements for E3.

2488
02:56:00,984 --> 02:56:02,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2506

02:57:40,373 --> 02:57:41,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's new console.

2508
02:57:41,353 --> 02:57:46,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of curious to see what they've got going on with that.

2509
02:57:46,896 --> 02:57:48,096
[SPEAKER_05]: If that were to actually happen, I'd die.

2510
02:57:48,116 --> 02:57:52,798
[SPEAKER_09]: The show would be done because I would have died.

2511
02:58:05,163 --> 02:58:23,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he just got chased out no he's talking with Dan they're having boy talk about something oh boys alright let's see so what would make you insanely happy if Nintendo announced on their new console like I've talked about I want an F-Zero game what game do you want?

[SPEAKER_05]: I want an Animal Crossing porn game on the new cafe.

[SPEAKER_04]: An Animal Crossing game with the Nintendo games intact would be awesome.

2523
02:58:48,513 --> 02:58:54,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about a new... I'm talking about a new Animal Crossing game, not this like, hey, look, we ported the same damn game over...

2524
02:58:56,033 --> 02:58:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2525
02:58:56,653 --> 02:59:00,276
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DT, I'm going to let you go so you can go slap Black Wolf with the trout in the chat room.

2526
02:59:00,296 --> 02:59:02,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks for calling, and I hope La Mulana comes out soon.

2527
02:59:02,717 --> 02:59:03,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no problem.

2528
02:59:03,537 --> 02:59:03,818
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2529
02:59:04,658 --> 02:59:04,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2530
02:59:05,459 --> 02:59:13,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm a little worried because if La Mulana comes out too soon, then Dark Tetsuya will never finish his series on Where Are They Now that he's doing for the website.

2531
02:59:13,363 --> 02:59:14,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know who he's interviewing.

2532
02:59:14,924 --> 02:59:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a secret.

2533
02:59:16,285 --> 02:59:21,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's found blasts from OLR's past to interview on our website throughout the next month.

2534
02:59:21,628 --> 02:59:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be interesting.

2535
02:59:23,729 --> 02:59:24,069
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2536
02:59:24,109 --> 02:59:25,470
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2537
02:59:25,490 --> 02:59:28,971
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you, I don't know, want to leave us a voicemail or whatever.

2538
02:59:28,991 --> 02:59:32,753
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails every week.

2539
02:59:32,873 --> 02:59:35,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other last-minute stories I missed, Loki, that you wanted to get to?

2540
02:59:35,234 --> 02:59:36,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even DarkSakura?

2541
02:59:36,815 --> 02:59:39,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Carmageddon coming out as a download title.

2542
02:59:39,896 --> 02:59:40,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2543
02:59:41,977 --> 02:59:43,878
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I wanted to talk about for now.

2544
02:59:44,878 --> 02:59:46,239
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have something a little later, though.

2545
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:49,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe something to stay tuned after the show for.

2546
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:49,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, maybe.

2547
02:59:51,263 --> 02:59:54,184
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, anyhow, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

2548
02:59:54,204 --> 02:59:56,264
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts in just a moment.

02:59:56,284 --> 03:00:01,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, I just want to say, again, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and supporting our show.

03:00:01,565 --> 03:00:04,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I'm a little bit sad panda, I'm not going to E3 this year.

2551
03:00:04,565 --> 03:00:11,207
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason I have been able to go to E3 in the years past is because of this show and you guys really kind of fueling that fire.

2552
03:00:11,267 --> 03:00:12,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you guys so much.

2553
03:00:12,467 --> 03:00:17,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to the coverage this week and just having fun with the news and giving it its proper skewering.

[SPEAKER_05]: Leave us a nice five-star review.

2559
03:00:31,176 --> 03:00:39,822
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, there was an awesome five-star review left this week about somebody saying that he listened to the show when he was younger and he feels like he's kind of grown up with the show and I'm like, aw, warm buzzies.

2560
03:00:40,342 --> 03:01:04,968
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah leave us a nice review on iTunes you don't have to be warm fuzzy so if you don't want to or tell a friend that's what we really want just tell word of mouth is all we got we do not have a giant booth at E3 just spread the word of OLR we will be lucky if we're able to get within 50 feet of the building and you know we don't have any of the advertising dollars or whatever word of mouth is all we got so tell a friend about the show all right let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts DarkSakura your final thoughts I have to help someone move tomorrow

2561
03:01:07,136 --> 03:01:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I'm going to be making the popcorn and making Alan get up early to watch Microsoft's conference tomorrow.

2562
03:01:11,379 --> 03:01:12,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

03:01:15,361 --> 03:01:18,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Just looking forward to tomorrow and watching the conferences.

2565
03:01:18,323 --> 03:01:21,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really disappointed that Nintendo isn't tomorrow, but whatever.

2566
03:01:22,306 --> 03:01:23,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Good things come to those who wait.

2567
03:01:25,688 --> 03:01:29,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I think our Winamp might have crashed again here.

2568
03:01:29,910 --> 03:01:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just lovely.

2569
03:01:30,771 --> 03:01:32,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Is people in chats complaining about the stream?

2570
03:01:33,653 --> 03:01:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my Winamp has locked up yet again.

2571
03:01:37,773 --> 03:01:38,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not having good luck today.

2572
03:01:40,257 --> 03:01:41,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, my app's locked.

2573
03:01:41,218 --> 03:01:41,839
[SPEAKER_05]: We're down again.

2574
03:01:44,062 --> 03:01:44,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio.

2575
03:01:44,843 --> 03:01:45,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't have it any other way.

2576
03:01:49,369 --> 03:01:50,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's try to reconnect.

2577
03:01:51,993 --> 03:01:53,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'm about to get kicked.

2578
03:01:54,739 --> 03:01:57,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, there's some type of hiccup in the line or something.

2579
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I think your internet might just be down.

2580
03:01:59,961 --> 03:02:00,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even connect.

2581
03:02:04,163 --> 03:02:04,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still connected.

2582
03:02:05,984 --> 03:02:08,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to a random website here.

2583
03:02:08,425 --> 03:02:09,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot get through on the server.

2584
03:02:11,226 --> 03:02:12,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, mine's working just fine.

2585
03:02:12,547 --> 03:02:21,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we're going to, actually what we're going to do, we're going to just, for the sake of the podcast, we'll play the credits, since we're pretty much done with the show anyway, and then we'll figure out what to do about our live listeners when we come back.

2586
03:02:22,411 --> 03:02:23,991
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's going to do it.

2587
03:02:24,352 --> 03:02:32,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for listening to us on the podcast feed, and sorry it was a little bit of a mess tonight, but you can't really plan for things like random internet outages.

2588
03:02:32,415 --> 03:02:33,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, everybody.

2589
