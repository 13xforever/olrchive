00:14.241 --> 00:24.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, June 19, 2011, more details emerge on the Wii U, a Facebook game developer sues an alleged copycat, and a Kinect software development kit for Windows is released.

00:31.533 --> 00:38.675
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.015 --> 00:39.855
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:39.875 --> 00:44.837
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:45.057 --> 00:45.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

00:45.637 --> 00:46.137
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

00:46.697 --> 00:47.297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm unwell.

00:47.658 --> 00:48.678
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:48.938 --> 00:49.498
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong?

00:49.938 --> 00:50.618
[SPEAKER_09]: Sinuses.

00:51.359 --> 00:51.519
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

00:51.779 --> 00:52.379
[SPEAKER_09]: You're Manuel?

00:53.303 --> 00:54.264
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm unwell.

00:54.684 --> 00:57.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody say hello to DarkSakura, also known as Manuel.

00:59.128 --> 01:01.890
[SPEAKER_09]: And the smartass over there in the corner, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

01:02.270 --> 01:02.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.451
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

01:03.991 --> 01:05.212
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fine.

01:05.252 --> 01:10.196
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm eating the large, unhealthy sandwich, as is tradition.

01:10.937 --> 01:12.778
[SPEAKER_09]: And what is this unhealthy sandwich that you're eating?

01:13.044 --> 01:18.107
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a grinder from our very, very discounted food chain Winco.

01:18.707 --> 01:22.869
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's basically an Italian sandwich on a loaf of garlic bread.

01:23.509 --> 01:24.190
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.230
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's called a grinder?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.131
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called a grinder.

01:28.732 --> 01:47.160
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, if you want to join us, the ever-present fourth guest on our show is the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us in our chat room and say hello because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

01:48.261 --> 01:51.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki is holding his sandwich up in the air like it's a victory pose.

01:51.862 --> 01:55.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he's He-Man or something.

01:55.244 --> 01:56.604
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the little Zelda noise.

01:57.565 --> 01:57.845
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so Loki, you didn't get to join us for the second E3 show.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, that was the last thing that was on the feed.

02:03.944 --> 02:08.929
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were off on Sunday because we had done the other E3 shows Tuesday and Wednesday.

02:09.309 --> 02:17.096
[SPEAKER_09]: You were here Wednesday when we talked about things like Skyrim and I believe that was the day that Miklatov had waited in line to play the Vita and so forth.

02:17.677 --> 02:21.841
[SPEAKER_09]: Any kind of closing thoughts from you for E3 since you didn't get your chance before, Loki?

02:22.982 --> 02:23.102
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

02:27.060 --> 02:40.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row is awesome I mean I don't know like the Playstation Vita I don't really care for I mean there's a lot of features to it which is kind of cool but

02:42.734 --> 02:44.756
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know if I really care about it too much.

02:44.796 --> 02:48.198
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not any games that jump out and say, oh my god, I gotta own that.

02:48.338 --> 02:50.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Uncharted.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.241
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm not a fan of the Uncharted series.

02:52.862 --> 02:55.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it's a bad series, but I just, I never played them.

02:56.164 --> 02:56.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

02:56.765 --> 02:58.626
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't really want to play them.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.007
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not enough time to play everything.

03:00.127 --> 03:00.548
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

03:00.568 --> 03:02.009
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't our day job, so.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.170
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.531
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looks good.

03:05.792 --> 03:11.136
[SPEAKER_02]: I was unaware, now I don't remember the whole entire feature list, but I guess those things have GPS built into them.

03:12.072 --> 03:14.416
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember that from the original unveiling.

03:14.776 --> 03:18.862
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw that because I'm setting up the items for it and they've got some games.

03:20.023 --> 03:20.704
[SPEAKER_02]: It breaks it down.

03:20.724 --> 03:25.871
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how in the back of those PlayStation boxes it's like, okay, you need such and such space for storage.

03:25.951 --> 03:26.632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one player.

03:26.712 --> 03:27.353
[SPEAKER_02]: It's online.

03:27.393 --> 03:28.034
[SPEAKER_02]: It's blah, blah, blah.

03:28.755 --> 03:32.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they actually break it down to what features of the Vita are actually used.

03:33.020 --> 03:40.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this uses the front touch, this uses the back touch, the tilt controls, the multi-touch on things, sliding your finger back.

03:40.769 --> 03:44.473
[SPEAKER_09]: So on a 1 to 10 on the gimmick meter, this game rates a 6 or a 7.

03:46.255 --> 03:48.797
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sure... Especially those launch games will make heavy use of gimmicks.

03:48.817 --> 03:56.141
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's going to be a lot of gimmicky stuff on there, but I think it's got potential as far as, you know, it's nice that that stuff is on there.

03:56.161 --> 04:01.604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, please, publishers, don't try to, you know, just make a bunch of gimmicky shit out of it.

04:01.624 --> 04:02.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Use it if it makes sense.

04:02.485 --> 04:02.905
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

04:02.965 --> 04:10.730
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't necessarily have to use the touchscreen for stuff you don't, you know, need to use it for.

04:10.770 --> 04:12.711
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, buttons work just as well.

04:12.771 --> 04:13.071
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

04:13.322 --> 04:20.467
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go to this comment from chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where, by the way, there's a lot of praise going on for your sandwich that sounds really good.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.328
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really good.

04:21.748 --> 04:22.809
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a picture of that.

04:22.849 --> 04:24.170
[SPEAKER_09]: That just looks like... That's a half.

04:24.290 --> 04:27.072
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like a heart attack that you're eating.

04:27.212 --> 04:28.233
[SPEAKER_02]: That's half a sandwich.

04:28.573 --> 04:29.134
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

04:30.114 --> 04:44.279
[SPEAKER_09]: So, going to chat room, BlackWolf starts us off tonight, and this is a quote I've heard him say several times, in fact, on his own show, and I don't remember if he said it on our E3 or whatever, but BlackWolf starts us off tonight saying, Saints Row is the video game version of what goes on in Loki's head.

04:44.799 --> 04:45.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

04:48.301 --> 04:50.902
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row is basically... Because, you know...

04:52.222 --> 04:58.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto 4 really was kind of a step away from the direction of Grand Theft Auto was kind of going.

04:58.647 --> 05:01.188
[SPEAKER_02]: San Andreas was just a really crazy game.

05:01.228 --> 05:02.649
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could do so much in there.

05:02.669 --> 05:03.670
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do pretty much anything.

05:04.050 --> 05:05.171
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you had girlfriends you could date.

05:05.191 --> 05:06.312
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go ride a bicycle.

05:06.352 --> 05:14.518
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do base jumping, swim in the ocean, fly jets, just wander around the desert, go gamble, whatever.

05:15.038 --> 05:17.480
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Rockstar's like, hey, you know what?

05:18.441 --> 05:19.823
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna make the game more realistic.

05:19.923 --> 05:24.392
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking out all the fun stuff, like the tanks, the flamethrowers, the miniguns.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.454
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking that all out.

05:25.474 --> 05:27.137
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just gonna make this game more realistic.

05:27.177 --> 05:30.844
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone was kinda like, eh, okay.

05:31.764 --> 05:37.649
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, as stuff, their expansions came out, you know, they started kind of bringing that over-the-top stuff back.

05:37.669 --> 05:40.591
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still nothing to what San Andreas was.

05:40.712 --> 05:45.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Saints Row was kind of crazy at the beginning, and then the second game was even crazier.

05:45.856 --> 05:57.786
[SPEAKER_02]: The third game was just, they basically, the developer was even, you know, quoted saying, before, you know, Saints Row, the, you know, activities and stuff were kind of over-the-top.

05:58.286 --> 06:00.649
[SPEAKER_02]: and Saints Row the Third were making everything over the top.

06:00.889 --> 06:08.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single situation that you're in, every single battle that you're fighting, the story, everything is going to be ridiculous, just over the top.

06:08.778 --> 06:11.441
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be telling yourself, I can't believe I'm doing this right now.

06:13.363 --> 06:20.546
[SPEAKER_02]: And just even watching the gameplay videos, and I've linked a ton of them on Twitter, it's just, it's awesome.

06:20.966 --> 06:24.628
[SPEAKER_02]: The only disappointment for me is the lack of multiplayer.

06:24.688 --> 06:31.390
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's two-player co-op in the single-player campaign, but I really wish there was a deathmatch or something.

06:31.410 --> 06:32.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you worried at all about this?

06:32.651 --> 06:34.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this notoriously happens at E3.

06:35.252 --> 06:40.154
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been doing a show for nine years now, and I think out of those nine years, we've gone to five or six E3s.

06:41.114 --> 06:47.417
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of those E3s, we tend to come out of there really liking one game, and then sometimes that game will come out and it sucks.

06:48.298 --> 06:49.658
[SPEAKER_02]: My case in point, Nintendogs.

06:49.678 --> 06:53.820
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so excited for Nintendogs when it came out, and it was over in 15 minutes.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you worried that's what's going to happen?

06:55.421 --> 07:00.263
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I am absolutely confident that it's going to be an awesome game, because the other games have been great.

07:01.044 --> 07:01.884
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.

07:03.505 --> 07:05.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row, when it first came out, I'm like, well...

07:05.686 --> 07:06.627
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:29.639 --> 07:30.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask this.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.661
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that good stuff.

07:32.721 --> 07:36.464
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just dying to ask this question to Loki since we're on the topic of Saints Row III.

07:36.604 --> 07:39.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, one of the big games that came out this week was Duke Nukem Forever.

07:39.926 --> 07:44.270
[SPEAKER_09]: And although I think it's on our show role to cover later in the show, it's no big surprise.

07:44.310 --> 07:49.013
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of you know Duke Nukem Forever has been really razzed in the gaming press as a whole.

07:49.553 --> 07:53.396
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of it has been about just how – it's almost like –

07:54.918 --> 08:00.805
[SPEAKER_09]: The sense of humor in the game is to that point where it's like the guy that's so drunk, he's getting really awkward with his humor.

08:01.126 --> 08:04.370
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people are really saying the humor kind of steps over a line in this game.

08:04.971 --> 08:09.617
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet, some of those same people are really excited the way you are about Saints Row the Third.

08:09.937 --> 08:10.658
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think there's...

08:11.679 --> 08:15.641
[SPEAKER_09]: A discrepancy, a bit of hypocrisy going on right now in the mainstream gaming press.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not hypocrisy, it's just the way they're describing the game is a little inaccurate.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the problem with Duke Nukem Forever.

08:22.424 --> 08:28.547
[SPEAKER_02]: My main two problems with it right now, and I'm not that far into the game, are... One, the game looks very muddy.

08:28.948 --> 08:30.548
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics are very brown.

08:30.568 --> 08:34.931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know a lot of shooters out there tend to kind of go with the brown color palette, but this looks like...

08:35.851 --> 08:38.573
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a decent-looking game, and then they just splat poo all over it.

08:38.974 --> 08:48.102
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just very dark, and even when you're playing it in HD and stuff, it looks like you're playing it on a really low-res screen or something.

08:48.122 --> 08:52.145
[SPEAKER_09]: The colors just look very... Did Duke literally splash poo on them?

08:52.205 --> 08:54.807
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I saw in the demo, you can do that now.

08:55.988 --> 08:59.251
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan was playing it and making me watch, and I was like, really?

09:00.212 --> 09:00.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

09:01.353 --> 09:01.913
[SPEAKER_09]: You can fling poo?

09:01.933 --> 09:02.974
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, that's the problem, though.

09:03.034 --> 09:03.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke knew...

09:03.815 --> 09:04.715
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

09:26.980 --> 09:27.581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not funny.

09:27.741 --> 09:30.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, haha, all those shooters are crap, so we're going to make our game crap too.

09:30.943 --> 09:32.204
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

09:32.284 --> 09:32.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you do that?

09:33.425 --> 09:34.726
[SPEAKER_02]: And the load time is terrible.

09:34.806 --> 09:38.569
[SPEAKER_02]: The load time for the game is just ridiculously awful.

09:39.049 --> 09:43.733
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just screams to me that they just really rushed their way through this game.

09:43.753 --> 09:44.813
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of think that they did.

09:44.873 --> 09:46.615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they went through the motions of everything.

09:47.035 --> 09:51.919
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the first two levels that I played through it so far...

09:53.880 --> 09:54.981
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:23.706 --> 10:25.067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of pointless.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.509
[SPEAKER_02]: They spent all their time making all this stuff work.

10:28.049 --> 10:32.092
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like the version of what we really want to do in Sony PlayStation Home.

10:32.933 --> 10:43.000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they took a really run-down car that's just completely broken, and they put shiny rims on it, and they want to make sure those rims are extra polished.

10:43.080 --> 10:49.045
[SPEAKER_02]: So they spent all their time polishing those rims to make them the shiniest rims you've ever seen, but the car is shit.

10:49.977 --> 10:51.078
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

11:08.937 --> 11:09.938
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:26.818 --> 11:34.901
[SPEAKER_09]: You see, I think it's, and I think this is obvious, I'm probably stating the obvious here, but I think it's a gross misinterpretation to say this game was in development for 12 years.

11:35.061 --> 11:35.481
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't.

11:35.781 --> 11:37.422
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea's been kicked around for 12 years.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.682
[SPEAKER_09]: This game has really been in development for like a year and a half.

11:40.363 --> 11:41.263
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's terrible, though.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe some art, some things on paper, but come on.

11:44.984 --> 11:47.325
[SPEAKER_02]: But come on, I've seen games at this company.

11:47.445 --> 11:48.585
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out Borderlands.

11:48.825 --> 11:49.965
[SPEAKER_02]: Borderlands was awesome.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that damn engine and put it into Duke Nukem.

11:52.966 --> 11:53.926
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need to do.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Just redo the assets and it's perfect.

11:56.327 --> 12:00.308
[SPEAKER_09]: SalaciousPop is asking, Loki, the 360 or the PS3 console version?

12:00.588 --> 12:05.469
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the PS3 version is allegedly a leaps and bounds better port and the 360 one is toilet.

12:05.609 --> 12:05.889
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the 360.

12:07.049 --> 12:07.349
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

12:07.830 --> 12:08.050
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.411
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that the graphics are that different.

12:10.451 --> 12:11.832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the color palette and load time.

12:12.492 --> 12:17.335
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott Pilgrim in our chat says, Gearbox said that they were going to make the game and nothing about it being a spectacular game.

12:18.175 --> 12:19.256
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, then why even bother?

12:19.556 --> 12:22.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Why even bother if you're going to, oh, well, we're just going to finish it.

12:22.378 --> 12:23.899
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're going to do a shitty job.

12:24.199 --> 12:26.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you put your name on it then if that's what you're going to do?

12:26.780 --> 12:34.765
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to just sit there and poop out a game that, you know, was half done and you're just going to kind of patch it all together to make sure it works.

12:35.405 --> 12:36.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you even bother doing that?

12:36.887 --> 12:38.088
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we did it for the fans.

12:38.128 --> 12:39.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the fans really want a shitty game.

12:39.730 --> 12:42.472
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they've been waiting 13 years for, is a really shitty game.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.896
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go to this last comment from our chatroom, and then we'll go to our gaming weeks.

12:46.236 --> 12:51.341
[SPEAKER_09]: KaiJudo in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, I want to know who thought this game was going to be good.

12:51.641 --> 12:53.423
[SPEAKER_09]: They delayed it 12 years for a reason.

12:53.724 --> 12:57.968
[SPEAKER_09]: The game would have not seen the light of day if gamers weren't crying about it for all these years.

12:58.188 --> 12:58.649
[SPEAKER_02]: No, exactly.

12:58.729 --> 13:03.277
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was going to be good, but those are my two complaints.

13:03.438 --> 13:05.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Muddy, long load time.

13:06.408 --> 13:10.091
[SPEAKER_09]: Disclaimer, I haven't played the game yet, so I don't have an opinion on it one way or the other.

13:10.151 --> 13:14.334
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can read the reviews, but I also know not to always trust reviews because they're sometimes wrong.

13:15.394 --> 13:19.717
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, about a game that I'm going to get into later during my gaming week, I think a lot of review sites got it wrong.

13:20.458 --> 13:31.845
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyhow, as far as Duke Nukem Forever goes, you know, I think a big part of the reason it came out was because of its legend status that it had in the gaming community.

13:31.885 --> 13:34.107
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the game you will never get to play.

13:34.727 --> 13:35.588
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously,

13:36.588 --> 13:36.948
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

13:56.670 --> 14:03.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to go back to two weeks worth of gaming, I played Kix at Flynn's and Space Paranoids and Tron.

14:04.094 --> 14:10.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Space Paranoids is funny because Space Paranoids, which is an arcade game that I believe you can only play at Electronica.

14:10.418 --> 14:11.359
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's where the only thing is.

14:11.899 --> 14:17.803
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sitting amongst all these 80s arcades games, and it's made to look like an 80s arcade game, but it's not.

14:18.003 --> 14:20.664
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something that was made kind of newer.

14:20.744 --> 14:23.526
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's running on a PC, clearly, but it's in a cabinet.

14:23.806 --> 14:24.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

14:24.246 --> 14:24.947
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting.

14:25.367 --> 14:26.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what it was for.

14:27.369 --> 14:34.234
[SPEAKER_05]: But it makes sense that they'd put it in with Electronica because, I mean, it was the big game when the first Tron came out, you know, in the movie.

14:34.454 --> 14:37.497
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and Disney's very about getting you in the experience.

14:37.597 --> 14:41.920
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like when you go on Space Mountain, you are boarding a spaceship and about to go through the galaxy.

14:42.281 --> 14:43.722
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Mountain is not a roller coaster.

14:43.762 --> 14:46.124
[SPEAKER_09]: If a Disney employee ever called it a roller coaster, they'd be sacked.

14:46.684 --> 14:47.404
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a spaceship.

14:47.804 --> 14:48.785
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how it works.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.326
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you go to Flynn's Arcade, I mean, it's very much a detail thing.

14:52.366 --> 14:57.328
[SPEAKER_09]: And because Space Paranoids was a game that Kevin Flynn, that's what he made all his money developing, right?

14:57.748 --> 15:00.989
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to make it to be true in that experience.

15:01.269 --> 15:06.131
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to me, technically, Dillinger stole it from him and made all the money and then, yeah, just watched it.

15:06.151 --> 15:06.771
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, blah, blah.

15:06.791 --> 15:07.412
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fine.

15:07.432 --> 15:08.712
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my favorite Disney movie.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.596
[SPEAKER_05]: We are... Crap, what else did I play?

15:14.597 --> 15:16.639
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, BlackWolf says you can actually play it online as well.

15:16.939 --> 15:18.901
[SPEAKER_09]: SpacePiranoidsOnline.com Thank you.

15:21.824 --> 15:22.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Played some WoW.

15:23.686 --> 15:25.007
[SPEAKER_05]: I played VVVVVV.

15:25.528 --> 15:26.689
[SPEAKER_05]: Game's frustrating as hell.

15:27.057 --> 15:29.198
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear it's a really well-received indie title, though.

15:29.218 --> 15:30.118
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it myself.

15:30.318 --> 15:30.838
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.

15:30.878 --> 15:31.659
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you do in that game?

15:32.579 --> 15:35.940
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't necessarily have a jump as much as you have a reverse gravity.

15:36.780 --> 15:39.381
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to get over traps, you have to play with gravity.

15:39.401 --> 15:41.822
[SPEAKER_05]: You're either walking on the bottom or you're walking on the ceiling.

15:42.082 --> 15:42.742
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds kind of neat.

15:43.123 --> 15:45.463
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, but it's frustrating and a little difficult.

15:46.204 --> 15:47.464
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a little bit to get used to.

15:47.484 --> 15:53.066
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Peggle and played some Portal.

15:54.485 --> 15:56.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal 2, of course, right?

16:12.523 --> 16:18.610
[SPEAKER_05]: I can read enough in that to get an idea of what menu is what, but it's very Japanese intensive.

16:19.030 --> 16:22.093
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good though, but only has like two songs in it in one story mode.

16:22.113 --> 16:26.778
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's got like, I think two extra tracks than what the arcade version has.

16:27.659 --> 16:30.863
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the arcade version is the fourth stage game.

16:31.303 --> 16:34.466
[SPEAKER_09]: All I can say is hooray for region-free PlayStation, right?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.567
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can do that stuff.

16:36.608 --> 16:37.909
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

16:38.329 --> 16:45.116
[SPEAKER_05]: But it gave him an excuse to bring back out the rig that he bought for Gran Turismo.

16:47.177 --> 16:51.722
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually works really good for the PS2 initial D game.

16:52.542 --> 16:53.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Just thought I would point that out.

16:56.846 --> 16:57.186
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

16:59.358 --> 17:00.699
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's really about it.

17:00.979 --> 17:06.242
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I played some other stuff, but my brain's not working, so... I'm just gonna say stuff.

17:07.163 --> 17:08.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go... Oh!

17:08.944 --> 17:10.164
[SPEAKER_05]: World Cup Soccer Pinball.

17:10.404 --> 17:10.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

17:11.165 --> 17:11.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

17:12.426 --> 17:12.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

17:12.986 --> 17:15.828
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to Loki, and how was your gaming week?

17:16.468 --> 17:17.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously you've played some Duke Nukem.

17:18.629 --> 17:19.029
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

17:19.590 --> 17:21.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little bit of Duke Nukem.

17:23.412 --> 17:26.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much just... You know, a little bit of Duke Nukem.

17:27.514 --> 17:27.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

17:29.389 --> 17:31.915
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of, well, lots of Grand Theft Auto.

17:32.776 --> 17:33.378
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um...

17:35.148 --> 17:35.928
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

17:36.008 --> 17:37.549
[SPEAKER_09]: I really didn't play a whole lot.

17:38.289 --> 17:38.629
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Not every week can be so exciting.

17:42.091 --> 17:45.212
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually kind of had one of those weeks where I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.833
[SPEAKER_09]: The only new game I played is not new.

17:48.313 --> 17:56.676
[SPEAKER_09]: I played LittleBigPlanet on the PSP because obviously this is one of the free games that they're giving away as part of the whole Welcome Back program.

17:56.716 --> 18:01.378
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was one of the ones I chose to get because I love the original on PlayStation 3.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.259
[SPEAKER_09]: So I decided to get this one.

18:03.439 --> 18:03.819
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not

18:03.899 --> 18:06.020
[SPEAKER_09]: All the levels so far seem to be pretty faithfully recreated.

18:28.889 --> 18:32.212
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really got into the whole online stuff and the levels on there.

18:32.432 --> 18:34.854
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I can't even access that yet.

18:36.195 --> 18:43.681
[SPEAKER_09]: I was starting to wonder for a minute if they're even there, but there's a planet for download levels, so I'll have to look into that a little more later on and how all that works.

18:43.921 --> 18:46.944
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't really review the game, but I did play it for about an hour or so.

18:47.584 --> 19:09.338
[SPEAKER_09]: but the game I've been spending most of my time with I actually revisited a game that I started playing about 15 months ago but I never finished and I think part of it was just at that time I was really heavy into WoW and I wasn't really playing any other games and then I loaned my copy of it to DarkSakura for like a year so I just got it back when we got back from the Disneyland trip this past Sunday and that's Final Fantasy XIII

19:10.579 --> 19:32.084
[SPEAKER_09]: and I have I started over on Final Fantasy 13 because I'm one of those people that with an RPG if I can't remember the story and where I was at then screw it I'm starting over and so I started the entire game over and I have spent more time in the past week playing it than I did in its original run when I first played it uh I'm already past the point where I was before so

19:33.084 --> 19:34.445
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been having a lot of fun with that game.

19:56.432 --> 19:59.174
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the strengths of Final Fantasy XIII for me, of course, is the battle system.

19:59.454 --> 20:00.694
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the battle system in XIII.

20:00.714 --> 20:01.535
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of my favorites.

20:01.555 --> 20:04.376
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the whole paradigm shifts into the different classes.

20:04.696 --> 20:14.582
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've never played, the battle system in XIII is like, you know, you can be a black mage one minute, and then you do, like, a paradigm shift, and suddenly you're more of a buffing or debuff mage.

20:14.762 --> 20:16.863
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I guess that would be like a... What are those?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.744
[SPEAKER_09]: The green mages, I think, that did a lot of that in V?

20:20.005 --> 20:49.086
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you know you can switch again and you're more of like a warrior it's pretty cool just flipping back and forth in the different battles I really like that and then a lot of people bitching about the characters in the game as well and I think again you know if you stick with it a lot of the characters don't end up so one dimensional if you play the game for more than 10 hours of gameplay you know some of the characters like the kids are the ones that usually get a lot of hate Hope and Vanille and those two characters are

20:49.866 --> 20:54.369
[SPEAKER_09]: Get much more rounded out as you continue on with the game.

20:54.429 --> 20:56.371
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's worth it if you stick with it.

20:56.731 --> 21:03.075
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, I also understand why if a game doesn't grab you right away, you're not so inclined to want to stick with it.

21:03.596 --> 21:08.419
[SPEAKER_09]: I think visually, graphically, and sound-wise, there's enough to keep me entertained.

21:08.759 --> 21:12.602
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the graphics in this game are so freaking gorgeous.

21:12.782 --> 21:14.403
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even explain.

21:14.723 --> 21:16.965
[SPEAKER_09]: You just like to watch pretty things.

21:17.005 --> 21:19.046
[SPEAKER_09]: There's plenty here to keep you entertained for a while.

21:19.766 --> 21:25.792
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think part of the big motivator why I wanted to go back and play this game was just hearing about Final Fantasy XIII-2 from E3.

21:25.832 --> 21:31.156
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like in this game they have really addressed a lot of the things that people didn't like about the first game.

21:31.396 --> 21:37.021
[SPEAKER_09]: Like one of the things I noticed right off the bat were maps, even in the little trailer, that were not linear.

21:37.442 --> 21:40.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Maps that showed big environments and open worlds.

21:40.764 --> 21:45.489
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a feeling XIII-2 is really going to correct what a lot of people didn't like about XIII-2.

21:46.209 --> 21:49.734
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to be able to understand the story, so I wanted to actually just play through 13.

21:49.834 --> 21:52.518
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I could have just read spoilers, but I didn't really want to.

21:52.899 --> 21:53.660
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to play it.

21:54.742 --> 21:55.222
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I'm at.

21:55.302 --> 21:56.043
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't beat it yet.

21:56.324 --> 21:57.566
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully by this time next week.

21:57.766 --> 21:58.106
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

21:58.247 --> 21:59.829
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know if I'm halfway through yet, though.

21:59.849 --> 22:00.830
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about...

22:02.768 --> 22:26.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Chapter 9 or so So, anyhow That's it for my gaming week At least all is notable Of course I play more WoW and things like that too But that's all I'll mention on tonight's show So, let's move on to some housekeeping Then we'll get into the news tonight One big thing, of course, I wanted to say in the housekeeping tonight was Happy Father's Day To all the gamer dads out there Which would include Loki Yeah, it's your first Father's Day, right?

22:27.186 --> 22:29.248
[SPEAKER_09]: So, congratulations to you on that

22:29.808 --> 22:31.351
[SPEAKER_05]: What all chores did you get to do today?

22:31.431 --> 22:33.034
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what chores did you make your son do today?

22:33.054 --> 22:33.735
[SPEAKER_02]: How many diapers?

22:34.576 --> 22:38.122
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to watch the baby all day and take my wife out to lunch.

22:39.881 --> 22:41.302
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry, I said take my wife out for lunch.

22:43.003 --> 22:43.203
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

22:43.984 --> 22:47.587
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at chat.orangelunchradio.com, some comments on Final Fantasy XIII.

22:47.947 --> 22:51.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott Pilgrim says, but Sky, the game gives you a brief recap, though.

22:51.610 --> 22:55.813
[SPEAKER_09]: It does, and the data log is very impressive, but I don't know.

22:56.093 --> 22:58.975
[SPEAKER_09]: I still just, I wanted to start from scratch, so I did.

22:59.155 --> 23:01.116
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured it wouldn't take me that long to catch up, and it didn't.

23:02.338 --> 23:07.609
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, on the Father's Day topic too, of course, happy Father's Day to all the gamer dads out there or father figures.

23:07.949 --> 23:12.900
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have someone out there that considers you their dad, then happy Father's Day to you.

23:13.652 --> 23:17.534
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio.

23:17.554 --> 23:20.176
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash olr.

23:20.256 --> 23:23.398
[SPEAKER_09]: And visit our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

23:23.978 --> 23:25.879
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice if we had more posts in the forums there.

23:26.599 --> 23:30.141
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news.

23:30.362 --> 23:31.722
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll start off with Loki.

23:32.463 --> 23:32.923
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

23:33.323 --> 23:33.724
[SPEAKER_02]: News.

23:33.824 --> 23:37.005
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we're going to start off talking about Wii U and some of the...

23:38.566 --> 23:39.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

24:02.251 --> 24:17.919
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, apparently the Wii U console will be using a custom Radeon GPU with a chip similar to the R770, basically a chip that's found in some of the last generation ATI cards.

24:18.820 --> 24:27.430
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the 770 is in the 4870, which is a decent card.

24:27.470 --> 24:33.237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than some of the stuff they have right now in the current-gen consoles.

24:35.459 --> 24:43.266
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's good, but who knows, you know, by the time that these next-gen consoles come out, you know, what they're going to be packing.

24:43.486 --> 24:50.032
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will be able to hold up with at least the 360 and PS3 and may even be able to push better graphics than that, so that's kind of cool.

24:52.950 --> 25:05.374
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, also, it came out that the Wii U will not have a DVD or Blu-ray playback, mainly because it will actually be used in its own proprietary disc format.

25:06.294 --> 25:19.338
[SPEAKER_02]: And there also explains, well, Wii U doesn't have DVD or Blu-ray playback capabilities because the cost, and also they figured that enough people already have devices that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Good decision on Nintendo's part, or bad?

25:23.446 --> 25:37.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's probably true to a certain extent, and also I think it helps them as far as piracy goes, because if it's their own disc format, you can't pop it, you know, if it's unable to read DVDs, you can't burn a game onto a DVD.

25:38.202 --> 25:45.210
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, in the case, I mean, these games are going to be multiple gigabytes anyways, but you can't burn a Blu-ray backup or something like that.

25:46.454 --> 25:48.135
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to use its own little format there.

25:48.155 --> 25:49.996
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to rip it off a hard drive.

25:53.298 --> 25:55.060
[SPEAKER_09]: At first I was surprised.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.542
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, wow, they're not going to support a movie format.

25:58.562 --> 25:59.563
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of shocking.

25:59.583 --> 26:03.385
[SPEAKER_09]: But then at the same time I was like, well, what Nintendo console really did support a movie format?

26:03.465 --> 26:06.027
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, GameCube didn't even play CDs.

26:06.747 --> 26:12.291
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii certainly doesn't play DVDs unless I guess you do some hacking with it, which doesn't really count.

26:13.551 --> 26:17.493
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does Netflix, and I'm sure this new system is going to do the Netflix and the Hulu and all that.

26:17.993 --> 26:23.396
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess now we're in a different spot with our movies than we were 10 years ago.

26:23.416 --> 26:29.558
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a lot of people that rely on things like Netflix and Hulu and all the other download things to get their movies.

26:29.598 --> 26:34.700
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think as long as Nintendo supports Netflix, which I'm sure it will, I think that's going to be enough.

26:34.740 --> 26:35.601
[SPEAKER_09]: That's probably all it needs.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.041
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the Wii was the best-selling system.

26:37.081 --> 26:37.962
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't even play DVDs.

26:38.542 --> 26:44.787
[SPEAKER_09]: I always thought it was a little weird to hear that Nintendo might go Blu-ray, because Blu-ray is a Sony format, and I always thought that was a little weird.

26:45.708 --> 26:52.534
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you can't really, I mean, they have their own proprietary format right now, but I don't know, it's...

26:53.516 --> 26:56.459
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of either have to make your own or use theirs.

27:16.078 --> 27:17.619
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's what you're going to get for Christmas this year.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.173
[SPEAKER_09]: is coming out.

27:41.033 --> 27:44.235
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, Kirby is supposed to be in the fall, out at some point.

27:44.776 --> 27:49.419
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other games that are coming from Nintendo, they're putting out on the Wii.

27:49.739 --> 27:52.061
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Play Motion on June 13th.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.723
[SPEAKER_09]: Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave incident, on June 27th.

27:56.404 --> 27:57.565
[SPEAKER_09]: Kirby Wii is in the fall.

27:57.965 --> 27:59.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortune Street will be during the holiday.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Zelda Skyward Sword.

28:02.208 --> 28:06.751
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Mario Party 9 and Rhythm Heaven on the Wii are announced for later this year.

28:07.411 --> 28:09.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out from Nintendo on the DS later this year.

28:09.873 --> 28:11.254
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the 3DS, but the DS.

28:11.635 --> 28:20.301
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Quest Monsters, Joker 2, Kirby Mass Attack, Professor Layton and the Last Spectre for the fall, and Super Fossil Fighters over the holiday.

28:21.002 --> 28:23.664
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other releases on the Wii, let me just kind of throw it out there.

28:23.724 --> 28:27.727
[SPEAKER_09]: From Sega, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

28:27.767 --> 28:29.509
[SPEAKER_09]: That will be in November.

28:30.609 --> 28:59.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Ubisoft is putting out more game show ports Family Feud 2012 and Price is Right Decades in September Just Dance 3 in the fall WB Interactive has some movie tie-in games also the Sesame Street franchise going on there and then lastly Konami has Dance Dance Revolution 2 in the fall and what's sure to be a favorite here at OLR Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3 in the fall

28:59.798 --> 29:00.598
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

29:01.899 --> 29:02.059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

29:02.820 --> 29:05.021
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, how about the 3DS?

29:05.281 --> 29:14.486
[SPEAKER_09]: And moving forward, obviously the 3DS needs some bigger games in order to make people really want to get it because the launch titles have not been that great.

29:14.806 --> 29:19.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, Zelda's out now, which of course was released today.

29:19.408 --> 29:24.651
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was one of the big releases and there's a lot of people probably going to jump on board finally for that game.

29:25.091 --> 29:52.186
[SPEAKER_09]: but if not Zelda then maybe Star Fox 64 3D which is dated for September 11th yeah it's Loki's birthday Kid Icarus will be during the holiday as will Mario Kart and Super Mario however you'll have to wait until 2012 to play Lego City Stories and Luigi's Mansion 2 not dated yet Animal Crossing and Paper Mario so I would assume those games are all the way out next summer would be my guess so

29:52.967 --> 30:13.608
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other things that are coming out on the 3DS Ubisoft is putting out all that crap that they put out on the DS That sells millions Pets Fantasy, Horses 3D, Imagine Babies 3D Raving Rabbids 5, maybe a little more in the direction of stuff we'd actually play Is coming out on the 3DS as well

30:13.928 --> 30:29.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami's putting out Frogger 3D in the fall They've dated Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater for the winter Majesco's got Cooking Mama 4, Kitchen Magic slated for October 11th Capcom's got Resident Evil The Mercenaries dated June 28th I didn't realize that was coming out so soon

30:30.229 --> 30:49.146
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Evil Revelations is a little further out and then lastly from Activision they've got Spider-Man in the fall and a Transformers game to support the movie in June so there is lots of stuff for the 3DS from the various third parties as well as Nintendo themselves all the way through the rest of the year so DarkSakura going back to the Wii U

30:50.187 --> 30:56.949
[SPEAKER_05]: In other Wii U news, they are only doing one controller for it because of some cost issue.

30:57.649 --> 31:04.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Iwata said that they don't want buyers to have to buy multiple Wii U controllers.

31:05.451 --> 31:17.374
[SPEAKER_05]: And by putting in different aspects of multiplayer that would involve the controller, they would be pretty much insisting that people buy another Wii U controller and they were trying to cut down costs for the consumer.

31:18.575 --> 31:20.740
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of don't see where that matters.

31:21.622 --> 31:27.614
[SPEAKER_05]: I think just put in a strong single player and then, you know, later on add in

31:29.611 --> 31:32.975
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the problem, in my opinion, is that the Wii is a party system.

31:33.476 --> 31:37.700
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii, especially when it first came out, was that system that got busted out at all the parties.

31:37.741 --> 31:38.862
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's play Wii Tennis.

31:38.962 --> 31:40.143
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's play Mario Party.

31:40.203 --> 31:42.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's play, you know, Smash Brothers, whatever the game was.

31:42.686 --> 31:45.530
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very much about a lot of those multiplayer experiences.

31:45.930 --> 31:48.933
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's very surprising that they've kind of said, well...

31:49.514 --> 31:54.937
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiplayer is not really going to be like that on the Wii U. I mean, granted, you will be able to use the Wiimote.

31:54.977 --> 31:57.158
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be able to use the classic controller.

31:57.498 --> 32:00.839
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not like multiplayer experiences will be non-existent.

32:02.080 --> 32:15.807
[SPEAKER_09]: But when this controller is such a huge factor of what they're trying to drive, it's interesting that there's not going to be a thing where I could bring my Wii U controller over to someone else's house and play on that controller.

32:16.877 --> 32:23.220
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's also not surprising because remember that controller is not a processor.

32:23.781 --> 32:28.183
[SPEAKER_09]: The image that you see on that Wii U controller is not being processed by the controller.

32:28.503 --> 32:38.348
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the biggest difference between the Wii U setup and what you've probably most familiar with leading into this would be the GameCube going to the Game Boy Advance.

32:38.368 --> 32:40.349
[SPEAKER_09]: Those Game Boy Advances had processors in them.

32:40.690 --> 32:44.732
[SPEAKER_09]: They could process the data and so forth but the Wii U is all streaming from the box.

32:45.572 --> 32:54.837
[SPEAKER_09]: So it makes sense that it can't maybe stream to more than one, although I think I read somewhere where it is actually capable of streaming to more than one, but it won't be as good.

32:55.297 --> 32:59.059
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but it's going to be interesting.

32:59.159 --> 33:08.324
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there will be plenty of multiplayer experiences with the Classic Controller involved, and certainly all the demos they were showing were just the one and the Wiimotes, but...

33:09.484 --> 33:14.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a little disappointing to know that they're not going to try and do more.

33:14.469 --> 33:16.692
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess it would be expensive to do that.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.094
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these controllers are probably going to be like $100.

33:19.154 --> 33:23.799
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know they've said they're not going to sell them separately, but what if I lose mine?

33:24.239 --> 33:24.299
[SPEAKER_09]: Or...

33:26.161 --> 33:41.916
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly don't think the controllers are going to be about $100 a pop I really don't think so I think you're maybe looking at especially since it itself doesn't contain the processor I think you're really going to be looking at more around $50 for the controller

33:43.337 --> 33:47.479
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru in our chatroom says, I think this will kill the Wii U more than anything else.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.401
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, at the end of the day, it's really all about the games.

33:51.481 --> 34:00.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I have a really hard time being able to assess Wii U right now because, you know, sure, I saw E3 like you guys did and, you know, I see the controller and so forth and the demos.

34:01.046 --> 34:02.007
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, they're not...

34:03.187 --> 34:05.189
[SPEAKER_09]: No real games were shown.

34:05.669 --> 34:14.695
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe like a couple of very loose conceptual things like Ghost Recon and what have you, but I'm sorry, there's not enough of what are the games really going to look like on this thing?

34:15.015 --> 34:17.517
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think we're really going to know that answer until next E3.

34:17.637 --> 34:20.359
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like I can't really judge the system.

34:21.019 --> 34:23.821
[SPEAKER_09]: until I see how does this really play out?

34:24.201 --> 34:27.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Or have they been able to think around these constraints really well?

34:27.944 --> 34:35.649
[SPEAKER_09]: And to Nintendo's credit, I think that's one thing they do really well is that they design awesome games for the confines that they've built.

34:36.729 --> 34:37.190
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

34:37.290 --> 34:39.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, Congratulations, Nintendo.

34:39.731 --> 34:42.653
[SPEAKER_09]: You defeated the entire purpose to buy this console for its controller.

34:42.974 --> 34:47.016
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine what families with multiple kids in it fighting over this controller?

34:47.797 --> 34:47.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

34:48.510 --> 34:55.631
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly think that's going to be the big reveal before it's released is that you get one of the Wii U controllers but you can also use your other I think that's going to be the big thing

35:18.427 --> 35:18.747
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.210
[SPEAKER_02]: It can do Miis.

35:42.490 --> 35:43.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

35:43.692 --> 35:45.133
[SPEAKER_02]: So can the normal Wii.

35:45.333 --> 35:46.555
[SPEAKER_02]: Why even show that off?

35:46.715 --> 35:47.475
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just stupid.

35:47.556 --> 35:54.843
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Chase Mii and the Shield stuff will ultimately get slapped into some minigame collection that is what the system will come with.

35:55.584 --> 35:56.685
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii U Party or something like that.

35:56.705 --> 35:59.868
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, all the tech demos are going to be in the fucking... They're going to be sold at some point.

36:00.249 --> 36:01.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're not going to sell these games.

36:01.630 --> 36:02.491
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't real games.

36:03.283 --> 36:06.949
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're going to sell these games because this is what you do, Nintendo.

36:07.510 --> 36:10.035
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, hmm, how can we get away with the least amount of work?

36:10.055 --> 36:12.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we made these tech demos and we're just sitting on them.

36:12.519 --> 36:15.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put them together and charge 50 bucks for them.

36:15.684 --> 36:17.127
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll throw in a Wiimote.

36:17.369 --> 36:19.511
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to the Weasley School of Test Design.

36:21.292 --> 36:22.032
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wheatley School.

36:22.873 --> 36:28.036
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that Nintendo, they still have a long time before this comes out.

36:28.157 --> 36:31.259
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think they're going to have a lot of time to respond to some of this criticism.

36:31.679 --> 36:40.045
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could definitely see Reggie coming out on stage at the next E3 saying, well, we heard a lot about this that you guys didn't like, so we did this.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.246
[SPEAKER_09]: And what was it he said?

36:42.286 --> 36:43.127
[SPEAKER_09]: Contradictions?

36:43.567 --> 36:44.248
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do that.

36:44.648 --> 36:45.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

37:12.042 --> 37:37.481
[SPEAKER_09]: we know nothing about online that's the thing I can't sit here and tell you I'm going to buy a Wii U or I'm not going to buy a Wii U and I don't think honestly any of you can sit here and tell me that you are or you aren't buying one because we don't really know we have an idea we've got the idea we see the direction Nintendo's going but we don't see the path and I think they've got a year to really impress us next E3 I'll tell you

37:38.632 --> 37:40.433
[SPEAKER_09]: If I think the Wii U is for me or not.

37:41.554 --> 37:42.054
[SPEAKER_09]: What, Loki?

37:42.074 --> 37:42.815
[SPEAKER_09]: You're laughing over there.

37:42.835 --> 37:45.656
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like thinking, you know, the direction that they're gonna come out.

37:45.797 --> 37:49.239
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gonna be the same old shit with another gimmick attached to it.

37:49.679 --> 37:51.100
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what it really is gonna end up.

37:51.160 --> 38:01.526
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna take you through this elaborate path of promises and hopes and stuff and then we're gonna just get right back to the Wii with a gimmicky piece of shit that's now another controller for it.

38:02.847 --> 38:04.348
[SPEAKER_09]: People love gimmicky pieces of shit.

38:04.508 --> 38:06.229
[SPEAKER_09]: Why else is the Wii been the number one console?

38:06.389 --> 38:06.990
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one!

38:08.575 --> 38:11.376
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

38:37.330 --> 38:53.026
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta read, there's actually a couple really good comments in chat I want to get here, now we get some stuff on the Wii U here Scott Pilgrim says, I'll buy a Wii U when Mario Kart comes out, if that GameGuru says, all of them will be put into Wii U Sports and be packaged with the console, save New Super Mario Bros.

38:53.086 --> 38:56.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Me which will come out separately and sell like 20 million copies

38:56.790 --> 39:00.693
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says, I felt Nintendo was forced into announcing the Wii U right now.

39:01.053 --> 39:03.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Developers were working on games for it and was starting to leak out.

39:04.275 --> 39:07.678
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to talk about it this E3 because they wanted to put their spin on it.

39:07.978 --> 39:11.020
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think about it, they did the same thing with the Wii Revolution.

39:11.941 --> 39:12.901
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

39:13.282 --> 39:15.763
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it was too early, but I understand they had to.

39:15.944 --> 39:16.404
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to.

39:16.644 --> 39:17.244
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they didn't.

39:17.725 --> 39:18.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did they have to?

39:18.565 --> 39:20.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it would have been leaked out otherwise.

39:20.046 --> 39:20.847
[SPEAKER_09]: It was already leaked out.

39:20.867 --> 39:22.068
[SPEAKER_09]: We all knew it was a touchpad.

39:22.608 --> 39:23.149
[SPEAKER_09]: We all knew.

39:23.169 --> 39:23.409
[SPEAKER_09]: So what?

39:24.858 --> 39:25.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

39:25.438 --> 39:26.520
[SPEAKER_02]: So what if something leaks out?

39:26.540 --> 39:27.922
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go and confirm it.

39:28.804 --> 39:29.865
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just be motivated.

39:29.946 --> 39:32.049
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still a wise corporate policy.

39:32.069 --> 39:35.594
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to convince the world that they're on to the next video.

39:35.695 --> 39:36.997
[SPEAKER_02]: They want their stocks to go up.

39:37.057 --> 39:37.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that didn't work.

39:39.080 --> 39:39.681
[SPEAKER_02]: It went down.

39:39.961 --> 39:50.334
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever I come just looking from a corporate point of view, they have a product there that they don't want misperceptions on.

39:50.534 --> 39:55.801
[SPEAKER_05]: They want people to see it the way they want people to see it, not just with speculation.

39:57.199 --> 39:58.280
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:20.712 --> 40:28.035
[SPEAKER_09]: People by far out of this E3 are talking about Wii U and then probably in a, you know, distant second, the Vita.

40:28.776 --> 40:34.078
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in a, Microsoft doesn't even chart with what they showed.

40:34.238 --> 40:35.699
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to the gamers, yeah.

40:35.759 --> 40:38.660
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Halo 4, I guess, would be maybe like a way distant third.

40:38.920 --> 41:05.770
[SPEAKER_09]: whoopity shit that's what I say about Halo 4 and I'm not knocking Microsoft I'm just saying they didn't show anything at the press conference that really has people buzzing but of course they didn't show a new console although they did show that whole cable TV thing which I thought was going to be a lot bigger deal than it seems to be but whatever anyhow if it was leaked out not on their terms then it would have been misconstrued and confused so what Jamie said

41:07.841 --> 41:09.103
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says, I'm not sure.

41:09.143 --> 41:13.427
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on if the Wii U's uniqueness can overshadow Kinect among the casuals.

41:14.028 --> 41:19.774
[SPEAKER_09]: DoomPlague in chat.orangehustler.com says, they needed to get the attention of publishers, developers on board.

41:20.134 --> 41:23.158
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the whole point of showing the Wii U, in my opinion.

41:23.678 --> 41:24.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.441
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about something that's not Nintendo.

41:26.761 --> 41:30.105
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a three hour show, but there's plenty of other news going on too.

41:30.734 --> 41:41.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Bungie is celebrating their 20th anniversary, and of course they're going to reveal some new things about Bungie, including this Bungie Aerospace thing that they've been teasing for a while.

41:42.977 --> 41:52.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Among that stuff, and actually I think it's available now, if you have an iOS device, you can download an actual application.

41:52.519 --> 41:53.040
[SPEAKER_02]: That's free.

41:55.260 --> 41:55.981
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

41:56.121 --> 41:59.004
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically kind of ties in with the Bungie website.

41:59.425 --> 42:08.634
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Bungie Mobile, and you can check out your stats for reach and all sorts of stuff.

42:08.694 --> 42:12.438
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sign up for giveaways and... Downloading.

42:13.018 --> 42:14.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo, Combat Evolved HD

42:39.679 --> 42:45.304
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, they're going to have six custom-made Duke controllers.

42:46.205 --> 42:54.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, remember, the Duke controller is the original Xbox controller, the one that was the size of a small, you know, single-family home.

42:54.954 --> 42:56.616
[SPEAKER_09]: The size of Duke Nukem's ego.

42:56.636 --> 42:56.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

42:58.617 --> 43:03.439
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to have those made in a very limited run and they're going to be auctioned off as well.

43:03.839 --> 43:14.842
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess Halo Fest will run alongside PAX Prime from Friday, August 26th to Sunday, August 28th at the Washington State Convention Center.

43:15.823 --> 43:19.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, admission is free if you have your PAX badge.

43:20.823 --> 43:25.467
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you hated those old Xbox controllers, didn't you?

43:25.487 --> 43:26.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my hands are smaller.

43:26.709 --> 43:27.289
[SPEAKER_09]: It really did.

43:27.349 --> 43:29.331
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just painful after a while, but I mean...

43:43.864 --> 43:48.646
[SPEAKER_05]: I can handle a big controller as long as the ergonomics are reasonable.

43:49.126 --> 43:54.827
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturn Dual Analog Controller, I've told everybody that's my favorite controller ever, but it's kind of bulky.

43:55.688 --> 44:00.249
[SPEAKER_05]: But it fits reasonably in the hand, and that's the problem, is that my thumbs just won't reach.

44:03.679 --> 44:06.860
[SPEAKER_09]: I never actually touched one of the original Xbox controller.

44:06.900 --> 44:10.380
[SPEAKER_09]: By the time I bought an Xbox, I bought... I could fix that.

44:10.540 --> 44:14.561
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I've mentioned this on the show before, but when I bought an Xbox, I actually bought a Halo Xbox.

44:14.961 --> 44:17.642
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a green, translucent kind of Xbox.

44:17.722 --> 44:19.362
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very different from the other ones that are out there.

44:19.822 --> 44:20.722
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same one we have.

44:20.982 --> 44:21.242
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah?

44:21.822 --> 44:26.063
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they were limited edition or something, but it came with Halo.

44:26.743 --> 44:28.844
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, when I first played Halo, I loved it.

44:28.864 --> 44:31.324
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I played it at a wedding.

44:32.898 --> 44:37.260
[SPEAKER_09]: My friends got married and it was a Halo, it's kind of a very subtle Halo theme to the wedding.

44:37.740 --> 44:40.001
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, they were just those kinds of people.

44:40.061 --> 44:42.242
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, okay, we're married, let's play Halo.

44:42.282 --> 44:46.863
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody brought TVs and it was like a local area thing because obviously Xbox Live wasn't on the first one.

44:47.203 --> 44:47.784
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

44:47.964 --> 44:50.585
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know that that's exactly what my husband's bachelor party was?

44:51.005 --> 44:51.265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

44:51.945 --> 44:59.188
[SPEAKER_05]: Was cases of beer, about eight TVs set up all over my house, and lots of Halo land.

45:00.908 --> 45:03.249
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, you remember my party.

45:03.769 --> 45:05.229
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's watch XANA do and go drink.

45:05.249 --> 45:05.810
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, I do.

45:05.830 --> 45:06.890
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

45:06.930 --> 45:09.211
[SPEAKER_09]: Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelongerator.com.

45:09.231 --> 45:11.852
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says, The Duke should be stricken from memory.

45:11.912 --> 45:13.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Controller S was vastly superior.

45:14.373 --> 45:18.494
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, The Dreamcast controller was bulky, but it was one of my favorite controllers.

45:18.594 --> 45:20.094
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like the Dreamcast controller, too.

45:20.635 --> 45:23.916
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the whole idea of the VMUs.

45:24.636 --> 45:26.837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a bummer that didn't really stick.

45:26.877 --> 45:27.397
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess...

45:27.677 --> 45:28.258
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

45:43.596 --> 45:46.097
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's talk about free stuff.

45:46.197 --> 45:47.978
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, free games, legal.

45:48.198 --> 45:50.319
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole thing's illegal free games.

45:50.559 --> 45:54.881
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're looking for something new to play, you need to look no further past Steam.

45:55.661 --> 45:59.983
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam has added five free-to-play games available on Steam.

46:00.263 --> 46:02.204
[SPEAKER_09]: You can download them just like anything else.

46:02.624 --> 46:05.205
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all free-to-play MMOs.

46:05.305 --> 46:06.666
[SPEAKER_09]: The games are Spiral Knights.

46:07.386 --> 46:08.546
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say free-to-play games.

46:08.566 --> 46:09.607
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not all necessarily MMOs.

46:09.927 --> 46:17.190
[SPEAKER_09]: Spiral Knights, Forsaken Worlds, Champions Online Free For All, Global Agenda Free Agent, and Alliance of Valiant Arms.

46:17.230 --> 46:20.231
[SPEAKER_09]: They are all on Steam right now, available for you to download.

46:20.872 --> 46:22.272
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some people have been checking them out.

46:22.492 --> 46:25.434
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen our webmaster, Deekman, has been playing Spiral Knights.

46:25.494 --> 46:26.834
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some of his pictures.

46:27.254 --> 46:30.436
[SPEAKER_09]: And they got to the point where it was like, hey, you want to keep playing the good stuff?

46:30.896 --> 46:32.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you got to give us money.

46:32.637 --> 46:35.538
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the only bummer with the free-to-play games is that

46:36.358 --> 46:39.720
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them really just feel like extended demos.

46:41.201 --> 46:44.322
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially, like, what was that one on PlayStation 3 that was so stupid?

46:44.642 --> 46:45.183
[SPEAKER_09]: Free Realms.

46:45.643 --> 46:46.863
[SPEAKER_09]: The one where you can play as a fairy.

46:48.624 --> 46:50.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is blocked off unless you pay for it.

46:50.525 --> 46:51.606
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I haven't downloaded anything.

46:51.666 --> 46:52.486
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just demos.

46:53.247 --> 46:55.748
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I don't know, some people get more out of this.

46:55.808 --> 47:00.330
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear some of these other ones have a little more robust experience, like Champions Online and Global Agenda.

47:00.350 --> 47:03.472
[SPEAKER_09]: A little more of the robust experience, but I haven't played them myself.

47:03.939 --> 47:07.723
[SPEAKER_09]: but if you are looking for something new to try maybe these things will be up your alley check it out

47:28.010 --> 47:29.190
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually feels super natural.

47:29.330 --> 47:30.791
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not super natural, but you know what I mean?

47:30.871 --> 47:32.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Really easy to do.

47:33.291 --> 47:41.253
[SPEAKER_09]: The D-pad's a little weird, kind of like it is on Xbox, but I really like this 360... What the hell's the name of these?

47:41.293 --> 47:41.813
[SPEAKER_09]: The analog?

47:42.053 --> 47:44.154
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion, it's the best controller ever made.

47:46.414 --> 47:46.814
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

47:47.835 --> 47:49.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Loki wants to touch it.

47:49.594 --> 47:53.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, while Loki's touching my controller, I'll go ahead and read the next story.

47:53.415 --> 47:53.975
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that sound?

47:55.036 --> 47:55.336
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

47:56.296 --> 47:58.657
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga likes to sue people.

47:59.357 --> 48:03.738
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now they have another company they're going after called Vostu.

48:04.478 --> 48:08.479
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Brazilian company and they are getting in on Cityville.

48:08.499 --> 48:10.200
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Vostu's Mega City.

48:11.101 --> 48:22.333
[SPEAKER_05]: and if you look at the screen captures it's fairly identical although I have to say that some of Vostu's in-game sprites actually look a lot nicer but they are

48:25.660 --> 48:27.241
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48:45.631 --> 49:04.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Vostu has brazenly appropriated the copyright protected aspects of Zynga's games as well as almost every other aspect of Zynga's business with scant effort to mask their strategy and then offered games virtually identical to Zynga's games to prospective players in the United States and elsewhere.

49:05.562 --> 49:12.809
[SPEAKER_05]: and they did side-by-side video with cleaning a pet.

49:13.309 --> 49:14.290
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole video is here.

49:17.193 --> 49:20.316
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also copied mistakes.

49:20.636 --> 49:22.618
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like they're actually copying code.

49:23.999 --> 49:24.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that were...

49:26.261 --> 49:26.682
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

49:47.041 --> 49:50.023
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like there's quite a bit going on.

49:50.304 --> 49:53.926
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole lawsuit actually is online.

49:58.489 --> 50:02.772
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like they're trying to get them to shut down operations.

50:03.213 --> 50:11.719
[SPEAKER_05]: If you also look at the... They had to raise $45.9 million in funds, Vostu did, to get their thing going.

50:13.220 --> 50:13.420
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

50:13.940 --> 50:18.344
[SPEAKER_09]: I find this stuff kind of ironic because didn't Zynga kind of get their start copying other people's games?

50:18.384 --> 50:21.306
[SPEAKER_09]: Like isn't Farmville taken from Farmtown or something?

50:21.426 --> 50:22.807
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the other thing.

50:23.227 --> 50:32.374
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the company's stats too is that Vostu was founded February 1st, 2007.

50:32.455 --> 50:34.896
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga was founded July 2007 with more money behind them.

50:39.840 --> 50:40.301
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

50:40.581 --> 50:45.164
[SPEAKER_05]: And Vostu is located in New York, whereas Zynga is located in San Francisco.

50:45.904 --> 50:46.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

50:46.905 --> 50:48.406
[SPEAKER_05]: So, fairly interesting.

50:48.506 --> 50:50.047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an East Coast, West Coast thing.

50:50.067 --> 50:50.667
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

50:53.209 --> 50:56.491
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna go down, and it's all gonna go down in Cityville.

50:57.292 --> 50:59.973
[SPEAKER_09]: There's gonna be drive-by shootings and things.

51:00.013 --> 51:01.234
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just gonna have to prove it.

51:01.454 --> 51:03.856
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically gonna come down to which code is older.

51:05.557 --> 51:05.817
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

51:05.837 --> 51:07.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

51:07.893 --> 51:17.029
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, looking at these photos, and I'll show the chat room too, it's pretty identical.

51:17.069 --> 51:20.996
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, Zynga feels pretty confident in this or they wouldn't be suing, so, you know.

51:22.566 --> 51:23.286
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:47.733 --> 51:56.818
[SPEAKER_05]: This girl basically was just pointing out stuff in the Forever 21 catalog that was ugly and blogging about it.

51:57.298 --> 52:07.943
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're saying that she's copying their stuff when Forever 21 is a big copier of actual designers like Anna Sui and big name designers.

52:09.204 --> 52:09.925
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:35.859 --> 52:37.400
[SPEAKER_05]: It all comes down to the source code.

52:38.060 --> 52:39.281
[SPEAKER_05]: It all comes down to the source code.

52:39.761 --> 52:40.221
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

52:41.282 --> 52:41.622
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

52:41.662 --> 52:47.565
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we're going to move on and cover some release dates and check out what is coming out to a gaming store near you very soon.

52:47.605 --> 52:49.686
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start off in the U.S.

52:50.306 --> 52:51.147
[SPEAKER_09]: In the U.S.

52:51.267 --> 52:52.187
[SPEAKER_02]: state of Japan.

52:52.507 --> 52:55.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost said Japan because I was bringing up my Japanese dates, but we're not starting there.

52:55.909 --> 52:58.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, some decent stuff this week.

52:59.411 --> 53:00.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot, though.

53:00.691 --> 53:01.572
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's still...

53:02.694 --> 53:04.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's still a slow time of the year.

53:06.436 --> 53:08.757
[SPEAKER_02]: From EA, though, and this is kind of cool.

53:08.817 --> 53:20.203
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a collaboration between, I want to say, Suda51 and the guy that created Resident Evil.

53:20.563 --> 53:24.425
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, it's Shadows of the Damned, kind of a Grindhouse-ish...

53:27.293 --> 53:30.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of call it a grindhouse-ish Dante's Inferno game.

53:31.056 --> 53:31.816
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty awesome.

53:32.257 --> 53:36.360
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

53:37.681 --> 53:41.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I believe that they are re-releasing...

53:42.965 --> 53:43.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Black Ops

54:09.726 --> 54:17.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, or I believe actually, no, later this week, Wii Play Motion will be coming out from Nintendo.

54:18.172 --> 54:24.618
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, of course, is not a minigame collection, of course, because why would they throw tech demos into a game?

54:25.478 --> 54:27.620
[SPEAKER_02]: That will also be coming with the Wii Remote Plus.

54:28.261 --> 54:30.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Cars 2, the video game, tied in with the upcoming movie.

54:30.743 --> 54:33.465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on all major formats, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

54:33.565 --> 54:33.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Also...

54:40.592 --> 55:08.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Gods and Heroes Rome Rising that's coming out on PC there's some PSP 2 packs that are coming out kind of some cheap games Kills and Liberation, Siphon Filters Logan Challenger that's on PSP for $14.99 not bad and then also they have a couple other collections this week as well I'm trying to remember what they were

55:09.878 --> 55:10.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

55:11.099 --> 55:11.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll get back to that.

55:12.160 --> 55:13.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Fear 3 also this week.

55:22.225 --> 55:31.952
[SPEAKER_02]: Arma 2 Reinforcements on PC, Dual Pen Sports on the 3DS, which I'm not sure how that works considering that the 3DS is not multi-touch.

55:32.832 --> 55:36.555
[SPEAKER_02]: Pets Fantasy for the 3DS.

55:37.295 --> 55:40.978

56:26.118 --> 56:44.080
[SPEAKER_09]: so that is coming out finally this week that is the big release on Xbox 360 coming out on PlayStation 3 this week on the 23rd some more choices for you Mass Effect 2 the Japanese release is out this week as well as of course the Grand Theft Auto 4 collection Bleach Soul Ignition out from Sony this week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan

[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if this is a game that is out here.

56:56.246 --> 56:56.606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

56:56.966 --> 56:57.187
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it?

56:57.287 --> 56:57.787
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have one of these at home.

57:05.251 --> 57:06.831
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't played yet, like the last one in the series.

57:07.992 --> 57:09.753
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's on the PlayStation 3 this week.

57:10.633 --> 57:12.713

[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to The Last Guardian?

57:44.701 --> 57:46.883
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought they were going to announce that at E3 this year for the Wii.

57:46.903 --> 57:49.826
[SPEAKER_09]: That's supposed to be a kick-ass game on the Wii.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.227
[SPEAKER_09]: For The Last Guardian?

57:51.627 --> 57:52.388
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not The Last Guardian.

[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, no.

57:53.409 --> 57:54.770
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking that's the PlayStation 3.

57:54.990 --> 57:55.691
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I thinking of?

57:56.271 --> 57:58.113
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some big role-playing game from Mistwalker.

57:58.133 --> 57:58.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Last Story.

57:58.833 --> 57:59.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Last Story.

58:00.094 --> 58:00.995
[SPEAKER_09]: One word difference.

58:02.697 --> 58:04.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different games, though.

58:04.158 --> 58:04.778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sorry.

58:04.839 --> 58:05.299
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

58:05.759 --> 58:06.020
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

58:06.380 --> 58:08.141
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo 3DS in Japan this week.

58:08.382 --> 58:09.042
[SPEAKER_09]: Fish Eyes 3D.

58:11.365 --> 58:11.946
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

58:30.506 --> 58:32.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, who would want to rope in dead fish?

58:33.187 --> 58:38.509
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you rope them in while they're alive and kicking, and then they die when they're sitting in a styrofoam container.

58:38.829 --> 58:41.490
[SPEAKER_09]: No, all the radiation in the water killed them.

58:42.291 --> 58:42.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Kidding?

58:42.691 --> 58:43.131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

58:43.151 --> 58:43.791
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, gosh.

58:43.831 --> 58:44.632
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on.

58:44.652 --> 58:45.672
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very insensitive of you.

58:45.692 --> 58:48.253
[SPEAKER_09]: I am completely insensitive, but all right, let's move on.

58:50.234 --> 59:12.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Dream Trigger 3D for 3DS Fear 3 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360 Get Fit with Mel B, Who Cares Gods and Heroes, Rome Rising Let's Dance with Mel B, Who Else Cares Shadows of the Damned Call of Duty Black Ops Annihilation Pack Sorry, that was the 28th, my bad.

59:13.349 --> 59:13.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

59:15.511 --> 59:16.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, it's a quick week.

59:17.745 --> 59:18.846
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:35.720 --> 59:36.240
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

59:51.105 --> 01:00:17.751
[SPEAKER_02]: and good luck for both of them because both lawsuits in either direction were approved so the lawsuit filed against Activision by Infinity Ward is moving forward and I guess that the claims have merit also apparently the judge has allowed the countersuit to move forward as well so it'll be interesting to see how that pans out

01:00:18.812 --> 01:00:26.817
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, since we're talking about Activision here, and everybody loves Bobby Kotick, Bobby Kotick actually has... They do?

01:00:27.898 --> 01:00:28.799
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm being sarcastic.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarcasm, it's fun.

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:45.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Kotick actually has a cameo as, I guess, a manager of a baseball team in Moneyball, the new Brad Pitt movie about the Oakland A's.

01:00:48.598 --> 01:00:50.459
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, they made a movie about the Oakland A's?

01:00:50.699 --> 01:00:52.540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah Why?

01:00:53.620 --> 01:01:02.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there was this coach that came in and changed the way they do drafting or whatever and it was a big deal Why don't they make a movie about a good baseball team?

01:01:02.685 --> 01:01:04.406
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they make a movie about the Giants?

01:01:06.607 --> 01:01:17.232
[SPEAKER_09]: Field of Dreams A League of Their Own I'd be more interested in seeing A League of Their Own again and watching a movie about the Oakland A's

01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:22.863
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, one more story for you guys.

01:01:22.963 --> 01:01:25.745
[SPEAKER_09]: And this has been all over the press this week.

01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:26.806
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you guys have heard.

01:01:27.207 --> 01:01:29.909
[SPEAKER_09]: But some of your favorite gaming websites were hacked.

01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.690
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.012
[SPEAKER_09]: Bethesda was hacked earlier this week.

01:01:33.212 --> 01:01:40.078
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, Bethesda apparently had 200,000 user accounts compromised there.

01:01:40.198 --> 01:01:43.901
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, be careful if you were a member of Bethesda's forums.

01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:50.207
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the same hackers took down Minecraft, EVE Online, and The Escapist Magazine.

01:01:50.227 --> 01:01:55.091
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of this was from denial-of-service attacks, a very popular way to bring down websites out there.

01:01:55.992 --> 01:02:00.676
[SPEAKER_09]: EVE Online was taken offline for several hours, as was The Escapist Magazine Online.

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:03.819
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Minecraft was down for a little bit, but they came back up pretty quick.

01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:10.981
[SPEAKER_09]: Good rule of thumb here, the same hacker group released I think like 62,000 login and passwords.

01:02:12.761 --> 01:02:22.103
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't use the same password on Bethesda's website or Square Enix's forums or whatever gaming forums you log into.

01:02:22.503 --> 01:02:25.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't use the same password there that you use on PayPal.

01:02:26.324 --> 01:02:30.927
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a real chance for you to evaluate the passwords that you use.

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:35.989
[SPEAKER_09]: And we kind of throw this out there as a warning to those out there that don't want to end up in the same boat.

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:43.393
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know what we say on the show, I'm not condoning what these guys are doing, but you know the old saying, hackers are going to hack.

01:02:43.953 --> 01:02:49.456
[SPEAKER_09]: And for whatever the reason, whether it be they're trying to make a point or trying to steal money or whatever it is.

01:02:49.816 --> 01:02:52.778
[SPEAKER_09]: So just make sure you don't use the same password.

01:02:53.718 --> 01:02:58.240
[SPEAKER_09]: for your banking that you do on the Orange Challenge Radio forums even.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:06.943
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll tell you what, PHPBB is what we use and what a lot of different websites use.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.484
[SPEAKER_09]: Those things I'm sure can get hacked pretty easy.

01:03:09.824 --> 01:03:14.766
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't use the same password on anything like that that you would use for your bank or your PayPal.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:15.927
[SPEAKER_09]: Have different passwords.

01:03:17.387 --> 01:03:19.008
[SPEAKER_09]: This public service announcement brought to you by us.

01:03:20.154 --> 01:03:20.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:03:20.754 --> 01:03:21.635
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:24.656
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some classic gaming.

01:03:24.696 --> 01:03:26.357
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a stroll down memory lane.

01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:34.400
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura has picked a classic game, or games as the case may be tonight, that she's going to highlight as the classic game of the week.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one and only true love for this week in gaming.

01:03:40.362 --> 01:03:42.803
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what should the kids out there be playing this week?

01:03:43.203 --> 01:03:43.764
[SPEAKER_05]: Contra.

01:03:44.504 --> 01:03:46.024
[SPEAKER_05]: I selected the Contra series.

01:03:46.044 --> 01:03:49.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, because I think you did the Contra game a while ago, but now we've got the whole damn series.

01:03:50.496 --> 01:03:52.900
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember doing Contra, but okay.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.126
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, basically, the series started in 1987.

01:03:58.307 --> 01:04:07.258
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a run-and-gun style shooter, and it came out as Contra, and then we had the release Super Contra in 1988, and a bunch of other Contras.

01:04:08.199 --> 01:04:23.308
[SPEAKER_05]: and now this is actually just my old Japanese studies that makes me pretty giddy is that it was in Japanese it was written out in Ateji which is like using the kanji but for their pronunciation

01:04:24.669 --> 01:04:26.870
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was pretty interesting.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:35.854
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually, the first one came out after, the arcade one, came out after the Iran-Contra affair.

01:04:36.354 --> 01:04:38.755
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were like, well, is this about that?

01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:41.216
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was an ending theme.

01:04:41.596 --> 01:04:42.796
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called Sandinista.

01:04:42.816 --> 01:04:44.317
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone remembers that.

01:04:44.877 --> 01:05:00.727
[SPEAKER_05]: The original is side-scrolling, but you've got a few 3D view areas, is what they were called, where it's behind you.

01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:04.890
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a couple of overhead ones, like in Super Contra and Contra 3 The Alien Wars.

01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:06.151
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

01:05:07.848 --> 01:05:09.110
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:34.124
[SPEAKER_05]: and then basically they were all two player except for the MSX2 version of Contra and Operation C for the Game Boy.

01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:35.305
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were only single player.

01:05:36.726 --> 01:05:49.234
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get different weapons and you can replace your regular gun with a laser gun or a spread gun, rapid bullets, they increase your fire speed.

01:05:49.274 --> 01:05:54.177
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also get the Mega Shell in Super Contra or Bombs in Contra 3 and Contra Hardcorp.

01:05:55.657 --> 01:05:56.958
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's all kinds of neat stuff.

01:05:57.058 --> 01:06:00.699
[SPEAKER_05]: But the biggest thing about Contra is that it was hard.

01:06:01.619 --> 01:06:04.981
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the record, the NES version of Contra does use the Konami code.

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:06.761
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives you 30 lives instead of 3.

01:06:07.822 --> 01:06:11.543
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the most infamous game to use the Konami code because you couldn't really beat it without it.

01:06:14.572 --> 01:06:23.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the other ones had the extra lives codes in the Japanese releases, such as Contra Spirits, which was Contra 3 over here, and Contra Hardcore.

01:06:24.136 --> 01:06:25.176
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the games in the series.

01:06:25.216 --> 01:06:30.958
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Contra, which is on Arcade, NES, MSX2, DOS, C64, CPC, ZX.

01:06:31.939 --> 01:06:35.360
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Super Contra, Arcade, NES, DOS, and Amiga.

01:06:36.561 --> 01:06:37.801
[SPEAKER_05]: Operation Sea on Game Boy.

01:06:37.881 --> 01:06:41.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Contra 3 The Alien Wars, which was SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance.

01:06:42.383 --> 01:06:53.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Contra Force on the NES, Contra Hardcore which was on Genesis slash Mega Drive, Contra Legacy of War on PlayStation and Saturn which I think we have the Saturn one of that I want to say.

01:06:54.506 --> 01:07:01.108
[SPEAKER_05]: See the Contra Adventure on PlayStation, Contra Shattered Soldier on PS2, Neo Contra on PS2, Contra 4 on Nintendo DS.

01:07:02.128 --> 01:07:03.949
[SPEAKER_05]: That was done by WayForward Technology.

01:07:04.869 --> 01:07:13.895
[SPEAKER_05]: and it actually had two screens that, you know, because it was a DS you had different kinds of views that you could use.

01:07:13.955 --> 01:07:27.804
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Contra Rebirth that was done by M2 for WiiWare and Hardcore Uprising which is on PS3, Xbox 360 and that's a downloadable title released this year.

01:07:28.024 --> 01:07:32.087
[SPEAKER_05]: There were re-releases of Contra and Super Contra and

01:07:33.584 --> 01:07:34.767
[SPEAKER_05]: There were DOS ports.

01:07:34.787 --> 01:07:37.573
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the outstretched CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum.

01:07:38.494 --> 01:07:40.398
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Europe, it came out as Gryzor.

01:07:42.711 --> 01:07:42.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:49.035
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually mobile phone versions to Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade.

01:07:49.955 --> 01:07:57.219
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as cancelled games, there was Contra Spirit 64, which was in development by Konami of Osaka.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.362
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it was cancelled when the development team disbanded.

01:08:03.363 --> 01:08:04.763
[SPEAKER_05]: That was being worked on in 1998.

01:08:04.823 --> 01:08:05.264
[SPEAKER_05]: For other ones...

01:08:08.105 --> 01:08:11.387
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this game, Konami YY World, which is on Famicom.

01:08:12.507 --> 01:08:20.391
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually had the same boss theme that was used in the original Contra and it came out right before Contra.

01:08:21.491 --> 01:08:27.934
[SPEAKER_05]: YY World 2, SOS, Parsley Joe, Bill Riser is a playable character in there, Snatcher.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:39.318
[SPEAKER_05]: The two characters, Bill and Lance, go to a Konami-themed party held at the Outer Heaven show pub.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:48.147
[SPEAKER_05]: They are replaced by Light and Pastel from Twinbee, but in the 32-bit version of the game, there's a Contra ad in there.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:51.310
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a nanobraker, Jaguar from Neo Contra, as a hidden character.

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:56.352
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Student Council, which is a TV anime produced by Konami.

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:01.435
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a character called Lance Bean, who is not a Contra character.

01:09:04.216 --> 01:09:05.737
[SPEAKER_05]: Palopuro-kun Pocket 8 is...

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:11.353
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:09:35.610 --> 01:10:03.353
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah these were all set in the 27th century the initial Contra and the sequels had Bill Reiser and Lance Bean who were modeled after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and then they were named after actors that were in Aliens as in Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser so and then Lance Henriksen and Michael Bean for Lance Bean so I thought that was neat

01:10:04.494 --> 01:10:19.811
[SPEAKER_05]: and then after that it sort of deviated and had different people and then Contra Shattered Soldier brought back Bill Reiser who was a war criminal and then Neo Contra also had him in there too but it was a clone oh well spoilers

01:10:21.952 --> 01:10:36.159
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as differences in the different versions, there were some changes in between the Japanese and US ones, mostly in character naming and who the character is supposed to be.

01:10:39.332 --> 01:10:52.601
[SPEAKER_05]: There were also different bad guys, like the Red Falcon was actually the Tenoki Gaba, was what his name was, the Emperor Demon Gaba.

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:58.425
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was Mad Dog and Scorpion were given to Bill and Lance in the NES versions.

01:11:00.727 --> 01:11:26.047
[SPEAKER_05]: when it came out in Europe and Australia it was called Probotector and they were robots so they weren't Bill and Lance and then different versions came out as I said earlier as Grisor and then Super Protector, Alien Rebels which is Contra 3, The Alien Wars for Game Boy they were also put out as Probotector

01:11:27.308 --> 01:11:35.099
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the Wii versions were released as Probotector in the UK.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:43.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Contra 4 did not get released in Europe, but Probotector was in the game as a hidden character.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:44.471
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it.

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:47.262
[SPEAKER_09]: Good lord, that's a lot of Contra.

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:48.303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:11:48.823 --> 01:11:49.643
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a great series.

01:11:49.784 --> 01:11:50.324
[SPEAKER_09]: Hard as hell.

01:11:50.844 --> 01:11:51.525
[SPEAKER_09]: No, serious.

01:11:51.565 --> 01:11:53.826
[SPEAKER_09]: But very rewarding if you can actually make your way through the games.

01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:55.227
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

01:11:55.748 --> 01:11:55.968
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:11:56.188 --> 01:12:02.532
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid-fire news.

01:12:02.592 --> 01:12:08.336
[SPEAKER_09]: Your Twitter topics, so get those in twitter.com slash OLR if you have something you want us to talk about or any questions for us tonight.

01:12:08.356 --> 01:12:10.978
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about Kinect making its way to the PC.

01:12:10.998 --> 01:12:14.680
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk a little more about that Silent Hill collection that was announced at E3.

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.921
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more details coming out on that.

01:12:16.382 --> 01:12:19.006
[SPEAKER_09]: and Nintendo Stance on free-to-play games.

01:12:19.506 --> 01:12:24.274
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk a little more about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:30.023 --> 01:12:32.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:32.524 --> 01:12:38.145
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live with episode number 416 of our show on this June 19th, 2011.

01:12:38.485 --> 01:12:39.926
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what next week is.

01:12:40.306 --> 01:12:45.607
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be June 26th, 2011, and that's the closest show to our ninth birthday as a station.

01:12:46.508 --> 01:12:49.028
[SPEAKER_09]: June 23rd, or I should say as a show.

01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:52.449
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to have a station on Life is Five, but then, of course, we folded that a few years ago.

01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:54.490
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence our new home at All Games, which we like.

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:58.273
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that is all going to be next week.

01:12:58.613 --> 01:13:00.095
[SPEAKER_09]: Not doing anything special, guys.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:06.920
[SPEAKER_09]: Nine's like a weird number, and we thought maybe it would be better to save something really cool for 10 years.

01:13:07.001 --> 01:13:09.082
[SPEAKER_05]: We should open up with Rumstein.

01:13:09.242 --> 01:13:15.408
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping we can get a guest or something to come in and have fun with us, but we're not really planning on anything super huge.

01:13:15.548 --> 01:13:19.411
[SPEAKER_09]: There just comes a point where celebrating too much is just too much.

01:13:19.511 --> 01:13:21.233
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, okay, we had a five-year show.

01:13:21.553 --> 01:13:24.455
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a 300, a 400, you know, nine years, whatever.

01:13:24.655 --> 01:13:25.476
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's that.

01:13:26.776 --> 01:13:28.918
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be here next week, of course, with that.

01:13:29.098 --> 01:13:38.103
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to wish us happy birthday, a great way to do that, of course, would be to rate us on iTunes with a five-star review because that helps other people notice the show or just spread the word.

01:13:38.143 --> 01:13:40.225
[SPEAKER_09]: We always say at the end of the show, spread the word about the show.

01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:41.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Send a tweet.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:46.108
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw somebody made a very nice Facebook post this week pointing us to the Orange Launch Radio Facebook.

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:47.049
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was great.

01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:49.310
[SPEAKER_09]: So all that stuff always really helps.

01:13:49.331 --> 01:13:49.851
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes a long way.

01:13:50.505 --> 01:13:55.807
[SPEAKER_09]: During the break, Loki was asking me about why didn't I mention Child of Eden during my gaming week?

01:13:55.887 --> 01:14:08.252
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've made it no secret on the show before, I'm a huge fan of Q and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, obviously the Reds, Space Channel, Luminous, shit, I even loved Every Extent Extra Extreme.

01:14:08.852 --> 01:14:13.654
[SPEAKER_09]: I still say 99 Nights wasn't as bad as y'all made it out to be, but maybe that's a little bit of fanboyism there.

01:14:13.894 --> 01:14:37.143
[SPEAKER_09]: but I did not play Child of Eden this week long story short I was basically reminded that I had a birthday coming up and maybe I shouldn't make any game purchases until my birthday has passed for those that don't know my birthday happens to also be next Sunday my birthday was three days after the original OLR on June 23rd so yeah my birthday is right around this time too so I have to wait until then and then you know maybe there'll be a gift card or something I can use to go get it

01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:38.704
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it will bring you to tears.

01:15:01.593 --> 01:15:02.594
[SPEAKER_09]: It will bring you to tears.

01:15:02.814 --> 01:15:05.476
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the original Rez was an amazing game, too.

01:15:05.716 --> 01:15:07.357
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was probably only about 90 minutes.

01:15:07.858 --> 01:15:10.139
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, granted, games didn't cost 60 bucks back then.

01:15:10.199 --> 01:15:16.244
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that brings me to tears is the fact that I forgot to send in Josh's picture when they were doing picture submissions.

01:15:16.264 --> 01:15:18.425
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that would have been awesome.

01:15:18.485 --> 01:15:19.266
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot that was there.

01:15:20.006 --> 01:15:24.790
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been trying to stay spoiler-free, so please don't spoil or whatever.

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:25.010
[SPEAKER_09]: But

01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:28.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki and I were kind of talking a little bit about the whole 90 minutes thing.

01:15:28.712 --> 01:15:41.441
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki, you feel that 90 minutes, paying $60 for a 90-minute experience is okay, which is funny to hear from you because usually you're the first one to dog people that are wanting to kind of price gouge and all that stuff.

01:15:41.481 --> 01:15:45.684
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's a damn good 90 minutes, then it might be worth the cost, right?

01:15:45.904 --> 01:15:46.404
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:15:46.464 --> 01:15:49.426
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way I look at it is like shooters.

01:15:49.486 --> 01:15:53.569
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shooters that are out there, I'm not talking about first-person shooters.

01:15:53.589 --> 01:15:55.070
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about arcade games.

01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:57.434
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not 30 hours long.

01:15:57.575 --> 01:16:00.440
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like a few hours, if that.

01:16:01.142 --> 01:16:03.967
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a full fleshed out game.

01:16:03.987 --> 01:16:04.248
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

01:16:05.717 --> 01:16:08.239
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a whole lot of story with this stuff.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.762
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to spend extra time for story development and whatnot.

01:16:13.822 --> 01:16:21.147
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's a good, entertaining 90 minutes, it's better than a boring 6 hours or a boring 30 hours.

01:16:22.308 --> 01:16:24.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you might spend $60 to go to an awesome concert.

01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:29.652
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably spent over $100 to go see Lady Gaga.

01:16:30.713 --> 01:16:32.094
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was a pretty awesome 90 minutes.

01:16:32.134 --> 01:16:32.314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:16:33.935 --> 01:16:39.056
[SPEAKER_09]: But all joking aside, obviously reviewers are going to react differently and so forth.

01:16:39.076 --> 01:16:40.577
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, that's the thing.

01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:42.537
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my problem with some of these reviewers nowadays.

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:48.539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they kind of forgot how games were or they forgot how things are.

01:16:49.259 --> 01:16:52.080
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, this isn't as good as Call of Duty, so I don't like it.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.901
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand that.

01:16:53.961 --> 01:16:58.302
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me play devil's advocate a little bit here, though, is that the game marketplace isn't what it used to be.

01:16:58.662 --> 01:17:02.703
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be fair, there's a lot of games out there that have intense replayability value.

01:17:03.163 --> 01:17:03.583
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:17:20.237 --> 01:17:21.638
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a first-person shooter.

01:17:21.658 --> 01:17:22.399
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.

01:17:22.519 --> 01:17:24.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.702
[SPEAKER_02]: You can judge first-person shooters against other first-person shooters.

01:17:28.223 --> 01:17:30.584
[SPEAKER_02]: And granted, you can judge different elements of it.

01:17:30.624 --> 01:17:34.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, this has good production value and stuff like that.

01:17:35.728 --> 01:17:48.336
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't say, oh, because this shooter slash music game is not as long as Final Fantasy XIII, well, I'm going to have to rate it lower or something.

01:17:48.356 --> 01:17:49.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:17:49.417 --> 01:17:50.178
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

01:18:09.298 --> 01:18:14.841
[SPEAKER_02]: and find the reviewers that are sharing your same dislikes or likes with these games.

01:18:14.881 --> 01:18:20.183
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you find a reviewer that kind of thinks like you do, then you'll know whether to trust that person's opinion or not.

01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:24.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day, an IGN review, that's one person's opinion.

01:18:24.145 --> 01:18:29.367
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one person's opinion that you're holding so much weight against because it's IGN.com.

01:18:29.647 --> 01:18:30.347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one dude.

01:18:30.528 --> 01:18:33.369
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hell, if I said I hate this game, I hate Madden.

01:18:33.969 --> 01:18:34.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:52.602
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

01:19:14.012 --> 01:19:38.076
[SPEAKER_02]: and so a lot of times it seems like that that comes out it's not a unbiased opinion and sometimes I think that they just dog on a game so badly because it's funny and people will you know link to that article to get some pages just because you know such as the websites that gave Duke Nukem Forever a zero like you know I again I haven't played Duke Nukem Forever but a zero like I

01:19:38.556 --> 01:19:52.144
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I can trust a website that gave Fusion Frenzy 2 a higher score than Duke Nukem Forever.

01:19:52.444 --> 01:19:56.587
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst game I've played this generation.

01:19:56.907 --> 01:20:02.610
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, once again, like I said, it's all about whether... Bomberman Zero.

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:03.251
[SPEAKER_09]: I take that back.

01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:05.052
[SPEAKER_09]: Bomberman Zero is the worst game I've played this generation.

01:20:06.394 --> 01:20:09.938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about whether you agree with the person that's reviewing stuff.

01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:13.623
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain video movie reviewers out there that you may have.

01:20:13.983 --> 01:20:20.631
[SPEAKER_02]: You may share the same opinion with Roger Ebert as opposed to some other guy or vice versa.

01:20:21.332 --> 01:20:25.597
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about finding the reviewer that makes sense to you.

01:20:25.997 --> 01:20:54.186
[SPEAKER_02]: or or what you can do is instead of worrying about wasting a lot of money you know what guess what you can go now to Redbox Machines and you can rent a game for two dollars for a night so you know what you can get a taste of the game or you can play a demo or you can rent it at a you know traditional video rental place or you can do it through Gamefly or wherever and you don't spend you know sixty dollars on a game you can check it out and if you like it cool you buy it if not then you didn't waste that much money

01:20:54.431 --> 01:20:58.856
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go to some comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we are taping live on this Sunday night.

01:20:59.176 --> 01:21:03.081
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman in our chatroom says, For 90 minutes of fun, a hooker would charge you a lot more money.

01:21:03.141 --> 01:21:04.422
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is actually a good deal.

01:21:05.123 --> 01:21:06.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Child of Eden.

01:21:06.124 --> 01:21:06.465
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

01:21:06.485 --> 01:21:08.747
[SPEAKER_09]: I did learn that from watching Cat House Girls.

01:21:09.088 --> 01:21:15.175
[SPEAKER_09]: It was that Air Force Amy, or whatever her name was, would charge probably several hundred dollars for 90 minutes of fun.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:26.049
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling that the people in that cat house charge a lot more than your traditional hooker because they're in Vegas and shit.

01:21:26.129 --> 01:21:27.510
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that was the Bunny Ranch.

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:29.492
[SPEAKER_09]: That's up past Reno.

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:30.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my mistake.

01:21:30.713 --> 01:21:31.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's still Nevada.

01:21:31.974 --> 01:21:33.635
[SPEAKER_02]: They figure people gambling have a lot of money.

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:35.677
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we could drive to the Bunny Ranch.

01:21:37.178 --> 01:21:40.101
[SPEAKER_09]: We should take your wife out to the Bunny Ranch someday.

01:21:42.183 --> 01:21:49.231
[SPEAKER_02]: One of her aspirations in life was to get a prostitution license at some point for Nevada.

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.353
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to frame it and put it, you know.

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:51.714
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.

01:21:59.241 --> 01:22:03.225
[SPEAKER_02]: and to read Saddam Hussein's romance novels that he wrote.

01:22:04.727 --> 01:22:07.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two of her aspirations.

01:22:07.549 --> 01:22:09.111
[SPEAKER_09]: I think your wife needs a podcast.

01:22:09.311 --> 01:22:13.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Not about games, but I think your wife just needs a podcast called Nelly's Dreams.

01:22:14.116 --> 01:22:16.178
[SPEAKER_09]: And every week she could talk about a dream of hers.

01:22:17.279 --> 01:22:21.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of the stuff that we talk about ends up on Facebook anyway, especially if we say something funny.

01:22:21.663 --> 01:22:27.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Like last night, I was saying something to her, and to her, a lot of the stuff I say sounds like mumbling.

01:22:27.468 --> 01:22:28.709
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she'll say, you said this?

01:22:29.009 --> 01:22:33.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, it's usually something ridiculous.

01:22:34.634 --> 01:22:35.715
[SPEAKER_02]: You called me an N-word?

01:22:36.115 --> 01:22:37.637
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not what I said at all.

01:22:39.684 --> 01:22:43.388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember what the hell I actually said It was not even close

01:22:54.977 --> 01:22:55.938
[SPEAKER_05]: Comic Insanity.

01:22:56.618 --> 01:23:02.143
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a podcast up every Tuesday on Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

01:23:02.883 --> 01:23:05.265
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk comics and other geeky stuff.

01:23:06.426 --> 01:23:06.947
[SPEAKER_05]: So tune in.

01:23:07.227 --> 01:23:09.789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me and Tiara and Dan Jetto.

01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:40.949
[SPEAKER_09]: and I saw some of you in chat saying that I'm dogging on Warcraft which I don't think I am really but then on the other token I turn around and I play World of Warcraft which isn't for everyone and that's fine I understand that game isn't for everyone but if you think it might be for you or it is for you you should check out the best little horde house in Azeroth hordehouse.com that's the show I do with Extifer about the World of Warcraft it's put out every week except last week because I was doing double duty here for E3 but we did come back with episode 29 this week and it was a lot of fun

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:45.134
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about the upcoming patch that still has not come out.

01:23:45.695 --> 01:23:47.798
[SPEAKER_09]: That may not come out on Tuesday after all.

01:23:48.198 --> 01:23:51.202
[SPEAKER_09]: So lots of WoW stuff and Warcraft discussion going on there.

01:23:51.242 --> 01:23:52.644
[SPEAKER_09]: HordeHouse.com

01:23:53.134 --> 01:23:55.476
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on and get into some rapid fire news.

01:23:55.856 --> 01:23:57.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of new gaming stories throughout the week.

01:23:57.978 --> 01:24:00.019
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't always have time to spend five minutes on all of them.

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:02.761
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk quickly about some of the things you might otherwise miss.

01:24:02.942 --> 01:24:03.202
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

01:24:03.522 --> 01:24:04.903
[SPEAKER_02]: So EA is trying something out.

01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:11.068
[SPEAKER_02]: They decided to open a retail store for EA Sports in the Charlotte Airport.

01:24:11.668 --> 01:24:14.431
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, if you've been to airports, they have a lot of...

01:24:15.111 --> 01:24:15.471
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

01:24:32.382 --> 01:24:41.593
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're going to be doing that, and I guess kind of as a test to see if this is something that would take off other places.

01:24:42.354 --> 01:24:42.954
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:24:43.115 --> 01:24:51.404
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neat idea, but I don't think you're going to see this really anywhere else because, you know, everybody carries EA Sports stuff, so... I don't know.

01:24:51.484 --> 01:24:51.865
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean...

01:24:53.566 --> 01:24:56.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Those theme type stores are pretty popular in airports.

01:24:57.808 --> 01:24:58.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.

01:24:59.768 --> 01:25:00.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is kind of interesting.

01:25:01.269 --> 01:25:03.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Never thought I would see a sequel to this game.

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:06.891
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently Namco is doing a new Namco Generations game.

01:25:07.491 --> 01:25:09.211
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game is Dancing Eyes.

01:25:09.331 --> 01:25:11.412
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dancing Eyes was an arcade game.

01:25:12.052 --> 01:25:13.193
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out I think in the 2000s.

01:25:14.273 --> 01:25:14.914
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:25:30.547 --> 01:25:44.718
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you connected the dots or connected the lines around a shape, that shape would disappear and reveal either the scantily clad woman underneath or, in some cases, a cow or a person or who knows.

01:25:44.778 --> 01:25:45.159
[SPEAKER_02]: Titties?

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.002
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was no nudity in any of these games.

01:25:49.062 --> 01:25:51.844
[SPEAKER_02]: But after you did get done, though, they played the kind of...

01:25:56.010 --> 01:25:56.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Burlesque

01:26:05.504 --> 01:26:09.708
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to be putting out a new game now for the Namco Generations.

01:26:09.888 --> 01:26:11.469
[SPEAKER_09]: You used to play this game in Arcade Infinity.

01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:16.713
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I did play this, and I actually have it on my arcade cabinet at home.

01:26:16.833 --> 01:26:18.655
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played it in MAME, and it's fun.

01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:24.340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, it's not an adult game.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.182
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sort of could... I guess it's... It's PG-13.

01:26:27.202 --> 01:26:27.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean...

01:26:29.964 --> 01:26:36.066
[SPEAKER_02]: You reveal women wearing bikinis or a girl dressed up like a cat.

01:26:36.126 --> 01:26:37.646
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a cat girl or something.

01:26:37.666 --> 01:26:39.387
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, not a cat girl.

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:47.669
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing as a monkey and you run around and you're trying to avoid different enemies that are running around the screen.

01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:49.410
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're supposed to dodge them.

01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:51.631
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have some screenshots here.

01:26:51.991 --> 01:26:58.953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically just running around like a woman's shirt and it's revealing her bra underneath.

01:26:58.973 --> 01:26:59.013
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:01.278
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:04.409
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 96 is when it came out in the arcade.

01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:05.031
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 2000.

01:27:07.543 --> 01:27:07.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat.

01:27:08.364 --> 01:27:18.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're going to be doing a game or a new version of Metro Cross as Arrow Cross, I guess.

01:27:19.713 --> 01:27:21.155
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

01:27:21.755 --> 01:27:33.005
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, I guess this is good news for people that are looking for a new Psychonauts game, but Double Fine is now obtaining the rights to publish a new Psychonauts game.

01:27:34.802 --> 01:27:51.236
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course it came out back in 2005 and Tim Schafer says Double Fine has always owned the intellectual property rights for Psychonauts franchise so we've been free to pursue movies, sequels, etc.

01:27:51.816 --> 01:27:58.922
[SPEAKER_02]: What's changed recently is the publishing rights to the game Psychonauts have reverted to Double Fine and some of the deals still need to be finalized.

01:27:59.063 --> 01:28:00.684
[SPEAKER_02]: This means anything financially.

01:28:01.144 --> 01:28:02.846
[SPEAKER_02]: When that happens we'll have more to announce.

01:28:05.693 --> 01:28:06.013
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:28:06.273 --> 01:28:06.414
[SPEAKER_09]: Neat.

01:28:07.274 --> 01:28:13.677
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, moving on to Xbox Live, you might have caught the indie games uprising last winter.

01:28:14.137 --> 01:28:17.338
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a way for the indie games on Xbox Live to get more exposure.

01:28:17.378 --> 01:28:22.060
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, there was a little bit of back and forth because it was something that the community kind of came up with.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:26.402
[SPEAKER_09]: And Microsoft at first didn't really support it, but they finally came around and they did kind of give it some support.

01:28:27.383 --> 01:28:29.344
[SPEAKER_09]: and so forth calling attention to it.

01:28:50.976 --> 01:28:54.199
[SPEAKER_09]: So this will be a way to get visibility for some of those games.

01:28:54.499 --> 01:28:55.479
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see what happens there.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:04.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Submissions, if you are an indie developer, you know an indie developer that might want to get in on this, you can submit through June 24th.

01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:06.668
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not very much more time.

01:29:06.728 --> 01:29:07.529
[SPEAKER_09]: So you might want to get on that.

01:29:08.729 --> 01:29:15.972
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, speaking of Xbox, one of the big things that was shown at the Microsoft press conference this year was the Fable The Journey demonstration.

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:21.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a very interesting quote from Peter Molyneux this week about it.

01:29:22.235 --> 01:29:26.477
[SPEAKER_09]: This was in an interview with official Xbox magazine, quote,

01:29:27.337 --> 01:29:28.977
[SPEAKER_09]: A horrendous mistake, and...

01:29:52.442 --> 01:30:06.088
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to agree, they made a huge mistake not showing that you could navigate it did look like rails so they should have said something about that but who knows, we'll see more about this when it gets a little closer to release

01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:11.653
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, the reason why they did what they did, they wanted to showcase the game's action.

01:30:12.274 --> 01:30:15.456
[SPEAKER_09]: Like using the magic attacks and the whole horse and carriage and all that stuff.

01:30:16.197 --> 01:30:19.200
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the non-Unrails part wasn't finished yet.

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:25.425
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the other big pieces to come out of E3 was that you're going to get a free game if you have a 3DS.

01:30:25.765 --> 01:30:29.068
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to get the Four Swords, The Legend of Zelda Four Swords.

01:30:29.529 --> 01:30:32.611
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be coming out for free a little later this year.

01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:34.373
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be out in September.

01:30:34.813 --> 01:30:35.893
[SPEAKER_09]: According to Nintendo.

01:30:36.234 --> 01:30:41.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just to clarify, it did come out this week that the version you're going to be getting is the Game Boy Advance version.

01:30:42.255 --> 01:30:46.557
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's no real way to do the GameCube emulation, I'm assuming on the 3DS right now.

01:30:46.917 --> 01:30:51.318
[SPEAKER_09]: The Game Boy Advance version is the version that you will be able to get on the 3DS.

01:30:51.798 --> 01:30:56.500
[SPEAKER_09]: No word yet about if it's going to be enhanced at all, kind of like Excitebike had...

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:00.081
[SPEAKER_09]: Very minimal thrills to kind of enhance it for widescreen and so forth.

01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:06.162
[SPEAKER_09]: No word if that's going to be given the same treatment for Zelda Four Swords or possibly even maybe online.

01:31:06.943 --> 01:31:08.223
[SPEAKER_09]: That might just be wishful thinking.

01:31:08.343 --> 01:31:08.783
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:12.464
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is the Game Boy Advance version that you're going to get for free later this year.

01:31:12.504 --> 01:31:15.865
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess free is not such a bad deal unless it's yours.

01:31:16.636 --> 01:31:18.397
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you have some rapid fire stuff for us?

01:31:18.838 --> 01:31:19.118
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

01:31:20.579 --> 01:31:23.241
[SPEAKER_05]: For Portal 2, there's some download content coming out.

01:31:23.261 --> 01:31:28.465
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Sixth Sense Motion Pack, but it only works with the Razer Hydra Motion Controller.

01:31:29.586 --> 01:31:31.928
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually get the pack, of course, through Steam.

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:34.270
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get the controller through Steam as well, and it's $140.

01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:38.553
[SPEAKER_05]: But it comes with a copy of Portal 2 and a download content.

01:31:39.534 --> 01:31:42.997
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if you already have Portal 2, then you have a gift for a friend.

01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:45.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Bros.

01:31:45.764 --> 01:31:46.805
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 Fan Remake Super Mario Bros.

01:31:46.825 --> 01:31:47.846
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 Fan Remake Super Mario Bros.

01:31:47.866 --> 01:31:48.927
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 Fan Remake Super Mario Bros.

01:31:48.947 --> 01:31:50.448
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 Fan Remake

01:32:11.945 --> 01:32:37.508
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually watched some of the video and it does look really nice by the way Sony is offering 6 months of Curiosity for PS3 owners basically you sign up for their little demo of the service and you can get a music unlimited option and then you can listen to whatever songs you want to pretty cool

01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:41.771
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty cool as long as it doesn't roll into a subscription or something like that.

01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:45.452
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that you'd have to check the site.

01:32:45.652 --> 01:32:56.695
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they were very careful about PlayStation Plus where they did go out of their way to say once the 30-day trial is up in the Welcome Back program, once the 30-day trial is up, you will not be charged at all.

01:32:56.755 --> 01:32:59.916
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually trying to get it.

01:32:59.936 --> 01:33:06.538
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to download my games and stuff, but right now we don't have... Remember, my PS3 doesn't have wireless internet.

01:33:06.658 --> 01:33:09.181
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind you only have until July something to do.

01:33:09.201 --> 01:33:09.582
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that.

01:33:09.682 --> 01:33:10.363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's July 3rd.

01:33:12.105 --> 01:33:13.006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to do it this week.

01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:17.692
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to drag an Ethernet cable out to the front room.

01:33:17.752 --> 01:33:19.555
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very fun.

01:33:20.615 --> 01:33:22.937
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get to the Twitter topics.

01:33:23.277 --> 01:33:27.700
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I get there, I've actually been purposely waiting on the PlayStation Plus.

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:43.129
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm waiting until right before the last day because if it is a 30-day trial, either something's got to come out real soon that makes me want to get it now to get the discount or whatever, or I'm going to wait and see if they maybe start putting on some real good stuff after it's not free anymore.

01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:44.030
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:46.131
[SPEAKER_09]: For most people that went in and jumped in day one.

01:33:46.191 --> 01:33:46.571
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

01:33:46.772 --> 01:33:47.092
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:33:47.672 --> 01:33:48.633
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it'll pay off, maybe not.

01:33:49.304 --> 01:33:50.885
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move into some Twitter topics.

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.706
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:33:52.807 --> 01:33:55.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week you show us your tweets and we read them here on air.

01:33:55.769 --> 01:33:56.069
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

01:33:56.729 --> 01:33:58.391
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:33:58.971 --> 01:34:01.393
[SPEAKER_09]: JV Mon sent us a string of tweets to start us off today.

01:34:02.413 --> 01:34:06.096
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically he went to Nintendo World and said there's a huge line for Zelda.

01:34:06.156 --> 01:34:07.677
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even realize they were showing that today.

01:34:07.997 --> 01:34:08.538
[SPEAKER_09]: But they were.

01:34:08.658 --> 01:34:09.739
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course this is New York City.

01:34:10.059 --> 01:34:13.822
[SPEAKER_09]: He says it easily goes down at least a block and a half before they start letting people in.

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.103
[SPEAKER_09]: and even sent a little picture.

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:22.325
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess these are people like going into the store because from this picture, it doesn't look very long, but the line's going like the other way.

01:34:22.785 --> 01:34:25.086
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it looks like there are huge crowds out there today.

01:34:25.406 --> 01:34:30.087
[SPEAKER_09]: And he says, the one time I forgot the 3DS at home, like everyone has them.

01:34:30.287 --> 01:34:33.268
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a street pass with like 100 people over at that event.

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:34.029
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazy.

01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:35.890
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, some other tweets.

01:34:38.112 --> 01:34:42.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Warrior Bob had tweeted, I just realized I've been listening to OLR for like seven years.

01:34:42.976 --> 01:34:43.597
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy carp.

01:34:44.297 --> 01:34:45.959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, some of our listeners have been listening a long time.

01:34:46.019 --> 01:34:48.000
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to all of you, of course, the listeners.

01:34:48.761 --> 01:34:50.082
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't be here if it weren't for your support.

01:34:50.122 --> 01:34:56.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether you just started listening this week or you've been there since episode one, which would be very few of you because I think we had 12 people listening that week.

01:34:56.808 --> 01:35:00.712
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you to you guys who've supported us from whatever time over the years.

01:35:01.532 --> 01:35:04.814
[SPEAKER_09]: Defective Candy sent us a tweet with a story from CNN.

01:35:05.434 --> 01:35:07.715
[SPEAKER_09]: Average age of a gamer goes up.

01:35:09.276 --> 01:35:15.198
[SPEAKER_09]: And CNN had reported here, I guess they were reporting about this 37-year-old.

01:35:16.199 --> 01:35:20.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I'm going to be 33 pretty soon, 37 does not seem that old at all.

01:35:20.461 --> 01:35:20.821
[SPEAKER_09]: In a row.

01:35:21.481 --> 01:35:25.163
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just kind of surprised they're talking about this whole thing like gamers are getting older.

01:35:25.985 --> 01:35:55.149
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just a lot of us grew up on games and haven't stopped because we just accepted as a part of our lives whereas I think back when the original Nintendo came out maybe 37 year olds at the time didn't get it quote unquote so I don't know but anyway they were talking about this whole thing about how gamers are getting older blah blah blah blockbuster games the social games and so on and so on yeah gamers are getting older because I think they just haven't left stuck with them

01:35:56.691 --> 01:36:01.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya says that he is plugging his first round of Where Are They Now interviews.

01:36:02.232 --> 01:36:04.873
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess some of the people, he's mentioned some of the people he's going to be interviewing.

01:36:05.233 --> 01:36:08.174
[SPEAKER_09]: Jessica Harper is going to be in one of the Where Are They Now interviews.

01:36:08.594 --> 01:36:14.796
[SPEAKER_09]: Vertu, who you might remember, he was the guy that was famous for passing Max 300 back in the day.

01:36:15.276 --> 01:36:15.836
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rice.

01:36:16.576 --> 01:36:17.156
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:36:42.874 --> 01:36:43.635
[SPEAKER_05]: We know where she is.

01:36:43.695 --> 01:36:49.098
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Jessica Harper, of course, is on Saturday nights on All Games Radio on her own show with Travis Donovan.

01:36:49.219 --> 01:36:50.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you guys listening?

01:36:50.359 --> 01:36:50.720
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:55.703
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I could tell you where she is now, but I'm sure there'll be some other little tidbits in there.

01:36:56.063 --> 01:37:03.528
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe she'll talk about how it was to have DDR Freak and Orange Lounge Radio kind of coexisting because it was an interesting history.

01:37:03.569 --> 01:37:05.470
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about it when she was here for the first time on the show.

01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:08.392
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't listen, you'll just have to go find that episode now.

01:37:09.244 --> 01:37:10.165
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37:26.616 --> 01:37:41.333
[SPEAKER_09]: Electronic Arts had a gun in the Godfather games called the Dillinger, and back in 2009, the grandson of Dillinger's half-sister threatened to sue EA unless they paid him millions of dollars.

01:37:42.114 --> 01:37:43.395
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's kind of sad.

01:37:43.795 --> 01:37:49.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a judge in Indiana this week said that the Dillinger descendant is not entitled to any money.

01:37:49.478 --> 01:37:52.399
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an Indiana law regarding a person's publicity right.

01:37:52.659 --> 01:37:55.020
[SPEAKER_09]: It was enacted after Dillinger died.

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:55.801
[SPEAKER_09]: So, sorry.

01:37:56.421 --> 01:37:59.282
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally sounds like a cash grab thing against a big corporation.

01:37:59.322 --> 01:38:01.023
[SPEAKER_09]: And he got basically laughed out of court.

01:38:01.444 --> 01:38:02.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody point and laugh.

01:38:03.064 --> 01:38:03.985
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:38:06.003 --> 01:38:07.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw links us one more story.

01:38:07.965 --> 01:38:13.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Miyamoto has said that virtual boy games on the 3DS, it could happen.

01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.712
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess wherever there's money to be made, right?

01:38:15.992 --> 01:38:23.598
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in an interview with GameSpot saying, quote from Miyamoto, well, that's not my exact plan, but something like that could happen.

01:38:23.999 --> 01:38:29.043
[SPEAKER_09]: I can say that in my photo album on my Nintendo 3DS, there is a photo of a virtual boy.

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:32.306
[SPEAKER_09]: So that says I do have a virtual boy at my disposal.

01:38:32.746 --> 01:38:33.067
[SPEAKER_09]: Laughs.

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:37.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Only 14 games were ever released in the West Virtual Boy Color

01:38:50.666 --> 01:38:51.826
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:38:51.886 --> 01:38:55.027
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be nice to see them redone in color, not red.

01:38:55.327 --> 01:38:57.567
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be neat to see them redo that, but we'll see.

01:38:57.847 --> 01:39:00.368
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully this time they won't give us migraines.

01:39:01.088 --> 01:39:01.608
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

01:39:02.008 --> 01:39:02.708
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the worst.

01:39:03.088 --> 01:39:03.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll see.

01:39:04.769 --> 01:39:06.329
[SPEAKER_09]: That does it for the Twitter topics tonight.

01:39:06.369 --> 01:39:07.989
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:39:08.049 --> 01:39:09.470
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hi to us throughout the week.

01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:13.610
[SPEAKER_09]: More news stories, mailbag soon, Skype line after that.

01:39:13.991 --> 01:39:16.311
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have plenty more to cover, so let's go to Loki.

01:39:17.182 --> 01:39:18.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

01:39:18.383 --> 01:39:26.327
[SPEAKER_02]: So, apparently, the long-talked-about Kinect for Windows software development kit has finally been released.

01:39:26.808 --> 01:39:28.149
[SPEAKER_02]: At least, the beta has.

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:34.893
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they have the versions available for 32-bit and 64-bit.

01:39:34.993 --> 01:39:38.375
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires Windows 7, and I guess it's for non-commercial use.

01:39:38.435 --> 01:39:39.515
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right now, you can...

01:39:40.896 --> 01:39:48.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Homebrew developers can make their own Kinect hacks or whatever and show them off.

01:39:49.001 --> 01:39:58.068
[SPEAKER_02]: One way you may be able to show them off is actually in this new vote for the next Kinect hack to become a Kinect Fun Labs toy.

01:39:58.788 --> 01:40:02.270
[SPEAKER_02]: They have voting up right now for a few different...

01:40:03.431 --> 01:40:05.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Hacks, six well-known ones, I guess.

01:40:06.915 --> 01:40:09.718
[SPEAKER_02]: The apps in question, Keyboard Anywhere.

01:40:10.139 --> 01:40:17.807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like the keyboard from Big, the floor keyboard where you can play just by stepping around the ground.

01:40:18.688 --> 01:40:20.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual Conductor Connect Body Art

01:40:37.841 --> 01:40:40.142
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand Puppets was shown off.

01:40:41.562 --> 01:40:47.205
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like a bird hand puppet that was being projected onto the wall that someone was manipulating with their arm.

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:51.567
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the camera saw you move your hand, it would move the puppet as well.

01:40:51.708 --> 01:40:53.128
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool.

01:40:53.328 --> 01:41:00.132
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital Pin Art, which is like those pin art devices where you can kind of make your hand imprint and stuff like that.

01:41:01.032 --> 01:41:01.472
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that.

01:41:01.572 --> 01:41:10.275
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Music Visualizer, which would be kind of just like it sounds, something you play music to, and it kind of makes these waveforms appear all throughout your room.

01:41:11.095 --> 01:41:13.156
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all.

01:41:14.716 --> 01:41:18.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now you can vote on those on ConnectShare.com.

01:41:20.498 --> 01:41:21.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played Kinect Fun Labs yet?

01:41:22.139 --> 01:41:22.239
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:23.320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so dopey.

01:41:25.041 --> 01:41:28.144
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really one of those things that's fun for five minutes and you're like, oh, okay.

01:41:28.284 --> 01:41:28.784
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's free.

01:41:29.145 --> 01:41:29.825
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's free.

01:41:29.885 --> 01:41:30.406
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't complain.

01:41:30.526 --> 01:41:32.487
[SPEAKER_09]: Free achievement points if you're into that sort of thing.

01:41:33.108 --> 01:41:39.953
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really the type of thing I think a bunch of people would get drunk and have a lot of fun making the little mini movies.

01:41:40.473 --> 01:41:44.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the one I did of the Sailor Moon that was like, I'll kill you and all that stuff.

01:41:44.876 --> 01:41:44.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:41:45.797 --> 01:41:46.137
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:41:46.737 --> 01:41:47.718
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it's kind of hokey.

01:41:47.738 --> 01:41:49.658
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want that keyboard thing to come out, though.

01:41:49.678 --> 01:41:50.278
[SPEAKER_09]: That would look kind of fun.

01:41:50.298 --> 01:41:52.259
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be longer than 15 seconds.

01:41:53.039 --> 01:41:54.620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they need to let you do more with that.

01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:56.700
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:02.742
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, moving on to one of the other announcements out of E3 was that there is a Silent Hill collection coming.

01:42:03.702 --> 01:42:09.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just a Metal Gear, but a game that's dear to us, the Silent Hill series, is getting an HD collection.

01:42:09.744 --> 01:42:10.524
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the catch.

01:42:10.584 --> 01:42:12.025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only on PlayStation 3.

01:42:12.825 --> 01:42:18.669
[SPEAKER_09]: It will only include Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3, but there will be new high-definition graphics.

01:42:18.849 --> 01:42:21.270
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now it's a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

01:42:22.111 --> 01:42:24.372
[SPEAKER_09]: According to the producer Tom Hewlett, quote,

01:42:27.794 --> 01:42:56.792
[SPEAKER_09]: so right now we're just aiming at a Sony exclusive which isn't to say that in the future it won't be available anywhere else but right now it's a Sony exclusive they are looking at a fall 2011 release by the way there is all new voice acting in this game as well it is being directed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and so there's a new actor that's going to be in the series let's see and I think a lot of this is because the other actor James Sunderland

01:42:57.472 --> 01:42:59.933
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't have such kind things to say about his participation in Silent Hill.

01:42:59.953 --> 01:43:00.694
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the name of the character.

01:43:00.894 --> 01:43:02.515
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, the guy who played James Sunderland.

01:43:02.535 --> 01:43:03.255
[SPEAKER_09]: Guy Sihi.

01:43:03.275 --> 01:43:03.936
[SPEAKER_09]: Guy Sihi.

01:43:04.736 --> 01:43:05.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, Yikes.

01:43:27.847 --> 01:43:27.967
[SPEAKER_09]: Yikes.

01:43:27.987 --> 01:43:30.630
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like we might have the real reason why all new voice acting is coming to the game.

01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.910
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

01:43:46.542 --> 01:44:13.821
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to put out You know, there is the Silent Hill Downpour game coming out soon Which, I don't know, I think the shark might have been jumped on Silent Hill We might kind of be done with it And if we weren't... If this wasn't the nail in the coffin The game's soundtrack, of course, no longer by Akira Yamaoka It's by Dan Licht, who did the music for Dexter The theme song is being written by...

01:44:14.541 --> 01:44:16.603
[SPEAKER_09]: and Korn, the metal band.

01:44:17.343 --> 01:44:18.084
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.

01:44:18.244 --> 01:44:20.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Korn is doing the theme song to the game.

01:44:21.326 --> 01:44:23.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, remember the 90s, you guys?

01:44:23.388 --> 01:44:24.289
[SPEAKER_09]: Weren't they awesome?

01:44:24.469 --> 01:44:30.954
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, though, I have to listen to the actual song first because just because it's done by Korn doesn't mean it's going to be terrible.

01:44:31.354 --> 01:44:40.280
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very good likelihood that it's going to be terrible, but there's some artists out there that can do scores that aren't terrible.

01:44:40.601 --> 01:44:41.682
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, this is Korn.

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:42.622
[SPEAKER_09]: Korn's not scoring it.

01:44:42.642 --> 01:44:43.523
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just doing the theme song.

01:44:43.792 --> 01:45:08.979
[SPEAKER_09]: well if also though if you want to look at versatility I mean Daft Punk did do the entire Tron Legacy soundtrack and it was quite different than their usual stuff true but when that was announced everybody said that's fucking awesome and that makes sense but Korn doing Silent Hills is kind of like do not want like the guy doing uh the guy that did Dexter um the score for Dexter doing the score for this game I don't think it's gonna be that bad I think that would be

01:45:09.119 --> 01:45:10.000
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that'd be alright.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:13.663
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the reality is Akira Yamaoka is moved on.

01:45:13.763 --> 01:45:14.663
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing something else now.

01:45:14.763 --> 01:45:15.704
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not gonna have that.

01:45:15.724 --> 01:45:18.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's doing something else, that's for sure.

01:45:20.328 --> 01:45:23.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Neon Genesis, he's been killing the music game.

01:45:24.511 --> 01:45:25.872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.

01:45:26.012 --> 01:45:27.353
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not his big project, though.

01:45:27.433 --> 01:45:28.975
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, it's just weird.

01:45:29.375 --> 01:45:29.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:45:31.116 --> 01:45:34.359
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see what happens with the Korn theme song.

01:45:34.559 --> 01:45:36.761
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, some of you still love your Korn.

01:45:37.814 --> 01:45:39.895
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm allergic to corn I love Poe I love Poe Which one?

01:45:39.915 --> 01:45:39.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh

01:46:05.521 --> 01:46:06.482
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, which is like a great song.

01:46:06.682 --> 01:46:08.424
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh my god, this game has Poe.

01:46:08.705 --> 01:46:09.265
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

01:46:10.386 --> 01:46:11.027
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something random.

01:46:11.047 --> 01:46:15.372
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Alan Wake has probably been in development since 98, but... Here's something random.

01:46:15.692 --> 01:46:20.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost every CD that I've burned except for my very last one has Trigger Happy Jack on it.

01:46:21.659 --> 01:46:23.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being?

01:46:23.521 --> 01:46:23.721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:46:23.941 --> 01:46:24.582
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great song.

01:46:24.602 --> 01:46:25.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking love Poe.

01:46:25.983 --> 01:46:26.464
[SPEAKER_09]: However...

01:46:28.234 --> 01:46:29.115
[SPEAKER_09]: How about some Nintendo news?

01:46:43.496 --> 01:46:44.557
[SPEAKER_09]: How about some Nintendo news?

01:47:13.759 --> 01:47:19.963
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they also said that it should be able to handle 60 frames per second with 8 players in both online, offline, 2D, and 3D.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:21.244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

01:47:21.964 --> 01:47:28.369
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, in addition to that, is Red Flare 3DS.

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:33.892
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan is going to be getting a bright red one with a...

01:47:37.454 --> 01:48:03.153
[SPEAKER_05]: and they actually put out some press about that around the E3 time and that it looks like it's going to also with new Wii bundles there's going to be on June 23rd Wii Sports Resort and a Wii Remote Plus in the same color as the console and it should be about 250 bucks or 20,000 yen

01:48:07.864 --> 01:48:11.186
[SPEAKER_09]: The Red 3DS looks kind of cool, I gotta say.

01:48:11.246 --> 01:48:12.186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty awesome color.

01:48:12.226 --> 01:48:13.827
[SPEAKER_09]: If they'd had that at launch, I would've got that color.

01:48:15.028 --> 01:48:16.508
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me think of an old Famicom.

01:48:17.309 --> 01:48:17.429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

01:48:18.009 --> 01:48:21.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it is weird to me how the top screen doesn't change colors.

01:48:21.411 --> 01:48:24.292
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess it's part of the whole 3D effect thing.

01:48:24.332 --> 01:48:29.615
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I read somewhere that they can't change colors because it would harm the 3D effect, but whatever.

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.649
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that because your frame colors are going to affect your perception.

01:48:36.371 --> 01:48:41.222
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I like for some reason like displaying most art is good on a room with a light pink wall.

01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:44.091
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a link to the image in the chat room.

01:49:07.671 --> 01:49:07.951
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:49:08.953 --> 01:49:10.274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's move on with some more news.

01:49:10.875 --> 01:49:13.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not too terrible, but anyways.

01:49:14.298 --> 01:49:15.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other fun stuff here.

01:49:15.259 --> 01:49:19.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk a little bit about Nintendo and the Wii U again.

01:49:19.724 --> 01:49:27.493
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, one of the things that people are asking, because it's somewhat popular to have some free-to-play games on different platforms...

01:49:28.313 --> 01:49:35.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is not interested in freemium games and saying that it hurts the value of games.

01:49:36.699 --> 01:49:45.525
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I myself am one of the game developers who in the future wants to make efforts so that the value of software will be appreciated by the consumers.

01:49:46.125 --> 01:49:54.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Although freemium games can make money through ads and microtransactions, they're expressing concern about destroying the value of the game's software.

01:49:55.231 --> 01:50:09.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, I think it's all because they want to sell virtual console games for $5 versus $0.99 that you can get for a great game on some other platforms like Android and the iOS and stuff like that.

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:12.964
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that all $0.99 games that come out on those are very good.

01:50:13.084 --> 01:50:21.590
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of which, I just want to throw out there, there's a big sale going on this weekend for games for $0.99 on iOS, and it's the company Gameloft, which...

01:50:22.691 --> 01:50:29.193
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they're a little, because they kind of rip off games, but they do a pretty decent job from what I understand of ripping off games.

01:50:29.213 --> 01:50:31.473
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just bought two of them because all the games are 99 cents right now.

01:50:31.813 --> 01:50:35.614
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought Order and Chaos, which is their WoW clone on the phone.

01:50:35.654 --> 01:50:40.575
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hear it's definitely not WoW, but for an iPhone, it is kind of impressive.

01:50:40.655 --> 01:50:45.536
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Eternal Legacy, which try to guess what it's a clone of just from the little icon.

01:50:45.656 --> 01:50:46.197
[SPEAKER_09]: I already know.

01:50:47.437 --> 01:50:50.217
[SPEAKER_09]: It's literally, I'll show it to DarkSakura in the bottom right-hand corner there on my phone.

01:50:50.918 --> 01:50:52.158
[SPEAKER_09]: I just downloaded it while I'm here.

01:50:52.959 --> 01:50:53.999
[SPEAKER_09]: Who does that look like to you?

01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:55.841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:50:55.881 --> 01:50:56.962
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell the listeners, who does that look like to you?

01:50:56.982 --> 01:50:57.683
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks very cloud.

01:50:57.803 --> 01:50:59.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a Final Fantasy VII ripoff.

01:51:02.048 --> 01:51:05.350
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're 99 cents, and I hear they're good rip-offs, so we'll see.

01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:06.671
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you about those next week.

01:51:07.152 --> 01:51:09.633
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, sorry to deviate from the story.

01:51:10.054 --> 01:51:11.395
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's that mean exactly?

01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:20.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Ghost Recon Online is a free-played game on PC, and it's going to be on the Wii U. Well, expect it not to be free-to-play.

01:51:20.721 --> 01:51:23.423
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of unfortunate.

01:51:23.844 --> 01:51:24.784
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's very long.

01:51:26.005 --> 01:51:28.427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very far away, so maybe they'll change their mind, but

01:51:30.473 --> 01:51:33.715
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just Nintendo being Nintendo, whatever.

01:51:34.656 --> 01:51:58.892
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, people were hoping that because the Zelda 25th anniversary is happening right now that maybe Nintendo's going to do something cool like they did with, well, I wouldn't exactly call it cool because all they did was port a fucking Super Nintendo game to the Wii, but they were hoping that there would be some sort of Legend of Zelda anthology or something like that that would come out with all the Zelda games.

01:52:00.593 --> 01:52:01.613
[SPEAKER_02]: on a disc or something.

01:52:02.353 --> 01:52:10.115
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they said, uh, no, they're not going to do that because they didn't want to do the same thing two years in a row.

01:52:12.515 --> 01:52:13.715
[SPEAKER_02]: That was their excuse.

01:52:13.875 --> 01:52:15.636
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want to do the same thing two years in a row.

01:52:17.756 --> 01:52:21.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Nintendo, you just make it too damn easy.

01:52:21.757 --> 01:52:23.517
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to do the same thing two years in a row.

01:52:23.557 --> 01:52:29.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, re-release all these old-ass games and, you know, mark them as new or, I don't know, uh,

01:52:32.043 --> 01:52:36.144
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like Mario Galaxy and Mario Galaxy 2 released not too far apart.

01:52:36.424 --> 01:52:38.845
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's within two years.

01:52:39.925 --> 01:52:41.185
[SPEAKER_09]: How about new Super Mario Bros.

01:52:41.486 --> 01:52:42.906
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii and new Super Mario Bros.

01:52:43.146 --> 01:52:43.446
[SPEAKER_09]: Mii?

01:52:44.066 --> 01:52:46.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they don't want to do... I'm kidding, Mii's not a game.

01:52:46.507 --> 01:52:47.727
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, here's what they want to do.

01:52:47.747 --> 01:52:54.789
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to release all that shit on a virtual console for the 3DS or something and charge you separately for everything.

01:52:55.009 --> 01:52:57.570
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, they kind of already did it back on the GameCube, too.

01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

01:53:14.756 --> 01:53:15.796
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't want to do that.

01:53:16.396 --> 01:53:17.237
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to do it.

01:53:19.597 --> 01:53:20.577
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what they're going to do?

01:53:20.877 --> 01:53:22.578
[SPEAKER_02]: I will bet you money.

01:53:23.378 --> 01:53:26.859
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, because that wonderful Wii U doesn't play GameCube games.

01:53:27.519 --> 01:53:34.320
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means it's time to do some more of those... Virtual console GameCube games.

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:37.941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more the new PlayMotion games.

01:53:38.221 --> 01:53:41.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how they had that for a while where they're going to take old-ass...

01:53:42.742 --> 01:53:46.263
[SPEAKER_02]: GameCube Games and straight port them over with Wii controls.

01:53:47.163 --> 01:53:48.403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what they're going to do.

01:53:48.903 --> 01:53:49.564
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

01:53:50.024 --> 01:53:59.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, as long as F-Zero is one of those games, because I'm kind of pissed that I didn't hear about a new F-Zero, but I guess it was just dreaming anyway.

01:54:00.766 --> 01:54:03.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on to another story.

01:54:03.226 --> 01:54:04.346
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an F-Zero 64, right?

01:54:05.287 --> 01:54:06.667
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that's already on Virtual Console.

01:54:06.687 --> 01:54:07.087
[SPEAKER_09]: That's been out.

01:54:07.107 --> 01:54:07.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what they're going to do.

01:54:08.007 --> 01:54:09.487
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to import that shit to the 3DS.

01:54:09.608 --> 01:54:10.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god!

01:54:11.528 --> 01:54:11.888
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

01:54:13.107 --> 01:54:15.589
[SPEAKER_09]: This was kind of an interesting story from the weekend.

01:54:15.630 --> 01:54:18.953
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about Duke Nukem Forever, and it has to do with those negative reviews and so forth.

01:54:19.013 --> 01:54:23.178
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you heard about what happened, but on Twitter...

01:54:24.690 --> 01:54:35.537
[SPEAKER_09]: This gentleman named James Redner, he is the founder of the Redner Group who was representing 2K Games and was representing some of the games like Duke Nukem Forever and so forth.

01:54:36.417 --> 01:54:40.520
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually put a tweet out that said, Too many went far with their reviews.

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.023
[SPEAKER_09]: We are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's Venom.

01:54:45.423 --> 01:54:47.544
[SPEAKER_09]: He followed it with, Bad scores are fine.

01:54:47.924 --> 01:54:50.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Venom filled reviews, that's completely different.

01:54:50.786 --> 01:54:54.029
[SPEAKER_09]: He did follow up his, I don't know, he was probably high or drunk when he did it.

01:54:54.289 --> 01:54:58.453
[SPEAKER_09]: He deleted the tweets and then apologized saying that he was just acting under emotions.

01:54:58.533 --> 01:55:03.398
[SPEAKER_09]: He was just being very emotional and his panties were very bunched and he wrote those tweets in anger.

01:55:03.838 --> 01:55:05.439
[SPEAKER_09]: But 2K Games sacked him.

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:13.547
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, 2K Games does not endorse the comments made by Jim Redner and we can confirm that the Redner Group no longer represents our products.

01:55:13.807 --> 01:55:16.950
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a very public bitch slapping of that.

01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:18.210
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:55:35.497 --> 01:55:36.979
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, are you going to print a good review?

01:55:37.039 --> 01:55:42.545
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've heard these stories about embargoes that are allowed to be lifted only if you give the game a good review.

01:55:42.905 --> 01:55:49.012
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can get a sneak peek at this game if you gave such and such game a good review.

01:55:49.052 --> 01:55:51.114
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's shady shit that happens.

01:55:51.174 --> 01:55:52.195
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why we tell you

01:55:52.796 --> 01:56:02.585
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of times the reviews that you trust most come from the indie sites that are buying these games themselves and not going through these PR agencies.

01:56:02.925 --> 01:56:09.791
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not knocking all PR agencies because some of them do really great things and they do really help out and get questions answered and so forth.

01:56:09.811 --> 01:56:13.614
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, there's a lot of shady shit that happens out there.

01:56:13.794 --> 01:56:16.076
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't think this happens on a...

01:56:16.897 --> 01:56:17.477
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:56:45.587 --> 01:56:47.188
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they each got one.

01:56:47.508 --> 01:56:52.450
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what you do in that kind of case is you just start, you know, you quote them as the source.

01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:54.671
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, you just quote them as the source.

01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:57.532
[SPEAKER_09]: But then it's like, you know, you're sending people back to the big websites.

01:56:57.892 --> 01:56:59.592
[SPEAKER_02]: How's anybody supposed to start a new website?

01:56:59.613 --> 01:57:00.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily.

01:57:00.233 --> 01:57:08.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, there was a story I read this week that went back about three different websites and people kept quoting the one that was quoting the other one that was quoting the other one.

01:57:08.656 --> 01:57:10.477
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you can do that.

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:11.837
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:57:12.778 --> 01:57:13.839
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to the mailbag.

01:57:13.959 --> 01:57:16.360
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week at Orange Lounge Radio, we welcome your emails.

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:19.683
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:57:19.703 --> 01:57:23.065
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to dive into the email bag headfirst and read your emails.

01:57:23.605 --> 01:57:28.889
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura wants to set it out tonight because she's going to be nursing her throat with some tea so she doesn't cough and die on air.

01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:38.175
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to read some emails tonight, and we're going to start with a couple here from Holly D. Holly D. in chat says, Are you guys going to make an Orange Lounge guild for Rift like you did with WoW?

01:57:38.555 --> 01:57:39.936
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, let us know the shard.

01:57:41.657 --> 01:58:09.632
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing official from my standpoint I actually let my Rift subscription lapse sorry it's just I didn't want to pay for multiple games at once so I might go back to it later like if there's a really cool expansion or something but I let it lapse so I don't know if there's enough Rift people out there then by all means we should start something but I don't know if we have a lot of OLR listeners playing Rift we'll have to see ask on the forums that would be a good place to check that out orangelongradio.com

01:58:11.732 --> 01:58:15.813
[SPEAKER_09]: Holly sends us another email about Sony and more hacks going on.

01:58:16.213 --> 01:58:24.935
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently being hacked once, writes Holly, and taking the network down, then again, then on a different website, compromising millions of accounts, it has happened again.

01:58:25.336 --> 01:58:30.357
[SPEAKER_09]: This time it was not customer information, but the entirety of the source code for the PSN network.

01:58:30.777 --> 01:58:31.037
[SPEAKER_09]: How?

01:58:31.698 --> 01:58:33.759
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony never fixed the original vulnerability.

01:58:34.059 --> 01:58:37.281
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone waited for four weeks for PSN to come back for nothing.

01:58:37.681 --> 01:58:39.342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good that that leaked out.

01:58:39.382 --> 01:58:45.604
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not just sure if this level of idiocy can be covered by the phrase monumental stupidity, but I'm sure it's a start.

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:47.465
[SPEAKER_09]: And we get linked to a website.

01:58:48.246 --> 01:58:53.128
[SPEAKER_09]: She links us to a story from JupiterBroadcasting.com, which I don't think I've ever heard of.

01:58:55.774 --> 01:58:56.815
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's see.

01:58:56.895 --> 01:59:08.505
[SPEAKER_09]: A hacker group got into hacking Sony on June 6th and they leaked the source code to the Sony PSN developers network and that could allow people to find more flaws of the Sony system very quickly.

01:59:09.366 --> 01:59:11.808
[SPEAKER_09]: It could also open up a private PSN network.

01:59:12.688 --> 01:59:18.293
[SPEAKER_09]: They got all the source code and of course this was all happening after Sony was supposed to be fixed.

01:59:18.553 --> 01:59:22.297
[SPEAKER_09]: The hacker group used an SQL injection attack against Sony Pictures.

01:59:22.717 --> 01:59:27.101
[SPEAKER_09]: They got 150,000 records from the database of more than 4.5 million records.

01:59:27.721 --> 01:59:28.001
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:59:33.146 --> 01:59:33.987
[SPEAKER_09]: Hackers gonna hack.

01:59:34.347 --> 01:59:37.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that that makes it right, but again, change passwords.

01:59:38.851 --> 01:59:40.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Use different passwords on different websites.

01:59:41.473 --> 01:59:45.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to an email now from Janai.

01:59:45.895 --> 01:59:53.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear OLR, I found a horror point-and-click game on the Xbox Live Indie Games section called Decay.

01:59:53.698 --> 01:59:58.260
[SPEAKER_09]: I can describe it as Deja Vu meets Silent Hill in an atmospheric way.

01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:01.862
[SPEAKER_09]: There are three episodes costing 240 Microsoft points each.

02:00:02.302 --> 02:00:04.723
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is a highly polished game for an indie developer.

02:00:05.043 --> 02:00:06.643
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to hear your comments on this game

02:00:31.095 --> 02:00:32.956
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the idea of more point and click adventure games.

02:00:34.257 --> 02:00:39.101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like there's part two, part three, part four is the final part.

02:00:40.241 --> 02:00:40.862
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

02:00:42.063 --> 02:00:42.823
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to check that out.

02:00:43.484 --> 02:00:43.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

02:00:44.584 --> 02:00:45.685
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is Twitter music playing?

02:00:47.787 --> 02:00:48.327
[SPEAKER_09]: Audio fail.

02:00:49.921 --> 02:00:54.843
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to another email from Haseo Sumiragawa.

02:00:55.324 --> 02:00:56.424
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:56.544 --> 02:01:04.828
[SPEAKER_09]: I make music videos using cutscenes from video games, and I'm having trouble finding a download site that uses the right kind of codec that works on Windows Movie Maker.

02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:07.090
[SPEAKER_09]: It says that it's an unregistered file.

02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:08.950
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Loki, you're good with movies, right?

02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.591
[SPEAKER_09]: You should listen to this.

02:01:10.211 --> 02:01:13.355
[SPEAKER_09]: I make music videos using cutscenes for video games.

02:01:13.395 --> 02:01:17.840
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having trouble finding a download site that has the right kind of codec that works on Windows Movie Maker.

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:22.385
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you three or the chat could help in directing me to that area, I would be grateful.

02:01:22.525 --> 02:01:24.848
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for Bayonetta cutscenes preferably.

02:01:25.749 --> 02:01:28.212
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you get cutscenes that you can use in Windows Movie Maker?

02:01:29.487 --> 02:01:32.068
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what exactly Windows Movie Maker uses.

02:01:32.128 --> 02:01:34.329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's just Windows Media stuff.

02:01:34.389 --> 02:01:44.473
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's all about having the correct codecs on your system, on your PC, so just download some of the community codec packs and stuff like that and hopefully they'll work.

02:01:45.293 --> 02:01:47.494
[SPEAKER_09]: You can even dump YouTubes to movie files, right?

02:01:47.534 --> 02:01:47.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you?

02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:49.855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the best quality.

02:01:49.875 --> 02:01:51.436
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't if you have the right stuff.

02:01:52.196 --> 02:01:54.497
[SPEAKER_05]: I use RealPlayer to download them offline.

02:01:54.617 --> 02:01:56.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa, RealPlayer still exists?

02:01:56.698 --> 02:02:03.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually, a real player has a download thing that'll convert it to MP4 or anything.

02:02:03.927 --> 02:02:07.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, real players are what I used to use to watch episodes of Downloaded South Park in, like, 98.

02:02:08.789 --> 02:02:32.282
[SPEAKER_02]: or just like you know looking for like some sort of universal file converters and stuff like that see if you can find anything that's meant for that because I've really I honestly don't use Movie Maker I use Adobe Premiere so that usually doesn't have a problem opening anything here's some comments from our chat room at chat.orange.com Scott Pilgrim says there's your problem you use Windows Movie Maker but download the K-Lite codec pack that should help

02:02:33.162 --> 02:03:01.899
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says get a Linux distro and use Kdenlive and SSJ100 Matt even backs it up saying download something other than Windows Movie Maker Frisbee says or OpenShot that might be tough because Windows Movie Maker might be the program you're comfortable with but there are other alternatives out there they're all basically the same there's a little bit of a learning curve for example Premiere when I first started using it I was like what the hell am I doing and now I'm a little bit more comfortable with it now that I've used it for a while

02:03:02.159 --> 02:03:28.303
[SPEAKER_09]: MovieMaker I tried using one time and I don't know it it's a little too basic we use Adobe Audition actually to produce the podcast and at first it can look really overwhelming because there's all these features that you know for a podcast you don't really need but all the you know sound the opening that you hear was was kind of mixed together in Audition you know so Adobe products are pretty good anyhow let's go on to the rest of the email here from Haseo Sumiragawa

02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:32.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I would like to chime in with the new gimmicky systems announced at E3.

02:03:32.832 --> 02:03:34.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Both have really lame names.

02:03:35.473 --> 02:03:38.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Who in their right minds came up with Vita and Wii U?

02:03:38.754 --> 02:03:40.575
[SPEAKER_09]: Shame on you, Sony, Nintendo.

02:03:40.955 --> 02:03:42.315
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw this coming.

02:03:42.655 --> 02:03:44.096
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for reading my humble little email.

02:03:44.116 --> 02:03:50.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Vita, I'm not too... It's a weird name, but they also have the Sony VAIO, and that works.

02:03:50.758 --> 02:03:53.179
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the PSV that comes out of that.

02:03:53.239 --> 02:03:55.740
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that might have been something they were going for.

02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:58.701
[SPEAKER_02]: But all they had to do was, like, PSP2.

02:03:58.881 --> 02:04:01.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Why has it got to be something fancy like the Vita?

02:04:02.202 --> 02:04:06.303
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I think that with that whole back thing, they could have called it the PlayStation Touch.

02:04:07.284 --> 02:04:08.344
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it could be the Psst.

02:04:09.444 --> 02:04:09.764
Psst.

02:04:11.745 --> 02:04:12.165
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:13.186
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be clever.

02:04:13.306 --> 02:04:15.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking for Groot, Barrett & Holt, PST.

02:04:15.526 --> 02:04:19.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the PlayStation Reach Around, because you can reach around the back.

02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:46.221
[SPEAKER_09]: and Fondle the Back Wii U is definitely one that's getting a lot of people have made the joke about I thought it was a university for Mario things like that but you gotta go well everybody made fun of Wii when it first came out so again let's see the games to back up the name Wii U does not

02:04:48.786 --> 02:04:49.947
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:05:09.645 --> 02:05:09.945
[SPEAKER_09]: Weird.

02:05:10.766 --> 02:05:12.127
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, weird, weird.

02:05:12.708 --> 02:05:15.411
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on with some other emails.

02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:18.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Wii U, we have an email from...

02:05:21.153 --> 02:05:28.923
[SPEAKER_09]: I let the Wii U and subsequent chatter in the back of my brain for a while and here's a few things that fell out.

02:05:29.223 --> 02:05:33.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, Wii U, like Michael Patcher said, is the dumbest name ever.

02:05:33.529 --> 02:05:36.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, it is the most memorable name ever too.

02:05:36.993 --> 02:05:38.034
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't hurt the sales.

02:05:38.875 --> 02:05:42.117
[SPEAKER_09]: 2.

02:05:39.376 --> 02:05:42.117
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii U is in danger by revealing its hand too soon.

02:05:42.438 --> 02:05:46.420
[SPEAKER_09]: The PS Vita could do the same thing for the PS3 if they want to steal the idea.

02:05:47.181 --> 02:05:53.025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with you there, Robabub, because the PSP... Remember, in 2006, they were showing the Ridge Racer with the rearview mirror.

02:05:54.506 --> 02:06:00.390
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if the iPad had a working controller pad dock similar to the Wii U tablet, it could instantly steal the idea.

02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:04.013
[SPEAKER_09]: And look, you can play your games anywhere you want instead of being stuck at home.

02:06:04.153 --> 02:06:05.754
[SPEAKER_02]: The iPad 2 can already do that.

02:06:06.194 --> 02:06:10.317
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't I see a story this week about some racing game that was being played through the Apple TV unit?

02:06:10.337 --> 02:06:13.220
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had that for a while where they were doing that.

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:17.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it was Real Racing 2 HD, and you can do that through the HDMI port.

02:06:18.483 --> 02:06:42.394
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the tablet as like a map and stuff so you can do that already and I mean that may be a way that they're gonna combat this stuff especially especially if they decide hey later on that we're gonna go ahead and you know put out Apple TV that plays games then they're gonna have you know you're gonna control stuff with your iPod or whatever and iPad and you may have that similar type of stuff so I don't know

02:06:42.834 --> 02:06:47.336
[SPEAKER_09]: And one more thing, Michael Patcher thought Vita was the second worst name for a system.

02:06:47.736 --> 02:06:48.377
[SPEAKER_09]: I disagree.

02:06:48.557 --> 02:06:52.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Since Vita has meaning in and of itself, I need to give Sony credit for it.

02:06:52.579 --> 02:06:57.301
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, his analysis of Nintendo and Sony indicate a bias towards Sony not backed up by history.

02:06:57.701 --> 02:06:59.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, Ma, I'm a video game analyst.

02:07:00.302 --> 02:07:00.623
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

02:07:00.663 --> 02:07:03.024
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope the Vita doesn't get the name of Vita Max.

02:07:03.184 --> 02:07:05.545
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they start calling it Vita Vita Vegemen, but that's just me.

02:07:06.681 --> 02:07:11.605
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, this Patcher guy, you could look at him the same way we talked about reviewers earlier in the show.

02:07:12.105 --> 02:07:17.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet a lot of you guys listen to us every week because, you know, we're the show where every gamer has a voice, but we're the three that you hear every week.

02:07:17.949 --> 02:07:23.193
[SPEAKER_09]: And you probably keep listening to us because you kind of like what we have to say, you know, in our analysis.

02:07:23.253 --> 02:07:29.477
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we joke about it on the show sometimes that we're also video game analysts, or as I say, video game analists sometimes.

02:07:29.617 --> 02:07:51.414
[SPEAKER_09]: but uh it's it's sort of true I think you guys tune into the show because you like our perspective on things and you know I don't know this guy I don't know this Michael Patcher guy so I'm not trying to say this disrespectfully but what the fuck makes him so goddamn special like you know I see his name everywhere and on these websites and stuff but he's just some asshole spouting off predictions just like me

02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:55.200
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess he has a degree or something?

02:07:56.021 --> 02:07:59.502
[SPEAKER_02]: He works for Web Rush Morgan, I believe.

02:08:03.783 --> 02:08:04.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:04.663
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

02:08:04.683 --> 02:08:08.465
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy... Does anyone call him out for all the stuff that he's wrong on?

02:08:08.565 --> 02:08:09.705
[SPEAKER_02]: No, everyone forgets.

02:08:10.385 --> 02:08:12.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone reports about what he says.

02:08:12.386 --> 02:08:17.167
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like when they were reporting about Voldemort talking about this and that and stuff.

02:08:17.187 --> 02:08:18.568
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone reports on it because...

02:08:19.148 --> 02:08:19.808
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they do.

02:08:19.828 --> 02:08:21.148
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always saying something.

02:08:21.289 --> 02:08:22.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about it.

02:08:23.409 --> 02:08:23.889
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying this.

02:08:23.909 --> 02:08:25.349
[SPEAKER_02]: He must have some insider information.

02:08:25.449 --> 02:08:26.030
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he doesn't.

02:08:26.090 --> 02:08:27.510
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a guy guessing on stuff.

02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:29.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Except he gets paid a lot more than I do.

02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:30.231
[SPEAKER_09]: He has a different background.

02:08:30.411 --> 02:08:32.051
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm not trying to sound disrespectful.

02:08:32.211 --> 02:08:42.613
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize this comes off completely rude, but the reality is I care no more or no less about his opinion than I do Roboba's opinion.

02:08:44.034 --> 02:08:44.694
[SPEAKER_09]: They're equal to me.

02:08:44.794 --> 02:08:45.474
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both gamers.

02:08:47.045 --> 02:08:47.845
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:51.087
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I like Robaba just slightly more because he actually listens to the show.

02:08:51.348 --> 02:08:52.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Hatcher is not a gamer.

02:08:52.508 --> 02:08:54.049
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't know shit about games.

02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:57.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Robaba is great.

02:08:57.691 --> 02:09:00.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com Here comes Ego Boost.

02:09:00.713 --> 02:09:00.993
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:08.738
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman says, We listen to you every week because one week we expect DarkSakura to announce her plans for world domination and she needs followers, right?

02:09:09.198 --> 02:09:10.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that was in like episode four.

02:09:12.290 --> 02:09:15.892
[SPEAKER_05]: Best besides that, why would I announce my plans for world domination?

02:09:15.972 --> 02:09:19.193
[SPEAKER_09]: Her plan for world domination is give me a dollar or a taco.

02:09:19.773 --> 02:09:20.934
[SPEAKER_05]: No, why would I announce it?

02:09:20.974 --> 02:09:26.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's going to be mysterious and who knows, I might have already taken over the world.

02:09:27.797 --> 02:09:54.913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that I don't want the responsibility We already are the official video game podcast of the galaxy We are We talked about this a long time ago Is that we've declared that we are the official video game podcast of the galaxy And that's that Dibs, patent pending But actually I do have to say that, you know Dominating the entire world Think about all of the paperwork And all of the stuff you'd have to manage I just like, I'll let the world fuck itself up

02:09:56.129 --> 02:09:57.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, we did give Bobby Pluto.

02:09:57.930 --> 02:09:58.430
[SPEAKER_09]: We did give that.

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:00.852
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby can have all of the dwarf planets.

02:10:01.872 --> 02:10:06.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Ceres, Pluto, and its oddly shaped moons.

02:10:06.835 --> 02:10:07.735
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

02:10:10.097 --> 02:10:10.697
[SPEAKER_09]: One other email.

02:10:10.717 --> 02:10:12.538
[SPEAKER_09]: Last email tonight from Spazinator.

02:10:14.296 --> 02:10:16.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Your space bar is broken or something.

02:10:16.437 --> 02:10:17.957
[SPEAKER_09]: You have words running together here.

02:10:19.358 --> 02:10:20.538
[SPEAKER_09]: Was this typed on a PSP?

02:10:20.658 --> 02:10:20.958
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:10:20.978 --> 02:10:23.079
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, I'm going to do my best to get through this email.

02:10:23.679 --> 02:10:24.519
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR.

02:10:24.979 --> 02:10:32.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of the usual topics that I typically bring up via email and Twitter topics, I thought I'd give my impressions of a recent downloadable game release.

02:10:32.321 --> 02:10:35.522
[SPEAKER_09]: Magic the Gathering Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, a.k.a.

02:10:35.582 --> 02:10:35.882
[SPEAKER_09]: Magic 2012.

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:38.323
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot that came out this week, but it's only 2011.

02:10:39.463 --> 02:10:40.024
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so fine.

02:10:40.064 --> 02:10:41.485
[SPEAKER_09]: Magic 2012 is coming out.

02:10:42.145 --> 02:10:43.366
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like these kind of emails.

02:10:43.746 --> 02:10:47.189
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear reviews, especially on games I haven't played but I have a slight interest in.

02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:49.631
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the last Magic game, so let's see.

02:10:51.308 --> 02:10:58.355
[SPEAKER_09]: For those out there that are unfamiliar with the Magic games, this is the second in the series, which is the video game adaptation of Magic the Gathering card game.

02:10:58.856 --> 02:11:07.404
[SPEAKER_09]: Those who have played the card game at one point or another will have practically no problem picking up this game, while newbies might have a marginally more difficult time with it due to the learning curve.

02:11:07.704 --> 02:11:08.825
[SPEAKER_09]: But even then, it's not too bad.

02:11:09.246 --> 02:11:11.068
[SPEAKER_09]: All in all, it's a faithful recreation of the game.

02:11:11.428 --> 02:11:15.212
[SPEAKER_09]: Those who have picked up the original game last year really should pick up this one as well.

02:11:15.532 --> 02:11:32.291
[SPEAKER_09]: there are no noticeable bugs at least on the PSN version and from what I can tell the devs have taken user input to heart and implemented much needed improvements while it's not perfect it's a drastic improvement over the first assuming that you haven't picked up the original game yet you want to pick up a cheap game I suggest passing

02:11:33.292 --> 02:11:37.175
[SPEAKER_09]: I suggest passing over the original game and just going for Magic 2012.

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:46.041
[SPEAKER_09]: Frankly, I find this to be pretty damn fun in a major time sink, rivaling the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in terms of amount of time that will inevitably be spent in this game.

02:11:46.561 --> 02:11:54.387
[SPEAKER_09]: While the single player stuff is fun and will be played a lot initially for the purposes of unlocking stuff, the real meat and potatoes of the game is the multiplayer, which frankly is a blast.

02:11:54.807 --> 02:12:00.954
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, if you're a trophy or achievement whore, the 20 achievements or trophies in the game are easiest hell to get, even by my standards.

02:12:01.295 --> 02:12:04.599
[SPEAKER_09]: Even my grandmother can get them easily, and she's been dead for 14 years.

02:12:05.059 --> 02:12:06.341
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that was morbid.

02:12:07.213 --> 02:12:09.255
[SPEAKER_09]: All in all, I can't recommend this game enough.

02:12:09.655 --> 02:12:17.542
[SPEAKER_09]: It is available for both Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft Points and on PSN at its regular price for non-PS Plus members for $9.99.

02:12:18.082 --> 02:12:24.007
[SPEAKER_09]: However, due to most people having a minimum of one month's worth of PS Plus, you can get the game at a discount, $7.99.

02:12:24.548 --> 02:12:28.011
[SPEAKER_09]: So I give the PSN version an ever so slight edge, if only for that reason.

02:12:28.703 --> 02:12:30.203
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, and you're totally a Sony fanboy.

02:12:30.243 --> 02:12:31.004
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't even try to deny it.

02:12:31.844 --> 02:12:33.304
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but pricing is a good point.

02:12:33.984 --> 02:12:37.405
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for reading this email, and sorry to DarkSakura for sending this wall of text.

02:12:37.725 --> 02:12:39.406
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to be thorough with my review.

02:12:39.726 --> 02:12:43.587
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be so thankful she's not reading emails this week, because the whole space thing, she would have screamed.

02:12:46.127 --> 02:12:46.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Use your space!

02:12:47.428 --> 02:12:47.828
[SPEAKER_05]: Space.

02:12:48.188 --> 02:12:48.508
[SPEAKER_05]: Space.

02:12:48.888 --> 02:12:49.548
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the best at space.

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:50.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Space.

02:12:52.289 --> 02:12:53.969
[SPEAKER_05]: We were doing that on Space Mountain, by the way.

02:12:54.289 --> 02:12:57.590
[SPEAKER_09]: He liked magic so much that the space bar got stuck.

02:12:58.081 --> 02:12:59.542
[SPEAKER_05]: We were doing that on Space Mountain, remember?

02:13:00.162 --> 02:13:00.882
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, I remember that.

02:13:01.802 --> 02:13:02.703
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the best at space.

02:13:03.123 --> 02:13:04.183
[SPEAKER_05]: So much space, gotta see it all.

02:13:06.064 --> 02:13:07.184
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we did it on Star Tours.

02:13:08.445 --> 02:13:08.625
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:13:09.545 --> 02:13:10.685
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, is an awesome ride.

02:13:11.706 --> 02:13:13.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a lot better now that they've fixed it?

02:13:14.887 --> 02:13:18.588
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the old one was charming, but it is definitely modern now.

02:13:18.708 --> 02:13:19.888
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot smoother.

02:13:20.349 --> 02:13:24.330
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just, what I love about the ride is it just starts right off with a bang.

02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:27.491
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, and you are on your way to whatever planet you go to.

02:13:27.779 --> 02:13:35.441
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, we looked up how many different scenes and at least with me and Dan, we've got all the beginnings.

02:13:35.461 --> 02:13:36.421
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two different beginnings.

02:13:37.321 --> 02:13:39.721
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got all but one of the second one.

02:13:39.741 --> 02:13:40.362
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get Hoth.

02:13:40.962 --> 02:13:42.402
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been to Hoth, so it's cool.

02:13:42.802 --> 02:13:43.402
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the best one.

02:13:44.002 --> 02:13:45.523
[SPEAKER_05]: We got all three of the middle scenes.

02:13:46.083 --> 02:13:49.543
[SPEAKER_05]: The third one, which is either Yoda, Ackbar, or Leia.

02:13:50.144 --> 02:13:50.704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a trap!

02:13:51.024 --> 02:13:51.304
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

02:13:51.684 --> 02:13:53.524
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we got all but the last.

02:13:54.104 --> 02:13:54.905
[SPEAKER_05]: All but Coruscant.

02:13:55.305 --> 02:13:56.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Coruscant's the worst one.

02:13:56.465 --> 02:13:56.805
[SPEAKER_09]: Naboo's...

02:13:57.345 --> 02:14:04.131
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say, riding the ride several times, I've gotten, I've seen all the last planets and I've seen all the, I've seen every planet now.

02:14:04.451 --> 02:14:08.135
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will tell you the best ones are Hoth for the first and Naboo.

02:14:08.495 --> 02:14:11.237
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, the Jar Jar Binks planet is the best, because it has the best ending.

02:14:11.398 --> 02:14:12.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was great.

02:14:12.138 --> 02:14:14.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I did like the Death Star one.

02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:15.221
[SPEAKER_09]: The Death Star one was pretty rad.

02:14:15.241 --> 02:14:16.562
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a close second.

02:14:16.682 --> 02:14:19.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Of what we got, though, my favorite was Kashyyyk, because I like Wookiees.

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:22.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

02:14:22.813 --> 02:14:26.676
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll stop nerding about Star Tours now and get to the FUs of the week.

02:14:26.756 --> 02:14:28.438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the part of the show where we rant.

02:14:28.578 --> 02:14:28.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

02:14:29.278 --> 02:14:30.019
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we can.

02:14:46.491 --> 02:14:47.472
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to being sick.

02:14:49.094 --> 02:14:50.876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like it's a contagious disease.

02:14:50.956 --> 02:14:53.499
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on my sinuses and it happens around this time of year.

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:55.921
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to go swimming today.

02:14:56.502 --> 02:14:59.965
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result, I laid down for what I intended to be an hour nap at 1030.

02:15:00.266 --> 02:15:01.787
[SPEAKER_05]: I woke up at 330.

02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:07.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Having slept through my alarm seven times, apparently I kept resetting it in my sleep.

02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:09.821
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

02:15:37.879 --> 02:15:39.280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what?

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:40.760
[SPEAKER_09]: F you.

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:41.581
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

02:15:43.761 --> 02:15:48.243
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to fighting with my console and try to get it to work on my computer right now.

02:15:49.084 --> 02:16:03.569
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a while because it was set to 1080i and it really needed to be 480p and I even did the thing to reset the graphics, you know, the quick little hold Y and the right trigger and restart your console, but it just didn't want to work.

02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:05.110
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the work done.

02:16:07.136 --> 02:16:36.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com Some follow-ups to some things from the email bag Xenacore is in chat saying To add to the email, you can get the Magic game for free If your PSN Plus is active You can play it for free as long as the PlayStation Plus is still on your account Nice, so if you want to go see If Spazinator is correct in his Magic review You can use your 30-day trial that most people are on right now And check it out, it's pretty cool I like that

02:16:37.768 --> 02:16:46.437
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on to a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:16:46.657 --> 02:16:47.578
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to that in just a moment.

02:16:48.118 --> 02:16:50.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, though, first, a couple more stories.

02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:50.400
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

02:16:50.941 --> 02:16:56.126
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, one story that's been around ever since Duke Nukem Forever was being

02:16:56.206 --> 02:16:58.608
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Duke Nukem Forever

02:17:15.542 --> 02:17:35.435
[SPEAKER_02]: and along with that Gearbox even sent him a bunch of cool swag and stuff like that so apparently he does like the game the guy that picked up the game so good for him glad that they you know took your receipt that you kept all this time

02:17:37.754 --> 02:17:42.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up that Skype line.

02:17:42.417 --> 02:17:48.880
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and unfortunately we end on a bit of a sad note tonight.

02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.943
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another game studio who apparently has closed in their doors.

02:17:53.443 --> 02:17:56.004
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Republic is the studio.

02:17:56.425 --> 02:17:58.386
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the website has disappeared.

02:17:58.446 --> 02:17:59.426
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no longer online.

02:17:59.466 --> 02:18:01.888
[SPEAKER_09]: The Tokyo offices now vacated.

02:18:02.868 --> 02:18:05.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the founder Yoshihiki Okamoto

02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:10.472
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge amounts of debt and can't be tracked down, so unfortunately it looks like they've closed.

02:18:10.492 --> 02:18:21.276
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the games that they made, Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, Folklore was another game that they made, and I believe they were the studio behind Genji Day of the Blade, if I'm not mistaking.

02:18:21.756 --> 02:18:22.736
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's right.

02:18:22.756 --> 02:18:26.338
[SPEAKER_09]: The studio, of course, infamous for the giant enemy crabs.

02:18:27.538 --> 02:18:32.021
[SPEAKER_09]: And while a lot of people are pointing and laughing at that whole thing, it's never any fun to report developers losing their jobs.

02:18:32.621 --> 02:18:35.923
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a shitty economy right now, no matter where you live.

02:18:35.943 --> 02:18:37.944
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's open up the Skype line.

02:18:38.004 --> 02:18:42.687
[SPEAKER_09]: It's open now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:43.868 --> 02:18:48.431
[SPEAKER_09]: While we wait for those calls to come in, I'm going to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories.

02:18:50.951 --> 02:18:51.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not really.

02:18:52.031 --> 02:18:54.912
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not a whole lot else that we have to report on.

02:18:55.213 --> 02:18:59.654
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to talk really quick, though, about, uh, there are some indie games that they're showing off.

02:19:00.474 --> 02:19:04.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and one of them, uh, was, was it Revolver 360?

02:19:04.736 --> 02:19:08.677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this game that's on the, uh, Xbox indie games.

02:19:09.498 --> 02:19:10.058
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um...

02:19:10.798 --> 02:19:11.518
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty awesome.

02:19:11.558 --> 02:19:14.259
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just kind of goes to show you that there's hidden gems out there.

02:19:14.279 --> 02:19:17.580
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically kind of almost like a cave-style shooter.

02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.660
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just bullet hell like crazy.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:29.883
[SPEAKER_02]: But what makes it unique is that you can rotate around in kind of this 3D sphere, so you can rotate the environment around.

02:19:29.943 --> 02:19:35.925
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, for example, you have bullets coming at you in a big line, you can actually rotate it so that they're...

02:19:37.285 --> 02:19:39.027
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still pissed off about my Yard's Revenge purchase

02:20:05.528 --> 02:20:10.132
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh gosh, I heard this game was not so great, but what happened to you?

02:20:10.932 --> 02:20:14.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the idea behind the game was solid.

02:20:15.035 --> 02:20:22.121
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just an old school corridor shooter like Lucky and Wild or anything else like that from the arcade.

02:20:22.301 --> 02:20:24.122
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's the way it felt to me when I was playing it.

02:20:24.723 --> 02:20:29.847
[SPEAKER_01]: But just certain rudimentary things that were going on slipped through the cracks.

02:20:29.867 --> 02:20:32.949
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if it really got rushed, I think is what happened to it.

02:20:33.149 --> 02:20:33.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I hate that.

02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:36.632
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate that when games are so obviously rushed.

02:20:37.333 --> 02:20:43.017
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the game is functional, but it looks like, I mean, the coders didn't finish putting the polish on everything.

02:20:43.037 --> 02:20:46.740
[SPEAKER_01]: When you first started, at least on the PC version of what I'm playing, it's not full screen.

02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:47.941
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the Windows border.

02:20:49.202 --> 02:20:53.486
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, I mean, most savvy users, you hit Alt-Enter, it will go into Windows mode.

02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:56.952
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the age of my machine, I can't put it in the DirectX 10.

02:20:57.232 --> 02:20:59.093
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if I'm looking at the right graphics.

02:21:00.634 --> 02:21:03.036
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gameplay is a bit rough.

02:21:03.396 --> 02:21:04.337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not polished.

02:21:04.377 --> 02:21:08.620
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really got rushed, which kind of disappoints me because I sort of like the new idea they're going with it.

02:21:08.936 --> 02:21:13.158
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you feel about all these reimaginings of classic games?

02:21:13.178 --> 02:21:17.819
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something Atari has really done a lot of and is going to continue to do over the next year.

02:21:17.859 --> 02:21:23.521
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they've got a Centipede game coming out on 3DS, Warlords they've revisited.

02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:27.463
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really trying to bank on nostalgia redone, I guess.

02:21:27.603 --> 02:21:28.383
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think about that?

02:21:29.003 --> 02:21:32.705
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought into that initially when they're doing that with the Xbox Live Arcade.

02:21:32.745 --> 02:21:33.785
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of those games.

02:21:33.925 --> 02:21:41.968
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, sadly, all the multiplayer stuff, hardly anybody plays them, even when they first came out, plays a multiplayer, which kind of disappointed me.

02:21:42.008 --> 02:21:46.390
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really looking forward to like Tron Deadly Disc multiplayer and it's not happening.

02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:48.511
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of upsetting.

02:21:48.551 --> 02:21:51.532
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as they add enough to the game to where...

02:21:52.242 --> 02:21:55.564
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're charging $10, it feels justified to me, then it's fine.

02:21:55.624 --> 02:21:57.125
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to really polish it up.

02:21:57.486 --> 02:22:03.470
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like what they did with Yard's Revenge, they changed the whole dynamic and used it as inspiration for their game.

02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:05.431
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool with that, but just make sure you finish it.

02:22:06.452 --> 02:22:07.252
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me finished stuff.

02:22:07.312 --> 02:22:07.853
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I want.

02:22:08.153 --> 02:22:09.134
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kind of tough.

02:22:09.154 --> 02:22:13.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yard's Revenge was really easily one of the top three Atari 2600 games they ever released.

02:22:14.577 --> 02:22:17.359
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to kind of take a classic and just rush it?

02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:18.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that hurts.

02:22:19.301 --> 02:22:19.481
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

02:22:20.822 --> 02:22:23.305
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even that the game was badly designed.

02:22:23.366 --> 02:22:25.128
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the interface.

02:22:25.208 --> 02:22:31.276
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like normally when you're doing typesetting or whatever, you leave the text up on the screen long enough to where you can read it twice.

02:22:32.178 --> 02:22:36.083
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a speed reader, you might just catch everything and be able to understand what you read.

02:22:37.464 --> 02:22:38.625
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that quick on screen.

02:22:38.725 --> 02:22:41.546
[SPEAKER_01]: Even during the game, there's no speech.

02:22:41.966 --> 02:22:43.907
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's in a chat bubble over on the corner.

02:22:44.167 --> 02:22:45.428
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not looking there at all.

02:22:45.748 --> 02:22:48.449
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have no idea what the characters are saying to each other.

02:22:48.549 --> 02:22:49.889
[SPEAKER_01]: I barely understood what was going on.

02:22:49.929 --> 02:22:55.151
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks to me reading lots of fan-subbed anime and stuff, I'm used to looking at subtitles.

02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:57.112
[SPEAKER_01]: So I managed to catch everything.

02:22:57.132 --> 02:22:59.853
[SPEAKER_09]: What other games have you been playing lately?

02:22:59.893 --> 02:23:00.874
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to throw out there?

02:23:02.875 --> 02:23:05.736
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mainly doing a lot of anime watching.

02:23:06.836 --> 02:23:12.758
[SPEAKER_01]: The overseas stuff, the X-Men stuff, and the Green Lantern release that just came out recently, the animated version.

02:23:13.539 --> 02:23:16.380
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Green Lantern, did you hear the news today?

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.040
[SPEAKER_09]: The new movie...

02:23:18.261 --> 02:23:31.209
[SPEAKER_09]: It made $53 million, which to me sounds like a lot of money, but apparently considering the budget and the marketing, apparently they are calling that the very, very low end of expectations that doesn't bode well for a sequel later on.

02:23:31.890 --> 02:23:34.852
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they were initially predicting they'd get around $70, $75.

02:23:36.909 --> 02:23:39.531
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking that number's right around where Thor was.

02:23:39.731 --> 02:23:45.036
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, funny enough, the story I'd read referenced the Thor opening, and it did open below Thor.

02:23:45.396 --> 02:23:51.061
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you consider that, I guess they said, which I found weird, the Green Lantern was more well-known than Thor.

02:23:51.081 --> 02:23:53.683
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was, again, the source that I read, whatever.

02:23:53.763 --> 02:23:58.227
[SPEAKER_09]: But you could say that the actor in Thor was an unknown, whereas Ryan Reynolds, people know him.

02:23:58.287 --> 02:23:59.268
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was kind of an ouch.

02:23:59.915 --> 02:24:03.159
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's because everybody knew he'd be better as a Ryle Rayner.

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:06.724
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, excuse me, I get my lantern screwed up here.

02:24:07.125 --> 02:24:08.547
[SPEAKER_01]: He's playing the wrong lantern, in other words.

02:24:08.707 --> 02:24:09.107
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew it.

02:24:09.348 --> 02:24:10.609
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the problem.

02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:12.872
[SPEAKER_05]: More proof that Deadpool should have come out already.

02:24:14.074 --> 02:24:15.997
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know he'd be perfect for Deadpool.

02:24:16.437 --> 02:24:17.237
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we knew that.

02:24:17.918 --> 02:24:18.518
[SPEAKER_01]: We geeks know.

02:24:18.958 --> 02:24:22.019
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to let you go, Zena.

02:24:22.039 --> 02:24:24.940
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we can take more calls, but thanks for the review on yours, Revenge.

02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.060
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem, man.

02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:26.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it easy.

02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:27.801
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

02:24:27.821 --> 02:24:29.661
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:24:29.742 --> 02:24:31.522
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this tonight.

02:24:31.662 --> 02:24:35.463
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like we're getting reviews from everybody on games I haven't been able to touch.

02:24:35.684 --> 02:24:36.404
[SPEAKER_09]: This is pretty nice.

02:24:36.684 --> 02:24:38.444
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see if we get another one.

02:24:38.464 --> 02:24:38.685
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:24:40.465 --> 02:24:42.446
[SPEAKER_09]: or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:42.807 --> 02:24:46.449
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask you this, DarkSakura, while we wait for some calls and Loki left the room for a minute.

02:24:46.689 --> 02:24:51.612
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we were talking about nostalgia on that last call in a game like Yars' Revenge that they've reimagined.

02:24:53.773 --> 02:24:56.615
[SPEAKER_09]: You really still kind of live in the nostalgia world a little bit.

02:24:56.855 --> 02:25:00.478
[SPEAKER_09]: You really probably play more retro games than you do current games.

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:03.580
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's not hidden by your gaming weeks and so forth.

02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:05.841
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you feel about a lot of these reimaginings?

02:25:08.416 --> 02:25:16.105
[SPEAKER_05]: I really... It's kind of weird for me because if they're done faithfully, then I have no problem with it.

02:25:16.185 --> 02:25:20.570
[SPEAKER_05]: If they take the basic concept and evolve it, I'm really excited by that.

02:25:21.251 --> 02:25:24.435
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's just, you know...

02:25:26.337 --> 02:25:30.680
[SPEAKER_05]: My concept of butchering a game is pretty personal.

02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:32.001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be different for everybody.

02:25:33.001 --> 02:25:38.745
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they just take it and completely ruin aspects of it that I thought were great, then no.

02:25:38.845 --> 02:25:41.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if they took the Guardian Legend and filled it full of blood.

02:25:42.868 --> 02:25:43.008
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

02:25:43.348 --> 02:25:45.850
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to the phones because we've got more calls coming in.

02:25:45.890 --> 02:25:46.931
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:25:46.951 --> 02:25:47.291
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:25:49.077 --> 02:25:49.938
[SPEAKER_09]: This is TakeiQ.

02:25:50.378 --> 02:25:51.218
[SPEAKER_06]: TakeiQ!

02:25:51.439 --> 02:25:52.099
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.321
[SPEAKER_06]: This is more of like a Loki question.

02:25:55.481 --> 02:25:55.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:25:55.761 --> 02:25:59.323
[SPEAKER_06]: Any tips on upgrading a PS3 Slims hard drive?

02:26:00.364 --> 02:26:00.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, did you hear that?

02:26:01.124 --> 02:26:03.246
[SPEAKER_09]: Any tips on upgrading a PS3 Slims hard drive?

02:26:03.646 --> 02:26:09.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you back up everything to something else first, and then it's pretty easy.

02:26:09.570 --> 02:26:12.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you just pop it in there and then format it.

02:26:13.272 --> 02:26:16.234
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have to make sure it's formatted FAT32, I think, though.

02:26:19.026 --> 02:26:20.408
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any online resources?

02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:22.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search online.

02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:27.754
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a thing from HP that you can format anything, FAT32.

02:26:27.895 --> 02:26:30.637
[SPEAKER_02]: I did my external laptop.

02:26:30.717 --> 02:26:31.358
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need that.

02:26:31.378 --> 02:26:32.419
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is run it through DOS.

02:26:34.507 --> 02:26:36.168
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you expanding the hard drive on your PS3 for?

02:26:36.268 --> 02:26:37.349
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you trying to fit more porn?

02:26:38.249 --> 02:26:43.293
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I feel like I'm running out of space on my 120 that came with it.

02:26:43.653 --> 02:26:46.515
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have an 80 gig and I feel like I'm starting to run out of space too.

02:26:46.555 --> 02:26:53.899
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of it is because now, thanks to the free games, I'm installing these 5, 6 gigabyte games on the drive.

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:56.541
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I'm kind of with you.

02:26:56.581 --> 02:26:57.822
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to expand my drive too.

02:26:58.082 --> 02:27:01.064
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you download a lot of movies on PlayStation Marketplace or is it all like gameplay?

02:27:01.624 --> 02:27:08.971
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm mostly using Vudu now for the streaming since I don't like downloading from the PSN store because it takes a while.

02:27:09.291 --> 02:27:12.213
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you like Vudu as compared to Hulu and Netflix?

02:27:12.254 --> 02:27:14.656
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't usually hear that one, but I'm curious to know more about it.

02:27:14.676 --> 02:27:16.077
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more for the new releases.

02:27:16.517 --> 02:27:18.799
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Walmart for new releases.

02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:26.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they have a sale for $0.99 for a more recent movie I can watch that Netflix doesn't have.

02:27:26.666 --> 02:27:26.826
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

02:27:27.850 --> 02:27:28.671
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, very cool.

02:27:28.711 --> 02:27:31.934
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the new releases, you can just stream it instead of downloading it.

02:27:32.735 --> 02:27:37.980
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, download takes like maybe two hours, three hours, or streaming, you just, it's there.

02:27:38.618 --> 02:27:39.659
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you would love Desperate Housewives

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:06.555
[SPEAKER_09]: because I like that campy type of stuff, and I guess that show's very campy, but never seen an episode.

02:28:07.276 --> 02:28:07.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunday nights.

02:28:08.116 --> 02:28:09.697
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, if it's on Sunday nights, I've never watched it.

02:28:10.738 --> 02:28:12.479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have another thing, another question, too.

02:28:12.579 --> 02:28:14.780
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:18.702
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to, like, download the firmware update when you're upgrading the hard drive?

02:28:18.922 --> 02:28:21.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I've read, like, articles on it that you have to.

02:28:21.924 --> 02:28:24.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki left the room for a minute, so I'm not sure because I haven't changed mine.

02:28:24.966 --> 02:28:25.306
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki!

02:28:28.584 --> 02:28:29.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Firmware update.

02:28:29.424 --> 02:28:31.925
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have to do a firmware update when you change those drives?

02:28:36.086 --> 02:28:42.168
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you may have to redo your current firmware update to change them over.

02:28:42.988 --> 02:28:49.790
[SPEAKER_02]: It says that you have to do it again and it's supposed to not work afterwards but I went from my 20 to my 500.

02:28:51.090 --> 02:28:52.291
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I didn't go back to my 20.

02:28:52.531 --> 02:28:54.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about going back to my 20 but I never did.

02:28:54.691 --> 02:28:56.212
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you use a USB drive with those?

02:28:56.252 --> 02:28:57.312
[SPEAKER_09]: This might be a dumb question but

02:28:57.591 --> 02:28:59.292
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, but you can't store games to it.

02:28:59.852 --> 02:28:59.952
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

02:29:00.913 --> 02:29:01.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:29:01.233 --> 02:29:02.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do movies?

02:29:02.174 --> 02:29:03.335
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put movies on there.

02:29:03.435 --> 02:29:05.256
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put pictures, music.

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:06.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

02:29:07.357 --> 02:29:09.198
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to have certain directories and stuff.

02:29:09.799 --> 02:29:10.059
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:29:10.639 --> 02:29:10.919
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:29:10.959 --> 02:29:13.301
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any other thoughts for us tonight before we let you go?

02:29:14.501 --> 02:29:15.342
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye SOCOM.

02:29:17.263 --> 02:29:18.424
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you say bye-bye SOCOM?

02:29:19.244 --> 02:29:19.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't like the game.

02:29:20.205 --> 02:29:23.207
[SPEAKER_06]: I rented it and didn't like the controls that you can't change it.

02:29:24.187 --> 02:29:25.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I hate that.

02:29:25.368 --> 02:29:28.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Customizability should be like one of the first easy things to think about.

02:29:29.113 --> 02:29:30.154
[SPEAKER_06]: How irritating.

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:33.017
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, I guess, Call of Duty player.

02:29:33.478 --> 02:29:37.622
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have the triggers to fire and iron sightsees.

02:29:38.683 --> 02:29:41.707
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's worth doing it on the R&L buttons instead of the triggers.

02:29:43.072 --> 02:29:45.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, we're going to let you go and we get some more calls.

02:29:45.996 --> 02:29:47.818
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for your call and good luck with the PS3 upgrade.

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:48.779
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:50.562
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, later.

02:29:50.582 --> 02:29:53.005
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.

02:29:53.025 --> 02:29:54.907
[SPEAKER_09]: We can probably fit one more call in tonight.

02:29:55.448 --> 02:29:58.552
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we'll see if we get any other calls.

02:29:58.793 --> 02:30:00.174
[SPEAKER_09]: We're out of last minute stories, right?

02:30:01.055 --> 02:30:01.276
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

02:30:04.664 --> 02:30:05.584
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if anybody calls.

02:30:05.625 --> 02:30:06.085
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there it is.

02:30:06.165 --> 02:30:06.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Lighten up.

02:30:06.906 --> 02:30:10.849
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always that little delay between when we say something and when it goes out over the air.

02:30:11.249 --> 02:30:12.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:30:12.130 --> 02:30:12.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:14.351
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one and only Ranma.

02:30:14.451 --> 02:30:15.012
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

02:30:15.092 --> 02:30:19.175
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew you'd get through eventually ever since you said in chat that I missed your Twitter topic.

02:30:19.195 --> 02:30:19.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

02:30:20.316 --> 02:30:20.736
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

02:30:20.796 --> 02:30:21.377
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgive you.

02:30:21.597 --> 02:30:27.221
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't reading chronologically this week because we got a few that I wanted to make sure I mentioned before today.

02:30:27.682 --> 02:30:28.983
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I screwed up.

02:30:29.083 --> 02:30:29.443
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

02:30:30.043 --> 02:30:30.584
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

02:30:31.324 --> 02:30:31.865
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

02:30:33.223 --> 02:30:34.864
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke Nukem Forever.

02:30:35.885 --> 02:30:36.345
[SPEAKER_09]: What about it?

02:30:37.606 --> 02:30:38.967
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a guilty pleasure game.

02:30:39.247 --> 02:30:41.849
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, the game is so bad, it's just good.

02:30:42.149 --> 02:30:43.730
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like the showgirls of video games?

02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:45.831
[SPEAKER_10]: Something along those lines, yes.

02:30:47.192 --> 02:30:51.975
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about how this game is so bad, it's good.

02:30:52.015 --> 02:30:55.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Give an example of something in the game that happens where you're like, oh my god, this is terrible and I love it.

02:30:56.819 --> 02:31:01.862
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, if you remember from the demo, there are two twins in the game.

02:31:02.912 --> 02:31:04.814
[SPEAKER_10]: They're called the Wholesome Twins.

02:31:06.575 --> 02:31:07.616
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary and Kate.

02:31:10.779 --> 02:31:12.681
[SPEAKER_09]: So no secret what that's parodying, huh?

02:31:13.342 --> 02:31:14.142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:31:14.283 --> 02:31:18.607
[SPEAKER_10]: And they show a video clip of them doing a video to a song called Full House.

02:31:19.147 --> 02:31:19.868
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's terrible.

02:31:21.102 --> 02:31:49.688
[SPEAKER_09]: very terrible I heard something about they die horribly later on like spoilers OMG but I don't know I'm at the point where the aliens kidnap them and Duke's all pissed the fuck off about it I hear it's not a pretty ending like it actually has some people kind of saying that that's where that is exactly where the game crosses the line just so you know I won't ruin it for you but you don't kill the hot chicks you don't do that I hear the ending is like wow but we'll see

02:31:51.069 --> 02:31:54.210
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think about these websites that are giving the game a zero?

02:31:55.691 --> 02:32:04.316
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the sites that are giving the game a zero are coming from people who did not grow up playing the original Duke Nukem 3D.

02:32:04.756 --> 02:32:09.339
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like these are people that are younger than me who don't know their ass from a hole in the wall.

02:32:10.119 --> 02:32:16.583
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, they're counting on the fact that Gearbox is working on it, so they expected something big like Borderlands.

02:32:17.043 --> 02:32:21.027
[SPEAKER_10]: As I said before, all Gearbox said that they were going to do was put the game out.

02:32:21.507 --> 02:32:23.609
[SPEAKER_10]: They never said what they were going to do exactly.

02:32:24.129 --> 02:32:28.933
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the wait of 12 plus years is like, okay, let's see what you got.

02:32:29.974 --> 02:32:32.957
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like they were just looking for a reason to just blast the game.

02:32:33.237 --> 02:32:51.128
[SPEAKER_00]: here comes Dan the man wants to say something on this topic yeah it should be on just make sure oh god geez it makes everybody wonder why they weren't putting it out oh because it sucked nuts and they knew it they were like holy fucking god we can't fix it it's terrible and there you go that's what y'all fucking get

02:32:51.690 --> 02:33:19.829
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god Fucking even Gearbox couldn't polish that turd And Gearbox rules Great, Duke Duke comes over Fucking finish the next Brothers in Arms Or whatever the fuck you're doing And get to work on Borderlands 2 But Rama says Rama's review of the game is that This game is so bad, it's good I hope to find out When I'm done with the game I will ship it overnight to you so you can play it You don't have to, I'm getting a copy Oh, there you go

02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:26.335
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in the chat room is making a request that that should be the next game I have my mom watch me play.

02:33:26.715 --> 02:33:27.095
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

02:33:27.636 --> 02:33:28.176
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

02:33:29.657 --> 02:33:31.259
[SPEAKER_09]: We already got our Mortal Kombat reactions.

02:33:33.581 --> 02:33:34.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that.

02:33:34.321 --> 02:33:34.982
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, I could.

02:33:36.103 --> 02:33:38.745
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well anything else you've been playing lately you want to share real quick?

02:33:40.605 --> 02:33:45.690
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I really, well, I've been playing games on my phone really, so, you know, yeah.

02:33:45.730 --> 02:33:46.611
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, do you have an iPhone?

02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:48.612
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have an Android phone.

02:33:48.833 --> 02:33:49.113
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

02:33:49.493 --> 02:33:54.958
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to ask if you've been playing these Gameloft games and if they're as horrible of a ripoff as everyone says they are.

02:33:55.418 --> 02:34:04.907
[SPEAKER_10]: The only corporate game, portable minigame I've been playing is Words with Friends, but due to my job, I just keep forgetting to log in and catch up with playing, you know?

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:34.669
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I just found this knockoff of a pipe dream game I find myself playing all the damn time Alright, well Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for calling Oh wait, you didn't go to Nintendo World today That surprises me Number one, I didn't even know about it and number two, I am so backlogged from Anime Next, I've just been sitting here working on videos and uploading them all day, that's all I've been doing is just post-con work I was just saying, I was looking at JV Mom Pictures and Black Luigi was nowhere to be found

02:34:35.089 --> 02:34:39.131
[SPEAKER_10]: See, now, I have a phone to pick with JV Monk because he has my number.

02:34:39.292 --> 02:34:41.933
[SPEAKER_10]: He could have texted a brother and said this was going on.

02:34:42.734 --> 02:34:51.679
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't have to wear black Luigi, but I sure as hell have a black Zelda outfit I could have easily thrown together and shown the fuck up with.

02:34:52.617 --> 02:34:52.797
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

02:35:10.817 --> 02:35:13.358
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say Anime Boston, but fuck Anime Boston.

02:35:13.558 --> 02:35:15.899
[SPEAKER_10]: PAX East, I may be walking around in size.

02:35:15.999 --> 02:35:18.520
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to see the chocobo in your hair.

02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:25.062
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how many people want to make the wig with the chocobo in it?

02:35:25.422 --> 02:35:29.403
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, first person that does it, gets it to me first, is the winner.

02:35:29.683 --> 02:35:30.464
[SPEAKER_10]: Simple as that.

02:35:31.404 --> 02:35:34.705
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what, if I can lose enough weight, I'll be Snow.

02:35:35.765 --> 02:35:37.046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be the guy that everybody hates.

02:35:37.529 --> 02:35:40.251
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no.

02:35:40.451 --> 02:35:42.293
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need you as snow.

02:35:43.314 --> 02:35:44.775
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't have that.

02:35:44.875 --> 02:35:46.096
[SPEAKER_09]: What, you want me to be vanilla?

02:35:47.297 --> 02:35:48.358
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to be lightning.

02:35:49.298 --> 02:35:54.823
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Rob, you're fabulous enough to pull it off, so why the fuck not?

02:35:57.425 --> 02:35:58.386
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, I think.

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Even better, I got one better before I go.

02:36:01.921 --> 02:36:07.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Since Salacious Pop loves panty and stocking, the two of you should do panty and stocking.

02:36:07.523 --> 02:36:14.045
[SPEAKER_10]: You should wear a red zoot suit and have a gun, and he should wear a black suit with the matching wig and have a sword.

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:16.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Only if you go as Garterbelt.

02:36:16.206 --> 02:36:20.207
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not even here, and I can just tell you he's side-eyeing you so hard right now.

02:36:20.811 --> 02:36:33.568
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will show up as Gardabelt, dammit Alright, we're gonna let you go We'll have Loki show up as Chuck Chuck, Chuck, Chuck I keep saying we're gonna let you go, but then we get questions from chat Frisbee says, weren't you gonna boycott Nintendo?

02:36:34.522 --> 02:36:36.583
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not yet, okay?

02:36:36.883 --> 02:36:37.763
[SPEAKER_10]: I am holding out.

02:36:38.063 --> 02:36:39.623
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm holding out.

02:36:39.643 --> 02:36:42.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo 3DS, Mario Kart 3DS.

02:36:42.824 --> 02:36:45.685
[SPEAKER_10]: I am a whore for Mario Kart, okay?

02:36:45.925 --> 02:36:46.845
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm waiting for.

02:36:46.925 --> 02:36:49.726
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee, we all said that night he announced it here on the show.

02:36:49.766 --> 02:36:51.107
[SPEAKER_09]: We all said, I give it a week.

02:36:51.467 --> 02:36:53.267
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all said that, and sure enough.

02:36:53.747 --> 02:36:55.368
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn you all!

02:36:55.768 --> 02:36:57.208
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care, Rama.

[SPEAKER_09]: Always fun to talk to Ranma here on the show.

02:37:02.511 --> 02:37:03.552
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to close the Skype line.

02:37:22.149 --> 02:37:22.410
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

[SPEAKER_09]: That's that.

02:37:24.063 --> 02:37:26.244
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.

02:37:26.644 --> 02:37:28.425
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and listening.

02:37:29.286 --> 02:37:31.968
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say, of course, before we go, get everybody's final thought.

02:37:32.268 --> 02:37:34.330

[SPEAKER_09]: Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:43.136 --> 02:37:45.777
[SPEAKER_09]: We would really appreciate it because we're word of mouth.

02:37:45.897 --> 02:37:48.239
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't get PR firms that work with it.

02:37:48.259 --> 02:37:51.001
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a couple small ones that do, and we are grateful for that.

02:37:51.021 --> 02:37:52.602
[SPEAKER_09]: But none of the big, big companies work with it.

[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

02:38:29.774 --> 02:38:30.895
[SPEAKER_09]: You're sick, you can't do it.

02:38:34.743 --> 02:38:35.864
[SPEAKER_09]: And off goes your mic.

02:38:36.004 --> 02:38:36.224
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:38:38.005 --> 02:38:38.325

[SPEAKER_09]: I told you I'd get it.

02:38:40.187 --> 02:38:42.128
[SPEAKER_09]: That does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_09]: We will be back next week to do it all over again with the ninth birthday show.

02:38:46.991 --> 02:38:51.854
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like we are going to have a guest here in studio, someone that's been on the show before but who we always like having on the show.

02:38:52.435 --> 02:38:58.098
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a lot about reminiscing in the past next week and just talking about the good old days back in my day.

02:38:58.379 --> 02:38:58.799
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

02:38:58.919 --> 02:39:03.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this week DarkSakura and I will go to RVGL just for shits and giggles.

02:39:03.642 --> 02:39:04.902
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we'd be going there to cry.

02:39:05.103 --> 02:39:05.403
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:39:05.743 --> 02:39:06.523
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night, everybody.

02:39:06.543 --> 02:39:08.003
