00:00.000 --> 00:18.320
Tonight, June 19th, 2011, more details emerge on the Wii U.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.800
A Facebook game developer sues an alleged copycat, and a Kinect software development

00:22.800 --> 00:31.560
kit for Windows is released.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.800
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.800 --> 00:39.040
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.360
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the

00:42.360 --> 00:45.080
one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
Hi.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
How are you?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.080
I'm unwell.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.080
What's wrong?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
Sinuses.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Aww.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
I'm unwell.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
I'm unwell.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.200
Everybody say hello to Dark Sakura, also known as Manuel.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.000
And the smartass over there in the corner, the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.200
I'm doing fine.

01:05.200 --> 01:11.080
I'm eating the large, unhealthy sandwich, as is tradition.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.120
What is this unhealthy sandwich that you're eating?

01:13.120 --> 01:18.760
It's a grinder from our very, very discounted food chain, Winco.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.840
But it's basically an Italian sandwich on a loaf of garlic bread.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
It's so good.

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
And it's called a grinder?

01:24.840 --> 01:26.840
It's called a grinder.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.840
On the iPhone, a grinder, never mind.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.240
Anyhow, if you want to join us, the ever-present fourth guest on our show is the chat room.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.800
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us in our chat room and say hello, because

01:38.800 --> 01:44.000
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.880
www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Loki is holding his sandwich

01:49.880 --> 01:56.240
up in the air like it's a victory pose, like he's He-Man or something, or the little Zelda

01:56.240 --> 01:57.240
noise.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.240
Anyhow.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.240
All right.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.480
So, Loki, you didn't get to join us for the second E3 show, obviously.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.560
That was the last thing that was on the feed, and we were off on Sunday, because we had

02:06.560 --> 02:09.320
done the other E3 shows Tuesday and Wednesday.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.800
You were here Wednesday when we talked about things like Skyrim, and I believe that was

02:13.800 --> 02:17.680
the day that Miklotov had waited in line to play the Vita, and so forth.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.640
Any kind of closing thoughts from you for E3, since you didn't get your chance before

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
Loki?

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
Um.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.640
Not for John Spodley.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.240
The play-throw's awesome, I mean.

02:29.240 --> 02:37.080
No, I don't know, like, the PlayStation Vita, I don't really care for.

02:37.080 --> 02:43.280
I mean, there's a lot of features to it, which is kind of cool, but I just don't know if

02:43.280 --> 02:44.760
I really care about it too much.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.400
I mean, there's not any games that jump out and say, oh my god, I gotta own that.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.880
Like, you know what, Uncharted, see, I'm not a fan of the Uncharted series.

02:52.880 --> 02:58.440
Not that it's a bad series, but I just never played them, and don't really want to play

02:58.440 --> 02:59.440
them.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.440
There's not enough time to play everything.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
Exactly.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.440
This isn't our day job, so.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.440
It's all right.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.600
I mean, it looks good.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.320
I was unaware, now I don't remember the whole entire feature list, but I guess those things

03:09.320 --> 03:11.240
have GPS built into them.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.680
Yeah, I seem to remember that from the original unveiling, yeah.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.720
I just saw that because I'm setting up the items for it, and they've got, like, some

03:18.720 --> 03:20.040
games.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.400
It breaks it down, you know how in the back of those PlayStation boxes, like, okay, you

03:23.400 --> 03:28.840
need such and such space for storage, it's one player, it's online, it's blah blah blah.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.120
Well, they actually break it down to what features of the Vita are actually used.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.060
Like, this uses the front touch, this uses the back touch, the tilt controls, the multi-touch

03:38.060 --> 03:40.800
on things, sliding your finger back, I mean.

03:40.800 --> 03:46.160
So on a one to ten on the gimmick meter, this game rates a six or a seven.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
Yeah, I'm sure.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.840
Especially those launch games will make heavy use of gimmicks.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.920
I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of gimmicky stuff on there, but I think it's got potential

03:52.920 --> 03:58.500
as far as, you know, it's nice that that stuff is on there, just please, publishers, don't

03:58.500 --> 04:01.400
try to, you know, just make a bunch of gimmicks.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.960
Use it if it makes sense.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
Exactly.

04:03.960 --> 04:09.760
I mean, don't necessarily have to use the touch screen for stuff you don't, you know,

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
need to use it for.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.120
I mean, buttons work just as well, I don't know.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.320
Let me go to this comment from chatroom at chat.orangelaungeready.com where, by the way,

04:17.320 --> 04:20.480
there's a lot of praise going on for your sandwich that sounds really good.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
It is really good.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.960
You get a picture of that.

04:22.960 --> 04:23.960
That just looks like...

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
That's a half.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
That's half of the sandwich.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.400
That is a heart attack that you're eating.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
That's half a sandwich.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
Alright, anyhow.

04:29.400 --> 04:34.160
So, going to chatroom, BlackWolf starts us off tonight, and this is a quote I've heard

04:34.160 --> 04:37.180
him say several times, in fact on his own show, and I don't remember if he said it

04:37.180 --> 04:41.760
on our E3 or whatever, but BlackWolf starts us off tonight saying, Saints Row is the video

04:41.760 --> 04:45.280
game version of what goes on in Loki's head.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.280
Exactly.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.320
Pretty much.

04:48.320 --> 04:54.840
Saints Row is basically, cause, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV really was kind of a step

04:54.840 --> 04:58.680
away from the direction of Grand Theft Auto was kind of going.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.080
San Andreas was just a really crazy game.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.680
I mean, you could do so much in there.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.680
You could do pretty much anything.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.360
I mean, you had girlfriends you could do, you could go ride a bicycle, you can do base

05:07.360 --> 05:13.160
jumping, you know, swim in the ocean, fly jets, you know, just wander around the desert,

05:13.160 --> 05:15.080
go gamble, whatever.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.960
And then, Rockstar's like, hey, you know what, we're going to make the game more realistic.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.640
So we're taking out all the fun stuff, like the tanks, the flamethrowers, the miniguns.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
We're taking that all out.

05:25.640 --> 05:31.840
We're just going to make this game more realistic, and everyone was kind of like, eh, okay.

05:31.840 --> 05:36.080
And then, like, as stuff, their expansions came out, you know, they started kind of bringing

05:36.080 --> 05:41.480
that over the top stuff back, but it's still nothing to what San Andreas was, whereas Saints

05:41.480 --> 05:45.840
Row was kind of crazy at the beginning, and then the second game was even crazier.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.640
The third game is just, they basically, the developer was even, you know, quoted saying

05:50.640 --> 05:57.400
before, you know, Saints Row, the, you know, activities and stuff were kind of over the

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
top.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.000
Saints Row the third were making everything over the top.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.320
Every single situation that you're in, every single battle that you're, you know, fighting,

06:05.320 --> 06:08.600
you know, the story, everything is going to be ridiculous, just over the top.

06:08.600 --> 06:13.440
You're going to be telling yourself, I can't believe I'm doing this right now.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.760
And just even watching the gameplay videos, and I've linked a ton of them on Twitter,

06:17.760 --> 06:21.000
it's just, it's awesome.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.640
The only disappointment for me is the lack of multiplayer.

06:24.640 --> 06:30.560
I mean, there's two player co-op in the single player campaign, but I really wish there was

06:30.560 --> 06:31.560
like a death match or something.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.760
Are you worried at all about this?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.640
Because this notoriously happens at E3.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.560
You know, we've been doing a show for nine years now, and I think out of those nine years

06:38.560 --> 06:40.880
we've gone to like five or six E3s.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.120
So out of those E3s, we tend to come out of there really liking one game, and then sometimes

06:46.120 --> 06:48.280
that game will come out and it sucks.

06:48.280 --> 06:52.840
My case in point, Nintendogs, I was so excited for Nintendogs, when it came out and it was

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
over in 15 minutes.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.320
Are you worried that's what's going to happen?

06:55.320 --> 06:59.400
No, I am absolutely confident that it's going to be an awesome game, because the other games

06:59.400 --> 07:00.960
have been great.

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
And that's the thing.

07:01.960 --> 07:06.200
It's like, you know, Saints Row, when it first came out, I'm like, well, there's no Grand

07:06.200 --> 07:09.880
Theft Auto in the 360, so this will just have to kind of do, and you know what?

07:09.880 --> 07:11.680
It wasn't a Grand Theft Auto clone.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.680
I mean, it kind of started off as that, I guess, a little bit.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.520
I mean, there was a lot of stuff it imitated, but it was its own thing.

07:18.520 --> 07:24.360
And as the future games came out, it really came onto its own, and it's a really fun game.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.400
Even if you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto, you really should go play Saints Row, because

07:27.400 --> 07:29.680
it's a really fun game.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.680
Let me ask this.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.640
Of course, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that good stuff, but I'm just dying

07:33.640 --> 07:36.440
to ask this question to Loki, since we're on the topic of Saints Row the Third.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.040
Obviously, one of the big games that came out this week was Duke Nukem Forever.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.120
And although I think it's on our showroll to cover later in the show, it's no big surprise.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.200
I think a lot of you know, Duke Nukem Forever has been really razzed in the gaming press

07:48.200 --> 07:49.640
as a whole.

07:49.640 --> 07:55.600
And a lot of it has been about, you know, just how, it's almost like the sense of humor

07:55.600 --> 07:59.400
in the game is to that point where it's like the guy that's so drunk, he's getting really

07:59.400 --> 08:01.120
awkward with his humor.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.960
And a lot of people are really saying like, the humor kind of steps over a line in this

08:03.960 --> 08:04.960
game.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.160
But yet, some of those same people are really excited the way you are about Saints Row the

08:09.160 --> 08:10.160
Third.

08:10.160 --> 08:15.080
Do you think there's a discrepancy, a bit of hypocrisy going on right now in the mainstream

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
gaming press?

08:16.080 --> 08:19.640
There's not hypocrisy, it's just the way they're describing the game is a little inaccurate.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.400
Here's the problem with Duke Nukem Forever.

08:22.400 --> 08:27.720
My main two problems with it right now, and I'm not that far into the game, are one, the

08:27.720 --> 08:28.720
game looks very muddy.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.280
Like, the graphics are very brown.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.120
Yeah, I know a lot of shooters out there tend to kind of go with the brown color palette,

08:34.120 --> 08:38.640
but this looks like they had a decent looking game and then they just splat poo all over

08:38.640 --> 08:39.640
it.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.840
I mean, it's just very dark, and like, even when you're playing it in HD and stuff, it

08:43.840 --> 08:47.880
looks like you're playing it on like a really low res, you know, screen or something.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.840
It's just the colors just look very, eh.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.400
Did Duke literally splash poo on them?

08:52.400 --> 08:57.120
Because I saw in the demo you can do that now, and like, Alan was playing it and making

08:57.120 --> 09:00.360
me watch and I was like, really?

09:00.360 --> 09:01.360
Really?

09:01.360 --> 09:02.360
You can fling poo?

09:02.360 --> 09:03.360
But see, that's the problem though.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.040
Duke Nukem 3D was a very colorful game.

09:06.040 --> 09:12.280
I mean, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just over the top like bright and cheery and stuff,

09:12.280 --> 09:14.920
but I mean, come on, there's a little bit of a middle ground there.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.800
It's like they intentionally made it look like garbage, and I understand that they're

09:19.800 --> 09:25.240
trying to poke fun at shooters being all brown, but you know what?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.040
That's just not funny.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.720
It's not funny, oh, haha, all those shooters are crap, so we're gonna make our game crap

09:30.720 --> 09:31.720
too.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.720
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.720
Why would you do that?

09:33.720 --> 09:34.820
And the load time is terrible.

09:34.820 --> 09:41.540
The load time for the game is just ridiculously awful, and that just screams to me that they

09:41.540 --> 09:44.880
just really rushed their way through this game, and I kind of think that they did it.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.080
It's like they went through the motions of everything.

09:47.080 --> 09:54.060
For example, like the first two levels or so that I played through it so far, you can

09:54.060 --> 09:56.260
interact with everything, which is great.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.260
You know what?

09:57.260 --> 10:01.480
In Duke Nukem 3D, you can open doors, you can hit buttons, you can flip the light switch

10:01.480 --> 10:05.920
on and off and stuff like that, but this is like, okay, I can turn all the showers on

10:05.920 --> 10:09.000
and off, I can flush all the toilets, I can piss in all the toilets, I can pick poop out

10:09.000 --> 10:12.240
of there and throw, I can draw on a chalkboard and stuff, but that doesn't make the game

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
good.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.840
It's just like, you know, I'm walking through, oh, we gotta escape the building, the aliens

10:17.840 --> 10:21.720
are attacking, and it's like, oh, or I can play pool, and I can play pinball, and I can

10:21.720 --> 10:23.800
do this.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.800
It's kind of pointless.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.760
They spent all their time making all this stuff work when they really...

10:28.760 --> 10:33.040
It sounds like the version of what we really want to do in Sony PlayStation Home.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.040
It's like they took...

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
We would like to fling poo in Central Plaza.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.480
It's like they took a really run-down car that's just completely broken, and they put

10:39.480 --> 10:43.580
shiny rims on it, and they want to make sure those rims were extra polished, so they spent

10:43.580 --> 10:47.720
all their time polishing those rims to make them the shiniest rims you've ever seen, but

10:47.720 --> 10:50.000
the car is shit.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.760
It won't drive, because it's just a shitty car, and they rush through there, oh crap,

10:54.760 --> 10:56.760
I gotta make the car work as well.

10:56.760 --> 11:00.560
That's really the problem, and like some of the spoilers I've heard, and you know, because

11:00.560 --> 11:03.640
the first level of the game, of course, is him playing the video game, and he makes the

11:03.640 --> 11:06.040
joke, oh, well, is it any good?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.240
Well, for 13 years, it better be.

11:08.240 --> 11:12.200
Well yeah, that's great that you poked fun at the fact that it took 13 years, but then

11:12.200 --> 11:16.120
you spent, what, like a year and a half on this game, and it's terrible.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.760
Okay, I gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangemantrady.com, because we are the show where every gamer

11:19.760 --> 11:20.760
has a voice.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
Here's some voices right now.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.920
Brakeman, a game that has been delayed for 12 years was rushed?

11:24.920 --> 11:25.920
What the fuck?

11:25.920 --> 11:26.920
How did they pull that off?

11:26.920 --> 11:31.520
You see, I think it's, and I think this is obvious, I'm probably staying the obvious

11:31.520 --> 11:34.840
here, but I think it's a gross misinterpretation to say this game was in development for 12

11:34.840 --> 11:35.840
years.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
It wasn't.

11:36.840 --> 11:37.840
The idea has been kicked around for 12 years.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.280
It has really been in development for like a year and a half.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
But that's terrible, though.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.520
Maybe some art, some things on paper, but come on.

11:44.520 --> 11:49.240
But, come on, I've seen games at this company, they put out Borderlands, I mean, Borderlands

11:49.240 --> 11:50.480
was awesome.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.040
Take that damn engine and put it into Duke Nukem, that's all you need to do.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.240
Just redo the assets, and it's perfect.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.700
Salacious Pop is asking, Loki, the 360 or the PS3 console version?

12:00.700 --> 12:04.960
Because the PS3 version is allegedly a leaps and bounds better port, and the 360 one is

12:04.960 --> 12:05.960
toilet.

12:05.960 --> 12:06.960
It is the 360.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
Hmm.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.960
Okay.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.520
But I don't think that the graphics are that different.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.480
It's the color palette and load time.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.520
Scott Pilgrim in our chat says, Gearbox said that they were going to make the game and

12:15.520 --> 12:17.640
nothing about it being a spectacular game.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.560
Okay, then why even bother?

12:19.560 --> 12:23.000
Why even bother if you're gonna, oh, well, we're just gonna finish it, I mean, we're

12:23.000 --> 12:24.200
gonna do a shitty job.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.760
Why would you put your name on it, then, if that's what you're gonna do?

12:26.760 --> 12:31.540
If you're gonna just sit there and poop out a game that, you know, was half done and you're

12:31.540 --> 12:36.280
just gonna kind of patch it all together to make sure it works, why would you even bother

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
doing that?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
Oh, well, we did it for the fans.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.060
Yes, the fans really want a shitty game.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.520
That's what they've been waiting 13 years for, is a really shitty game.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.040
Let me go to this last comment from our chat room, and then we'll go to our gaming weeks.

12:46.040 --> 12:50.560
Kaijuto in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, I wanna know who thought this game was

12:50.560 --> 12:51.620
gonna be good.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.680
They delayed it 12 years for a reason.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.020
The game would have not seen the light of day if gamers weren't crying about it for

12:57.020 --> 12:58.020
all these years.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.020
No, exactly.

12:59.020 --> 13:05.160
I didn't think it was gonna be good, but it's, those are my two complaints, muddy, long load

13:05.160 --> 13:06.160
time.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.680
Disclaimer, I haven't played the game yet, so I don't have an opinion on it one way or

13:09.680 --> 13:10.680
the other.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.560
I mean, I can read the reviews, but I also know not to always trust reviews, because

13:13.560 --> 13:14.560
they're sometimes wrong.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.600
In fact, about a game that I'm gonna get into later during my gaming week, I think a lot

13:18.600 --> 13:20.460
of review sites got it wrong.

13:20.460 --> 13:26.680
But anyhow, as far as Duke Nukem Forever goes, you know, I think a big part of the reason

13:26.680 --> 13:31.920
it came out was because of its legend status that it had in the gaming community as this

13:31.920 --> 13:34.760
is the game you will never get to play.

13:34.760 --> 13:40.200
And obviously, there's a love of the original Duke Nukem 3D and maybe all the way back to

13:40.200 --> 13:43.480
the old Apogee 2D Duke Nukem with that whole crude sense of humor.

13:43.480 --> 13:48.280
I mean, obviously, it's inspired even if it maybe crosses the line, depending on who you

13:48.280 --> 13:49.280
are.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.680
Anyhow, let's talk about some other games.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.800
As we get into how is your gaming week, what are the games that you've been playing this

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
week?

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
Dark Sakura.

13:56.800 --> 14:03.000
Well, to go back to two weeks worth of gaming, I played Kix at Flynn's, and Space Paranoids,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
and Tron.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.920
Now, Space Paranoids is funny because Space Paranoids, which is an arcade game that I

14:07.920 --> 14:12.240
believe you can only play at Electronica, I think that's where the only thing is, it's

14:12.240 --> 14:17.280
sitting amongst all these 80s arcades games, and it's made to look like an 80s arcade game,

14:17.280 --> 14:18.280
but it's not.

14:18.280 --> 14:22.840
It was something that was made kind of newer, like it's running on a PC, clearly, but it's

14:22.840 --> 14:23.840
in a cabinet.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.840
Yeah.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
It's kind of interesting.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.840
Yeah.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
That's what it was for.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.800
But it makes sense that they'd put it in with Electronica, because, I mean, it was the

14:30.800 --> 14:34.320
big game when the first Tron came out, you know, in the movie.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.560
Well, and Disney's very about getting you in the experience.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.960
You know, like, when you go on Space Mountain, you are boarding a spaceship and about to

14:40.960 --> 14:42.360
go through the galaxy.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.360
Space Mountain is not a rollercoaster.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.720
If a Disney employee ever called it a rollercoaster, they'd be sacked.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.160
It's a spaceship.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
That's how it works.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.640
So when you go to Flynn's arcade, I mean, it's very much a detail thing, and because

14:52.640 --> 14:57.360
Space Paranoids was a game that Kevin Flynn, that's what he made all his money developing,

14:57.360 --> 14:58.360
right?

14:58.360 --> 15:01.080
Like, they had to make it to beat you in that experience.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.720
Well, to me, technically, Dillinger stole it from him, made all the money, and then,

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
yeah, just watched it.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
Blah, blah, blah.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
All right.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.720
Fine.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.720
This is my favorite Disney movie.

15:09.720 --> 15:14.240
Um, we, uh, crap, what else did I play?

15:14.240 --> 15:17.080
Oh, Black Wolf says you can actually play it online as well.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.720
Space Paranoids Online dot com.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.720
Thank you.

15:19.720 --> 15:23.600
Um, I played some WoW.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
I played VVVVVVV.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.600
Mm-hmm.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.940
Game's frustrating as hell.

15:26.940 --> 15:29.200
I hear it's a really well-received indie title, though.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.200
I haven't played it myself.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.200
It's fun.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.200
Yeah?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
It's fun.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.200
What do you do in that game?

15:34.200 --> 15:37.320
You don't necessarily have a jump as much as you have a reverse gravity, and so to get

15:37.320 --> 15:41.160
over traps, you have to play with gravity, either walking on the bottom or you're walking

15:41.160 --> 15:42.160
on the ceiling.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.160
That sounds kind of neat.

15:43.160 --> 15:48.760
It is, but it's frustrating and a little difficult, but it took a little bit to get used to.

15:48.760 --> 15:53.720
And um, I played some Peggle, and played some, uh, Portal.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.720
Good times.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.440
Portal 2, of course, right?

15:57.440 --> 15:58.440
Yeah, Portal 2.

15:58.440 --> 16:08.080
And then, um, we got, uh, Initial D Extreme Stage for PS3, and Dan actually has been playing

16:08.080 --> 16:13.320
a bunch of that, but I had to go in and translate a little bit for him, because I can read enough

16:13.320 --> 16:19.080
in that to get an idea of what menu is what, but it's very Japanese-intensive.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
It's pretty good, though.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.800
It only has, like, two songs in it and one story mode, so, but it's got, like, I think

16:23.800 --> 16:27.600
two extra tracks than what the arcade version has.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.400
I think the arcade version is the fourth stage game.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.920
All I can say is hooray for Reach and Free PlayStation, right?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.920
So you can do that stuff.

16:35.920 --> 16:36.920
Yeah.

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
Alright.

16:37.920 --> 16:44.560
Um, but it gave him an excuse to bring back out the, uh, the rig that he bought for Gran

16:44.560 --> 16:45.560
Turismo.

16:45.560 --> 16:51.760
And, uh, it actually works really good for, uh, the PS2 Initial D game.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.560
Just thought I would point that out.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.560
Alright.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.840
Um, and then, uh, I guess that's really about it.

17:00.840 --> 17:07.200
I know I played some other stuff, but my brain's not working, so I'm just gonna say stuff.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.080
Alright, let's go- Oh!

17:09.080 --> 17:10.080
World Cup Soccer Pinball.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.080
Hell yeah.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.080
Of course.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.080
Of course.

17:13.080 --> 17:16.720
Alright, let's go to, uh, Loki, and, uh, how was your gaming week?

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
Obviously you played some Duke Nukem.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
A little bit.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.720
Uh, yeah, a little bit of Duke Nukem.

17:21.720 --> 17:31.040
Um, pretty much just, you know, a little bit of Duke Nukem, um, a little bit of, well,

17:31.040 --> 17:36.960
lots of Grand Theft Auto, and, um, that's pretty much it, you know, I really didn't

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
play a whole lot.

17:38.960 --> 17:39.960
Alright.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.400
Not every week can be so exciting.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.240
Um, I actually kind of had one of those weeks where I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.920
The only new game I played is not new.

17:47.920 --> 17:52.640
I played, uh, Little Big Planet on the PSP, because obviously this is one of the free

17:52.640 --> 17:57.240
games that they're giving away as part of the whole Welcome Back program, so, you know,

17:57.240 --> 18:02.000
that was one of the ones I chose to get, because I loved the original on PlayStation 3, so

18:02.000 --> 18:03.320
I decided to get this one.

18:03.320 --> 18:08.080
I'm not far enough into it yet where I can really review it, um, but, you know, one of

18:08.080 --> 18:11.600
the big differences I noticed right away is that, well, obviously the graphics are scaled

18:11.600 --> 18:16.340
down a little bit because it's on the PSP and not the PS3, but it's- they capture it

18:16.340 --> 18:17.340
very faithfully.

18:17.340 --> 18:22.800
Uh, there's only two planes, um, of three dimensions, not three, like you have in the

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
PlayStation 3 version.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.440
There's just a front and a back in this one.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.800
But otherwise, all the levels so far seem to be pretty faithfully recreated.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.400
I haven't really got into the whole online stuff and the levels on there.

18:32.400 --> 18:37.500
In fact, I can't even access that yet- now- yet, um, I was starting to wonder for a minute

18:37.500 --> 18:40.680
if they're even there, but there's a planet for download levels, so I'll have to look

18:40.680 --> 18:43.520
into that a little more later on and how all that works.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.400
So, I can't really review the game, but I did play it for, eh, about an hour or so.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.160
But the game I've been spending most of my time with, I actually revisited a game that

18:51.160 --> 18:55.720
I started playing about 15 months ago, but I never finished.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.640
And I think part of it was just, at that time, I was really heavy into WoW and I wasn't really

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
playing any other games.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.520
Uh, and then I loaned my copy of it to Dark Sakura for like a year.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.340
So I just got it back when we got back from the Disneyland trip this past Sunday.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.680
And that's Final Fantasy XIII.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.400
And I have- I started over on Final Fantasy XIII because I'm one of those people that

19:14.400 --> 19:19.360
with an RPG, if I can't remember the story and where I was at, then screw it, I'm starting

19:19.360 --> 19:20.360
over.

19:20.360 --> 19:25.520
And so I started the entire game over and I have spent more time in the past week playing

19:25.520 --> 19:29.200
it than I did in its original run when I first played it.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.960
Uh, I'm already past the point where I was before.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.880
So yeah, I've been having a lot of fun with that game.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.400
And you know, that game got razzed by critics a lot when it first came out.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
It was kind of mixed.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
It just had a lot of mix.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.200
And a lot of the people didn't like it because it's very linear.

19:42.200 --> 19:47.880
And unfortunately, Final Fantasy XIII doesn't not get linear until like Chapter 10 or 11

19:47.880 --> 19:49.280
in the story.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.440
And I think that's one of the things that, you know, really bugged a lot of people is

19:52.440 --> 19:55.640
that a lot of the level design is very one path.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.300
Um, but one of the strengths of Final Fantasy XIII for me, of course, is the battle system.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.680
I love the battle system in XIII.

20:00.680 --> 20:01.680
It's one of my favorites.

20:01.680 --> 20:04.680
Like the whole paradigm shifts into the different classes.

20:04.680 --> 20:08.360
If you've never played, the battle system in XIII is like, you know, you can be a black

20:08.360 --> 20:13.360
mage one minute and then you do like a paradigm shift and suddenly you're more of a buffing

20:13.360 --> 20:14.760
or debuff mage.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.960
Like I guess that would be like a, what are those, the green mages, I think, that did

20:17.960 --> 20:22.480
a lot of that in V. And then, you know, you can switch again and you're more of like a

20:22.480 --> 20:23.480
warrior.

20:23.480 --> 20:27.000
It's pretty cool just flipping back and forth in the different battles.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I really like that.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.760
And then a lot of people bitching about the characters in the game as well.

20:31.760 --> 20:38.280
And I think, again, you know, if you stick with it, a lot of the characters don't end

20:38.280 --> 20:42.620
up so one dimensional if you play the game for more than 10 hours of gameplay.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.800
You know, some of the characters, like the kids are the ones that usually get a lot of

20:45.800 --> 20:47.820
hate, uh, Hope and Vanille.

20:47.820 --> 20:54.440
And those two characters get much more rounded out as you continue on with the game.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.760
So, you know, I think it's worth it if you stick with it.

20:56.760 --> 21:01.360
But at the same time, I also understand why if a game doesn't grab you right away, you're

21:01.360 --> 21:03.440
not so inclined to want to stick with it.

21:03.440 --> 21:08.680
I think visually, graphically, and sound-wise, there's enough to keep me entertained.

21:08.680 --> 21:14.480
I think the graphics in this game are so freaking gorgeous, like, I can't even explain.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.480
Like if you just, you just like to watch pretty things, there's plenty here to keep you entertained

21:18.480 --> 21:19.480
for a while.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.800
Uh, but I think part of the big motivator why I want to go back and play this game was

21:22.800 --> 21:28.000
just hearing about Final Fantasy XIII-2 from E3 and it sounds like in this game they have

21:28.000 --> 21:31.420
really addressed a lot of the things that people didn't like about the first game.

21:31.420 --> 21:36.160
Like one of the things I noticed right off the bat were maps, even in the little trailer,

21:36.160 --> 21:37.640
that were not linear.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.760
Maps that showed big environments and open worlds.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.840
So I have a feeling, uh, XIII-2 is really going to correct what a lot of people didn't

21:44.840 --> 21:46.240
like about XIII.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.720
But I want to be able to understand the story, so I wanted to actually just play through

21:49.720 --> 21:50.720
XIII.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.820
I mean, I could have just read spoilers, but I didn't really want to.

21:52.820 --> 21:54.000
I wanted to play it.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.360
So that's where I'm at.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.360
Haven't beat it yet.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.160
Hopefully by this time next week, we'll see.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.320
I don't even know if I'm halfway through yet though.

22:00.320 --> 22:04.000
I'm about chapter 9 or so.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.240
So anyhow, that's it for my gaming week, at least all is notable.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.160
Of course I play more WoW and things like that too.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.680
But that's all I'll mention on tonight's show.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.160
So let's move on to some housekeeping, then we'll get into the news tonight.

22:17.160 --> 22:20.360
One big thing of course I wanted to say in the housekeeping tonight was happy Father's

22:20.360 --> 22:25.120
Day to all the gamer dads out there, which would include Loki, it's your first, no it's,

22:25.120 --> 22:27.200
yeah it's your first Father's Day, right?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.720
So congratulations to you on that.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.680
So what all chores did you get to do today?

22:31.680 --> 22:33.040
What chores did you make your son do today?

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
How many diapers?

22:34.040 --> 22:39.040
I just had to watch the baby all day and take my wife out to lunch.

22:39.040 --> 22:43.120
No, so I said take my wife out to lunch.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.120
Nice.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.960
Looking at chat.orangelaunchy.com, some comments on Final Fantasy XIII.

22:47.960 --> 22:51.640
Scott Pilgrim says, but Sky, the game gives you a brief recap though.

22:51.640 --> 22:57.440
It does, and the data log is very impressive, but I don't know, I still just, I wanted to

22:57.440 --> 22:58.540
start from scratch.

22:58.540 --> 22:59.540
So I did.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.040
I figured it wouldn't take me that long to catch up, and it didn't.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.920
Anyhow, on the Father's Day topic too, of course, happy Father's Day to all the gamer

23:05.920 --> 23:10.180
dads out there, or father figures, you know, if you have someone out there that considers

23:10.180 --> 23:13.720
you their dad, then happy Father's Day to you.

23:13.720 --> 23:18.000
Meanwhile, friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchyradio, we're on Twitter

23:18.000 --> 23:24.080
as well, twitter.com slash olr, and visit our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.600
It'd be nice if we had more posts in the forums there.

23:26.600 --> 23:32.000
Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news, and we'll start off with Loki.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.280
Ah yes, news, and of course we're gonna start off talking about Wii U and some of the clarifications

23:39.280 --> 23:40.280
on things.

23:40.280 --> 23:44.460
Of course, everyone wants to know what's exactly in the console itself, because all the talk

23:44.460 --> 23:50.440
was about the controller and what the controller can do, but you know, other than some videos

23:50.440 --> 23:55.680
showing what possibly the system can do, we really didn't go into detail about the console

23:55.680 --> 23:56.680
yet.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.960
And it makes sense, because it's so far off that, you know, this stuff can change.

24:00.960 --> 24:08.680
But right now, apparently the Wii U console will be using a custom Radeon GPU with a chip

24:08.680 --> 24:18.920
similar to the R770, basically a chip that's found in some of the last generation ATI cards.

24:18.920 --> 24:27.520
For example, like the 770 is in the 4870, which is, you know, it's a decent card.

24:27.520 --> 24:35.520
It's better than some of the stuff that they have right now in the current gen consoles.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.400
So it's good, but who knows, you know, by the time that these next gen consoles come

24:40.400 --> 24:43.600
out, you know, what they're going to be packing.

24:43.600 --> 24:48.400
But it will be able to hold up with at least the 360 and PS3 and may even be able to push

24:48.400 --> 24:53.040
better graphics than that, so that's kind of cool.

24:53.040 --> 25:01.180
Of course, also it came out that the Wii U will not have a DVD or Blu-ray playback, mainly

25:01.180 --> 25:06.440
because it will actually be used in its own proprietary disk format.

25:06.440 --> 25:12.080
And there also, you know, explains, well, Wii doesn't have DVD or Blu-ray playback capabilities

25:12.080 --> 25:17.440
because, you know, the cost, and also they figured that enough people already have devices

25:17.440 --> 25:20.860
that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray.

25:20.860 --> 25:25.540
Good decision on Nintendo's part or bad?

25:25.540 --> 25:29.800
It's probably true to a certain extent, and also I think it helps them as far as piracy

25:29.800 --> 25:33.960
videos, because if it's their own disk format, you can't pop a, you know, if it's unable

25:33.960 --> 25:38.200
to read DVDs, you can't burn a game onto a DVD.

25:38.200 --> 25:42.320
Or you know, in the case, I mean, these games are going to be multiple gigabytes anyways,

25:42.320 --> 25:46.480
but you can't burn a Blu-ray backup or something like that.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.480
So it's going to use its own little format there to help...

25:48.480 --> 25:50.520
You're going to have to rip it off a hard drive.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
Alright.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.040
I'm kind of, at first I was surprised.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.740
I was like, wow, they're not going to support a movie format.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.740
That's kind of shocking.

25:59.740 --> 26:02.520
But then at the same time I was like, well, what Nintendo console really did support a

26:02.520 --> 26:03.520
movie format?

26:03.520 --> 26:06.440
I mean, GameCube didn't even play CDs.

26:06.440 --> 26:11.400
You know, the Wii certainly doesn't play DVDs unless I guess you do some hacking with it,

26:11.400 --> 26:13.580
which doesn't really count.

26:13.580 --> 26:16.880
But it does Netflix, and I'm sure this new system's going to do the Netflix and the Hulu

26:16.880 --> 26:18.080
and all that.

26:18.080 --> 26:23.360
And I guess now we're in a different spot with our movies than we were 10 years ago.

26:23.360 --> 26:27.280
I think there's a lot of people that rely on things like Netflix and Hulu and all the

26:27.280 --> 26:29.400
other download things to get their movies.

26:29.400 --> 26:34.200
And I think as long as Nintendo supports Netflix, which I'm sure it will, I think that's going

26:34.200 --> 26:35.200
to be enough.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.200
That's probably all it needs.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.200
I mean, the Wii was the best-selling system.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.400
It didn't even play DVDs.

26:38.400 --> 26:42.160
I always thought it was a little weird to hear that Nintendo might go Blu-ray, because

26:42.160 --> 26:46.600
Blu-ray's a Sony format, and I always thought that was a little weird, you know, whereas

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
I could see them...

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
But you can't really...

26:48.600 --> 26:53.480
I mean, they have their own proprietary format right now, but I don't know.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.960
You kind of either have to make your own or use theirs.

26:56.960 --> 27:01.360
Scott Pilgrim in our chat room says, the Panasonic Q. But the Panasonic Q was Panasonic.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.640
It was the other way around.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.000
They licensed Nintendo's thing.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It wasn't the other way.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.320
And besides, you couldn't even get that in America.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.720
Who owned a Panasonic Q?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.800
Not even Dark Sakura owned a Panasonic Q, so therefore no one owns one.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.800
All right.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.320
Maybe it's under the bed somewhere.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.400
Maybe it's what you're going to get for Christmas this year.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.640
Anyhow, moving on to more information about the current Wii and the DS.

27:22.640 --> 27:27.000
You know, one of the things that was kind of surprising at E3 this year is that there

27:27.000 --> 27:31.880
wasn't a lot of talk about what the heck is coming out on the Wii this year.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.920
But there are some games still slated for the Wii this holiday season.

27:34.920 --> 27:41.040
One of the big ones that barely got any coverage at E3, Kirby Wii, is coming out.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.780
So yeah, Kirby is supposed to be in the fall, out at some point.

27:44.780 --> 27:49.720
Some of the other games that are coming from Nintendo, they're putting out on the Wii.

27:49.720 --> 27:56.320
Wii Play Motion on June 13th, Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave Incident, on June 27th,

27:56.320 --> 28:01.200
Kirby Wii is in the fall, Fortune Street will be during the holiday, of course Zelda Skyward

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
Sword.

28:02.200 --> 28:07.520
Also, Mario Party 9 and Rhythm Heaven on the Wii are announced for later this year.

28:07.520 --> 28:12.160
Coming out from Nintendo on the DS later this year, not the 3DS, but the DS, Dragon Quest

28:12.160 --> 28:18.240
Monsters, Joker 2, Kirby Mass Attack, Professor Layton and the Last Specter for the fall,

28:18.240 --> 28:21.000
and Super Fossil Fighters over the holiday.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.740
Some of the other releases on the Wii, let me just kind of throw it out there.

28:23.740 --> 28:30.440
From Sega, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, that will be in November.

28:30.440 --> 28:36.000
Ubisoft is putting out more game show ports, Family Feud 2012 and Price is Right Decades

28:36.000 --> 28:44.240
in September, Just Dance 3 in the fall, WB Interactive has some movie tie-in games, also

28:44.240 --> 28:47.640
the Sesame Street franchise going on there.

28:47.640 --> 28:54.840
And then lastly, Konami has Dance Dance Revolution 2 in the fall, and what's sure to be a favorite

28:54.840 --> 29:01.040
here at OLR, Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3 in the fall, woohoo.

29:01.040 --> 29:09.120
Anyhow, how about the 3DS and moving forward, obviously the 3DS needs some bigger games

29:09.120 --> 29:13.980
in order to make people really want to get it because the launch titles have not been

29:13.980 --> 29:14.980
that great.

29:14.980 --> 29:20.680
So, Zelda's out now, which of course was released today, so that was one of the big releases

29:20.680 --> 29:25.120
and there's a lot of people probably going to jump on board finally for that game.

29:25.120 --> 29:30.480
But if not Zelda, then maybe Star Fox 64 3D, which is dated for September 11th, yeah it's

29:30.480 --> 29:32.200
Loki's birthday.

29:32.200 --> 29:37.800
Kid Icarus will be during the holiday, as will Mario Kart and Super Mario, however you'll

29:37.800 --> 29:43.640
have to wait until 2012 to play Lego City Stories and Luigi's Mansion 2.

29:43.640 --> 29:48.560
Not dated yet, Animal Crossing and Paper Mario, so I would assume those games are all the

29:48.560 --> 29:51.840
way out next summer, would be my guess.

29:51.840 --> 29:57.380
Some of the other things that are coming out on the 3DS, Ubisoft is putting out all that

29:57.380 --> 30:04.520
crap that they put out on the DS that sells millions, Pets Fantasy, Horses 3D, Imagine

30:04.520 --> 30:10.540
Babies 3D, Raving Rabbids 5, maybe a little more in the direction of stuff we'd actually

30:10.540 --> 30:16.560
play is coming out on the 3DS as well, Konami's putting out Frogger 3D in the fall, they've

30:16.560 --> 30:22.000
dated Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater for the winter, Majesco's got Cooking Mama 4,

30:22.000 --> 30:27.800
Kitchen Magic slated for October 11th, Capcom's got Resident Evil The Mercenaries dated June

30:27.800 --> 30:31.720
28th, I didn't realize that was coming out so soon, Resident Evil Revelations is a little

30:31.720 --> 30:38.080
further out, and then lastly from Activision, they've got Spiderman in the fall and a Transformers

30:38.080 --> 30:39.800
game to support the movie in June.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.400
So there is lots of stuff for the 3DS from the various third parties as well as Nintendo

30:43.400 --> 30:47.120
themselves all the way through the rest of the year.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.200
So Dark Sakura, going back to the Wii U.

30:49.200 --> 30:56.560
Well, in other Wii U news, they are only doing one controller for it because of some cost

30:56.560 --> 30:57.560
issue.

30:57.560 --> 31:06.360
Basically, Iwata said that they don't want buyers to have to buy multiple Wii U controllers.

31:06.360 --> 31:11.880
And by putting in different aspects of multiplayer that would involve the controller, they would

31:11.880 --> 31:16.240
be pretty much insisting that people buy another Wii U controller and they were trying to cut

31:16.240 --> 31:18.160
down costs for the consumer.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.480
I kind of don't see where that matters.

31:21.480 --> 31:29.680
I think just put in a strong single player and then, you know, later on add in.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.480
Here's the problem in my opinion is that the Wii is a party system.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.080
The Wii, especially when it first came out, was that system that got busted out at all

31:37.080 --> 31:38.080
the parties.

31:38.080 --> 31:42.000
Let's play Wii Tennis, let's play Mario Party, let's play, you know, Smash Brothers, whatever

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
the game was.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.920
It was very much about a lot of those multiplayer experiences.

31:45.920 --> 31:51.000
So it's very surprising that they've kind of said, well, multiplayer is not really going

31:51.000 --> 31:52.120
to be like that on the Wii U.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.980
I mean, granted, you will be able to use the Wiimote.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.520
You will be able to use the classic controller.

31:57.520 --> 32:02.240
So it's not like multiplayer experiences will be nonexistent.

32:02.240 --> 32:07.920
But when this controller is such a huge factor of what they're trying to drive, it's interesting

32:07.920 --> 32:13.280
that there's not going to be a thing where I could bring my Wii U controller over to

32:13.280 --> 32:17.080
someone else's house and play on that controller.

32:17.080 --> 32:23.780
But it's also not surprising because, remember, that controller is not a processor.

32:23.780 --> 32:28.640
The image that you see on that Wii U controller is not being processed by the controller.

32:28.640 --> 32:34.560
That's the biggest difference between the Wii U setup and what you've probably most

32:34.560 --> 32:38.400
familiar with leading into this would be the GameCube going to the Game Boy Advance.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.680
The Game Boy Advance has had processors in them.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.740
They could process the data and so forth.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.600
But the Wii U is all streaming from the box.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.720
So it makes sense that it can't maybe stream to more than one, although I think I read

32:49.720 --> 32:54.200
somewhere where it is actually capable of streaming to more than one, but it won't be

32:54.200 --> 32:55.200
as good.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.720
I don't know.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.040
But it's going to be interesting.

32:59.040 --> 33:04.640
I think there will be plenty of multiplayer experiences with the Classic Controller involved,

33:04.640 --> 33:08.240
and certainly all the demos they were showing were just the one and the Wiimotes.

33:08.240 --> 33:14.520
But yeah, it's a little disappointing to know that they're not going to try and do more.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.920
But I guess it would be expensive to do that.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.720
I mean, these controllers are probably going to be like a hundred bucks, and I know they've

33:20.720 --> 33:26.000
said they're not going to sell them separately, but what if I lose mine or it's broken?

33:26.000 --> 33:30.840
I think, I honestly don't think the controllers are going to be about a hundred bucks a pop.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.300
I really don't think so.

33:32.300 --> 33:37.800
I think you're maybe looking at, especially since it itself doesn't contain the processor,

33:37.800 --> 33:43.440
I think you're really going to be looking at more around fifty bucks for the controller.

33:43.440 --> 33:48.280
Game Guru in our chatroom says, I think this will kill the Wii U more than anything else.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.520
Again, at the end of the day, it's really all about the games.

33:51.520 --> 33:57.120
I have a really hard time being able to assess Wii U right now, because sure, I saw E3 like

33:57.120 --> 34:04.340
you guys did, and I see the controller and so forth and the demos, but no real games

34:04.340 --> 34:05.340
were shown.

34:05.340 --> 34:09.400
I mean, maybe like a couple of very loose conceptual things like Ghost Recon and what

34:09.400 --> 34:13.740
have you, but I'm sorry, there's not enough of what are the games really going to look

34:13.740 --> 34:15.000
like on this thing.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.600
And I don't think we're really going to know that answer until next E3.

34:17.600 --> 34:23.560
So, I feel like I can't really judge this system until I see how does this really play

34:23.560 --> 34:28.080
out or have they been able to think around these constraints really well.

34:28.080 --> 34:32.080
And to Nintendo's credit, I think that's one thing they do really well is that they design

34:32.080 --> 34:36.800
awesome games for the confines that they've built.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.800
So we'll see.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.060
Frisbee in our chatroom says, congratulations Nintendo, you defeated the entire purpose

34:41.060 --> 34:43.080
to buy this console for its controller.

34:43.080 --> 34:47.720
Can you imagine what families with multiple kids in it fighting over this controller?

34:47.720 --> 34:50.760
Good point.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.960
Gameguru in our chat says, really, they could have gutted a DS for this.

34:53.960 --> 34:58.640
I find it fascinating that we can't use DS's and 3DS's, at least not yet.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.840
Maybe that'll be something that comes out later as more controllers.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.600
I'm really surprised that it ended up happening.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
We'll see.

35:05.600 --> 35:10.640
You know, I honestly think that that's going to be the big reveal before it's released

35:10.640 --> 35:16.200
is that you get one of the Wii U controllers, but you can also use your other.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.440
I think that's going to be the big thing.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.440
We'll see.

35:19.440 --> 35:24.480
But, I mean, look at some of the concepts that they've showed off.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.480
New Super Mario Brothers Mii.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.200
We added Miis this time.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.900
I'm sorry, you don't need a new console to be that cheap.

35:32.900 --> 35:37.640
But hold on, they said, to be fair, they said this is not a game we're announcing.

35:37.640 --> 35:41.240
This is just a demo to show you what the system can do.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.240
It can do Miis.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.680
Oh my god.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.360
So can the normal Wii.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.640
Why even show that off?

35:46.640 --> 35:47.640
It was just stupid.

35:47.640 --> 35:52.640
I think the chase Mii and the shield stuff will ultimately get slapped into some mini

35:52.640 --> 35:55.580
game collection that is what the system will come with.

35:55.580 --> 35:56.580
Wii U parties.

35:56.580 --> 35:59.520
Oh yeah, all the tech demos are going to be in the fucking, they're going to be sold at

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
some point.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
Oh, we're not going to sell these games.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.880
These aren't real games.

36:02.880 --> 36:07.080
No, you're going to sell these games, because this is what you do, Nintendo.

36:07.080 --> 36:10.080
You're like, hmm, how can we get away with the least amount of work?

36:10.080 --> 36:13.720
Well, we made these tech demos and we're just sitting on them, let's put them together and

36:13.720 --> 36:17.440
charge 50 bucks for them, we'll throw in the Wii remote.

36:17.440 --> 36:21.280
They're going to the Weasley School of Test Design.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.520
The Wheatley School.

36:22.520 --> 36:28.600
I think that Nintendo, they still have a long time before this comes out, and I think they're

36:28.600 --> 36:31.680
going to have a lot of time to respond to some of this criticism.

36:31.680 --> 36:36.520
And I could definitely see Reggie coming out on stage at the next E3 saying, well, we heard

36:36.520 --> 36:41.600
a lot about this that you guys didn't like, so we did this.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.520
Was it contradictions?

36:43.520 --> 36:44.640
We can do that.

36:44.640 --> 36:51.160
We heard that you hate the fact that our analog joysticks, whatever, aren't really joysticks,

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
they're just circle pads.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.680
So you know what we did?

36:53.680 --> 36:56.520
We added more Miis into our games.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.600
Hope you enjoy it.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.760
We listened to the consumers.

37:01.760 --> 37:02.760
You know what?

37:02.760 --> 37:05.280
We heard that you don't like friend codes, so you know what we're going to do?

37:05.280 --> 37:06.680
We're going to have buddy codes.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.200
They're just like friend codes, but they're buddy codes.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.360
Yeah, we know nothing about online.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.360
That's the thing.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.000
I can't sit here and tell you I'm going to buy a Wii U or I'm not going to buy a Wii

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
U.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.360
And I don't think, honestly, any of you can sit here and tell me that you are or you aren't

37:22.360 --> 37:24.520
buying one, because we don't really know.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.400
We have an idea.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
This is all we've got.

37:27.400 --> 37:32.760
The idea, we see the direction Nintendo's going, but we don't see the path.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.520
And I think they've got a year to really impress us.

37:36.520 --> 37:40.880
Next E3, I'll tell you, if I think the Wii U is for me or not.

37:40.880 --> 37:41.880
What, Loki?

37:41.880 --> 37:42.880
You're laughing over there.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.880
I'm just like thinking, you know, the direction that they're going to come out.

37:45.880 --> 37:49.720
It's just going to be the same old shit with another gimmick attached to it.

37:49.720 --> 37:53.120
It's what it really is going to end up, they're going to take you through this elaborate path

37:53.120 --> 37:58.320
of promises and hopes and stuff and then we're just going to get right back to the Wii with

37:58.320 --> 38:03.000
a gimmicky piece of shit that's now another controller for it.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.500
People love gimmicky pieces of shit.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.520
Why else is the Wii been the number one console?

38:06.520 --> 38:07.520
Number one!

38:07.520 --> 38:11.440
Because it's cheap.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.720
Maybe this will end up being cheap too.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
No it's not.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
I don't know.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.200
It won't be as cheap, but it will be cheap.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.200
Alright.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.400
Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.840
I feel like we've talked Wii U to death between the E3 shows and so forth.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.880
At least Nintendo's got people talking.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.160
Everybody knows that name now.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.760
They may hate it, but they know it.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.200
Yeah, they know that name because that's all the fucking thing that they...

38:30.200 --> 38:31.200
That's all they showed.

38:31.200 --> 38:37.120
It was just, hey look, we got this game system that's not coming out for a year and a half.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
I gotta read the...

38:38.120 --> 38:40.480
There's actually a couple really good comments in chat I want to get here now that now we

38:40.480 --> 38:43.160
get some stuff on the Wii U here.

38:43.160 --> 38:47.680
Scott Pilgrim says, I'll buy a Wii U when Mario Kart comes out, if that.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.720
Game Guru says, all of them will be put into Wii U Sports and be packaged with the console,

38:51.720 --> 38:55.720
save New Super Mario Brothers Mii, which will come out separately and sell like 20 million

38:55.720 --> 38:56.720
copies.

38:56.720 --> 39:01.440
SSJ 100 Matt says, I felt Nintendo was forced into announcing the Wii U right now.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.280
Developers were working on games for it and was starting to leak out.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.960
They had to talk about it, this E3, because they wanted to put their spin on it.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.160
If you think about it, they did the same thing with the Wii revolution.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.160
Yeah.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.160
Agree.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.200
I feel like it was too early, but I understand.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.200
They had to.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.200
They had to.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.200
No, they didn't.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.200
Why'd they have to?

39:19.200 --> 39:20.200
Because it would have been leaked out otherwise.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.200
It was already leaked out.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.200
So what?

39:22.200 --> 39:23.200
We all knew it was a touch pad.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.200
We all knew.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.200
So what?

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
A big deal.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.200
Yeah.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.200
It just leaks out.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.200
You don't have to go and confirm it.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.200
You can just be motivated.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.200
Investors.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.200
It's still a wise corporate policy.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.200
They want people to invest.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.680
They want to convince the world that they're on to the next video.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.080
They want their stocks to go up.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.320
Well, that didn't work.

39:38.320 --> 39:42.640
Well, it went down, so I don't know.

39:42.640 --> 39:48.880
Just looking from a corporate point of view, they have a product there that they don't

39:48.880 --> 39:50.560
want misperceptions on.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.040
They want people to see it the way they want people to see it.

39:54.040 --> 39:57.320
Not just with speculation.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.780
It actually is a wise move on their part to go ahead and say, look, this is what we're

40:00.780 --> 40:01.780
working on.

40:01.780 --> 40:04.280
We're just going to pull back the curtain a little bit.

40:04.280 --> 40:10.240
But not give us, and basically they've directed the speculation is what they've done.

40:10.240 --> 40:14.680
I honestly think if you take a step back and just look at, you know, what people are talking

40:14.680 --> 40:18.160
about, Twitter, sphere, whatever, good, bad, whatever, you know what they say, whether

40:18.160 --> 40:20.940
they're talking bad or talking good, they're talking about you.

40:20.940 --> 40:27.480
People by far out of this E3 are talking about Wii U and then probably in a distant second

40:27.480 --> 40:34.080
the Vita, and then Microsoft doesn't even chart with what they showed.

40:34.080 --> 40:38.400
I mean, to the gamers, yeah, I mean, Halo 4 I guess would be maybe like a way distant

40:38.400 --> 40:39.400
third.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.400
Whoopity shit.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.800
That's what I say about Halo 4.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.480
And I'm not knocking Microsoft.

40:44.480 --> 40:47.920
I'm just saying they didn't show anything at the press conference that really has people

40:47.920 --> 40:48.920
buzzing.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.640
And of course they didn't show a new console.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.720
Although they did show that whole cable TV thing, which I thought was going to be a lot

40:54.720 --> 40:56.520
bigger deal than it seems to be.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
But whatever.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
Anyhow.

40:58.520 --> 41:04.180
SJ100Matt says, if it was leaked out not on their terms, then it would have been misconstrued

41:04.180 --> 41:05.180
and confused.

41:05.180 --> 41:07.920
So what Jamie said.

41:07.920 --> 41:12.400
GameGuru says, I'm not sure, it depends on if the Wii U's uniqueness can overshadow connect

41:12.400 --> 41:14.040
among the casuals.

41:14.040 --> 41:19.000
Doomplague in chat.orchester.com says, they needed to get the attention of publishers,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.180
developers on board.

41:20.180 --> 41:23.000
That was the whole point of showing the Wii U, in my opinion.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Alright, let's move on.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.840
I want to talk about something that's not Nintendo.

41:25.840 --> 41:30.640
I know it's a three hour show, but there's plenty of other news going on too.

41:30.640 --> 41:35.480
Well, Bungie is celebrating their 20th anniversary.

41:35.480 --> 41:39.620
And of course they're going to reveal some new things about Bungie, including this Bungie

41:39.620 --> 41:43.120
aerospace thing that they've been teasing for a while.

41:43.120 --> 41:49.060
Among that stuff, and actually I think it's available now, if you have an iOS device,

41:49.060 --> 41:55.400
you can download an actual application that's free.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.400
That's kind of neat.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.080
It basically kind of ties in with the Bungie website.

41:59.080 --> 42:08.120
It's called Bungie Mobile, and you can check out your stats for Reach and all sorts of

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
stuff.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.200
You can sign up for giveaways and...

42:12.200 --> 42:13.200
Downloading?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.480
Yeah, different things like that.

42:14.480 --> 42:19.920
I don't play a lot of Halo, so this isn't really something I'd download, but it's kind

42:19.920 --> 42:20.920
of cool.

42:20.920 --> 42:24.200
And it's free, and it's available right now, so Bungie Mobile.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.200
Check it out.

42:25.200 --> 42:31.920
Then of course, as something that's a little bit funny, part of this Halo Fest that's going

42:31.920 --> 42:39.760
to be going on, I guess they're going to be showing off the Halo Combat Evolved HD.

42:39.760 --> 42:45.040
And with that, they're going to have six custom-made Duke controllers.

42:45.040 --> 42:51.600
Now you remember, the Duke controller is the original Xbox controller, the one that was

42:51.600 --> 42:54.920
the size of a small single-family home.

42:54.920 --> 42:58.640
The size of Duke Nukem's ego.

42:58.640 --> 43:02.480
So they're going to have those made in a very limited run, and they're going to be auctioned

43:02.480 --> 43:03.880
off as well.

43:03.880 --> 43:10.760
And I guess Halo Fest will run alongside PAX Prime from Friday, August 26th to Sunday,

43:10.760 --> 43:15.360
August 28th at the Washington State Convention Center.

43:15.360 --> 43:20.720
Which, by the way, mission is free if you have your PAX badge.

43:20.720 --> 43:24.240
If you want to go play with an original Xbox controller.

43:24.240 --> 43:25.440
Yes.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.440
And have your hands hurt after spending some time with them.

43:28.440 --> 43:33.600
You may throw out your back lifting the controller.

43:33.600 --> 43:38.000
DarkSakura, you hated those old Xbox controllers, didn't you?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.880
Because my hands are smaller.

43:39.880 --> 43:44.920
It really did, it was just painful after a while, but I mean, I can handle a big controller

43:44.920 --> 43:48.560
as long as the ergonomics are reasonable.

43:48.560 --> 43:53.440
Like, Saturn Dual Analog controller, you know, I've told everybody that's my favorite controller

43:53.440 --> 43:55.760
ever, but it's kind of bulky.

43:55.760 --> 43:59.720
But it fits reasonably in the hand, and that's the problem, is that my thumbs just won't

43:59.720 --> 44:03.520
reach.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.920
I never actually touched one of the original Xbox controllers.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.200
By the time I bought an Xbox, I bought...

44:09.200 --> 44:10.480
I could fix that.

44:10.480 --> 44:13.440
I'm sure I've mentioned this on the show before, but when I bought an Xbox, I actually bought

44:13.440 --> 44:15.040
a Halo Xbox.

44:15.040 --> 44:19.000
It's a green, translucent kind of Xbox, it's very different from the other ones that are

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
out there.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
That's the same one we have.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Oh yeah?

44:22.000 --> 44:25.840
Yeah, they were limited edition or something, but it came with Halo.

44:25.840 --> 44:29.560
So believe it or not, when I first played Halo, I loved it.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.920
And yeah, I played it at a wedding.

44:32.920 --> 44:37.840
My friends had got married, and it was a Halo kind of a very subtle Halo theme to the wedding.

44:37.840 --> 44:41.600
And yeah, they were just those kinds of people where it was like, okay, we're married, let's

44:41.600 --> 44:42.600
play Halo.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.720
And everybody brought TVs, and it was like a local area thing, because obviously Xbox

44:45.720 --> 44:47.040
Live wasn't on the first one.

44:47.040 --> 44:51.280
Oh, like, do you know that that's exactly what my husband's bachelor party was?

44:51.280 --> 44:52.280
Yeah.

44:52.280 --> 45:00.440
Was cases of beer, about eight TVs set up all over my house, and lots of Halo land.

45:00.440 --> 45:03.880
Meanwhile, you remember my party.

45:03.880 --> 45:04.880
Let's watch Xana do and go drink.

45:04.880 --> 45:05.880
I do, I do.

45:05.880 --> 45:06.880
All right.

45:06.880 --> 45:11.200
Going to our chat room at chat.orangelandsrader.com, Game Guru says, the Duke should be stricken

45:11.200 --> 45:12.200
from memory.

45:12.200 --> 45:13.800
Controller S was vastly superior.

45:13.800 --> 45:18.520
SSJ100Matt says, the Dreamcast controller was bulky, but it was one of my favorite controllers.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.480
I really liked the Dreamcast controller too.

45:20.480 --> 45:24.680
I loved the whole idea of the VMUs.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.840
It's kind of a bummer that didn't really stick.

45:26.840 --> 45:31.240
I mean, I guess, ironically, some are saying that that's what the Wii U controllers are,

45:31.240 --> 45:32.480
but they're really not.

45:32.480 --> 45:37.440
They're kind of different, because you can't really take that controller and just take

45:37.440 --> 45:41.960
it out by itself and do anything really with it, especially if you step too far away from

45:41.960 --> 45:43.280
the Wii U box.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.280
Anyhow, let's talk about free stuff.

45:46.280 --> 45:47.280
That's right.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.280
Free games, legal.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.920
This whole thing's illegal free games.

45:49.920 --> 45:55.920
If you're looking for something new to play, you need to look no further and pass Steam.

45:55.920 --> 46:00.240
Steam has added five free-to-play games available on Steam.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.720
You can download them just like anything else.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.240
These are all like free-to-play MMOs.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.400
The games are Spiral Knights, I should say free-to-play games.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.880
They're not all necessarily MMOs.

46:09.880 --> 46:15.600
Spiral Knights, Forsaken Worlds, Champions Online, Free For All, Global Agenda Free Agent,

46:15.600 --> 46:17.200
and Alliance of Valiant Arms.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.480
They are all on Steam right now available for you to download.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.360
I know some people have been checking them out.

46:22.360 --> 46:25.400
I've seen our webmaster, Deep Man, has been playing Spiral Knights.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.320
I saw some of his pictures.

46:27.320 --> 46:30.920
And they got to the point where it was like, hey, you want to keep playing the good stuff?

46:30.920 --> 46:32.680
Now you got to give us money.

46:32.680 --> 46:38.080
So that's the only bummer with the free-to-play games is that a lot of them really just feel

46:38.080 --> 46:44.000
like extended demos, especially like what was that one on PlayStation 3 that was so

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
stupid?

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
Free Realms, the one where you can play as a fairy and everything is blocked off unless

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
you pay for it.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
That's why I haven't downloaded anything.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.400
They're just demos.

46:53.400 --> 46:54.400
But I don't know.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.720
Some people get more out of this.

46:55.720 --> 46:59.480
I hear some of these other ones have a little more robust experience, like Champions Online

46:59.480 --> 47:00.480
and Global Agenda.

47:00.480 --> 47:04.000
A little more of the robust experience, but haven't played it myself.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.440
But if you are looking for something new to try, maybe these things will be up your alley.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.440
Check it out.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.080
Well, I did go to try to find you one of my Xbox controllers.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.080
Oh, really?

47:12.080 --> 47:13.880
And I couldn't find it, but I did find this.

47:13.880 --> 47:14.880
A Sega.

47:14.880 --> 47:15.880
Now see, I never owned a Saturn.

47:15.880 --> 47:16.880
The Saturn Dual Analog Controller.

47:16.880 --> 47:17.880
I never owned a Saturn.

47:17.880 --> 47:18.880
Now feel it.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.040
This looks like a mini pizza the way the disc is.

47:22.040 --> 47:28.040
Well, just hold it in both hands for a second, because now you see how natural it feels.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.040
It actually feels super natural.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.120
It's not super natural, but you know what I mean?

47:31.120 --> 47:33.360
Really easy to do.

47:33.360 --> 47:40.560
The D-pad's a little weird, kind of like it is on Xbox, but I really like this 360, the

47:40.560 --> 47:42.080
hell's the name of these, the Analog.

47:42.080 --> 47:44.760
In my opinion, it's the best controller ever made.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.200
There you go.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.200
Let me see.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.480
Oh, Loki wants to touch it.

47:49.480 --> 47:53.520
Well, while Loki's touching my controller, I'll go ahead and read the next story.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.520
How's that sound?

47:55.520 --> 47:56.520
Sure.

47:56.520 --> 47:58.960
Zynga likes to sue people.

47:58.960 --> 48:04.600
Well, now they have another company they're going after called Vostu.

48:04.600 --> 48:08.560
It's a Brazilian company, and they are getting in on Cityville.

48:08.560 --> 48:11.360
They have Vostu's Mega City.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.740
And if you look at the screen captures, it's fairly identical, although I have to say that

48:14.740 --> 48:20.760
some of Vostu's in-game sprites actually look a lot nicer.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.760
But they are...

48:22.760 --> 48:24.760
Excuse me.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.680
You're right over there.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.680
All right.

48:27.680 --> 48:31.200
Hey, I told you I'm sick.

48:31.200 --> 48:37.520
But they basically copied everything down, and this is actually in the complaint.

48:37.520 --> 48:44.840
And I need to read this, because this is just, like, this is Zynga going, oh, you whore,

48:44.840 --> 48:45.840
no way.

48:45.840 --> 48:51.720
Vostu has brazenly appropriated the copyright protected aspects of Zynga's games, as well

48:51.720 --> 48:59.160
as almost every other aspect of Zynga's business, with scant effort to mask their strategy.

48:59.160 --> 49:03.440
And then offered games virtually identical to Zynga's games to prospective players in

49:03.440 --> 49:05.640
the United States and elsewhere.

49:05.640 --> 49:13.800
And they did actually side-by-side video with, you know, cleaning a pet, and the whole video

49:13.800 --> 49:17.280
is here.

49:17.280 --> 49:24.160
But they also copied mistakes, so it looks like they're actually copying code.

49:24.160 --> 49:30.440
Things that were already bugs in the games.

49:30.440 --> 49:37.680
And like, for example, there was one in Cityville where the requirement that the community buildings

49:37.680 --> 49:45.560
be connected to a road to function, it actually was copied over as a bug into Vostu's game

49:45.560 --> 49:46.960
too.

49:46.960 --> 49:50.280
So there's, it looks like there's quite a bit going on.

49:50.280 --> 49:54.800
The whole lawsuit actually is online.

49:54.800 --> 50:03.680
So it looks like they're trying to get them to shut down operations, and if you also look

50:03.680 --> 50:13.280
at the, they had to raise $45.9 million in funds, Vostu did, to get their thing going.

50:13.280 --> 50:17.520
So I find this stuff kind of ironic, because didn't Zynga kind of get their start copying

50:17.520 --> 50:18.520
other people's games?

50:18.520 --> 50:21.280
Like, isn't Farmville taken from Farm Town or something?

50:21.280 --> 50:30.800
Well now, here's the other thing, looking at the company's stats too, is that Vostu

50:30.800 --> 50:38.840
was founded February 1st, 2007, Zynga was founded July 2007, with more money behind

50:38.840 --> 50:39.840
them.

50:39.840 --> 50:40.840
Interesting.

50:40.840 --> 50:46.960
And Vostu was located in New York, where Zynga is located in San Francisco.

50:46.960 --> 50:47.960
So fairly interesting.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.200
It's an East Coast, West Coast thing.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.200
That's right.

50:51.200 --> 50:57.400
It's gonna go down, and it's all gonna go down in Cityville.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.760
There's gonna be drive-by shootings and things.

50:59.760 --> 51:05.600
They're just gonna have to prove, it's basically gonna come down to which code is older, you

51:05.600 --> 51:06.600
know?

51:06.600 --> 51:17.360
But yeah, looking at these photos, and I'll show the chatroom too, it's pretty identical.

51:17.360 --> 51:22.520
Basically Zynga feels pretty confident in this, or they wouldn't be suing, so, you know.

51:22.520 --> 51:27.280
I just find it ironic that it's Zynga accusing someone else of being evil.

51:27.280 --> 51:33.880
So, I'm really sick and tired of Facebook games that keep wanting you to publish shit

51:33.880 --> 51:36.400
and click like and all this stuff.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.400
It's just such garbage.

51:37.400 --> 51:41.360
You know, there's more of this shit going on too, you remember what I was telling you

51:41.360 --> 51:47.840
about on the way to Disneyland, about WTF Forever 21, the blog.

51:47.840 --> 51:53.520
This girl basically was just like, you know, pointing out stuff in the Forever 21 catalog

51:53.520 --> 51:57.360
that was ugly, and you know, blogging about it.

51:57.360 --> 52:04.320
And they're saying that she's copying their stuff, and Forever 21 is a big copier of actual

52:04.320 --> 52:09.360
designers like Anna Sui and, you know, big name designers.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.600
So I thought that was really hilarious.

52:11.600 --> 52:15.680
But it's been, I mean, I can name other companies though that are doing the same thing that's

52:15.680 --> 52:23.880
basically like, you know, oh well, we're going to get you for doing nothing that's like what

52:23.880 --> 52:24.880
we're doing.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.760
Breakman in our chatroom takes issue with your story, DarkSakura.

52:27.760 --> 52:31.660
He says, whatever, those two games are completely different.

52:31.660 --> 52:35.880
One is using a completely different shade of brown than the other.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.080
It all comes down to the source code.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.840
It all comes down to the source code.

52:39.840 --> 52:40.840
We'll see.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.360
All right, anyhow, we're going to move on and cover some release dates and check out

52:44.360 --> 52:47.640
what is coming out to a gaming store near you very soon.

52:47.640 --> 52:50.320
We'll start off in, sorry, US.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.340
In the US state of Japan.

52:52.340 --> 52:55.360
That's why I almost said Japan because I was bringing up my Japanese dates, but we're not

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
starting there.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.480
So actually, some decent stuff this week.

52:59.480 --> 53:06.880
Not a whole lot though, I mean, it's still, still a slow time of the year.

53:06.880 --> 53:12.880
Some EA though, and this is kind of cool, it's kind of a collaboration between, I want

53:12.880 --> 53:23.000
to say, Suda51 and the guy that created Resident Evil, and basically it's Shadows of the Damned,

53:23.000 --> 53:31.160
kind of a grindhouse-ish, I kind of call it like a grindhouse-ish Dante's Inferno game.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.160
It's pretty awesome.

53:32.160 --> 53:37.880
So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

53:37.880 --> 53:47.400
Also I believe that they are re-releasing, in case you don't have Call of Duty Black

53:47.400 --> 53:53.840
Ops, you can get Call of Duty Black Ops now with the first download pack with that, so

53:53.840 --> 53:59.000
that's going to be out there for 60 bucks as well.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.680
And then also this week we've got Dungeon Siege 3, that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

54:06.680 --> 54:07.680
and PC.

54:07.680 --> 54:17.320
Today, or I believe actually no later this week, Wii Play Motion will be coming out from

54:17.320 --> 54:23.280
Nintendo, and that of course is not a mini-game collection of course, because why would they

54:23.280 --> 54:28.320
throw tech demos into a game, that will also be coming out with the Wii Remote Plus.

54:28.320 --> 54:32.080
Cars 2, the video game, tying in with the upcoming movie, it's on all major formats,

54:32.080 --> 54:38.120
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

54:38.120 --> 54:46.320
Also Gods and Heroes of Rome Rising, that's coming out on PC.

54:46.320 --> 54:55.320
There's some PSP 2 packs that are coming out, kind of some cheap games, Kills and Liberation,

54:55.320 --> 55:02.000
Siphon Filters Logan Challenge, that's on PSP for $14.99, not bad.

55:02.000 --> 55:11.360
And then also they have a couple other collections this week as well, let's see here, I'll get

55:11.360 --> 55:12.360
back to that.

55:12.360 --> 55:22.200
Anyways, Fear 3 also this week, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

55:22.200 --> 55:29.360
Arma 2 Reinforcements on PC, Dual Pen Sports on the 3DS, which I'm not sure how that works

55:29.360 --> 55:33.000
considering that the 3DS is not multi-touch.

55:33.000 --> 55:41.160
Pets Fantasy for the 3DS, yes now bringing the ever loved Pets franchise to the 3DS.

55:41.160 --> 55:42.160
Thank you Ubisoft.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.160
Yay.

55:43.160 --> 55:45.360
Yeah I know everyone's excited about that.

55:45.360 --> 55:56.120
And let's see, I believe that's actually it, a week from today I believe Mystery Case Files

55:56.120 --> 56:04.480
the Malgrave Incident from Nintendo, in case you like that on the DS.

56:04.480 --> 56:08.880
Alright moving over to Japan and looking at what is coming out on the Japanese releases

56:08.880 --> 56:13.760
this week, coming out on June 23rd, which by the way also happens to be the 9th birthday

56:13.760 --> 56:15.840
of OLR, June 23rd.

56:15.840 --> 56:20.040
Grand Theft Auto IV, the complete edition coming out in Japan, might seem a little late

56:20.040 --> 56:23.680
but I believe those releases are localized for Japan so they have to go back and redo

56:23.680 --> 56:25.720
the text and the acting and all that stuff.

56:25.720 --> 56:29.920
So that is coming out finally this week, that is the big release on Xbox 360.

56:29.920 --> 56:33.960
Coming out on PlayStation 3 this week on the 23rd, some more choices for you.

56:33.960 --> 56:38.100
Mass Effect 2, the Japanese release is out this week as well as of course the Grand Theft

56:38.100 --> 56:39.640
Auto IV collection.

56:39.640 --> 56:44.640
Bleach Soul Ignition out from Sony this week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

56:44.640 --> 56:52.160
And lastly a game called Meru no Atlier, Arland no Reken Jutsuji comes out this week from

56:52.160 --> 56:56.000
Gust, and I don't know if this is a game that is out here.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Yes it is.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Is it?

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
What is this?

56:59.000 --> 57:04.240
Is this the, oh Atlier, they do have the Atlier series out here, so this is like a role playing

57:04.240 --> 57:05.240
game.

57:05.240 --> 57:08.180
I think we have one of these at home we haven't played yet, like the last one in the series.

57:08.180 --> 57:10.680
That's on the PlayStation 3 this week.

57:10.680 --> 57:13.100
And then moving on to some of the other consoles.

57:13.100 --> 57:20.680
Going to the Nintendo Wii this week, actually let me do the PSP first, Gloria Union this

57:20.680 --> 57:26.680
week and Gundam Memories, Tataki no Kyoku comes out this week.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.560
And trying to see if there's anything on the Wii.

57:29.560 --> 57:34.200
Earth Seeker comes out this week, sorry that is not the same thing as Earthbound, but there

57:34.200 --> 57:37.720
is a game called Earth Seeker that's coming out this week.

57:37.720 --> 57:43.280
This looks like kind of like an RPG-ish type of game, but with the Wii graphics.

57:43.280 --> 57:46.040
Whatever happened to The Last Guardian, I thought they were going to announce that at

57:46.040 --> 57:47.040
E3 this year for the Wii.

57:47.040 --> 57:50.040
That's supposed to be a kick-ass game on the Wii.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.640
From The Last Guardian?

57:51.640 --> 57:55.040
No not The Last Guardian, dammit no, I'm thinking that's the PlayStation 3.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.360
What am I thinking of?

57:56.360 --> 57:58.120
There's some big role playing game from Mistwalker.

57:58.120 --> 57:59.120
Last Story.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.120
Thank you, Last Story.

58:00.120 --> 58:03.120
One word difference.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.120
Completely different games though.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.760
Yeah sorry, my bad.

58:05.760 --> 58:12.920
All right, Nintendo 3DS Japan this week, Fish Eyes 3D, at least it's not Fish Heads 3D,

58:12.920 --> 58:17.720
Fish Eyes 3D and Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions come out this week.

58:17.720 --> 58:21.160
Fishing games are huge in Japan, I'm telling you, this is what Fish Eyes is, it's a fishing

58:21.160 --> 58:22.160
game.

58:22.160 --> 58:26.440
And it looks like it takes like real scenes, like this very tranquil little lake in the

58:26.440 --> 58:30.640
woods and then you can just rope in these dead fish.

58:30.640 --> 58:32.720
Well who would want to rope in dead fish?

58:32.720 --> 58:36.720
Oh no, you rope them in while they're alive and kicking and then they die when they're

58:36.720 --> 58:38.960
sitting in the styrofoam container.

58:38.960 --> 58:41.880
All the radiation in the water killed them.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.320
Kidding, I'm kidding, gosh, gosh, all right.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.320
That's very insensitive of you.

58:45.320 --> 58:48.560
I was completely insensitive, but all right, let's move on.

58:48.560 --> 58:54.080
Okay, on the 24th we have Dream Trigger 3D for 3DS, this is their UK releases.

58:54.080 --> 59:02.500
Fear 3 for PlayStation 3 PC, Xbox 360, Get Fit with Mel B, Who Cares, Gods and Heroes

59:02.500 --> 59:09.080
Room Rising, Let's Dance with Mel B, Who Else Cares, Shadows of the Damned, Call of Duty

59:09.080 --> 59:15.480
Black Ops Annihilation Pack, sorry that was the 28th, my bad, done.

59:15.480 --> 59:17.920
All right, it's a quick week.

59:17.920 --> 59:21.620
Some more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer takes

59:21.620 --> 59:25.200
a stroll through the classic game archives and she will in just a moment.

59:25.200 --> 59:29.080
I could not find my controller by the way, I tried to find you an old controller.

59:29.080 --> 59:34.280
I melted it down and made two of the other controllers out of it.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.280
I think we actually did get rid of them.

59:35.280 --> 59:36.280
I don't know.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.280
All right, moving on.

59:37.280 --> 59:42.720
Melted it down to two full-size station wagons.

59:42.720 --> 59:46.640
So since we were talking about lawsuits with Zynga, let's talk about lawsuits with Infinity

59:46.640 --> 59:47.640
Ward and Activision.

59:47.640 --> 59:52.800
Yeah, I remember them, they were suing each other back and forth and good luck for both

59:52.800 --> 59:58.140
of them because both lawsuits in either direction were approved.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:07.120
So the lawsuit filed against Activision by Infinity Ward is moving forward and I guess

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.760
that the claims have merit.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.080
Also apparently the judge has allowed the countersuit to move forward as well.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.880
So it'll be interesting to see how that pans out.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:25.600
And then since we're talking about Activision here and everybody loves Bobby Kotick, Bobby

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:43.280
Kotick actually has a cameo as I guess a manager of a baseball team in Moneyball, the new Brad

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.080
Pitt movie about the Oakland A's.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.160
Wait, wait, they made a movie about the Oakland A's?

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.160
Yeah.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Why?

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.000
Because there was this coach that came in and changed the way they do drafting or whatever

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.600
and it was a big deal.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.640
Why don't they make a movie about a good baseball team?

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.640
Why don't they make a movie about the Giants?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.440
Field of Dreams.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.000
A League of Their Own.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.400
I'd be more interested in seeing A League of Their Own again and watching a movie about

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.200
the Oakland A's.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.720
Moving on, one more story for you guys and this has been all over the press this week.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.360
I'm sure you guys have heard, but some of your favorite gaming websites were hacked.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.720
That's right, Bethesda was hacked earlier this week and yeah, Bethesda apparently had

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.200
200,000 user accounts compromised there.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.440
So yeah, be careful if you were a member of Bethesda's forums.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.120
Also the same hackers took down Minecraft, Eve Online, and the Escapist Magazine.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.680
A lot of this was from denial of service attacks, a very popular way to bring down websites

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680
out there.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.640
Eve Online was taken offline for several hours as was the Escapist Magazine online.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.240
I think Minecraft was down for a little bit, but they came back up pretty quick.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:10.280
So just good rule of thumb here, the same hacker group released I think 62,000 login

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.000
and passwords.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.420
Don't use the same password on Bethesda's website or Square Enix's forums or whatever

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.640
gaming forums you log into.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.360
Don't use the same password there that you use on PayPal.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.560
This is a real chance for you to evaluate the passwords that you use and we kind of

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.360
throw this out there as a warning to those out there that don't want to end up in the

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.720
same boat because you know what we say on the show, I'm not condoning what these guys

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.040
are doing, but you know the old saying, hackers are going to hack and for whatever the reason,

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.800
whether it be they're trying to make a point or trying to steal money or whatever it is.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:56.600
So just make sure you don't use the same password for your banking that you do on the

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.040
Orange Islands Radio forums even.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:05.060
Because I'll tell you what, PHPBB is what we use and what a lot of different websites

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.820
use and if you, those things I'm sure can get hacked pretty easy.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:14.040
So don't use the same password on anything like that that you would use for your bank

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040
or your PayPal.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.400
Have different passwords.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.520
This public service announcement brought to you by us.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520
Yes.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.360
Alright, moving on, let's get into some classic gaming.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.360
We're going to take a stroll down memory lane.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.220
DarkSakura has picked a classic game or games as the case may be tonight that she's going

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.440
to highlight as the classic game of the week.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:40.240
It's the one and only true love for this week in gaming.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.360
DarkSakura, what should the kids out there be playing this week?

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.360
Contra.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.800
I selected the Contra series.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.920
Right, because I think you did the Contra game a while ago, but now we've got the whole

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
damn series.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.440
Okay, I don't remember doing Contra, but okay.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.360
So yeah, basically it's, the series started in 1987.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:04.000
It's a run and gun style shooter and it came out as Contra and then we had the really super

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.320
Contra in 1988 and a bunch of other Contras.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.880
And now this is actually just my old Japanese studies that makes me pretty giddy is that

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.400
it was, in Japanese it was written out in Ateji which is like using the kanji but for

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400
their pronunciation.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.200
So I thought it was pretty interesting.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.240
And it actually, the first one came out after, the arcade one, came out after the I ran Contra

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.760
affair and people were like, well is this about that?

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.520
And there was an ending theme, it was called Sandinista.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.560
I don't know if anyone remembers the whole Contras and Sandinista thing.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.720
I remember it.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.840
So yeah.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:58.440
The original is side scrolling but you've got a few 3D view areas is what they were

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.400
called where it's behind you and then a couple of overhead ones like in Super Contra and

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.200
Contra 3 the Alien Wars.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:13.080
There, the ones that deviated were the ones that were done by Appaloosa which was Contra

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:18.200
like Sea of War, Sea of the Contra Adventure and Neo Contra.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:25.880
Contra Shattered Soldier had the side view but it was all rendered in 3D.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:32.680
And then basically they were all two player except for the MSX2 version of Contra and

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.200
Operation Sea for the Gameboy.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.720
Those were only single player.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.880
So you get different weapons and you can replace your regular gun with a laser gun or a spread

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:49.200
gun, rapid bullets, they increase your fire speed.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:55.640
You can also get the mega shell in Super Contra or bombs in Contra 3 and Contra hardcore.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:01.680
There's all kinds of neat stuff but the biggest thing about Contra is that it was hard and

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.120
for the record the NES version of Contra does use the Konami code.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.000
It gives you 30 lives instead of 3.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.960
Probably the most infamous game to use the Konami code because you couldn't really beat

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
it without it.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.720
I mean let's be real.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:20.540
Most of the other ones had the extra lives codes in the Japanese releases such as Contra

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.140
Spirits which was Contra 3 over here and Contra hardcore.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:31.960
So the games in the series we have Contra which is on Arcade, MSX2, DOS, C64, CPC, ZX

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:38.280
and then Super Contra, Arcade, NES, DOS and Amiga, Operation Sea on Gameboy, Contra 3

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:45.400
the Alien Wars which was SNES, Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, Contra Force on the NES, Contra hardcore

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:50.320
which was on Genesis slash Mega Drive, Contra Legacy of War on Playstation and Saturn which

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.520
I think we have the Saturn one of that I want to say.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.480
See the Contra Adventure on Playstation, Contra Shattered Soldier on PS2, Neo Contra on PS2,

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.120
Contra 4 on Nintendo DS.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:09.040
That was done by WayForward technology and it actually had two screens that you know

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.040
because it was a DS you had different kinds of views that you could use.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:22.040
There was Contra Rebirth that was done by M2 for WiiWare and Hardcore Uprising which

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:28.080
was on PS3, Xbox 360 and that's a downloadable title released this year.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:35.120
There were re-releases of Contra and Super Contra, there were DOS ports, there was the

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:45.440
Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 is the X Spectrum and in Europe it came out as Gryzor.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.920
There are actually mobile phone versions to Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:56.280
As far as cancelled games there was Contra Spirit 64 which was in development by Konami

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:04.200
of Osaka however it was cancelled when the development team disbanded and that was being

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.240
worked on in 1998.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:15.640
For other ones, I love this game Konami YY World which is on Famicom, it actually had

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:21.400
the same boss theme that was used in the original Contra and it came out right before Contra.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:31.160
YY World 2, SOS, Parsley Joe, Bill Rizer is a playable character in there, Snatcher.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:37.160
The two characters Bill and Lance go to a Konami themed party held at the Outer Heaven

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:45.400
Show Pub and they are replaced by Light and Pastel from Twinbee but in the 32 bit version

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.240
of the game there's a Contra ad in there.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.760
There's Nanobreaker, Jaguar from Neocontra is a hidden character, Best Student Council

01:08:52.760 --> 01:09:00.260
which is a TV anime produced by Konami, there was a character called Lance Bean who was

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:04.200
a mod to a Contra character.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:15.760
Palaparokun Pocket 8 had a Contra parody in it, Silent Hill Shattered Memories is in a

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:21.680
movie theater that has Konami arcade machines including the original Contra and if you make

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:28.160
care you stare at it he'll go some real classics and then Rocket Knight when you play as Gold

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:36.680
Sparkster it has Bill Rizer shooting the spread gun at Gold Sparkster when he flies away.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:42.480
These were all set in the 27th century, well the initial Contra and the sequels had Bill

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:48.520
Rizer and Lance Bean who were modeled after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:54.640
and then they were named after actors that were in Aliens as in Bill Paxton and Paul

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:03.080
Rizer so and then Lance Henriksen and Michael Bean for Lance Bean so I thought that was

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:09.080
neat and then after that it sort of deviated and had different people and then Contra Shattered

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:16.680
Soldier brought back Bill Rizer who was a war criminal and then Neocontra also had him

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.920
in there too but it was a clone, oh well, spoilers!

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:32.480
As far as differences in the different versions there were some changes in between the Japanese

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:39.400
and US ones mostly in character naming and who the characters were supposed to be and

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:45.620
there were also different you know bad guys who were named different like the Red Falcon

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:53.800
was actually the Tenoki Gabba was what his name was, the Emperor Demon Gabba and then

01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:00.800
there was Mad Dog and Scorpion were given to Bill and Lance in the NES versions.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:08.320
When it came out in Europe and Australia it was called Probotector and they were robots

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:17.240
so they weren't Bill and Lance and then different versions came out as I said earlier as Gryzor

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:22.800
and then Super Protector Alien Rebels which is Contra through the Alien Wars.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:32.480
For Game Boy they were also put out as Probotector and then the Wii versions were released as

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:42.200
Probotector in the UK, Contra 4 did not get released in Europe but Probotector was in

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.040
the game as in character so that's it.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.360
Good Lord that's a lot of Contra!

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360
Yeah.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.520
But it's a great series, hard as hell.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
No seriously.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.640
But very rewarding if you can actually make your way through the games so.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.640
Seriously.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.720
Alright we're going to take a break guys but don't go anywhere because we're going to be

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.440
back with more of Orange Lounge Radio including some rapid fire news, your Twitter topics

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.920
so get those in Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you have something you want us to talk about

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.280
or any questions for us tonight.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.900
We're going to talk about Kinect making its way to the PC, we're going to talk a little

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.400
more about that Silent Hill collection that was announced at E3, some more details coming

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.840
out on that and Nintendo's stance on free to play games, we're going to talk a little

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840
more about that.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:30.120
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.560
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:38.960
We are live with episode number 416 of our show on this June 19th, 2011.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:39.960
You know what next week is?

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.040
It's going to be June 26th, 2011 and that's the closest show to our 9th birthday as a

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.160
station June 23rd or I should say as a show.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.280
We used to have a station on Life is Five but then of course we folded that a few years

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.280
ago.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.320
Hence our new home at All Games which we like.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.740
So yeah, that is all going to be next week.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:04.480
Not doing anything special guys, 9 is like a weird number and you know we thought maybe

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.560
it would be better to save something really cool for 10 years.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.320
We should open up with rum stain.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.440
We're hoping we can get like a guest or something you know to come in and have fun with us but

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.600
we're not really planning on anything like super huge.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.580
There just comes a point where celebrating too much is just too much.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:24.720
Like okay, we had a 5 year show, we had a 300, a 400, you know 9 years, whatever.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.840
So that's that.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.120
So we'll be here next week of course with that.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.200
If you wanted to wish us happy birthday, a great way to do that of course would be to

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.360
rate us on iTunes with a 5 star review because that helps other people notice the show or

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360
just spread the word.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.640
We always say at the end of the show, spread the word about the show.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640
Send a tweet.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.440
I saw somebody made a very nice Facebook post this week pointing us to the Orange Lounge

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440
Radio Facebook.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440
I thought that was great.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.280
So all that stuff always really helps.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.280
It goes a long way.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.980
During the break, Loki was asking me about why didn't I mention Child of Eden during

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.800
my gaming week because I've made it no secret on the show before.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:05.520
I'm a huge fan of Q and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, obviously the Reds, Space Channel, Luminous,

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.720
shit I even loved every extent Extra Extreme.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.700
I still say 99 Nights wasn't as bad as y'all made it out to be but maybe that's a little

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.960
bit of fanboy isn't there.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.040
But I did not play Child of Eden this week.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.000
Long story short, I was basically reminded that I had a birthday coming up and maybe

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.140
I shouldn't make any game purchases until my birthday has passed.

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:26.600
For those that don't know, my birthday happens to also be next Sunday.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.480
My birthday was 3 days after the original OLR on June 23rd.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.120
So yeah, my birthday is right around this time too.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.440
So I have to wait until then and then maybe there will be a gift card or something I can

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.120
use to go get it.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.000
But Loki and I were talking a little bit about some of the reviews and things we've heard

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.740
about the game and how some people are dog and child of Eden for being only 90 minutes.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:50.440
Now I hear it, again, I haven't played it, I can only go off what I've heard and my intense

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.400
bias towards Q and everything that Tetsuya Mizuguchi touches.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.760
But I hear it's an amazing 90 minutes.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.760
Like that it's just like a great 90 minutes a game.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.600
They said it will bring you to tears.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.880
It will bring you to tears.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.840
Well the original Rez was an amazing game too and it was probably only about 90 minutes.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.240
Now granted games didn't cost 60 bucks back then.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.560
The only thing that brings me to tears is the fact that I forgot to send in Josh's picture

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.800
when they were doing picture submissions because that would have been awesome.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.000
I didn't even realize, I forgot that was there.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.960
So I've been trying to stay spoiler free so please don't spoil or whatever.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.040
But Loki and I were kind of talking a little bit about the whole 90 minutes thing and Loki

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.160
you feel that 90 minutes, paying 60 bucks for a 90 minute experience is okay.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:39.640
Which is funny to hear from you because usually you're the first one to dog people that are

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.520
wanting to price gouge and all that stuff.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.040
But if it's a damn good 90 minutes then it might be worth the cost, right?

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040
Exactly.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.920
I mean the way I look at it is like shooters.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.280
Shooters that are out there, I'm not talking about first person shooters, I'm talking about

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.720
arcade games.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:02.360
They're not 30 hours long, they're like a few hours if that.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.720
It's a full fleshed out game.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.940
You don't need a whole lot of story with this stuff so you don't need to spend extra time

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:17.740
for story development and whatnot but if it's a good entertaining 90 minutes it's better

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.120
than a boring 6 hours or a boring 30 hours.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.680
I mean you might spend 60 bucks to go to an awesome concert.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.720
Like I probably spent over 100 bucks to go see Lady Gaga and that was a pretty awesome

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.960
90 minutes.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.200
But all joking aside, obviously reviewers are going to react differently and so forth.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.640
But see that's the thing, that's my problem with some of these reviewers nowadays, it's

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:49.320
like they kind of forgot how games were or they forgot how things are.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.800
They're like oh this isn't as good as Call of Duty so I don't like it.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.960
I don't understand that.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.420
Let me play devil's advocate a little bit here though is that the game marketplace isn't

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.680
what it used to be.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.640
And to be fair there's a lot of games out there that have intense replayability value

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.080
that go for 99 cents like Angry Birds.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.520
I understand that but at the same time you can't judge a first person shooter by the

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.240
same criteria as a music game.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.800
I mean they have different intents and purposes and I think comparing-

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.980
I thought you said it was a shooter.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:18.980
What is it?

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.240
Is it a shooter or is it a music game?

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.840
No it's not a first person shooter.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.840
That's different.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.720
You can judge first person shooters against other first person shooters and granted you

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:35.800
can judge different elements of it like this has good production value and stuff like that.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:44.560
But you can't say oh because this shooter slash music game is not like as long as Final

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.600
Fantasy 13 well I'm going to have to rate it lower or something.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.100
But see once again though it kind of- here's the way I look at it.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:18:00.520
If you're looking to reviews and reviewers for you know your decision on whether you

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.440
purchase a game or not here's what you need to do.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:09.200
You need to search out reviews for games that you like or games that you have interest in

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.960
and find the reviewers that are sharing your same dislikes or likes with these games and

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.960
when you find a reviewer that kind of thinks like you do then you'll know whether to trust

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.040
that person's opinion or not because at the end of the day you know an IGN review that's

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.640
one person's opinion that's one person's opinion that you're holding so much weight against

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:33.800
because it's IGN.com it's one dude I mean hell if I said I hate this game I hate Madden

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.960
does that mean Madden is terrible no it doesn't mean Madden is terrible means I don't like

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:42.920
Madden a perfect example Minecraft we have all said on the show we don't understand Minecraft

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.720
like I've tried to play Minecraft and I was like this is not fun for me but I looked at

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.520
it and I went I see how it's fun for someone else but like someone with more of that you

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:59.440
know creative mind that wants to build things and and so forth I was like I was I was done

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.880
with Minecraft it's like people rating movie tie-in games it's like people rating children's

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.040
games they don't fucking care because they're like I don't want to rate you know I don't

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:12.400
want to be reviewing the Green Lantern game when I could be playing you know something

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.580
way better than this and so a lot of times it seems like that that comes out it's not

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:23.960
a unbiased opinion and sometimes I think that they just dog on the game so badly because

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:30.040
it's funny and people will you know link to that article some page it's just because you

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:34.920
know such as the websites that gave Duke Nukem Forever a zero like you know I again I haven't

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.720
played Duke Nukem Forever but a zero like I don't think I can trust a website they get

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.760
I mean again I haven't played it so maybe I need to bite my tongue but I just kind of

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.000
get the sense even from the demo I played I can't possibly imagine I could trust a website

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.480
that gave Fusion Frenzy 2 a higher score than Duke Nukem Forever because Fusion Frenzy 2

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:59.520
is the worst game I've played this generation and and also you know just some once again

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:04.080
like I said it's it's all about whether Bomberman 0 I take that back Bomberman 0 is the worst

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.960
game I played this generation it's all about you know whether you agree with the person

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.240
who's reviewing stuff like there are certain video movie reviewers out there that you may

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:18.000
have you may share the same opinion with you know Roger Deibert as opposed to some other

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.880
guy you know or vice versa I mean it it's all about finding the reviewer that you know

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.840
it makes sense to you or or what you can do is instead of worrying about wasting a lot

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.260
of money you know what guess what you can go now to red box machines and you can rent

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:40.120
a game for two dollars for a night so you know what you can get a taste of the game

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.360
or you can play a demo or you can rent it at a you know traditional video rental place

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.600
or you can do it through Gamefly or wherever and you don't spend you know sixty dollars

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.360
on a game you can check it out and if you like it cool you buy it if not then you didn't

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.880
waste that much money let me get some comments from chat.orangelaunceter.com as we are taping

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.740
live on this Sunday night break man in our chat room says for 90 minutes of fun a hooker

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:05.720
would charge you a lot more money so this is actually a good deal speaking of child

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.320
of Eden that's right I did learn how to learn that from watching cat house girls is that

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:14.000
the Air Force Amy or whatever her name was would charge probably several hundred dollars

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.720
for 90 minutes of fun. I have a feeling that the people in that cat house charge a lot

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:25.800
more than your traditional hooker because they're you know in Vegas and shit but yes

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.780
no no that was that was the bunny ranch that was that's a past Reno oh my mistake well

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.080
still Nevada I mean they figure people gambling have a lot of money so we could drive to the

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:42.200
bunny ranch we should we should take your wife out to the bunny ranch someday she one

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:49.480
of her aspirations in life was to get a prostitution license at some point for for Nevada just

01:21:49.480 --> 01:22:01.480
that just to have a hard and put it you know so you know oh boy I and to read Saddam Hussein's

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:08.400
romance novels that he wrote those are two of her aspirations I think your wife needs

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.600
a podcast like not about games but I think your wife just needs a podcast called like

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:18.180
Nellie streams and every week she could talk about a dream of hers a lot of the stuff that

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:21.720
we talk about ends up on Facebook anyways especially if we say something funny like

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.520
last night I was saying something to her and to her a lot of the stuff I say sounds like

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:35.200
mumbling and so she'll say you said this or you know it's usually said you called me an

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:41.000
n-word no no that's not what I said at all I don't remember what the hell I actually

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.680
said it was not even close all right let's move on we're gonna get to some rapid fire

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.280
news but first we always like to plug the other projects if you enjoy Orange Lounge

01:22:52.280 --> 01:23:00.600

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:14.400
Tara and Dan Jeddo and I saw some of you in chat saying that I'm dogging on Warcraft which

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.200
I don't think I am really but then on the other token I turn around and I play World

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:23.000
of Warcraft which isn't for everyone and that's fine I understand that game isn't for everyone

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.680
but if you think it might be for you or it is for you you should check out the best little

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:32.680
Horde house in Azeroth Hordehouse.com that's the show I do with Xtaphir about the World

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.560
of Warcraft it's put out every week except last week because I was doing double duty

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.440
here for E3 but we did come back with episode 29 this week and it was a lot of fun talking

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:47.080
about the upcoming patch that still has not come out that may not come out on Tuesday

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:53.240
after all the lots of WoW stuff and Warcraft discussion going on there Hordehouse.com alright

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.520
let's move on and get into some rapid fire news lots of new gaming stories throughout

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.920
the week we don't always have time to spend five minutes on all of them let's talk quickly

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.000
about some of the things you might otherwise miss Loki so EA is trying something out they

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.200
decided to open a retail store for EA Sports in the Charlotte Airport and of course you

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:17.200
know if you've been to airports they have a lot of stores you can waste money and time

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.280
in because you know people are waiting for their flights especially when they're told

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.720
to get to the airports you know three hours early or two hours early and oh guess what

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.520
that security line wasn't as long as they said it was and now you have to hang around

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.120
and maybe you need some gifts for your friends and whatnot so they're going to be doing that

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:41.440
and I guess kind of as a test to see if this is something that would take off other places

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.080
I don't know it's a neat idea but I don't think you're going to see this really anywhere

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:53.880
else because you know everybody carries EA Sports stuff so I don't know but I mean those

01:24:53.880 --> 01:25:01.100
theme type stores are pretty popular in airports so makes sense now this is kind of interesting

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:05.920
never thought I would see a sequel to this game but apparently Namco is doing a new Namco

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:12.000
Generations game and that game is Dancing Eyes and Dancing Eyes was an arcade game it

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.120
came out I think in the 2000s is basically kind of I think it was based on like the Playstation

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:24.600
1 or something like that but it was a 3D poly kind of a almost like a gals panic or kicks

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:30.640
type game you had a grid that was around usually a woman or it could be something funny and

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.840
as you you know connected the dots or connected the lines around a shape that shape would

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.840
disappear and reveal either the scantily clad woman underneath or you know in some cases

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:48.640
a cow or a person or who knows titties no there were there was no nudity in any of these

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:53.640
games but after you did get done though you got the they played the you know the kind

01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:02.480
of burlesque horn music or whatever oh it's like Sharon Christine Aguilera something like

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:09.920
that and so they're going to be putting out a new game now for the Namco Generations he

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.560
used to play this game at Arcade Infinity actually I did play this and I actually have

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.600
it on my arcade cabinet at home I played I've played it in MAME and it's fun it's it's it's

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:28.280
not you know it's not an adult game I mean it's sort of could I guess it's it's PG-13

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:35.520
yeah I mean you reveal like women wearing bikinis or you know a girl dressed up like

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.880
a cat you know a cat girl or something oh my gosh not a cat girl you're playing as a

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:46.520
monkey and you run around you're trying to avoid you know different enemies that are

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.760
running around the screen stuff so you're supposed to dodge them and they actually have

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.880
some screenshots here see it's basically just you know running around like a woman's you

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:03.200
know shirt and it's revealing her bra underneath so that's coming out in PlayStation 3 oh 96

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:11.960
is when it came out in the arcade that was 2000 but neat also they're going to be doing

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:21.760
a game of or a new version of Metro Cross as Arrow Cross I guess so that's kind of neat

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.360
and then finally I guess this is good news for people that are looking for a new Psychonauts

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:34.880
game but Double Fine is now obtaining the rights to publish a new Psychonauts game and

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:42.560
of course you know it came out back in 05 and Tim Schafer you know says Double Fine's

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.120
always owned the intellectual property rights for Psychonauts franchise but we've and we

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:53.380
so we've been free to pursue movies sequels etc says what changed recently is the publishing

01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:57.960
rights to the game Psychonauts have reverted to Double Fine and some of the deals still

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.760
need to be finalized this means anything financially when that happens we'll have more to announce

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:12.880
so all right neat well moving on to Xbox Live you might have caught the indie games uprising

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.600
last winter it was a way for the indie games on Xbox Live to get more exposure in fact

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.560
there was a little bit of back and forth because it was something that the community kind of

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:25.200
came up with the Microsoft at first didn't really support it but they finally came around

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.480
and they did kind of give it some ad space and so forth calling attention to it well

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.960
it's coming back for the summer it's going to start on August 22nd and run through September

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:39.840
12th two games will be released each week and it's all going to be based on votes starting

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:45.520
July 4th you can vote on what titles you believe should be featured obviously a big problem

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.880
with Xbox Live marketplace in the indie game section is that it's really hard to get noticed

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:54.560
on there right now so this will be a way to get visibility for some of those games so

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.640
we'll see what happens there submissions if you think if you are an indie developer you

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.520
know an indie developer that might want to get in on this you can submit through June

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.600
24th so that's not very much more time so you might want to get on that moving on speaking

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.040
of Xbox one of the big things that was shown at the Microsoft press conference this year

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:20.200
was the fabled the journey demonstration well a very interesting quote from Peter Molyneux

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:27.440
this week about it this was in an interview with official Xbox magazine quote I made a

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.480
horrendous mistake on the press demo in taking out the navigation allowing players to move

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:39.640
I'll state on record now that fable the journey is definitely not on rails and there's this

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.560
whole thing where there's I guess he met with all these journalists and he made them sign

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:52.120
the board for it said it is not on rails and all this stuff so a horrendous mistake and

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:56.940
I have to agree they made a huge mistake not showing that you could navigate it did look

01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:04.520
like rails so they should have said something about that but who knows we'll see more about

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.200
this when it gets a little closer to release by the way the reason why they did what they

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.920
did they wanted to showcase the game's action like using the magic attacks and the whole

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:18.640
horse and carriage and all that stuff because the unreal or the non on rails part wasn't

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.160
finished yet one of the other big pieces to come out of e3 was that you're gonna get a

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:29.280
free game if you have a 3ds you're gonna get the four swords the Legend of Zelda four swords

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.120
that is going to be coming out for free a little later this year it's supposed to be

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.160
out in September according to Nintendo well just to clarify it did come out this week

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.760
that the version you're going to be getting is the Game Boy Advance version because there's

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:48.040
no real way to do the GameCube emulation I'm assuming on the 3ds right now the Game Boy

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:53.000
Advance version is the version that you will be able to get on the 3ds no word yet about

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.320
if it's going to be enhanced at all kind of like excite bike had very minimal thrills

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.660
to kind of enhance it for widescreen and so forth no word if that's going to be given

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:07.320
the same treatment for Zelda for four swords or possibly even maybe online that might just

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.840
be wishful thinking I don't know but it is the Game Boy Advance version that you're gonna

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:16.720
get for free later this year and I guess free is not such a bad deal unless it's yours dark

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.160
soccer you have some rapid fire stuff for us I do for portal to there's some download

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:27.480
content coming out this is the six cents motion pack but it only works with the razor hydro

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:32.440
motion controller you can actually get the pack of course through steam you can get the

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.720
controller through steam as well as 140 bucks but it comes with a copy of portal 2 and a

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:44.600
download content of course if you already have portal 2 then you have a gift for a friend

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:51.020
then in other news there is the Super Mario Brothers 3 fan remake I think we've covered

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:57.200
it before but there's a 2 version 2.0 out that has much better improved graphics especially

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:05.360
in the background and 84 bonus rooms a new final castle and 30 different cameos so there's

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:11.760
a footage of it up on YouTube if you go find it it's Super Mario Brothers 3 version 2.0

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.320
and then I actually watched some of the video and it does look really nice by the way and

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:24.000
then Sony is offering six months of curiosity for ps3 owners basically you sign up for their

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:33.680
little demo of the service and you can get a music unlimited option and then you can

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:39.440
listen to whatever songs you want to pretty cool that's pretty cool as long as it doesn't

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:45.280
roll into like a subscription or something like that well that yeah I would decide but

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.280
I mean I know they were very careful about PlayStation Plus where they did go out of

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.080
their way to say you once the 30-day trial is up in the welcome back program once the

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.640
30-day trial is up you will not be charged at all I mean it's it's yeah I'm actually

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:03.920
I'm trying to get it I have to download my games and stuff but right now we don't have

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:09.000
remember my my ps3 doesn't have wireless internet keep in mind you only have till July something

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.080
I know that it's July 3rd I'm probably gonna do this week but uh you know I've been have

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:22.040
to drag an ethernet cable out to the front room is not very fun all right let's get to

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:26.220
the Twitter topics I've actually before I get there I've actually been purposely waiting

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:30.840
on the PlayStation Plus I'm waiting till right before the last day because if it is a 30-day

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:35.840
trial either something's got to come out real soon that makes me want to get it like now

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.360
to get the discount or whatever or I'm gonna wait and see you know cuz see if they maybe

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.080
start putting on some real good stuff after it's not free anymore you know I mean for

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.000
most people that went in and jumped in day one we'll see I don't know maybe it'll pay

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.120
off maybe not let's move into some Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr every week you

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:57.560
show us your tweets and we read them here on air why because we're the show where every

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:02.680
gamer has a voice JV Mon sent us a string of tweets to start us off today that basically

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:06.720
he went to Nintendo World and said there's a huge line for Zelda I didn't even realize

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.320
they were showing that today but they were of course this is New York City he says it

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.000
easily goes down at least a block and a half before they start letting people in and even

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.020
send a little picture I guess these are people like going into the store cuz from this picture

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:23.760
it doesn't look very long but the lines going like the other way but yeah looks like you're

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:29.480
huge crowds out there today and he says the one time I forgot the 3ds at home like everyone

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:35.680
has them you get a street pass like a hundred people over at that event crazy let's see

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.440
also some other tweets Warrior Bob had tweeted I just realized I've been listening to olr

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.880
for like seven years holy carb yeah some of our listeners have been listening a long time

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.000
so thank you to all you of course the listeners we wouldn't be here for more finger support

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.960
whether you just started listening this week or you've been there since episode one which

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.880
would be very few of you because I think we had 12 people listening that week but thank

01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.400
you to you guys who supported us from whatever time over the years Defective Candy sent us

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:11.360
a tweet with a story from CNN average age of a gamer goes up and CNN had reported here

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.800
I guess they were reporting about this 37 year old that you know now that I'm gonna

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.600
be 33 pretty soon 37 does not seem that old at all in a row so I'm just kind of surprised

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:27.440
they're talking about this whole thing like gamers are getting older I think just a lot

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.360
of us grew up on games and haven't stopped because we just accepted as a part of our

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:38.280
lives whereas I think back when the original Nintendo came out maybe 37 year olds at the

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.720
time didn't get it quote unquote so I don't know but anyway they were talking about this

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:48.040
whole thing about how gamers are getting older blah blah blah blockbuster games the social

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.360
games and so on and so on yeah gamers are getting older because I think they just haven't

01:35:53.360 --> 01:36:00.320
left stuck with them dark Tetsuya says that he is plugging his first round of where are

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.240
they now interviews I guess some of the people he's mentioned some of the people is going

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.520
to be interviewing Jessica Harper is going to be in one of the where are they now interviews

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:14.280
virtually who you might remember he was the guy that was famous for passing max 300 back

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.800
in the day and rice used to be in our chat room all the time remember that kid all the

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.060
time back when we were on life is five so dark Tetsuya has like dug out all these old

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.680
school people from the past is going to be running features on the site so especially

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.280
if you were into the money culture back in the day it sounds like he's found a lot of

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.080
those people if you're not so much into the money culture then it's interviews with gamers

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.200
but you'll be I think it'd be neat to see the roots of where we came from although if

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:44.320
you can't tell where Jessica Harper is you know we know where she is yeah Jessica Harper

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.000
of course is on Saturday nights on all games radio on her own show with Travis Donovan

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.640
why are you guys listening that's right so yeah I could tell you where she is now but

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.320
I'm sure there'll be some other little tidbits in there maybe she'll talk about how it was

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.160
to have DDR freak in orange launch radio kind of coexisting because it was an interesting

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.120
history we talked about it when she was here for the first time on the show if you didn't

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:11.400
listen you'll just have to go find that episode all right anyhow type classes a few tweets

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:16.600
one of them is about I don't think this comes up later in the show so I apologize if I'm

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.320
stealing someone's story the tiger claw posted but I guess this had to do something um what

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.160
was this electronic arts no we definitely don't have this on the list tonight electronic

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:35.040
arts had a gun in the godfather games called the Dillinger and back in 2009 the grandson

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.960
of Dillinger's half-sister threatened to sue EA unless they paid him millions of dollars

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:47.160
wow that's kind of sad well a judge in Indiana this week said that the Dillinger descendant

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:52.640
is not entitled to any money there is an Indiana law regarding a person's publicity right it

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.320
was enacted after Dillinger died so sorry totally sounds like a cash grab thing against

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:06.000
a big corporation and he got basically laughed out of court everybody point and laugh hahaha

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.520
tiger claw links us one more story Miyamoto has said that virtual boy games on the 3ds

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:16.920
it could happen I guess wherever there's money to be made right it was in an interview with

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:22.800
game spot saying quote for Miyamoto well that's not my exact plan but something like that

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:28.640
could happen I can say that in my photo album on my Nintendo 3ds there is a photo of a virtual

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:35.320
boy so that says I do have a virtual boy at my disposal laughs only 14 games were ever

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:41.440
released in the West virtual boy color yeah I think it would be interesting to see them

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:46.480
visit some of those games they weren't terrible per se I mean they would be good what are

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.560
they charging for those three bucks I think they'd be good three dollar games yeah you

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.720
know like the Mario game nice to see them redone in color I think red I think it would

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.720
be neat to see them redo that but we'll see and hopefully this time they won't give us

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:05.960
migraines but we'll see that was the worst we'll see that does it for the twitter topics

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:12.580
night twitter.com slash olr say hi to us throughout the week more news stories mailbag soon skype

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:20.040
line after that we still have plenty more to cover so let's go to Loki ah yes so apparently

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.480
you know the long talked about connect for windows software development kit has finally

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:33.320
been released released the beta has and of course they have you know the versions available

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:38.280
for 32-bit and 64-bit and requires windows 7 and I guess it's for non-commercial use

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:46.440
so right now you can you know homebrew developers can make their own connect hacks or whatever

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:53.040
and show them off and one way may be able to show them off is actually in this new vote

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:59.880
for the next connect hack to become a connect fun labs toy they have voting up right now

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:09.960
for a few different hacks six well-known ones I guess the apps in question keyboard anywhere

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:15.800
it's basically like the keyboard from big you know or the floor keyboard where you can

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:21.320
play just by stepping around the ground virtual conductor which would be kind of similar to

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:28.760
like we music the conductor in that connect body art would basically take pictures of

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.560
you as you're moving around and you can kind of layer yourself throughout there they have

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:42.600
a really weird kind of hippie video for that hand puppets was shown off they had like a

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.760
bird hand puppet has been projected onto the wall that someone is manipulating with their

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.920
arm and when the camera saw you move your hand it would move the puppet as well so it's

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:58.680
kind of cool digital pin art which is like those pin art devices where you can kind of

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.560
make your hand imprint stuff like that they have that and then music visualizer which

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.880
would be kind of just like it sounds something you play music to and it kind of makes these

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:16.520
waveforms appear all throughout your room so those are all right now you can vote on

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:24.120
those on connect share.com and have you played connect fun labs yet no it's so dopey like

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.400
it is it's really one of those things is fun for five minutes and you're like oh okay but

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.100
it's real yeah it's free can't complain free achievement points if you're into that sort

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:37.760
of thing but I it's really the type of thing I think a bunch of people would get drunk

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.600
and have a lot of fun making the little mini movies like you know the one I did at the

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.720
Sailor Moon that was like you know I'll kill you and all that stuff but I don't know a

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.880
lot of it's kind of okay I would be with a keyboard thing to come out though that look

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:57.120
it needs to be longer than 15 seconds yeah they need to let you do more with that alright

01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.680
anyhow moving on to one of the other announcements out of E3 was that there is a Silent Hill

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:08.400
collection coming not just a Metal Gear but a game that's dear to us the Silent Hill series

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.440
is getting an HD collection but here's the catch it's only on PlayStation 3 it will only

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.760
include Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 but there will be new high definition graphics

01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:24.600
so right now it's a PlayStation 3 exclusive according to the producer Tom Hewlett quote

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.960
it's always been a primarily Sony platform series so right now we're just aiming at a

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.600
Sony exclusive which isn't to say that in the future it won't be available anywhere

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:38.380
else but right now it's a Sony exclusive they are looking at a fall 2011 release by the

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:43.760
way there is all new voice acting in this game as well it is being directed by Mary

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:50.080
Elizabeth McGlynn and so there's a new actor that's going to be in the series let's see

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:58.400
and I think a lot of this is because the other actor James Sunderland doesn't have such kind

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:02.400
things to say about his participation I'm sorry the guy who played James Sunderland

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:08.600
guy see he quote Konami knows that they owe me residuals for all previous unauthorized

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.420
reuses of my mocap and virtual performances it would appear Konami is seeking to avoid

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:18.640
further liability by changing the voice of their latest reuse of the Silent Hill 2 materials

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.560
however if any of my mocap appears in the new release Konami will be liable for unauthorized

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:29.800
reuse of my performance yikes I'll get around to seeking compensation through the courts

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.520
one of these days I simply don't have the time for it right now I hope this doesn't

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.840
burn out any fans it's just business as usual on the production side of games yikes so it

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:43.760
sounds like we might have the real reason why all new voice acting is coming to the

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:50.600
game anyhow one other thing I want to put out you know there is the Silent Hill downpour

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:55.040
game coming out soon which I don't know I think the shark might have been jumped on

01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:01.240
Silent Hill we might be kind of be done with it and if we weren't if this wasn't the nail

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:07.600
in the coffin the game's soundtrack of course no longer by Akira Moka it's by Dan Licht

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:17.440
who did the music for Dexter the theme song is being written by Korn the metal band yes

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:23.320
that's right Korn is doing the theme song to the game hey remember the 90s you guys

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.520
weren't they awesome you know though I have to listen to the actual song first because

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.840
you know just because it's done by Korn doesn't mean it's going to be terrible there's a very

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:36.840
good likelihood that it's going to be terrible but you know there's some artists out there

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:42.040
that can do scores that aren't they aren't terrible but then again this is Korn so it's

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:45.200
not scoring it they're just doing the theme song well it's also though if you want to

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.580
look at versatility I mean Daft Punk did do the entire Tron Legacy soundtrack and it was

01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:53.400
quite different than their usual stuff true but when that was announced everybody said

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:59.720
that's fucking awesome and that makes sense but Korn doing Silent Hills is kind of like

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:06.200
do not want like the guy doing the guy that did Dexter the score for Dexter doing the

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.560
score for this game I don't think it's gonna be that bad I think that would be yeah I think

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:14.280
that'd be all right I mean the reality is Akira Moka is moved on he's doing something

01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:20.240
else now you're not gonna have that yeah so he's doing something else that's for sure

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:26.320
and speaking of Neon Genesis even the music game yeah yeah I heard about that that's not

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:33.600
as big project though no no no it's just weird yeah so we'll see what happens with the Korn

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.760
theme song hey some of you still some of you still love your Korn so maybe it'll be a great

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.400
thing I just don't when I think of Silent Hill and what bands would go good with that

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:48.000
I don't think a Korn I don't know pendulum Alan Wake had a pretty badass soundtrack actually

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.480
but they used a lot of old songs there was a Poe song on there Poe hasn't put out an

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:58.200
album since 98 I love Poe dude whatever songs like it just I was playing Alan Wake and like

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:02.520
chapter 2 or chapter 3 closes with a Poe song like it came out of nowhere I was like which

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.620
one it's fucking Poe haunted oh I know it's like a great song I was like oh my god this

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:12.560
game has Poe this is great here's something random Alan Wake has probably been in development

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.680
since 98 but yeah here's something random is that almost every CD that I've burned except

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.860
for my very last one has trigger happy jack on it can't talk to a psycho like a normal

01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:29.000
human being yeah that's a great fucking love Poe however she needs to just put out a new

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.600
album get over all this I was abused by my record label show me on the doll where the

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:38.720
record label touched you I mean just I'm kind of over all that anyway Loki we'll save that

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.760
for a different podcast that's hilarious well how how about some Nintendo news how about

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:50.900
some Nintendo news well Mario Kart 3d is supposedly gonna have eight player local wireless racing

01:46:50.900 --> 01:47:00.780
if it goes to plan and eight player online as well so basically Hideki Kono said that

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:06.480
it would have online play and they just weren't sure what exactly the configuration was but

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:13.840
that the goal is that you could have eight players both in local wireless and over Wi-Fi

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.760
so they also said that should be able to handle 60 frames per second with eight players in

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:26.280
both online offline 2d and 3d it's pretty cool and then in addition to that is red flare

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:35.760
3ds Japan is gonna be getting a bright red one with a looks like it's black on the inside

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:47.640
top cover and they actually put out some press about that around the e3 time and that it

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:54.200
looks like it's gonna they're also with new we bundles there's gonna be on June 23rd we

01:47:54.200 --> 01:48:03.480
sports resort and a we remote plus in the same color as console it should be about 250

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:11.280
bucks or 20,000 yen the red DS looks red 3ds excuse me looks kind of cool I gotta say it's

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.540
a pretty awesome color if they'd had that at launch I would have got that color think

01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:21.300
of an old Famicom yep although it is weird to me how the top screen doesn't change colors

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:26.040
I mean I guess it's part of the whole 3d effect thing I think I read somewhere that they can't

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:32.520
change colors because it would harm the 3d effect but whatever what I can see that because

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:38.560
your frame colors are gonna affect your perception that's why I like for some reason like displaying

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:44.340
most art is good on a room with a light pink wall okay well I understand that you can't

01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:48.840
change the frame around the actual you know system but I mean they can change at least

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:53.280
the outside could all be one cuz I seem to remember the lid is still I don't know I haven't

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:58.400
it's mine is black so it doesn't really matter it is they do have like three different colors

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.480
on there three different shades of a color and so I they can do it but yeah yeah I don't

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.880
know the black around the outsides I put a link to the image in the chat room all right

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.280
all right well let's move on with some more news yeah it's not it's not too terrible but

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:18.640
anyways um so other fun stuff here I'm gonna talk a little bit about Nintendo and the Wii

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:24.680
U again and of course one things that people are asking because it's somewhat popular to

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:30.920
have some free to play games on different platforms Nintendo is not interested in freemium

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:38.940
games and saying that it hurts the value of games it says that's because I myself am one

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:43.160
of the game developers who in the future wants to make efforts so that the value of software

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:48.260
would be appreciated by the consumers it says although freemium games can make money through

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:54.020
ads and microtransactions they expressing concern about destroying the value of the

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:59.200
game software once again I think it's all because they want to sell virtual console

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:06.480
games for $5 versus 99 cents that you can get for a great game on some other platforms

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:11.460
like Android and the iOS and stuff like that not to say that all 99 cent games that come

01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:14.680
out on those are very good speaking of which I just want to throw out there there's a big

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:20.800
sale going on this weekend on for for games for 99 cents on iOS and it's the company game

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.480
loft which you know they're a little because they they kind of rip off games but they they

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:29.720
do a pretty decent job from what I understand of ripping off games so I just bought two

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.360
of them because all the games are 99 cents right now I bought order in chaos which is

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.520
their Wow clone on the phone and I hear it's it's definitely not Wow but for an iPhone

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.320
it is kind of impressive and then eternal legacy which try to guess what it's a clone

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.600
of just from the little icon I already know it's literally I'll show it to dark soccer

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.880
in the bottom right hand corner there on my phone I just I just downloaded it while I'm

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:56.680
here would who does that look like to you yeah who did tell listeners who's that look

01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:03.700
like very cloud yeah it's it's a Final Fantasy 7 rip off but they're 99 cents so I and I

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:07.880
hear they're good rip off so we'll see I'll tell you about those next week but anyway

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:13.280
sorry to deviate from the story so what's that mean exactly cuz Ghost Recon online is

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:19.800
a free play to game on a PC and it's gonna be on the Wii U well expect it not to be free

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:26.560
to play so that's kind of unfortunate also it's very long you know it's very far away

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:33.600
so maybe they'll change their mind but I don't know it's just Nintendo be Nintendo whatever

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:42.080
and of course you know people were hoping that you know because the Zelda 25th anniversary

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:46.640
is happening right now that maybe Nintendo's gonna do something cool like they did with

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.960
you know well I wouldn't exactly call it cool because all they did was port a fucking Super

01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.200
Nintendo game to the Wii but they're hoping that there would be some sort of Legend of

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:58.440
Zelda anthology or something like that that would come out with you know all the Zelda

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:06.720
games you know on a disc or something and of course they said no they're not gonna do

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:13.640
that because they don't want to do the same thing two years in a row that was their excuse

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:21.040
they don't want to do the same thing two years in a row ah Nintendo you just make it too

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.480
damn easy you don't want to do the same thing two years around like re-release all these

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:33.560
old-ass games and you know mark them as new or I don't know it wasn't like Mario Galaxy

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:40.160
Mario Galaxy to release not too far apart I mean you know that's within two years about

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.760
new Super Mario Brothers we and New Super Mario Brothers me yeah they don't want to

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:48.300
do they're getting these not a game no no here's what they want to do they want to release

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:53.080
all that shit on a virtual console or you know for the 3ds or something charge you you

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:56.960
know separately for everything in my opinion they kind of already did it back on the Game

01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:04.520
Cube too yeah they did it on the Game Cube as a pre-order bonus come on if that was awesome

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.980
see that's how you treat your customers by offering them something really fucking awesome

01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:15.280
for ordering Wind Waker which I still think is a pretty awesome game but they just don't

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:20.720
want to do that they don't want to do it so whatever and you know what they're gonna do

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:27.400
I will bet you money you see cuz that that wonderful Wii U doesn't play Game Cube games

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:33.680
so that means it's time to do some more of those so was it virtual console Game Boy Game

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:39.920
Cube games it's no more the new play motion games remember how they had that for a while

01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:44.840
where they're gonna take old-ass Game Cube games yeah like Peekman straight port them

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:50.560
over with Wii controls mm-hmm yeah that's what they're gonna do good times hey as long

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:55.520
as f-zero is one of those games because I'm kind of pissed that I didn't hear about a

01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:02.720
new f-zero but I guess it was just dreaming anyway all right moving on to another story

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:07.340
isn't f-zero 64 right yeah but that's already on virtual console that's been all you know

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:13.920
what they're gonna do their import that shit the 3ds oh my god moving on this was a kind

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.060
of interesting story from the weekend it's about Duke Nukem Forever and it has to do

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.880
with those negative reviews and so forth I don't know if you heard about what happened

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:28.560
but on Twitter this gentleman named James Redner he is the founder of the Redner group

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:34.920
who was representing 2k games and was representing some of the games like Duke Nukem Forever

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:40.640
and so forth he actually put a tweet out that said too many went far with their reviews

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:45.380
we are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's venom he

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:50.960
followed it with bad scores are fine venom-filled reviews that's completely different he did

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.760
follow up his I don't know he was probably high or drunk when he did it he deleted the

01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:59.260
tweets and then apologized saying that he was just acting under emotions he was just

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.960
being very emotional and his panties were very bunched and he wrote those tweets in

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.800
anger but 2k games sacked him they said 2k games does not endorse the comments made by

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.680
Jim Redner and we can confirm that the render group no longer report represents our products

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:18.960
that was a very public bitch-slapping of that but you know this is one of those things that's

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.960
not a very big secret that seems to go on in the industry and it's this very interesting

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:28.100
game of chicken that goes on between the big media sites and these you know people that

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:33.080
represent the publishers is the publishers will send games out early but there's always

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:37.540
kind of that expectation of well are you gonna print a good review and we've heard these

01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:42.000
stories about embargoes that are allowed to be lifted only if you give the game a good

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.400
review and you know you can get a sneak peek at this game if you gave such and such game

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.880
a good review I mean it's shady shit that happens and that's why we tell you you know

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.720
a lot of times the the reviews that you trust most come from the indie sites that are buying

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.680
these games themselves and not going through these PR agencies I'm not I'm not knocking

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.160
all PR agencies because some of them do really great things and they do really help out and

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.280
get questions answered and so forth but unfortunately there's a lot of shady shit that happens out

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.940
there and if you don't think this happens on a big website that you like to read a lot

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:24.400
between that website and the agency you're you're really lying to yourself you know this

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:29.880
this is just a part of the industry I remember very vividly we went to a particular company's

01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:36.000
thing and had to sign things saying we would not report on anything until I think it was

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.640
like the Monday after or something like that sure enough the Sunday night before all the

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:48.000
big websites got to leak some stories it was kind of shady so each got one so what you

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.760
do in that kind of case is you just start you know you quote them as the source I know

01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.200
it's you just quote them as the source but then it's like you know you're sending people

01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.000
back to the big websites and not anybody's supposed to start necessarily like for example

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.880
there was a story I read this week that went back about three different websites and people

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.680
kept quoting the one that was quoting the other one that was quoting the other one so

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:14.980
you know you can do that all right let's get to the mailbag every week at orange launch

01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:20.360
radio we welcome your emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com we're going to dive into

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.920
the email bag head first and read your emails dark soccer wants to set it out tonight because

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.100
she's going to be nursing her throat with some tea so she doesn't cough and die on air

01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:32.120
so I'm going to read some emails tonight and we're going to start with a couple here from

01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:37.000
holly d holly d and chat says are you guys going to make an orange lounge guild for rift

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.400
like you did with wow if so let us know the shard nothing official from my standpoint

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.400
I actually let my rift subscription lapse sorry it's just I didn't want to pay for multiple

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:52.320
games at once so I might go back to it later like if there's a really cool expansion or

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:59.960
something but I let it lapse so I don't know if there's enough rift people out there then

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.560
by all means we should start something but I don't know if we have a lot of olr listeners

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.400
playing rift we'll have to see ask on the forums that'd be a good place to check that

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:15.500
out orange launch radio.com holly sends us another email about sony and more hacks going

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:20.960
on so apparently being hacked once writes holly and taking the network down then again

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.600
then on a different website compromising millions of accounts it has happened again this time

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:31.520
it was not customer information but the entirety of the source code for the psn network how

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:36.280
sony never fixed the original vulnerability everyone waited for four weeks for psn to

01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:41.080
come back for nothing that's not good that that leaked I'm not just sure if this level

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:45.800
of idiocy can be covered by the phrase monumental stupidity but I'm sure it's a start and we

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:51.520
get linked to a website uh she links us to a story from jupiter broadcasting.com which

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:59.760
I don't think I've ever heard of yeah let's see a hacker group got into hacking sony on

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:05.120
june 6th and they leaked the source court code to the sony psn developers network and

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:09.440
that could allow people to find more flaws with the sony system very quickly it could

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:14.560
also open up a private psn network they got all the source code and of course this was

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:18.760
all happening you know after sony was supposed to be fixed they were they used the hacker

01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:24.320
group used a sql injection attack against sony pictures they got 150 000 records from

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:34.860
the database of more than 4.5 million records wow hackers gonna hack not that that makes

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:39.720
it right but uh again change of passwords use them um use different passwords on different

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:48.840
websites uh going to an email now from who's this from janai dear olr i found a horror

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:54.400
point-and-click game on the xbox live indie game section called decay i can describe it

01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:01.200
as deja vu meets silent hill in an atmospheric way there are three episodes costing 240 microsoft

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:05.360
points each i think it is a highly polished game for an indie developer i would like to

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:08.760
hear your comments on this game and then he links us to the official site well i haven't

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:13.440
played the game yet but it looks like you can get more info at decay dot shining dash

gate dot se please note that is not a dot com it's dot se and uh yeah there's this whole

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.680
little trailer on the website for the game that is auto playing boo hiss i hate that

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.640
but apparently yeah it's this whole little point and click adventure game i haven't checked

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:32.880
it out i will have to take a look i like the idea of more point and click adventure games

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:40.320
on uh yeah it looks like there's part two part three part four is the final part that's

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:50.040

02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:01.160
videos using cutscenes from video games and i'm having trouble finding a download site

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.880
that uses the right kind of codec that works on windows movie maker it says that it's an

02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.340
unregistered file hey loki you're good with movies right you should listen to this i make

02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:13.600
movies using i'm sorry i make music videos using cutscenes for video games i'm having

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.160
trouble finding a download site that has the right kind of codec that works on windows

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:21.740
movie maker so if you three or the chat could help in directing me to that area i would

02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:27.000
be grateful i'm looking for bayonetta cutscenes preferably how do you get cutscenes that you

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.640
can use in windows movie maker um i don't remember what exactly windows movie maker

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:36.700
uses i'm sure it's just windows media stuff i mean it's all about having the correct codex

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:42.360
on your system um on your pc so just download some of the community codec packs and stuff

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:47.680
like that and hopefully that'll work you can even dump youtubes to movie files right can't

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.520
you uh it's not the best quality you can if you have the right real player i use real

02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.000
player to download them offline whoa real player still exists yeah actually a real player

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:05.240
has a download thing that'll convert it to mp4 or anything damn real players i used to

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:10.160
use to watch episodes of downloaded south park in like 98 or just like you know looking

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.140
for like some sort of universal file converters and stuff like that see if you can find anything

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:20.000
that it's meant for that because uh i've really i honestly don't use movie maker i use adobe

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.120
premiere so that usually doesn't have a problem opening anything here's some comments from

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:27.920
our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com scott pilgrim says there's your problem you

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:33.680
use windows movie maker but download the k-lite codec pack that should help uh frisbee says

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:41.280
get a linux distro and use kden live uh and sha100mat even uh backs it up saying download

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:46.680
something other than windows movie maker frisbee says or open shot uh it might that might be

02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:49.480
tough because windows movie maker might be the program you're comfortable with but there

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.800
are other alternatives out there um basically the same i mean there's a little bit of a

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.160
learning curve but like for example premiere like when i first started using like what

02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:00.720
the hell am i doing and then now i i kind of am a little bit more comfortable with it

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:06.120
now that i've used it for a while movie maker i tried using one time and i don't know it

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:11.320
it's a little too basic um we use adobe audition actually to produce the podcast and uh at

02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.800
first it can look really overwhelming because there's all these features that you know for

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.280
a podcast you don't really need but all the you know sound uh the opening that you hear

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:25.200
was was kind of mixed together and audition you know so adobe products are pretty good

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:29.540
anyhow let's go on to the rest of the email here from jose osumu regala also i would like

02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:35.040
to chime in with the new gimmicky systems announced at e3 both have really lame names

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.960
who who in their right minds came up with vita and weu shame on you sony nintendo we

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.120
saw this coming well thanks for reading my humble little you know vita i'm not too it's

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:52.400
a weird name but they also have the sony vio and you know that works i like the psv that

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:56.720
comes out of that i think that's might have been something they were going for but i only

02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:02.060
had to do was like place psp2 why why is it it got to be something fancy like the vita

02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:05.860
see i think that with that whole back thing they could have called it the the playstation

02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:13.880
touch and then it could be the past think about it it'd be clever looking for group

02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.720
buried and hold pst or the uh the p the playstation to reach around because you can reach around

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:26.280
the back that would have been awesome on the back uh weu is definitely one that's getting

02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.320
a lot of like you know a lot of people have made the joke about i thought it was a university

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:35.680
for mario you know things like that but uh you know you gotta go well everybody everybody

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:45.920
made fun of we when it first came out so again let's see the games to back up the name although

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.560
it was a weird that weu does not give that control like i don't think of that controller

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:56.320
when i hear weu like i get what they were trying to go for is that well it wasn't really

02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:01.600
about one person it was a part basically saying the we is a big party game system and we wanted

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:04.640
to make a system that wouldn't just be about party games that's that's kind of what i took

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:13.720
away from what reggie was saying but uh weu weird yeah weird weird all right uh moving

02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:21.640
on with some other emails speaking of weu we have an email from rob who likes to email

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:25.980
us a lot and we like reading his emails i let the weu and subsequent chatter in the

02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:30.680
back of my brain for a while and here's a few things that fell out number one weu like

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:35.680
michael patcher said is the dumbest name ever of course it is the most memorable memorable

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:41.480
name ever too it won't hurt the sales two weu is in danger by revealing its hand too

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.160
soon the ps vita could do the same thing for the ps3 if they want to steal the idea i'm

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:51.980
with you there rob above because the psp remember in 2006 they were showing the ridge racer

02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:57.440
with rear view mirror uh also if the ipad had a working controller pad doc similar to

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:02.320
the weu tablet it could instantly steal the idea and look you can play your games anywhere

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:06.560
you want instead of being stuck at home the ipad 2 can already do that didn't i see a

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:10.200
story this week about some racing game that was being played through the apple tv unit

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:14.280
well they had that for a while where they're doing that and you could basically it was

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:20.280
real racing to hd and you can do that through the hdmi and uh use the tablet as like a map

02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:23.760
and stuff so you can do that already and i mean that may be a way that they're going

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:27.660
to combat this stuff especially especially if they decide hey later on that we're going

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:34.320
to go ahead and you know put out apple tv that plays games then they're going to have

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:39.620
you know you're going to control stuff with your ipod or whatever and ipad and you may

02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:44.880
have that similar type of stuff so i don't know and one more thing michael patcher thought

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:50.080
vita was the second worst name for a system i disagree since vita has meaning in and of

02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:54.920
itself i need to give sony credit for it in fact his analysis of nintendo and sony indicate

02:06:54.920 --> 02:07:00.520
a bias towards sony not backed up by history look ma i'm a video game analyst ra baba ps

02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:04.160
i really hope the vita doesn't get the name of vita max i hope they start calling it vita

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.920
vita magic bedroom that's just me uh well i mean this patcher guy you could look at

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:12.940
him the same way we talked about reviewers earlier in the show i bet a lot of you guys

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:16.480
listen to us every week because you know we're the show where every gamer has a voice but

02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.800
we're the three that you hear every week and you probably keep listening to us because

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:24.840
you kind of like what we have to say you know in our analysis i mean we we joke about it

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.400
on the show sometimes that we're also video game analyst or as i say video game analysts

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:33.320
but uh it's it's sort of true i think you guys tuned into the show because you like

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:38.560
our perspective on things and you know i don't know this guy i don't know this michael patcher

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.960
guy so i'm not trying to say this disrespectfully but what the fuck makes him so goddamn special

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:47.600
like you know i see his name everywhere and on these websites and stuff but he's just

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:55.920
some asshole spouting off predictions just like me i guess he has a degree or something

02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:05.960
he works for uh web rush morgan i believe whatever you know what the guy does anyone

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:10.280
like call him out for all the stuff that he's wrong on no no everyone forgets and every

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:14.520
everyone reports about what he says it's just like when they were reporting about voldemort

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:19.360
talking about you know this and that and stuff and everyone reports on it because that's

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.480
what they do they're always saying something let's let's talk about it you know he he's

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.600
saying this he must have some insider information no he doesn't he's a guy guessing on stuff

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:31.220
i said he gets paid a lot more than he has a different background and again i'm not trying

02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:35.480
to sound disrespectful like i mean i realize this comes off completely rude but i mean

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:44.120
my the reality is i care no more or no less about his opinion than i do rob of us opinion

02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:49.080
they're equal to me they're both gamers you know what i mean and actually i like rob about

02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:52.880
just a slightly more he actually listens to this show michael hatcher is not a gamer he

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:58.800
he doesn't know shit about games rob is great uh going to our chat room and chat dot orange

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.000
on twitter.com oh here comes ego boost you ready break man says we listen to you every

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.320
week because one week we expect dark soccer to announce her plans for world domination

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:13.800
and she needs followers right dude that was in like episode four besides that why would

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.360
i announce my plans for world domination her plan for world domination is give me a dollar

02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:25.120
or a taco no why would i announce it because when it's going to be uh mysterious and who

02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:29.320
knows i might have already taken over the world it's just that i don't want the response

02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:35.080
we are this we already are the official video game podcast of the galaxy we are we we talked

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.720
about this a long time ago is that we've declared that we are the official video game podcast

02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:44.240
of the galaxy and that's that dibs patent pending but actually i do have to say that

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:50.760
you know dominating the entire world think about all of the paperwork and all of the

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:56.560
stuff you'd have to manage i just like i'll let the world fuck itself up oh yeah we did

02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:04.960
give bobby pluto we did give that bobby can have all of the dwarf planets series pluto

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:11.600
and it's oddly shaped moons all right moving on one other email last email tonight from

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:17.620
spazzinator who your space bar is broken or something like you have words running together

02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:22.360
here you type like i was just typed on a psp i don't know but anyway i'm gonna do my best

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.600
to get through this email hey olr instead of the usual topics that i typically bring

02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:31.520
up via email and twitter topics i thought i'd give my impressions of a recent downloadable

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:37.000
game release magic the gathering duels of the planeswalkers 2012 aka magic 2012 i forgot

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.120
that came out this week but it's only 2011 all right so fine magic 2012 is coming out

02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:44.880
now these are the i i really like these kind of emails i want to hear reviews especially

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:49.280
on games i haven't played but i have a slight interest in i like the last magic game so

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:54.760
let's see for those out there that are unfamiliar with the magic games this is the second in

02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.120
the series which is the video game adaptation of magic the gathering card game those who

02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:02.800
have played the card game at one point or another will have practically no problem picking

02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.000
up this game while newbies might have a marginally more difficult time with it due to the learning

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.360
curve but even then it's not too bad all in all it's a faithful recreation of the game

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:14.840
those who have picked up the original game last year really should pick up this one as

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:19.560
well there are no noticeable bugs at least on the psn version and from what i can tell

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:23.660
the devs have taken user input to heart and implemented much needed improvements while

02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:27.740
it's not perfect it's a drastic improvement over the first assuming that you haven't picked

02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:33.420
up the original game yet you want to pick up a cheap game i suggest passing passing

02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:38.440
up i'm sorry i suggest passing over the original game and just going for magic 2012 frankly

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:42.560
i find this to be pretty damn fun in a major time scene rivaling the elder scrolls and

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:46.400
fallout series in terms of amount of time that will inevitably be spent in this game

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.780
while the single player stuff is fun and will be played a lot initially for the purposes

02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:53.700
of unlocking stuff the real meat and potatoes of the game is the multiplayer which frankly

02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:58.060
is a blast additionally if you're a trophy or achievement whore the 20 achievements or

02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:02.180
trophies in the game are easy as hell to get even by my standards even my grandmother can

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:08.280
get them easily and she's been dead for 14 years wow that was morbid all in all i can't

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:12.760
recommend this game enough it is available for both xbox live arcade for 800 microsoft

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:18.680
points and on psn at its regular price for non ps plus members for 999 however due to

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:22.840
most people having a minimum of one month's worth of ps plus you can get the game at a

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:28.600
discount 799 so i give the psn version an ever so slight edge if only for that reason

02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:32.920
dude and you're totally a sony fanboy don't even try tonight no but it's pricing is a

02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.600
good point uh thanks for reading this email and sorry to dark sakura for sending this

02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.760
wall of text i just wanted to be thorough with my review you should be so thankful she's

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.360
not reading emails this week because the whole space thing she would have screamed use your

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:54.080
space space space i'm the best of space space we were doing that on space mountain he was

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:59.160
he liked magic so much that the space bar got stuck we were doing that on space mountain

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:06.160
remember i do i remember that i'm the best of space so much space gotta see it all and

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.220
then we did it on star tours yes which by the way is an awesome ride is it a lot better

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:17.840
now that they've fixed it uh you know the old one was charming but it is definitely

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.320
modern now it's a lot smoother and it's just what i love about the ride is it just starts

02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:27.280
right off with a bang like you know and you are on your way to whatever planet you go

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:34.420
to for the record we looked at how many different scenes and um at least with me and dan we've

02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:38.960
got all the beginnings there were two different beginnings right we've got all but one of

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.960
the second one we didn't get hoth and i've been to hoth so it's cool it's the it's the

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:48.560
best one we got all three of the middle scenes the the third ones which is either yoda akbar

02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:54.000
or leia it's a trap i know we're going to strip and then we got all but the last um

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.080
all but coruscant course for the last one naboos i i would say the riding the ride several

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.920
i've gotten i've seen all the last planets and i've seen all the i've seen every planet

02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:08.740
now and i will tell you the best ones are hoth for the first and uh nabu believe it

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:12.080
or not the jar jar binks planet is the best because it has the best ending oh it was great

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.400
well i did like the the um the death star one the death star one was pretty rad that's

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.120
a close second of course con's not of of what we got though my favorite was kasheek because

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:26.680
i like wookies anyhow we'll stop nerding about star tours now and get to the fus of the week

02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.040
it's the part of the show where we rant why because we can

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:51.920
f you to being sick it's it's not like it's a contagious disease it's all my sinuses and

02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:58.000
it happens around this time of year i wanted to go swimming today as a result i laid down

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.760
for what i intended to be an hour nap at 10 30 i woke up at 3 30 having slept through

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:10.560
my alarm seven times apparently i kept resetting it in my sleep so yeah uh if you did the fact

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:15.480
that i felt kind of like sickly lately like my my side was hurting and the doctor couldn't

02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:18.080
figure out what it is but at least it wasn't the same thing that put me in the hospital

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:24.080
in 08 so whatever and i had this weird head thing like i bruised my head or something

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:28.440
it fucking hurt like all week so if you did that and uh if you did the fact that my landlord

02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:33.760
says we owe them seven dollars like what where did that come from apparently it was something

02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:40.200
they just decided to throw on there a retro charge for something from april yeah what

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:47.920
f you lucky uh f you to uh fighting with my console and try to get it to work on my computer

02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:52.960
right now took me a while because it was set the 1080i it really needed to be 480p and

02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:58.360
i even did the thing to reset the uh graphics you know the quick little hold y and the right

02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:07.120
trigger and restart your console but uh it just didn't want to work i got the work now

02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:12.140

02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:47.800
for you guys and then the skype line 1877 game olr we'll get to that in just a moment

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:53.160
uh moving on though first couple more stories loki and of course you know one story that's

02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:58.320
been around ever since duke nukem forever was being announced that's coming out and

02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:04.440
so on and so forth there was a guy with a really old gamestop pre-order for duke nukem

02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:13.280
forever from back in 2001 and apparently the guy actually did get to redeem his pre-order

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:20.480
for duke nukem forever and um along with that uh gearbox even sent him a bunch of cool swag

02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.280
and uh stuff like that so uh apparently he does like the game the guy that picked up

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:35.120
the game so good for him glad that they you know took your receipt that you kept all this

02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:40.780
time all right one more new story for you guys and then we're going to open up that

02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:47.320
skype line 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and unfortunately

02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:52.280
and on a bit of a sad note tonight it's another game studio who apparently has closed their

02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:58.900
doors uh game republic is the studio apparently the website has disappeared it's no longer

02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:06.600
online the tokyo offices now vacated uh apparently the founder yoshiki okamoto huge amounts

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.760
of debt and can't be tracked down so unfortunately it looks like they've closed some of the game

02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:16.120
that they made majin and the forsaken kingdom uh folklore was another game that they made

02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:21.440
and i believe they were the studio behind uh genji day of the blade if i'm not mistaking

02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:27.940
uh the studio that's right of course infamous for the giant enemy crabs and while a lot

02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:31.140
of people are pointing and laughing at that whole thing it's never any fun to report developers

02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:36.920
losing their jobs it's a shitty economy right now no matter where you live all right let's

02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:42.040
open up the skype line it's open now 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:47.640
radio uh while we wait for those calls to come in i'm gonna ask loki if he has any last

02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:54.720
minute stories um not really i mean there's not a whole lot else that we have the report

02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:58.960
on i was gonna talk really quick though about uh there are some indie games that they're

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:07.080
showing off um and one of them uh was was it revolver 360 it's this game that's on the

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:12.960
xbox indie games and um it's pretty awesome i mean it just kind of goes to show you that

02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:17.440
there's like hidden gems out there it's basically a kind of almost like a cave style shooter

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:22.480
it's just uh bullet hell like crazy but what makes it unique is that you can rotate around

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:29.980
in kind of this 3d um this like 3d sphere so you can rotate the environment around so

02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:34.560
like if for example you have a you know bullets coming at you in a big line you can actually

02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:40.160
rotate it so that they're um you know vertical to the screen so you can dodge past everything

02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:46.120
uh kind of think of it like looking at tempest but kind of you know on the side let me go

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:49.800
to the phones we got a call coming in here hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:54.120
what up guys zenacore from the okc how y'all doing hey zenacore how you doing buddy you

02:19:54.120 --> 02:20:00.920
know just hanging out ducking the man you know good time so are we uh so uh what's what's

02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:07.240
on your mind i'm still pissed off about my yard's revenge purchase oh gosh i heard this

02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:14.340
game was not so great but what what what happened to you well it the idea behind the game was

02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:19.520
solid i mean it's just a cord yeah a old school corridor shooter like you know like lucky

02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:23.200
and wild or anything else like that from the arcade at least that's the way it felt to

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:29.320
me when i was playing it but just certain rudimentary things that were going on slipped

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:33.040
through the cracks just like if it really got rushed i think is what happened to it

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:38.960
i hate that i hate that when games are so obviously rushed i mean the game is functional

02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:43.080
but it looks like i mean the coders didn't finish putting the polish on everything when

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:46.800
you first started at least on the pc version what i'm playing it's not full screen you

02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:52.440
can see the windows border yeah so i mean most savvy user you hit alt enter it will

02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:56.680
go into windows mode but because of the age of my machine i can't put it in the direct

02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:02.680
x10 so i'm not sure if i'm looking at the right graphics uh and the game play is a bit

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:06.840
rough it's just not polished i think it really got rushed which kind of disappoints me because

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:10.200
i sort of like the new idea they're going with it how do you feel about all these like

02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:15.440
kind of uh reimagining i guess of classic games this is something atari has really done

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.520
a lot of and is going to continue to do over the next year i mean i think they've got a

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:24.460
centipede game coming out on 3ds uh warlords they've revisited i mean they're really trying

02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:30.080
to bank on nostalgia redone i guess what do you think about that i bought into that initially

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.520
when they're doing that with the uh the xbox live arcade i got a lot of those games but

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:38.980
you know sadly all the multiplayer stuff hardly anybody plays them even when they first came

02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:43.560
out plays a multiplayer which kind of disappointed me i was really looking forward to do like

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:48.800
tron deadly disc multiplayer and it's not happening so that was kind of upsetting but

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:53.680
as long as they add enough to the game to where if they're charging 10 bucks it feels

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:58.080
justified to me then it's fine they got to really polish it up or like what they did

02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:03.160
with yards events they changed the whole dynamic and used it as a as inspiration for their

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:07.260
game i'm cool with that but just make sure you finish it you know give me finished stuff

02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:10.880
that's all i want yeah it's kind of tough when you you know yards revenge was really

02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:15.480
easily one of the top three atari 2600 games they ever released and just to kind of like

02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:23.280
take a classic and just rush it oh that hurts it's not even that the game was badly designed

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.680
it's like the interface it's like normally when you're doing typesetting or whatever

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:31.520
you leave the text online or up on the screen long enough to where you can read it twice

02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:35.640
it's bare if you're a speed reader you might just catch everything and be able to understand

02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:41.920
what you're at it's it's that quick on screen even during during the game there's no speech

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:45.640
everything is in a chat bubble over on the corner you're not looking there in a hall

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:49.240
so you have no idea what the characters are saying to each other i'm barely i barely understood

02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:53.880
what was going on but that's thanks for me reading lots of uh fan subbed anime and stuff

02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:59.080
i'm used to looking at subtitles so i managed to catch everything uh what are the games

02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:03.560
you've been playing lately anything else you want to throw out there uh not really doing

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:09.240
a lot of really anime watching and uh you know the overseas stuff the x-men stuff and

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:13.720
uh the the green lantern release that just came out recently the animated version oh

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:16.560
mainly keeping up with that speaking of green lantern did you hear the news today the new

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:21.680
movie uh it made 53 million which to me sounds like a lot of money but apparently considering

02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:27.120
the budget and uh the marketing apparently they are calling that the very very low end

02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:33.640
of expectations that uh doesn't bode well for a sequel later on yeah i think they're

02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:38.640
initially predicting they'd get around 70 75 so i'm thinking that number is right around

02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:43.460
where thor was well it did it i funny enough the story i'd read referenced the thor opening

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:48.820
and it did open below thor and when you consider that i i guess they said i which i found weird

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:52.800
the green lantern was more well known than thor and that was that was again the the source

02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:57.100
that i read whatever but you could say that the actor in thor was an unknown whereas ryan

02:23:57.100 --> 02:24:01.040
reynolds people know him so that was kind of an ouch yeah i think it's because everybody

02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:06.440
knew he'd be better as a rile rainer or excuse me i get my lantern scared is screwed up here

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:10.520
but uh he's playing the wrong lantern in other words that we knew it so that's the problem

02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:15.000
more more proof that deadpool should have come out already because you know he'd be

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.040
perfect for deadpool oh yeah we knew that yeah so that's given all right well we geeks

02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:23.520
know all right i'm gonna let you go see of course we can take more calls but thanks for

02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:28.080
the uh review on yours revenge uh no problem man take it easy take care one eight seven

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.400
seven game olr a username on skype is orange on radio i like this tonight it's like we're

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.040
getting reviews from everybody on games i haven't been able to touch this is pretty

02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:40.920
nice so uh let's see if we get another one one eight seven seven game olr or a username

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:44.800
on skype is orange lounge radio let me ask you this dark sakura um while we're waiting

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:48.520
for some calls and loki left the room for a minute you know we're talking about nostalgia

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:54.120
on that last call in a game like yards revenge they've reimagined how do you you you really

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.400
still kind of live in the nostalgia world a little bit like you really probably play

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:02.720
more retro games than you do current games i mean that's that's not hidden by your gaming

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:11.600
weeks and so forth how do you feel about a lot of these reimaginings i really um it's

02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:16.040
kind of weird for me because if they're done faithfully then i have no problem with it

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:22.520
if they take the basic concept and evolve it i'm really excited by that but if it's

02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:31.120
just you know and my concept of butchering a game is pretty personal it's going to be

02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:36.160
different for everybody but if they just take it and completely ruin aspects of it that

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.720
i thought were great then then no like if they took the guardian legend and filled it

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:45.620
full of blood no no all right let's go to the phones because we got more calls coming

02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:51.600
in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh this is takey q takey q what's on

02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:57.560
your mind buddy um this is more of like a loki question okay any tips on upgrading a

02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:03.560
ps3 slims hard drive oh did you hear that any tips on upgrading a ps3 slims hard drive

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:09.120
just make sure you back up everything uh to something else first and then um it's pretty

02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:14.480
easy i mean you just pop it in there and then format it um you do have to make sure it's

02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:22.760
formatted fat32 i think though uh are there any online resources just search online there's

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:29.960
like uh there's a a thing from hp that you can format anything fat32 like i did my external

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:34.640
laptop you don't need that all you have to do is run it through dos yeah uh what do you

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:39.560
expand in the hard drive in your ps3 for you trying to fit more porn no just like i feel

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.760
like i'm running out of space on my 120 that came with it you know i have an 80 gig and

02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:48.520
i feel like i'm starting to run out of space too and a lot of it is because now thanks

02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:54.840
to the free games i'm installing these like five six gigabyte games on the drive and yeah

02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:58.720
i'm kind of i'm kind of with you i'm ready to expand my drive too do you download a lot

02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.840
of movies on playstation marketplace or is it all like game um well i'm mostly using

02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:08.240
voodoo now for the streaming since i don't like downloading from the psn store because

02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:12.600
it takes a while why do you uh like voodoo as compared to hulu and netflix i don't usually

02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:18.080
hear that one but i'm curious it's more for like the new releases it's like walmart for

02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:23.880
new releases so sometimes they have like a sale for like 99 cents for like a more recent

02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:29.240
movie i can watch that netflix doesn't have right all right very cool and like the new

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:33.920
releases you can just stream it instead of downloading it you know download takes like

02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:39.560
maybe two hours three hours or streaming you just it's there will i be able to watch this

02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:45.120
game of thrones that everybody's talking about on there i got a torn that that that that

02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:49.120
shows on sunday nights and so of course i've never seen it you know it's funny having done

02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:53.280
this show for nine years like any tv show that's on sunday nights i just i don't ever

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:57.140
get to watch like it's pretty good though i can't be good yeah i hear that one's really

02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:00.440
good and i can't tell you how many people over the years have said rob you would love

02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:04.820
desperate housewives because i like that campy type of stuff and i guess that shows very

02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:09.200
campy but never seen an episode sunday nights i'm like if it's on sunday nights i've never

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:15.880
watched it and i have another thing another question too sure um do you have to like download

02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:20.000
the firmware update for the when you're upgrading the hard drive like i've read like articles

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.280
on it that you have to uh loki left the room for a minute so i'm not sure because i haven't

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:31.480
changed my loki firmware update do you have to do a firmware update when you change those

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:41.760
drives um i think you may have to redo the one your current firmware update to uh change

02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:46.800
them over it says that you have to do it again and it's supposed to not work afterwards but

02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:52.880
i put it i went from my 20 to my 500 maybe i didn't go back to my 20 i thought about

02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:56.560
going back to my 20 but i never did can you use a usb drive with those this might be a

02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:02.120
dumb question but you can but you can't store games to it oh interesting do you do movies

02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:08.720
you put movies on there you can put like pictures music nice but you have to have certain directories

02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:13.080
and stuff all right all right well uh any other thoughts for tonight before i let you

02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:21.440
go um bye-bye socom why you say bye-bye socom didn't like the game i rented it and didn't

02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:26.620
like the controls that you can't change it oh i hate that customizability should be like

02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:32.280
one of the first easy things to think about out here so i'm i'm very uh i guess call of

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:37.180
duty player where you get you gotta have the triggers to fire and sight iron sight see

02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:44.040

02:29:57.660 --> 02:30:04.980
we get any other calls we're out of last minute stories right so we'll just uh we'll see if

02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:09.000
anybody calls oh there it is lighting up there's always that little delay between uh when we

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.400
say something when it goes out over the air hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:17.000
it's the one and only ronma of course i knew you i knew you'd get through eventually ever

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:20.720
since you said in chat that i missed your twitter topic sorry about that it's okay i

02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:24.800
forgive you i wasn't reading chronologically this week because we got a few that i wanted

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:31.420
to make sure i mentioned before today so that's why i screwed up but anyway fair enough what's

02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:39.880
on your mind duke nukem forever ah what about it it's a guilty pleasure game to me the game

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:45.120
is so bad it's just good so it's like the showgirls of video games something along those

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:52.560
lines yes what uh tell us about how this game is so bad it's good like give give an example

02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:55.480
of something in the game that happens where you're like oh my god this is terrible and

02:30:55.480 --> 02:31:03.040
i love it for example um if you remember from the demo there are two twins in the game they're

02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:13.760
called the wholesome twins mary and kate so no secret what that's parodying huh yeah pretty

02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:19.360
much and they show a video clip of them doing a video to a song called full house oh it's

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:25.680
terrible very terrible i heard something about they die horribly later on like spoilers omg

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:30.120
but i i don't know i'm at the point where the aliens kidnap them and dukes all pissed

02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:35.220
the fuck off about it i i hear it's not a pretty ending like it actually has some people

02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:40.280
kind of saying that that's where that is exactly where the game crosses the line just so you

02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:46.560
know i won't ruin it for you but you don't kill the hot chicks you don't do that i hear

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:52.660
the ending is like wow but we'll see uh so what do you think about these websites that

02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:58.840
are giving the game a zero i think the sites are giving the game a zero are coming from

02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:05.940
people who did not grow up playing the original duke nukem 3d it sounds like these are people

02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:11.200
that are younger than me who don't know that ass from a hole in the wall also they're counting

02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:16.960
on the fact that gearbox is working on so they expected something big like borderlands

02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:21.540
as i said before all gearbox said that they were going to do was put the game out they

02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:27.900
never said what they're going to exactly and so the weight of 12 plus years is like okay

02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:32.480
let's see what you got it seems like they were just looking for a reason to just blast

02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:36.020
a game here comes dan the man wants to say something on this topic yeah it should be

02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:41.580
on just make sure oh god geez it makes everybody wonder why they weren't putting it out oh

02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:46.080
because it sucked nuts and they knew it they were like holy fucking god we can't fix it

02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:55.680
it's terrible and there you go that's what you all fucking get oh my god fucking even

02:32:55.680 --> 02:33:01.660
gearbox couldn't polish that turd and gearbox rules great duke nukem's over fucking finish

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:05.500
the next brothers in arms or whatever the fuck you're doing and get to work on borderlands

02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:11.500
too but rama says rama's review of the game is that this game is so bad it's good i hope

02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:17.400
to find out when i'm done with the game i will ship it overnight to you so you can play

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:22.860
you don't have to i'm getting a copy well there you go uh sg100 matt in the chat room

02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:26.660

we'll see we'll see we already got our mortal combat reactions i could see that really i
