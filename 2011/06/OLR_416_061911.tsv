0	18320	Tonight, June 19th, 2011, more details emerge on the Wii U.
18320	22800	A Facebook game developer sues an alleged copycat, and a Kinect software development
22800	31560	kit for Windows is released.
31560	34800	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34800	39040	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39040	42360	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the
42360	45080	one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
45080	46080	Hi.
46080	47080	How are you?
47080	48080	I'm unwell.
48080	49080	I'm sorry to hear that.
49080	50080	What's wrong?
50080	51080	Sinuses.
51080	52080	Aww.
52080	53080	I'm unwell.
53080	54080	I'm unwell.
54080	59200	Everybody say hello to Dark Sakura, also known as Manuel.
59200	62000	And the smartass over there in the corner, the one and only tech master, Loki.
62000	63000	Hello.
63000	64000	How are you doing, Loki?
64000	65200	I'm doing fine.
65200	71080	I'm eating the large, unhealthy sandwich, as is tradition.
71080	73120	What is this unhealthy sandwich that you're eating?
73120	78760	It's a grinder from our very, very discounted food chain, Winco.
78760	82840	But it's basically an Italian sandwich on a loaf of garlic bread.
82840	83840	It's so good.
83840	84840	And it's called a grinder?
84840	86840	It's called a grinder.
86840	88840	On the iPhone, a grinder, never mind.
88840	94240	Anyhow, if you want to join us, the ever-present fourth guest on our show is the chat room.
94240	98800	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us in our chat room and say hello, because
98800	104000	we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
104000	109880	www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Loki is holding his sandwich
109880	116240	up in the air like it's a victory pose, like he's He-Man or something, or the little Zelda
116240	117240	noise.
117240	118240	Anyhow.
118240	119240	All right.
119240	122480	So, Loki, you didn't get to join us for the second E3 show, obviously.
122480	126560	That was the last thing that was on the feed, and we were off on Sunday, because we had
126560	129320	done the other E3 shows Tuesday and Wednesday.
129320	133800	You were here Wednesday when we talked about things like Skyrim, and I believe that was
133800	137680	the day that Miklotov had waited in line to play the Vita, and so forth.
137680	141640	Any kind of closing thoughts from you for E3, since you didn't get your chance before
141640	142640	Loki?
142640	143640	Um.
143640	145640	Not for John Spodley.
145640	149240	The play-throw's awesome, I mean.
149240	157080	No, I don't know, like, the PlayStation Vita, I don't really care for.
157080	163280	I mean, there's a lot of features to it, which is kind of cool, but I just don't know if
163280	164760	I really care about it too much.
164760	168400	I mean, there's not any games that jump out and say, oh my god, I gotta own that.
168400	172880	Like, you know what, Uncharted, see, I'm not a fan of the Uncharted series.
172880	178440	Not that it's a bad series, but I just never played them, and don't really want to play
178440	179440	them.
179440	180440	There's not enough time to play everything.
180440	181440	Exactly.
181440	182440	This isn't our day job, so.
182440	183440	It's all right.
183440	185600	I mean, it looks good.
185600	189320	I was unaware, now I don't remember the whole entire feature list, but I guess those things
189320	191240	have GPS built into them.
191240	194680	Yeah, I seem to remember that from the original unveiling, yeah.
194680	198720	I just saw that because I'm setting up the items for it, and they've got, like, some
198720	200040	games.
200040	203400	It breaks it down, you know how in the back of those PlayStation boxes, like, okay, you
203400	208840	need such and such space for storage, it's one player, it's online, it's blah blah blah.
208840	213120	Well, they actually break it down to what features of the Vita are actually used.
213120	218060	Like, this uses the front touch, this uses the back touch, the tilt controls, the multi-touch
218060	220800	on things, sliding your finger back, I mean.
220800	226160	So on a one to ten on the gimmick meter, this game rates a six or a seven.
226160	227160	Yeah, I'm sure.
227160	228840	Especially those launch games will make heavy use of gimmicks.
228840	232920	I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of gimmicky stuff on there, but I think it's got potential
232920	238500	as far as, you know, it's nice that that stuff is on there, just please, publishers, don't
238500	241400	try to, you know, just make a bunch of gimmicks.
241400	242960	Use it if it makes sense.
242960	243960	Exactly.
243960	249760	I mean, don't necessarily have to use the touch screen for stuff you don't, you know,
249760	250760	need to use it for.
250760	253120	I mean, buttons work just as well, I don't know.
253120	257320	Let me go to this comment from chatroom at chat.orangelaungeready.com where, by the way,
257320	260480	there's a lot of praise going on for your sandwich that sounds really good.
260480	261480	It is really good.
261480	262960	You get a picture of that.
262960	263960	That just looks like...
263960	264960	That's a half.
264960	265960	That's half of the sandwich.
265960	267400	That is a heart attack that you're eating.
267400	268400	That's half a sandwich.
268400	269400	Alright, anyhow.
269400	274160	So, going to chatroom, BlackWolf starts us off tonight, and this is a quote I've heard
274160	277180	him say several times, in fact on his own show, and I don't remember if he said it
277180	281760	on our E3 or whatever, but BlackWolf starts us off tonight saying, Saints Row is the video
281760	285280	game version of what goes on in Loki's head.
285280	286280	Exactly.
286280	288320	Pretty much.
288320	294840	Saints Row is basically, cause, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV really was kind of a step
294840	298680	away from the direction of Grand Theft Auto was kind of going.
298680	301080	San Andreas was just a really crazy game.
301080	302680	I mean, you could do so much in there.
302680	303680	You could do pretty much anything.
303680	307360	I mean, you had girlfriends you could do, you could go ride a bicycle, you can do base
307360	313160	jumping, you know, swim in the ocean, fly jets, you know, just wander around the desert,
313160	315080	go gamble, whatever.
315080	319960	And then, Rockstar's like, hey, you know what, we're going to make the game more realistic.
319960	324640	So we're taking out all the fun stuff, like the tanks, the flamethrowers, the miniguns.
324640	325640	We're taking that all out.
325640	331840	We're just going to make this game more realistic, and everyone was kind of like, eh, okay.
331840	336080	And then, like, as stuff, their expansions came out, you know, they started kind of bringing
336080	341480	that over the top stuff back, but it's still nothing to what San Andreas was, whereas Saints
341480	345840	Row was kind of crazy at the beginning, and then the second game was even crazier.
345840	350640	The third game is just, they basically, the developer was even, you know, quoted saying
350640	357400	before, you know, Saints Row, the, you know, activities and stuff were kind of over the
357400	358400	top.
358400	361000	Saints Row the third were making everything over the top.
361000	365320	Every single situation that you're in, every single battle that you're, you know, fighting,
365320	368600	you know, the story, everything is going to be ridiculous, just over the top.
368600	373440	You're going to be telling yourself, I can't believe I'm doing this right now.
373440	377760	And just even watching the gameplay videos, and I've linked a ton of them on Twitter,
377760	381000	it's just, it's awesome.
381000	384640	The only disappointment for me is the lack of multiplayer.
384640	390560	I mean, there's two player co-op in the single player campaign, but I really wish there was
390560	391560	like a death match or something.
391560	392760	Are you worried at all about this?
392760	394640	Because this notoriously happens at E3.
394640	398560	You know, we've been doing a show for nine years now, and I think out of those nine years
398560	400880	we've gone to like five or six E3s.
400880	406120	So out of those E3s, we tend to come out of there really liking one game, and then sometimes
406120	408280	that game will come out and it sucks.
408280	412840	My case in point, Nintendogs, I was so excited for Nintendogs, when it came out and it was
412840	413840	over in 15 minutes.
413840	415320	Are you worried that's what's going to happen?
415320	419400	No, I am absolutely confident that it's going to be an awesome game, because the other games
419400	420960	have been great.
420960	421960	And that's the thing.
421960	426200	It's like, you know, Saints Row, when it first came out, I'm like, well, there's no Grand
426200	429880	Theft Auto in the 360, so this will just have to kind of do, and you know what?
429880	431680	It wasn't a Grand Theft Auto clone.
431680	434680	I mean, it kind of started off as that, I guess, a little bit.
434680	438520	I mean, there was a lot of stuff it imitated, but it was its own thing.
438520	444360	And as the future games came out, it really came onto its own, and it's a really fun game.
444360	447400	Even if you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto, you really should go play Saints Row, because
447400	449680	it's a really fun game.
449680	450680	Let me ask this.
450680	453640	Of course, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that good stuff, but I'm just dying
453640	456440	to ask this question to Loki, since we're on the topic of Saints Row the Third.
456440	460040	Obviously, one of the big games that came out this week was Duke Nukem Forever.
460040	464120	And although I think it's on our showroll to cover later in the show, it's no big surprise.
464120	468200	I think a lot of you know, Duke Nukem Forever has been really razzed in the gaming press
468200	469640	as a whole.
469640	475600	And a lot of it has been about, you know, just how, it's almost like the sense of humor
475600	479400	in the game is to that point where it's like the guy that's so drunk, he's getting really
479400	481120	awkward with his humor.
481120	483960	And a lot of people are really saying like, the humor kind of steps over a line in this
483960	484960	game.
484960	489160	But yet, some of those same people are really excited the way you are about Saints Row the
489160	490160	Third.
490160	495080	Do you think there's a discrepancy, a bit of hypocrisy going on right now in the mainstream
495080	496080	gaming press?
496080	499640	There's not hypocrisy, it's just the way they're describing the game is a little inaccurate.
499640	502400	Here's the problem with Duke Nukem Forever.
502400	507720	My main two problems with it right now, and I'm not that far into the game, are one, the
507720	508720	game looks very muddy.
508720	510280	Like, the graphics are very brown.
510280	514120	Yeah, I know a lot of shooters out there tend to kind of go with the brown color palette,
514120	518640	but this looks like they had a decent looking game and then they just splat poo all over
518640	519640	it.
519640	523840	I mean, it's just very dark, and like, even when you're playing it in HD and stuff, it
523840	527880	looks like you're playing it on like a really low res, you know, screen or something.
527880	529840	It's just the colors just look very, eh.
529840	532400	Did Duke literally splash poo on them?
532400	537120	Because I saw in the demo you can do that now, and like, Alan was playing it and making
537120	540360	me watch and I was like, really?
540360	541360	Really?
541360	542360	You can fling poo?
542360	543360	But see, that's the problem though.
543360	546040	Duke Nukem 3D was a very colorful game.
546040	552280	I mean, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just over the top like bright and cheery and stuff,
552280	554920	but I mean, come on, there's a little bit of a middle ground there.
554920	559800	It's like they intentionally made it look like garbage, and I understand that they're
559800	565240	trying to poke fun at shooters being all brown, but you know what?
565240	567040	That's just not funny.
567040	570720	It's not funny, oh, haha, all those shooters are crap, so we're gonna make our game crap
570720	571720	too.
571720	572720	I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
572720	573720	Why would you do that?
573720	574820	And the load time is terrible.
574820	581540	The load time for the game is just ridiculously awful, and that just screams to me that they
581540	584880	just really rushed their way through this game, and I kind of think that they did it.
584880	587080	It's like they went through the motions of everything.
587080	594060	For example, like the first two levels or so that I played through it so far, you can
594060	596260	interact with everything, which is great.
596260	597260	You know what?
597260	601480	In Duke Nukem 3D, you can open doors, you can hit buttons, you can flip the light switch
601480	605920	on and off and stuff like that, but this is like, okay, I can turn all the showers on
605920	609000	and off, I can flush all the toilets, I can piss in all the toilets, I can pick poop out
609000	612240	of there and throw, I can draw on a chalkboard and stuff, but that doesn't make the game
612240	613240	good.
613240	617840	It's just like, you know, I'm walking through, oh, we gotta escape the building, the aliens
617840	621720	are attacking, and it's like, oh, or I can play pool, and I can play pinball, and I can
621720	623800	do this.
623800	624800	It's kind of pointless.
624800	628760	They spent all their time making all this stuff work when they really...
628760	633040	It sounds like the version of what we really want to do in Sony PlayStation Home.
633040	634040	It's like they took...
634040	635040	We would like to fling poo in Central Plaza.
635040	639480	It's like they took a really run-down car that's just completely broken, and they put
639480	643580	shiny rims on it, and they want to make sure those rims were extra polished, so they spent
643580	647720	all their time polishing those rims to make them the shiniest rims you've ever seen, but
647720	650000	the car is shit.
650000	654760	It won't drive, because it's just a shitty car, and they rush through there, oh crap,
654760	656760	I gotta make the car work as well.
656760	660560	That's really the problem, and like some of the spoilers I've heard, and you know, because
660560	663640	the first level of the game, of course, is him playing the video game, and he makes the
663640	666040	joke, oh, well, is it any good?
666040	668240	Well, for 13 years, it better be.
668240	672200	Well yeah, that's great that you poked fun at the fact that it took 13 years, but then
672200	676120	you spent, what, like a year and a half on this game, and it's terrible.
676120	679760	Okay, I gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangemantrady.com, because we are the show where every gamer
679760	680760	has a voice.
680760	681760	Here's some voices right now.
681760	684920	Brakeman, a game that has been delayed for 12 years was rushed?
684920	685920	What the fuck?
685920	686920	How did they pull that off?
686920	691520	You see, I think it's, and I think this is obvious, I'm probably staying the obvious
691520	694840	here, but I think it's a gross misinterpretation to say this game was in development for 12
694840	695840	years.
695840	696840	It wasn't.
696840	697840	The idea has been kicked around for 12 years.
697840	700280	It has really been in development for like a year and a half.
700280	701280	But that's terrible, though.
701280	704520	Maybe some art, some things on paper, but come on.
704520	709240	But, come on, I've seen games at this company, they put out Borderlands, I mean, Borderlands
709240	710480	was awesome.
710480	714040	Take that damn engine and put it into Duke Nukem, that's all you need to do.
714040	716240	Just redo the assets, and it's perfect.
716240	720700	Salacious Pop is asking, Loki, the 360 or the PS3 console version?
720700	724960	Because the PS3 version is allegedly a leaps and bounds better port, and the 360 one is
724960	725960	toilet.
725960	726960	It is the 360.
726960	727960	Hmm.
727960	728960	Okay.
728960	730520	But I don't think that the graphics are that different.
730520	732480	It's the color palette and load time.
732480	735520	Scott Pilgrim in our chat says, Gearbox said that they were going to make the game and
735520	737640	nothing about it being a spectacular game.
737640	739560	Okay, then why even bother?
739560	743000	Why even bother if you're gonna, oh, well, we're just gonna finish it, I mean, we're
743000	744200	gonna do a shitty job.
744200	746760	Why would you put your name on it, then, if that's what you're gonna do?
746760	751540	If you're gonna just sit there and poop out a game that, you know, was half done and you're
751540	756280	just gonna kind of patch it all together to make sure it works, why would you even bother
756280	757280	doing that?
757280	758280	Oh, well, we did it for the fans.
758280	760060	Yes, the fans really want a shitty game.
760060	762520	That's what they've been waiting 13 years for, is a really shitty game.
762520	766040	Let me go to this last comment from our chat room, and then we'll go to our gaming weeks.
766040	770560	Kaijuto in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, I wanna know who thought this game was
770560	771620	gonna be good.
771620	773680	They delayed it 12 years for a reason.
773680	777020	The game would have not seen the light of day if gamers weren't crying about it for
777020	778020	all these years.
778020	779020	No, exactly.
779020	785160	I didn't think it was gonna be good, but it's, those are my two complaints, muddy, long load
785160	786160	time.
786160	789680	Disclaimer, I haven't played the game yet, so I don't have an opinion on it one way or
789680	790680	the other.
790680	793560	I mean, I can read the reviews, but I also know not to always trust reviews, because
793560	794560	they're sometimes wrong.
794560	798600	In fact, about a game that I'm gonna get into later during my gaming week, I think a lot
798600	800460	of review sites got it wrong.
800460	806680	But anyhow, as far as Duke Nukem Forever goes, you know, I think a big part of the reason
806680	811920	it came out was because of its legend status that it had in the gaming community as this
811920	814760	is the game you will never get to play.
814760	820200	And obviously, there's a love of the original Duke Nukem 3D and maybe all the way back to
820200	823480	the old Apogee 2D Duke Nukem with that whole crude sense of humor.
823480	828280	I mean, obviously, it's inspired even if it maybe crosses the line, depending on who you
828280	829280	are.
829280	831680	Anyhow, let's talk about some other games.
831680	834800	As we get into how is your gaming week, what are the games that you've been playing this
834800	835800	week?
835800	836800	Dark Sakura.
836800	843000	Well, to go back to two weeks worth of gaming, I played Kix at Flynn's, and Space Paranoids,
843000	844000	and Tron.
844000	847920	Now, Space Paranoids is funny because Space Paranoids, which is an arcade game that I
847920	852240	believe you can only play at Electronica, I think that's where the only thing is, it's
852240	857280	sitting amongst all these 80s arcades games, and it's made to look like an 80s arcade game,
857280	858280	but it's not.
858280	862840	It was something that was made kind of newer, like it's running on a PC, clearly, but it's
862840	863840	in a cabinet.
863840	864840	Yeah.
864840	865840	It's kind of interesting.
865840	866840	Yeah.
866840	867840	That's what it was for.
867840	870800	But it makes sense that they'd put it in with Electronica, because, I mean, it was the
870800	874320	big game when the first Tron came out, you know, in the movie.
874320	877560	Well, and Disney's very about getting you in the experience.
877560	880960	You know, like, when you go on Space Mountain, you are boarding a spaceship and about to
880960	882360	go through the galaxy.
882360	883360	Space Mountain is not a rollercoaster.
883360	886720	If a Disney employee ever called it a rollercoaster, they'd be sacked.
886720	888160	It's a spaceship.
888160	889160	That's how it works.
889160	892640	So when you go to Flynn's arcade, I mean, it's very much a detail thing, and because
892640	897360	Space Paranoids was a game that Kevin Flynn, that's what he made all his money developing,
897360	898360	right?
898360	901080	Like, they had to make it to beat you in that experience.
901080	904720	Well, to me, technically, Dillinger stole it from him, made all the money, and then,
904720	905720	yeah, just watched it.
905720	906720	Blah, blah, blah.
906720	907720	All right.
907720	908720	Fine.
908720	909720	This is my favorite Disney movie.
909720	914240	Um, we, uh, crap, what else did I play?
914240	917080	Oh, Black Wolf says you can actually play it online as well.
917080	918720	Space Paranoids Online dot com.
918720	919720	Thank you.
919720	923600	Um, I played some WoW.
923600	924600	I played VVVVVVV.
924600	925600	Mm-hmm.
925600	926940	Game's frustrating as hell.
926940	929200	I hear it's a really well-received indie title, though.
929200	930200	I haven't played it myself.
930200	931200	It's fun.
931200	932200	Yeah?
932200	933200	It's fun.
933200	934200	What do you do in that game?
934200	937320	You don't necessarily have a jump as much as you have a reverse gravity, and so to get
937320	941160	over traps, you have to play with gravity, either walking on the bottom or you're walking
941160	942160	on the ceiling.
942160	943160	That sounds kind of neat.
943160	948760	It is, but it's frustrating and a little difficult, but it took a little bit to get used to.
948760	953720	And um, I played some Peggle, and played some, uh, Portal.
953720	955720	Good times.
955720	957440	Portal 2, of course, right?
957440	958440	Yeah, Portal 2.
958440	968080	And then, um, we got, uh, Initial D Extreme Stage for PS3, and Dan actually has been playing
968080	973320	a bunch of that, but I had to go in and translate a little bit for him, because I can read enough
973320	979080	in that to get an idea of what menu is what, but it's very Japanese-intensive.
979080	980080	It's pretty good, though.
980080	983800	It only has, like, two songs in it and one story mode, so, but it's got, like, I think
983800	987600	two extra tracks than what the arcade version has.
987600	991400	I think the arcade version is the fourth stage game.
991400	993920	All I can say is hooray for Reach and Free PlayStation, right?
993920	995920	So you can do that stuff.
995920	996920	Yeah.
996920	997920	Alright.
997920	1004560	Um, but it gave him an excuse to bring back out the, uh, the rig that he bought for Gran
1004560	1005560	Turismo.
1005560	1011760	And, uh, it actually works really good for, uh, the PS2 Initial D game.
1011760	1014560	Just thought I would point that out.
1014560	1015560	Alright.
1015560	1020840	Um, and then, uh, I guess that's really about it.
1020840	1027200	I know I played some other stuff, but my brain's not working, so I'm just gonna say stuff.
1027200	1029080	Alright, let's go- Oh!
1029080	1030080	World Cup Soccer Pinball.
1030080	1031080	Hell yeah.
1031080	1032080	Of course.
1032080	1033080	Of course.
1033080	1036720	Alright, let's go to, uh, Loki, and, uh, how was your gaming week?
1036720	1037720	Obviously you played some Duke Nukem.
1037720	1038720	A little bit.
1038720	1041720	Uh, yeah, a little bit of Duke Nukem.
1041720	1051040	Um, pretty much just, you know, a little bit of Duke Nukem, um, a little bit of, well,
1051040	1056960	lots of Grand Theft Auto, and, um, that's pretty much it, you know, I really didn't
1056960	1058960	play a whole lot.
1058960	1059960	Alright.
1059960	1061400	Not every week can be so exciting.
1061400	1065240	Um, I actually kind of had one of those weeks where I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.
1065240	1067920	The only new game I played is not new.
1067920	1072640	I played, uh, Little Big Planet on the PSP, because obviously this is one of the free
1072640	1077240	games that they're giving away as part of the whole Welcome Back program, so, you know,
1077240	1082000	that was one of the ones I chose to get, because I loved the original on PlayStation 3, so
1082000	1083320	I decided to get this one.
1083320	1088080	I'm not far enough into it yet where I can really review it, um, but, you know, one of
1088080	1091600	the big differences I noticed right away is that, well, obviously the graphics are scaled
1091600	1096340	down a little bit because it's on the PSP and not the PS3, but it's- they capture it
1096340	1097340	very faithfully.
1097340	1102800	Uh, there's only two planes, um, of three dimensions, not three, like you have in the
1102800	1103800	PlayStation 3 version.
1103800	1105440	There's just a front and a back in this one.
1105440	1108800	But otherwise, all the levels so far seem to be pretty faithfully recreated.
1108800	1112400	I haven't really got into the whole online stuff and the levels on there.
1112400	1117500	In fact, I can't even access that yet- now- yet, um, I was starting to wonder for a minute
1117500	1120680	if they're even there, but there's a planet for download levels, so I'll have to look
1120680	1123520	into that a little more later on and how all that works.
1123520	1127400	So, I can't really review the game, but I did play it for, eh, about an hour or so.
1127400	1131160	But the game I've been spending most of my time with, I actually revisited a game that
1131160	1135720	I started playing about 15 months ago, but I never finished.
1135720	1139640	And I think part of it was just, at that time, I was really heavy into WoW and I wasn't really
1139640	1140640	playing any other games.
1140640	1144520	Uh, and then I loaned my copy of it to Dark Sakura for like a year.
1144520	1148340	So I just got it back when we got back from the Disneyland trip this past Sunday.
1148340	1150680	And that's Final Fantasy XIII.
1150680	1154400	And I have- I started over on Final Fantasy XIII because I'm one of those people that
1154400	1159360	with an RPG, if I can't remember the story and where I was at, then screw it, I'm starting
1159360	1160360	over.
1160360	1165520	And so I started the entire game over and I have spent more time in the past week playing
1165520	1169200	it than I did in its original run when I first played it.
1169200	1171960	Uh, I'm already past the point where I was before.
1171960	1174880	So yeah, I've been having a lot of fun with that game.
1174880	1177400	And you know, that game got razzed by critics a lot when it first came out.
1177400	1178400	It was kind of mixed.
1178400	1179400	It just had a lot of mix.
1179400	1182200	And a lot of the people didn't like it because it's very linear.
1182200	1187880	And unfortunately, Final Fantasy XIII doesn't not get linear until like Chapter 10 or 11
1187880	1189280	in the story.
1189280	1192440	And I think that's one of the things that, you know, really bugged a lot of people is
1192440	1195640	that a lot of the level design is very one path.
1195640	1199300	Um, but one of the strengths of Final Fantasy XIII for me, of course, is the battle system.
1199300	1200680	I love the battle system in XIII.
1200680	1201680	It's one of my favorites.
1201680	1204680	Like the whole paradigm shifts into the different classes.
1204680	1208360	If you've never played, the battle system in XIII is like, you know, you can be a black
1208360	1213360	mage one minute and then you do like a paradigm shift and suddenly you're more of a buffing
1213360	1214760	or debuff mage.
1214760	1217960	Like I guess that would be like a, what are those, the green mages, I think, that did
1217960	1222480	a lot of that in V. And then, you know, you can switch again and you're more of like a
1222480	1223480	warrior.
1223480	1227000	It's pretty cool just flipping back and forth in the different battles.
1227000	1228000	I really like that.
1228000	1231760	And then a lot of people bitching about the characters in the game as well.
1231760	1238280	And I think, again, you know, if you stick with it, a lot of the characters don't end
1238280	1242620	up so one dimensional if you play the game for more than 10 hours of gameplay.
1242620	1245800	You know, some of the characters, like the kids are the ones that usually get a lot of
1245800	1247820	hate, uh, Hope and Vanille.
1247820	1254440	And those two characters get much more rounded out as you continue on with the game.
1254440	1256760	So, you know, I think it's worth it if you stick with it.
1256760	1261360	But at the same time, I also understand why if a game doesn't grab you right away, you're
1261360	1263440	not so inclined to want to stick with it.
1263440	1268680	I think visually, graphically, and sound-wise, there's enough to keep me entertained.
1268680	1274480	I think the graphics in this game are so freaking gorgeous, like, I can't even explain.
1274480	1278480	Like if you just, you just like to watch pretty things, there's plenty here to keep you entertained
1278480	1279480	for a while.
1279480	1282800	Uh, but I think part of the big motivator why I want to go back and play this game was
1282800	1288000	just hearing about Final Fantasy XIII-2 from E3 and it sounds like in this game they have
1288000	1291420	really addressed a lot of the things that people didn't like about the first game.
1291420	1296160	Like one of the things I noticed right off the bat were maps, even in the little trailer,
1296160	1297640	that were not linear.
1297640	1300760	Maps that showed big environments and open worlds.
1300760	1304840	So I have a feeling, uh, XIII-2 is really going to correct what a lot of people didn't
1304840	1306240	like about XIII.
1306240	1309720	But I want to be able to understand the story, so I wanted to actually just play through
1309720	1310720	XIII.
1310720	1312820	I mean, I could have just read spoilers, but I didn't really want to.
1312820	1314000	I wanted to play it.
1314000	1315360	So that's where I'm at.
1315360	1316360	Haven't beat it yet.
1316360	1318160	Hopefully by this time next week, we'll see.
1318160	1320320	I don't even know if I'm halfway through yet though.
1320320	1324000	I'm about chapter 9 or so.
1324000	1329240	So anyhow, that's it for my gaming week, at least all is notable.
1329240	1331160	Of course I play more WoW and things like that too.
1331160	1333680	But that's all I'll mention on tonight's show.
1333680	1337160	So let's move on to some housekeeping, then we'll get into the news tonight.
1337160	1340360	One big thing of course I wanted to say in the housekeeping tonight was happy Father's
1340360	1345120	Day to all the gamer dads out there, which would include Loki, it's your first, no it's,
1345120	1347200	yeah it's your first Father's Day, right?
1347200	1349720	So congratulations to you on that.
1349720	1351680	So what all chores did you get to do today?
1351680	1353040	What chores did you make your son do today?
1353040	1354040	How many diapers?
1354040	1359040	I just had to watch the baby all day and take my wife out to lunch.
1359040	1363120	No, so I said take my wife out to lunch.
1363120	1364120	Nice.
1364120	1367960	Looking at chat.orangelaunchy.com, some comments on Final Fantasy XIII.
1367960	1371640	Scott Pilgrim says, but Sky, the game gives you a brief recap though.
1371640	1377440	It does, and the data log is very impressive, but I don't know, I still just, I wanted to
1377440	1378540	start from scratch.
1378540	1379540	So I did.
1379540	1382040	I figured it wouldn't take me that long to catch up, and it didn't.
1382040	1385920	Anyhow, on the Father's Day topic too, of course, happy Father's Day to all the gamer
1385920	1390180	dads out there, or father figures, you know, if you have someone out there that considers
1390180	1393720	you their dad, then happy Father's Day to you.
1393720	1398000	Meanwhile, friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchyradio, we're on Twitter
1398000	1404080	as well, twitter.com slash olr, and visit our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
1404080	1406600	It'd be nice if we had more posts in the forums there.
1406600	1412000	Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news, and we'll start off with Loki.
1412000	1419280	Ah yes, news, and of course we're gonna start off talking about Wii U and some of the clarifications
1419280	1420280	on things.
1420280	1424460	Of course, everyone wants to know what's exactly in the console itself, because all the talk
1424460	1430440	was about the controller and what the controller can do, but you know, other than some videos
1430440	1435680	showing what possibly the system can do, we really didn't go into detail about the console
1435680	1436680	yet.
1436680	1440960	And it makes sense, because it's so far off that, you know, this stuff can change.
1440960	1448680	But right now, apparently the Wii U console will be using a custom Radeon GPU with a chip
1448680	1458920	similar to the R770, basically a chip that's found in some of the last generation ATI cards.
1458920	1467520	For example, like the 770 is in the 4870, which is, you know, it's a decent card.
1467520	1475520	It's better than some of the stuff that they have right now in the current gen consoles.
1475520	1480400	So it's good, but who knows, you know, by the time that these next gen consoles come
1480400	1483600	out, you know, what they're going to be packing.
1483600	1488400	But it will be able to hold up with at least the 360 and PS3 and may even be able to push
1488400	1493040	better graphics than that, so that's kind of cool.
1493040	1501180	Of course, also it came out that the Wii U will not have a DVD or Blu-ray playback, mainly
1501180	1506440	because it will actually be used in its own proprietary disk format.
1506440	1512080	And there also, you know, explains, well, Wii doesn't have DVD or Blu-ray playback capabilities
1512080	1517440	because, you know, the cost, and also they figured that enough people already have devices
1517440	1520860	that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray.
1520860	1525540	Good decision on Nintendo's part or bad?
1525540	1529800	It's probably true to a certain extent, and also I think it helps them as far as piracy
1529800	1533960	videos, because if it's their own disk format, you can't pop a, you know, if it's unable
1533960	1538200	to read DVDs, you can't burn a game onto a DVD.
1538200	1542320	Or you know, in the case, I mean, these games are going to be multiple gigabytes anyways,
1542320	1546480	but you can't burn a Blu-ray backup or something like that.
1546480	1548480	So it's going to use its own little format there to help...
1548480	1550520	You're going to have to rip it off a hard drive.
1550520	1551520	Alright.
1551520	1555040	I'm kind of, at first I was surprised.
1555040	1558740	I was like, wow, they're not going to support a movie format.
1558740	1559740	That's kind of shocking.
1559740	1562520	But then at the same time I was like, well, what Nintendo console really did support a
1562520	1563520	movie format?
1563520	1566440	I mean, GameCube didn't even play CDs.
1566440	1571400	You know, the Wii certainly doesn't play DVDs unless I guess you do some hacking with it,
1571400	1573580	which doesn't really count.
1573580	1576880	But it does Netflix, and I'm sure this new system's going to do the Netflix and the Hulu
1576880	1578080	and all that.
1578080	1583360	And I guess now we're in a different spot with our movies than we were 10 years ago.
1583360	1587280	I think there's a lot of people that rely on things like Netflix and Hulu and all the
1587280	1589400	other download things to get their movies.
1589400	1594200	And I think as long as Nintendo supports Netflix, which I'm sure it will, I think that's going
1594200	1595200	to be enough.
1595200	1596200	That's probably all it needs.
1596200	1597200	I mean, the Wii was the best-selling system.
1597200	1598400	It didn't even play DVDs.
1598400	1602160	I always thought it was a little weird to hear that Nintendo might go Blu-ray, because
1602160	1606600	Blu-ray's a Sony format, and I always thought that was a little weird, you know, whereas
1606600	1607600	I could see them...
1607600	1608600	But you can't really...
1608600	1613480	I mean, they have their own proprietary format right now, but I don't know.
1613480	1616960	You kind of either have to make your own or use theirs.
1616960	1621360	Scott Pilgrim in our chat room says, the Panasonic Q. But the Panasonic Q was Panasonic.
1621360	1622640	It was the other way around.
1622640	1624000	They licensed Nintendo's thing.
1624000	1626000	It wasn't the other way.
1626000	1628320	And besides, you couldn't even get that in America.
1628320	1629720	Who owned a Panasonic Q?
1629720	1632800	Not even Dark Sakura owned a Panasonic Q, so therefore no one owns one.
1632800	1633800	All right.
1633800	1635320	Maybe it's under the bed somewhere.
1635320	1638400	Maybe it's what you're going to get for Christmas this year.
1638400	1642640	Anyhow, moving on to more information about the current Wii and the DS.
1642640	1647000	You know, one of the things that was kind of surprising at E3 this year is that there
1647000	1651880	wasn't a lot of talk about what the heck is coming out on the Wii this year.
1651880	1654920	But there are some games still slated for the Wii this holiday season.
1654920	1661040	One of the big ones that barely got any coverage at E3, Kirby Wii, is coming out.
1661040	1664780	So yeah, Kirby is supposed to be in the fall, out at some point.
1664780	1669720	Some of the other games that are coming from Nintendo, they're putting out on the Wii.
1669720	1676320	Wii Play Motion on June 13th, Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave Incident, on June 27th,
1676320	1681200	Kirby Wii is in the fall, Fortune Street will be during the holiday, of course Zelda Skyward
1681200	1682200	Sword.
1682200	1687520	Also, Mario Party 9 and Rhythm Heaven on the Wii are announced for later this year.
1687520	1692160	Coming out from Nintendo on the DS later this year, not the 3DS, but the DS, Dragon Quest
1692160	1698240	Monsters, Joker 2, Kirby Mass Attack, Professor Layton and the Last Specter for the fall,
1698240	1701000	and Super Fossil Fighters over the holiday.
1701000	1703740	Some of the other releases on the Wii, let me just kind of throw it out there.
1703740	1710440	From Sega, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, that will be in November.
1710440	1716000	Ubisoft is putting out more game show ports, Family Feud 2012 and Price is Right Decades
1716000	1724240	in September, Just Dance 3 in the fall, WB Interactive has some movie tie-in games, also
1724240	1727640	the Sesame Street franchise going on there.
1727640	1734840	And then lastly, Konami has Dance Dance Revolution 2 in the fall, and what's sure to be a favorite
1734840	1741040	here at OLR, Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3 in the fall, woohoo.
1741040	1749120	Anyhow, how about the 3DS and moving forward, obviously the 3DS needs some bigger games
1749120	1753980	in order to make people really want to get it because the launch titles have not been
1753980	1754980	that great.
1754980	1760680	So, Zelda's out now, which of course was released today, so that was one of the big releases
1760680	1765120	and there's a lot of people probably going to jump on board finally for that game.
1765120	1770480	But if not Zelda, then maybe Star Fox 64 3D, which is dated for September 11th, yeah it's
1770480	1772200	Loki's birthday.
1772200	1777800	Kid Icarus will be during the holiday, as will Mario Kart and Super Mario, however you'll
1777800	1783640	have to wait until 2012 to play Lego City Stories and Luigi's Mansion 2.
1783640	1788560	Not dated yet, Animal Crossing and Paper Mario, so I would assume those games are all the
1788560	1791840	way out next summer, would be my guess.
1791840	1797380	Some of the other things that are coming out on the 3DS, Ubisoft is putting out all that
1797380	1804520	crap that they put out on the DS that sells millions, Pets Fantasy, Horses 3D, Imagine
1804520	1810540	Babies 3D, Raving Rabbids 5, maybe a little more in the direction of stuff we'd actually
1810540	1816560	play is coming out on the 3DS as well, Konami's putting out Frogger 3D in the fall, they've
1816560	1822000	dated Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater for the winter, Majesco's got Cooking Mama 4,
1822000	1827800	Kitchen Magic slated for October 11th, Capcom's got Resident Evil The Mercenaries dated June
1827800	1831720	28th, I didn't realize that was coming out so soon, Resident Evil Revelations is a little
1831720	1838080	further out, and then lastly from Activision, they've got Spiderman in the fall and a Transformers
1838080	1839800	game to support the movie in June.
1839800	1843400	So there is lots of stuff for the 3DS from the various third parties as well as Nintendo
1843400	1847120	themselves all the way through the rest of the year.
1847120	1849200	So Dark Sakura, going back to the Wii U.
1849200	1856560	Well, in other Wii U news, they are only doing one controller for it because of some cost
1856560	1857560	issue.
1857560	1866360	Basically, Iwata said that they don't want buyers to have to buy multiple Wii U controllers.
1866360	1871880	And by putting in different aspects of multiplayer that would involve the controller, they would
1871880	1876240	be pretty much insisting that people buy another Wii U controller and they were trying to cut
1876240	1878160	down costs for the consumer.
1878160	1881480	I kind of don't see where that matters.
1881480	1889680	I think just put in a strong single player and then, you know, later on add in.
1889680	1893480	Here's the problem in my opinion is that the Wii is a party system.
1893480	1897080	The Wii, especially when it first came out, was that system that got busted out at all
1897080	1898080	the parties.
1898080	1902000	Let's play Wii Tennis, let's play Mario Party, let's play, you know, Smash Brothers, whatever
1902000	1903000	the game was.
1903000	1905920	It was very much about a lot of those multiplayer experiences.
1905920	1911000	So it's very surprising that they've kind of said, well, multiplayer is not really going
1911000	1912120	to be like that on the Wii U.
1912120	1914980	I mean, granted, you will be able to use the Wiimote.
1914980	1917520	You will be able to use the classic controller.
1917520	1922240	So it's not like multiplayer experiences will be nonexistent.
1922240	1927920	But when this controller is such a huge factor of what they're trying to drive, it's interesting
1927920	1933280	that there's not going to be a thing where I could bring my Wii U controller over to
1933280	1937080	someone else's house and play on that controller.
1937080	1943780	But it's also not surprising because, remember, that controller is not a processor.
1943780	1948640	The image that you see on that Wii U controller is not being processed by the controller.
1948640	1954560	That's the biggest difference between the Wii U setup and what you've probably most
1954560	1958400	familiar with leading into this would be the GameCube going to the Game Boy Advance.
1958400	1960680	The Game Boy Advance has had processors in them.
1960680	1962740	They could process the data and so forth.
1962740	1965600	But the Wii U is all streaming from the box.
1965600	1969720	So it makes sense that it can't maybe stream to more than one, although I think I read
1969720	1974200	somewhere where it is actually capable of streaming to more than one, but it won't be
1974200	1975200	as good.
1975200	1976720	I don't know.
1976720	1979040	But it's going to be interesting.
1979040	1984640	I think there will be plenty of multiplayer experiences with the Classic Controller involved,
1984640	1988240	and certainly all the demos they were showing were just the one and the Wiimotes.
1988240	1994520	But yeah, it's a little disappointing to know that they're not going to try and do more.
1994520	1996920	But I guess it would be expensive to do that.
1996920	2000720	I mean, these controllers are probably going to be like a hundred bucks, and I know they've
2000720	2006000	said they're not going to sell them separately, but what if I lose mine or it's broken?
2006000	2010840	I think, I honestly don't think the controllers are going to be about a hundred bucks a pop.
2010840	2012300	I really don't think so.
2012300	2017800	I think you're maybe looking at, especially since it itself doesn't contain the processor,
2017800	2023440	I think you're really going to be looking at more around fifty bucks for the controller.
2023440	2028280	Game Guru in our chatroom says, I think this will kill the Wii U more than anything else.
2028280	2031520	Again, at the end of the day, it's really all about the games.
2031520	2037120	I have a really hard time being able to assess Wii U right now, because sure, I saw E3 like
2037120	2044340	you guys did, and I see the controller and so forth and the demos, but no real games
2044340	2045340	were shown.
2045340	2049400	I mean, maybe like a couple of very loose conceptual things like Ghost Recon and what
2049400	2053740	have you, but I'm sorry, there's not enough of what are the games really going to look
2053740	2055000	like on this thing.
2055000	2057600	And I don't think we're really going to know that answer until next E3.
2057600	2063560	So, I feel like I can't really judge this system until I see how does this really play
2063560	2068080	out or have they been able to think around these constraints really well.
2068080	2072080	And to Nintendo's credit, I think that's one thing they do really well is that they design
2072080	2076800	awesome games for the confines that they've built.
2076800	2077800	So we'll see.
2077800	2081060	Frisbee in our chatroom says, congratulations Nintendo, you defeated the entire purpose
2081060	2083080	to buy this console for its controller.
2083080	2087720	Can you imagine what families with multiple kids in it fighting over this controller?
2087720	2090760	Good point.
2090760	2093960	Gameguru in our chat says, really, they could have gutted a DS for this.
2093960	2098640	I find it fascinating that we can't use DS's and 3DS's, at least not yet.
2098640	2101840	Maybe that'll be something that comes out later as more controllers.
2101840	2104600	I'm really surprised that it ended up happening.
2104600	2105600	We'll see.
2105600	2110640	You know, I honestly think that that's going to be the big reveal before it's released
2110640	2116200	is that you get one of the Wii U controllers, but you can also use your other.
2116200	2118440	I think that's going to be the big thing.
2118440	2119440	We'll see.
2119440	2124480	But, I mean, look at some of the concepts that they've showed off.
2124480	2127480	New Super Mario Brothers Mii.
2127480	2129200	We added Miis this time.
2129200	2132900	I'm sorry, you don't need a new console to be that cheap.
2132900	2137640	But hold on, they said, to be fair, they said this is not a game we're announcing.
2137640	2141240	This is just a demo to show you what the system can do.
2141240	2142240	It can do Miis.
2142240	2143680	Oh my god.
2143680	2145360	So can the normal Wii.
2145360	2146640	Why even show that off?
2146640	2147640	It was just stupid.
2147640	2152640	I think the chase Mii and the shield stuff will ultimately get slapped into some mini
2152640	2155580	game collection that is what the system will come with.
2155580	2156580	Wii U parties.
2156580	2159520	Oh yeah, all the tech demos are going to be in the fucking, they're going to be sold at
2159520	2160520	some point.
2160520	2161520	Oh, we're not going to sell these games.
2161520	2162880	These aren't real games.
2162880	2167080	No, you're going to sell these games, because this is what you do, Nintendo.
2167080	2170080	You're like, hmm, how can we get away with the least amount of work?
2170080	2173720	Well, we made these tech demos and we're just sitting on them, let's put them together and
2173720	2177440	charge 50 bucks for them, we'll throw in the Wii remote.
2177440	2181280	They're going to the Weasley School of Test Design.
2181280	2182520	The Wheatley School.
2182520	2188600	I think that Nintendo, they still have a long time before this comes out, and I think they're
2188600	2191680	going to have a lot of time to respond to some of this criticism.
2191680	2196520	And I could definitely see Reggie coming out on stage at the next E3 saying, well, we heard
2196520	2201600	a lot about this that you guys didn't like, so we did this.
2201600	2203520	Was it contradictions?
2203520	2204640	We can do that.
2204640	2211160	We heard that you hate the fact that our analog joysticks, whatever, aren't really joysticks,
2211160	2212160	they're just circle pads.
2212160	2213680	So you know what we did?
2213680	2216520	We added more Miis into our games.
2216520	2219600	Hope you enjoy it.
2219600	2221760	We listened to the consumers.
2221760	2222760	You know what?
2222760	2225280	We heard that you don't like friend codes, so you know what we're going to do?
2225280	2226680	We're going to have buddy codes.
2226680	2230200	They're just like friend codes, but they're buddy codes.
2230200	2233360	Yeah, we know nothing about online.
2233360	2234360	That's the thing.
2234360	2238000	I can't sit here and tell you I'm going to buy a Wii U or I'm not going to buy a Wii
2238000	2239000	U.
2239000	2242360	And I don't think, honestly, any of you can sit here and tell me that you are or you aren't
2242360	2244520	buying one, because we don't really know.
2244520	2246400	We have an idea.
2246400	2247400	This is all we've got.
2247400	2252760	The idea, we see the direction Nintendo's going, but we don't see the path.
2252760	2256520	And I think they've got a year to really impress us.
2256520	2260880	Next E3, I'll tell you, if I think the Wii U is for me or not.
2260880	2261880	What, Loki?
2261880	2262880	You're laughing over there.
2262880	2265880	I'm just like thinking, you know, the direction that they're going to come out.
2265880	2269720	It's just going to be the same old shit with another gimmick attached to it.
2269720	2273120	It's what it really is going to end up, they're going to take you through this elaborate path
2273120	2278320	of promises and hopes and stuff and then we're just going to get right back to the Wii with
2278320	2283000	a gimmicky piece of shit that's now another controller for it.
2283000	2284500	People love gimmicky pieces of shit.
2284500	2286520	Why else is the Wii been the number one console?
2286520	2287520	Number one!
2287520	2291440	Because it's cheap.
2291440	2292720	Maybe this will end up being cheap too.
2292720	2293720	No it's not.
2293720	2294720	I don't know.
2294720	2296200	It won't be as cheap, but it will be cheap.
2296200	2297200	Alright.
2297200	2299400	Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.
2299400	2302840	I feel like we've talked Wii U to death between the E3 shows and so forth.
2302840	2304880	At least Nintendo's got people talking.
2304880	2306160	Everybody knows that name now.
2306160	2307760	They may hate it, but they know it.
2307760	2310200	Yeah, they know that name because that's all the fucking thing that they...
2310200	2311200	That's all they showed.
2311200	2317120	It was just, hey look, we got this game system that's not coming out for a year and a half.
2317120	2318120	I gotta read the...
2318120	2320480	There's actually a couple really good comments in chat I want to get here now that now we
2320480	2323160	get some stuff on the Wii U here.
2323160	2327680	Scott Pilgrim says, I'll buy a Wii U when Mario Kart comes out, if that.
2327680	2331720	Game Guru says, all of them will be put into Wii U Sports and be packaged with the console,
2331720	2335720	save New Super Mario Brothers Mii, which will come out separately and sell like 20 million
2335720	2336720	copies.
2336720	2341440	SSJ 100 Matt says, I felt Nintendo was forced into announcing the Wii U right now.
2341440	2344280	Developers were working on games for it and was starting to leak out.
2344280	2347960	They had to talk about it, this E3, because they wanted to put their spin on it.
2347960	2351160	If you think about it, they did the same thing with the Wii revolution.
2351160	2352160	Yeah.
2352160	2353160	Agree.
2353160	2355200	I feel like it was too early, but I understand.
2355200	2356200	They had to.
2356200	2357200	They had to.
2357200	2358200	No, they didn't.
2358200	2359200	Why'd they have to?
2359200	2360200	Because it would have been leaked out otherwise.
2360200	2361200	It was already leaked out.
2361200	2362200	So what?
2362200	2363200	We all knew it was a touch pad.
2363200	2364200	We all knew.
2364200	2365200	So what?
2365200	2366200	A big deal.
2366200	2367200	Yeah.
2367200	2368200	It just leaks out.
2368200	2369200	You don't have to go and confirm it.
2369200	2370200	You can just be motivated.
2370200	2371200	Investors.
2371200	2372200	It's still a wise corporate policy.
2372200	2373200	They want people to invest.
2373200	2375680	They want to convince the world that they're on to the next video.
2375680	2377080	They want their stocks to go up.
2377080	2378320	Well, that didn't work.
2378320	2382640	Well, it went down, so I don't know.
2382640	2388880	Just looking from a corporate point of view, they have a product there that they don't
2388880	2390560	want misperceptions on.
2390560	2394040	They want people to see it the way they want people to see it.
2394040	2397320	Not just with speculation.
2397320	2400780	It actually is a wise move on their part to go ahead and say, look, this is what we're
2400780	2401780	working on.
2401780	2404280	We're just going to pull back the curtain a little bit.
2404280	2410240	But not give us, and basically they've directed the speculation is what they've done.
2410240	2414680	I honestly think if you take a step back and just look at, you know, what people are talking
2414680	2418160	about, Twitter, sphere, whatever, good, bad, whatever, you know what they say, whether
2418160	2420940	they're talking bad or talking good, they're talking about you.
2420940	2427480	People by far out of this E3 are talking about Wii U and then probably in a distant second
2427480	2434080	the Vita, and then Microsoft doesn't even chart with what they showed.
2434080	2438400	I mean, to the gamers, yeah, I mean, Halo 4 I guess would be maybe like a way distant
2438400	2439400	third.
2439400	2440400	Whoopity shit.
2440400	2441800	That's what I say about Halo 4.
2441800	2444480	And I'm not knocking Microsoft.
2444480	2447920	I'm just saying they didn't show anything at the press conference that really has people
2447920	2448920	buzzing.
2448920	2451640	And of course they didn't show a new console.
2451640	2454720	Although they did show that whole cable TV thing, which I thought was going to be a lot
2454720	2456520	bigger deal than it seems to be.
2456520	2457520	But whatever.
2457520	2458520	Anyhow.
2458520	2464180	SJ100Matt says, if it was leaked out not on their terms, then it would have been misconstrued
2464180	2465180	and confused.
2465180	2467920	So what Jamie said.
2467920	2472400	GameGuru says, I'm not sure, it depends on if the Wii U's uniqueness can overshadow connect
2472400	2474040	among the casuals.
2474040	2479000	Doomplague in chat.orchester.com says, they needed to get the attention of publishers,
2479000	2480180	developers on board.
2480180	2483000	That was the whole point of showing the Wii U, in my opinion.
2483000	2484000	Alright, let's move on.
2484000	2485840	I want to talk about something that's not Nintendo.
2485840	2490640	I know it's a three hour show, but there's plenty of other news going on too.
2490640	2495480	Well, Bungie is celebrating their 20th anniversary.
2495480	2499620	And of course they're going to reveal some new things about Bungie, including this Bungie
2499620	2503120	aerospace thing that they've been teasing for a while.
2503120	2509060	Among that stuff, and actually I think it's available now, if you have an iOS device,
2509060	2515400	you can download an actual application that's free.
2515400	2516400	That's kind of neat.
2516400	2519080	It basically kind of ties in with the Bungie website.
2519080	2528120	It's called Bungie Mobile, and you can check out your stats for Reach and all sorts of
2528120	2529120	stuff.
2529120	2532200	You can sign up for giveaways and...
2532200	2533200	Downloading?
2533200	2534480	Yeah, different things like that.
2534480	2539920	I don't play a lot of Halo, so this isn't really something I'd download, but it's kind
2539920	2540920	of cool.
2540920	2544200	And it's free, and it's available right now, so Bungie Mobile.
2544200	2545200	Check it out.
2545200	2551920	Then of course, as something that's a little bit funny, part of this Halo Fest that's going
2551920	2559760	to be going on, I guess they're going to be showing off the Halo Combat Evolved HD.
2559760	2565040	And with that, they're going to have six custom-made Duke controllers.
2565040	2571600	Now you remember, the Duke controller is the original Xbox controller, the one that was
2571600	2574920	the size of a small single-family home.
2574920	2578640	The size of Duke Nukem's ego.
2578640	2582480	So they're going to have those made in a very limited run, and they're going to be auctioned
2582480	2583880	off as well.
2583880	2590760	And I guess Halo Fest will run alongside PAX Prime from Friday, August 26th to Sunday,
2590760	2595360	August 28th at the Washington State Convention Center.
2595360	2600720	Which, by the way, mission is free if you have your PAX badge.
2600720	2604240	If you want to go play with an original Xbox controller.
2604240	2605440	Yes.
2605440	2608440	And have your hands hurt after spending some time with them.
2608440	2613600	You may throw out your back lifting the controller.
2613600	2618000	DarkSakura, you hated those old Xbox controllers, didn't you?
2618000	2619880	Because my hands are smaller.
2619880	2624920	It really did, it was just painful after a while, but I mean, I can handle a big controller
2624920	2628560	as long as the ergonomics are reasonable.
2628560	2633440	Like, Saturn Dual Analog controller, you know, I've told everybody that's my favorite controller
2633440	2635760	ever, but it's kind of bulky.
2635760	2639720	But it fits reasonably in the hand, and that's the problem, is that my thumbs just won't
2639720	2643520	reach.
2643520	2646920	I never actually touched one of the original Xbox controllers.
2646920	2649200	By the time I bought an Xbox, I bought...
2649200	2650480	I could fix that.
2650480	2653440	I'm sure I've mentioned this on the show before, but when I bought an Xbox, I actually bought
2653440	2655040	a Halo Xbox.
2655040	2659000	It's a green, translucent kind of Xbox, it's very different from the other ones that are
2659000	2660000	out there.
2660000	2661000	That's the same one we have.
2661000	2662000	Oh yeah?
2662000	2665840	Yeah, they were limited edition or something, but it came with Halo.
2665840	2669560	So believe it or not, when I first played Halo, I loved it.
2669560	2672920	And yeah, I played it at a wedding.
2672920	2677840	My friends had got married, and it was a Halo kind of a very subtle Halo theme to the wedding.
2677840	2681600	And yeah, they were just those kinds of people where it was like, okay, we're married, let's
2681600	2682600	play Halo.
2682600	2685720	And everybody brought TVs, and it was like a local area thing, because obviously Xbox
2685720	2687040	Live wasn't on the first one.
2687040	2691280	Oh, like, do you know that that's exactly what my husband's bachelor party was?
2691280	2692280	Yeah.
2692280	2700440	Was cases of beer, about eight TVs set up all over my house, and lots of Halo land.
2700440	2703880	Meanwhile, you remember my party.
2703880	2704880	Let's watch Xana do and go drink.
2704880	2705880	I do, I do.
2705880	2706880	All right.
2706880	2711200	Going to our chat room at chat.orangelandsrader.com, Game Guru says, the Duke should be stricken
2711200	2712200	from memory.
2712200	2713800	Controller S was vastly superior.
2713800	2718520	SSJ100Matt says, the Dreamcast controller was bulky, but it was one of my favorite controllers.
2718520	2720480	I really liked the Dreamcast controller too.
2720480	2724680	I loved the whole idea of the VMUs.
2724680	2726840	It's kind of a bummer that didn't really stick.
2726840	2731240	I mean, I guess, ironically, some are saying that that's what the Wii U controllers are,
2731240	2732480	but they're really not.
2732480	2737440	They're kind of different, because you can't really take that controller and just take
2737440	2741960	it out by itself and do anything really with it, especially if you step too far away from
2741960	2743280	the Wii U box.
2743280	2746280	Anyhow, let's talk about free stuff.
2746280	2747280	That's right.
2747280	2748280	Free games, legal.
2748280	2749920	This whole thing's illegal free games.
2749920	2755920	If you're looking for something new to play, you need to look no further and pass Steam.
2755920	2760240	Steam has added five free-to-play games available on Steam.
2760240	2762720	You can download them just like anything else.
2762720	2765240	These are all like free-to-play MMOs.
2765240	2768400	The games are Spiral Knights, I should say free-to-play games.
2768400	2769880	They're not all necessarily MMOs.
2769880	2775600	Spiral Knights, Forsaken Worlds, Champions Online, Free For All, Global Agenda Free Agent,
2775600	2777200	and Alliance of Valiant Arms.
2777200	2780480	They are all on Steam right now available for you to download.
2780480	2782360	I know some people have been checking them out.
2782360	2785400	I've seen our webmaster, Deep Man, has been playing Spiral Knights.
2785400	2787320	I saw some of his pictures.
2787320	2790920	And they got to the point where it was like, hey, you want to keep playing the good stuff?
2790920	2792680	Now you got to give us money.
2792680	2798080	So that's the only bummer with the free-to-play games is that a lot of them really just feel
2798080	2804000	like extended demos, especially like what was that one on PlayStation 3 that was so
2804000	2805000	stupid?
2805000	2810000	Free Realms, the one where you can play as a fairy and everything is blocked off unless
2810000	2811000	you pay for it.
2811000	2812000	That's why I haven't downloaded anything.
2812000	2813400	They're just demos.
2813400	2814400	But I don't know.
2814400	2815720	Some people get more out of this.
2815720	2819480	I hear some of these other ones have a little more robust experience, like Champions Online
2819480	2820480	and Global Agenda.
2820480	2824000	A little more of the robust experience, but haven't played it myself.
2824000	2827440	But if you are looking for something new to try, maybe these things will be up your alley.
2827440	2828440	Check it out.
2828440	2831080	Well, I did go to try to find you one of my Xbox controllers.
2831080	2832080	Oh, really?
2832080	2833880	And I couldn't find it, but I did find this.
2833880	2834880	A Sega.
2834880	2835880	Now see, I never owned a Saturn.
2835880	2836880	The Saturn Dual Analog Controller.
2836880	2837880	I never owned a Saturn.
2837880	2838880	Now feel it.
2838880	2842040	This looks like a mini pizza the way the disc is.
2842040	2848040	Well, just hold it in both hands for a second, because now you see how natural it feels.
2848040	2849040	It actually feels super natural.
2849040	2851120	It's not super natural, but you know what I mean?
2851120	2853360	Really easy to do.
2853360	2860560	The D-pad's a little weird, kind of like it is on Xbox, but I really like this 360, the
2860560	2862080	hell's the name of these, the Analog.
2862080	2864760	In my opinion, it's the best controller ever made.
2864760	2867200	There you go.
2867200	2868200	Let me see.
2868200	2869480	Oh, Loki wants to touch it.
2869480	2873520	Well, while Loki's touching my controller, I'll go ahead and read the next story.
2873520	2875520	How's that sound?
2875520	2876520	Sure.
2876520	2878960	Zynga likes to sue people.
2878960	2884600	Well, now they have another company they're going after called Vostu.
2884600	2888560	It's a Brazilian company, and they are getting in on Cityville.
2888560	2891360	They have Vostu's Mega City.
2891360	2894740	And if you look at the screen captures, it's fairly identical, although I have to say that
2894740	2900760	some of Vostu's in-game sprites actually look a lot nicer.
2900760	2902760	But they are...
2902760	2904760	Excuse me.
2904760	2906680	You're right over there.
2906680	2907680	All right.
2907680	2911200	Hey, I told you I'm sick.
2911200	2917520	But they basically copied everything down, and this is actually in the complaint.
2917520	2924840	And I need to read this, because this is just, like, this is Zynga going, oh, you whore,
2924840	2925840	no way.
2925840	2931720	Vostu has brazenly appropriated the copyright protected aspects of Zynga's games, as well
2931720	2939160	as almost every other aspect of Zynga's business, with scant effort to mask their strategy.
2939160	2943440	And then offered games virtually identical to Zynga's games to prospective players in
2943440	2945640	the United States and elsewhere.
2945640	2953800	And they did actually side-by-side video with, you know, cleaning a pet, and the whole video
2953800	2957280	is here.
2957280	2964160	But they also copied mistakes, so it looks like they're actually copying code.
2964160	2970440	Things that were already bugs in the games.
2970440	2977680	And like, for example, there was one in Cityville where the requirement that the community buildings
2977680	2985560	be connected to a road to function, it actually was copied over as a bug into Vostu's game
2985560	2986960	too.
2986960	2990280	So there's, it looks like there's quite a bit going on.
2990280	2994800	The whole lawsuit actually is online.
2994800	3003680	So it looks like they're trying to get them to shut down operations, and if you also look
3003680	3013280	at the, they had to raise $45.9 million in funds, Vostu did, to get their thing going.
3013280	3017520	So I find this stuff kind of ironic, because didn't Zynga kind of get their start copying
3017520	3018520	other people's games?
3018520	3021280	Like, isn't Farmville taken from Farm Town or something?
3021280	3030800	Well now, here's the other thing, looking at the company's stats too, is that Vostu
3030800	3038840	was founded February 1st, 2007, Zynga was founded July 2007, with more money behind
3038840	3039840	them.
3039840	3040840	Interesting.
3040840	3046960	And Vostu was located in New York, where Zynga is located in San Francisco.
3046960	3047960	So fairly interesting.
3047960	3050200	It's an East Coast, West Coast thing.
3050200	3051200	That's right.
3051200	3057400	It's gonna go down, and it's all gonna go down in Cityville.
3057400	3059760	There's gonna be drive-by shootings and things.
3059760	3065600	They're just gonna have to prove, it's basically gonna come down to which code is older, you
3065600	3066600	know?
3066600	3077360	But yeah, looking at these photos, and I'll show the chatroom too, it's pretty identical.
3077360	3082520	Basically Zynga feels pretty confident in this, or they wouldn't be suing, so, you know.
3082520	3087280	I just find it ironic that it's Zynga accusing someone else of being evil.
3087280	3093880	So, I'm really sick and tired of Facebook games that keep wanting you to publish shit
3093880	3096400	and click like and all this stuff.
3096400	3097400	It's just such garbage.
3097400	3101360	You know, there's more of this shit going on too, you remember what I was telling you
3101360	3107840	about on the way to Disneyland, about WTF Forever 21, the blog.
3107840	3113520	This girl basically was just like, you know, pointing out stuff in the Forever 21 catalog
3113520	3117360	that was ugly, and you know, blogging about it.
3117360	3124320	And they're saying that she's copying their stuff, and Forever 21 is a big copier of actual
3124320	3129360	designers like Anna Sui and, you know, big name designers.
3129360	3131600	So I thought that was really hilarious.
3131600	3135680	But it's been, I mean, I can name other companies though that are doing the same thing that's
3135680	3143880	basically like, you know, oh well, we're going to get you for doing nothing that's like what
3143880	3144880	we're doing.
3144880	3147760	Breakman in our chatroom takes issue with your story, DarkSakura.
3147760	3151660	He says, whatever, those two games are completely different.
3151660	3155880	One is using a completely different shade of brown than the other.
3155880	3158080	It all comes down to the source code.
3158080	3159840	It all comes down to the source code.
3159840	3160840	We'll see.
3160840	3164360	All right, anyhow, we're going to move on and cover some release dates and check out
3164360	3167640	what is coming out to a gaming store near you very soon.
3167640	3170320	We'll start off in, sorry, US.
3170320	3172340	In the US state of Japan.
3172340	3175360	That's why I almost said Japan because I was bringing up my Japanese dates, but we're not
3175360	3176360	starting there.
3176360	3179480	So actually, some decent stuff this week.
3179480	3186880	Not a whole lot though, I mean, it's still, still a slow time of the year.
3186880	3192880	Some EA though, and this is kind of cool, it's kind of a collaboration between, I want
3192880	3203000	to say, Suda51 and the guy that created Resident Evil, and basically it's Shadows of the Damned,
3203000	3211160	kind of a grindhouse-ish, I kind of call it like a grindhouse-ish Dante's Inferno game.
3211160	3212160	It's pretty awesome.
3212160	3217880	So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3217880	3227400	Also I believe that they are re-releasing, in case you don't have Call of Duty Black
3227400	3233840	Ops, you can get Call of Duty Black Ops now with the first download pack with that, so
3233840	3239000	that's going to be out there for 60 bucks as well.
3239000	3246680	And then also this week we've got Dungeon Siege 3, that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
3246680	3247680	and PC.
3247680	3257320	Today, or I believe actually no later this week, Wii Play Motion will be coming out from
3257320	3263280	Nintendo, and that of course is not a mini-game collection of course, because why would they
3263280	3268320	throw tech demos into a game, that will also be coming out with the Wii Remote Plus.
3268320	3272080	Cars 2, the video game, tying in with the upcoming movie, it's on all major formats,
3272080	3278120	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3278120	3286320	Also Gods and Heroes of Rome Rising, that's coming out on PC.
3286320	3295320	There's some PSP 2 packs that are coming out, kind of some cheap games, Kills and Liberation,
3295320	3302000	Siphon Filters Logan Challenge, that's on PSP for $14.99, not bad.
3302000	3311360	And then also they have a couple other collections this week as well, let's see here, I'll get
3311360	3312360	back to that.
3312360	3322200	Anyways, Fear 3 also this week, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
3322200	3329360	Arma 2 Reinforcements on PC, Dual Pen Sports on the 3DS, which I'm not sure how that works
3329360	3333000	considering that the 3DS is not multi-touch.
3333000	3341160	Pets Fantasy for the 3DS, yes now bringing the ever loved Pets franchise to the 3DS.
3341160	3342160	Thank you Ubisoft.
3342160	3343160	Yay.
3343160	3345360	Yeah I know everyone's excited about that.
3345360	3356120	And let's see, I believe that's actually it, a week from today I believe Mystery Case Files
3356120	3364480	the Malgrave Incident from Nintendo, in case you like that on the DS.
3364480	3368880	Alright moving over to Japan and looking at what is coming out on the Japanese releases
3368880	3373760	this week, coming out on June 23rd, which by the way also happens to be the 9th birthday
3373760	3375840	of OLR, June 23rd.
3375840	3380040	Grand Theft Auto IV, the complete edition coming out in Japan, might seem a little late
3380040	3383680	but I believe those releases are localized for Japan so they have to go back and redo
3383680	3385720	the text and the acting and all that stuff.
3385720	3389920	So that is coming out finally this week, that is the big release on Xbox 360.
3389920	3393960	Coming out on PlayStation 3 this week on the 23rd, some more choices for you.
3393960	3398100	Mass Effect 2, the Japanese release is out this week as well as of course the Grand Theft
3398100	3399640	Auto IV collection.
3399640	3404640	Bleach Soul Ignition out from Sony this week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
3404640	3412160	And lastly a game called Meru no Atlier, Arland no Reken Jutsuji comes out this week from
3412160	3416000	Gust, and I don't know if this is a game that is out here.
3416000	3417000	Yes it is.
3417000	3418000	Is it?
3418000	3419000	What is this?
3419000	3424240	Is this the, oh Atlier, they do have the Atlier series out here, so this is like a role playing
3424240	3425240	game.
3425240	3428180	I think we have one of these at home we haven't played yet, like the last one in the series.
3428180	3430680	That's on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3430680	3433100	And then moving on to some of the other consoles.
3433100	3440680	Going to the Nintendo Wii this week, actually let me do the PSP first, Gloria Union this
3440680	3446680	week and Gundam Memories, Tataki no Kyoku comes out this week.
3446680	3449560	And trying to see if there's anything on the Wii.
3449560	3454200	Earth Seeker comes out this week, sorry that is not the same thing as Earthbound, but there
3454200	3457720	is a game called Earth Seeker that's coming out this week.
3457720	3463280	This looks like kind of like an RPG-ish type of game, but with the Wii graphics.
3463280	3466040	Whatever happened to The Last Guardian, I thought they were going to announce that at
3466040	3467040	E3 this year for the Wii.
3467040	3470040	That's supposed to be a kick-ass game on the Wii.
3470040	3471640	From The Last Guardian?
3471640	3475040	No not The Last Guardian, dammit no, I'm thinking that's the PlayStation 3.
3475040	3476360	What am I thinking of?
3476360	3478120	There's some big role playing game from Mistwalker.
3478120	3479120	Last Story.
3479120	3480120	Thank you, Last Story.
3480120	3483120	One word difference.
3483120	3484120	Completely different games though.
3484120	3485760	Yeah sorry, my bad.
3485760	3492920	All right, Nintendo 3DS Japan this week, Fish Eyes 3D, at least it's not Fish Heads 3D,
3492920	3497720	Fish Eyes 3D and Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions come out this week.
3497720	3501160	Fishing games are huge in Japan, I'm telling you, this is what Fish Eyes is, it's a fishing
3501160	3502160	game.
3502160	3506440	And it looks like it takes like real scenes, like this very tranquil little lake in the
3506440	3510640	woods and then you can just rope in these dead fish.
3510640	3512720	Well who would want to rope in dead fish?
3512720	3516720	Oh no, you rope them in while they're alive and kicking and then they die when they're
3516720	3518960	sitting in the styrofoam container.
3518960	3521880	All the radiation in the water killed them.
3521880	3524320	Kidding, I'm kidding, gosh, gosh, all right.
3524320	3525320	That's very insensitive of you.
3525320	3528560	I was completely insensitive, but all right, let's move on.
3528560	3534080	Okay, on the 24th we have Dream Trigger 3D for 3DS, this is their UK releases.
3534080	3542500	Fear 3 for PlayStation 3 PC, Xbox 360, Get Fit with Mel B, Who Cares, Gods and Heroes
3542500	3549080	Room Rising, Let's Dance with Mel B, Who Else Cares, Shadows of the Damned, Call of Duty
3549080	3555480	Black Ops Annihilation Pack, sorry that was the 28th, my bad, done.
3555480	3557920	All right, it's a quick week.
3557920	3561620	Some more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer takes
3561620	3565200	a stroll through the classic game archives and she will in just a moment.
3565200	3569080	I could not find my controller by the way, I tried to find you an old controller.
3569080	3574280	I melted it down and made two of the other controllers out of it.
3574280	3575280	I think we actually did get rid of them.
3575280	3576280	I don't know.
3576280	3577280	All right, moving on.
3577280	3582720	Melted it down to two full-size station wagons.
3582720	3586640	So since we were talking about lawsuits with Zynga, let's talk about lawsuits with Infinity
3586640	3587640	Ward and Activision.
3587640	3592800	Yeah, I remember them, they were suing each other back and forth and good luck for both
3592800	3598140	of them because both lawsuits in either direction were approved.
3598140	3607120	So the lawsuit filed against Activision by Infinity Ward is moving forward and I guess
3607120	3609760	that the claims have merit.
3609760	3614080	Also apparently the judge has allowed the countersuit to move forward as well.
3614080	3618880	So it'll be interesting to see how that pans out.
3618880	3625600	And then since we're talking about Activision here and everybody loves Bobby Kotick, Bobby
3625600	3643280	Kotick actually has a cameo as I guess a manager of a baseball team in Moneyball, the new Brad
3643280	3646080	Pitt movie about the Oakland A's.
3646080	3651160	Wait, wait, they made a movie about the Oakland A's?
3651160	3652160	Yeah.
3652160	3653160	Why?
3653160	3659000	Because there was this coach that came in and changed the way they do drafting or whatever
3659000	3660600	and it was a big deal.
3660600	3662640	Why don't they make a movie about a good baseball team?
3662640	3666640	Why don't they make a movie about the Giants?
3666640	3668440	Field of Dreams.
3668440	3673000	A League of Their Own.
3673000	3676400	I'd be more interested in seeing A League of Their Own again and watching a movie about
3676400	3681200	the Oakland A's.
3681200	3685720	Moving on, one more story for you guys and this has been all over the press this week.
3685720	3690360	I'm sure you guys have heard, but some of your favorite gaming websites were hacked.
3690360	3695720	That's right, Bethesda was hacked earlier this week and yeah, Bethesda apparently had
3695720	3700200	200,000 user accounts compromised there.
3700200	3704440	So yeah, be careful if you were a member of Bethesda's forums.
3704440	3710120	Also the same hackers took down Minecraft, Eve Online, and the Escapist Magazine.
3710120	3714680	A lot of this was from denial of service attacks, a very popular way to bring down websites
3714680	3715680	out there.
3715680	3720640	Eve Online was taken offline for several hours as was the Escapist Magazine online.
3720640	3724240	I think Minecraft was down for a little bit, but they came back up pretty quick.
3724240	3730280	So just good rule of thumb here, the same hacker group released I think 62,000 login
3730280	3733000	and passwords.
3733000	3740420	Don't use the same password on Bethesda's website or Square Enix's forums or whatever
3740420	3742640	gaming forums you log into.
3742640	3746360	Don't use the same password there that you use on PayPal.
3746360	3751560	This is a real chance for you to evaluate the passwords that you use and we kind of
3751560	3755360	throw this out there as a warning to those out there that don't want to end up in the
3755360	3760720	same boat because you know what we say on the show, I'm not condoning what these guys
3760720	3766040	are doing, but you know the old saying, hackers are going to hack and for whatever the reason,
3766040	3769800	whether it be they're trying to make a point or trying to steal money or whatever it is.
3769800	3776600	So just make sure you don't use the same password for your banking that you do on the
3776600	3779040	Orange Islands Radio forums even.
3779040	3785060	Because I'll tell you what, PHPBB is what we use and what a lot of different websites
3785060	3789820	use and if you, those things I'm sure can get hacked pretty easy.
3789820	3794040	So don't use the same password on anything like that that you would use for your bank
3794040	3795040	or your PayPal.
3795040	3797400	Have different passwords.
3797400	3799520	This public service announcement brought to you by us.
3799520	3800520	Yes.
3800520	3804360	Alright, moving on, let's get into some classic gaming.
3804360	3807360	We're going to take a stroll down memory lane.
3807360	3812220	DarkSakura has picked a classic game or games as the case may be tonight that she's going
3812220	3814440	to highlight as the classic game of the week.
3814440	3820240	It's the one and only true love for this week in gaming.
3820240	3823360	DarkSakura, what should the kids out there be playing this week?
3823360	3824360	Contra.
3824360	3825800	I selected the Contra series.
3825800	3828920	Right, because I think you did the Contra game a while ago, but now we've got the whole
3828920	3829920	damn series.
3829920	3833440	Okay, I don't remember doing Contra, but okay.
3833440	3838360	So yeah, basically it's, the series started in 1987.
3838360	3844000	It's a run and gun style shooter and it came out as Contra and then we had the really super
3844000	3848320	Contra in 1988 and a bunch of other Contras.
3848320	3854880	And now this is actually just my old Japanese studies that makes me pretty giddy is that
3854880	3862400	it was, in Japanese it was written out in Ateji which is like using the kanji but for
3862400	3864400	their pronunciation.
3864400	3869200	So I thought it was pretty interesting.
3869200	3875240	And it actually, the first one came out after, the arcade one, came out after the I ran Contra
3875240	3879760	affair and people were like, well is this about that?
3879760	3882520	And there was an ending theme, it was called Sandinista.
3882520	3887560	I don't know if anyone remembers the whole Contras and Sandinista thing.
3887560	3889720	I remember it.
3889720	3891840	So yeah.
3891840	3898440	The original is side scrolling but you've got a few 3D view areas is what they were
3898440	3903400	called where it's behind you and then a couple of overhead ones like in Super Contra and
3903400	3906200	Contra 3 the Alien Wars.
3906200	3913080	There, the ones that deviated were the ones that were done by Appaloosa which was Contra
3913080	3918200	like Sea of War, Sea of the Contra Adventure and Neo Contra.
3918200	3925880	Contra Shattered Soldier had the side view but it was all rendered in 3D.
3925880	3932680	And then basically they were all two player except for the MSX2 version of Contra and
3932680	3934200	Operation Sea for the Gameboy.
3934200	3936720	Those were only single player.
3936720	3943880	So you get different weapons and you can replace your regular gun with a laser gun or a spread
3943880	3949200	gun, rapid bullets, they increase your fire speed.
3949200	3955640	You can also get the mega shell in Super Contra or bombs in Contra 3 and Contra hardcore.
3955640	3961680	There's all kinds of neat stuff but the biggest thing about Contra is that it was hard and
3961680	3965120	for the record the NES version of Contra does use the Konami code.
3965120	3968000	It gives you 30 lives instead of 3.
3968000	3970960	Probably the most infamous game to use the Konami code because you couldn't really beat
3970960	3971960	it without it.
3971960	3974720	I mean let's be real.
3974720	3980540	Most of the other ones had the extra lives codes in the Japanese releases such as Contra
3980540	3984140	Spirits which was Contra 3 over here and Contra hardcore.
3984140	3991960	So the games in the series we have Contra which is on Arcade, MSX2, DOS, C64, CPC, ZX
3991960	3998280	and then Super Contra, Arcade, NES, DOS and Amiga, Operation Sea on Gameboy, Contra 3
3998280	4005400	the Alien Wars which was SNES, Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, Contra Force on the NES, Contra hardcore
4005400	4010320	which was on Genesis slash Mega Drive, Contra Legacy of War on Playstation and Saturn which
4010320	4014520	I think we have the Saturn one of that I want to say.
4014520	4019480	See the Contra Adventure on Playstation, Contra Shattered Soldier on PS2, Neo Contra on PS2,
4019480	4022120	Contra 4 on Nintendo DS.
4022120	4029040	That was done by WayForward technology and it actually had two screens that you know
4029040	4034040	because it was a DS you had different kinds of views that you could use.
4034040	4042040	There was Contra Rebirth that was done by M2 for WiiWare and Hardcore Uprising which
4042040	4048080	was on PS3, Xbox 360 and that's a downloadable title released this year.
4048080	4055120	There were re-releases of Contra and Super Contra, there were DOS ports, there was the
4055120	4065440	Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 is the X Spectrum and in Europe it came out as Gryzor.
4065440	4069920	There are actually mobile phone versions to Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade.
4069920	4076280	As far as cancelled games there was Contra Spirit 64 which was in development by Konami
4076280	4084200	of Osaka however it was cancelled when the development team disbanded and that was being
4084200	4086240	worked on in 1998.
4086240	4095640	For other ones, I love this game Konami YY World which is on Famicom, it actually had
4095640	4101400	the same boss theme that was used in the original Contra and it came out right before Contra.
4101400	4111160	YY World 2, SOS, Parsley Joe, Bill Rizer is a playable character in there, Snatcher.
4111160	4117160	The two characters Bill and Lance go to a Konami themed party held at the Outer Heaven
4117160	4125400	Show Pub and they are replaced by Light and Pastel from Twinbee but in the 32 bit version
4125400	4128240	of the game there's a Contra ad in there.
4128240	4132760	There's Nanobreaker, Jaguar from Neocontra is a hidden character, Best Student Council
4132760	4140260	which is a TV anime produced by Konami, there was a character called Lance Bean who was
4140260	4144200	a mod to a Contra character.
4144200	4155760	Palaparokun Pocket 8 had a Contra parody in it, Silent Hill Shattered Memories is in a
4155760	4161680	movie theater that has Konami arcade machines including the original Contra and if you make
4161680	4168160	care you stare at it he'll go some real classics and then Rocket Knight when you play as Gold
4168160	4176680	Sparkster it has Bill Rizer shooting the spread gun at Gold Sparkster when he flies away.
4176680	4182480	These were all set in the 27th century, well the initial Contra and the sequels had Bill
4182480	4188520	Rizer and Lance Bean who were modeled after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone
4188520	4194640	and then they were named after actors that were in Aliens as in Bill Paxton and Paul
4194640	4203080	Rizer so and then Lance Henriksen and Michael Bean for Lance Bean so I thought that was
4203080	4209080	neat and then after that it sort of deviated and had different people and then Contra Shattered
4209080	4216680	Soldier brought back Bill Rizer who was a war criminal and then Neocontra also had him
4216680	4221920	in there too but it was a clone, oh well, spoilers!
4221920	4232480	As far as differences in the different versions there were some changes in between the Japanese
4232480	4239400	and US ones mostly in character naming and who the characters were supposed to be and
4239400	4245620	there were also different you know bad guys who were named different like the Red Falcon
4245620	4253800	was actually the Tenoki Gabba was what his name was, the Emperor Demon Gabba and then
4253800	4260800	there was Mad Dog and Scorpion were given to Bill and Lance in the NES versions.
4260800	4268320	When it came out in Europe and Australia it was called Probotector and they were robots
4268320	4277240	so they weren't Bill and Lance and then different versions came out as I said earlier as Gryzor
4277240	4282800	and then Super Protector Alien Rebels which is Contra through the Alien Wars.
4282800	4292480	For Game Boy they were also put out as Probotector and then the Wii versions were released as
4292480	4302200	Probotector in the UK, Contra 4 did not get released in Europe but Probotector was in
4302200	4306040	the game as in character so that's it.
4306040	4307360	Good Lord that's a lot of Contra!
4307360	4308360	Yeah.
4308360	4310520	But it's a great series, hard as hell.
4310520	4311520	No seriously.
4311520	4314640	But very rewarding if you can actually make your way through the games so.
4314640	4315640	Seriously.
4315640	4318720	Alright we're going to take a break guys but don't go anywhere because we're going to be

4359960	4365040	It's going to be June 26th, 2011 and that's the closest show to our 9th birthday as a
4365040	4369160	station June 23rd or I should say as a show.
4369160	4372280	We used to have a station on Life is Five but then of course we folded that a few years
4372280	4373280	ago.
4373280	4375320	Hence our new home at All Games which we like.
4375320	4378740	So yeah, that is all going to be next week.
4378740	4384480	Not doing anything special guys, 9 is like a weird number and you know we thought maybe
4384480	4387560	it would be better to save something really cool for 10 years.
4387560	4389320	We should open up with rum stain.
4389320	4393440	We're hoping we can get like a guest or something you know to come in and have fun with us but
4393440	4395600	we're not really planning on anything like super huge.
4395600	4399580	There just comes a point where celebrating too much is just too much.
4399580	4404720	Like okay, we had a 5 year show, we had a 300, a 400, you know 9 years, whatever.
4404720	4406840	So that's that.
4406840	4409120	So we'll be here next week of course with that.
4409120	4413200	If you wanted to wish us happy birthday, a great way to do that of course would be to
4413200	4417360	rate us on iTunes with a 5 star review because that helps other people notice the show or
4417360	4418360	just spread the word.
4418360	4420640	We always say at the end of the show, spread the word about the show.
4420640	4421640	Send a tweet.
4421640	4425440	I saw somebody made a very nice Facebook post this week pointing us to the Orange Lounge
4425440	4426440	Radio Facebook.
4426440	4427440	I thought that was great.
4427440	4429280	So all that stuff always really helps.
4429280	4430280	It goes a long way.
4430280	4434980	During the break, Loki was asking me about why didn't I mention Child of Eden during
4434980	4438800	my gaming week because I've made it no secret on the show before.
4438800	4445520	I'm a huge fan of Q and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, obviously the Reds, Space Channel, Luminous,
4445520	4448720	shit I even loved every extent Extra Extreme.
4448720	4452700	I still say 99 Nights wasn't as bad as y'all made it out to be but maybe that's a little
4452700	4453960	bit of fanboy isn't there.
4453960	4456040	But I did not play Child of Eden this week.
4456040	4460000	Long story short, I was basically reminded that I had a birthday coming up and maybe
4460000	4463140	I shouldn't make any game purchases until my birthday has passed.
4463140	4466600	For those that don't know, my birthday happens to also be next Sunday.
4466600	4470480	My birthday was 3 days after the original OLR on June 23rd.
4470480	4472120	So yeah, my birthday is right around this time too.
4472120	4476440	So I have to wait until then and then maybe there will be a gift card or something I can
4476440	4478120	use to go get it.
4478120	4481000	But Loki and I were talking a little bit about some of the reviews and things we've heard
4481000	4485740	about the game and how some people are dog and child of Eden for being only 90 minutes.
4485740	4490440	Now I hear it, again, I haven't played it, I can only go off what I've heard and my intense
4490440	4494400	bias towards Q and everything that Tetsuya Mizuguchi touches.
4494400	4497760	But I hear it's an amazing 90 minutes.
4497760	4499760	Like that it's just like a great 90 minutes a game.
4499760	4501600	They said it will bring you to tears.
4501600	4502880	It will bring you to tears.
4502880	4507840	Well the original Rez was an amazing game too and it was probably only about 90 minutes.
4507840	4510240	Now granted games didn't cost 60 bucks back then.
4510240	4514560	The only thing that brings me to tears is the fact that I forgot to send in Josh's picture
4514560	4517800	when they were doing picture submissions because that would have been awesome.
4517800	4520000	I didn't even realize, I forgot that was there.
4520000	4524960	So I've been trying to stay spoiler free so please don't spoil or whatever.
4524960	4529040	But Loki and I were kind of talking a little bit about the whole 90 minutes thing and Loki
4529040	4533160	you feel that 90 minutes, paying 60 bucks for a 90 minute experience is okay.
4533160	4539640	Which is funny to hear from you because usually you're the first one to dog people that are
4539640	4541520	wanting to price gouge and all that stuff.
4541520	4546040	But if it's a damn good 90 minutes then it might be worth the cost, right?
4546040	4547040	Exactly.
4547040	4550920	I mean the way I look at it is like shooters.
4550920	4554280	Shooters that are out there, I'm not talking about first person shooters, I'm talking about
4554280	4555720	arcade games.
4555720	4562360	They're not 30 hours long, they're like a few hours if that.
4562360	4565720	It's a full fleshed out game.
4565720	4570940	You don't need a whole lot of story with this stuff so you don't need to spend extra time
4570940	4577740	for story development and whatnot but if it's a good entertaining 90 minutes it's better
4577740	4582120	than a boring 6 hours or a boring 30 hours.
4582120	4585680	I mean you might spend 60 bucks to go to an awesome concert.
4585680	4591720	Like I probably spent over 100 bucks to go see Lady Gaga and that was a pretty awesome
4591720	4593960	90 minutes.
4593960	4599200	But all joking aside, obviously reviewers are going to react differently and so forth.
4599200	4602640	But see that's the thing, that's my problem with some of these reviewers nowadays, it's
4602640	4609320	like they kind of forgot how games were or they forgot how things are.
4609320	4612800	They're like oh this isn't as good as Call of Duty so I don't like it.
4612800	4613960	I don't understand that.
4613960	4617420	Let me play devil's advocate a little bit here though is that the game marketplace isn't
4617420	4618680	what it used to be.
4618680	4622640	And to be fair there's a lot of games out there that have intense replayability value
4622640	4625080	that go for 99 cents like Angry Birds.
4625080	4629520	I understand that but at the same time you can't judge a first person shooter by the
4629520	4632240	same criteria as a music game.
4632240	4636800	I mean they have different intents and purposes and I think comparing-
4636800	4637980	I thought you said it was a shooter.
4637980	4638980	What is it?
4638980	4640240	Is it a shooter or is it a music game?
4640240	4641840	No it's not a first person shooter.
4641840	4644840	That's different.
4644840	4648720	You can judge first person shooters against other first person shooters and granted you
4648720	4655800	can judge different elements of it like this has good production value and stuff like that.
4655800	4664560	But you can't say oh because this shooter slash music game is not like as long as Final
4664560	4669600	Fantasy 13 well I'm going to have to rate it lower or something.
4669600	4674100	But see once again though it kind of- here's the way I look at it.
4674100	4680520	If you're looking to reviews and reviewers for you know your decision on whether you
4680520	4682440	purchase a game or not here's what you need to do.
4682440	4689200	You need to search out reviews for games that you like or games that you have interest in
4689200	4694960	and find the reviewers that are sharing your same dislikes or likes with these games and
4694960	4698960	when you find a reviewer that kind of thinks like you do then you'll know whether to trust
4698960	4703040	that person's opinion or not because at the end of the day you know an IGN review that's
4703040	4707640	one person's opinion that's one person's opinion that you're holding so much weight against
4707640	4713800	because it's IGN.com it's one dude I mean hell if I said I hate this game I hate Madden
4713800	4716960	does that mean Madden is terrible no it doesn't mean Madden is terrible means I don't like
4716960	4722920	Madden a perfect example Minecraft we have all said on the show we don't understand Minecraft
4722920	4727720	like I've tried to play Minecraft and I was like this is not fun for me but I looked at
4727720	4733520	it and I went I see how it's fun for someone else but like someone with more of that you
4733520	4739440	know creative mind that wants to build things and and so forth I was like I was I was done
4739440	4743880	with Minecraft it's like people rating movie tie-in games it's like people rating children's
4743880	4748040	games they don't fucking care because they're like I don't want to rate you know I don't
4748040	4752400	want to be reviewing the Green Lantern game when I could be playing you know something
4752400	4757580	way better than this and so a lot of times it seems like that that comes out it's not
4757580	4763960	a unbiased opinion and sometimes I think that they just dog on the game so badly because
4763960	4770040	it's funny and people will you know link to that article some page it's just because you
4770040	4774920	know such as the websites that gave Duke Nukem Forever a zero like you know I again I haven't
4774920	4780720	played Duke Nukem Forever but a zero like I don't think I can trust a website they get
4780720	4784760	I mean again I haven't played it so maybe I need to bite my tongue but I just kind of
4784760	4789000	get the sense even from the demo I played I can't possibly imagine I could trust a website
4789000	4793480	that gave Fusion Frenzy 2 a higher score than Duke Nukem Forever because Fusion Frenzy 2
4793480	4799520	is the worst game I've played this generation and and also you know just some once again
4799520	4804080	like I said it's it's all about whether Bomberman 0 I take that back Bomberman 0 is the worst
4804080	4808960	game I played this generation it's all about you know whether you agree with the person
4808960	4813240	who's reviewing stuff like there are certain video movie reviewers out there that you may
4813240	4818000	have you may share the same opinion with you know Roger Deibert as opposed to some other
4818000	4824880	guy you know or vice versa I mean it it's all about finding the reviewer that you know
4824880	4830840	it makes sense to you or or what you can do is instead of worrying about wasting a lot
4830840	4835260	of money you know what guess what you can go now to red box machines and you can rent
4835260	4840120	a game for two dollars for a night so you know what you can get a taste of the game
4840120	4844360	or you can play a demo or you can rent it at a you know traditional video rental place
4844360	4848600	or you can do it through Gamefly or wherever and you don't spend you know sixty dollars
4848600	4853360	on a game you can check it out and if you like it cool you buy it if not then you didn't
4853360	4857880	waste that much money let me get some comments from chat.orangelaunceter.com as we are taping
4857880	4861740	live on this Sunday night break man in our chat room says for 90 minutes of fun a hooker
4861740	4865720	would charge you a lot more money so this is actually a good deal speaking of child
4865720	4869320	of Eden that's right I did learn how to learn that from watching cat house girls is that
4869320	4874000	the Air Force Amy or whatever her name was would charge probably several hundred dollars
4874000	4879720	for 90 minutes of fun. I have a feeling that the people in that cat house charge a lot
4879720	4885800	more than your traditional hooker because they're you know in Vegas and shit but yes
4885800	4890780	no no that was that was the bunny ranch that was that's a past Reno oh my mistake well
4890780	4895080	still Nevada I mean they figure people gambling have a lot of money so we could drive to the
4895080	4902200	bunny ranch we should we should take your wife out to the bunny ranch someday she one
4902200	4909480	of her aspirations in life was to get a prostitution license at some point for for Nevada just
4909480	4921480	that just to have a hard and put it you know so you know oh boy I and to read Saddam Hussein's
4921480	4928400	romance novels that he wrote those are two of her aspirations I think your wife needs
4928400	4932600	a podcast like not about games but I think your wife just needs a podcast called like
4932600	4938180	Nellie streams and every week she could talk about a dream of hers a lot of the stuff that
4938180	4941720	we talk about ends up on Facebook anyways especially if we say something funny like
4941720	4946520	last night I was saying something to her and to her a lot of the stuff I say sounds like
4946520	4955200	mumbling and so she'll say you said this or you know it's usually said you called me an
4955200	4961000	n-word no no that's not what I said at all I don't remember what the hell I actually
4961000	4967680	said it was not even close all right let's move on we're gonna get to some rapid fire
4967680	4972280	news but first we always like to plug the other projects if you enjoy Orange Lounge
4972280	4980600	Radio you might also enjoy Comic Insanity we have a podcast up every Tuesday on infamous.net
4980600	4988480	and F-A-M-O-U-S.net and we talk comics and other geeky stuffs so tune in it's me and
4988480	4994400	Tara and Dan Jeddo and I saw some of you in chat saying that I'm dogging on Warcraft which
4994400	4998200	I don't think I am really but then on the other token I turn around and I play World
4998200	5003000	of Warcraft which isn't for everyone and that's fine I understand that game isn't for everyone
5003000	5006680	but if you think it might be for you or it is for you you should check out the best little
5006680	5012680	Horde house in Azeroth Hordehouse.com that's the show I do with Xtaphir about the World
5012680	5016560	of Warcraft it's put out every week except last week because I was doing double duty
5016560	5021440	here for E3 but we did come back with episode 29 this week and it was a lot of fun talking
5021440	5027080	about the upcoming patch that still has not come out that may not come out on Tuesday
5027080	5033240	after all the lots of WoW stuff and Warcraft discussion going on there Hordehouse.com alright
5033240	5037520	let's move on and get into some rapid fire news lots of new gaming stories throughout
5037520	5040920	the week we don't always have time to spend five minutes on all of them let's talk quickly
5040920	5045000	about some of the things you might otherwise miss Loki so EA is trying something out they
5045000	5052200	decided to open a retail store for EA Sports in the Charlotte Airport and of course you
5052200	5057200	know if you've been to airports they have a lot of stores you can waste money and time
5057200	5061280	in because you know people are waiting for their flights especially when they're told
5061280	5065720	to get to the airports you know three hours early or two hours early and oh guess what
5065720	5069520	that security line wasn't as long as they said it was and now you have to hang around
5069520	5074120	and maybe you need some gifts for your friends and whatnot so they're going to be doing that
5074120	5081440	and I guess kind of as a test to see if this is something that would take off other places
5081440	5086080	I don't know it's a neat idea but I don't think you're going to see this really anywhere
5086080	5093880	else because you know everybody carries EA Sports stuff so I don't know but I mean those
5093880	5101100	theme type stores are pretty popular in airports so makes sense now this is kind of interesting
5101100	5105920	never thought I would see a sequel to this game but apparently Namco is doing a new Namco
5105920	5112000	Generations game and that game is Dancing Eyes and Dancing Eyes was an arcade game it
5112000	5118120	came out I think in the 2000s is basically kind of I think it was based on like the Playstation
5118120	5124600	1 or something like that but it was a 3D poly kind of a almost like a gals panic or kicks
5124600	5130640	type game you had a grid that was around usually a woman or it could be something funny and
5130640	5136840	as you you know connected the dots or connected the lines around a shape that shape would
5136840	5141840	disappear and reveal either the scantily clad woman underneath or you know in some cases
5141840	5148640	a cow or a person or who knows titties no there were there was no nudity in any of these
5148640	5153640	games but after you did get done though you got the they played the you know the kind
5153640	5162480	of burlesque horn music or whatever oh it's like Sharon Christine Aguilera something like
5162480	5169920	that and so they're going to be putting out a new game now for the Namco Generations he
5169920	5174560	used to play this game at Arcade Infinity actually I did play this and I actually have
5174560	5179600	it on my arcade cabinet at home I played I've played it in MAME and it's fun it's it's it's
5179600	5188280	not you know it's not an adult game I mean it's sort of could I guess it's it's PG-13
5188280	5195520	yeah I mean you reveal like women wearing bikinis or you know a girl dressed up like
5195520	5199880	a cat you know a cat girl or something oh my gosh not a cat girl you're playing as a
5199880	5206520	monkey and you run around you're trying to avoid you know different enemies that are
5206520	5210760	running around the screen stuff so you're supposed to dodge them and they actually have
5210760	5216880	some screenshots here see it's basically just you know running around like a woman's you
5216880	5223200	know shirt and it's revealing her bra underneath so that's coming out in PlayStation 3 oh 96
5223200	5231960	is when it came out in the arcade that was 2000 but neat also they're going to be doing
5231960	5241760	a game of or a new version of Metro Cross as Arrow Cross I guess so that's kind of neat
5241760	5246360	and then finally I guess this is good news for people that are looking for a new Psychonauts
5246360	5254880	game but Double Fine is now obtaining the rights to publish a new Psychonauts game and
5254880	5262560	of course you know it came out back in 05 and Tim Schafer you know says Double Fine's
5262560	5268120	always owned the intellectual property rights for Psychonauts franchise but we've and we
5268120	5273380	so we've been free to pursue movies sequels etc says what changed recently is the publishing
5273380	5277960	rights to the game Psychonauts have reverted to Double Fine and some of the deals still
5277960	5282760	need to be finalized this means anything financially when that happens we'll have more to announce
5282760	5292880	so all right neat well moving on to Xbox Live you might have caught the indie games uprising
5292880	5297600	last winter it was a way for the indie games on Xbox Live to get more exposure in fact
5297600	5301560	there was a little bit of back and forth because it was something that the community kind of
5301560	5305200	came up with the Microsoft at first didn't really support it but they finally came around
5305200	5309480	and they did kind of give it some ad space and so forth calling attention to it well
5309480	5313960	it's coming back for the summer it's going to start on August 22nd and run through September
5313960	5319840	12th two games will be released each week and it's all going to be based on votes starting
5319840	5325520	July 4th you can vote on what titles you believe should be featured obviously a big problem
5325520	5329880	with Xbox Live marketplace in the indie game section is that it's really hard to get noticed
5329880	5334560	on there right now so this will be a way to get visibility for some of those games so
5334560	5339640	we'll see what happens there submissions if you think if you are an indie developer you
5339640	5343520	know an indie developer that might want to get in on this you can submit through June
5343520	5349600	24th so that's not very much more time so you might want to get on that moving on speaking
5349600	5353040	of Xbox one of the big things that was shown at the Microsoft press conference this year
5353040	5360200	was the fabled the journey demonstration well a very interesting quote from Peter Molyneux
5360200	5367440	this week about it this was in an interview with official Xbox magazine quote I made a
5367440	5373480	horrendous mistake on the press demo in taking out the navigation allowing players to move
5373480	5379640	I'll state on record now that fable the journey is definitely not on rails and there's this
5379640	5383560	whole thing where there's I guess he met with all these journalists and he made them sign
5383560	5392120	the board for it said it is not on rails and all this stuff so a horrendous mistake and
5392120	5396940	I have to agree they made a huge mistake not showing that you could navigate it did look
5396940	5404520	like rails so they should have said something about that but who knows we'll see more about
5404520	5409200	this when it gets a little closer to release by the way the reason why they did what they
5409200	5413920	did they wanted to showcase the game's action like using the magic attacks and the whole
5413920	5418640	horse and carriage and all that stuff because the unreal or the non on rails part wasn't
5418640	5423160	finished yet one of the other big pieces to come out of e3 was that you're gonna get a
5423160	5429280	free game if you have a 3ds you're gonna get the four swords the Legend of Zelda four swords
5429280	5433120	that is going to be coming out for free a little later this year it's supposed to be
5433120	5438160	out in September according to Nintendo well just to clarify it did come out this week
5438160	5442760	that the version you're going to be getting is the Game Boy Advance version because there's
5442760	5448040	no real way to do the GameCube emulation I'm assuming on the 3ds right now the Game Boy
5448040	5453000	Advance version is the version that you will be able to get on the 3ds no word yet about
5453000	5458320	if it's going to be enhanced at all kind of like excite bike had very minimal thrills
5458320	5461660	to kind of enhance it for widescreen and so forth no word if that's going to be given
5461660	5467320	the same treatment for Zelda for four swords or possibly even maybe online that might just
5467320	5470840	be wishful thinking I don't know but it is the Game Boy Advance version that you're gonna
5470840	5476720	get for free later this year and I guess free is not such a bad deal unless it's yours dark
5476720	5482160	soccer you have some rapid fire stuff for us I do for portal to there's some download
5482160	5487480	content coming out this is the six cents motion pack but it only works with the razor hydro
5487480	5492440	motion controller you can actually get the pack of course through steam you can get the
5492440	5497720	controller through steam as well as 140 bucks but it comes with a copy of portal 2 and a
5497720	5504600	download content of course if you already have portal 2 then you have a gift for a friend
5504600	5511020	then in other news there is the Super Mario Brothers 3 fan remake I think we've covered
5511020	5517200	it before but there's a 2 version 2.0 out that has much better improved graphics especially
5517200	5525360	in the background and 84 bonus rooms a new final castle and 30 different cameos so there's
5525360	5531760	a footage of it up on YouTube if you go find it it's Super Mario Brothers 3 version 2.0
5531760	5536320	and then I actually watched some of the video and it does look really nice by the way and
5536320	5544000	then Sony is offering six months of curiosity for ps3 owners basically you sign up for their
5544000	5553680	little demo of the service and you can get a music unlimited option and then you can
5553680	5559440	listen to whatever songs you want to pretty cool that's pretty cool as long as it doesn't
5559440	5565280	roll into like a subscription or something like that well that yeah I would decide but
5565280	5569280	I mean I know they were very careful about PlayStation Plus where they did go out of
5569280	5574080	their way to say you once the 30-day trial is up in the welcome back program once the
5574080	5578640	30-day trial is up you will not be charged at all I mean it's it's yeah I'm actually
5578640	5583920	I'm trying to get it I have to download my games and stuff but right now we don't have
5583920	5589000	remember my my ps3 doesn't have wireless internet keep in mind you only have till July something
5589000	5595080	I know that it's July 3rd I'm probably gonna do this week but uh you know I've been have
5595080	5602040	to drag an ethernet cable out to the front room is not very fun all right let's get to
5602040	5606220	the Twitter topics I've actually before I get there I've actually been purposely waiting
5606220	5610840	on the PlayStation Plus I'm waiting till right before the last day because if it is a 30-day
5610840	5615840	trial either something's got to come out real soon that makes me want to get it like now
5615840	5620360	to get the discount or whatever or I'm gonna wait and see you know cuz see if they maybe
5620360	5624080	start putting on some real good stuff after it's not free anymore you know I mean for
5624080	5628000	most people that went in and jumped in day one we'll see I don't know maybe it'll pay
5628000	5633120	off maybe not let's move into some Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr every week you
5633120	5637560	show us your tweets and we read them here on air why because we're the show where every
5637560	5642680	gamer has a voice JV Mon sent us a string of tweets to start us off today that basically
5642680	5646720	he went to Nintendo World and said there's a huge line for Zelda I didn't even realize
5646720	5650320	they were showing that today but they were of course this is New York City he says it
5650320	5655000	easily goes down at least a block and a half before they start letting people in and even
5655000	5659020	send a little picture I guess these are people like going into the store cuz from this picture
5659020	5663760	it doesn't look very long but the lines going like the other way but yeah looks like you're
5663760	5669480	huge crowds out there today and he says the one time I forgot the 3ds at home like everyone
5669480	5675680	has them you get a street pass like a hundred people over at that event crazy let's see
5675680	5681440	also some other tweets Warrior Bob had tweeted I just realized I've been listening to olr
5681440	5685880	for like seven years holy carb yeah some of our listeners have been listening a long time
5685880	5690000	so thank you to all you of course the listeners we wouldn't be here for more finger support
5690000	5693960	whether you just started listening this week or you've been there since episode one which
5693960	5697880	would be very few of you because I think we had 12 people listening that week but thank
5697880	5702400	you to you guys who supported us from whatever time over the years Defective Candy sent us
5702400	5711360	a tweet with a story from CNN average age of a gamer goes up and CNN had reported here
5711360	5716800	I guess they were reporting about this 37 year old that you know now that I'm gonna
5716800	5722600	be 33 pretty soon 37 does not seem that old at all in a row so I'm just kind of surprised
5722600	5727440	they're talking about this whole thing like gamers are getting older I think just a lot
5727440	5732360	of us grew up on games and haven't stopped because we just accepted as a part of our
5732360	5738280	lives whereas I think back when the original Nintendo came out maybe 37 year olds at the
5738280	5743720	time didn't get it quote unquote so I don't know but anyway they were talking about this
5743720	5748040	whole thing about how gamers are getting older blah blah blah blockbuster games the social
5748040	5753360	games and so on and so on yeah gamers are getting older because I think they just haven't
5753360	5760320	left stuck with them dark Tetsuya says that he is plugging his first round of where are
5760320	5764240	they now interviews I guess some of the people he's mentioned some of the people is going
5764240	5768520	to be interviewing Jessica Harper is going to be in one of the where are they now interviews
5768520	5774280	virtually who you might remember he was the guy that was famous for passing max 300 back
5774280	5779800	in the day and rice used to be in our chat room all the time remember that kid all the
5779800	5784060	time back when we were on life is five so dark Tetsuya has like dug out all these old
5784060	5787680	school people from the past is going to be running features on the site so especially
5787680	5791280	if you were into the money culture back in the day it sounds like he's found a lot of
5791280	5795080	those people if you're not so much into the money culture then it's interviews with gamers
5795080	5798200	but you'll be I think it'd be neat to see the roots of where we came from although if
5798200	5804320	you can't tell where Jessica Harper is you know we know where she is yeah Jessica Harper
5804320	5809000	of course is on Saturday nights on all games radio on her own show with Travis Donovan
5809000	5813640	why are you guys listening that's right so yeah I could tell you where she is now but
5813640	5818320	I'm sure there'll be some other little tidbits in there maybe she'll talk about how it was
5818320	5823160	to have DDR freak in orange launch radio kind of coexisting because it was an interesting
5823160	5826120	history we talked about it when she was here for the first time on the show if you didn't
5826120	5831400	listen you'll just have to go find that episode all right anyhow type classes a few tweets
5831400	5836600	one of them is about I don't think this comes up later in the show so I apologize if I'm
5836600	5842320	stealing someone's story the tiger claw posted but I guess this had to do something um what
5842320	5847160	was this electronic arts no we definitely don't have this on the list tonight electronic
5847160	5855040	arts had a gun in the godfather games called the Dillinger and back in 2009 the grandson
5855040	5861960	of Dillinger's half-sister threatened to sue EA unless they paid him millions of dollars
5861960	5867160	wow that's kind of sad well a judge in Indiana this week said that the Dillinger descendant
5867160	5872640	is not entitled to any money there is an Indiana law regarding a person's publicity right it
5872640	5878320	was enacted after Dillinger died so sorry totally sounds like a cash grab thing against
5878320	5886000	a big corporation and he got basically laughed out of court everybody point and laugh hahaha
5886000	5892520	tiger claw links us one more story Miyamoto has said that virtual boy games on the 3ds
5892520	5896920	it could happen I guess wherever there's money to be made right it was in an interview with
5896920	5902800	game spot saying quote for Miyamoto well that's not my exact plan but something like that
5902800	5908640	could happen I can say that in my photo album on my Nintendo 3ds there is a photo of a virtual
5908640	5915320	boy so that says I do have a virtual boy at my disposal laughs only 14 games were ever
5915320	5921440	released in the West virtual boy color yeah I think it would be interesting to see them
5921440	5926480	visit some of those games they weren't terrible per se I mean they would be good what are
5926480	5931560	they charging for those three bucks I think they'd be good three dollar games yeah you
5931560	5935720	know like the Mario game nice to see them redone in color I think red I think it would
5935720	5939720	be neat to see them redo that but we'll see and hopefully this time they won't give us
5939720	5945960	migraines but we'll see that was the worst we'll see that does it for the twitter topics
5945960	5952580	night twitter.com slash olr say hi to us throughout the week more news stories mailbag soon skype
5952580	5960040	line after that we still have plenty more to cover so let's go to Loki ah yes so apparently
5960040	5965480	you know the long talked about connect for windows software development kit has finally
5965480	5973320	been released released the beta has and of course they have you know the versions available
5973320	5978280	for 32-bit and 64-bit and requires windows 7 and I guess it's for non-commercial use
5978280	5986440	so right now you can you know homebrew developers can make their own connect hacks or whatever
5986440	5993040	and show them off and one way may be able to show them off is actually in this new vote
5993040	5999880	for the next connect hack to become a connect fun labs toy they have voting up right now
5999880	6009960	for a few different hacks six well-known ones I guess the apps in question keyboard anywhere
6009960	6015800	it's basically like the keyboard from big you know or the floor keyboard where you can
6015800	6021320	play just by stepping around the ground virtual conductor which would be kind of similar to
6021320	6028760	like we music the conductor in that connect body art would basically take pictures of
6028760	6033560	you as you're moving around and you can kind of layer yourself throughout there they have
6033560	6042600	a really weird kind of hippie video for that hand puppets was shown off they had like a
6042600	6046760	bird hand puppet has been projected onto the wall that someone is manipulating with their
6046760	6051920	arm and when the camera saw you move your hand it would move the puppet as well so it's
6051920	6058680	kind of cool digital pin art which is like those pin art devices where you can kind of
6058680	6063560	make your hand imprint stuff like that they have that and then music visualizer which
6063560	6067880	would be kind of just like it sounds something you play music to and it kind of makes these
6067880	6076520	waveforms appear all throughout your room so those are all right now you can vote on
6076520	6084120	those on connect share.com and have you played connect fun labs yet no it's so dopey like
6084120	6088400	it is it's really one of those things is fun for five minutes and you're like oh okay but
6088400	6092100	it's real yeah it's free can't complain free achievement points if you're into that sort
6092100	6097760	of thing but I it's really the type of thing I think a bunch of people would get drunk
6097760	6101600	and have a lot of fun making the little mini movies like you know the one I did at the
6101600	6106720	Sailor Moon that was like you know I'll kill you and all that stuff but I don't know a
6106720	6109880	lot of it's kind of okay I would be with a keyboard thing to come out though that look
6109880	6117120	it needs to be longer than 15 seconds yeah they need to let you do more with that alright
6117120	6121680	anyhow moving on to one of the other announcements out of E3 was that there is a Silent Hill
6121680	6128400	collection coming not just a Metal Gear but a game that's dear to us the Silent Hill series
6128400	6133440	is getting an HD collection but here's the catch it's only on PlayStation 3 it will only
6133440	6138760	include Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 but there will be new high definition graphics
6138760	6144600	so right now it's a PlayStation 3 exclusive according to the producer Tom Hewlett quote
6144600	6148960	it's always been a primarily Sony platform series so right now we're just aiming at a
6148960	6152600	Sony exclusive which isn't to say that in the future it won't be available anywhere
6152600	6158380	else but right now it's a Sony exclusive they are looking at a fall 2011 release by the
6158380	6163760	way there is all new voice acting in this game as well it is being directed by Mary
6163760	6170080	Elizabeth McGlynn and so there's a new actor that's going to be in the series let's see
6170080	6178400	and I think a lot of this is because the other actor James Sunderland doesn't have such kind
6178400	6182400	things to say about his participation I'm sorry the guy who played James Sunderland
6182400	6188600	guy see he quote Konami knows that they owe me residuals for all previous unauthorized
6188600	6193420	reuses of my mocap and virtual performances it would appear Konami is seeking to avoid
6193420	6198640	further liability by changing the voice of their latest reuse of the Silent Hill 2 materials
6198640	6203560	however if any of my mocap appears in the new release Konami will be liable for unauthorized
6203560	6209800	reuse of my performance yikes I'll get around to seeking compensation through the courts
6209800	6213520	one of these days I simply don't have the time for it right now I hope this doesn't
6213520	6218840	burn out any fans it's just business as usual on the production side of games yikes so it
6218840	6223760	sounds like we might have the real reason why all new voice acting is coming to the
6223760	6230600	game anyhow one other thing I want to put out you know there is the Silent Hill downpour
6230600	6235040	game coming out soon which I don't know I think the shark might have been jumped on
6235040	6241240	Silent Hill we might be kind of be done with it and if we weren't if this wasn't the nail
6241240	6247600	in the coffin the game's soundtrack of course no longer by Akira Moka it's by Dan Licht
6247600	6257440	who did the music for Dexter the theme song is being written by Korn the metal band yes
6257440	6263320	that's right Korn is doing the theme song to the game hey remember the 90s you guys
6263320	6267520	weren't they awesome you know though I have to listen to the actual song first because
6267520	6271840	you know just because it's done by Korn doesn't mean it's going to be terrible there's a very
6271840	6276840	good likelihood that it's going to be terrible but you know there's some artists out there
6276840	6282040	that can do scores that aren't they aren't terrible but then again this is Korn so it's
6282040	6285200	not scoring it they're just doing the theme song well it's also though if you want to
6285200	6289580	look at versatility I mean Daft Punk did do the entire Tron Legacy soundtrack and it was
6289580	6293400	quite different than their usual stuff true but when that was announced everybody said
6293400	6299720	that's fucking awesome and that makes sense but Korn doing Silent Hills is kind of like
6299720	6306200	do not want like the guy doing the guy that did Dexter the score for Dexter doing the
6306200	6309560	score for this game I don't think it's gonna be that bad I think that would be yeah I think
6309560	6314280	that'd be all right I mean the reality is Akira Moka is moved on he's doing something
6314280	6320240	else now you're not gonna have that yeah so he's doing something else that's for sure
6320240	6326320	and speaking of Neon Genesis even the music game yeah yeah I heard about that that's not
6326320	6333600	as big project though no no no it's just weird yeah so we'll see what happens with the Korn
6333600	6338760	theme song hey some of you still some of you still love your Korn so maybe it'll be a great
6338760	6342400	thing I just don't when I think of Silent Hill and what bands would go good with that
6342400	6348000	I don't think a Korn I don't know pendulum Alan Wake had a pretty badass soundtrack actually
6348000	6352480	but they used a lot of old songs there was a Poe song on there Poe hasn't put out an
6352480	6358200	album since 98 I love Poe dude whatever songs like it just I was playing Alan Wake and like
6358200	6362520	chapter 2 or chapter 3 closes with a Poe song like it came out of nowhere I was like which
6362520	6367620	one it's fucking Poe haunted oh I know it's like a great song I was like oh my god this
6367620	6372560	game has Poe this is great here's something random Alan Wake has probably been in development
6372560	6377680	since 98 but yeah here's something random is that almost every CD that I've burned except
6377680	6382860	for my very last one has trigger happy jack on it can't talk to a psycho like a normal
6382860	6389000	human being yeah that's a great fucking love Poe however she needs to just put out a new
6389000	6392600	album get over all this I was abused by my record label show me on the doll where the
6392600	6398720	record label touched you I mean just I'm kind of over all that anyway Loki we'll save that
6398720	6403760	for a different podcast that's hilarious well how how about some Nintendo news how about
6403760	6410900	some Nintendo news well Mario Kart 3d is supposedly gonna have eight player local wireless racing
6410900	6420780	if it goes to plan and eight player online as well so basically Hideki Kono said that
6420780	6426480	it would have online play and they just weren't sure what exactly the configuration was but
6426480	6433840	that the goal is that you could have eight players both in local wireless and over Wi-Fi
6433840	6437760	so they also said that should be able to handle 60 frames per second with eight players in
6437760	6446280	both online offline 2d and 3d it's pretty cool and then in addition to that is red flare
6446280	6455760	3ds Japan is gonna be getting a bright red one with a looks like it's black on the inside
6455760	6467640	top cover and they actually put out some press about that around the e3 time and that it
6467640	6474200	looks like it's gonna they're also with new we bundles there's gonna be on June 23rd we
6474200	6483480	sports resort and a we remote plus in the same color as console it should be about 250
6483480	6491280	bucks or 20,000 yen the red DS looks red 3ds excuse me looks kind of cool I gotta say it's
6491280	6495540	a pretty awesome color if they'd had that at launch I would have got that color think
6495540	6501300	of an old Famicom yep although it is weird to me how the top screen doesn't change colors
6501300	6506040	I mean I guess it's part of the whole 3d effect thing I think I read somewhere that they can't
6506040	6512520	change colors because it would harm the 3d effect but whatever what I can see that because
6512520	6518560	your frame colors are gonna affect your perception that's why I like for some reason like displaying
6518560	6524340	most art is good on a room with a light pink wall okay well I understand that you can't
6524340	6528840	change the frame around the actual you know system but I mean they can change at least
6528840	6533280	the outside could all be one cuz I seem to remember the lid is still I don't know I haven't
6533280	6538400	it's mine is black so it doesn't really matter it is they do have like three different colors
6538400	6543480	on there three different shades of a color and so I they can do it but yeah yeah I don't
6543480	6548880	know the black around the outsides I put a link to the image in the chat room all right
6548880	6552280	all right well let's move on with some more news yeah it's not it's not too terrible but
6552280	6558640	anyways um so other fun stuff here I'm gonna talk a little bit about Nintendo and the Wii
6558640	6564680	U again and of course one things that people are asking because it's somewhat popular to
6564680	6570920	have some free to play games on different platforms Nintendo is not interested in freemium
6570920	6578940	games and saying that it hurts the value of games it says that's because I myself am one
6578940	6583160	of the game developers who in the future wants to make efforts so that the value of software
6583160	6588260	would be appreciated by the consumers it says although freemium games can make money through
6588260	6594020	ads and microtransactions they expressing concern about destroying the value of the
6594020	6599200	game software once again I think it's all because they want to sell virtual console
6599200	6606480	games for $5 versus 99 cents that you can get for a great game on some other platforms
6606480	6611460	like Android and the iOS and stuff like that not to say that all 99 cent games that come
6611460	6614680	out on those are very good speaking of which I just want to throw out there there's a big
6614680	6620800	sale going on this weekend on for for games for 99 cents on iOS and it's the company game
6620800	6626480	loft which you know they're a little because they they kind of rip off games but they they
6626480	6629720	do a pretty decent job from what I understand of ripping off games so I just bought two
6629720	6633360	of them because all the games are 99 cents right now I bought order in chaos which is
6633360	6639520	their Wow clone on the phone and I hear it's it's definitely not Wow but for an iPhone
6639520	6644320	it is kind of impressive and then eternal legacy which try to guess what it's a clone
6644320	6648600	of just from the little icon I already know it's literally I'll show it to dark soccer
6648600	6651880	in the bottom right hand corner there on my phone I just I just downloaded it while I'm
6651880	6656680	here would who does that look like to you yeah who did tell listeners who's that look
6656680	6663700	like very cloud yeah it's it's a Final Fantasy 7 rip off but they're 99 cents so I and I
6663700	6667880	hear they're good rip off so we'll see I'll tell you about those next week but anyway
6667880	6673280	sorry to deviate from the story so what's that mean exactly cuz Ghost Recon online is
6673280	6679800	a free play to game on a PC and it's gonna be on the Wii U well expect it not to be free
6679800	6686560	to play so that's kind of unfortunate also it's very long you know it's very far away
6686560	6693600	so maybe they'll change their mind but I don't know it's just Nintendo be Nintendo whatever
6693600	6702080	and of course you know people were hoping that you know because the Zelda 25th anniversary
6702080	6706640	is happening right now that maybe Nintendo's gonna do something cool like they did with
6706640	6710960	you know well I wouldn't exactly call it cool because all they did was port a fucking Super
6710960	6715200	Nintendo game to the Wii but they're hoping that there would be some sort of Legend of
6715200	6718440	Zelda anthology or something like that that would come out with you know all the Zelda
6718440	6726720	games you know on a disc or something and of course they said no they're not gonna do
6726720	6733640	that because they don't want to do the same thing two years in a row that was their excuse
6733640	6741040	they don't want to do the same thing two years in a row ah Nintendo you just make it too
6741040	6744480	damn easy you don't want to do the same thing two years around like re-release all these
6744480	6753560	old-ass games and you know mark them as new or I don't know it wasn't like Mario Galaxy
6753560	6760160	Mario Galaxy to release not too far apart I mean you know that's within two years about
6760160	6764760	new Super Mario Brothers we and New Super Mario Brothers me yeah they don't want to
6764760	6768300	do they're getting these not a game no no here's what they want to do they want to release
6768300	6773080	all that shit on a virtual console or you know for the 3ds or something charge you you
6773080	6776960	know separately for everything in my opinion they kind of already did it back on the Game
6776960	6784520	Cube too yeah they did it on the Game Cube as a pre-order bonus come on if that was awesome
6784520	6788980	see that's how you treat your customers by offering them something really fucking awesome
6788980	6795280	for ordering Wind Waker which I still think is a pretty awesome game but they just don't
6795280	6800720	want to do that they don't want to do it so whatever and you know what they're gonna do
6800720	6807400	I will bet you money you see cuz that that wonderful Wii U doesn't play Game Cube games
6807400	6813680	so that means it's time to do some more of those so was it virtual console Game Boy Game
6813680	6819920	Cube games it's no more the new play motion games remember how they had that for a while
6819920	6824840	where they're gonna take old-ass Game Cube games yeah like Peekman straight port them
6824840	6830560	over with Wii controls mm-hmm yeah that's what they're gonna do good times hey as long
6830560	6835520	as f-zero is one of those games because I'm kind of pissed that I didn't hear about a
6835520	6842720	new f-zero but I guess it was just dreaming anyway all right moving on to another story
6842720	6847340	isn't f-zero 64 right yeah but that's already on virtual console that's been all you know
6847340	6853920	what they're gonna do their import that shit the 3ds oh my god moving on this was a kind
6853920	6857060	of interesting story from the weekend it's about Duke Nukem Forever and it has to do
6857060	6861880	with those negative reviews and so forth I don't know if you heard about what happened
6861880	6868560	but on Twitter this gentleman named James Redner he is the founder of the Redner group
6868560	6874920	who was representing 2k games and was representing some of the games like Duke Nukem Forever
6874920	6880640	and so forth he actually put a tweet out that said too many went far with their reviews
6880640	6885380	we are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's venom he
6885380	6890960	followed it with bad scores are fine venom-filled reviews that's completely different he did
6890960	6894760	follow up his I don't know he was probably high or drunk when he did it he deleted the
6894760	6899260	tweets and then apologized saying that he was just acting under emotions he was just
6899260	6902960	being very emotional and his panties were very bunched and he wrote those tweets in
6902960	6908800	anger but 2k games sacked him they said 2k games does not endorse the comments made by
6908800	6913680	Jim Redner and we can confirm that the render group no longer report represents our products
6913680	6918960	that was a very public bitch-slapping of that but you know this is one of those things that's
6918960	6922960	not a very big secret that seems to go on in the industry and it's this very interesting
6922960	6928100	game of chicken that goes on between the big media sites and these you know people that
6928100	6933080	represent the publishers is the publishers will send games out early but there's always
6933080	6937540	kind of that expectation of well are you gonna print a good review and we've heard these
6937540	6942000	stories about embargoes that are allowed to be lifted only if you give the game a good
6942000	6948400	review and you know you can get a sneak peek at this game if you gave such and such game
6948400	6952880	a good review I mean it's shady shit that happens and that's why we tell you you know
6952880	6958720	a lot of times the the reviews that you trust most come from the indie sites that are buying
6958720	6963680	these games themselves and not going through these PR agencies I'm not I'm not knocking
6963680	6968160	all PR agencies because some of them do really great things and they do really help out and
6968160	6973280	get questions answered and so forth but unfortunately there's a lot of shady shit that happens out
6973280	6978940	there and if you don't think this happens on a big website that you like to read a lot
6978940	6984400	between that website and the agency you're you're really lying to yourself you know this
6984400	6989880	this is just a part of the industry I remember very vividly we went to a particular company's
6989880	6996000	thing and had to sign things saying we would not report on anything until I think it was
6996000	7000640	like the Monday after or something like that sure enough the Sunday night before all the
7000640	7008000	big websites got to leak some stories it was kind of shady so each got one so what you
7008000	7012760	do in that kind of case is you just start you know you quote them as the source I know
7012760	7016200	it's you just quote them as the source but then it's like you know you're sending people
7016200	7021000	back to the big websites and not anybody's supposed to start necessarily like for example
7021000	7024880	there was a story I read this week that went back about three different websites and people
7024880	7028680	kept quoting the one that was quoting the other one that was quoting the other one so
7028680	7034980	you know you can do that all right let's get to the mailbag every week at orange launch
7034980	7040360	radio we welcome your emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com we're going to dive into
7040360	7045920	the email bag head first and read your emails dark soccer wants to set it out tonight because
7045920	7049100	she's going to be nursing her throat with some tea so she doesn't cough and die on air
7049100	7052120	so I'm going to read some emails tonight and we're going to start with a couple here from
7052120	7057000	holly d holly d and chat says are you guys going to make an orange lounge guild for rift
7057000	7063400	like you did with wow if so let us know the shard nothing official from my standpoint
7063400	7067400	I actually let my rift subscription lapse sorry it's just I didn't want to pay for multiple
7067400	7072320	games at once so I might go back to it later like if there's a really cool expansion or
7072320	7079960	something but I let it lapse so I don't know if there's enough rift people out there then
7079960	7084560	by all means we should start something but I don't know if we have a lot of olr listeners
7084560	7088400	playing rift we'll have to see ask on the forums that'd be a good place to check that
7088400	7095500	out orange launch radio.com holly sends us another email about sony and more hacks going
7095500	7100960	on so apparently being hacked once writes holly and taking the network down then again
7100960	7105600	then on a different website compromising millions of accounts it has happened again this time
7105600	7111520	it was not customer information but the entirety of the source code for the psn network how
7111520	7116280	sony never fixed the original vulnerability everyone waited for four weeks for psn to
7116280	7121080	come back for nothing that's not good that that leaked I'm not just sure if this level
7121080	7125800	of idiocy can be covered by the phrase monumental stupidity but I'm sure it's a start and we
7125800	7131520	get linked to a website uh she links us to a story from jupiter broadcasting.com which
7131520	7139760	I don't think I've ever heard of yeah let's see a hacker group got into hacking sony on
7139760	7145120	june 6th and they leaked the source court code to the sony psn developers network and
7145120	7149440	that could allow people to find more flaws with the sony system very quickly it could
7149440	7154560	also open up a private psn network they got all the source code and of course this was
7154560	7158760	all happening you know after sony was supposed to be fixed they were they used the hacker
7158760	7164320	group used a sql injection attack against sony pictures they got 150 000 records from
7164320	7174860	the database of more than 4.5 million records wow hackers gonna hack not that that makes
7174860	7179720	it right but uh again change of passwords use them um use different passwords on different
7179720	7188840	websites uh going to an email now from who's this from janai dear olr i found a horror
7188840	7194400	point-and-click game on the xbox live indie game section called decay i can describe it
7194400	7201200	as deja vu meets silent hill in an atmospheric way there are three episodes costing 240 microsoft
7201200	7205360	points each i think it is a highly polished game for an indie developer i would like to
7205360	7208760	hear your comments on this game and then he links us to the official site well i haven't
7208760	7213440	played the game yet but it looks like you can get more info at decay dot shining dash
7213440	7220080	gate dot se please note that is not a dot com it's dot se and uh yeah there's this whole
7220080	7224680	little trailer on the website for the game that is auto playing boo hiss i hate that
7224680	7227640	but apparently yeah it's this whole little point and click adventure game i haven't checked
7227640	7232880	it out i will have to take a look i like the idea of more point and click adventure games
7232880	7240320	on uh yeah it looks like there's part two part three part four is the final part that's
7240320	7250040	pretty cool i'll have to check that out oops why is twitter music playing audio fail moving
7250040	7257060	on to another email from joseo sumi ragawa greetings orange lounge radio i make music
7257060	7261160	videos using cutscenes from video games and i'm having trouble finding a download site
7261160	7265880	that uses the right kind of codec that works on windows movie maker it says that it's an
7265880	7270340	unregistered file hey loki you're good with movies right you should listen to this i make
7270340	7273600	movies using i'm sorry i make music videos using cutscenes for video games i'm having
7273600	7277160	trouble finding a download site that has the right kind of codec that works on windows
7277160	7281740	movie maker so if you three or the chat could help in directing me to that area i would
7281740	7287000	be grateful i'm looking for bayonetta cutscenes preferably how do you get cutscenes that you
7287000	7291640	can use in windows movie maker um i don't remember what exactly windows movie maker
7291640	7296700	uses i'm sure it's just windows media stuff i mean it's all about having the correct codex
7296700	7302360	on your system um on your pc so just download some of the community codec packs and stuff
7302360	7307680	like that and hopefully that'll work you can even dump youtubes to movie files right can't
7307680	7312520	you uh it's not the best quality you can if you have the right real player i use real
7312520	7318000	player to download them offline whoa real player still exists yeah actually a real player
7318000	7325240	has a download thing that'll convert it to mp4 or anything damn real players i used to
7325240	7330160	use to watch episodes of downloaded south park in like 98 or just like you know looking
7330160	7334140	for like some sort of universal file converters and stuff like that see if you can find anything
7334140	7340000	that it's meant for that because uh i've really i honestly don't use movie maker i use adobe
7340000	7344120	premiere so that usually doesn't have a problem opening anything here's some comments from
7344120	7347920	our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com scott pilgrim says there's your problem you
7347920	7353680	use windows movie maker but download the k-lite codec pack that should help uh frisbee says
7353680	7361280	get a linux distro and use kden live uh and sha100mat even uh backs it up saying download
7361280	7366680	something other than windows movie maker frisbee says or open shot uh it might that might be
7366680	7369480	tough because windows movie maker might be the program you're comfortable with but there
7369480	7373800	are other alternatives out there um basically the same i mean there's a little bit of a
7373800	7377160	learning curve but like for example premiere like when i first started using like what
7377160	7380720	the hell am i doing and then now i i kind of am a little bit more comfortable with it
7380720	7386120	now that i've used it for a while movie maker i tried using one time and i don't know it
7386120	7391320	it's a little too basic um we use adobe audition actually to produce the podcast and uh at
7391320	7394800	first it can look really overwhelming because there's all these features that you know for
7394800	7400280	a podcast you don't really need but all the you know sound uh the opening that you hear
7400280	7405200	was was kind of mixed together and audition you know so adobe products are pretty good
7405200	7409540	anyhow let's go on to the rest of the email here from jose osumu regala also i would like
7409540	7415040	to chime in with the new gimmicky systems announced at e3 both have really lame names
7415040	7420960	who who in their right minds came up with vita and weu shame on you sony nintendo we
7420960	7426120	saw this coming well thanks for reading my humble little you know vita i'm not too it's
7426120	7432400	a weird name but they also have the sony vio and you know that works i like the psv that
7432400	7436720	comes out of that i think that's might have been something they were going for but i only
7436720	7442060	had to do was like place psp2 why why is it it got to be something fancy like the vita
7442060	7445860	see i think that with that whole back thing they could have called it the the playstation
7445860	7453880	touch and then it could be the past think about it it'd be clever looking for group
7453880	7458720	buried and hold pst or the uh the p the playstation to reach around because you can reach around
7458720	7466280	the back that would have been awesome on the back uh weu is definitely one that's getting
7466280	7470320	a lot of like you know a lot of people have made the joke about i thought it was a university
7470320	7475680	for mario you know things like that but uh you know you gotta go well everybody everybody
7475680	7485920	made fun of we when it first came out so again let's see the games to back up the name although
7485920	7491560	it was a weird that weu does not give that control like i don't think of that controller
7491560	7496320	when i hear weu like i get what they were trying to go for is that well it wasn't really
7496320	7501600	about one person it was a part basically saying the we is a big party game system and we wanted
7501600	7504640	to make a system that wouldn't just be about party games that's that's kind of what i took
7504640	7513720	away from what reggie was saying but uh weu weird yeah weird weird all right uh moving
7513720	7521640	on with some other emails speaking of weu we have an email from rob who likes to email
7521640	7525980	us a lot and we like reading his emails i let the weu and subsequent chatter in the
7525980	7530680	back of my brain for a while and here's a few things that fell out number one weu like
7530680	7535680	michael patcher said is the dumbest name ever of course it is the most memorable memorable
7535680	7541480	name ever too it won't hurt the sales two weu is in danger by revealing its hand too
7541480	7547160	soon the ps vita could do the same thing for the ps3 if they want to steal the idea i'm
7547160	7551980	with you there rob above because the psp remember in 2006 they were showing the ridge racer
7551980	7557440	with rear view mirror uh also if the ipad had a working controller pad doc similar to
7557440	7562320	the weu tablet it could instantly steal the idea and look you can play your games anywhere
7562320	7566560	you want instead of being stuck at home the ipad 2 can already do that didn't i see a
7566560	7570200	story this week about some racing game that was being played through the apple tv unit
7570200	7574280	well they had that for a while where they're doing that and you could basically it was
7574280	7580280	real racing to hd and you can do that through the hdmi and uh use the tablet as like a map
7580280	7583760	and stuff so you can do that already and i mean that may be a way that they're going
7583760	7587660	to combat this stuff especially especially if they decide hey later on that we're going
7587660	7594320	to go ahead and you know put out apple tv that plays games then they're going to have
7594320	7599620	you know you're going to control stuff with your ipod or whatever and ipad and you may
7599620	7604880	have that similar type of stuff so i don't know and one more thing michael patcher thought
7604880	7610080	vita was the second worst name for a system i disagree since vita has meaning in and of
7610080	7614920	itself i need to give sony credit for it in fact his analysis of nintendo and sony indicate
7614920	7620520	a bias towards sony not backed up by history look ma i'm a video game analyst ra baba ps
7620520	7624160	i really hope the vita doesn't get the name of vita max i hope they start calling it vita
7624160	7628920	vita magic bedroom that's just me uh well i mean this patcher guy you could look at
7628920	7632940	him the same way we talked about reviewers earlier in the show i bet a lot of you guys
7632940	7636480	listen to us every week because you know we're the show where every gamer has a voice but
7636480	7639800	we're the three that you hear every week and you probably keep listening to us because
7639800	7644840	you kind of like what we have to say you know in our analysis i mean we we joke about it
7644840	7649400	on the show sometimes that we're also video game analyst or as i say video game analysts
7649400	7653320	but uh it's it's sort of true i think you guys tuned into the show because you like
7653320	7658560	our perspective on things and you know i don't know this guy i don't know this michael patcher
7658560	7662960	guy so i'm not trying to say this disrespectfully but what the fuck makes him so goddamn special
7662960	7667600	like you know i see his name everywhere and on these websites and stuff but he's just
7667600	7675920	some asshole spouting off predictions just like me i guess he has a degree or something
7675920	7685960	he works for uh web rush morgan i believe whatever you know what the guy does anyone
7685960	7690280	like call him out for all the stuff that he's wrong on no no everyone forgets and every
7690280	7694520	everyone reports about what he says it's just like when they were reporting about voldemort
7694520	7699360	talking about you know this and that and stuff and everyone reports on it because that's
7699360	7703480	what they do they're always saying something let's let's talk about it you know he he's
7703480	7707600	saying this he must have some insider information no he doesn't he's a guy guessing on stuff
7707600	7711220	i said he gets paid a lot more than he has a different background and again i'm not trying
7711220	7715480	to sound disrespectful like i mean i realize this comes off completely rude but i mean
7715480	7724120	my the reality is i care no more or no less about his opinion than i do rob of us opinion
7724120	7729080	they're equal to me they're both gamers you know what i mean and actually i like rob about
7729080	7732880	just a slightly more he actually listens to this show michael hatcher is not a gamer he
7732880	7738800	he doesn't know shit about games rob is great uh going to our chat room and chat dot orange
7738800	7743000	on twitter.com oh here comes ego boost you ready break man says we listen to you every
7743000	7747320	week because one week we expect dark soccer to announce her plans for world domination
7747320	7753800	and she needs followers right dude that was in like episode four besides that why would
7753800	7758360	i announce my plans for world domination her plan for world domination is give me a dollar
7758360	7765120	or a taco no why would i announce it because when it's going to be uh mysterious and who
7765120	7769320	knows i might have already taken over the world it's just that i don't want the response
7769320	7775080	we are this we already are the official video game podcast of the galaxy we are we we talked
7775080	7778720	about this a long time ago is that we've declared that we are the official video game podcast
7778720	7784240	of the galaxy and that's that dibs patent pending but actually i do have to say that
7784240	7790760	you know dominating the entire world think about all of the paperwork and all of the
7790760	7796560	stuff you'd have to manage i just like i'll let the world fuck itself up oh yeah we did
7796560	7804960	give bobby pluto we did give that bobby can have all of the dwarf planets series pluto
7804960	7811600	and it's oddly shaped moons all right moving on one other email last email tonight from
7811600	7817620	spazzinator who your space bar is broken or something like you have words running together
7817620	7822360	here you type like i was just typed on a psp i don't know but anyway i'm gonna do my best
7822360	7827600	to get through this email hey olr instead of the usual topics that i typically bring
7827600	7831520	up via email and twitter topics i thought i'd give my impressions of a recent downloadable
7831520	7837000	game release magic the gathering duels of the planeswalkers 2012 aka magic 2012 i forgot
7837000	7841120	that came out this week but it's only 2011 all right so fine magic 2012 is coming out
7841120	7844880	now these are the i i really like these kind of emails i want to hear reviews especially
7844880	7849280	on games i haven't played but i have a slight interest in i like the last magic game so
7849280	7854760	let's see for those out there that are unfamiliar with the magic games this is the second in
7854760	7859120	the series which is the video game adaptation of magic the gathering card game those who
7859120	7862800	have played the card game at one point or another will have practically no problem picking
7862800	7867000	up this game while newbies might have a marginally more difficult time with it due to the learning
7867000	7871360	curve but even then it's not too bad all in all it's a faithful recreation of the game
7871360	7874840	those who have picked up the original game last year really should pick up this one as
7874840	7879560	well there are no noticeable bugs at least on the psn version and from what i can tell
7879560	7883660	the devs have taken user input to heart and implemented much needed improvements while
7883660	7887740	it's not perfect it's a drastic improvement over the first assuming that you haven't picked
7887740	7893420	up the original game yet you want to pick up a cheap game i suggest passing passing
7893420	7898440	up i'm sorry i suggest passing over the original game and just going for magic 2012 frankly
7898440	7902560	i find this to be pretty damn fun in a major time scene rivaling the elder scrolls and
7902560	7906400	fallout series in terms of amount of time that will inevitably be spent in this game
7906400	7909780	while the single player stuff is fun and will be played a lot initially for the purposes
7909780	7913700	of unlocking stuff the real meat and potatoes of the game is the multiplayer which frankly
7913700	7918060	is a blast additionally if you're a trophy or achievement whore the 20 achievements or
7918060	7922180	trophies in the game are easy as hell to get even by my standards even my grandmother can
7922180	7928280	get them easily and she's been dead for 14 years wow that was morbid all in all i can't
7928280	7932760	recommend this game enough it is available for both xbox live arcade for 800 microsoft
7932760	7938680	points and on psn at its regular price for non ps plus members for 999 however due to
7938680	7942840	most people having a minimum of one month's worth of ps plus you can get the game at a
7942840	7948600	discount 799 so i give the psn version an ever so slight edge if only for that reason
7948600	7952920	dude and you're totally a sony fanboy don't even try tonight no but it's pricing is a
7952920	7956600	good point uh thanks for reading this email and sorry to dark sakura for sending this
7956600	7960760	wall of text i just wanted to be thorough with my review you should be so thankful she's
7960760	7966360	not reading emails this week because the whole space thing she would have screamed use your
7966360	7974080	space space space i'm the best of space space we were doing that on space mountain he was
7974080	7979160	he liked magic so much that the space bar got stuck we were doing that on space mountain
7979160	7986160	remember i do i remember that i'm the best of space so much space gotta see it all and
7986160	7992220	then we did it on star tours yes which by the way is an awesome ride is it a lot better
7992220	7997840	now that they've fixed it uh you know the old one was charming but it is definitely
7997840	8003320	modern now it's a lot smoother and it's just what i love about the ride is it just starts
8003320	8007280	right off with a bang like you know and you are on your way to whatever planet you go
8007280	8014420	to for the record we looked at how many different scenes and um at least with me and dan we've
8014420	8018960	got all the beginnings there were two different beginnings right we've got all but one of
8018960	8022960	the second one we didn't get hoth and i've been to hoth so it's cool it's the it's the
8022960	8028560	best one we got all three of the middle scenes the the third ones which is either yoda akbar
8028560	8034000	or leia it's a trap i know we're going to strip and then we got all but the last um
8034000	8039080	all but coruscant course for the last one naboos i i would say the riding the ride several
8039080	8043920	i've gotten i've seen all the last planets and i've seen all the i've seen every planet
8043920	8048740	now and i will tell you the best ones are hoth for the first and uh nabu believe it
8048740	8052080	or not the jar jar binks planet is the best because it has the best ending oh it was great
8052080	8055400	well i did like the the um the death star one the death star one was pretty rad that's
8055400	8059120	a close second of course con's not of of what we got though my favorite was kasheek because
8059120	8066680	i like wookies anyhow we'll stop nerding about star tours now and get to the fus of the week
8066680	8070040	it's the part of the show where we rant why because we can
8070040	8091920	f you to being sick it's it's not like it's a contagious disease it's all my sinuses and
8091920	8098000	it happens around this time of year i wanted to go swimming today as a result i laid down
8098000	8103760	for what i intended to be an hour nap at 10 30 i woke up at 3 30 having slept through
8103760	8110560	my alarm seven times apparently i kept resetting it in my sleep so yeah uh if you did the fact
8110560	8115480	that i felt kind of like sickly lately like my my side was hurting and the doctor couldn't
8115480	8118080	figure out what it is but at least it wasn't the same thing that put me in the hospital
8118080	8124080	in 08 so whatever and i had this weird head thing like i bruised my head or something
8124080	8128440	it fucking hurt like all week so if you did that and uh if you did the fact that my landlord
8128440	8133760	says we owe them seven dollars like what where did that come from apparently it was something
8133760	8140200	they just decided to throw on there a retro charge for something from april yeah what
8140200	8147920	f you lucky uh f you to uh fighting with my console and try to get it to work on my computer
8147920	8152960	right now took me a while because it was set the 1080i it really needed to be 480p and
8152960	8158360	i even did the thing to reset the uh graphics you know the quick little hold y and the right
8158360	8167120	trigger and restart your console but uh it just didn't want to work i got the work now
8167120	8172140	all right going to chat.org some follow-ups to some things from the email bag xenocore

8201640	8207800	for you guys and then the skype line 1877 game olr we'll get to that in just a moment
8207800	8213160	uh moving on though first couple more stories loki and of course you know one story that's
8213160	8218320	been around ever since duke nukem forever was being announced that's coming out and
8218320	8224440	so on and so forth there was a guy with a really old gamestop pre-order for duke nukem
8224440	8233280	forever from back in 2001 and apparently the guy actually did get to redeem his pre-order
8233280	8240480	for duke nukem forever and um along with that uh gearbox even sent him a bunch of cool swag
8240480	8246280	and uh stuff like that so uh apparently he does like the game the guy that picked up
8246280	8255120	the game so good for him glad that they you know took your receipt that you kept all this
8255120	8260780	time all right one more new story for you guys and then we're going to open up that
8260780	8267320	skype line 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and unfortunately
8267320	8272280	and on a bit of a sad note tonight it's another game studio who apparently has closed their
8272280	8278900	doors uh game republic is the studio apparently the website has disappeared it's no longer
8278900	8286600	online the tokyo offices now vacated uh apparently the founder yoshiki okamoto huge amounts
8286600	8290760	of debt and can't be tracked down so unfortunately it looks like they've closed some of the game
8290760	8296120	that they made majin and the forsaken kingdom uh folklore was another game that they made
8296120	8301440	and i believe they were the studio behind uh genji day of the blade if i'm not mistaking
8301440	8307940	uh the studio that's right of course infamous for the giant enemy crabs and while a lot
8307940	8311140	of people are pointing and laughing at that whole thing it's never any fun to report developers
8311140	8316920	losing their jobs it's a shitty economy right now no matter where you live all right let's
8316920	8322040	open up the skype line it's open now 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge
8322040	8327640	radio uh while we wait for those calls to come in i'm gonna ask loki if he has any last
8327640	8334720	minute stories um not really i mean there's not a whole lot else that we have the report
8334720	8338960	on i was gonna talk really quick though about uh there are some indie games that they're
8338960	8347080	showing off um and one of them uh was was it revolver 360 it's this game that's on the
8347080	8352960	xbox indie games and um it's pretty awesome i mean it just kind of goes to show you that
8352960	8357440	there's like hidden gems out there it's basically a kind of almost like a cave style shooter
8357440	8362480	it's just uh bullet hell like crazy but what makes it unique is that you can rotate around
8362480	8369980	in kind of this 3d um this like 3d sphere so you can rotate the environment around so
8369980	8374560	like if for example you have a you know bullets coming at you in a big line you can actually
8374560	8380160	rotate it so that they're um you know vertical to the screen so you can dodge past everything
8380160	8386120	uh kind of think of it like looking at tempest but kind of you know on the side let me go
8386120	8389800	to the phones we got a call coming in here hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
8389800	8394120	what up guys zenacore from the okc how y'all doing hey zenacore how you doing buddy you
8394120	8400920	know just hanging out ducking the man you know good time so are we uh so uh what's what's
8400920	8407240	on your mind i'm still pissed off about my yard's revenge purchase oh gosh i heard this
8407240	8414340	game was not so great but what what what happened to you well it the idea behind the game was
8414340	8419520	solid i mean it's just a cord yeah a old school corridor shooter like you know like lucky
8419520	8423200	and wild or anything else like that from the arcade at least that's the way it felt to
8423200	8429320	me when i was playing it but just certain rudimentary things that were going on slipped
8429320	8433040	through the cracks just like if it really got rushed i think is what happened to it
8433040	8438960	i hate that i hate that when games are so obviously rushed i mean the game is functional
8438960	8443080	but it looks like i mean the coders didn't finish putting the polish on everything when
8443080	8446800	you first started at least on the pc version what i'm playing it's not full screen you
8446800	8452440	can see the windows border yeah so i mean most savvy user you hit alt enter it will
8452440	8456680	go into windows mode but because of the age of my machine i can't put it in the direct
8456680	8462680	x10 so i'm not sure if i'm looking at the right graphics uh and the game play is a bit
8462680	8466840	rough it's just not polished i think it really got rushed which kind of disappoints me because
8466840	8470200	i sort of like the new idea they're going with it how do you feel about all these like
8470200	8475440	kind of uh reimagining i guess of classic games this is something atari has really done
8475440	8478520	a lot of and is going to continue to do over the next year i mean i think they've got a
8478520	8484460	centipede game coming out on 3ds uh warlords they've revisited i mean they're really trying
8484460	8490080	to bank on nostalgia redone i guess what do you think about that i bought into that initially
8490080	8494520	when they're doing that with the uh the xbox live arcade i got a lot of those games but
8494520	8498980	you know sadly all the multiplayer stuff hardly anybody plays them even when they first came
8498980	8503560	out plays a multiplayer which kind of disappointed me i was really looking forward to do like
8503560	8508800	tron deadly disc multiplayer and it's not happening so that was kind of upsetting but
8508800	8513680	as long as they add enough to the game to where if they're charging 10 bucks it feels
8513680	8518080	justified to me then it's fine they got to really polish it up or like what they did
8518080	8523160	with yards events they changed the whole dynamic and used it as a as inspiration for their
8523160	8527260	game i'm cool with that but just make sure you finish it you know give me finished stuff
8527260	8530880	that's all i want yeah it's kind of tough when you you know yards revenge was really
8530880	8535480	easily one of the top three atari 2600 games they ever released and just to kind of like
8535480	8543280	take a classic and just rush it oh that hurts it's not even that the game was badly designed
8543280	8547680	it's like the interface it's like normally when you're doing typesetting or whatever
8547680	8551520	you leave the text online or up on the screen long enough to where you can read it twice
8551520	8555640	it's bare if you're a speed reader you might just catch everything and be able to understand
8555640	8561920	what you're at it's it's that quick on screen even during during the game there's no speech
8561920	8565640	everything is in a chat bubble over on the corner you're not looking there in a hall
8565640	8569240	so you have no idea what the characters are saying to each other i'm barely i barely understood
8569240	8573880	what was going on but that's thanks for me reading lots of uh fan subbed anime and stuff
8573880	8579080	i'm used to looking at subtitles so i managed to catch everything uh what are the games
8579080	8583560	you've been playing lately anything else you want to throw out there uh not really doing
8583560	8589240	a lot of really anime watching and uh you know the overseas stuff the x-men stuff and
8589240	8593720	uh the the green lantern release that just came out recently the animated version oh
8593720	8596560	mainly keeping up with that speaking of green lantern did you hear the news today the new
8596560	8601680	movie uh it made 53 million which to me sounds like a lot of money but apparently considering
8601680	8607120	the budget and uh the marketing apparently they are calling that the very very low end
8607120	8613640	of expectations that uh doesn't bode well for a sequel later on yeah i think they're
8613640	8618640	initially predicting they'd get around 70 75 so i'm thinking that number is right around
8618640	8623460	where thor was well it did it i funny enough the story i'd read referenced the thor opening
8623460	8628820	and it did open below thor and when you consider that i i guess they said i which i found weird
8628820	8632800	the green lantern was more well known than thor and that was that was again the the source
8632800	8637100	that i read whatever but you could say that the actor in thor was an unknown whereas ryan
8637100	8641040	reynolds people know him so that was kind of an ouch yeah i think it's because everybody
8641040	8646440	knew he'd be better as a rile rainer or excuse me i get my lantern scared is screwed up here
8646440	8650520	but uh he's playing the wrong lantern in other words that we knew it so that's the problem
8650520	8655000	more more proof that deadpool should have come out already because you know he'd be
8655000	8660040	perfect for deadpool oh yeah we knew that yeah so that's given all right well we geeks
8660040	8663520	know all right i'm gonna let you go see of course we can take more calls but thanks for
8663520	8668080	the uh review on yours revenge uh no problem man take it easy take care one eight seven
8668080	8672400	seven game olr a username on skype is orange on radio i like this tonight it's like we're
8672400	8676040	getting reviews from everybody on games i haven't been able to touch this is pretty
8676040	8680920	nice so uh let's see if we get another one one eight seven seven game olr or a username
8680920	8684800	on skype is orange lounge radio let me ask you this dark sakura um while we're waiting
8684800	8688520	for some calls and loki left the room for a minute you know we're talking about nostalgia
8688520	8694120	on that last call in a game like yards revenge they've reimagined how do you you you really
8694120	8698400	still kind of live in the nostalgia world a little bit like you really probably play
8698400	8702720	more retro games than you do current games i mean that's that's not hidden by your gaming
8702720	8711600	weeks and so forth how do you feel about a lot of these reimaginings i really um it's
8711600	8716040	kind of weird for me because if they're done faithfully then i have no problem with it
8716040	8722520	if they take the basic concept and evolve it i'm really excited by that but if it's
8722520	8731120	just you know and my concept of butchering a game is pretty personal it's going to be
8731120	8736160	different for everybody but if they just take it and completely ruin aspects of it that
8736160	8740720	i thought were great then then no like if they took the guardian legend and filled it
8740720	8745620	full of blood no no all right let's go to the phones because we got more calls coming
8745620	8751600	in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh this is takey q takey q what's on
8751600	8757560	your mind buddy um this is more of like a loki question okay any tips on upgrading a
8757560	8763560	ps3 slims hard drive oh did you hear that any tips on upgrading a ps3 slims hard drive
8763560	8769120	just make sure you back up everything uh to something else first and then um it's pretty
8769120	8774480	easy i mean you just pop it in there and then format it um you do have to make sure it's
8774480	8782760	formatted fat32 i think though uh are there any online resources just search online there's
8782760	8789960	like uh there's a a thing from hp that you can format anything fat32 like i did my external
8789960	8794640	laptop you don't need that all you have to do is run it through dos yeah uh what do you
8794640	8799560	expand in the hard drive in your ps3 for you trying to fit more porn no just like i feel
8799560	8804760	like i'm running out of space on my 120 that came with it you know i have an 80 gig and
8804760	8808520	i feel like i'm starting to run out of space too and a lot of it is because now thanks
8808520	8814840	to the free games i'm installing these like five six gigabyte games on the drive and yeah
8814840	8818720	i'm kind of i'm kind of with you i'm ready to expand my drive too do you download a lot
8818720	8822840	of movies on playstation marketplace or is it all like game um well i'm mostly using
8822840	8828240	voodoo now for the streaming since i don't like downloading from the psn store because
8828240	8832600	it takes a while why do you uh like voodoo as compared to hulu and netflix i don't usually
8832600	8838080	hear that one but i'm curious it's more for like the new releases it's like walmart for
8838080	8843880	new releases so sometimes they have like a sale for like 99 cents for like a more recent
8843880	8849240	movie i can watch that netflix doesn't have right all right very cool and like the new
8849240	8853920	releases you can just stream it instead of downloading it you know download takes like
8853920	8859560	maybe two hours three hours or streaming you just it's there will i be able to watch this
8859560	8865120	game of thrones that everybody's talking about on there i got a torn that that that that
8865120	8869120	shows on sunday nights and so of course i've never seen it you know it's funny having done
8869120	8873280	this show for nine years like any tv show that's on sunday nights i just i don't ever
8873280	8877140	get to watch like it's pretty good though i can't be good yeah i hear that one's really
8877140	8880440	good and i can't tell you how many people over the years have said rob you would love
8880440	8884820	desperate housewives because i like that campy type of stuff and i guess that shows very
8884820	8889200	campy but never seen an episode sunday nights i'm like if it's on sunday nights i've never
8889200	8895880	watched it and i have another thing another question too sure um do you have to like download
8895880	8900000	the firmware update for the when you're upgrading the hard drive like i've read like articles
8900000	8904280	on it that you have to uh loki left the room for a minute so i'm not sure because i haven't
8904280	8911480	changed my loki firmware update do you have to do a firmware update when you change those
8911480	8921760	drives um i think you may have to redo the one your current firmware update to uh change
8921760	8926800	them over it says that you have to do it again and it's supposed to not work afterwards but
8926800	8932880	i put it i went from my 20 to my 500 maybe i didn't go back to my 20 i thought about
8932880	8936560	going back to my 20 but i never did can you use a usb drive with those this might be a
8936560	8942120	dumb question but you can but you can't store games to it oh interesting do you do movies
8942120	8948720	you put movies on there you can put like pictures music nice but you have to have certain directories
8948720	8953080	and stuff all right all right well uh any other thoughts for tonight before i let you
8953080	8961440	go um bye-bye socom why you say bye-bye socom didn't like the game i rented it and didn't
8961440	8966620	like the controls that you can't change it oh i hate that customizability should be like
8966620	8972280	one of the first easy things to think about out here so i'm i'm very uh i guess call of
8972280	8977180	duty player where you get you gotta have the triggers to fire and sight iron sight see
8977180	8984040	so and it's we're doing it on the rnl buttons instead of the triggers all right well we're
8984040	8987000	gonna let you go and we get some more calls but thanks for your call and good luck with
8987000	8992120	the ps3 upgrade all right thank you all right later 1877 game olr or a username on skype
8992120	8997660	is orange launch radio we can probably fit one more call in tonight so uh we'll see if
8997660	9004980	we get any other calls we're out of last minute stories right so we'll just uh we'll see if
9004980	9009000	anybody calls oh there it is lighting up there's always that little delay between uh when we
9009000	9012400	say something when it goes out over the air hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
9012400	9017000	it's the one and only ronma of course i knew you i knew you'd get through eventually ever
9017000	9020720	since you said in chat that i missed your twitter topic sorry about that it's okay i
9020720	9024800	forgive you i wasn't reading chronologically this week because we got a few that i wanted
9024800	9031420	to make sure i mentioned before today so that's why i screwed up but anyway fair enough what's
9031420	9039880	on your mind duke nukem forever ah what about it it's a guilty pleasure game to me the game
9039880	9045120	is so bad it's just good so it's like the showgirls of video games something along those
9045120	9052560	lines yes what uh tell us about how this game is so bad it's good like give give an example
9052560	9055480	of something in the game that happens where you're like oh my god this is terrible and
9055480	9063040	i love it for example um if you remember from the demo there are two twins in the game they're
9063040	9073760	called the wholesome twins mary and kate so no secret what that's parodying huh yeah pretty
9073760	9079360	much and they show a video clip of them doing a video to a song called full house oh it's
9079360	9085680	terrible very terrible i heard something about they die horribly later on like spoilers omg
9085680	9090120	but i i don't know i'm at the point where the aliens kidnap them and dukes all pissed
9090120	9095220	the fuck off about it i i hear it's not a pretty ending like it actually has some people
9095220	9100280	kind of saying that that's where that is exactly where the game crosses the line just so you
9100280	9106560	know i won't ruin it for you but you don't kill the hot chicks you don't do that i hear
9106560	9112660	the ending is like wow but we'll see uh so what do you think about these websites that
9112660	9118840	are giving the game a zero i think the sites are giving the game a zero are coming from
9118840	9125940	people who did not grow up playing the original duke nukem 3d it sounds like these are people
9125940	9131200	that are younger than me who don't know that ass from a hole in the wall also they're counting
9131200	9136960	on the fact that gearbox is working on so they expected something big like borderlands
9136960	9141540	as i said before all gearbox said that they were going to do was put the game out they
9141540	9147900	never said what they're going to exactly and so the weight of 12 plus years is like okay
9147900	9152480	let's see what you got it seems like they were just looking for a reason to just blast
9152480	9156020	a game here comes dan the man wants to say something on this topic yeah it should be
9156020	9161580	on just make sure oh god geez it makes everybody wonder why they weren't putting it out oh
9161580	9166080	because it sucked nuts and they knew it they were like holy fucking god we can't fix it
9166080	9175680	it's terrible and there you go that's what you all fucking get oh my god fucking even
9175680	9181660	gearbox couldn't polish that turd and gearbox rules great duke nukem's over fucking finish
9181660	9185500	the next brothers in arms or whatever the fuck you're doing and get to work on borderlands
9185500	9191500	too but rama says rama's review of the game is that this game is so bad it's good i hope
9191500	9197400	to find out when i'm done with the game i will ship it overnight to you so you can play
9197400	9202860	you don't have to i'm getting a copy well there you go uh sg100 matt in the chat room
