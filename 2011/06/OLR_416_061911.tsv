14241	24320	Tonight, June 19, 2011, more details emerge on the Wii U, a Facebook game developer sues an alleged copycat, and a Kinect software development kit for Windows is released.
31533	38675	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39015	39855	My name is Rob Roberts.
39875	44837	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
45057	45377	Hi.
45637	46137	How are you?
46697	47297	I'm unwell.
47658	48678	I'm sorry to hear that.
48938	49498	What's wrong?
49938	50618	Sinuses.
51359	51519	Oh.
51779	52379	You're Manuel?
53303	54264	I'm unwell.
54684	57126	Everybody say hello to DarkSakura, also known as Manuel.
59128	61890	And the smartass over there in the corner, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
62270	62690	Hello.
62830	63451	How are you doing, Loki?
63991	65212	I'm doing fine.
65252	70196	I'm eating the large, unhealthy sandwich, as is tradition.
70937	72778	And what is this unhealthy sandwich that you're eating?
73044	78107	It's a grinder from our very, very discounted food chain Winco.
78707	82869	But it's basically an Italian sandwich on a loaf of garlic bread.
83509	84190	It's so good.
84350	85230	And it's called a grinder?
85250	86131	It's called a grinder.
88732	107160	All right, anyhow, if you want to join us, the ever-present fourth guest on our show is the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us in our chat room and say hello because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
108261	111802	Loki is holding his sandwich up in the air like it's a victory pose.
111862	115104	Like he's He-Man or something.
115244	116604	Or the little Zelda noise.
117565	117845	Anyhow.
118519	121842	Alright, so Loki, you didn't get to join us for the second E3 show.
122042	123704	Obviously, that was the last thing that was on the feed.
123944	128929	And we were off on Sunday because we had done the other E3 shows Tuesday and Wednesday.
129309	137096	You were here Wednesday when we talked about things like Skyrim and I believe that was the day that Miklatov had waited in line to play the Vita and so forth.
137677	141841	Any kind of closing thoughts from you for E3 since you didn't get your chance before, Loki?
142982	143102	Um...
147060	160483	Saints Row is awesome I mean I don't know like the Playstation Vita I don't really care for I mean there's a lot of features to it which is kind of cool but
162734	164756	I just don't know if I really care about it too much.
164796	168198	I mean, there's not any games that jump out and say, oh my god, I gotta own that.
168338	170160	Like, you know, Uncharted.
170560	172241	See, I'm not a fan of the Uncharted series.
172862	175864	Not that it's a bad series, but I just, I never played them.
176164	176324	Right.
176765	178626	And don't really want to play them.
178646	180007	There's not enough time to play everything.
180127	180548	Exactly.
180568	182009	This isn't our day job, so.
182349	183170	It's alright.
183210	184531	I mean, it looks good.
185792	191136	I was unaware, now I don't remember the whole entire feature list, but I guess those things have GPS built into them.
192072	194416	I seem to remember that from the original unveiling.
194776	198862	I just saw that because I'm setting up the items for it and they've got some games.
200023	200704	It breaks it down.
200724	205871	You know how in the back of those PlayStation boxes it's like, okay, you need such and such space for storage.
205951	206632	It's one player.
206712	207353	It's online.
207393	208034	It's blah, blah, blah.
208755	212940	Well, they actually break it down to what features of the Vita are actually used.
213020	220729	Like, this uses the front touch, this uses the back touch, the tilt controls, the multi-touch on things, sliding your finger back.
220769	224473	So on a 1 to 10 on the gimmick meter, this game rates a 6 or a 7.
226255	228797	Yeah, I'm sure... Especially those launch games will make heavy use of gimmicks.
228817	236141	I'm sure there's going to be a lot of gimmicky stuff on there, but I think it's got potential as far as, you know, it's nice that that stuff is on there.
236161	241604	It's just, please, publishers, don't try to, you know, just make a bunch of gimmicky shit out of it.
241624	242204	Use it if it makes sense.
242485	242905	Exactly.
242965	250730	I mean, don't necessarily have to use the touchscreen for stuff you don't, you know, need to use it for.
250770	252711	I mean, buttons work just as well.
252771	253071	I don't know.
253322	260467	Let me go to this comment from chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where, by the way, there's a lot of praise going on for your sandwich that sounds really good.
260527	261328	It is really good.
261748	262809	You get a picture of that.
262849	264170	That just looks like... That's a half.
264290	267072	That looks like a heart attack that you're eating.
267212	268233	That's half a sandwich.
268573	269134	All right, anyhow.
270114	284279	So, going to chat room, BlackWolf starts us off tonight, and this is a quote I've heard him say several times, in fact, on his own show, and I don't remember if he said it on our E3 or whatever, but BlackWolf starts us off tonight saying, Saints Row is the video game version of what goes on in Loki's head.
284799	285320	Exactly.
286960	287540	Pretty much.
288301	290902	Saints Row is basically... Because, you know...
292222	298286	Grand Theft Auto 4 really was kind of a step away from the direction of Grand Theft Auto was kind of going.
298647	301188	San Andreas was just a really crazy game.
301228	302649	I mean, you could do so much in there.
302669	303670	You could do pretty much anything.
304050	305171	I mean, you had girlfriends you could date.
305191	306312	You could go ride a bicycle.
306352	314518	You can do base jumping, swim in the ocean, fly jets, just wander around the desert, go gamble, whatever.
315038	317480	And then Rockstar's like, hey, you know what?
318441	319823	We're gonna make the game more realistic.
319923	324392	So we're taking out all the fun stuff, like the tanks, the flamethrowers, the miniguns.
324592	325454	We're taking that all out.
325474	327137	We're just gonna make this game more realistic.
327177	330844	And everyone was kinda like, eh, okay.
331764	337649	And then, like, as stuff, their expansions came out, you know, they started kind of bringing that over-the-top stuff back.
337669	340591	But it's still nothing to what San Andreas was.
340712	345836	Whereas Saints Row was kind of crazy at the beginning, and then the second game was even crazier.
345856	357786	The third game was just, they basically, the developer was even, you know, quoted saying, before, you know, Saints Row, the, you know, activities and stuff were kind of over-the-top.
358286	360649	and Saints Row the Third were making everything over the top.
360889	368758	Every single situation that you're in, every single battle that you're fighting, the story, everything is going to be ridiculous, just over the top.
368778	371441	You're going to be telling yourself, I can't believe I'm doing this right now.
373363	380546	And just even watching the gameplay videos, and I've linked a ton of them on Twitter, it's just, it's awesome.
380966	384628	The only disappointment for me is the lack of multiplayer.
384688	391390	I mean, there's two-player co-op in the single-player campaign, but I really wish there was a deathmatch or something.
391410	392591	Are you worried at all about this?
392651	394732	Because this notoriously happens at E3.
395252	400154	We've been doing a show for nine years now, and I think out of those nine years, we've gone to five or six E3s.
401114	407417	Out of those E3s, we tend to come out of there really liking one game, and then sometimes that game will come out and it sucks.
408298	409658	My case in point, Nintendogs.
409678	413820	I was so excited for Nintendogs when it came out, and it was over in 15 minutes.
413860	415221	Are you worried that's what's going to happen?
415421	420263	No, I am absolutely confident that it's going to be an awesome game, because the other games have been great.
421044	421884	That's the thing.
423505	425166	Saints Row, when it first came out, I'm like, well...
425686	426627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
449639	450159	Let me ask this.
450560	452661	Of course, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that good stuff.
452721	456464	But I'm just dying to ask this question to Loki since we're on the topic of Saints Row III.
456604	459346	Obviously, one of the big games that came out this week was Duke Nukem Forever.
459926	464270	And although I think it's on our show role to cover later in the show, it's no big surprise.
464310	469013	I think a lot of you know Duke Nukem Forever has been really razzed in the gaming press as a whole.
469553	473396	And a lot of it has been about just how – it's almost like –
474918	480805	The sense of humor in the game is to that point where it's like the guy that's so drunk, he's getting really awkward with his humor.
481126	484370	And a lot of people are really saying the humor kind of steps over a line in this game.
484971	489617	But yet, some of those same people are really excited the way you are about Saints Row the Third.
489937	490658	Do you think there's...
491679	495641	A discrepancy, a bit of hypocrisy going on right now in the mainstream gaming press.
495661	499003	It's not hypocrisy, it's just the way they're describing the game is a little inaccurate.
499583	501424	Here's the problem with Duke Nukem Forever.
502424	508547	My main two problems with it right now, and I'm not that far into the game, are... One, the game looks very muddy.
508948	510548	The graphics are very brown.
510568	514931	Yeah, I know a lot of shooters out there tend to kind of go with the brown color palette, but this looks like...
515851	518573	They had a decent-looking game, and then they just splat poo all over it.
518974	528102	I mean, it's just very dark, and even when you're playing it in HD and stuff, it looks like you're playing it on a really low-res screen or something.
528122	532145	The colors just look very... Did Duke literally splash poo on them?
532205	534807	Because I saw in the demo, you can do that now.
535988	539251	Alan was playing it and making me watch, and I was like, really?
540212	540532	Really?
541353	541913	You can fling poo?
541933	542974	But see, that's the problem, though.
543034	543375	Duke knew...
543815	544715	Thanks for watching!
566980	567581	It's not funny.
567741	570883	Oh, haha, all those shooters are crap, so we're going to make our game crap too.
570943	572204	I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
572284	572925	Why would you do that?
573425	574726	And the load time is terrible.
574806	578569	The load time for the game is just ridiculously awful.
579049	583733	And that just screams to me that they just really rushed their way through this game.
583753	584813	And I kind of think that they did.
584873	586615	It's like they went through the motions of everything.
587035	591919	For example, the first two levels that I played through it so far...
593880	594981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
623706	625067	It's kind of pointless.
625107	627509	They spent all their time making all this stuff work.
628049	632092	It sounds like the version of what we really want to do in Sony PlayStation Home.
632933	643000	It's like they took a really run-down car that's just completely broken, and they put shiny rims on it, and they want to make sure those rims are extra polished.
643080	649045	So they spent all their time polishing those rims to make them the shiniest rims you've ever seen, but the car is shit.
649977	651078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
668937	669938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
686818	694901	You see, I think it's, and I think this is obvious, I'm probably stating the obvious here, but I think it's a gross misinterpretation to say this game was in development for 12 years.
695061	695481	It wasn't.
695781	697422	The idea's been kicked around for 12 years.
697482	699682	This game has really been in development for like a year and a half.
700363	701263	But that's terrible, though.
701283	704364	Maybe some art, some things on paper, but come on.
704984	707325	But come on, I've seen games at this company.
707445	708585	They put out Borderlands.
708825	709965	Borderlands was awesome.
710405	712926	Take that damn engine and put it into Duke Nukem.
712966	713926	That's all you need to do.
714006	716267	Just redo the assets and it's perfect.
716327	720308	SalaciousPop is asking, Loki, the 360 or the PS3 console version?
720588	725469	Because the PS3 version is allegedly a leaps and bounds better port and the 360 one is toilet.
725609	725889	It is the 360.
727049	727349	Hmm.
727830	728050	Okay.
728250	730411	But I don't think that the graphics are that different.
730451	731832	It's the color palette and load time.
732492	737335	Scott Pilgrim in our chat says, Gearbox said that they were going to make the game and nothing about it being a spectacular game.
738175	739256	Okay, then why even bother?
739556	742218	Why even bother if you're going to, oh, well, we're just going to finish it.
742378	743899	I mean, we're going to do a shitty job.
744199	746760	Why would you put your name on it then if that's what you're going to do?
746780	754765	If you're going to just sit there and poop out a game that, you know, was half done and you're just going to kind of patch it all together to make sure it works.
755405	756787	Why would you even bother doing that?
756887	758088	Oh, well, we did it for the fans.
758128	759710	Yes, the fans really want a shitty game.
759730	762472	That's what they've been waiting 13 years for, is a really shitty game.
762512	765896	Let me go to this last comment from our chatroom, and then we'll go to our gaming weeks.
766236	771341	KaiJudo in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, I want to know who thought this game was going to be good.
771641	773423	They delayed it 12 years for a reason.
773724	777968	The game would have not seen the light of day if gamers weren't crying about it for all these years.
778188	778649	No, exactly.
778729	783277	I didn't think it was going to be good, but those are my two complaints.
783438	785502	Muddy, long load time.
786408	790091	Disclaimer, I haven't played the game yet, so I don't have an opinion on it one way or the other.
790151	794334	I mean, I can read the reviews, but I also know not to always trust reviews because they're sometimes wrong.
795394	799717	In fact, about a game that I'm going to get into later during my gaming week, I think a lot of review sites got it wrong.
800458	811845	But anyhow, as far as Duke Nukem Forever goes, you know, I think a big part of the reason it came out was because of its legend status that it had in the gaming community.
811885	814107	This is the game you will never get to play.
814727	815588	And obviously,
816588	816948	DarkSakura
836670	843494	Well, to go back to two weeks worth of gaming, I played Kix at Flynn's and Space Paranoids and Tron.
844094	850378	Now, Space Paranoids is funny because Space Paranoids, which is an arcade game that I believe you can only play at Electronica.
850418	851359	I think that's where the only thing is.
851899	857803	It's sitting amongst all these 80s arcades games, and it's made to look like an 80s arcade game, but it's not.
858003	860664	It was something that was made kind of newer.
860744	863526	Like, it's running on a PC, clearly, but it's in a cabinet.
863806	864066	Yeah.
864246	864947	It's kind of interesting.
865367	866448	Yeah, that's what it was for.
867369	874234	But it makes sense that they'd put it in with Electronica because, I mean, it was the big game when the first Tron came out, you know, in the movie.
874454	877497	Well, and Disney's very about getting you in the experience.
877597	881920	You know, like when you go on Space Mountain, you are boarding a spaceship and about to go through the galaxy.
882281	883722	Space Mountain is not a roller coaster.
883762	886124	If a Disney employee ever called it a roller coaster, they'd be sacked.
886684	887404	It's a spaceship.
887804	888785	That's how it works.
889105	892326	So when you go to Flynn's Arcade, I mean, it's very much a detail thing.
892366	897328	And because Space Paranoids was a game that Kevin Flynn, that's what he made all his money developing, right?
897748	900989	They had to make it to be true in that experience.
901269	906131	Well, to me, technically, Dillinger stole it from him and made all the money and then, yeah, just watched it.
906151	906771	Blah, blah, blah.
906791	907412	All right, fine.
907432	908712	It's my favorite Disney movie.
911333	913596	We are... Crap, what else did I play?
914597	916639	Oh, BlackWolf says you can actually play it online as well.
916939	918901	SpacePiranoidsOnline.com Thank you.
921824	922485	Played some WoW.
923686	925007	I played VVVVVV.
925528	926689	Game's frustrating as hell.
927057	929198	I hear it's a really well-received indie title, though.
929218	930118	I haven't played it myself.
930318	930838	It's fun.
930878	931659	What do you do in that game?
932579	935940	You don't necessarily have a jump as much as you have a reverse gravity.
936780	939381	And so to get over traps, you have to play with gravity.
939401	941822	You're either walking on the bottom or you're walking on the ceiling.
942082	942742	That sounds kind of neat.
943123	945463	It is, but it's frustrating and a little difficult.
946204	947464	It took a little bit to get used to.
947484	953066	I played some Peggle and played some Portal.
954485	956107	Portal 2, of course, right?
972523	978610	I can read enough in that to get an idea of what menu is what, but it's very Japanese intensive.
979030	982093	It's pretty good though, but only has like two songs in it in one story mode.
982113	986778	So it's got like, I think two extra tracks than what the arcade version has.
987659	990863	I think the arcade version is the fourth stage game.
991303	994466	All I can say is hooray for region-free PlayStation, right?
994526	995567	So you can do that stuff.
996608	997909	Yeah.
998329	1005116	But it gave him an excuse to bring back out the rig that he bought for Gran Turismo.
1007177	1011722	And it actually works really good for the PS2 initial D game.
1012542	1013703	Just thought I would point that out.
1016846	1017186	And then...
1019358	1020699	I guess that's really about it.
1020979	1026242	I know I played some other stuff, but my brain's not working, so... I'm just gonna say stuff.
1027163	1028343	Alright, let's go... Oh!
1028944	1030164	World Cup Soccer Pinball.
1030404	1030985	Hell yeah.
1031165	1031585	Of course.
1032426	1032686	Of course.
1032986	1035828	Alright, let's go to Loki, and how was your gaming week?
1036468	1037689	Obviously you've played some Duke Nukem.
1038629	1039029	A little bit.
1039590	1041631	Yeah, a little bit of Duke Nukem.
1043412	1046514	Pretty much just... You know, a little bit of Duke Nukem.
1047514	1047654	Um...
1049389	1051915	A little bit of, well, lots of Grand Theft Auto.
1052776	1053378	And, um...
1055148	1055928	That's pretty much it.
1056008	1057549	I really didn't play a whole lot.
1058289	1058629	Alright.
1059390	1060830	Not every week can be so exciting.
1062091	1065212	I actually kind of had one of those weeks where I didn't really play a lot of new stuff.
1065232	1067833	The only new game I played is not new.
1068313	1076676	I played LittleBigPlanet on the PSP because obviously this is one of the free games that they're giving away as part of the whole Welcome Back program.
1076716	1081378	So that was one of the ones I chose to get because I love the original on PlayStation 3.
1081998	1083259	So I decided to get this one.
1083439	1083819	I'm not
1083899	1086020	All the levels so far seem to be pretty faithfully recreated.
1108889	1112212	I haven't really got into the whole online stuff and the levels on there.
1112432	1114854	In fact, I can't even access that yet.
1116195	1123681	I was starting to wonder for a minute if they're even there, but there's a planet for download levels, so I'll have to look into that a little more later on and how all that works.
1123921	1126944	I can't really review the game, but I did play it for about an hour or so.
1127584	1149338	but the game I've been spending most of my time with I actually revisited a game that I started playing about 15 months ago but I never finished and I think part of it was just at that time I was really heavy into WoW and I wasn't really playing any other games and then I loaned my copy of it to DarkSakura for like a year so I just got it back when we got back from the Disneyland trip this past Sunday and that's Final Fantasy XIII
1150579	1172084	and I have I started over on Final Fantasy 13 because I'm one of those people that with an RPG if I can't remember the story and where I was at then screw it I'm starting over and so I started the entire game over and I have spent more time in the past week playing it than I did in its original run when I first played it uh I'm already past the point where I was before so
1173084	1174445	I've been having a lot of fun with that game.
1196432	1199174	But one of the strengths of Final Fantasy XIII for me, of course, is the battle system.
1199454	1200694	I love the battle system in XIII.
1200714	1201535	It's one of my favorites.
1201555	1204376	Like, the whole paradigm shifts into the different classes.
1204696	1214582	If you've never played, the battle system in XIII is like, you know, you can be a black mage one minute, and then you do, like, a paradigm shift, and suddenly you're more of a buffing or debuff mage.
1214762	1216863	Like, I guess that would be like a... What are those?
1216883	1218744	The green mages, I think, that did a lot of that in V?
1220005	1249086	and then you know you can switch again and you're more of like a warrior it's pretty cool just flipping back and forth in the different battles I really like that and then a lot of people bitching about the characters in the game as well and I think again you know if you stick with it a lot of the characters don't end up so one dimensional if you play the game for more than 10 hours of gameplay you know some of the characters like the kids are the ones that usually get a lot of hate Hope and Vanille and those two characters are
1249866	1254369	Get much more rounded out as you continue on with the game.
1254429	1256371	So I think it's worth it if you stick with it.
1256731	1263075	But at the same time, I also understand why if a game doesn't grab you right away, you're not so inclined to want to stick with it.
1263596	1268419	I think visually, graphically, and sound-wise, there's enough to keep me entertained.
1268759	1272602	I think the graphics in this game are so freaking gorgeous.
1272782	1274403	I can't even explain.
1274723	1276965	You just like to watch pretty things.
1277005	1279046	There's plenty here to keep you entertained for a while.
1279766	1285792	But I think part of the big motivator why I wanted to go back and play this game was just hearing about Final Fantasy XIII-2 from E3.
1285832	1291156	And it sounds like in this game they have really addressed a lot of the things that people didn't like about the first game.
1291396	1297021	Like one of the things I noticed right off the bat were maps, even in the little trailer, that were not linear.
1297442	1300684	Maps that showed big environments and open worlds.
1300764	1305489	So I have a feeling XIII-2 is really going to correct what a lot of people didn't like about XIII-2.
1306209	1309734	But I want to be able to understand the story, so I wanted to actually just play through 13.
1309834	1312518	I mean, I could have just read spoilers, but I didn't really want to.
1312899	1313660	I wanted to play it.
1314742	1315222	That's where I'm at.
1315302	1316043	I haven't beat it yet.
1316324	1317566	Hopefully by this time next week.
1317766	1318106	We'll see.
1318247	1319829	I don't even know if I'm halfway through yet, though.
1319849	1320830	I'm about...
1322768	1346646	Chapter 9 or so So, anyhow That's it for my gaming week At least all is notable Of course I play more WoW and things like that too But that's all I'll mention on tonight's show So, let's move on to some housekeeping Then we'll get into the news tonight One big thing, of course, I wanted to say in the housekeeping tonight was Happy Father's Day To all the gamer dads out there Which would include Loki Yeah, it's your first Father's Day, right?
1347186	1349248	So, congratulations to you on that
1349808	1351351	What all chores did you get to do today?
1351431	1353034	Yeah, what chores did you make your son do today?
1353054	1353735	How many diapers?
1354576	1358122	I just had to watch the baby all day and take my wife out to lunch.
1359881	1361302	No, sorry, I said take my wife out for lunch.
1363003	1363203	Nice.
1363984	1367587	Looking at chat.orangelunchradio.com, some comments on Final Fantasy XIII.
1367947	1371149	Scott Pilgrim says, but Sky, the game gives you a brief recap, though.
1371610	1375813	It does, and the data log is very impressive, but I don't know.
1376093	1378975	I still just, I wanted to start from scratch, so I did.
1379155	1381116	I figured it wouldn't take me that long to catch up, and it didn't.
1382338	1387609	Anyhow, on the Father's Day topic too, of course, happy Father's Day to all the gamer dads out there or father figures.
1387949	1392900	If you have someone out there that considers you their dad, then happy Father's Day to you.
1393652	1397534	Meanwhile, friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio.
1397554	1400176	We're on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash olr.
1400256	1403398	And visit our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
1403978	1405879	It would be nice if we had more posts in the forums there.
1406599	1410141	Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news.
1410362	1411722	And we'll start off with Loki.
1412463	1412923	Ah, yes.
1413323	1413724	News.
1413824	1417005	And of course, we're going to start off talking about Wii U and some of the...
1418566	1419246	Thanks for watching!
1442251	1457919	Right now, apparently the Wii U console will be using a custom Radeon GPU with a chip similar to the R770, basically a chip that's found in some of the last generation ATI cards.
1458820	1467430	For example, the 770 is in the 4870, which is a decent card.
1467470	1473237	It's better than some of the stuff they have right now in the current-gen consoles.
1475459	1483266	So, it's good, but who knows, you know, by the time that these next-gen consoles come out, you know, what they're going to be packing.
1483486	1490032	But it will be able to hold up with at least the 360 and PS3 and may even be able to push better graphics than that, so that's kind of cool.
1492950	1505374	And of course, also, it came out that the Wii U will not have a DVD or Blu-ray playback, mainly because it will actually be used in its own proprietary disc format.
1506294	1519338	And there also explains, well, Wii U doesn't have DVD or Blu-ray playback capabilities because the cost, and also they figured that enough people already have devices that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray.
1520758	1522479	Good decision on Nintendo's part, or bad?
1523446	1537301	Um, it's probably true to a certain extent, and also I think it helps them as far as piracy goes, because if it's their own disc format, you can't pop it, you know, if it's unable to read DVDs, you can't burn a game onto a DVD.
1538202	1545210	Or, you know, in the case, I mean, these games are going to be multiple gigabytes anyways, but you can't burn a Blu-ray backup or something like that.
1546454	1548135	So it's going to use its own little format there.
1548155	1549996	You're going to have to rip it off a hard drive.
1553298	1555060	At first I was surprised.
1555120	1558542	I was like, wow, they're not going to support a movie format.
1558562	1559563	That's kind of shocking.
1559583	1563385	But then at the same time I was like, well, what Nintendo console really did support a movie format?
1563465	1566027	I mean, GameCube didn't even play CDs.
1566747	1572291	Wii certainly doesn't play DVDs unless I guess you do some hacking with it, which doesn't really count.
1573551	1577493	But it does Netflix, and I'm sure this new system is going to do the Netflix and the Hulu and all that.
1577993	1583396	And I guess now we're in a different spot with our movies than we were 10 years ago.
1583416	1589558	I think there's a lot of people that rely on things like Netflix and Hulu and all the other download things to get their movies.
1589598	1594700	And I think as long as Nintendo supports Netflix, which I'm sure it will, I think that's going to be enough.
1594740	1595601	That's probably all it needs.
1595721	1597041	I mean, the Wii was the best-selling system.
1597081	1597962	It didn't even play DVDs.
1598542	1604787	I always thought it was a little weird to hear that Nintendo might go Blu-ray, because Blu-ray is a Sony format, and I always thought that was a little weird.
1605708	1612534	Yeah, but you can't really, I mean, they have their own proprietary format right now, but I don't know, it's...
1613516	1616459	You kind of either have to make your own or use theirs.
1636078	1637619	Maybe it's what you're going to get for Christmas this year.
1659492	1660173	is coming out.
1661033	1664235	So yeah, Kirby is supposed to be in the fall, out at some point.
1664776	1669419	Some of the other games that are coming from Nintendo, they're putting out on the Wii.
1669739	1672061	Wii Play Motion on June 13th.
1672421	1675723	Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave incident, on June 27th.
1676404	1677565	Kirby Wii is in the fall.
1677965	1679806	Fortune Street will be during the holiday.
1679946	1681687	Of course, Zelda Skyward Sword.
1682208	1686751	Also, Mario Party 9 and Rhythm Heaven on the Wii are announced for later this year.
1687411	1689753	Coming out from Nintendo on the DS later this year.
1689873	1691254	Not the 3DS, but the DS.
1691635	1700301	Dragon Quest Monsters, Joker 2, Kirby Mass Attack, Professor Layton and the Last Spectre for the fall, and Super Fossil Fighters over the holiday.
1701002	1703664	Some of the other releases on the Wii, let me just kind of throw it out there.
1703724	1707727	From Sega, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
1707767	1709509	That will be in November.
1710609	1739378	Ubisoft is putting out more game show ports Family Feud 2012 and Price is Right Decades in September Just Dance 3 in the fall WB Interactive has some movie tie-in games also the Sesame Street franchise going on there and then lastly Konami has Dance Dance Revolution 2 in the fall and what's sure to be a favorite here at OLR Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3 in the fall
1739798	1740598	Woohoo!
1741899	1742059	Yeah.
1742820	1745021	Anyhow, how about the 3DS?
1745281	1754486	And moving forward, obviously the 3DS needs some bigger games in order to make people really want to get it because the launch titles have not been that great.
1754806	1759388	Although, Zelda's out now, which of course was released today.
1759408	1764651	So that was one of the big releases and there's a lot of people probably going to jump on board finally for that game.
1765091	1792186	but if not Zelda then maybe Star Fox 64 3D which is dated for September 11th yeah it's Loki's birthday Kid Icarus will be during the holiday as will Mario Kart and Super Mario however you'll have to wait until 2012 to play Lego City Stories and Luigi's Mansion 2 not dated yet Animal Crossing and Paper Mario so I would assume those games are all the way out next summer would be my guess so
1792967	1813608	Some of the other things that are coming out on the 3DS Ubisoft is putting out all that crap that they put out on the DS That sells millions Pets Fantasy, Horses 3D, Imagine Babies 3D Raving Rabbids 5, maybe a little more in the direction of stuff we'd actually play Is coming out on the 3DS as well
1813928	1829729	Konami's putting out Frogger 3D in the fall They've dated Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater for the winter Majesco's got Cooking Mama 4, Kitchen Magic slated for October 11th Capcom's got Resident Evil The Mercenaries dated June 28th I didn't realize that was coming out so soon
1830229	1849146	Resident Evil Revelations is a little further out and then lastly from Activision they've got Spider-Man in the fall and a Transformers game to support the movie in June so there is lots of stuff for the 3DS from the various third parties as well as Nintendo themselves all the way through the rest of the year so DarkSakura going back to the Wii U
1850187	1856949	In other Wii U news, they are only doing one controller for it because of some cost issue.
1857649	1864451	Basically, Iwata said that they don't want buyers to have to buy multiple Wii U controllers.
1865451	1877374	And by putting in different aspects of multiplayer that would involve the controller, they would be pretty much insisting that people buy another Wii U controller and they were trying to cut down costs for the consumer.
1878575	1880740	I kind of don't see where that matters.
1881622	1887614	I think just put in a strong single player and then, you know, later on add in
1889611	1892975	Here's the problem, in my opinion, is that the Wii is a party system.
1893476	1897700	The Wii, especially when it first came out, was that system that got busted out at all the parties.
1897741	1898862	Let's play Wii Tennis.
1898962	1900143	Let's play Mario Party.
1900203	1902646	Let's play, you know, Smash Brothers, whatever the game was.
1902686	1905530	It was very much about a lot of those multiplayer experiences.
1905930	1908933	So it's very surprising that they've kind of said, well...
1909514	1914937	Multiplayer is not really going to be like that on the Wii U. I mean, granted, you will be able to use the Wiimote.
1914977	1917158	You will be able to use the classic controller.
1917498	1920839	So it's not like multiplayer experiences will be non-existent.
1922080	1935807	But when this controller is such a huge factor of what they're trying to drive, it's interesting that there's not going to be a thing where I could bring my Wii U controller over to someone else's house and play on that controller.
1936877	1943220	but it's also not surprising because remember that controller is not a processor.
1943781	1948183	The image that you see on that Wii U controller is not being processed by the controller.
1948503	1958348	That's the biggest difference between the Wii U setup and what you've probably most familiar with leading into this would be the GameCube going to the Game Boy Advance.
1958368	1960349	Those Game Boy Advances had processors in them.
1960690	1964732	They could process the data and so forth but the Wii U is all streaming from the box.
1965572	1974837	So it makes sense that it can't maybe stream to more than one, although I think I read somewhere where it is actually capable of streaming to more than one, but it won't be as good.
1975297	1979059	I don't know, but it's going to be interesting.
1979159	1988324	I think there will be plenty of multiplayer experiences with the Classic Controller involved, and certainly all the demos they were showing were just the one and the Wiimotes, but...
1989484	1994389	Yeah, it's a little disappointing to know that they're not going to try and do more.
1994469	1996692	But I guess it would be expensive to do that.
1997412	1999094	I mean, these controllers are probably going to be like $100.
1999154	2003799	And I know they've said they're not going to sell them separately, but what if I lose mine?
2004239	2004299	Or...
2006161	2021916	I honestly don't think the controllers are going to be about $100 a pop I really don't think so I think you're maybe looking at especially since it itself doesn't contain the processor I think you're really going to be looking at more around $50 for the controller
2023337	2027479	GameGuru in our chatroom says, I think this will kill the Wii U more than anything else.
2029000	2031401	Again, at the end of the day, it's really all about the games.
2031481	2040426	Like, I have a really hard time being able to assess Wii U right now because, you know, sure, I saw E3 like you guys did and, you know, I see the controller and so forth and the demos.
2041046	2042007	But, I mean, they're not...
2043187	2045189	No real games were shown.
2045669	2054695	I mean, maybe like a couple of very loose conceptual things like Ghost Recon and what have you, but I'm sorry, there's not enough of what are the games really going to look like on this thing?
2055015	2057517	And I don't think we're really going to know that answer until next E3.
2057637	2060359	So I feel like I can't really judge the system.
2061019	2063821	until I see how does this really play out?
2064201	2067563	Or have they been able to think around these constraints really well?
2067944	2075649	And to Nintendo's credit, I think that's one thing they do really well is that they design awesome games for the confines that they've built.
2076729	2077190	So we'll see.
2077290	2079711	Frisbee in our chatroom says, Congratulations, Nintendo.
2079731	2082653	You defeated the entire purpose to buy this console for its controller.
2082974	2087016	Can you imagine what families with multiple kids in it fighting over this controller?
2087797	2087977	Hmm.
2088510	2095631	I honestly think that's going to be the big reveal before it's released is that you get one of the Wii U controllers but you can also use your other I think that's going to be the big thing
2118427	2118747	We'll see.
2141269	2142210	It can do Miis.
2142490	2143311	Oh my god.
2143692	2145133	So can the normal Wii.
2145333	2146555	Why even show that off?
2146715	2147475	It was just stupid.
2147556	2154843	I think the Chase Mii and the Shield stuff will ultimately get slapped into some minigame collection that is what the system will come with.
2155584	2156685	Wii U Party or something like that.
2156705	2159868	Oh yeah, all the tech demos are going to be in the fucking... They're going to be sold at some point.
2160249	2161610	Oh, we're not going to sell these games.
2161630	2162491	These aren't real games.
2163283	2166949	No, you're going to sell these games because this is what you do, Nintendo.
2167510	2170035	You're like, hmm, how can we get away with the least amount of work?
2170055	2172379	Well, we made these tech demos and we're just sitting on them.
2172519	2175664	Let's put them together and charge 50 bucks for them.
2175684	2177127	We'll throw in a Wiimote.
2177369	2179511	They're going to the Weasley School of Test Design.
2181292	2182032	The Wheatley School.
2182873	2188036	I think that Nintendo, they still have a long time before this comes out.
2188157	2191259	And I think they're going to have a lot of time to respond to some of this criticism.
2191679	2200045	And I could definitely see Reggie coming out on stage at the next E3 saying, well, we heard a lot about this that you guys didn't like, so we did this.
2200565	2202246	And what was it he said?
2202286	2203127	Contradictions?
2203567	2204248	We can do that.
2204648	2205308	Thanks for watching!
2232042	2257481	we know nothing about online that's the thing I can't sit here and tell you I'm going to buy a Wii U or I'm not going to buy a Wii U and I don't think honestly any of you can sit here and tell me that you are or you aren't buying one because we don't really know we have an idea we've got the idea we see the direction Nintendo's going but we don't see the path and I think they've got a year to really impress us next E3 I'll tell you
2258632	2260433	If I think the Wii U is for me or not.
2261554	2262054	What, Loki?
2262074	2262815	You're laughing over there.
2262835	2265656	I'm just like thinking, you know, the direction that they're gonna come out.
2265797	2269239	It's just gonna be the same old shit with another gimmick attached to it.
2269679	2271100	It's what it really is gonna end up.
2271160	2281526	They're gonna take you through this elaborate path of promises and hopes and stuff and then we're gonna just get right back to the Wii with a gimmicky piece of shit that's now another controller for it.
2282847	2284348	People love gimmicky pieces of shit.
2284508	2286229	Why else is the Wii been the number one console?
2286389	2286990	Number one!
2288575	2291376	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2317330	2333026	I gotta read, there's actually a couple really good comments in chat I want to get here, now we get some stuff on the Wii U here Scott Pilgrim says, I'll buy a Wii U when Mario Kart comes out, if that GameGuru says, all of them will be put into Wii U Sports and be packaged with the console, save New Super Mario Bros.
2333086	2336110	Me which will come out separately and sell like 20 million copies
2336790	2340693	SSJ100 Matt says, I felt Nintendo was forced into announcing the Wii U right now.
2341053	2343955	Developers were working on games for it and was starting to leak out.
2344275	2347678	They had to talk about it this E3 because they wanted to put their spin on it.
2347978	2351020	If you think about it, they did the same thing with the Wii Revolution.
2351941	2352901	I agree.
2353282	2355763	I feel like it was too early, but I understand they had to.
2355944	2356404	They had to.
2356644	2357244	No, they didn't.
2357725	2358485	Why did they have to?
2358565	2360006	Because it would have been leaked out otherwise.
2360046	2360847	It was already leaked out.
2360867	2362068	We all knew it was a touchpad.
2362608	2363149	We all knew.
2363169	2363409	So what?
2364858	2365318	Big deal.
2365438	2366520	So what if something leaks out?
2366540	2367922	You don't have to go and confirm it.
2368804	2369865	You can just be motivated.
2369946	2372049	It's still a wise corporate policy.
2372069	2375594	They want to convince the world that they're on to the next video.
2375695	2376997	They want their stocks to go up.
2377057	2377998	Well, that didn't work.
2379080	2379681	It went down.
2379961	2390334	So whenever I come just looking from a corporate point of view, they have a product there that they don't want misperceptions on.
2390534	2395801	They want people to see it the way they want people to see it, not just with speculation.
2397199	2398280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2420712	2428035	People by far out of this E3 are talking about Wii U and then probably in a, you know, distant second, the Vita.
2428776	2434078	And then in a, Microsoft doesn't even chart with what they showed.
2434238	2435699	I mean, to the gamers, yeah.
2435759	2438660	I mean, Halo 4, I guess, would be maybe like a way distant third.
2438920	2465770	whoopity shit that's what I say about Halo 4 and I'm not knocking Microsoft I'm just saying they didn't show anything at the press conference that really has people buzzing but of course they didn't show a new console although they did show that whole cable TV thing which I thought was going to be a lot bigger deal than it seems to be but whatever anyhow if it was leaked out not on their terms then it would have been misconstrued and confused so what Jamie said
2467841	2469103	GameGuru says, I'm not sure.
2469143	2473427	It depends on if the Wii U's uniqueness can overshadow Kinect among the casuals.
2474028	2479774	DoomPlague in chat.orangehustler.com says, they needed to get the attention of publishers, developers on board.
2480134	2483158	That was the whole point of showing the Wii U, in my opinion.
2483678	2484339	Alright, let's move on.
2484399	2486441	I want to talk about something that's not Nintendo.
2486761	2490105	I know it's a three hour show, but there's plenty of other news going on too.
2490734	2501877	Well, Bungie is celebrating their 20th anniversary, and of course they're going to reveal some new things about Bungie, including this Bungie Aerospace thing that they've been teasing for a while.
2502977	2512479	Among that stuff, and actually I think it's available now, if you have an iOS device, you can download an actual application.
2512519	2513040	That's free.
2515260	2515981	That's kind of neat.
2516121	2519004	It basically kind of ties in with the Bungie website.
2519425	2528634	It's called Bungie Mobile, and you can check out your stats for reach and all sorts of stuff.
2528694	2532438	You can sign up for giveaways and... Downloading.
2533018	2534039	Halo, Combat Evolved HD
2559679	2565304	And with that, they're going to have six custom-made Duke controllers.
2566205	2574834	Now, remember, the Duke controller is the original Xbox controller, the one that was the size of a small, you know, single-family home.
2574954	2576616	The size of Duke Nukem's ego.
2576636	2576716	Yeah.
2578617	2583439	So they're going to have those made in a very limited run and they're going to be auctioned off as well.
2583839	2594842	And I guess Halo Fest will run alongside PAX Prime from Friday, August 26th to Sunday, August 28th at the Washington State Convention Center.
2595823	2599444	Which, by the way, admission is free if you have your PAX badge.
2600823	2605467	DarkSakura, you hated those old Xbox controllers, didn't you?
2605487	2606689	Because my hands are smaller.
2606709	2607289	It really did.
2607349	2609331	It was just painful after a while, but I mean...
2623864	2628646	I can handle a big controller as long as the ergonomics are reasonable.
2629126	2634827	Saturn Dual Analog Controller, I've told everybody that's my favorite controller ever, but it's kind of bulky.
2635688	2640249	But it fits reasonably in the hand, and that's the problem, is that my thumbs just won't reach.
2643679	2646860	I never actually touched one of the original Xbox controller.
2646900	2650380	By the time I bought an Xbox, I bought... I could fix that.
2650540	2654561	I'm sure I've mentioned this on the show before, but when I bought an Xbox, I actually bought a Halo Xbox.
2654961	2657642	It's a green, translucent kind of Xbox.
2657722	2659362	It's very different from the other ones that are out there.
2659822	2660722	That's the same one we have.
2660982	2661242	Oh, yeah?
2661822	2666063	Yeah, they were limited edition or something, but it came with Halo.
2666743	2668844	Believe it or not, when I first played Halo, I loved it.
2668864	2671324	Yeah, I played it at a wedding.
2672898	2677260	My friends got married and it was a Halo, it's kind of a very subtle Halo theme to the wedding.
2677740	2680001	And yeah, they were just those kinds of people.
2680061	2682242	It was like, okay, we're married, let's play Halo.
2682282	2686863	And everybody brought TVs and it was like a local area thing because obviously Xbox Live wasn't on the first one.
2687203	2687784	It was fun.
2687964	2690585	Do you know that that's exactly what my husband's bachelor party was?
2691005	2691265	Yeah.
2691945	2699188	Was cases of beer, about eight TVs set up all over my house, and lots of Halo land.
2700908	2703249	Meanwhile, you remember my party.
2703769	2705229	Let's watch XANA do and go drink.
2705249	2705810	I do, I do.
2705830	2706890	All right.
2706930	2709211	Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelongerator.com.
2709231	2711852	GameGuru says, The Duke should be stricken from memory.
2711912	2713812	Controller S was vastly superior.
2714373	2718494	SSJ100Matt says, The Dreamcast controller was bulky, but it was one of my favorite controllers.
2718594	2720094	I really like the Dreamcast controller, too.
2720635	2723916	I love the whole idea of the VMUs.
2724636	2726837	It's kind of a bummer that didn't really stick.
2726877	2727397	I mean, I guess...
2727677	2728258	and DarkSakura.com
2743596	2746097	Anyhow, let's talk about free stuff.
2746197	2747978	That's right, free games, legal.
2748198	2750319	This whole thing's illegal free games.
2750559	2754881	If you're looking for something new to play, you need to look no further past Steam.
2755661	2759983	Steam has added five free-to-play games available on Steam.
2760263	2762204	You can download them just like anything else.
2762624	2765205	These are all free-to-play MMOs.
2765305	2766666	The games are Spiral Knights.
2767386	2768546	I should say free-to-play games.
2768566	2769607	They're not all necessarily MMOs.
2769927	2777190	Spiral Knights, Forsaken Worlds, Champions Online Free For All, Global Agenda Free Agent, and Alliance of Valiant Arms.
2777230	2780231	They are all on Steam right now, available for you to download.
2780872	2782272	I know some people have been checking them out.
2782492	2785434	I've seen our webmaster, Deekman, has been playing Spiral Knights.
2785494	2786834	I saw some of his pictures.
2787254	2790436	And they got to the point where it was like, hey, you want to keep playing the good stuff?
2790896	2792176	Now you got to give us money.
2792637	2795538	So that's the only bummer with the free-to-play games is that
2796358	2799720	A lot of them really just feel like extended demos.
2801201	2804322	Especially, like, what was that one on PlayStation 3 that was so stupid?
2804642	2805183	Free Realms.
2805643	2806863	The one where you can play as a fairy.
2808624	2810505	Everything is blocked off unless you pay for it.
2810525	2811606	That's why I haven't downloaded anything.
2811666	2812486	They're just demos.
2813247	2815748	But, I don't know, some people get more out of this.
2815808	2820330	I hear some of these other ones have a little more robust experience, like Champions Online and Global Agenda.
2820350	2823472	A little more of the robust experience, but I haven't played them myself.
2823939	2827723	but if you are looking for something new to try maybe these things will be up your alley check it out
2848010	2849190	It actually feels super natural.
2849330	2850791	It's not super natural, but you know what I mean?
2850871	2852731	Really easy to do.
2853291	2861253	The D-pad's a little weird, kind of like it is on Xbox, but I really like this 360... What the hell's the name of these?
2861293	2861813	The analog?
2862053	2864154	In my opinion, it's the best controller ever made.
2866414	2866814	There you go.
2867835	2869115	Oh, Loki wants to touch it.
2869594	2873395	Well, while Loki's touching my controller, I'll go ahead and read the next story.
2873415	2873975	How's that sound?
2875036	2875336	Sure.
2876296	2878657	Zynga likes to sue people.
2879357	2883738	Well, now they have another company they're going after called Vostu.
2884478	2888479	It's a Brazilian company and they are getting in on Cityville.
2888499	2890200	They have Vostu's Mega City.
2891101	2902333	and if you look at the screen captures it's fairly identical although I have to say that some of Vostu's in-game sprites actually look a lot nicer but they are
2905660	2907241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2925631	2944762	Vostu has brazenly appropriated the copyright protected aspects of Zynga's games as well as almost every other aspect of Zynga's business with scant effort to mask their strategy and then offered games virtually identical to Zynga's games to prospective players in the United States and elsewhere.
2945562	2952809	and they did side-by-side video with cleaning a pet.
2953309	2954290	The whole video is here.
2957193	2960316	But they also copied mistakes.
2960636	2962618	So it looks like they're actually copying code.
2963999	2964700	Things that were...
2966261	2966682	and so on.
2987041	2990023	It looks like there's quite a bit going on.
2990304	2993926	The whole lawsuit actually is online.
2998489	3002772	It looks like they're trying to get them to shut down operations.
3003213	3011719	If you also look at the... They had to raise $45.9 million in funds, Vostu did, to get their thing going.
3013220	3013420	So...
3013940	3018344	I find this stuff kind of ironic because didn't Zynga kind of get their start copying other people's games?
3018384	3021306	Like isn't Farmville taken from Farmtown or something?
3021426	3022807	Well, here's the other thing.
3023227	3032374	Looking at the company's stats too is that Vostu was founded February 1st, 2007.
3032455	3034896	Zynga was founded July 2007 with more money behind them.
3039840	3040301	Interesting.
3040581	3045164	And Vostu is located in New York, whereas Zynga is located in San Francisco.
3045904	3046124	Hmm.
3046905	3048406	So, fairly interesting.
3048506	3050047	It's an East Coast, West Coast thing.
3050067	3050667	That's right.
3053209	3056491	It's gonna go down, and it's all gonna go down in Cityville.
3057292	3059973	There's gonna be drive-by shootings and things.
3060013	3061234	They're just gonna have to prove it.
3061454	3063856	It's basically gonna come down to which code is older.
3065557	3065817	You know?
3065837	3067058	Mm-hmm.
3067893	3077029	But yeah, looking at these photos, and I'll show the chat room too, it's pretty identical.
3077069	3080996	Obviously, Zynga feels pretty confident in this or they wouldn't be suing, so, you know.
3082566	3083286	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3107733	3116818	This girl basically was just pointing out stuff in the Forever 21 catalog that was ugly and blogging about it.
3117298	3127943	And they're saying that she's copying their stuff when Forever 21 is a big copier of actual designers like Anna Sui and big name designers.
3129204	3129925	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3155859	3157400	It all comes down to the source code.
3158060	3159281	It all comes down to the source code.
3159761	3160221	We'll see.
3161282	3161622	All right.
3161662	3167565	Anyhow, we're going to move on and cover some release dates and check out what is coming out to a gaming store near you very soon.
3167605	3169686	We'll start off in the U.S.
3170306	3171147	In the U.S.
3171267	3172187	state of Japan.
3172507	3175889	I almost said Japan because I was bringing up my Japanese dates, but we're not starting there.
3175909	3178911	Actually, some decent stuff this week.
3179411	3180631	Not a whole lot, though.
3180691	3181572	I mean, it's still...
3182694	3184595	Man, it's still a slow time of the year.
3186436	3188757	From EA, though, and this is kind of cool.
3188817	3200203	It's kind of a collaboration between, I want to say, Suda51 and the guy that created Resident Evil.
3200563	3204425	And basically, it's Shadows of the Damned, kind of a Grindhouse-ish...
3207293	3210295	I kind of call it a grindhouse-ish Dante's Inferno game.
3211056	3211816	But it's pretty awesome.
3212257	3216360	So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3217681	3221243	Also, I believe that they are re-releasing...
3222965	3223845	Call of Duty Black Ops
3249726	3257912	Today, or I believe actually, no, later this week, Wii Play Motion will be coming out from Nintendo.
3258172	3264618	And that, of course, is not a minigame collection, of course, because why would they throw tech demos into a game?
3265478	3267620	That will also be coming with the Wii Remote Plus.
3268261	3270723	Cars 2, the video game, tied in with the upcoming movie.
3270743	3273465	It's on all major formats, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3273565	3273645	Also...
3280592	3308094	Gods and Heroes Rome Rising that's coming out on PC there's some PSP 2 packs that are coming out kind of some cheap games Kills and Liberation, Siphon Filters Logan Challenger that's on PSP for $14.99 not bad and then also they have a couple other collections this week as well I'm trying to remember what they were
3309878	3310519	Let's see here.
3311099	3311780	Oh, I'll get back to that.
3312160	3313802	Anyways, Fear 3 also this week.
3314362	3315223	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
3322225	3331952	Arma 2 Reinforcements on PC, Dual Pen Sports on the 3DS, which I'm not sure how that works considering that the 3DS is not multi-touch.
3332832	3336555	Pets Fantasy for the 3DS.
3337295	3340978	Yes, now bringing the ever-loved Pets franchise to the 3DS.
3341398	3342158	Thank you, Ubisoft.
3342178	3344400	Yeah, I know everyone's excited about that.
3345200	3345341	And...
3348220	3348320	D.S.
3364483	3385437	Alright, moving over to Japan and looking at what is coming out on the Japanese releases this week Coming out on June 23rd, which by the way also happens to be the 9th birthday of OLR, June 23rd Grand Theft Auto 4, the complete edition coming out in Japan Might seem a little late, but I believe those releases are localized for Japan So they have to go back and redo the text and the acting and all that stuff
3386118	3404080	so that is coming out finally this week that is the big release on Xbox 360 coming out on PlayStation 3 this week on the 23rd some more choices for you Mass Effect 2 the Japanese release is out this week as well as of course the Grand Theft Auto 4 collection Bleach Soul Ignition out from Sony this week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan
3404580	3408242	and lastly, a game called Meruwu no Atelier.
3408622	3412944	Arland no Rekenjutsushi comes out this week from Gust.
3413565	3416226	And I don't know if this is a game that is out here.
3416246	3416606	Yes, it is.
3416966	3417187	Is it?
3417287	3417787	What is this?
3417887	3419668	Is this the... Oh, Atelier.
3419908	3421329	They do have the Atelier series out here.
3422449	3424270	Yes, this is like a role-playing game.
3424290	3425231	I think we have one of these at home.
3425251	3426831	We haven't played yet, like the last one in the series.
3427992	3429753	So that's on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3430633	3432713	And then moving on to some of the other consoles.
3432934	3436715	Going to the Nintendo Wii this week.
3437995	3439296	Actually, let me do the PSP first.
3439456	3441056	Gloria Union this week.
3441236	3442456	And Gundam Memories.
3442817	3444937	Tataki no Kyoku comes out this week.
3446398	3446618	And...
3447523	3448064	Earthseeker Earthseeker
3463240	3464681	Whatever happened to The Last Guardian?
3464701	3466883	I thought they were going to announce that at E3 this year for the Wii.
3466903	3469826	That's supposed to be a kick-ass game on the Wii.
3469966	3471227	For The Last Guardian?
3471627	3472388	No, not The Last Guardian.
3472788	3473329	Damn it, no.
3473409	3474770	I'm thinking that's the PlayStation 3.
3474990	3475691	What am I thinking of?
3476271	3478113	There's some big role-playing game from Mistwalker.
3478133	3478673	Last Story.
3478833	3479714	Thank you, Last Story.
3480094	3480995	One word difference.
3482697	3484118	Completely different games, though.
3484158	3484778	Yeah, sorry.
3484839	3485299	My bad.
3485759	3486020	All right.
3486380	3488141	Nintendo 3DS in Japan this week.
3488382	3489042	Fish Eyes 3D.
3491365	3491946	Thanks for watching!
3510506	3512687	Well, who would want to rope in dead fish?
3513187	3518509	No, you rope them in while they're alive and kicking, and then they die when they're sitting in a styrofoam container.
3518829	3521490	No, all the radiation in the water killed them.
3522291	3522631	Kidding?
3522691	3523131	I'm kidding.
3523151	3523791	Gosh, gosh.
3523831	3524632	All right, let's move on.
3524652	3525672	That's very insensitive of you.
3525692	3528253	I am completely insensitive, but all right, let's move on.
3530234	3552789	Dream Trigger 3D for 3DS Fear 3 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360 Get Fit with Mel B, Who Cares Gods and Heroes, Rome Rising Let's Dance with Mel B, Who Else Cares Shadows of the Damned Call of Duty Black Ops Annihilation Pack Sorry, that was the 28th, my bad.
3553349	3553549	Done.
3555511	3556672	Alright, it's a quick week.
3557745	3558846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3575720	3576240	All right, moving on.
3591105	3617751	and good luck for both of them because both lawsuits in either direction were approved so the lawsuit filed against Activision by Infinity Ward is moving forward and I guess that the claims have merit also apparently the judge has allowed the countersuit to move forward as well so it'll be interesting to see how that pans out
3618812	3626817	And then, since we're talking about Activision here, and everybody loves Bobby Kotick, Bobby Kotick actually has... They do?
3627898	3628799	No, I'm being sarcastic.
3629359	3630600	Sarcasm, it's fun.
3632041	3645630	Bobby Kotick actually has a cameo as, I guess, a manager of a baseball team in Moneyball, the new Brad Pitt movie about the Oakland A's.
3648598	3650459	Wait, wait, they made a movie about the Oakland A's?
3650699	3652540	Yeah Why?
3653620	3662665	Because there was this coach that came in and changed the way they do drafting or whatever and it was a big deal Why don't they make a movie about a good baseball team?
3662685	3664406	Why don't they make a movie about the Giants?
3666607	3677232	Field of Dreams A League of Their Own I'd be more interested in seeing A League of Their Own again and watching a movie about the Oakland A's
3681001	3682863	Moving on, one more story for you guys.
3682963	3685745	And this has been all over the press this week.
3685785	3686806	I'm sure you guys have heard.
3687207	3689909	But some of your favorite gaming websites were hacked.
3690289	3690690	That's right.
3690710	3693012	Bethesda was hacked earlier this week.
3693212	3700078	And yeah, Bethesda apparently had 200,000 user accounts compromised there.
3700198	3703901	So yeah, be careful if you were a member of Bethesda's forums.
3704321	3710207	Also, the same hackers took down Minecraft, EVE Online, and The Escapist Magazine.
3710227	3715091	A lot of this was from denial-of-service attacks, a very popular way to bring down websites out there.
3715992	3720676	EVE Online was taken offline for several hours, as was The Escapist Magazine Online.
3720716	3723819	I think Minecraft was down for a little bit, but they came back up pretty quick.
3725839	3730981	Good rule of thumb here, the same hacker group released I think like 62,000 login and passwords.
3732761	3742103	Don't use the same password on Bethesda's website or Square Enix's forums or whatever gaming forums you log into.
3742503	3745364	Don't use the same password there that you use on PayPal.
3746324	3750927	This is a real chance for you to evaluate the passwords that you use.
3751147	3755989	And we kind of throw this out there as a warning to those out there that don't want to end up in the same boat.
3757070	3763393	Because you know what we say on the show, I'm not condoning what these guys are doing, but you know the old saying, hackers are going to hack.
3763953	3769456	And for whatever the reason, whether it be they're trying to make a point or trying to steal money or whatever it is.
3769816	3772778	So just make sure you don't use the same password.
3773718	3778240	for your banking that you do on the Orange Challenge Radio forums even.
3778320	3786943	Because I'll tell you what, PHPBB is what we use and what a lot of different websites use.
3787784	3789484	Those things I'm sure can get hacked pretty easy.
3789824	3794766	So don't use the same password on anything like that that you would use for your bank or your PayPal.
3795166	3795927	Have different passwords.
3797387	3799008	This public service announcement brought to you by us.
3800154	3800374	Yes.
3800754	3801635	Alright, moving on.
3801715	3804656	Let's get into some classic gaming.
3804696	3806357	We're going to take a stroll down memory lane.
3807297	3814400	DarkSakura has picked a classic game, or games as the case may be tonight, that she's going to highlight as the classic game of the week.
3814440	3819962	It's the one and only true love for this week in gaming.
3820362	3822803	DarkSakura, what should the kids out there be playing this week?
3823203	3823764	Contra.
3824504	3826024	I selected the Contra series.
3826044	3829686	Right, because I think you did the Contra game a while ago, but now we've got the whole damn series.
3830496	3832900	I don't remember doing Contra, but okay.
3833440	3838126	So yeah, basically, the series started in 1987.
3838307	3847258	It's a run-and-gun style shooter, and it came out as Contra, and then we had the release Super Contra in 1988, and a bunch of other Contras.
3848199	3863308	and now this is actually just my old Japanese studies that makes me pretty giddy is that it was in Japanese it was written out in Ateji which is like using the kanji but for their pronunciation
3864669	3866870	I thought that was pretty interesting.
3869031	3875854	And it actually, the first one came out after, the arcade one, came out after the Iran-Contra affair.
3876354	3878755	And people were like, well, is this about that?
3879755	3881216	And there was an ending theme.
3881596	3882796	It was called Sandinista.
3882816	3884317	I don't know if anyone remembers that.
3884877	3900727	The original is side-scrolling, but you've got a few 3D view areas, is what they were called, where it's behind you.
3900747	3904890	And then a couple of overhead ones, like in Super Contra and Contra 3 The Alien Wars.
3906051	3906151	Um...
3907848	3909110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3925859	3934124	and then basically they were all two player except for the MSX2 version of Contra and Operation C for the Game Boy.
3934144	3935305	Those were only single player.
3936726	3949234	So you get different weapons and you can replace your regular gun with a laser gun or a spread gun, rapid bullets, they increase your fire speed.
3949274	3954177	You can also get the Mega Shell in Super Contra or Bombs in Contra 3 and Contra Hardcorp.
3955657	3956958	So there's all kinds of neat stuff.
3957058	3960699	But the biggest thing about Contra is that it was hard.
3961619	3964981	And for the record, the NES version of Contra does use the Konami code.
3965161	3966761	It gives you 30 lives instead of 3.
3967822	3971543	Probably the most infamous game to use the Konami code because you couldn't really beat it without it.
3974572	3983355	Most of the other ones had the extra lives codes in the Japanese releases, such as Contra Spirits, which was Contra 3 over here, and Contra Hardcore.
3984136	3985176	So, the games in the series.
3985216	3990958	We have Contra, which is on Arcade, NES, MSX2, DOS, C64, CPC, ZX.
3991939	3995360	And then Super Contra, Arcade, NES, DOS, and Amiga.
3996561	3997801	Operation Sea on Game Boy.
3997881	4001383	Contra 3 The Alien Wars, which was SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance.
4002383	4013366	Contra Force on the NES, Contra Hardcore which was on Genesis slash Mega Drive, Contra Legacy of War on PlayStation and Saturn which I think we have the Saturn one of that I want to say.
4014506	4021108	See the Contra Adventure on PlayStation, Contra Shattered Soldier on PS2, Neo Contra on PS2, Contra 4 on Nintendo DS.
4022128	4023949	That was done by WayForward Technology.
4024869	4033895	and it actually had two screens that, you know, because it was a DS you had different kinds of views that you could use.
4033955	4047804	There was Contra Rebirth that was done by M2 for WiiWare and Hardcore Uprising which is on PS3, Xbox 360 and that's a downloadable title released this year.
4048024	4052087	There were re-releases of Contra and Super Contra and
4053584	4054767	There were DOS ports.
4054787	4057573	There was the outstretched CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum.
4058494	4060398	And in Europe, it came out as Gryzor.
4062711	4062971	Sorry.
4065353	4069035	They're actually mobile phone versions to Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade.
4069955	4077219	As far as cancelled games, there was Contra Spirit 64, which was in development by Konami of Osaka.
4078340	4082362	However, it was cancelled when the development team disbanded.
4083363	4084763	That was being worked on in 1998.
4084823	4085264	For other ones...
4088105	4091387	I love this game, Konami YY World, which is on Famicom.
4092507	4100391	It actually had the same boss theme that was used in the original Contra and it came out right before Contra.
4101491	4107934	YY World 2, SOS, Parsley Joe, Bill Riser is a playable character in there, Snatcher.
4111170	4119318	The two characters, Bill and Lance, go to a Konami-themed party held at the Outer Heaven show pub.
4120399	4128147	They are replaced by Light and Pastel from Twinbee, but in the 32-bit version of the game, there's a Contra ad in there.
4128167	4131310	There's a nanobraker, Jaguar from Neo Contra, as a hidden character.
4131930	4136352	Best Student Council, which is a TV anime produced by Konami.
4137933	4141435	There's a character called Lance Bean, who is not a Contra character.
4144216	4145737	Palopuro-kun Pocket 8 is...
4149291	4151353	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4175610	4203353	so yeah these were all set in the 27th century the initial Contra and the sequels had Bill Reiser and Lance Bean who were modeled after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and then they were named after actors that were in Aliens as in Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser so and then Lance Henriksen and Michael Bean for Lance Bean so I thought that was neat
4204494	4219811	and then after that it sort of deviated and had different people and then Contra Shattered Soldier brought back Bill Reiser who was a war criminal and then Neo Contra also had him in there too but it was a clone oh well spoilers
4221952	4236159	As far as differences in the different versions, there were some changes in between the Japanese and US ones, mostly in character naming and who the character is supposed to be.
4239332	4252601	There were also different bad guys, like the Red Falcon was actually the Tenoki Gaba, was what his name was, the Emperor Demon Gaba.
4253482	4258425	And then there was Mad Dog and Scorpion were given to Bill and Lance in the NES versions.
4260727	4286047	when it came out in Europe and Australia it was called Probotector and they were robots so they weren't Bill and Lance and then different versions came out as I said earlier as Grisor and then Super Protector, Alien Rebels which is Contra 3, The Alien Wars for Game Boy they were also put out as Probotector
4287308	4295099	and then the Wii versions were released as Probotector in the UK.
4296280	4303510	Contra 4 did not get released in Europe, but Probotector was in the game as a hidden character.
4304050	4304471	So that's it.
4306001	4307262	Good lord, that's a lot of Contra.
4308002	4308303	Yeah.
4308823	4309643	But it's a great series.
4309784	4310324	Hard as hell.
4310844	4311525	No, serious.
4311565	4313826	But very rewarding if you can actually make your way through the games.
4314687	4315227	Seriously.
4315748	4315968	All right.
4316188	4322532	We're going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid-fire news.
4322592	4328336	Your Twitter topics, so get those in twitter.com slash OLR if you have something you want us to talk about or any questions for us tonight.
4328356	4330978	We're going to talk about Kinect making its way to the PC.
4330998	4334680	We're going to talk a little more about that Silent Hill collection that was announced at E3.
4334740	4335921	Some more details coming out on that.
4336382	4339006	and Nintendo Stance on free-to-play games.
4339506	4344274	We'll talk a little more about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4350023	4352464	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4352524	4358145	We are live with episode number 416 of our show on this June 19th, 2011.
4358485	4359926	You know what next week is.
4360306	4365607	It's going to be June 26th, 2011, and that's the closest show to our ninth birthday as a station.
4366508	4369028	June 23rd, or I should say as a show.
4369128	4372449	We used to have a station on Life is Five, but then, of course, we folded that a few years ago.
4372709	4374490	Hence our new home at All Games, which we like.
4375270	4378273	So yeah, that is all going to be next week.
4378613	4380095	Not doing anything special, guys.
4380175	4386920	Nine's like a weird number, and we thought maybe it would be better to save something really cool for 10 years.
4387001	4389082	We should open up with Rumstein.
4389242	4395408	We're hoping we can get a guest or something to come in and have fun with us, but we're not really planning on anything super huge.
4395548	4399411	There just comes a point where celebrating too much is just too much.
4399511	4401233	Like, okay, we had a five-year show.
4401553	4404455	We had a 300, a 400, you know, nine years, whatever.
4404655	4405476	So that's that.
4406776	4408918	So we'll be here next week, of course, with that.
4409098	4418103	If you wanted to wish us happy birthday, a great way to do that, of course, would be to rate us on iTunes with a five-star review because that helps other people notice the show or just spread the word.
4418143	4420225	We always say at the end of the show, spread the word about the show.
4420545	4421065	Send a tweet.
4421125	4426108	I saw somebody made a very nice Facebook post this week pointing us to the Orange Launch Radio Facebook.
4426389	4427049	I thought that was great.
4427149	4429310	So all that stuff always really helps.
4429331	4429851	It goes a long way.
4430505	4435807	During the break, Loki was asking me about why didn't I mention Child of Eden during my gaming week?
4435887	4448252	Because I've made it no secret on the show before, I'm a huge fan of Q and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, obviously the Reds, Space Channel, Luminous, shit, I even loved Every Extent Extra Extreme.
4448852	4453654	I still say 99 Nights wasn't as bad as y'all made it out to be, but maybe that's a little bit of fanboyism there.
4453894	4477143	but I did not play Child of Eden this week long story short I was basically reminded that I had a birthday coming up and maybe I shouldn't make any game purchases until my birthday has passed for those that don't know my birthday happens to also be next Sunday my birthday was three days after the original OLR on June 23rd so yeah my birthday is right around this time too so I have to wait until then and then you know maybe there'll be a gift card or something I can use to go get it
4477683	4478704	They said it will bring you to tears.
4501593	4502594	It will bring you to tears.
4502814	4505476	Well, the original Rez was an amazing game, too.
4505716	4507357	And it was probably only about 90 minutes.
4507858	4510139	Now, granted, games didn't cost 60 bucks back then.
4510199	4516244	The only thing that brings me to tears is the fact that I forgot to send in Josh's picture when they were doing picture submissions.
4516264	4518425	Because that would have been awesome.
4518485	4519266	I forgot that was there.
4520006	4524790	So I've been trying to stay spoiler-free, so please don't spoil or whatever.
4524870	4525010	But
4526051	4528492	Loki and I were kind of talking a little bit about the whole 90 minutes thing.
4528712	4541441	And Loki, you feel that 90 minutes, paying $60 for a 90-minute experience is okay, which is funny to hear from you because usually you're the first one to dog people that are wanting to kind of price gouge and all that stuff.
4541481	4545684	But if it's a damn good 90 minutes, then it might be worth the cost, right?
4545904	4546404	Exactly.
4546464	4549426	I mean, the way I look at it is like shooters.
4549486	4553569	I mean, shooters that are out there, I'm not talking about first-person shooters.
4553589	4555070	I'm talking about arcade games.
4555671	4557434	They're not 30 hours long.
4557575	4560440	They're like a few hours, if that.
4561142	4563967	I mean, it's a full fleshed out game.
4563987	4564248	I mean...
4565717	4568239	You don't need a whole lot of story with this stuff.
4569880	4573762	You don't need to spend extra time for story development and whatnot.
4573822	4581147	But if it's a good, entertaining 90 minutes, it's better than a boring 6 hours or a boring 30 hours.
4582308	4584889	I mean, you might spend $60 to go to an awesome concert.
4585870	4589652	I probably spent over $100 to go see Lady Gaga.
4590713	4592094	And that was a pretty awesome 90 minutes.
4592134	4592314	Yeah.
4593935	4599056	But all joking aside, obviously reviewers are going to react differently and so forth.
4599076	4600577	But see, that's the thing.
4600637	4602537	That's my problem with some of these reviewers nowadays.
4602597	4608539	It's like they kind of forgot how games were or they forgot how things are.
4609259	4612080	They're like, oh, this isn't as good as Call of Duty, so I don't like it.
4612960	4613901	I don't understand that.
4613961	4618302	Let me play devil's advocate a little bit here, though, is that the game marketplace isn't what it used to be.
4618662	4622703	And to be fair, there's a lot of games out there that have intense replayability value.
4623163	4623583	DarkSakura.com
4640237	4641638	No, it's not a first-person shooter.
4641658	4642399	That's different.
4642519	4644700	Oh, okay.
4644840	4647702	You can judge first-person shooters against other first-person shooters.
4648223	4650584	And granted, you can judge different elements of it.
4650624	4654607	Like, okay, this has good production value and stuff like that.
4655728	4668336	But you can't say, oh, because this shooter slash music game is not as long as Final Fantasy XIII, well, I'm going to have to rate it lower or something.
4668356	4669277	Okay.
4669417	4670178	Thanks for watching!
4689298	4694841	and find the reviewers that are sharing your same dislikes or likes with these games.
4694881	4700183	And when you find a reviewer that kind of thinks like you do, then you'll know whether to trust that person's opinion or not.
4700583	4704005	Because at the end of the day, an IGN review, that's one person's opinion.
4704145	4709367	That's one person's opinion that you're holding so much weight against because it's IGN.com.
4709647	4710347	It's one dude.
4710528	4713369	I mean, hell, if I said I hate this game, I hate Madden.
4713969	4714510	Thanks for watching!
4731621	4732602	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4754012	4778076	and so a lot of times it seems like that that comes out it's not a unbiased opinion and sometimes I think that they just dog on a game so badly because it's funny and people will you know link to that article to get some pages just because you know such as the websites that gave Duke Nukem Forever a zero like you know I again I haven't played Duke Nukem Forever but a zero like I
4778556	4792144	I don't think I can trust a website that gave Fusion Frenzy 2 a higher score than Duke Nukem Forever.
4792444	4796587	Because Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst game I've played this generation.
4796907	4802610	And also, once again, like I said, it's all about whether... Bomberman Zero.
4802710	4803251	I take that back.
4803291	4805052	Bomberman Zero is the worst game I've played this generation.
4806394	4809938	It's all about whether you agree with the person that's reviewing stuff.
4809958	4813623	There are certain video movie reviewers out there that you may have.
4813983	4820631	You may share the same opinion with Roger Ebert as opposed to some other guy or vice versa.
4821332	4825597	It's all about finding the reviewer that makes sense to you.
4825997	4854186	or or what you can do is instead of worrying about wasting a lot of money you know what guess what you can go now to Redbox Machines and you can rent a game for two dollars for a night so you know what you can get a taste of the game or you can play a demo or you can rent it at a you know traditional video rental place or you can do it through Gamefly or wherever and you don't spend you know sixty dollars on a game you can check it out and if you like it cool you buy it if not then you didn't waste that much money
4854431	4858856	Let me go to some comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we are taping live on this Sunday night.
4859176	4863081	Breakman in our chatroom says, For 90 minutes of fun, a hooker would charge you a lot more money.
4863141	4864422	So this is actually a good deal.
4865123	4866104	Speaking of Child of Eden.
4866124	4866465	That's right.
4866485	4868747	I did learn that from watching Cat House Girls.
4869088	4875175	It was that Air Force Amy, or whatever her name was, would charge probably several hundred dollars for 90 minutes of fun.
4876740	4886049	I have a feeling that the people in that cat house charge a lot more than your traditional hooker because they're in Vegas and shit.
4886129	4887510	No, that was the Bunny Ranch.
4887590	4889492	That's up past Reno.
4889752	4890693	Oh, my mistake.
4890713	4891914	Well, it's still Nevada.
4891974	4893635	They figure people gambling have a lot of money.
4893755	4895677	Loki, we could drive to the Bunny Ranch.
4897178	4900101	We should take your wife out to the Bunny Ranch someday.
4902183	4909231	One of her aspirations in life was to get a prostitution license at some point for Nevada.
4909271	4911353	Just to frame it and put it, you know.
4911373	4911714	So, you know.
4919241	4923225	and to read Saddam Hussein's romance novels that he wrote.
4924727	4927089	Those are two of her aspirations.
4927549	4929111	I think your wife needs a podcast.
4929311	4933596	Not about games, but I think your wife just needs a podcast called Nelly's Dreams.
4934116	4936178	And every week she could talk about a dream of hers.
4937279	4941363	Well, a lot of the stuff that we talk about ends up on Facebook anyway, especially if we say something funny.
4941663	4947068	Like last night, I was saying something to her, and to her, a lot of the stuff I say sounds like mumbling.
4947468	4948709	And so she'll say, you said this?
4949009	4953213	Or, you know, it's usually something ridiculous.
4954634	4955715	You called me an N-word?
4956115	4957637	No, that's not what I said at all.
4959684	4963388	I don't even remember what the hell I actually said It was not even close
4974977	4975938	Comic Insanity.
4976618	4982143	We have a podcast up every Tuesday on Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
4982883	4985265	And we talk comics and other geeky stuff.
4986426	4986947	So tune in.
4987227	4989789	It's me and Tiara and Dan Jetto.
4991109	5020949	and I saw some of you in chat saying that I'm dogging on Warcraft which I don't think I am really but then on the other token I turn around and I play World of Warcraft which isn't for everyone and that's fine I understand that game isn't for everyone but if you think it might be for you or it is for you you should check out the best little horde house in Azeroth hordehouse.com that's the show I do with Extifer about the World of Warcraft it's put out every week except last week because I was doing double duty here for E3 but we did come back with episode 29 this week and it was a lot of fun
5021249	5025134	Talking about the upcoming patch that still has not come out.
5025695	5027798	That may not come out on Tuesday after all.
5028198	5031202	So lots of WoW stuff and Warcraft discussion going on there.
5031242	5032644	HordeHouse.com
5033134	5035476	All right, let's move on and get into some rapid fire news.
5035856	5037938	Lots of new gaming stories throughout the week.
5037978	5040019	We don't always have time to spend five minutes on all of them.
5040340	5042761	Let's talk quickly about some of the things you might otherwise miss.
5042942	5043202	Loki.
5043522	5044903	So EA is trying something out.
5045003	5051068	They decided to open a retail store for EA Sports in the Charlotte Airport.
5051668	5054431	And of course, you know, if you've been to airports, they have a lot of...
5055111	5055471	and many more.
5072382	5081593	So, they're going to be doing that, and I guess kind of as a test to see if this is something that would take off other places.
5082354	5082954	I don't know.
5083115	5091404	It's a neat idea, but I don't think you're going to see this really anywhere else because, you know, everybody carries EA Sports stuff, so... I don't know.
5091484	5091865	But, I mean...
5093566	5096607	Those theme type stores are pretty popular in airports.
5097808	5098168	Makes sense.
5099768	5100889	Now this is kind of interesting.
5101269	5103349	Never thought I would see a sequel to this game.
5103710	5106891	But apparently Namco is doing a new Namco Generations game.
5107491	5109211	And that game is Dancing Eyes.
5109331	5111412	And Dancing Eyes was an arcade game.
5112052	5113193	It came out I think in the 2000s.
5114273	5114914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5130547	5144718	And as you connected the dots or connected the lines around a shape, that shape would disappear and reveal either the scantily clad woman underneath or, in some cases, a cow or a person or who knows.
5144778	5145159	Titties?
5146240	5149002	No, there was no nudity in any of these games.
5149062	5151844	But after you did get done, though, they played the kind of...
5156010	5156611	Burlesque
5165504	5169708	So they're going to be putting out a new game now for the Namco Generations.
5169888	5171469	You used to play this game in Arcade Infinity.
5171689	5176713	Actually, I did play this, and I actually have it on my arcade cabinet at home.
5176833	5178655	I've played it in MAME, and it's fun.
5179516	5184340	It's not, you know, it's not an adult game.
5184380	5187182	I mean, it sort of could... I guess it's... It's PG-13.
5187202	5187482	Yeah, I mean...
5189964	5196066	You reveal women wearing bikinis or a girl dressed up like a cat.
5196126	5197646	You know, a cat girl or something.
5197666	5199387	Oh my gosh, not a cat girl.
5199427	5207669	You're playing as a monkey and you run around and you're trying to avoid different enemies that are running around the screen.
5207689	5209410	So you're supposed to dodge them.
5210230	5211631	They actually have some screenshots here.
5211991	5218953	It's basically just running around like a woman's shirt and it's revealing her bra underneath.
5218973	5219013	So...
5220154	5221278	That's coming out on PlayStation 3.
5222583	5224409	Oh, 96 is when it came out in the arcade.
5224790	5225031	That was 2000.
5227543	5227803	Neat.
5228364	5238252	Also, they're going to be doing a game or a new version of Metro Cross as Arrow Cross, I guess.
5239713	5241155	So that's kind of neat.
5241755	5253005	And then finally, I guess this is good news for people that are looking for a new Psychonauts game, but Double Fine is now obtaining the rights to publish a new Psychonauts game.
5254802	5271236	and of course it came out back in 2005 and Tim Schafer says Double Fine has always owned the intellectual property rights for Psychonauts franchise so we've been free to pursue movies, sequels, etc.
5271816	5278922	What's changed recently is the publishing rights to the game Psychonauts have reverted to Double Fine and some of the deals still need to be finalized.
5279063	5280684	This means anything financially.
5281144	5282846	When that happens we'll have more to announce.
5285693	5286013	All right.
5286273	5286414	Neat.
5287274	5293677	Well, moving on to Xbox Live, you might have caught the indie games uprising last winter.
5294137	5297338	It was a way for the indie games on Xbox Live to get more exposure.
5297378	5302060	In fact, there was a little bit of back and forth because it was something that the community kind of came up with.
5302120	5306402	And Microsoft at first didn't really support it, but they finally came around and they did kind of give it some support.
5307383	5309344	and so forth calling attention to it.
5330976	5334199	So this will be a way to get visibility for some of those games.
5334499	5335479	So we'll see what happens there.
5336120	5344646	Submissions, if you are an indie developer, you know an indie developer that might want to get in on this, you can submit through June 24th.
5344907	5346668	So that's not very much more time.
5346728	5347529	So you might want to get on that.
5348729	5355972	Moving on, speaking of Xbox, one of the big things that was shown at the Microsoft press conference this year was the Fable The Journey demonstration.
5356893	5361235	Well, a very interesting quote from Peter Molyneux this week about it.
5362235	5366477	This was in an interview with official Xbox magazine, quote,
5367337	5368977	A horrendous mistake, and...
5392442	5406088	I have to agree, they made a huge mistake not showing that you could navigate it did look like rails so they should have said something about that but who knows, we'll see more about this when it gets a little closer to release
5408030	5411653	By the way, the reason why they did what they did, they wanted to showcase the game's action.
5412274	5415456	Like using the magic attacks and the whole horse and carriage and all that stuff.
5416197	5419200	And because the non-Unrails part wasn't finished yet.
5420020	5425425	One of the other big pieces to come out of E3 was that you're going to get a free game if you have a 3DS.
5425765	5429068	You're going to get the Four Swords, The Legend of Zelda Four Swords.
5429529	5432611	That is going to be coming out for free a little later this year.
5432671	5434373	It's supposed to be out in September.
5434813	5435893	According to Nintendo.
5436234	5441855	Well, just to clarify, it did come out this week that the version you're going to be getting is the Game Boy Advance version.
5442255	5446557	Because there's no real way to do the GameCube emulation, I'm assuming on the 3DS right now.
5446917	5451318	The Game Boy Advance version is the version that you will be able to get on the 3DS.
5451798	5456500	No word yet about if it's going to be enhanced at all, kind of like Excitebike had...
5457040	5460081	Very minimal thrills to kind of enhance it for widescreen and so forth.
5460461	5466162	No word if that's going to be given the same treatment for Zelda Four Swords or possibly even maybe online.
5466943	5468223	That might just be wishful thinking.
5468343	5468783	I don't know.
5468863	5472464	But it is the Game Boy Advance version that you're going to get for free later this year.
5472504	5475865	And I guess free is not such a bad deal unless it's yours.
5476636	5478397	DarkSakura, you have some rapid fire stuff for us?
5478838	5479118	I do.
5480579	5483241	For Portal 2, there's some download content coming out.
5483261	5488465	This is the Sixth Sense Motion Pack, but it only works with the Razer Hydra Motion Controller.
5489586	5491928	You can actually get the pack, of course, through Steam.
5492028	5494270	You can get the controller through Steam as well, and it's $140.
5494951	5498553	But it comes with a copy of Portal 2 and a download content.
5499534	5502997	Of course, if you already have Portal 2, then you have a gift for a friend.
5504463	5505744	Super Mario Bros.
5505764	5506805	3 Fan Remake Super Mario Bros.
5506825	5507846	3 Fan Remake Super Mario Bros.
5507866	5508927	3 Fan Remake Super Mario Bros.
5508947	5510448	3 Fan Remake
5531945	5557508	I actually watched some of the video and it does look really nice by the way Sony is offering 6 months of Curiosity for PS3 owners basically you sign up for their little demo of the service and you can get a music unlimited option and then you can listen to whatever songs you want to pretty cool
5557830	5561771	That is pretty cool as long as it doesn't roll into a subscription or something like that.
5563292	5565452	Well, that you'd have to check the site.
5565652	5576695	I know they were very careful about PlayStation Plus where they did go out of their way to say once the 30-day trial is up in the Welcome Back program, once the 30-day trial is up, you will not be charged at all.
5576755	5579916	I'm actually trying to get it.
5579936	5586538	I have to download my games and stuff, but right now we don't have... Remember, my PS3 doesn't have wireless internet.
5586658	5589181	Keep in mind you only have until July something to do.
5589201	5589582	I know that.
5589682	5590363	It's July 3rd.
5592105	5593006	I'm probably going to do it this week.
5593427	5597692	I have to drag an Ethernet cable out to the front room.
5597752	5599555	It's not very fun.
5600615	5602937	All right, let's get to the Twitter topics.
5603277	5607700	Before I get there, I've actually been purposely waiting on the PlayStation Plus.
5608060	5623129	I'm waiting until right before the last day because if it is a 30-day trial, either something's got to come out real soon that makes me want to get it now to get the discount or whatever, or I'm going to wait and see if they maybe start putting on some real good stuff after it's not free anymore.
5623149	5624030	You know what I mean?
5624070	5626131	For most people that went in and jumped in day one.
5626191	5626571	We'll see.
5626772	5627092	I don't know.
5627672	5628633	Maybe it'll pay off, maybe not.
5629304	5630885	Let's move into some Twitter topics.
5630925	5632706	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5632807	5635689	Every week you show us your tweets and we read them here on air.
5635769	5636069	Why?
5636729	5638391	Because we're the show where every gamer has a voice.
5638971	5641393	JV Mon sent us a string of tweets to start us off today.
5642413	5646096	Basically he went to Nintendo World and said there's a huge line for Zelda.
5646156	5647677	I didn't even realize they were showing that today.
5647997	5648538	But they were.
5648658	5649739	Of course this is New York City.
5650059	5653822	He says it easily goes down at least a block and a half before they start letting people in.
5654682	5656103	and even sent a little picture.
5656183	5662325	I guess these are people like going into the store because from this picture, it doesn't look very long, but the line's going like the other way.
5662785	5665086	But yeah, it looks like there are huge crowds out there today.
5665406	5670087	And he says, the one time I forgot the 3DS at home, like everyone has them.
5670287	5673268	You get a street pass with like 100 people over at that event.
5673669	5674029	Crazy.
5675530	5675890	Let's see.
5676070	5677551	Also, some other tweets.
5678112	5682516	Warrior Bob had tweeted, I just realized I've been listening to OLR for like seven years.
5682976	5683597	Holy carp.
5684297	5685959	Yeah, some of our listeners have been listening a long time.
5686019	5688000	So thank you to all of you, of course, the listeners.
5688761	5690082	We wouldn't be here if it weren't for your support.
5690122	5696388	Whether you just started listening this week or you've been there since episode one, which would be very few of you because I think we had 12 people listening that week.
5696808	5700712	But thank you to you guys who've supported us from whatever time over the years.
5701532	5704814	Defective Candy sent us a tweet with a story from CNN.
5705434	5707715	Average age of a gamer goes up.
5709276	5715198	And CNN had reported here, I guess they were reporting about this 37-year-old.
5716199	5720121	Now that I'm going to be 33 pretty soon, 37 does not seem that old at all.
5720461	5720821	In a row.
5721481	5725163	So I'm just kind of surprised they're talking about this whole thing like gamers are getting older.
5725985	5755149	I think just a lot of us grew up on games and haven't stopped because we just accepted as a part of our lives whereas I think back when the original Nintendo came out maybe 37 year olds at the time didn't get it quote unquote so I don't know but anyway they were talking about this whole thing about how gamers are getting older blah blah blah blockbuster games the social games and so on and so on yeah gamers are getting older because I think they just haven't left stuck with them
5756691	5761772	Dark Tetsuya says that he is plugging his first round of Where Are They Now interviews.
5762232	5764873	I guess some of the people, he's mentioned some of the people he's going to be interviewing.
5765233	5768174	Jessica Harper is going to be in one of the Where Are They Now interviews.
5768594	5774796	Vertu, who you might remember, he was the guy that was famous for passing Max 300 back in the day.
5775276	5775836	And Rice.
5776576	5777156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5802874	5803635	We know where she is.
5803695	5809098	Yeah, Jessica Harper, of course, is on Saturday nights on All Games Radio on her own show with Travis Donovan.
5809219	5810239	Why aren't you guys listening?
5810359	5810720	That's right.
5811100	5815703	So, yeah, I could tell you where she is now, but I'm sure there'll be some other little tidbits in there.
5816063	5823528	Maybe she'll talk about how it was to have DDR Freak and Orange Lounge Radio kind of coexisting because it was an interesting history.
5823569	5825470	We talked about it when she was here for the first time on the show.
5825750	5828392	If you didn't listen, you'll just have to go find that episode now.
5829244	5830165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5846616	5861333	Electronic Arts had a gun in the Godfather games called the Dillinger, and back in 2009, the grandson of Dillinger's half-sister threatened to sue EA unless they paid him millions of dollars.
5862114	5863395	Wow, that's kind of sad.
5863795	5869138	Well, a judge in Indiana this week said that the Dillinger descendant is not entitled to any money.
5869478	5872399	There is an Indiana law regarding a person's publicity right.
5872659	5875020	It was enacted after Dillinger died.
5875120	5875801	So, sorry.
5876421	5879282	Totally sounds like a cash grab thing against a big corporation.
5879322	5881023	And he got basically laughed out of court.
5881444	5882704	Everybody point and laugh.
5883064	5883985	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
5886003	5887525	Tiger Claw links us one more story.
5887965	5893149	Miyamoto has said that virtual boy games on the 3DS, it could happen.
5894070	5895712	I guess wherever there's money to be made, right?
5895992	5903598	It was in an interview with GameSpot saying, quote from Miyamoto, well, that's not my exact plan, but something like that could happen.
5903999	5909043	I can say that in my photo album on my Nintendo 3DS, there is a photo of a virtual boy.
5909403	5912306	So that says I do have a virtual boy at my disposal.
5912746	5913067	Laughs.
5913707	5917852	Only 14 games were ever released in the West Virtual Boy Color
5930666	5931826	Yeah.
5931886	5935027	It'd be nice to see them redone in color, not red.
5935327	5937567	I think it would be neat to see them redo that, but we'll see.
5937847	5940368	And hopefully this time they won't give us migraines.
5941088	5941608	But we'll see.
5942008	5942708	That was the worst.
5943088	5943829	Yeah, we'll see.
5944769	5946329	That does it for the Twitter topics tonight.
5946369	5947989	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5948049	5949470	Say hi to us throughout the week.
5949870	5953610	More news stories, mailbag soon, Skype line after that.
5953991	5956311	We still have plenty more to cover, so let's go to Loki.
5957182	5958063	Ah, yes.
5958383	5966327	So, apparently, the long-talked-about Kinect for Windows software development kit has finally been released.
5966808	5968149	At least, the beta has.
5969029	5974893	And, of course, they have the versions available for 32-bit and 64-bit.
5974993	5978375	It requires Windows 7, and I guess it's for non-commercial use.
5978435	5979515	So, right now, you can...
5980896	5988261	Homebrew developers can make their own Kinect hacks or whatever and show them off.
5989001	5998068	One way you may be able to show them off is actually in this new vote for the next Kinect hack to become a Kinect Fun Labs toy.
5998788	6002270	They have voting up right now for a few different...
6003431	6005914	Hacks, six well-known ones, I guess.
6006915	6009718	The apps in question, Keyboard Anywhere.
6010139	6017807	It's basically like the keyboard from Big, the floor keyboard where you can play just by stepping around the ground.
6018688	6020269	Virtual Conductor Connect Body Art
6037841	6040142	Hand Puppets was shown off.
6041562	6047205	They had like a bird hand puppet that was being projected onto the wall that someone was manipulating with their arm.
6047666	6051567	And when the camera saw you move your hand, it would move the puppet as well.
6051708	6053128	So that was kind of cool.
6053328	6060132	Digital Pin Art, which is like those pin art devices where you can kind of make your hand imprint and stuff like that.
6061032	6061472	They have that.
6061572	6070275	And then Music Visualizer, which would be kind of just like it sounds, something you play music to, and it kind of makes these waveforms appear all throughout your room.
6071095	6073156	So those are all.
6074716	6078397	Right now you can vote on those on ConnectShare.com.
6080498	6081939	Have you played Kinect Fun Labs yet?
6082139	6082239	No.
6082540	6083320	It's so dopey.
6085041	6088144	It's really one of those things that's fun for five minutes and you're like, oh, okay.
6088284	6088784	But it's free.
6089145	6089825	Yeah, it's free.
6089885	6090406	Can't complain.
6090526	6092487	Free achievement points if you're into that sort of thing.
6093108	6099953	But it's really the type of thing I think a bunch of people would get drunk and have a lot of fun making the little mini movies.
6100473	6104676	Like the one I did of the Sailor Moon that was like, I'll kill you and all that stuff.
6104876	6104976	Yeah.
6105797	6106137	I don't know.
6106737	6107718	A lot of it's kind of hokey.
6107738	6109658	I really want that keyboard thing to come out, though.
6109678	6110278	That would look kind of fun.
6110298	6112259	It needs to be longer than 15 seconds.
6113039	6114620	Yeah, they need to let you do more with that.
6116420	6116700	All right.
6117220	6122742	Anyhow, moving on to one of the other announcements out of E3 was that there is a Silent Hill collection coming.
6123702	6129684	Not just a Metal Gear, but a game that's dear to us, the Silent Hill series, is getting an HD collection.
6129744	6130524	But here's the catch.
6130584	6132025	It's only on PlayStation 3.
6132825	6138669	It will only include Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3, but there will be new high-definition graphics.
6138849	6141270	So right now it's a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
6142111	6144372	According to the producer Tom Hewlett, quote,
6147794	6176792	so right now we're just aiming at a Sony exclusive which isn't to say that in the future it won't be available anywhere else but right now it's a Sony exclusive they are looking at a fall 2011 release by the way there is all new voice acting in this game as well it is being directed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and so there's a new actor that's going to be in the series let's see and I think a lot of this is because the other actor James Sunderland
6177472	6179933	Doesn't have such kind things to say about his participation in Silent Hill.
6179953	6180694	That's the name of the character.
6180894	6182515	I'm sorry, the guy who played James Sunderland.
6182535	6183255	Guy Sihi.
6183275	6183936	Guy Sihi.
6184736	6185176	Quote, Yikes.
6207847	6207967	Yikes.
6207987	6210630	So it sounds like we might have the real reason why all new voice acting is coming to the game.
6210790	6210910	Hmm.
6226542	6253821	Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to put out You know, there is the Silent Hill Downpour game coming out soon Which, I don't know, I think the shark might have been jumped on Silent Hill We might kind of be done with it And if we weren't... If this wasn't the nail in the coffin The game's soundtrack, of course, no longer by Akira Yamaoka It's by Dan Licht, who did the music for Dexter The theme song is being written by...
6254541	6256603	and Korn, the metal band.
6257343	6258084	Yes, that's right.
6258244	6260346	Korn is doing the theme song to the game.
6261326	6263308	Hey, remember the 90s, you guys?
6263388	6264289	Weren't they awesome?
6264469	6270954	You know, though, I have to listen to the actual song first because just because it's done by Korn doesn't mean it's going to be terrible.
6271354	6280280	There's a very good likelihood that it's going to be terrible, but there's some artists out there that can do scores that aren't terrible.
6280601	6281682	But then again, this is Korn.
6281742	6282622	Korn's not scoring it.
6282642	6283523	They're just doing the theme song.
6283792	6308979	well if also though if you want to look at versatility I mean Daft Punk did do the entire Tron Legacy soundtrack and it was quite different than their usual stuff true but when that was announced everybody said that's fucking awesome and that makes sense but Korn doing Silent Hills is kind of like do not want like the guy doing uh the guy that did Dexter um the score for Dexter doing the score for this game I don't think it's gonna be that bad I think that would be
6309119	6310000	Yeah, I think that'd be alright.
6310040	6313663	I mean, the reality is Akira Yamaoka is moved on.
6313763	6314663	He's doing something else now.
6314763	6315704	You're not gonna have that.
6315724	6318747	Yeah, he's doing something else, that's for sure.
6320328	6323310	Speaking of Neon Genesis, he's been killing the music game.
6324511	6325872	Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.
6326012	6327353	That's not his big project, though.
6327433	6328975	No, no, no, it's just weird.
6329375	6329595	Yeah.
6331116	6334359	So we'll see what happens with the Korn theme song.
6334559	6336761	Hey, some of you still love your Korn.
6337814	6339895	I'm allergic to corn I love Poe I love Poe Which one?
6339915	6339955	Oh
6365521	6366482	I know, which is like a great song.
6366682	6368424	I was like, oh my god, this game has Poe.
6368705	6369265	This is great.
6370386	6371027	Here's something random.
6371047	6375372	Of course, Alan Wake has probably been in development since 98, but... Here's something random.
6375692	6380057	Almost every CD that I've burned except for my very last one has Trigger Happy Jack on it.
6381659	6383461	Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being?
6383521	6383721	Yeah.
6383941	6384582	That's a great song.
6384602	6385443	Fucking love Poe.
6385983	6386464	However...
6388234	6389115	How about some Nintendo news?
6403496	6404557	How about some Nintendo news?
6433759	6439963	So, they also said that it should be able to handle 60 frames per second with 8 players in both online, offline, 2D, and 3D.
6440684	6441244	It's pretty cool.
6441964	6448369	And then, in addition to that, is Red Flare 3DS.
6449509	6453892	Japan is going to be getting a bright red one with a...
6457454	6483153	and they actually put out some press about that around the E3 time and that it looks like it's going to also with new Wii bundles there's going to be on June 23rd Wii Sports Resort and a Wii Remote Plus in the same color as the console and it should be about 250 bucks or 20,000 yen
6487864	6491186	The Red 3DS looks kind of cool, I gotta say.
6491246	6492186	It's a pretty awesome color.
6492226	6493827	If they'd had that at launch, I would've got that color.
6495028	6496508	Makes me think of an old Famicom.
6497309	6497429	Yep.
6498009	6501071	Although it is weird to me how the top screen doesn't change colors.
6501411	6504292	I mean, I guess it's part of the whole 3D effect thing.
6504332	6509615	I think I read somewhere that they can't change colors because it would harm the 3D effect, but whatever.
6511520	6515649	I can see that because your frame colors are going to affect your perception.
6516371	6521222	That's why I like for some reason like displaying most art is good on a room with a light pink wall.
6522970	6524091	I put a link to the image in the chat room.
6547671	6547951	All right.
6548953	6550274	All right, well, let's move on with some more news.
6550875	6553477	Yeah, it's not too terrible, but anyways.
6554298	6555239	Some other fun stuff here.
6555259	6559144	I'm going to talk a little bit about Nintendo and the Wii U again.
6559724	6567493	And, of course, one of the things that people are asking, because it's somewhat popular to have some free-to-play games on different platforms...
6568313	6575398	Nintendo is not interested in freemium games and saying that it hurts the value of games.
6576699	6585525	That's because I myself am one of the game developers who in the future wants to make efforts so that the value of software will be appreciated by the consumers.
6586125	6594611	Although freemium games can make money through ads and microtransactions, they're expressing concern about destroying the value of the game's software.
6595231	6609462	Once again, I think it's all because they want to sell virtual console games for $5 versus $0.99 that you can get for a great game on some other platforms like Android and the iOS and stuff like that.
6609502	6612964	Not to say that all $0.99 games that come out on those are very good.
6613084	6621590	Speaking of which, I just want to throw out there, there's a big sale going on this weekend for games for $0.99 on iOS, and it's the company Gameloft, which...
6622691	6629193	You know, they're a little, because they kind of rip off games, but they do a pretty decent job from what I understand of ripping off games.
6629213	6631473	So I just bought two of them because all the games are 99 cents right now.
6631813	6635614	I bought Order and Chaos, which is their WoW clone on the phone.
6635654	6640575	And I hear it's definitely not WoW, but for an iPhone, it is kind of impressive.
6640655	6645536	And then Eternal Legacy, which try to guess what it's a clone of just from the little icon.
6645656	6646197	I already know.
6647437	6650217	It's literally, I'll show it to DarkSakura in the bottom right-hand corner there on my phone.
6650918	6652158	I just downloaded it while I'm here.
6652959	6653999	Who does that look like to you?
6654420	6655841	Yeah.
6655881	6656962	Tell the listeners, who does that look like to you?
6656982	6657683	It looks very cloud.
6657803	6659585	Yeah, it's a Final Fantasy VII ripoff.
6662048	6665350	But they're 99 cents, and I hear they're good rip-offs, so we'll see.
6665651	6666671	I'll tell you about those next week.
6667152	6669633	But anyway, sorry to deviate from the story.
6670054	6671395	So what's that mean exactly?
6671415	6680261	Because Ghost Recon Online is a free-played game on PC, and it's going to be on the Wii U. Well, expect it not to be free-to-play.
6680721	6683423	So that's kind of unfortunate.
6683844	6684784	Also, it's very long.
6686005	6688427	It's very far away, so maybe they'll change their mind, but
6690473	6693715	I don't know, it's just Nintendo being Nintendo, whatever.
6694656	6718892	And of course, people were hoping that because the Zelda 25th anniversary is happening right now that maybe Nintendo's going to do something cool like they did with, well, I wouldn't exactly call it cool because all they did was port a fucking Super Nintendo game to the Wii, but they were hoping that there would be some sort of Legend of Zelda anthology or something like that that would come out with all the Zelda games.
6720593	6721613	on a disc or something.
6722353	6730115	And, of course, they said, uh, no, they're not going to do that because they didn't want to do the same thing two years in a row.
6732515	6733715	That was their excuse.
6733875	6735636	They didn't want to do the same thing two years in a row.
6737756	6741697	Uh, Nintendo, you just make it too damn easy.
6741757	6743517	You don't want to do the same thing two years in a row.
6743557	6749078	Like, re-release all these old-ass games and, you know, mark them as new or, I don't know, uh,
6752043	6756144	It wasn't like Mario Galaxy and Mario Galaxy 2 released not too far apart.
6756424	6758845	I mean, that's within two years.
6759925	6761185	How about new Super Mario Bros.
6761486	6762906	Wii and new Super Mario Bros.
6763146	6763446	Mii?
6764066	6766447	Yeah, they don't want to do... I'm kidding, Mii's not a game.
6766507	6767727	No, no, here's what they want to do.
6767747	6774789	They want to release all that shit on a virtual console for the 3DS or something and charge you separately for everything.
6775009	6777570	In my opinion, they kind of already did it back on the GameCube, too.
6778010	6778950	Thank you for watching!
6794756	6795796	They just don't want to do that.
6796396	6797237	They don't want to do it.
6799597	6800577	And you know what they're going to do?
6800877	6802578	I will bet you money.
6803378	6806859	You see, because that wonderful Wii U doesn't play GameCube games.
6807519	6814320	So that means it's time to do some more of those... Virtual console GameCube games.
6814460	6817941	It's more the new PlayMotion games.
6818221	6821222	Remember how they had that for a while where they're going to take old-ass...
6822742	6826263	GameCube Games and straight port them over with Wii controls.
6827163	6828403	Yeah, that's what they're going to do.
6828903	6829564	Good times.
6830024	6839866	Hey, as long as F-Zero is one of those games, because I'm kind of pissed that I didn't hear about a new F-Zero, but I guess it was just dreaming anyway.
6840766	6843086	Alright, moving on to another story.
6843226	6844346	There was an F-Zero 64, right?
6845287	6846667	Yeah, but that's already on Virtual Console.
6846687	6847087	That's been out.
6847107	6847967	Well, you know what they're going to do.
6848007	6849487	They're going to import that shit to the 3DS.
6849608	6850308	Oh my god!
6851528	6851888	Moving on.
6853107	6855589	This was kind of an interesting story from the weekend.
6855630	6858953	It's about Duke Nukem Forever, and it has to do with those negative reviews and so forth.
6859013	6863178	I don't know if you heard about what happened, but on Twitter...
6864690	6875537	This gentleman named James Redner, he is the founder of the Redner Group who was representing 2K Games and was representing some of the games like Duke Nukem Forever and so forth.
6876417	6880520	He actually put a tweet out that said, Too many went far with their reviews.
6880880	6885023	We are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's Venom.
6885423	6887544	He followed it with, Bad scores are fine.
6887924	6890346	Venom filled reviews, that's completely different.
6890786	6894029	He did follow up his, I don't know, he was probably high or drunk when he did it.
6894289	6898453	He deleted the tweets and then apologized saying that he was just acting under emotions.
6898533	6903398	He was just being very emotional and his panties were very bunched and he wrote those tweets in anger.
6903838	6905439	But 2K Games sacked him.
6905900	6913547	They said, 2K Games does not endorse the comments made by Jim Redner and we can confirm that the Redner Group no longer represents our products.
6913807	6916950	That was a very public bitch slapping of that.
6917270	6918210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6935497	6936979	Well, are you going to print a good review?
6937039	6942545	And we've heard these stories about embargoes that are allowed to be lifted only if you give the game a good review.
6942905	6949012	And you can get a sneak peek at this game if you gave such and such game a good review.
6949052	6951114	I mean, it's shady shit that happens.
6951174	6952195	And that's why we tell you
6952796	6962585	You know, a lot of times the reviews that you trust most come from the indie sites that are buying these games themselves and not going through these PR agencies.
6962925	6969791	I'm not knocking all PR agencies because some of them do really great things and they do really help out and get questions answered and so forth.
6969811	6973614	But unfortunately, there's a lot of shady shit that happens out there.
6973794	6976076	And if you don't think this happens on a...
6976897	6977477	DarkSakura.com
7005587	7007188	So, they each got one.
7007508	7012450	So, what you do in that kind of case is you just start, you know, you quote them as the source.
7012630	7014671	I know, you just quote them as the source.
7014691	7017532	But then it's like, you know, you're sending people back to the big websites.
7017892	7019592	How's anybody supposed to start a new website?
7019613	7020193	Not necessarily.
7020233	7028036	Like, for example, there was a story I read this week that went back about three different websites and people kept quoting the one that was quoting the other one that was quoting the other one.
7028656	7030477	So, you know, you can do that.
7031557	7031837	All right.
7032778	7033839	Let's get to the mailbag.
7033959	7036360	Every week at Orange Lounge Radio, we welcome your emails.
7036460	7039683	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7039703	7043065	We're going to dive into the email bag headfirst and read your emails.
7043605	7048889	DarkSakura wants to set it out tonight because she's going to be nursing her throat with some tea so she doesn't cough and die on air.
7049229	7058175	So I'm going to read some emails tonight, and we're going to start with a couple here from Holly D. Holly D. in chat says, Are you guys going to make an Orange Lounge guild for Rift like you did with WoW?
7058555	7059936	If so, let us know the shard.
7061657	7089632	nothing official from my standpoint I actually let my Rift subscription lapse sorry it's just I didn't want to pay for multiple games at once so I might go back to it later like if there's a really cool expansion or something but I let it lapse so I don't know if there's enough Rift people out there then by all means we should start something but I don't know if we have a lot of OLR listeners playing Rift we'll have to see ask on the forums that would be a good place to check that out orangelongradio.com
7091732	7095813	Holly sends us another email about Sony and more hacks going on.
7096213	7104935	So apparently being hacked once, writes Holly, and taking the network down, then again, then on a different website, compromising millions of accounts, it has happened again.
7105336	7110357	This time it was not customer information, but the entirety of the source code for the PSN network.
7110777	7111037	How?
7111698	7113759	Sony never fixed the original vulnerability.
7114059	7117281	Everyone waited for four weeks for PSN to come back for nothing.
7117681	7119342	That's not good that that leaked out.
7119382	7125604	I'm not just sure if this level of idiocy can be covered by the phrase monumental stupidity, but I'm sure it's a start.
7125685	7127465	And we get linked to a website.
7128246	7133128	She links us to a story from JupiterBroadcasting.com, which I don't think I've ever heard of.
7135774	7136815	Yeah, let's see.
7136895	7148505	A hacker group got into hacking Sony on June 6th and they leaked the source code to the Sony PSN developers network and that could allow people to find more flaws of the Sony system very quickly.
7149366	7151808	It could also open up a private PSN network.
7152688	7158293	They got all the source code and of course this was all happening after Sony was supposed to be fixed.
7158553	7162297	The hacker group used an SQL injection attack against Sony Pictures.
7162717	7167101	They got 150,000 records from the database of more than 4.5 million records.
7167721	7168001	Wow.
7173146	7173987	Hackers gonna hack.
7174347	7177750	Not that that makes it right, but again, change passwords.
7178851	7180292	Use different passwords on different websites.
7181473	7185055	Going to an email now from Janai.
7185895	7193138	Dear OLR, I found a horror point-and-click game on the Xbox Live Indie Games section called Decay.
7193698	7198260	I can describe it as Deja Vu meets Silent Hill in an atmospheric way.
7198620	7201862	There are three episodes costing 240 Microsoft points each.
7202302	7204723	I think it is a highly polished game for an indie developer.
7205043	7206643	I would like to hear your comments on this game
7231095	7232956	I like the idea of more point and click adventure games.
7234257	7239101	Yeah, it looks like there's part two, part three, part four is the final part.
7240241	7240862	That's pretty cool.
7242063	7242823	I'll have to check that out.
7243484	7243744	Oops.
7244584	7245685	Why is Twitter music playing?
7247787	7248327	Audio fail.
7249921	7254843	Moving on to another email from Haseo Sumiragawa.
7255324	7256424	Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.
7256544	7264828	I make music videos using cutscenes from video games, and I'm having trouble finding a download site that uses the right kind of codec that works on Windows Movie Maker.
7265209	7267090	It says that it's an unregistered file.
7267350	7268950	Hey, Loki, you're good with movies, right?
7268990	7269591	You should listen to this.
7270211	7273355	I make music videos using cutscenes for video games.
7273395	7277840	I'm having trouble finding a download site that has the right kind of codec that works on Windows Movie Maker.
7278180	7282385	So if you three or the chat could help in directing me to that area, I would be grateful.
7282525	7284848	I'm looking for Bayonetta cutscenes preferably.
7285749	7288212	How do you get cutscenes that you can use in Windows Movie Maker?
7289487	7292068	I don't remember what exactly Windows Movie Maker uses.
7292128	7294329	I'm sure it's just Windows Media stuff.
7294389	7304473	I mean, it's all about having the correct codecs on your system, on your PC, so just download some of the community codec packs and stuff like that and hopefully they'll work.
7305293	7307494	You can even dump YouTubes to movie files, right?
7307534	7307855	Can't you?
7308835	7309855	It's not the best quality.
7309875	7311436	You can't if you have the right stuff.
7312196	7314497	I use RealPlayer to download them offline.
7314617	7316238	Whoa, RealPlayer still exists?
7316698	7323647	Yeah, actually, a real player has a download thing that'll convert it to MP4 or anything.
7323927	7327672	Damn, real players are what I used to use to watch episodes of Downloaded South Park in, like, 98.
7328789	7352282	or just like you know looking for like some sort of universal file converters and stuff like that see if you can find anything that's meant for that because I've really I honestly don't use Movie Maker I use Adobe Premiere so that usually doesn't have a problem opening anything here's some comments from our chat room at chat.orange.com Scott Pilgrim says there's your problem you use Windows Movie Maker but download the K-Lite codec pack that should help
7353162	7381899	Frisbee says get a Linux distro and use Kdenlive and SSJ100 Matt even backs it up saying download something other than Windows Movie Maker Frisbee says or OpenShot that might be tough because Windows Movie Maker might be the program you're comfortable with but there are other alternatives out there they're all basically the same there's a little bit of a learning curve for example Premiere when I first started using it I was like what the hell am I doing and now I'm a little bit more comfortable with it now that I've used it for a while
7382159	7408303	MovieMaker I tried using one time and I don't know it it's a little too basic we use Adobe Audition actually to produce the podcast and at first it can look really overwhelming because there's all these features that you know for a podcast you don't really need but all the you know sound the opening that you hear was was kind of mixed together in Audition you know so Adobe products are pretty good anyhow let's go on to the rest of the email here from Haseo Sumiragawa
7408951	7412492	Also, I would like to chime in with the new gimmicky systems announced at E3.
7412832	7414853	Both have really lame names.
7415473	7418374	Who in their right minds came up with Vita and Wii U?
7418754	7420575	Shame on you, Sony, Nintendo.
7420955	7422315	We saw this coming.
7422655	7424096	Well, thanks for reading my humble little email.
7424116	7430218	Vita, I'm not too... It's a weird name, but they also have the Sony VAIO, and that works.
7430758	7433179	I like the PSV that comes out of that.
7433239	7435740	I think that might have been something they were going for.
7435780	7438701	But all they had to do was, like, PSP2.
7438881	7441722	Why has it got to be something fancy like the Vita?
7442202	7446303	See, I think that with that whole back thing, they could have called it the PlayStation Touch.
7447284	7448344	And then it could be the Psst.
7449444	7449764	Psst.
7451745	7452165	Think about it.
7452645	7453186	It'd be clever.
7453306	7455186	Looking for Groot, Barrett & Holt, PST.
7455526	7459068	Or the PlayStation Reach Around, because you can reach around the back.
7460740	7486221	and Fondle the Back Wii U is definitely one that's getting a lot of people have made the joke about I thought it was a university for Mario things like that but you gotta go well everybody made fun of Wii when it first came out so again let's see the games to back up the name Wii U does not
7488786	7489947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7509645	7509945	Weird.
7510766	7512127	Yeah, weird, weird.
7512708	7515411	All right, moving on with some other emails.
7515451	7518374	Speaking of Wii U, we have an email from...
7521153	7528923	I let the Wii U and subsequent chatter in the back of my brain for a while and here's a few things that fell out.
7529223	7533188	Number one, Wii U, like Michael Patcher said, is the dumbest name ever.
7533529	7536693	Of course, it is the most memorable name ever too.
7536993	7538034	It won't hurt the sales.
7538875	7542117	2.
7539376	7542117	Wii U is in danger by revealing its hand too soon.
7542438	7546420	The PS Vita could do the same thing for the PS3 if they want to steal the idea.
7547181	7553025	I'm with you there, Robabub, because the PSP... Remember, in 2006, they were showing the Ridge Racer with the rearview mirror.
7554506	7560390	Also, if the iPad had a working controller pad dock similar to the Wii U tablet, it could instantly steal the idea.
7560510	7564013	And look, you can play your games anywhere you want instead of being stuck at home.
7564153	7565754	The iPad 2 can already do that.
7566194	7570317	Didn't I see a story this week about some racing game that was being played through the Apple TV unit?
7570337	7573220	Well, they had that for a while where they were doing that.
7573360	7577863	Basically, it was Real Racing 2 HD, and you can do that through the HDMI port.
7578483	7602394	and use the tablet as like a map and stuff so you can do that already and I mean that may be a way that they're gonna combat this stuff especially especially if they decide hey later on that we're gonna go ahead and you know put out Apple TV that plays games then they're gonna have you know you're gonna control stuff with your iPod or whatever and iPad and you may have that similar type of stuff so I don't know
7602834	7607336	And one more thing, Michael Patcher thought Vita was the second worst name for a system.
7607736	7608377	I disagree.
7608557	7612259	Since Vita has meaning in and of itself, I need to give Sony credit for it.
7612579	7617301	In fact, his analysis of Nintendo and Sony indicate a bias towards Sony not backed up by history.
7617701	7619842	Look, Ma, I'm a video game analyst.
7620302	7620623	P.S.
7620663	7623024	I really hope the Vita doesn't get the name of Vita Max.
7623184	7625545	I hope they start calling it Vita Vita Vegemen, but that's just me.
7626681	7631605	Well, I mean, this Patcher guy, you could look at him the same way we talked about reviewers earlier in the show.
7632105	7637889	I bet a lot of you guys listen to us every week because, you know, we're the show where every gamer has a voice, but we're the three that you hear every week.
7637949	7643193	And you probably keep listening to us because you kind of like what we have to say, you know, in our analysis.
7643253	7649477	I mean, we joke about it on the show sometimes that we're also video game analysts, or as I say, video game analists sometimes.
7649617	7671414	but uh it's it's sort of true I think you guys tune into the show because you like our perspective on things and you know I don't know this guy I don't know this Michael Patcher guy so I'm not trying to say this disrespectfully but what the fuck makes him so goddamn special like you know I see his name everywhere and on these websites and stuff but he's just some asshole spouting off predictions just like me
7673860	7675200	I guess he has a degree or something?
7676021	7679502	He works for Web Rush Morgan, I believe.
7683783	7684223	Whatever.
7684243	7684663	You know what?
7684683	7688465	The guy... Does anyone call him out for all the stuff that he's wrong on?
7688565	7689705	No, everyone forgets.
7690385	7692266	Everyone reports about what he says.
7692386	7697167	It's just like when they were reporting about Voldemort talking about this and that and stuff.
7697187	7698568	And everyone reports on it because...
7699148	7699808	That's what they do.
7699828	7701148	They're always saying something.
7701289	7702369	Let's talk about it.
7703409	7703889	He's saying this.
7703909	7705349	He must have some insider information.
7705449	7706030	No, he doesn't.
7706090	7707510	He's a guy guessing on stuff.
7707870	7709270	Except he gets paid a lot more than I do.
7709310	7710231	He has a different background.
7710411	7712051	And again, I'm not trying to sound disrespectful.
7712211	7722613	I realize this comes off completely rude, but the reality is I care no more or no less about his opinion than I do Roboba's opinion.
7724034	7724694	They're equal to me.
7724794	7725474	They're both gamers.
7727045	7727845	You know what I mean?
7727886	7731087	And actually, I like Robaba just slightly more because he actually listens to the show.
7731348	7732488	Michael Hatcher is not a gamer.
7732508	7734049	He doesn't know shit about games.
7734670	7737631	Robaba is great.
7737691	7740693	Going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com Here comes Ego Boost.
7740713	7740993	You ready?
7741333	7748738	Breakman says, We listen to you every week because one week we expect DarkSakura to announce her plans for world domination and she needs followers, right?
7749198	7750479	Dude, that was in like episode four.
7752290	7755892	Best besides that, why would I announce my plans for world domination?
7755972	7759193	Her plan for world domination is give me a dollar or a taco.
7759773	7760934	No, why would I announce it?
7760974	7766837	Because it's going to be mysterious and who knows, I might have already taken over the world.
7767797	7794913	It's just that I don't want the responsibility We already are the official video game podcast of the galaxy We are We talked about this a long time ago Is that we've declared that we are the official video game podcast of the galaxy And that's that Dibs, patent pending But actually I do have to say that, you know Dominating the entire world Think about all of the paperwork And all of the stuff you'd have to manage I just like, I'll let the world fuck itself up
7796129	7797430	Oh yeah, we did give Bobby Pluto.
7797930	7798430	We did give that.
7799191	7800852	Bobby can have all of the dwarf planets.
7801872	7806435	Ceres, Pluto, and its oddly shaped moons.
7806835	7807735	Alright, moving on.
7810097	7810697	One other email.
7810717	7812538	Last email tonight from Spazinator.
7814296	7816397	Your space bar is broken or something.
7816437	7817957	You have words running together here.
7819358	7820538	Was this typed on a PSP?
7820658	7820958	I don't know.
7820978	7823079	But anyway, I'm going to do my best to get through this email.
7823679	7824519	Hey, OLR.
7824979	7832161	Instead of the usual topics that I typically bring up via email and Twitter topics, I thought I'd give my impressions of a recent downloadable game release.
7832321	7835522	Magic the Gathering Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, a.k.a.
7835582	7835882	Magic 2012.
7836762	7838323	I forgot that came out this week, but it's only 2011.
7839463	7840024	Alright, so fine.
7840064	7841485	Magic 2012 is coming out.
7842145	7843366	I really like these kind of emails.
7843746	7847189	I want to hear reviews, especially on games I haven't played but I have a slight interest in.
7847549	7849631	I like the last Magic game, so let's see.
7851308	7858355	For those out there that are unfamiliar with the Magic games, this is the second in the series, which is the video game adaptation of Magic the Gathering card game.
7858856	7867404	Those who have played the card game at one point or another will have practically no problem picking up this game, while newbies might have a marginally more difficult time with it due to the learning curve.
7867704	7868825	But even then, it's not too bad.
7869246	7871068	All in all, it's a faithful recreation of the game.
7871428	7875212	Those who have picked up the original game last year really should pick up this one as well.
7875532	7892291	there are no noticeable bugs at least on the PSN version and from what I can tell the devs have taken user input to heart and implemented much needed improvements while it's not perfect it's a drastic improvement over the first assuming that you haven't picked up the original game yet you want to pick up a cheap game I suggest passing
7893292	7897175	I suggest passing over the original game and just going for Magic 2012.
7898156	7906041	Frankly, I find this to be pretty damn fun in a major time sink, rivaling the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in terms of amount of time that will inevitably be spent in this game.
7906561	7914387	While the single player stuff is fun and will be played a lot initially for the purposes of unlocking stuff, the real meat and potatoes of the game is the multiplayer, which frankly is a blast.
7914807	7920954	Additionally, if you're a trophy or achievement whore, the 20 achievements or trophies in the game are easiest hell to get, even by my standards.
7921295	7924599	Even my grandmother can get them easily, and she's been dead for 14 years.
7925059	7926341	Wow, that was morbid.
7927213	7929255	All in all, I can't recommend this game enough.
7929655	7937542	It is available for both Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft Points and on PSN at its regular price for non-PS Plus members for $9.99.
7938082	7944007	However, due to most people having a minimum of one month's worth of PS Plus, you can get the game at a discount, $7.99.
7944548	7948011	So I give the PSN version an ever so slight edge, if only for that reason.
7948703	7950203	Dude, and you're totally a Sony fanboy.
7950243	7951004	Don't even try to deny it.
7951844	7953304	No, but pricing is a good point.
7953984	7957405	Thanks for reading this email, and sorry to DarkSakura for sending this wall of text.
7957725	7959406	I just wanted to be thorough with my review.
7959726	7963587	You should be so thankful she's not reading emails this week, because the whole space thing, she would have screamed.
7966127	7966987	Use your space!
7967428	7967828	Space.
7968188	7968508	Space.
7968888	7969548	I'm the best at space.
7969828	7970068	Space.
7972289	7973969	We were doing that on Space Mountain, by the way.
7974289	7977590	He liked magic so much that the space bar got stuck.
7978081	7979542	We were doing that on Space Mountain, remember?
7980162	7980882	I do, I remember that.
7981802	7982703	I'm the best at space.
7983123	7984183	So much space, gotta see it all.
7986064	7987184	And then we did it on Star Tours.
7988445	7988625	Yes.
7989545	7990685	Which, by the way, is an awesome ride.
7991706	7993886	Is it a lot better now that they've fixed it?
7994887	7998588	You know, the old one was charming, but it is definitely modern now.
7998708	7999888	It's a lot smoother.
8000349	8004330	And it's just, what I love about the ride is it just starts right off with a bang.
8004630	8007491	Like, you know, and you are on your way to whatever planet you go to.
8007779	8015441	For the record, we looked up how many different scenes and at least with me and Dan, we've got all the beginnings.
8015461	8016421	There were two different beginnings.
8017321	8019721	We've got all but one of the second one.
8019741	8020362	We didn't get Hoth.
8020962	8022402	And I've been to Hoth, so it's cool.
8022802	8023402	It's the best one.
8024002	8025523	We got all three of the middle scenes.
8026083	8029543	The third one, which is either Yoda, Ackbar, or Leia.
8030144	8030704	It's a trap!
8031024	8031304	I know.
8031684	8033524	And then we got all but the last.
8034104	8034905	All but Coruscant.
8035305	8036345	Coruscant's the worst one.
8036465	8036805	Naboo's...
8037345	8044131	I would say, riding the ride several times, I've gotten, I've seen all the last planets and I've seen all the, I've seen every planet now.
8044451	8048135	And I will tell you the best ones are Hoth for the first and Naboo.
8048495	8051237	Believe it or not, the Jar Jar Binks planet is the best, because it has the best ending.
8051398	8052098	Oh, it was great.
8052138	8054140	Well, I did like the Death Star one.
8054160	8055221	The Death Star one was pretty rad.
8055241	8056562	That's a close second.
8056682	8059705	Of what we got, though, my favorite was Kashyyyk, because I like Wookiees.
8061887	8062107	Anyhow.
8062813	8066676	We'll stop nerding about Star Tours now and get to the FUs of the week.
8066756	8068438	It's the part of the show where we rant.
8068578	8068938	Why?
8069278	8070019	Because we can.
8086491	8087472	F you to being sick.
8089094	8090876	It's not like it's a contagious disease.
8090956	8093499	It's on my sinuses and it happens around this time of year.
8094660	8095921	I wanted to go swimming today.
8096502	8099965	As a result, I laid down for what I intended to be an hour nap at 1030.
8100266	8101787	I woke up at 330.
8103229	8107013	Having slept through my alarm seven times, apparently I kept resetting it in my sleep.
8108260	8109821	So yeah.
8137879	8139280	Yeah, what?
8140440	8140760	F you.
8141300	8141581	Loki?
8143761	8148243	F you to fighting with my console and try to get it to work on my computer right now.
8149084	8163569	It took me a while because it was set to 1080i and it really needed to be 480p and I even did the thing to reset the graphics, you know, the quick little hold Y and the right trigger and restart your console, but it just didn't want to work.
8164570	8165110	I got the work done.
8167136	8196353	Alright, going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com Some follow-ups to some things from the email bag Xenacore is in chat saying To add to the email, you can get the Magic game for free If your PSN Plus is active You can play it for free as long as the PlayStation Plus is still on your account Nice, so if you want to go see If Spazinator is correct in his Magic review You can use your 30-day trial that most people are on right now And check it out, it's pretty cool I like that
8197768	8206437	Alright, let's move on to a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8206657	8207578	We'll get to that in just a moment.
8208118	8210140	Moving on, though, first, a couple more stories.
8210180	8210400	Loki.
8210941	8216126	And of course, you know, one story that's been around ever since Duke Nukem Forever was being
8216206	8218608	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Duke Nukem Forever
8235542	8255435	and along with that Gearbox even sent him a bunch of cool swag and stuff like that so apparently he does like the game the guy that picked up the game so good for him glad that they you know took your receipt that you kept all this time
8257754	8262397	Alright, one more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up that Skype line.
8262417	8268880	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and unfortunately we end on a bit of a sad note tonight.
8268920	8272943	It's another game studio who apparently has closed in their doors.
8273443	8276004	Game Republic is the studio.
8276425	8278386	Apparently the website has disappeared.
8278446	8279426	It's no longer online.
8279466	8281888	The Tokyo offices now vacated.
8282868	8285430	Apparently the founder Yoshihiki Okamoto
8286110	8290472	Huge amounts of debt and can't be tracked down, so unfortunately it looks like they've closed.
8290492	8301276	Some of the games that they made, Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, Folklore was another game that they made, and I believe they were the studio behind Genji Day of the Blade, if I'm not mistaking.
8301756	8302736	I think that's right.
8302756	8306338	The studio, of course, infamous for the giant enemy crabs.
8307538	8312021	And while a lot of people are pointing and laughing at that whole thing, it's never any fun to report developers losing their jobs.
8312621	8315923	It's a shitty economy right now, no matter where you live.
8315943	8317944	All right, let's open up the Skype line.
8318004	8322687	It's open now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8323868	8328431	While we wait for those calls to come in, I'm going to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories.
8330951	8331891	Um, not really.
8332031	8334912	I mean, there's not a whole lot else that we have to report on.
8335213	8339654	I was going to talk really quick, though, about, uh, there are some indie games that they're showing off.
8340474	8344696	Um, and one of them, uh, was, was it Revolver 360?
8344736	8348677	It's this game that's on the, uh, Xbox indie games.
8349498	8350058	And, um...
8350798	8351518	It's pretty awesome.
8351558	8354259	I mean, it just kind of goes to show you that there's hidden gems out there.
8354279	8357580	It's basically kind of almost like a cave-style shooter.
8357820	8359660	It's just bullet hell like crazy.
8360000	8369883	But what makes it unique is that you can rotate around in kind of this 3D sphere, so you can rotate the environment around.
8369943	8375925	So if, for example, you have bullets coming at you in a big line, you can actually rotate it so that they're...
8377285	8379027	I'm still pissed off about my Yard's Revenge purchase
8405528	8410132	Oh gosh, I heard this game was not so great, but what happened to you?
8410932	8414835	Well, the idea behind the game was solid.
8415035	8422121	I mean, it's just an old school corridor shooter like Lucky and Wild or anything else like that from the arcade.
8422301	8424122	At least that's the way it felt to me when I was playing it.
8424723	8429847	But just certain rudimentary things that were going on slipped through the cracks.
8429867	8432949	It's like if it really got rushed, I think is what happened to it.
8433149	8433830	Oh, I hate that.
8434150	8436632	I hate that when games are so obviously rushed.
8437333	8443017	I mean, the game is functional, but it looks like, I mean, the coders didn't finish putting the polish on everything.
8443037	8446740	When you first started, at least on the PC version of what I'm playing, it's not full screen.
8446760	8447941	You can see the Windows border.
8449202	8453486	Yeah, so, I mean, most savvy users, you hit Alt-Enter, it will go into Windows mode.
8454190	8456952	But because of the age of my machine, I can't put it in the DirectX 10.
8457232	8459093	So I'm not sure if I'm looking at the right graphics.
8460634	8463036	And the gameplay is a bit rough.
8463396	8464337	It's just not polished.
8464377	8468620	I think it really got rushed, which kind of disappoints me because I sort of like the new idea they're going with it.
8468936	8473158	How do you feel about all these reimaginings of classic games?
8473178	8477819	This is something Atari has really done a lot of and is going to continue to do over the next year.
8477859	8483521	I think they've got a Centipede game coming out on 3DS, Warlords they've revisited.
8483541	8487463	They're really trying to bank on nostalgia redone, I guess.
8487603	8488383	What do you think about that?
8489003	8492705	I bought into that initially when they're doing that with the Xbox Live Arcade.
8492745	8493785	I got a lot of those games.
8493925	8501968	But, you know, sadly, all the multiplayer stuff, hardly anybody plays them, even when they first came out, plays a multiplayer, which kind of disappointed me.
8502008	8506390	I was really looking forward to like Tron Deadly Disc multiplayer and it's not happening.
8507150	8508511	So that was kind of upsetting.
8508551	8511532	But as long as they add enough to the game to where...
8512242	8515564	If they're charging $10, it feels justified to me, then it's fine.
8515624	8517125	They've got to really polish it up.
8517486	8523470	Or like what they did with Yard's Revenge, they changed the whole dynamic and used it as inspiration for their game.
8523510	8525431	I'm cool with that, but just make sure you finish it.
8526452	8527252	Give me finished stuff.
8527312	8527853	That's all I want.
8528153	8529134	Yeah, it's kind of tough.
8529154	8533877	Yard's Revenge was really easily one of the top three Atari 2600 games they ever released.
8534577	8537359	And just to kind of take a classic and just rush it?
8537860	8538660	Oh, that hurts.
8539301	8539481	Mm-hmm.
8540822	8543305	It's not even that the game was badly designed.
8543366	8545128	It's like the interface.
8545208	8551276	It's like normally when you're doing typesetting or whatever, you leave the text up on the screen long enough to where you can read it twice.
8552178	8556083	If you're a speed reader, you might just catch everything and be able to understand what you read.
8557464	8558625	It's that quick on screen.
8558725	8561546	Even during the game, there's no speech.
8561966	8563907	Everything's in a chat bubble over on the corner.
8564167	8565428	You're not looking there at all.
8565748	8568449	So you have no idea what the characters are saying to each other.
8568549	8569889	I barely understood what was going on.
8569929	8575151	But thanks to me reading lots of fan-subbed anime and stuff, I'm used to looking at subtitles.
8575171	8577112	So I managed to catch everything.
8577132	8579853	What other games have you been playing lately?
8579893	8580874	Anything else you want to throw out there?
8582875	8585736	I'm mainly doing a lot of anime watching.
8586836	8592758	The overseas stuff, the X-Men stuff, and the Green Lantern release that just came out recently, the animated version.
8593539	8596380	Speaking of Green Lantern, did you hear the news today?
8596440	8597040	The new movie...
8598261	8611209	It made $53 million, which to me sounds like a lot of money, but apparently considering the budget and the marketing, apparently they are calling that the very, very low end of expectations that doesn't bode well for a sequel later on.
8611890	8614852	Yeah, I think they were initially predicting they'd get around $70, $75.
8616909	8619531	So I'm thinking that number's right around where Thor was.
8619731	8625036	Well, funny enough, the story I'd read referenced the Thor opening, and it did open below Thor.
8625396	8631061	And when you consider that, I guess they said, which I found weird, the Green Lantern was more well-known than Thor.
8631081	8633683	And that was, again, the source that I read, whatever.
8633763	8638227	But you could say that the actor in Thor was an unknown, whereas Ryan Reynolds, people know him.
8638287	8639268	So that was kind of an ouch.
8639915	8643159	Yeah, I think it's because everybody knew he'd be better as a Ryle Rayner.
8643840	8646724	Or, excuse me, I get my lantern screwed up here.
8647125	8648547	He's playing the wrong lantern, in other words.
8648707	8649107	We knew it.
8649348	8650609	So that's the problem.
8650890	8652872	More proof that Deadpool should have come out already.
8654074	8655997	Because you know he'd be perfect for Deadpool.
8656437	8657237	Oh, yeah, we knew that.
8657918	8658518	We geeks know.
8658958	8662019	All right, I'm going to let you go, Zena.
8662039	8664940	Of course, we can take more calls, but thanks for the review on yours, Revenge.
8665540	8666060	No problem, man.
8666080	8666440	Take it easy.
8666460	8667801	Take care.
8667821	8669661	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8669742	8671522	I like this tonight.
8671662	8675463	It's like we're getting reviews from everybody on games I haven't been able to touch.
8675684	8676404	This is pretty nice.
8676684	8678444	So let's see if we get another one.
8678464	8678685	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8680465	8682446	or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8682807	8686449	Let me ask you this, DarkSakura, while we wait for some calls and Loki left the room for a minute.
8686689	8691612	You know, we were talking about nostalgia on that last call in a game like Yars' Revenge that they've reimagined.
8693773	8696615	You really still kind of live in the nostalgia world a little bit.
8696855	8700478	You really probably play more retro games than you do current games.
8700658	8703580	I mean, that's not hidden by your gaming weeks and so forth.
8703940	8705841	How do you feel about a lot of these reimaginings?
8708416	8716105	I really... It's kind of weird for me because if they're done faithfully, then I have no problem with it.
8716185	8720570	If they take the basic concept and evolve it, I'm really excited by that.
8721251	8724435	But if it's just, you know...
8726337	8730680	My concept of butchering a game is pretty personal.
8730800	8732001	It's going to be different for everybody.
8733001	8738745	But if they just take it and completely ruin aspects of it that I thought were great, then no.
8738845	8741347	Like if they took the Guardian Legend and filled it full of blood.
8742868	8743008	No.
8743348	8745850	Alright, let's go to the phones because we've got more calls coming in.
8745890	8746931	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8746951	8747291	Who's this?
8749077	8749938	This is TakeiQ.
8750378	8751218	TakeiQ!
8751439	8752099	What's on your mind, buddy?
8753600	8755321	This is more of like a Loki question.
8755481	8755701	Okay.
8755761	8759323	Any tips on upgrading a PS3 Slims hard drive?
8760364	8760984	Loki, did you hear that?
8761124	8763246	Any tips on upgrading a PS3 Slims hard drive?
8763646	8769530	Just make sure you back up everything to something else first, and then it's pretty easy.
8769570	8772231	I mean, you just pop it in there and then format it.
8773272	8776234	You do have to make sure it's formatted FAT32, I think, though.
8779026	8780408	Are there any online resources?
8781469	8782630	Just search online.
8783471	8787754	There's a thing from HP that you can format anything, FAT32.
8787895	8790637	I did my external laptop.
8790717	8791358	You don't need that.
8791378	8792419	All you have to do is run it through DOS.
8794507	8796168	What are you expanding the hard drive on your PS3 for?
8796268	8797349	Are you trying to fit more porn?
8798249	8803293	No, I feel like I'm running out of space on my 120 that came with it.
8803653	8806515	You know, I have an 80 gig and I feel like I'm starting to run out of space too.
8806555	8813899	And a lot of it is because now, thanks to the free games, I'm installing these 5, 6 gigabyte games on the drive.
8814640	8816541	And yeah, I'm kind of with you.
8816581	8817822	I'm ready to expand my drive too.
8818082	8821064	Do you download a lot of movies on PlayStation Marketplace or is it all like gameplay?
8821624	8828971	Well, I'm mostly using Vudu now for the streaming since I don't like downloading from the PSN store because it takes a while.
8829291	8832213	Why do you like Vudu as compared to Hulu and Netflix?
8832254	8834656	I don't usually hear that one, but I'm curious to know more about it.
8834676	8836077	It's more for the new releases.
8836517	8838799	It's like Walmart for new releases.
8840300	8846285	Sometimes they have a sale for $0.99 for a more recent movie I can watch that Netflix doesn't have.
8846666	8846826	Right.
8847850	8848671	Alright, very cool.
8848711	8851934	And like the new releases, you can just stream it instead of downloading it.
8852735	8857980	You know, download takes like maybe two hours, three hours, or streaming, you just, it's there.
8858618	8859659	Rob, you would love Desperate Housewives
8882273	8886555	because I like that campy type of stuff, and I guess that show's very campy, but never seen an episode.
8887276	8887716	Sunday nights.
8888116	8889697	I'm like, if it's on Sunday nights, I've never watched it.
8890738	8892479	And I have another thing, another question, too.
8892579	8894780	Sure.
8894820	8898702	Do you have to, like, download the firmware update when you're upgrading the hard drive?
8898922	8901084	Like, I've read, like, articles on it that you have to.
8901924	8904926	Loki left the room for a minute, so I'm not sure because I haven't changed mine.
8904966	8905306	Loki!
8908584	8909364	Firmware update.
8909424	8911925	Do you have to do a firmware update when you change those drives?
8916086	8922168	I think you may have to redo your current firmware update to change them over.
8922988	8929790	It says that you have to do it again and it's supposed to not work afterwards but I went from my 20 to my 500.
8931090	8932291	Maybe I didn't go back to my 20.
8932531	8934231	I thought about going back to my 20 but I never did.
8934691	8936212	Can you use a USB drive with those?
8936252	8937312	This might be a dumb question but
8937591	8939292	You can, but you can't store games to it.
8939852	8939952	Oh.
8940913	8941213	Interesting.
8941233	8942014	Do you do movies?
8942174	8943335	You can put movies on there.
8943435	8945256	You can put pictures, music.
8946637	8946857	Nice.
8947357	8949198	But you have to have certain directories and stuff.
8949799	8950059	All right.
8950639	8950919	All right.
8950959	8953301	Well, any other thoughts for us tonight before we let you go?
8954501	8955342	Bye-bye SOCOM.
8957263	8958424	Why do you say bye-bye SOCOM?
8959244	8959925	Didn't like the game.
8960205	8963207	I rented it and didn't like the controls that you can't change it.
8964187	8965088	Oh, I hate that.
8965368	8968492	Customizability should be like one of the first easy things to think about.
8969113	8970154	How irritating.
8970294	8973017	I'm very, I guess, Call of Duty player.
8973478	8977622	You got to have the triggers to fire and iron sightsees.
8978683	8981707	And it's worth doing it on the R&L buttons instead of the triggers.
8983072	8985976	Alright, well, we're going to let you go and we get some more calls.
8985996	8987818	But thanks for your call and good luck with the PS3 upgrade.
8988479	8988779	Thank you.
8988940	8990562	Alright, later.
8990582	8993005	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.
8993025	8994907	We can probably fit one more call in tonight.
8995448	8998552	So, we'll see if we get any other calls.
8998793	9000174	We're out of last minute stories, right?
9001055	9001276	So...
9004664	9005584	We'll see if anybody calls.
9005625	9006085	Oh, there it is.
9006165	9006525	Lighten up.
9006906	9010849	There's always that little delay between when we say something and when it goes out over the air.
9011249	9012110	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9012130	9012450	Who's this?
9013230	9014351	It's the one and only Ranma.
9014451	9015012	Of course.
9015092	9019175	I knew you'd get through eventually ever since you said in chat that I missed your Twitter topic.
9019195	9019775	Sorry about that.
9020316	9020736	It's okay.
9020796	9021377	I forgive you.
9021597	9027221	I wasn't reading chronologically this week because we got a few that I wanted to make sure I mentioned before today.
9027682	9028983	So that's why I screwed up.
9029083	9029443	But anyway.
9030043	9030584	Fair enough.
9031324	9031865	What's on your mind?
9033223	9034864	Duke Nukem Forever.
9035885	9036345	What about it?
9037606	9038967	It's a guilty pleasure game.
9039247	9041849	To me, the game is so bad, it's just good.
9042149	9043730	So it's like the showgirls of video games?
9044450	9045831	Something along those lines, yes.
9047192	9051975	Tell us about how this game is so bad, it's good.
9052015	9055938	Give an example of something in the game that happens where you're like, oh my god, this is terrible and I love it.
9056819	9061862	For example, if you remember from the demo, there are two twins in the game.
9062912	9064814	They're called the Wholesome Twins.
9066575	9067616	Mary and Kate.
9070779	9072681	So no secret what that's parodying, huh?
9073342	9074142	Yeah, pretty much.
9074283	9078607	And they show a video clip of them doing a video to a song called Full House.
9079147	9079868	Oh, that's terrible.
9081102	9109688	very terrible I heard something about they die horribly later on like spoilers OMG but I don't know I'm at the point where the aliens kidnap them and Duke's all pissed the fuck off about it I hear it's not a pretty ending like it actually has some people kind of saying that that's where that is exactly where the game crosses the line just so you know I won't ruin it for you but you don't kill the hot chicks you don't do that I hear the ending is like wow but we'll see
9111069	9114210	So what do you think about these websites that are giving the game a zero?
9115691	9124316	I think the sites that are giving the game a zero are coming from people who did not grow up playing the original Duke Nukem 3D.
9124756	9129339	It sounds like these are people that are younger than me who don't know their ass from a hole in the wall.
9130119	9136583	Also, they're counting on the fact that Gearbox is working on it, so they expected something big like Borderlands.
9137043	9141027	As I said before, all Gearbox said that they were going to do was put the game out.
9141507	9143609	They never said what they were going to do exactly.
9144129	9148933	And so the wait of 12 plus years is like, okay, let's see what you got.
9149974	9152957	It seems like they were just looking for a reason to just blast the game.
9153237	9171128	here comes Dan the man wants to say something on this topic yeah it should be on just make sure oh god geez it makes everybody wonder why they weren't putting it out oh because it sucked nuts and they knew it they were like holy fucking god we can't fix it it's terrible and there you go that's what y'all fucking get
9171690	9199829	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god Fucking even Gearbox couldn't polish that turd And Gearbox rules Great, Duke Duke comes over Fucking finish the next Brothers in Arms Or whatever the fuck you're doing And get to work on Borderlands 2 But Rama says Rama's review of the game is that This game is so bad, it's good I hope to find out When I'm done with the game I will ship it overnight to you so you can play it You don't have to, I'm getting a copy Oh, there you go
9201510	9206335	SSJ100 Matt in the chat room is making a request that that should be the next game I have my mom watch me play.
9206715	9207095	We'll see.
9207636	9208176	We'll see.
9209657	9211259	We already got our Mortal Kombat reactions.
9213581	9214221	I could see that.
9214321	9214982	Really, I could.
9216103	9218745	Alright, well anything else you've been playing lately you want to share real quick?
9220605	9225690	No, I really, well, I've been playing games on my phone really, so, you know, yeah.
9225730	9226611	Wait, do you have an iPhone?
9227251	9228612	No, I have an Android phone.
9228833	9229113	Oh, okay.
9229493	9234958	I was going to ask if you've been playing these Gameloft games and if they're as horrible of a ripoff as everyone says they are.
9235418	9244907	The only corporate game, portable minigame I've been playing is Words with Friends, but due to my job, I just keep forgetting to log in and catch up with playing, you know?
9246437	9274669	Other than that, I just found this knockoff of a pipe dream game I find myself playing all the damn time Alright, well Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for calling Oh wait, you didn't go to Nintendo World today That surprises me Number one, I didn't even know about it and number two, I am so backlogged from Anime Next, I've just been sitting here working on videos and uploading them all day, that's all I've been doing is just post-con work I was just saying, I was looking at JV Mom Pictures and Black Luigi was nowhere to be found
9275089	9279131	See, now, I have a phone to pick with JV Monk because he has my number.
9279292	9281933	He could have texted a brother and said this was going on.
9282734	9291679	I wouldn't have to wear black Luigi, but I sure as hell have a black Zelda outfit I could have easily thrown together and shown the fuck up with.
9292617	9292797	Nice.
9310817	9313358	I would say Anime Boston, but fuck Anime Boston.
9313558	9315899	PAX East, I may be walking around in size.
9315999	9318520	I just want to see the chocobo in your hair.
9320060	9325062	Do you know how many people want to make the wig with the chocobo in it?
9325422	9329403	I'm like, first person that does it, gets it to me first, is the winner.
9329683	9330464	Simple as that.
9331404	9334705	I'll tell you what, if I can lose enough weight, I'll be Snow.
9335765	9337046	I'll be the guy that everybody hates.
9337529	9340251	No, no, no, no.
9340451	9342293	I don't need you as snow.
9343314	9344775	We can't have that.
9344875	9346096	What, you want me to be vanilla?
9347297	9348358	I want you to be lightning.
9349298	9354823	Well, Rob, you're fabulous enough to pull it off, so why the fuck not?
9357425	9358386	Thank you, I think.
9359960	9361721	Even better, I got one better before I go.
9361921	9367303	Since Salacious Pop loves panty and stocking, the two of you should do panty and stocking.
9367523	9374045	You should wear a red zoot suit and have a gun, and he should wear a black suit with the matching wig and have a sword.
9374565	9376126	Only if you go as Garterbelt.
9376206	9380207	He's not even here, and I can just tell you he's side-eyeing you so hard right now.
9380811	9393568	And I will show up as Gardabelt, dammit Alright, we're gonna let you go We'll have Loki show up as Chuck Chuck, Chuck, Chuck I keep saying we're gonna let you go, but then we get questions from chat Frisbee says, weren't you gonna boycott Nintendo?
9394522	9396583	No, not yet, okay?
9396883	9397763	I am holding out.
9398063	9399623	I'm holding out.
9399643	9402504	Nintendo 3DS, Mario Kart 3DS.
9402824	9405685	I am a whore for Mario Kart, okay?
9405925	9406845	That's what I'm waiting for.
9406925	9409726	Frisbee, we all said that night he announced it here on the show.
9409766	9411107	We all said, I give it a week.
9411467	9413267	I think we all said that, and sure enough.
9413747	9415368	God damn you all!
9415768	9417208	Alright, take care, Rama.
9417548	9418329	Alright, later.
9418529	9418789	Bye.
9420590	9422491	Always fun to talk to Ranma here on the show.
9422511	9423552	We are going to close the Skype line.

9436044	9440508	I do play some of those sometimes at the start of the show or what have you, so you can always leave us a voicemail.
9442149	9442410	Anyhow.
9443342	9443842	That's that.
9444063	9446244	We're going to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.
9446644	9448425	But thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and listening.
9449286	9451968	I want to say, of course, before we go, get everybody's final thought.
9452268	9454330	You guys are the reason why we're here every week.
9454710	9455750	Thank you guys for listening.

9460934	9462835	Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9463136	9465777	We would really appreciate it because we're word of mouth.
9465897	9468239	We don't get PR firms that work with it.
9468259	9471001	Well, there's a couple small ones that do, and we are grateful for that.
9471021	9472602	But none of the big, big companies work with it.
9472782	9498663	really want to work with us even though we've been here for nine years but you know we're just we're just a small little dog and pony show but you guys and your word of mouth you help keep this show going and keep it alive and all that so thank you very much let's go around and get everybody's final thought for tonight uh Loki since he's busy playing Child of Eden over there I see what's your final thought tonight that game is awesome it really is awesome I don't know it's I can't wait to play this on HDTV it's really cool
9499389	9501330	Alright, quick impressions there.
9502030	9504552	My final thought tonight is Pinkberry.
9505672	9507053	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
9509774	9510895	You're sick, you can't do it.
9514743	9515864	And off goes your mic.
9516004	9516224	All right.
9518005	9518325	Anyhow.

9520187	9522128	That does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9522168	9526931	We will be back next week to do it all over again with the ninth birthday show.
9526991	9531854	Looks like we are going to have a guest here in studio, someone that's been on the show before but who we always like having on the show.
9532435	9538098	It's going to be a lot about reminiscing in the past next week and just talking about the good old days back in my day.
9538379	9538799	Who knows?
9538919	9543402	Maybe this week DarkSakura and I will go to RVGL just for shits and giggles.
9543642	9544902	No, we'd be going there to cry.
9545103	9545403	All right.
9545743	9546523	Have a good night, everybody.
