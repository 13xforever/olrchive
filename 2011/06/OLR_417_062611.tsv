0	19020	Tonight, June 26, 2011, could the 360 see free to play games?
19020	24180	Xbox brings Kinect functionality to advertisements, and can Silent Hill be scary without Pyramid
24180	31680	Head?
31680	35280	Hello my friends out there on the internet once again, and welcome back to another week
35280	39480	of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39480	42520	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome
42520	48440	co-hosts as I have joined with them for the past nine freaking years.
48440	51120	Say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura, Jamie Sowers.
51120	52520	Who let you in my house?
52520	54280	That's right, I did.
54280	56240	How are you?
56240	58080	I'm recovering.
58080	59080	Recovering from?
59080	60080	Sinus infection.
60080	61080	Oh, I was going to say.
61080	63560	Remember I had a sinus infection last week.
63560	66440	I was going to say it's Pride weekend, so maybe you were recovering from-
66440	68440	I'm recovering from the gay.
68440	69440	All right.
69440	74040	Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki, who is setting up something
74040	75040	tech right now.
75040	76040	What are you doing over there?
76040	77680	You're like getting your, his Xbox.
77680	78680	He's hooking up the Bloom Box.
78680	81840	His Orlando Bloom autographed Xbox.
81840	82840	Why?
82840	83840	Because he could.
83840	84840	Yes.
84840	85840	For no good reason.
85840	86840	What are you going to play on there?
86840	87840	Are you playing Child of Eden again?
87840	88840	I don't know.
88840	89840	I haven't decided yet.
89840	90840	He's just hooking up.
90840	91840	He just wants to play.
91840	92840	Galgun.
92840	93840	He just wants to play games.
93840	94840	Galgun.
94840	95840	I don't want to play Galgun.
95840	96840	We have special guests joining us tonight.
96840	97840	Of course, as always, you guys in chat.
97840	98840	Chat.orangelandre.com.
98840	102560	You join us live and we read your comments here.
102560	103980	It is a show where every gamer has a voice.
103980	107640	We will have the phone lines open later despite that little tease I gave on Bobby's show
107640	108640	beforehand.
108640	109640	We will have the phone lines open later.
109640	113880	And of course, Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Email bag, mailbag, orangelandre.com.
113880	114880	They get it all?
114880	115880	Someone didn't put it on the show roll.
115880	116880	Whatever.
116880	117880	It's not there?
117880	118880	No.
118880	120880	Oh, well, we are doing the mailbag at some point.
120880	123520	When is a mystery to everybody?
123520	127040	Anyhow, let's introduce the guests we have here in studio.
127040	131460	We have some blast from the past here to celebrate nine years of O-L-R with us.
131460	136240	As mentioned on Bobby's show, when you have your 100th episode, your 200th episode, your
136240	143440	five-year episode, you kind of run out of, like, the ego stroking gets a little old.
143440	147520	But we thought, what better way to mark nine years of O-L-R than to invite somebody who's
147520	149200	on a show that's even older.
149200	152520	So say hello to the one and only Jessica Harper is here tonight.
152520	155280	I thought you were going to say, you know, when you're talking about ego stroking, who
155280	157280	better than Jessica Harper?
157280	160640	Is that another word for it?
160640	162800	How are you, Jessica?
162800	163920	I'm doing just fine.
163920	164920	Welcome.
164920	168400	This is, you know, some of the dinner people from back in the day of Maundy Days know you
168400	173920	as Iguana Girl, the queen bee of DDR Freak for quite some time.
173920	174920	Exactly, yeah.
174920	175920	The queen bitch.
175920	179320	But we got all the DDR Freak gossip, you know, a few months ago when you were on the show
179320	180320	last.
180320	182160	So I don't know how much of that we want to revisit.
182160	183600	We'll see how much wine we get in yet.
183600	184840	Yeah, I know.
184840	188000	That's pretty much, but I have to make sure I don't have too much.
188000	192400	But of course, you're here tonight to help plug the Under Sedation Live 10-year anniversary
192400	193400	show is coming up.
193400	196000	It's coming up on July 16th.
196000	200120	We will have 10 years and we'll be sealing Rob away for that night.
200120	203960	So he'll have to have the fun of doing two shows in one week.
203960	207860	Because as you guys may or may not know, I was doing Under Sedation Live back when it
207860	209480	first started back then.
209480	210920	It was before OLR.
210920	215480	OLR was a spinoff of Under Sedation Live in some ways, you know, in some ways, just like
215480	219560	DDR Freak Radio, which again, another blast from the house right there, was a spinoff
219560	221460	of Under Sedation Live.
221460	224600	So we all kind of formed our own stations based off of that station.
224600	229560	Yes, we all hatched out of that egg and somehow we all came out looking like Lady Gaga, our
229560	230560	respective shows.
230560	235180	I came out looking more like Rudall, but I don't know.
235180	239560	Complete with the CGI face on the very odd, all right, anyhow.
239560	242720	As long as you make sure I'm wearing an octopus and have, you know, a big, huge building on
242720	243720	my head, I'm all good.
243720	246880	Wait, are you going for the Ursula look with the octopus?
246880	250200	Exactly, in the building, you know, I have to have the large building.
250200	252560	Which by the way, can I just random tangent?
252560	253560	I was at Disneyland.
253560	257360	I had to go without Alan because, you know, it was just finances being what they were.
257360	259200	But there's two things that Alan loves.
259200	261480	He loves Hello Kitty and he loves Ursula.
261480	263480	And you know what I was able to find at Build-A-Bear?
263480	264480	Hello Kitty Ursula?
264480	266440	A Hello Kitty and I put an Ursula costume on it.
266440	268800	There you go.
268800	269880	And it's the best thing ever.
269880	272400	Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.
272400	273400	That was awesome.
273400	274400	All right.
274400	275400	We will talk video games, I promise.
275400	276400	Oh, and her name is Divine.
276400	277400	Yeah, her name is Divine.
277400	278400	Anyhow.
278400	279400	It's more appropriate.
279400	280400	We'll talk video games in a moment.
280400	282440	But I have to introduce another blast from the past.
282440	289240	And this is somebody who wasn't on Under Sedation Live, but he was on many, many, many early
289240	291120	episodes of Orange Law and Tradeo.
291120	292120	And then he disappeared.
292120	293960	But now he's back.
293960	297560	Say hello everybody to the one and only Intern Drew is back tonight.
297560	298560	Hey, what's up?
298560	300320	You can't keep me away from this place for long.
300320	304440	And still having a little bit of wine right now.
304440	307560	And it's going to affect me far more than it will Jessica.
307560	311560	This is creeping me out because back when the 23rd Magus was on the show back in the
311560	312960	day, you weren't old enough to drink.
312960	313960	I was 17.
313960	314960	Oh my God.
314960	315960	I'm so old.
315960	318580	And now I feel old.
318580	320360	But I've been here for nine years.
320360	322960	He was also shut up with all of that right about now.
322960	324480	He was also our resident young Republican.
324480	329160	From the two females in the room, can we both say shut up?
329160	331960	Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.
331960	337880	And now I'm this is reminding me of my first show because once again, it's actually it's
337880	340320	it's Loki that has the pizza this time.
340320	343480	And I'm the closest to the floor.
343480	346200	So yeah, feeling old and moldy right now.
346200	352000	This reminds me of the first show too because I had a migraine that day.
352000	355120	Just wait for it to be hot in here.
355120	357640	I know it's gonna get hot with all these and the AC is on.
357640	360840	We can turn up the fans on the window open now and we'll figure it out.
360840	361840	All right.
361840	364600	So guys, once again, if you want to join us in our chat room chat about orange lounge
364600	366880	radio dot com, you can join us.
366880	371200	And yeah, join in the party and comment on the shows.
371200	375040	Break Man starts us off saying he left and comes back and is still an intern.
375040	376040	Lol.
376040	377040	Absolutely.
377040	380800	Because as long as he's an intern, we don't have to pay him as she 100.
380800	383840	Matt says, Oh, God, hide your soundboard tables.
383840	387960	That is one of the highlights, I guess you could say, of our history was the night the
387960	388960	23rd Magus.
388960	393280	I'm going to call him that all night long because it's retro, broke the soundboard.
393280	395840	Well, he didn't really break the soundboard, but he, what'd you do?
395840	399520	You leaned up against the card table that soundboard was on and the whole damn thing
399520	402560	just collapsed and we wouldn't get legs knocked off.
402560	406260	Yeah, we went dead for a good 30 seconds and all the chatters are like, Oh, the stream
406260	407260	went down.
407260	408260	I don't get it.
408260	409260	I'm still connected.
409260	410260	You broke the show.
410260	411260	Yeah.
411260	412260	And then it turned out drew broke the show.
412260	416120	They could see that was back when we had the webcam, Justin TV cam and I would hide on
416120	417120	the couch.
417120	418120	That's right.
418120	420320	And we had to be on cam and it was, it was better set up there.
420320	423320	So we had the Justin TV cam back then and the, everybody could see what was happening
423320	426140	on the Justin TV cam, but they couldn't hear it.
426140	427560	So it was funny.
427560	428560	Anyhow.
428560	429600	You know what?
429600	433080	We should actually, we don't have that footage cause we could totally redo it as a silent
433080	434080	picture.
434080	437620	So eat gads, the table has fallen.
437620	443880	So this week on orangelaunchradio.com, our website, Dark Tetsuya, who bless, bless his
443880	444880	heart.
444880	447320	He's like the only person that's actually writing content for the site right now.
447320	450720	And I know I'm thinking I need to make a new year's resolution.
450720	454420	I'm saying a new year of OLRs resolution actually write content for the website because it's
454420	457520	it's we need to get more people visiting orange launch radio.com and posting on our forums
457520	458520	and stuff.
458520	461920	And I think a lot of that comes with content, but a dark Tetsuya had a lot of fun reading
461920	467320	the blast from the past that were on there this week, the where are they now series that
467320	471760	he was doing where, you know, a lot of, a lot of people, and I get not everybody listening
471760	476840	to the podcast now would get it quote unquote, because by the time we were actually in iTunes
476840	481980	as a podcast, we had moved on from being just a show about dance dance revolution and beat
481980	485200	media to DX and the tournament scene and so, so forth and all of that.
485200	488960	So I get a lot of people didn't really follow the scene in those days, but it was kind of
488960	491640	fun to read about what's happened to a lot of those people.
491640	496380	Of course, you can't mention the money culture without get it, stop it.
496380	500000	But one of the people that was interviewed was Jessica, and you can read her article
500000	505240	up on there and see what she's been up to, or she'll just tell us about it tonight.
505240	508560	It's not like it was that much more than you guys already know.
508560	509560	Yeah.
509560	513160	I think actually the last time I was here, you got a heck of a lot more juicy stuff than
513160	515080	you ever possibly could on me.
515080	519000	Well, I know one thing you've done since the last time you were on the show is you actually
519000	521280	went to the place where we all used to hang out.
521280	525360	You went to Roseville Golf Land, which over the years we've called the place where video
525360	530760	games go to die because we've slowly watched this arcade that used to be like our, our
530760	536160	turf, so to speak, just slowly morph into gambling machines for children that spit out
536160	537160	tickets.
537160	538160	Yeah.
538160	539160	And nothing else.
539160	542120	And what did you feel walking into Roseville Golf Land and just kind of seeing it now?
542120	543120	I wanted to cry.
543120	544120	Did you?
544120	545120	I really did.
545120	546680	It was just pathetic.
546680	550960	You walk in and it previously, one of the only reasons why I would still even go there
550960	558120	was because there, there was a 2DX machine for a period of time there, it's gone.
558120	560040	There's still two DDR machines.
560040	564720	They're now in a back corner, tucked away where people like to walk over the pads even
564720	567560	more so than they did when they were prominently displayed towards the middle.
567560	570360	And keep in mind, Roseville Golf Land is also a water park.
570360	574400	So a lot of times during the summer that will be wet feet walking over electronic machines.
574400	575400	Exactly.
575400	576400	Genius people out in Roseville.
576400	582720	Or playing on the machines with their wet feet and leaving all of their water behind.
582720	586400	The only machines that are there, you have an extreme machine.
586400	592280	I'm sorry, Max2 and Disney's Rave.
592280	594040	And that's it for DDR.
594040	598320	And Drummania, there's no drumsticks.
598320	607120	There's a stool that's attached by a big, huge metal chain so that you can't move it.
607120	613080	And the Guitar Freaks controllers were upside down and on the floor when I looked at it.
613080	619040	But oh, of course, they had to have newer style machines.
619040	620040	Everything else was okay.
620040	623120	Plus a big, huge Tetris machine, which I don't understand.
623120	624120	I played that.
624120	625120	Yeah.
625120	626120	That thing's frightening.
626120	627120	And hard to control.
627120	628760	Wait, Tetris is back in the arcade?
628760	629760	What?
629760	630760	It's a huge mungus.
630760	631760	It's a big ball.
631760	632760	What?
632760	633760	I took a picture of it.
633760	634760	The controller's a big ball.
634760	635760	Hold on, let me find my picture of it because I took a picture.
635760	638280	It's a Tetris game that's a giant ball.
638280	642840	Each controller is a huge ball and the screen is like twice my height.
642840	643840	Yeah.
643840	647320	And there's a button on each side of the ball and to move things, you have to move the ball
647320	648760	around with your hands.
648760	651000	It's awkward Tetris.
651000	652000	Awkward Tetris.
652000	653000	That's exactly...
653000	654000	Well, it really is.
654000	655000	It's awkward.
655000	656000	It's hard to play too.
656000	657000	Awkward, phallic Tetris.
657000	658000	No.
658000	660480	With about half the size of the normal amount of lines or actually a third of the amount
660480	661480	of lines that you would normally have.
661480	665440	And it's still kind of hard to get any at all because it's like, oh, you want it here?
665440	669680	Well, we're going to move you one block over because it does not center.
669680	670680	Yeah.
670680	673160	We've got some comments in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com.
673160	674160	Let's see.
674160	676680	SSGA 100 Matt says, every golf land is like that though.
676680	681840	Yeah, but every golf land is not in Roseville and Roseville is a special place because everyone
681840	683120	there is privileged.
683120	684120	Yeah.
684120	689020	Keep in mind that all of these horrible things that are happening to the arcade are complete
689020	695600	opposite as to what's happening to every other portion of the golf land sun splash experience.
695600	699520	You have sun splash, which just keeps on growing and they keep getting more rides.
699520	707560	And now there's this giant two level parking garage area so that everybody and their little
707560	708560	brother can park.
708560	712400	I do appreciate the fact that they have more parking because it was annoying having the
712400	716480	park like in and out in order to make it to sun splash.
716480	717480	You had to hike in.
717480	718480	During summertime, yeah.
718480	719480	Yes.
719480	720480	The rest of the year was no problem.
720480	721480	No.
721480	722480	Here it is.
722480	726280	And see, that's the thing too is they forget, hey, you know, it does get cool at some point
726280	729640	and you can't ride the, you know, slides.
729640	731120	Hey, it's a Sega game.
731120	732240	It's Tetris by Sega.
732240	734000	That's kind of neat.
734000	735120	It's Tetris giant.
735120	736120	Interesting.
736120	741120	And there's the ball and the ball is seriously like the size of my head.
741120	745360	Also in our chat room, uh, chat.orangewonnage.com, the Rob D says, ski ball is also bring your
745360	746520	own ski balls.
746520	750800	Actually, I did play around a ski ball last time I was at our vehicle and you know how
750800	754720	like a bunch of balls are supposed to come down like nine balls, but if the machine is
754720	758440	short and it only give like three balls and then it'll keep refilling.
758440	759440	I had two.
759440	760440	Yeah.
760440	764840	So I had to literally wait after I would throw two balls for, I did play a ski ball while
764840	765840	I was there.
765840	766840	Okay.
766840	771520	Um, the one on the very far left, it would shoot out a bunch of tickets at you, but then
771520	774400	if you, it didn't matter what you scored, there would be no more tickets that would
774400	775400	come out.
775400	780800	Whereas any of the other ones would give you like three initial tickets and then it was
780800	782300	based on score from that point on.
782300	786400	So if you really want, you know, unless you were really, really good at ski ball, you
786400	791760	always want to go to the one on the left because it shoots out something insane like 18 tickets.
791760	794240	Orange Lounge Radio giving you the pro tips.
794240	795240	Exactly.
795240	799420	Well, and the whole reason why I ended up resorting to the little kiddie gambling games
799420	804480	is because I had this card that had something to the tune of about a hundred credits on
804480	805480	it.
805480	806480	And that's right.
806480	807480	They went through the card system.
807480	808680	That's how long it's been since I've gone there.
808680	810480	I think I have tokens still.
810480	815160	Yeah, I think at one point in time I tossed a $20 bill on to get a card so that I could
815160	820320	play 2DX and I played for like an hour that one day and went, oh, I'll just go ahead and
820320	822520	save this card and bring it back for next time.
822520	824400	And this was the next time.
824400	827640	Speaking of which, Rob, do you remember, uh, remember I was going to Dave and Buster's
827640	829080	like the first year we went to E3?
829080	831360	I'm still using that damn card.
831360	833800	Like I don't go there ever.
833800	837720	And I had like, I had to go for the two for one arcade night or whatever it's called.
837720	840840	Um, yes, 23 Maggots.
840840	841840	Stop doing that.
841840	842840	All right.
842840	843840	Drew Nami, intern Drew, whatever.
843840	845560	I, I, I, I grew up, dammit.
845560	847640	I swear to God I grew up just not much.
847640	852640	No, I still have my, uh, my Dave and Buster's card from when I went there the first time
852640	854920	for one of Jamie's birthdays.
854920	856200	Yay.
856200	858560	Like back in the day when I used to go every year.
858560	859560	Yeah.
859560	861760	Back in the day where I still couldn't have a drink.
861760	862880	Oh.
862880	866440	So before we get into our gaming weeks, which is how we're usually supposed to start off
866440	868600	the show, but you know, it's a birthday show.
868600	869600	Just deal.
869600	872920	Uh, I want to talk, cause we were talking about turf and how the Rosewood Golf needs
872920	873920	to be our turf.
873920	877960	But I got to tell you one of my favorite just memories of the past nine years when it comes
877960	884240	to when arcades are actually fun and that would be as ghetto fuck as it is, Scandia
884240	888120	Family Fun Entertainment Center, because I'm just going to say it, we own that fucking
888120	889840	joint for a short period of time.
889840	893520	Oh yeah, we did fucking, that was our turf.
893520	899120	The whole reason is, you know, when you get friendly, when you befriend the game tech,
899120	903880	the game tech manager, then you own everything and that was the only reason why we had such
903880	909360	a good time at Roseville after a while was because he got moved over there and started
909360	910360	working over there.
910360	913340	We're like, Hey, you know, could you put a good word in for the Milwaukee games for us?
913340	919720	But nowhere was it more apparent that we fucking owned Scandia than, than that tournament that
919720	920720	we had there.
920720	924400	The two tournaments, I don't even remember.
924400	925400	We did March Madness.
925400	926400	Okay.
926400	928760	I want to see the other one, which is normally a barrier tournament.
928760	935200	I'm telling you, we monopolized the birthday party room with our room where we were deep
935200	937680	frying Twinkies and selling them.
937680	938680	Why?
938680	944720	Because we know because it sounded funny because Justin B thought it would be a good idea.
944720	945960	The hell ever happened to that kid?
945960	946960	I don't know.
946960	949520	He doesn't use, I think he like remixes remixing stuff.
949520	954000	So we need to get him to one of the songs, one cage match once.
954000	955000	Yeah.
955000	958280	And don't forget that for shaft, the pad broke.
958280	959280	I do.
959280	960280	I do remember that.
960280	964640	And I had to run back home and go get my hard mounted soft pads.
964640	968640	If that tells you how old school this is, kids, there was no such thing as a cobalt
968640	969640	flux back then.
969640	970640	It's hard.
970640	971640	Yeah.
971640	977880	It was my custom hard mounted soft pads that we ended up using for one of the routines
977880	978880	for the competition.
978880	979880	Good times.
979880	982000	I beat my first nine footer on those pads.
982000	983000	Me too, actually.
983000	985480	Or no, my second, I think my second, I think my second was on those pads.
985480	986480	I beat my first nine footer.
986480	990280	But, um, yeah, I mean, and then I remember there was the little gazebo that was out there
990280	995900	before you could go out to the golf course and just, it was all the, you know, Bay area
995900	999480	DER people just took over that place and like families are trying to come in there and stuff
999480	1002240	and we get scared off by the conversation that was going on.
1002240	1005560	I mean, it's just, we, we re we ruled the school there.
1005560	1006560	It was awesome.
1006560	1011000	I'm pulling out with random tunic tunic tunes and yes, except for the batting cages, those
1011000	1012000	we didn't touch.
1012000	1015320	And then you remember like all the bad things that happened to that place, like the time
1015320	1019160	that they took it to the best of Sacramento or something like that and the speakers fell
1019160	1026080	off or the marquee fell off of the thing and they put like boombox speakers up there or
1026080	1027080	something.
1027080	1032560	Although I do remember that we, we had the donated subwoofer for 2DX that would vibrate
1032560	1033560	your knees.
1033560	1034560	Yes.
1034560	1036800	That was awesome.
1036800	1040920	It was great too, is that, um, because we knew the arcade tax, uh, a DDR fourth mix
1040920	1043200	machine would load edits that you made at home.
1043200	1046320	You could actually save a limited number of edits on the machine and he used, he would
1046320	1047320	load our edits.
1047320	1051680	And I remember we had, uh, I, or at least I don't know if me or you, we had an edit
1051680	1058680	for kick the can called big cans, all it was so, so you could fire up big cans and you'd
1058680	1061600	see it on the machine now playing big cans.
1061600	1065440	And what it was is that it would start for like, you know, the song started with this
1065440	1069840	fun little dance for like four measures and it was just a giant break in the song.
1069840	1075160	So people would literally start big cans, play the first four measures, run a lap around
1075160	1084820	the entire arcade and get back just in time to hit that last don't remember that the hell
1084820	1088840	at it competitions too, which I've won lots of good porn that way.
1088840	1091680	Make it, make it and get porn.
1091680	1092680	Yeah, it was awesome.
1092680	1094600	That was one of the, that was one of the early things on OLR.
1094600	1099280	I remember someone, someone passed my hell at it, my DXYM hell at it.
1099280	1102400	That was, it was that skinny kid, Dave.
1102400	1103400	He won.
1103400	1104400	Sign and beat it.
1104400	1105400	He won.
1105400	1110880	When we went on the moderator trip for DDR freak back when sign and beat it, I bought
1110880	1116720	him dinner and we, we, we can't forget the awesomeness that was a chaff that was a Wendell's
1116720	1119000	famous roast beef routine.
1119000	1120220	Yes.
1120220	1124900	And we of course can't forget the travesty that was my attempt at freestyle, which we
1124900	1126640	shall never hear of again.
1126640	1127640	God damn it.
1127640	1132360	Wasn't that the first time I ever did my Dr. Dick character too?
1132360	1133360	Yes.
1133360	1138080	Imagine me doing drag, but not doing drag, that was my Dr. Dick character that I would
1138080	1139080	do.
1139080	1142760	Didn't Dr. Dick eventually though turn into Mr. Spanky?
1142760	1143760	On the, on OLR.
1143760	1146320	So OLR is the spiritual successor to all of that.
1146320	1147920	Like Rob, but gayer.
1147920	1148920	Anyway.
1148920	1149920	All right.
1149920	1150920	Look, we got to get into...
1150920	1151920	There's gayer than Rob?
1151920	1152920	Hey.
1152920	1153920	All right.
1153920	1154920	We got to get into...
1154920	1155920	Oh girl.
1155920	1156920	I'm sorry.
1156920	1158540	That's still supposed to come in a couple of weeks.
1158540	1160440	That's when I get to start attacking you again.
1160440	1161840	I can't wait.
1161840	1162840	I guess I have to play nice.
1162840	1163840	This is a warm up.
1163840	1164840	Warm up.
1164840	1165840	Oh boy.
1165840	1166840	Oh no, no.
1166840	1167840	You can continue.
1167840	1168840	I'm enjoying it.
1168840	1169840	I'll just sit back here and go, writing this down.
1169840	1170840	He's like crap.
1170840	1171940	Now I remember what it was like.
1171940	1176480	So if you think our reminiscing tonight is bad over nine years ago and everything we
1176480	1180960	were doing back then, just wait until next year because I'm telling you, we're renting
1180960	1185880	the Masonic Lodge or something and we're just gonna, we're gonna rule the school and get
1185880	1187360	everybody in one place.
1187360	1190480	Get out all the DDR pads, have like an OLR con or something.
1190480	1192960	That's my dream for a 10th anniversary thing.
1192960	1196480	And get everybody in one roof and just blow the roof off the place.
1196480	1197480	Be fun.
1197480	1198480	Good times.
1198480	1202000	This is our awesome sack anime panel that we did.
1202000	1203000	Yeah.
1203000	1204000	Eight in the morning.
1204000	1205000	About three years ago.
1205000	1208960	Oh, that was so, I think I like had like a double coffee.
1208960	1209960	Literally two people showed up.
1209960	1210960	Yeah, you and one other kid.
1210960	1213840	But you know what I got out of that whole thing?
1213840	1214840	My Dalek.
1214840	1215840	All right.
1215840	1218680	I have that on reserve for you, Jamie.
1218680	1219680	Let's move on guys.
1219680	1223600	Let's get into your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.
1223600	1227440	Nine years later, what are the console games or PC games making up your week?
1227440	1228440	Dark soccer.
1228440	1229440	Wow.
1229440	1230440	Damn it.
1230440	1236920	But I'm actually going to be getting myself a month card for Star Trek online so that
1236920	1242120	my Scottish fleet mates will not keep harassing me.
1242120	1243120	Are they missing you?
1243120	1244120	They miss me.
1244120	1245120	Well, okay.
1245120	1248720	One of my fleet mates is on my Facebook and he's such a nice guy.
1248720	1253040	He's actually the first person that I met in game there that I chatted with other than
1253040	1260880	someone who was actually role playing Captain Jack Harkness from Torchwood, which was gorgeous.
1260880	1265400	But we, we, we just ended up chatting and we were the same level and we kept playing
1265400	1269760	and then he got me into the fleet and I was like, Ooh, I get to listen to Scottish men's.
1269760	1271000	That's awesome.
1271000	1277600	So I might be getting a month on STO before the fun's going to dry.
1277600	1278600	All right.
1278600	1280680	So thinking about more MMOs to go play.
1280680	1282680	Initial D extreme stage.
1282680	1286260	We're going to have news later on tonight about a pretty big MMO that is going free
1286260	1287460	to play.
1287460	1289960	So I'm curious if that's going to be something you're going to want to go to as well.
1289960	1293160	It'd be interesting to see just free MMOs are good.
1293160	1299040	Except for Ragnarok online, which I played for what, nine years in various forms of,
1299040	1303300	well, when I started playing, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1303300	1306620	When I started playing, I started on the Korean beta.
1306620	1311980	So I was playing on the Korean servers for free because it was in beta.
1311980	1315080	And then I played on the Japanese servers when they kicked us out of the Korean servers.
1315080	1317600	And then I played on the American servers when we finally got them.
1317600	1319980	And I played all the way up until it went pay to play.
1319980	1321840	And then I actually started paying for it.
1321840	1327800	And then I went to private servers because the mods were jerk faces and would do random
1327800	1329080	attacks on the towns.
1329080	1330080	Yeah.
1330080	1331080	I remember that.
1331080	1332080	You dragged my ass into it.
1332080	1333080	I couldn't leave town.
1333080	1334080	Yeah.
1334080	1335080	You can't leave town because you'll just...
1335080	1336080	Oh, dead.
1336080	1337080	Oh, because it was Halloween.
1337080	1338080	Ooh.
1338080	1339080	Oop, dead.
1339080	1340080	That's fun.
1340080	1341080	Walk alone.
1341080	1342800	And then the whole thing is like, oh, you're walking alone.
1342800	1343800	Oop, dead.
1343800	1344800	We're putting a random mob there.
1344800	1345800	Yeah.
1345800	1346800	How about no?
1346800	1347800	Yeah.
1347800	1348800	So no more RO for me.
1348800	1349800	All right.
1349800	1350800	Well, let's go over...
1350800	1351800	Oh.
1351800	1352800	One more thing.
1352800	1353800	Okay.
1353800	1355000	Lots of peggle in WoW.
1355000	1360200	Because I've been sitting my ass in queue for 35 minutes a pop because I like DPS too
1360200	1361200	much.
1361200	1362200	Done.
1362200	1363200	All right.
1363200	1364200	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1364200	1365200	It was okay.
1365200	1366200	I didn't play a whole lot this week.
1366200	1371600	I played, let's see, some more Child of Eden, which is, it's pretty awesome.
1371600	1374080	I actually got to play it on the HGTV this time.
1374080	1378700	It does get quite difficult when you're using the controller, like about even like the third
1378700	1380840	level in or whatever.
1380840	1383080	So I'm actually looking forward to trying it with the Kinect.
1383080	1388640	I think it'll be a lot more accurate.
1388640	1393080	Played a bit of Shadows of the Damned, which is a very strange game.
1393080	1396120	And there's lots of penis references all throughout the game.
1396120	1400440	Just the entire fucking game is just penis references.
1400440	1401440	But it's cool.
1401440	1403960	Where can I buy this game?
1403960	1405960	At your local store.
1405960	1406960	It's basically Suda51.
1406960	1409140	I mean, well, there you go.
1409140	1410140	That's why.
1410140	1411140	It's all crazy.
1411140	1418560	Suda51, the guy that created Resident Evil, and Akira Yamaoka doing the soundtrack.
1418560	1419840	It's pretty awesome, though.
1419840	1426320	It's kind of a third person action game where your girlfriend gets, you're a demon hunter
1426320	1428720	and your girlfriend gets killed.
1428720	1435360	And basically this demon lord takes her into hell and you have to go after him.
1435360	1440200	And they're calling it a road, was it like a road trip movie in hell.
1440200	1442520	We actually have a clip from the game.
1442520	1444600	This is Shadows of the Damned.
1444600	1446960	This is a clip actually from the Akira Yamaoka soundtrack.
1446960	1450400	I know a lot of you have been eagerly anticipating hearing some of the soundtrack.
1450400	1451400	Here you go.
1451400	1454840	Gentlemen, here's a little number I tossed off recently in the Caribbean.
1454840	1457760	Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?
1457760	1460480	Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong?
1460480	1461760	It's swell to have a stiffy.
1461760	1463320	It's divine to own a dick.
1463320	1467000	From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick.
1467000	1469560	So three cheers for your Willie or John Thomas.
1469560	1475120	Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake, your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your
1475120	1480280	pussy or your cock, you can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock, but
1480280	1484440	don't take it out in public or they will stick you in the dock and you won't.
1484440	1485440	Come back.
1485440	1487160	Thank you very much.
1487160	1488160	There you go.
1488160	1489160	That's Akira Yamaoka.
1489160	1491160	It's a weird direction he's going in now with his music.
1491160	1492400	You know what, Rob?
1492400	1498880	I used to, it was me and a bunch of my friends would go to the one Denny's in Mobile, Alabama
1498880	1505480	and sing this as loud as we could around 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock after we were done doing
1505480	1510240	whatever it was that we little degenerates were doing, you know, like there's shit to
1510240	1512080	do in Mobile, Alabama.
1512080	1514240	Except play live action vampire.
1514240	1515240	LARP.
1515240	1516240	LARP.
1516240	1520400	Naturally you pick the Denny's because that shit will get you kicked out of Waffle House.
1520400	1522600	Yeah, that will get you kicked out of Waffle House.
1522600	1532600	You laugh at that rendition of that song there, but actually your gun, which is Johnson, yes,
1532600	1537560	he keeps referring to as Johnson the entire time, actually the voice is very similar.
1537560	1544360	All right, so you've been playing Penis of the Damned and what, two penises up or?
1544360	1545360	It's awesome.
1545360	1546360	It's a pretty fun game.
1546360	1549600	I'm actually looking forward to, no, I'm never going to finish this game.
1549600	1550600	You know why?
1550600	1551600	Because Earth Defense Force.
1551600	1556680	So, Insect Armageddon is going to be coming out, not next week, but the week after.
1556680	1559640	But hey, you know what, I don't know if I can get it early.
1559640	1561680	And that's all I'll be playing at the end of this next week.
1561680	1566240	So I don't care about finishing this game or anything else because this game will take
1566240	1567240	over my life.
1567240	1568240	Great.
1568240	1569920	So when we ask you about your gaming week for the next six months, it's going to be,
1569920	1571080	ah, I played Insect Armageddon.
1571080	1574020	What if, what if, what if, what if it sucks?
1574020	1575020	It's going to suck.
1575020	1576720	The first game sucked, but it was fun.
1576720	1577720	That was the whole point.
1577720	1581480	Rob, let's just give you the complete view of that game right away.
1581480	1583240	Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.
1583240	1584240	There.
1584240	1585240	That's your review.
1585240	1586240	Thank you.
1586240	1587240	Somebody, somebody crop me a sound clip of that.
1587240	1588240	There's actually, um.
1588240	1589240	When he moves.
1589240	1590240	There's some weird shit in there.
1590240	1594800	Like, for example, you go, you have to shoot goat heads in order to get light to show,
1594800	1595960	um, show up.
1595960	1598240	And also, uh, there's these baby faces.
1598240	1600800	You have to feed giant strawberries and eyeballs too.
1600800	1602520	Oh, fun.
1602520	1604720	I want this game.
1604720	1605720	It's pretty awesome.
1605720	1606720	All right.
1606720	1610560	Uh, I believe your husband will have it soon.
1610560	1611560	Really?
1611560	1612560	Wow.
1612560	1613560	You're a profit.
1613560	1615280	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1615280	1617120	Uh, Grand Theft Auto.
1617120	1618120	All right.
1618120	1622040	Almost, almost made it a whole week where I was just on a winning streak the entire
1622040	1623040	week.
1623040	1627800	I did lose one game in the middle of there and I was out today, so I'll try next week.
1627800	1628800	I know.
1628800	1631400	It's, it's, it's this, sorry, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.
1631400	1633980	Uh, this is this, this is like bubble wrap.
1633980	1637720	It's like the world's biggest bubble wrap, but you can't pop the bubbles.
1637720	1642400	So I keep sitting here trying to pop the bubbles on this world's biggest bubble wrap and they
1642400	1647320	don't, they don't pop just don't, if you rip into it, that's cheating.
1647320	1648760	You can't use your nails.
1648760	1650520	I could pop it, but I'm all right.
1650520	1656840	I don't want to ruin that piece of any house that can ruin that piece of bubble wrap.
1656840	1657840	This is great radio.
1657840	1660520	The sound of no, no, no, no, no, that's cheating.
1660520	1661520	That is cheating with scissors.
1661520	1662520	All right.
1662520	1663520	My house.
1663520	1664520	I can cheat.
1664520	1665520	Can you picture that and put it on the website?
1665520	1670760	So at least there's some, all you would have had to do is just roll it up into a ball and
1670760	1671760	it would have worked.
1671760	1674000	I don't see why twisting it would be cheating though.
1674000	1677960	All right, Jessica, I know you don't, Oh my gosh, she got one.
1677960	1678960	That's what I said.
1678960	1679960	You twist it.
1679960	1680960	Wow.
1680960	1683880	All right, Jessica, I know you don't just play DDR.
1683880	1684880	I play DDR.
1684880	1687800	You know why I won't do?
1687800	1690220	Because look at it, it's not just one bubble.
1690220	1691220	It's multi-bubble.
1691220	1692960	Enough with the bubble wrap.
1692960	1694720	We're playing, you know, a game right now.
1694720	1696920	I was trying to understand the physics behind it, Rob.
1696920	1698920	Don't you ever watch Mr. Wizard's World?
1698920	1699920	Don't you ever want to know?
1699920	1700920	He's dead, Jamie.
1700920	1701920	And he hated children.
1701920	1710200	Anyway, Jessica, how was your gaming week?
1710200	1716900	I played what I always play, lots and lots and lots of lotro and lots and lots of lotro
1716900	1717900	and more lotro.
1717900	1720920	Dude, what is it with chicks and MMOs?
1720920	1723920	Okay, dealer.
1723920	1728720	It's funny you guys were talking about the whole, you know, free MMO thing because lotro
1728720	1731880	is a free MMO, though I am a subscriber.
1731880	1735220	And I think it was a good thing for them to do because they brought in a lot of people
1735220	1739280	and it was because of bringing in those people that they gained more of an audience for their
1739280	1740280	subscriptions.
1740280	1741280	So.
1741280	1748840	Out of curiosity, when lotro went free to play, did a lot of the existing fan base say,
1748840	1752320	we're going to reject these free people and this is going to be horrible and we don't
1752320	1754560	want new people coming into our turf?
1754560	1756320	Like was it received with a bunch of negativity?
1756320	1758360	Well, I wasn't on at that point in time.
1758360	1764000	I came in a little bit after that, but I did, I do hear even to this day, oh, well, everything
1764000	1768880	changed when we went free to play, you know, the types of people that were playing now
1768880	1773280	are completely different and so hard to, you know, and I can understand that, you know,
1773280	1778800	you're going to end up with a lot more of a crowd that is flaky.
1778800	1782440	If people have their money, you know, put into a game, then yeah, they're a little bit
1782440	1785000	more indebted to, they're going to, they're going to play it more often.
1785000	1786840	Just makes sense.
1786840	1792480	That said, I too have a Star Trek online account that I pay for monthly that just sits there
1792480	1795440	with my level 10 Lieutenant Commander.
1795440	1799840	So it's, you know, it doesn't really matter all the time.
1799840	1802400	You're still going to have the same type of flaky people.
1802400	1803940	It's I don't know.
1803940	1806160	It's topical because it's something else going on this week.
1806160	1807160	That's why I asked.
1807160	1812600	But the main thing is we're getting ready right now for Isengard is going to be the
1812600	1814000	next update in September.
1814000	1818340	So everybody's doing their pre-purchase and you get your snazzy stuff, like your snazzy
1818340	1821840	horse or your snazzy outfit and everything.
1821840	1826960	But the one thing I like is I get a 25% XP buff on any of my characters that are below
1826960	1828540	the level cap.
1828540	1833640	And for me, who's right there, just barely below the level cap, that helps gives me that
1833640	1834640	little extra push.
1834640	1835640	Awesome.
1835640	1837680	Will that bring you up?
1837680	1838680	Huh?
1838680	1839680	Will that bring you up to the level?
1839680	1841880	Well, no, I'm still working on it.
1841880	1847720	It's just a 25% extra buff so that you're gaining 25% more XP per kill.
1847720	1850200	Plus on top of it, we're in the middle of the summer festival.
1850200	1853700	So you automatically are getting a buff from that as well on XP.
1853700	1860240	So any kills that I've made this weekend are basically just, I'm getting mad, mad XP from.
1860240	1861240	Cool.
1861240	1865960	Let me ask this because Lord of the Rings really isn't big in pop culture right now.
1865960	1869340	I mean, it was a few years ago when the movies were coming out, but obviously it's always
1869340	1870760	going to have its fan base.
1870760	1874440	But the reason why I say that is because we have these Hobbit movies that are on the horizon.
1874440	1876760	We're hearing more about that.
1876760	1879920	That's going to kind of bring more attention back in pop culture to the all things Lord
1879920	1881740	of the Rings and Tolkien and all that.
1881740	1885400	So how do you think the MMO will be impacted by the Hobbit?
1885400	1890840	Oh, I would not be surprised if you would end up seeing a huge surge of people that
1890840	1893160	were going to start joining after that.
1893160	1898200	On top of that, we're also seeing a lot of people right now because movie theaters all
1898200	1905160	across the country are showing the original movies on big screen one night per week.
1905160	1909480	So last week they did the original, now they're doing Two Towers this week, and next week's
1909480	1910480	going to be...
1910480	1912040	Yeah, Dan's going to that on Tuesday.
1912040	1913040	Yeah.
1913040	1916220	So that in and of itself is getting a lot more interest.
1916220	1919520	So I look forward to it.
1919520	1927260	The kinship that I'm a part of is very newbie friendly and we like to be able to help each
1927260	1932240	other kind of move on in the game and we welcome anybody no matter if they're paid to play
1932240	1934760	or not in our kinship.
1934760	1936760	So yay, go Arlequins.
1936760	1937760	Yay.
1937760	1939320	It's very warm and fuzzy and friendly.
1939320	1940320	And it helps too.
1940320	1946560	It helps too because not only do I have two of my old coworkers in my kinship, the leader
1946560	1951160	is somebody that I knew from IRC that I met like way back in the day.
1951160	1955840	So it's really kind of spiffy that I get to have that kind of connection with two completely
1955840	1958000	different portions of my life at the same time.
1958000	1959000	Awesome.
1959000	1960000	MMOs, bringing people together.
1960000	1961000	There you go.
1961000	1962000	All right.
1962000	1965080	Drunami, anything you want to say about your gaming week and what you've been playing?
1965080	1969660	I've been playing a bunch of the WoW crack and not really encountering those insane queue
1969660	1972320	times because I play a healer.
1972320	1973320	But I can understand.
1973320	1974320	What kind of healer are you?
1974320	1978480	I main a priest, but I'm starting up a shaman lately.
1978480	1979480	You're a 40, right?
1979480	1980480	Holy Pally's the best.
1980480	1981480	Yeah.
1981480	1986360	I never really got into the Holy Pally stuff, but aside from that, I've been playing a lot
1986360	1997360	of Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War 2, Retribution, Electric Boogaloo over too many subtitles.
1997360	2003320	And speaking of games that have gone free to play or have been free to play for a while,
2003320	2007120	Steam kind of kicked off some stuff and I kind of got into making a Champions Online
2007120	2010560	character trying to get into the whole Silver Age thing.
2010560	2016160	I'm like, yeah, I heard Champions Online kind of tepid, like a lot of people weren't really
2016160	2017160	into it when it first came out.
2017160	2019960	Then it went free to play and suddenly way more people were into it.
2019960	2020960	I was in the beta.
2020960	2021960	It got better.
2021960	2022960	It got better.
2022960	2023960	Not great, but it got better.
2023960	2027320	But I started up a grimoire named 23.
2027320	2028320	Derp.
2028320	2029320	Numerologist.
2029320	2030320	Yay.
2030320	2034760	And a lot of people too with that game forget that they were going to put that on 360 and
2034760	2037200	then at the last minute, it just didn't end up happening.
2037200	2040480	But it's funny because if you plug in an Xbox 360, Alan told me about this, you plug in
2040480	2042800	a 360 controller, it will show.
2042800	2043800	It works.
2043800	2045920	Yeah, everything shows up with the Xbox buttons and everything.
2045920	2047720	But not very well.
2047720	2048720	I tried.
2048720	2052760	I actually had to struggle to get it not to recognize 360 control and let me use the damn
2052760	2059080	keyboard because I have my controller plugged in all the time.
2059080	2063280	But aside from that, you know, wow, Dawn of War, Champions Online, I haven't really been
2063280	2064280	playing much.
2064280	2069600	I've been thinking about getting back into playing some Wii games I'd set on the shelf.
2069600	2072120	Playing through No More Heroes 2 again.
2072120	2077400	And just kind of going through my game archive stuff I hadn't finished.
2077400	2078400	Rogue Galaxy.
2078400	2079480	That's what I'm doing right now.
2079480	2081520	Shadow Hearts from the New World.
2081520	2084640	Just some older PS2 stuff because I'm a broke ass like that.
2084640	2085640	Alright.
2085640	2086960	Well, there you go.
2086960	2089720	Lots of archive gaming and free gaming.
2089720	2095800	Yeah, also scaring the crap out of myself with Dead Space but that's another story altogether.
2095800	2097840	Let's see, my gaming week quickly and then we'll get into the gaming news.
2097840	2100600	I actually don't have a lot to add to my gaming week this week.
2100600	2102340	It's really the same games.
2102340	2105920	It's funny because I've been gaming a lot but I have nothing new to share with you all
2105920	2109120	because I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 13.
2109120	2113200	I'm finally to the point where the game has opened up and if you've played through 13
2113200	2115920	you know exactly what point of the game I'm talking about.
2115920	2119960	You know, that took many, many hours to get there but I'm actually really into it and
2119960	2122260	again, I don't get the 13 hate.
2122260	2124600	This is seriously one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.
2124600	2126680	I like it more Nate, that's for sure.
2126680	2128400	So I'm having a great time with it.
2128400	2130440	So I am going to play it through to completion.
2130440	2137500	That is because even though yes, some of the characters are just so cliche and annoying,
2137500	2141920	I really, really have a boner for Fang who is an amazing character.
2141920	2142920	Love her.
2142920	2144160	So, strong woman.
2144160	2145160	Like her.
2145160	2147600	I'm like, I'm just playing for Fang at this point.
2147600	2148600	She's great.
2148600	2149600	And I like lightning too.
2149600	2151160	Is that Fang service?
2151160	2152160	Yes.
2152160	2154040	It's Fang service.
2154040	2156000	I see Drunami is rubbing off on you.
2156000	2157000	All right.
2157000	2158000	Anyhow.
2158000	2159000	He's sitting next to me.
2159000	2160000	I'm getting infected.
2160000	2161000	Anyhow.
2161000	2162000	Also, you know, Warcraft.
2162000	2166720	Mortal Kombat played online for a little bit with Extrofer from the other show Horde House.
2166720	2169600	I was playing, yes, he's really getting into Mortal Kombat.
2169600	2170600	It's really funny.
2170600	2172440	Like he's almost beat story mode, I think.
2172440	2173840	So we were sparring a little bit.
2173840	2178640	So that was fun because I like playing with Extrofer because like I know who it is and
2178640	2182720	it's not just some anonymous face who is kicking my ass.
2182720	2184440	But Extrofer and I are pretty evenly matched.
2184440	2186060	So it's actually kind of fun to play him online.
2186060	2189360	So I'm thankful to like no more people playing Mortal Kombat online.
2189360	2192000	So otherwise, nothing really new to share.
2192000	2193400	Hopefully in the coming weeks I will.
2193400	2197000	I actually have some racing games sitting at home that came from my rental service that
2197000	2198000	I'm waiting to play.
2198000	2202280	So I'm hoping I'll have a Need for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited 2 things to say in the
2202280	2204600	coming weeks because I have both of those sitting at home.
2204600	2208200	I want to know who the fuck Penis Man is.
2208200	2214180	Again, one of those sound clips I'd like to save to a sound board and use on a rainy day
2214180	2215180	sometime.
2215180	2219040	Chat.orangelandre.com if you would like to offend Dark Soccer with your name.
2219040	2220760	It's Break Man.
2220760	2225760	Anyhow, let's move on to, we're going to get into gaming news, but first some housekeeping
2225760	2226760	tonight.
2226760	2227760	Good lord, it's been nine years.
2227760	2232000	If you haven't already, you really should follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R
2232000	2236600	and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2236600	2239680	And yeah, please join us on those sites.
2239680	2244280	And of course, I want to plug one more time, Jess Carper is here tonight to help plug Under
2244280	2248740	Sedation Live, which is the show that was before Orange Lounge Radio, it was actually
2248740	2249740	on that show.
2249740	2251680	That was a show born of the Rocky Horror community.
2251680	2253760	I don't think a lot of people know that.
2253760	2257520	But that was a show, like this was born of DDR, that show was born of Rocky Horror and
2257520	2263880	now it's kind of all things sci-fi geekery what the fuck every plus video games tossed
2263880	2264880	in there too.
2264880	2265880	Yes.
2265880	2266880	Plus, and then video games tossed in there too.
2266880	2272560	So and of course, under station lives on Saturday nights at eight o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock
2272560	2273560	Eastern.
2273560	2274560	So it's a late show.
2274560	2275560	Yes.
2275560	2276560	And the website.
2276560	2281600	It's understationlive.org and Travis actually just revamped the entire website this week.
2281600	2285020	And on top of that, he just updated all of the podcasts.
2285020	2292880	So now everything is up there, up to week before last.
2292880	2297600	He didn't do last week's because it was a solo show because I was out and about.
2297600	2300960	So yeah, basically everything through episode 36 is up on the web.
2300960	2301960	Great.
2301960	2303960	Because I need to catch up because, you know, it's tough.
2303960	2307480	With having this show on Sunday night, Saturday night, it's usually my night to, you know,
2307480	2308480	go do stuff.
2308480	2311640	Oh, you will definitely want to, I think 35 or 36.
2311640	2312640	Definitely.
2312640	2313640	All right.
2313640	2317080	So we're doing some pre-ten year anniversary reminiscing.
2317080	2318080	Oh boy.
2318080	2319080	All right.
2319080	2320080	All right.
2320080	2321080	I'll have to check that out.
2321080	2323080	And then of course the 10 year anniversary show is July 16th.
2323080	2324080	Right?
2324080	2325080	Yes.
2325080	2326080	All right.
2326080	2328080	Did you kidnap a child?
2328080	2329080	Okay.
2329080	2330080	All right.
2330080	2336840	Anyhow, let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.
2336840	2338380	Loki.
2338380	2345160	So Monday, this is coming up Monday, there's going to be some stuff going down in California.
2345160	2350840	The case Brown versus EMA, which is formerly Schwarzenegger versus EMA, involving California's
2350840	2358720	attempt to enforce a law written by, thank you, Leland Yee, a Democrat representing San
2358720	2364380	Francisco in 2005, that would criminalize the sale of hyper violent games to kids.
2364380	2369000	It's not necessarily all M rated games, but only certain types of games as defined by
2369000	2370000	the law.
2370000	2378800	These new games would need to be labeled specially and carry a thousand dollar fine to those
2378800	2383100	who are found violation of the law, selling those games to minors.
2383100	2387720	And it says, if the court rules for California, it will be overturning a half decades worth
2387720	2392480	of decisions in lower courts that said California's law violated first amendment protections of
2392480	2396920	freedom of speech.
2396920	2403000	Apparently also, it doesn't necessarily mean if the court decides that it's against the
2403000	2404000	first amendment.
2404000	2406800	It says they could still direct the state in how to write the law that would criminalize
2406800	2412560	the sale of games to kids without violating the constitution.
2412560	2413560	I don't know.
2413560	2417600	So basically, if they win, they're going to separate video games from music, movies, and
2417600	2423280	books and all their forms of entertainment, singling them out, preventing them from going
2423280	2427000	to be sold for minors and stuff like that.
2427000	2428000	Okay.
2428000	2429000	What?
2429000	2432560	Dark soccer is saying, is this more important than a Supreme court hearing on video games
2432560	2434120	to change the way we buy games?
2434120	2435120	Yes, it is.
2435120	2436120	I'm dying to hear this.
2436120	2437120	It's cake.
2437120	2442400	Oh, birthday to you.
2442400	2446640	Happy birthday dear Rob.
2446640	2449640	Happy birthday to you.
2449640	2450640	Thank you guys.
2450640	2451640	Yeah.
2451640	2452640	It's my birthday too.
2452640	2453640	Not just the shows.
2453640	2454640	I have to make a wish.
2454640	2455640	Yes.
2455640	2456640	Okay.
2456640	2459440	I'm going to, Oh, do I get, do I have to say my wish or do I have to keep a secret?
2459440	2462440	You can tell us after the show.
2462440	2466920	One, two, way to blow Rob.
2466920	2467920	He sure knows how to blow.
2467920	2469920	He's gone from suck to blow.
2469920	2470920	Yay.
2470920	2473200	I blew them all out.
2473200	2474200	Yay.
2474200	2475200	Thank you for not setting the cake on fire.
2475200	2484360	I appreciate that because there are not 30 candles on that cake, there's far less.
2484360	2487120	I'll get plates while he finishes the story.
2487120	2488120	That's told you.
2488120	2489120	All right.
2489120	2490360	And that's, that's not a Bel Air cake.
2490360	2491480	That is a homemade cake.
2491480	2494200	Becky's made the icing and everything from scratch.
2494200	2495200	That's great.
2495200	2496200	Yeah.
2496200	2497200	Thank you so much.
2497200	2498200	Thank you, Becky.
2498200	2499200	All right.
2499200	2500200	Isn't she sneaky?
2500200	2501200	Anyhow.
2501200	2505080	Um, so yeah, it's, it sucks and hopefully it doesn't pass cause I mean, seriously, I,
2505080	2508880	there's enough reasons to hate the government in California.
2508880	2514120	We don't need them to be, and Leland Yee, seriously, this guy has a hard on for like
2514120	2521760	writing terrible laws that involve, you know, protecting the children.
2521760	2522760	What douche.
2522760	2524760	Chatters want a picture.
2524760	2525760	Sorry.
2525760	2529680	I was yelling that I was relaying for the chat room that they wanted a picture.
2529680	2534120	You know, all, all that neutering, just all, all, all that, that, that happy just neutered
2534120	2535120	my rant.
2535120	2536120	I know.
2536120	2537120	Right.
2537120	2539640	It's like, I wanted to say a lot of angry things, but how can I be mad?
2539640	2541080	Someone baked me a cake.
2541080	2545800	Um, but seriously, what, what the hell is this supposed to solve?
2545800	2550400	Ignorant parents are still going to buy their kids and rated games and not worry about it.
2550400	2554080	Drew, I kind of feel like this discussion is like Pat, I mean, I'm not invalidating
2554080	2556920	your point, but it's like, it's kind of like, there's nothing we can do about this now.
2556920	2564800	The reality is tomorrow is a huge day because, and what I'm reminded of is other news that
2564800	2568240	came out, it was here this week or last week about cigarette label warnings are supposed
2568240	2574680	to get even bigger and like more either like the Canadian warnings now or like in Canada,
2574680	2577680	you buy the pack of smokes and it shows like the decayed lungs and all that stuff.
2577680	2581120	And it's like, okay, we get the point, God, you know, it's, it's, it's the same point
2581120	2584320	where both of them, what the hell is this going to change?
2584320	2587400	It's not, people who smoke are still going to smoke.
2587400	2590880	Parents who ignorantly buy, you know, buy all these, these video games for their kids
2590880	2594920	are still going to, and stores are already enforcing this stuff anyways.
2594920	2600120	I mean, all they're going to do is just add another, like a fine to this and it's just
2600120	2601800	going to screw people out of that.
2601800	2605880	And then also on top of that, the government's got to decide, okay, which ones are, you know,
2605880	2606880	really obscene.
2606880	2611360	And if these have seen games or whatever are marketed as such, then certain stores may
2611360	2616800	not carry them, you know, to keep their family friendly appearance, period, end of story
2616800	2618800	should be done the same as movies.
2618800	2621080	Why can't it just mirror movies?
2621080	2623640	Because that would make these are interactive, Rob.
2623640	2627480	You have to understand people are playing the role of the killer instead of watching
2627480	2628480	the killer brutally.
2628480	2635280	You know, I have a hard time believing that the penis game is worse for kids than the
2635280	2636280	human centipede.
2636280	2638880	I'm sorry.
2638880	2640720	Or any of the saw movies.
2640720	2645800	They can't be consistent because that would actually make sense.
2645800	2647960	And they lose their jobs if they actually make sense.
2647960	2651240	It's all about trying to get a platform so he gets voted in or something like that.
2651240	2654040	I don't even know what the point of this is.
2654040	2661200	I it's, are they saying, are legal analysts trying to predict this one way or the other?
2661200	2663920	Does anybody have a reading on how, which way this is going to go?
2663920	2668360	They figured that the way that this is, this law's gone in other States, it's not going
2668360	2669360	to pass.
2669360	2672160	You know, and then here's the best thing apart.
2672160	2679840	The best part about it is it's our tax money that the state is using to fight this thing.
2679840	2682320	Thanks.
2682320	2683320	I want a refund.
2683320	2686640	Uh, go into our chatroom at chat.ownerswannabe.com.
2686640	2689160	Rama in our chatroom says the stores do not enforce it.
2689160	2695640	I've seen 16 year olds buy M rated games and the cashiers just hit the bypass keys.
2695640	2701160	McMahon in chat says these new cigarette warning labels make me want to smoke.
2701160	2703000	Well that's not having the intended effect then.
2703000	2708600	I really am.
2708600	2715640	I think I like how they handle it in, in England where movies and games have the same reading
2715640	2716640	system.
2716640	2717640	I'm so with you.
2717640	2718640	I'm so with you.
2718640	2722360	Just give games the exact, I mean, I guess we're kind of past the point of no return
2722360	2723440	so to speak.
2723440	2726440	Like we've already had this rating system that's been established in place for years.
2726440	2728760	It's not that difficult to understand the rating system though.
2728760	2733520	I mean, how, how much more do we need to, I mean, it's, I don't think it's necessarily
2733520	2739440	that, you know, these people, um, these people don't know what the rating system is or that
2739440	2740440	these games are violent.
2740440	2742220	I think they just don't care.
2742220	2746160	It's just like, oh, I don't care if I get cancer from smoking or I don't care if I,
2746160	2748720	you know, get liver damage from drinking.
2748720	2750340	They just don't care.
2750340	2756320	And no amount of laws and stickers and banners and, you know, campaigns and whatever are
2756320	2758960	going to get these people to care anymore.
2758960	2763360	Unless you say, oh, you bought this for your child, we're going to fine you a thousand
2763360	2764360	dollars.
2764360	2768880	Then, you know, the immortal words of Bill Murray, it just doesn't matter.
2768880	2771560	Or, uh, how about Dennis Leary?
2771560	2772560	It's a drug.
2772560	2773760	We're addicted.
2773760	2778080	Some not very encouraging words from Black Wolf in the chat room saying, Sky, the mock
2778080	2782480	trials that some law school schools have done said that the Supreme Court will side with
2782480	2783480	California.
2783480	2785200	Well, then they're dumb.
2785200	2786200	I'm sorry.
2786200	2787200	Then that's sad.
2787200	2791360	We're at a really sad state is if they single this out, then, then they need to fight this.
2791360	2795020	They need to appeal it and they need to fight it because it's the Supreme Court, Loki.
2795020	2796720	You can't appeal that it is.
2796720	2800520	There is no, there is no court higher in the land than the Supreme Court period.
2800520	2801520	I'm sorry though.
2801520	2806840	But you're singling, basically you're restricting the freedom of expression because you're restricting
2806840	2811920	the sale of these certain games, which have not even been proven to cause any harm to
2811920	2812920	children anyways.
2812920	2816120	The crime rate's actually decreased since the Super Nintendo came out.
2816120	2821760	So there's, there's no, it's not like, you know, smoking or, that's a pretty easy distinction.
2821760	2823840	You're talking about all hypothetical stuff.
2823840	2829760	We don't, there's no, like playing a violent video game doesn't make me catch on fire or,
2829760	2831920	you know, doesn't make my lungs deteriorate.
2831920	2834080	It's just a game.
2834080	2838880	Loki, welcome to America, home of unnecessary moral panic.
2838880	2841000	It was like this for D&D.
2841000	2842760	It was like that for Doom.
2842760	2843760	It's going to continue.
2843760	2848080	And how many of us who were raised on D&D are sacrificing chickens in the backyard?
2848080	2849080	Don't check my backyard, Jamie.
2849080	2850080	I swear to God.
2850080	2851080	Here's my thing.
2851080	2855360	If, if this comes down tomorrow and it doesn't go the way we think it should, you know, the,
2855360	2860660	the only way you can quote unquote retaliate is with your vote and stop voting for people
2860660	2863200	that are going to shove moral righteousness down our throat.
2863200	2864680	Who is voting for Lee Lin Yi?
2864680	2866360	San Francisco, I blame you.
2866360	2867800	This is all your damn fault.
2867800	2868800	You and his sister?
2868800	2869800	I thought he was SoCal.
2869800	2870800	No, he's San Francisco.
2870800	2871800	He's San Francisco.
2871800	2872800	And guess what?
2872800	2876960	You know, this is the same type of shit that they passed over there was they were banning
2876960	2881760	toys from Happy Meals because that'll get people to stop buying fast food for their
2881760	2883320	children.
2883320	2885400	Yeah.
2885400	2887800	No people not being stupid will do that.
2887800	2892140	Well, San Francisco's also got the whole thing about, what is it, they want to ban circumcision
2892140	2893140	or something like that.
2893140	2897760	So yeah, listen, San Francisco, you're already fucking strange enough as it is, you know,
2897760	2902920	you don't really, there are other things we need to legislate, but, but then you go, well,
2902920	2908640	everybody that's going to, you do that, that's going to start coming into line with, um,
2908640	2914280	uh, uh, with religious tolerance groups because the, um, the anti-defamation league has already
2914280	2915280	gotten in on that.
2915280	2917960	Well, and then here, but then here's the other thing on the other side of the coin.
2917960	2920160	So you, you look at these things that San Francisco is doing, you kind of roll your
2920160	2925500	eyes, but at the same time, everybody in San Francisco has healthcare and whether you're
2925500	2930160	a fan of socialized healthcare or not, you have to admit that's quite a feat that they're
2930160	2931160	doing it.
2931160	2933460	I mean that it's happening there.
2933460	2937840	Whether you're a fan of that theory or not, you got to say, wow, that is quite a political
2937840	2938840	feat that they're doing.
2938840	2939840	Yeah.
2939840	2940840	Here's what they're doing.
2940840	2941840	They're wasting money is what they're doing.
2941840	2945600	They're wasting money by giving everybody healthcare, whether you deserve it or not.
2945600	2948960	And they're also wasting money with all these fucking laws that you're trying to pass.
2948960	2950440	No, we, we, they deserve help.
2950440	2951440	All right.
2951440	2952440	You know what?
2952440	2953440	They're not fucking working.
2953440	2954440	They don't deserve healthcare.
2954440	2956120	You got to pitch in to get something back.
2956120	2957120	You know what?
2957120	2960720	What about if somebody, you know what, I will tell you this right now and you're about to
2960720	2963080	get the verbal bitch slap for me.
2963080	2964320	I got laid off of my job.
2964320	2965320	I have been applying.
2965320	2966320	Dan has been applying.
2966320	2968240	Neither of us have insurance right now.
2968240	2970120	And if he had another heart attack, what would we do?
2970120	2971120	He would die.
2971120	2975040	End of story because we can't afford, I understand that, but you were working at one time.
2975040	2977960	So you have already contributed to society, there were a lot of people that are homeless
2977960	2981480	on the street now because they lost their jobs.
2981480	2983420	Their houses were foreclosed on and they have nowhere to live.
2983420	2988360	We know a person personally in that circumstance.
2988360	2991400	So yeah, I think before you, you know, say shit like that, please.
2991400	2992400	I'm sorry.
2992400	2993400	It's my opinion.
2993400	2994400	Okay.
2994400	2995400	I don't care.
2995400	2996920	Some of these people that are homeless, they choose to be homeless.
2996920	3000840	There has been tons of studies where people have tried to help these people out and sure
3000840	3003640	enough, they give them money or whatever, and they're back on the street again because
3003640	3005040	they can't fend for themselves.
3005040	3008720	Nine years stands for to stent in the ranks right there.
3008720	3012320	Well, it's like a married couple, but I could queue up the penis song again if that's what
3012320	3013320	we need.
3013320	3017000	Let's just work towards getting our money spent on more important things like putting
3017000	3019760	shrimp on treadmills.
3019760	3022800	All I'm saying is that they're passing a lot of these laws.
3022800	3023800	It's just wasting.
3023800	3027320	Why don't you like, I don't know, work on a state budget.
3027320	3028320	How about that?
3028320	3030080	You know, cause they don't have that taken care of yet.
3030080	3034160	Yeah, but that's the city and not the state.
3034160	3039720	Okay, so yeah, tomorrow, big day for gamers is going to be, going to be interesting.
3039720	3040720	I like cake.
3040720	3042560	This cake is delit.
3042560	3045040	And it's not a lie.
3045040	3046440	This is legitimate cake.
3046440	3051480	And it's hilarious because I used to own those very same plates.
3051480	3052480	I've lost control.
3052480	3053480	All right.
3053480	3054480	You had control?
3054480	3055960	Yeah, I never did.
3055960	3060120	Hey, let's talk about the PlayStation four.
3060120	3061120	That's right.
3061120	3062120	PlayStation four.
3062120	3063120	I'm going to throw up now.
3063120	3064680	No, here's the deal.
3064680	3069760	It was asked this week of some of the Sony higher ups, specifically Jack Trenton, who
3069760	3074200	of course, he's the guy that Sony has on stage for all the oppressors and all that stuff.
3074200	3076500	They asked Jack Trenton, what do you think of the Wii U?
3076500	3081440	Are you feeling the pressures to develop the PlayStation four because now Nintendo has
3081440	3087160	announced the Wii U and Jack Trenton said to Forbes, I didn't see anything about Nintendo's
3087160	3090880	announcement that said, oh, we'd better get working on rolling out a new PlayStation here
3090880	3092280	pretty soon.
3092280	3095680	What we've seen from the competition is trying to add features that already exist in the
3095680	3097640	PlayStation three.
3097640	3101320	We've invested heavily in that and we've rolled a very heavy rock up a steep hill through
3101320	3102320	the launch period.
3102320	3106040	But now I think that all pays off and we've got a long run way behind it.
3106040	3109360	Very interesting that they call it a steep hill and kind of admitting that it was a rough
3109360	3110360	launch for them.
3110360	3111360	He has a point.
3111360	3116840	And the point is also, if you think about it, Nintendo has never developed HD games.
3116840	3121220	I mean, they're way behind everybody else as far as putting out games that are high
3121220	3122360	definition.
3122360	3123360	I don't know.
3123360	3124360	It sells consoles.
3124360	3125600	I guess they haven't had to so far.
3125600	3128640	Yeah, but you see, they'll get you only so far.
3128640	3133320	Then they realize, oh, hey, people that are hardcore gamers, the ones actually purchasing
3133320	3136960	games other than, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.
3136960	3141500	Yeah, let's let's assume they have enough money to buy an HDTV, first of all, and then
3141500	3143360	let's develop HD games.
3143360	3145760	You're right, because no one has HDTVs nowadays.
3145760	3146760	Oh, my God.
3146760	3151840	I'm just, where am I going to find people that own HDTVs out there?
3151840	3152840	Ugh!
3152840	3157360	Everywhere is where I'm going to find them because they sell them everywhere and people
3157360	3160680	have already adopted to that and they've already adopted to new HD formats.
3160680	3163960	I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.
3163960	3168520	I'm still busy watching UHF and sending out newsletters on a mimeograph, sorry.
3168520	3170600	I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.
3170600	3174440	Well, I think also you have to look at this now.
3174440	3176940	You know, we're at this point where, yeah, there's some people that still have their
3176940	3181200	standard definition TVs because they haven't had an upgrade, but inevitably those TVs will
3181200	3182200	fail.
3182200	3183200	All TVs will fail.
3183200	3188280	And there's, you can't buy a standard definition TV anymore unless it's at a garage sale or
3188280	3189280	something.
3189280	3192840	I mean, if you go into a Target or a Walmart, you all only have HDTVs to choose from now.
3192840	3194040	And you know what's funny?
3194040	3197280	I've got video game systems now that will not play on any modern television.
3197280	3199920	Oh, yeah, not without some serious shopping at Radio Shack.
3199920	3203040	I need to actually have a UHF capable TV.
3203040	3211840	All right, so yeah, in a nutshell, he's basically saying, well, I don't see the need to hurry
3211840	3214800	up and develop the PlayStation 4, because it looks to me like Nintendo's just trying
3214800	3216760	to get up to the level of the PlayStation 3.
3216760	3217760	Bitch slap.
3217760	3218760	Well, and also...
3218760	3222680	Funny for the ones that were a little late to the party with Move and Shut, shit like
3222680	3223680	that.
3223680	3224680	Yeah.
3224680	3228200	And also, to their point, I mean, they're on the 10-year life cycle or whatever, so
3228200	3230320	they're not going to kind of deviate from that.
3230320	3233320	And I don't think you're going to see the same thing happening with Microsoft either,
3233320	3237680	because they're confident that the Kinect is going to drive the console for the next
3237680	3239640	five years or whatever.
3239640	3246200	And Nintendo really, sales are dipping, and no one really gives a crap about...
3246200	3249640	There's going to be the people that will buy every fucking Mario game that comes out, Mario
3249640	3254600	Kart game and Animal Crossing game, even if it's just slightly different than the last
3254600	3258680	one, because they're suckers for that kind of stuff.
3258680	3263920	Now at the same time, though, they need to get with it, because a standard definition
3263920	3269440	console isn't going to cut it when, say, the next console generation rolls around, and
3269440	3274400	they're going to be playing some catch up when the next generation comes around, even
3274400	3280100	though it is going to be able to push a little bit better graphics than the 360 is, but they
3280100	3281440	have to know how to use it.
3281440	3283560	Now the third party developers probably won't have a problem with that, because they're
3283560	3290820	used to developing HD games, but Nintendo themselves, I think you're going to see them
3290820	3294480	struggling trying to figure out how to utilize this console, and I think they're going to
3294480	3300040	go more the gimmicky route, where cartoon graphics and shit with the touch screen.
3300040	3304200	Yeah, they tend to be a little more agile as far as console concepts, but the technology
3304200	3306080	just lags a little bit behind.
3306080	3309200	Not that it doesn't sell, but it sells to a different crowd.
3309200	3313080	Well one other Sony tidbit for you guys before I get to a story from Dark Sakura, but you
3313080	3316200	know, of course, one of the big selling points, speaking of touch screens, on the Vita is
3316200	3321480	not just the touch screen, but the rear touch panel, the reach around panel, if you will.
3321480	3327620	In an interview with Famitsu Magazine, Suhei Yoshida, who's the president of World Wide
3327620	3334940	Studios for Sony, said that the reach around panel almost was not on the final design because
3334940	3336680	of cost.
3336680	3341640	Sony was not sure that it would really impact the gameplay, and maybe it's not worthy of
3341640	3343200	the sticker price.
3343200	3348880	They say once people actually got their hands on it, that it became a must-have feature.
3348880	3352920	Some small elements of the Vita's design are still subject to change, so we'll see what
3352920	3354680	happens.
3354680	3356760	But the reach around panel will still be there.
3356760	3359800	I imagine when they say other things are subject to change, they're talking about what, like
3359800	3365440	button positioning, or maybe the memory inside, or whatever, some of the chips that make the
3365440	3367480	thing work, that all can still change.
3367480	3368720	So we'll see what happens.
3368720	3372320	It's probably not going to change very much, seeing as it's only a few months away.
3372320	3375400	Yeah, maybe slight configuration things, but I can't...
3375400	3376600	It will come in white.
3376600	3377600	Yeah, exactly.
3377600	3380440	It will come in different colors.
3380440	3381440	So we'll see.
3381440	3383580	All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.
3383580	3390880	We have some other news that is, well, it's Wii-related, Wii.
3390880	3394180	How bad do you want Xenoblade for Wii?
3394180	3395960	How many people want it?
3395960	3401360	Well, apart from that, there's also the last story, Pandora's Tower.
3401360	3407520	Those are the set right there that actually people are asking to have released outside
3407520	3409240	of Japan and Europe.
3409240	3412640	So we're hoping that Nintendo can bring it to the US.
3412640	3417960	Let me guess, there's online petitions and things of that sort?
3417960	3420160	There's letter writing.
3420160	3427920	They're actually, basically, there's a bunch of stuff that's gone out from the IGN forums
3427920	3430400	asking Nintendo to put out the games.
3430400	3435120	So they're actually looking for physical letters to be sent in to Nintendo.
3435120	3437280	Because that works so well for Mother 3.
3437280	3438280	Yeah, exactly.
3438280	3439280	I was just thinking the same thing.
3439280	3440760	It's just earthbound all over again.
3440760	3445320	You know, it is a little strange that they didn't, you know, with especially as big of
3445320	3449360	a game as the last story, it just jumps out at me out of those three with what an epic,
3449360	3454360	epic game it was supposed to be, or is, I guess you could say, in Japan.
3454360	3457560	It's really surprising to me they didn't come out and say anything about it at E3, that
3457560	3459640	this game was on its way.
3459640	3463280	Is it maybe something they're keeping in their hat for if Wii U gets delayed?
3463280	3464760	Well, there's more though.
3464760	3468480	Xenoblade was at E3 under a different name.
3468480	3475040	And they actually flat out asked Reggie about the titles and he just went, oh, look, Pony.
3475040	3476360	I'm sorry, that's not a Mario game.
3476360	3479220	I don't know what you're talking about.
3479220	3482640	Take it from a Tales of fan, this shit never works.
3482640	3484920	This petitioning never, ever works.
3484920	3489620	Well, it might work if you can get a million people to sign it.
3489620	3490620	Not even.
3490620	3494660	If they want to screw a particular audience, they will.
3494660	3495840	You know what I think?
3495840	3500680	And this is what I think for a lot of the big import titles, or, you know, the big Japan-only
3500680	3503120	releases that we want to see in America.
3503120	3510800	Do it like they handled the remastered Macross DVDs, where you have a price set for if we
3510800	3513840	have this many pre-orders, the game will be this price.
3513840	3515140	And we'll do it.
3515140	3519000	This is what it's going to cost plus standard profit margin.
3519000	3523840	And then we get more pre-orders to this level, the price goes down.
3523840	3525840	We get more orders to this level, the price goes down.
3525840	3527640	So kind of a kickstart thing.
3527640	3531820	Since we're reminiscing about the past a lot tonight, it reminds me of what Konami did
3531820	3536120	for BeatMania 2DX7 style when that finally came out on home consoles, is that they basically
3536120	3540420	said if we can get 10,000 people to pre-order the game, we'll make it.
3540420	3543960	And it just, it amazes me to this day that they got away with something like that.
3543960	3548480	Because you're like, you're putting down a full pre-order on a game, you don't even know
3548480	3550640	it's going to happen or not.
3550640	3551640	So it's kind of weird.
3551640	3553320	But if they say they're not going to do it, then they have to refund the money.
3553320	3554320	Yeah, I know that.
3554320	3558560	But it's still weird that so many people are willing to kind of put down the money up front
3558560	3559560	on a maybe.
3559560	3560560	You know what I mean?
3560560	3561560	It's just crazy.
3561560	3562560	And the fans will do stuff.
3562560	3567920	Well that, I mean, but you notice I brought up the, uh, the, uh, Macross box set?
3567920	3568920	They did that.
3568920	3570200	It actually worked.
3570200	3575800	And the price went down for, like, a full series box set to something way low.
3575800	3579540	Just throw it away.
3579540	3584080	And you know, if they do this, I'm going to put this up, because...
3584080	3586480	That's his middle finger, folks, because it's not a TV show.
3586480	3590040	Uh, yeah, because, I'm sorry, it's, it's stupid.
3590040	3595440	Why make all your fans of your system jump through hoops to get a game put out over here?
3595440	3598420	You either do it because you want to put it out, or you don't do it.
3598420	3600880	Don't make people beg for it.
3600880	3602080	I mean...
3602080	3603080	The bottom line.
3603080	3604080	Money.
3604080	3605600	It's all back to money.
3605600	3606600	It's a company.
3606600	3607600	They need to make a profit.
3607600	3609560	And the Wii is not selling software right now.
3609560	3613320	And remember, it's all about ease of getting these games out.
3613320	3617800	It's a lot easier for them to take a GameCube game, pretty the graphics up a little bit,
3617800	3623760	and port it back out, and call it like a anniversary collection or some bullshit like that.
3623760	3629080	And then charge, you know, 50 bucks, and then people will, you know, totally eat it up,
3629080	3630080	or...
3630080	3631080	I didn't say Roger.
3631080	3632080	Thank you.
3632080	3633080	Roger.
3633080	3634080	Apparently now Rob is called Roger.
3634080	3635240	It's all right, I'll take it.
3635240	3637000	Thank you.
3637000	3639440	Or they can, you know, spend the money.
3639440	3642540	It's going to take to localize a game that's pretty awesome.
3642540	3646240	They're not going to do that, because localizing a game is going to take a lot of time.
3646240	3651600	You know, what I think the best bet would be is to get that game pitched to some companies,
3651600	3662120	say for example like, you know, Tomo, or UFO Interactive, or Ignition, or you know, Axis
3662120	3663120	Game Localization.
3663120	3666560	You know, those companies that basically all they do now, in fact, I don't know if it's
3666560	3670680	one of the stories in the show role, but Ignition stopped making their own first party, or their
3670680	3672160	own games.
3672160	3678040	They had a game that they developed, El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron, but now they're
3678040	3681960	just saying, listen, we're just going to take properties that are over in Japan, just bring
3681960	3683880	them over instead of making our own shit.
3683880	3687680	So that's who you need to, you know, pitch that game to, is one of those companies.
3687680	3689640	Sounds like they're going to be the next Working Designs.
3689640	3691900	And they will basically do it for you.
3691900	3695580	Of course, after they get done with President Cat, because they haven't started on President
3695580	3697840	Cat yet, and so we don't have that yet.
3697840	3698840	That's right.
3698840	3702040	You can't have the last story until we get President Cat.
3702040	3704840	That's just the way it's going to be.
3704840	3705840	President Cat.
3705840	3706840	All right.
3706840	3707840	Moving on.
3707840	3710460	Loki, what do you got for us?
3710460	3715440	So free-to-play, it's something that I believe when Nintendo was asked about it, they said,
3715440	3721240	nope, we have no plans on putting anything free on our marketplace, you bastards.
3721240	3725240	Well, at least as far as free-to-play MMOs or something like that.
3725240	3731480	Well, Microsoft's actually kind of feeling out with developers to see if they can, you
3731480	3733880	know, get some free-to-play games.
3733880	3737600	And I guess they're now contacting studios, discussing the possibility of free-to-play
3737600	3743960	games, and you know, building some sort of infrastructure for the 360 that incorporates
3743960	3746360	microtransactions.
3746360	3751480	Because they were like, Free Realms is so awesome on the PlayStation 3, and we want
3751480	3753360	a game on Xbox where you can play as a fairy.
3753360	3756560	I don't think that they're necessarily doing that, but I think that they see the profit
3756560	3762400	that like, say, like, you know, Farmville or the Smurfs Village stuff, you know, that
3762400	3771880	makes a lot of money, and people, some people are looking for that kind of thing, so maybe?
3771880	3775080	Would you be interested in free-to-play games on the Xbox, Loki?
3775080	3776080	No.
3776080	3777080	No?
3777080	3778080	Why not?
3778080	3779080	Just because the quality is less, or?
3779080	3781720	It's usually not my, you know, the type of games that I want to play.
3781720	3785840	If it was like a free-to-play grant that thought of MMO or something, that's a little different.
3785840	3794600	I'd at least check it out, like, you know, heck, I even played Yaris for like, 10 seconds.
3794600	3801560	So alright, let's move on with some more gaming news, and I'm gonna get to a story about PlayStation
3801560	3803600	hardware in Japan.
3803600	3807480	I believe there's a new bundle that has come out there in Japan.
3807480	3814600	It's a charcoal black console, decreased power consumption they're saying, a 320 gig hard
3814600	3815600	drive with it.
3815600	3820880	It's a model CECH 3000B, and it was announced by Sony in Japan over the weekend.
3820880	3828080	It is going to be 34,980 yen, and there will also be a 160 gig version of the model that
3828080	3835400	will come with Tales of Zilia, that is coming for $470, so you get that game.
3835400	3838400	Not coming in this new bundle, an HDMI cable.
3838400	3839400	That is true.
3839400	3840400	No HDMI cable.
3840400	3843200	And you know what else is coming in that bundle?
3843200	3845640	New game encryption.
3845640	3850040	Oh, is that really why they're trying to get the hardware out there?
3850040	3853960	They're putting out new hardware that's gonna change the way the keys are stored.
3853960	3857840	Although, gotta have some sort of backwards compatibility because, or, I remember, they're
3857840	3864640	moving the, instead of having the actual keys built in, or the authentication keys built
3864640	3870000	into the console itself, it's being built into the Blu-ray drive.
3870000	3875300	Much like how the 360 works, whereas they have it, you know, all the authentication
3875300	3883240	stuff is through the Blu-ray drive, or their DVD drive, obviously Blu-ray, not on the Xbox
3883240	3884240	360.
3884240	3885240	Alright.
3885240	3888480	DarkStalker, what do you got for us before we get to release dates?
3888480	3893180	Well, we have some little buggies fixed with the 3DS.
3893180	3898680	There were a couple problems the different consumers were saying that was going on, and
3898680	3901720	according to Mr. Reggie, he says they're fixed.
3901720	3908720	He said that the eShop is fixing one of them, because, well, it didn't launch with the eShop.
3908720	3911400	It didn't shop with, yeah.
3911400	3919720	And the other thing is that they're basically, the biggest hang-up was that they didn't have
3919720	3923680	a big Nintendo franchise, so they said they're fixing that too.
3923680	3927760	In other words, we had no launch games, basically, is that what I'm hearing out of that.
3927760	3929200	Well, that's why I didn't buy one.
3929200	3931560	Their strongest launch title was from Capcom.
3931560	3934280	I think it was Dead or Alive.
3934280	3936480	I get, unless you want to count Pilotwings.
3936480	3938720	Dead or Alive was apparently very terrible.
3938720	3940800	I've heard from a lot of people that Dead or Alive was really good.
3940800	3943880	Technically it didn't launch with Dead or Alive, that came out, I mean Launch Window,
3943880	3944880	or whatever you want to call it.
3944880	3948360	That is some bullshit there, Launch Window.
3948360	3953600	Technically, it launched with the web store, because it was within the launch window.
3953600	3957320	Well, how about I pay you at the end of the launch window, how's that sound?
3957320	3959320	That doesn't work, no?
3959320	3964760	I'm excited about the idea that Netflix might come to the 3DS, because I like the idea of
3964760	3967840	having kind of like the portable device to watch.
3967840	3968840	Oh Rob.
3968840	3972840	I mean, granted, I know there's the phone, but also not just the portable thing in the
3972840	3977360	bed with, I think, a larger screen on those things, but also the possibility of actual
3977360	3978720	3D movies.
3978720	3982080	Even though a lot of 3D movies are kind of eh, it's kind of cool in a way.
3982080	3986400	I don't think it's going to be able to do 3D right, since it's all in particular anyway.
3986400	3990120	They'd have to code it for, they'd have to re-image them to be specific for the lenticular
3990120	3991120	monitor.
3991120	3993640	Yeah, because like the 3DS, 3D doesn't bother me at all, it's kind of cool.
3993640	3994640	But it's not real 3D.
3994640	3995760	The 3DS and the theater, I don't like.
3995760	3996760	It's not real 3D.
3996760	3997760	Yeah, I guess that's true.
3997760	4000500	I don't think it would be that difficult for them to do that, I mean, they do that already
4000500	4004720	with, you know, Blu-ray 3D stuff, I mean, there's a bunch of different formats that,
4004720	4010120	you know, 3D TV support, so I don't see why that would be a problem.
4010120	4014600	Hey, you gotta admit, if Tron's gonna end up on 3D Netflix, you gotta at least check
4014600	4015600	that out.
4015600	4017200	That's gonna be pretty awesome.
4017200	4019920	You know, it's funny, right before Tron was coming out, they was like, let's go get 3D
4019920	4022920	TV, let's go get 3D TV, Tron's coming out, let's go get 3D TV.
4022920	4024920	I'm like, no.
4024920	4025920	So.
4025920	4032440	Alright, so we'll see if, I'm really curious to see how 3DS will sell this holiday.
4032440	4034760	This is definitely gonna be a make or break time for 3DS.
4034760	4037760	Well, I was just a little annoyed that they were talking about like franchises coming
4037760	4038760	out.
4038760	4042480	Look at all the things we announced that are gonna be coming out, you know, like, you know,
4042480	4046560	all these different franchises that aren't coming out until the fourth quarter.
4046560	4049440	The 3DS is gonna get really awesome soon.
4049440	4050440	Soon.
4050440	4053320	You know, like in a few months, when it's awesome.
4053320	4055880	Right now you have a paperweight.
4055880	4057080	Enjoy your blue brick.
4057080	4061760	I gotta tell you though, I mean, based off of what's, you know, scheduled to come out
4061760	4065960	for the 3DS, it's not all that exciting.
4065960	4068960	It's about as exciting as the DS is.
4068960	4069960	It really is not.
4069960	4073800	It's really into Ocarina of Time, I mean, that's one of the stronger titles right now.
4073800	4074800	Yeah.
4074800	4080280	But, I mean, even like new release stuff, there's really not anything, like, exclusive
4080280	4081280	for it.
4081280	4082760	It's like, oh my god, I gotta have that.
4082760	4086460	Alright, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.
4086460	4090720	What can you get at a store near you for some other consoles in your house this week, starting
4090720	4091720	in the US?
4091720	4095760	Well, today, and I know this was on everybody's radar, but Mystery Case files the Malgrave
4095760	4098540	Incident out for the Nintendo Wii, yes.
4098540	4099540	That's the same suit.
4099540	4100920	You gotta give me my pre-order.
4100920	4103960	That's the same franchise that was on the DS.
4103960	4106000	Ooh, I'm so excited about that.
4106000	4108120	Thank you, Nintendo.
4108120	4111840	Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition on the 360 in case you don't own a console version
4111840	4116040	of Super Street Fighter IV, you can buy that with the DLC already in there, otherwise you
4116040	4120800	can just download the DLC and that's on 360 and PS3.
4120800	4125440	Another game series that really a lot of people don't care about, Dynasty Warriors Gundam
4125440	4126440	3.
4126440	4132320	Yes, they've made three of them now and that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.
4132320	4136760	Sniper Ghost Warrior finally making its way out on PS3.
4136760	4141420	A re-release of Call of Duty Black Ops, now the limited edition with the first strike
4141420	4144680	download content bundled in there.
4144680	4150560	Resident Evil The Mercenaries for the 3DS, I believe we have a story about that later.
4150560	4156000	Boy, other fun stuff is coming out this week.
4156000	4162480	Three Stories Curse of the Ancient Spirit, that's exciting.
4162480	4173320	And finally, UFC Personal Trainer, the Ultimate Fitness System, that's right, it is a UFC
4173320	4179120	themed fitness game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4179120	4188080	Alright, well going over to Japan and checking out the Japanese releases, coming out on the
4188080	4195280	Xbox 360 from Sega on June 30th is Power Smash 4, that's just basically Virtua Tennis.
4195280	4200840	I got really excited for a minute because I thought it might be Power Stone, but no
4200840	4203400	it's Power Smash which is Virtua Tennis.
4203400	4206440	The Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition comes out in Japan as well and Test Drive
4206440	4210520	Unlimited 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the Xbox 360.
4210520	4216080	Going over to the PlayStation 3 in Japan, Initial D Extreme Stage gets a price reduction
4216080	4221800	as does Senjou no Valkyria which I believe is Valkyria Chronicles over there in Japan
4221800	4223800	gets its price reductions.
4223800	4229160	Power Smash 4 or Virtua Tennis also on the PlayStation 3 this week, it's a big SEGA week.
4229160	4233140	And the same games, Super Street Fighter IV and Test Drive Unlimited 2 all making their
4233140	4238260	way to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
4238260	4241560	Going over to some other consoles, how about the Sony PSP?
4241560	4245780	We have Initial D Street Stage getting a price reduction as well as some other releases.
4245780	4250440	Two Heart 2 Dungeon Travelers comes out in regular and limited edition, again that's
4250440	4252400	for the PSP.
4252400	4261400	This is a game, it's an RPG where I guess it's kind of like they're reliving their childhood
4261400	4265180	fantasies or something but then you have the chick in the maid outfit with her legs up
4265180	4268760	and you're like, I don't want to think about childhood fantasies and see those pictures
4268760	4269760	so I don't know.
4269760	4270760	It's a very...
4270760	4275360	Kind of childhood fantasies, are they having pedo bear childhood fantasies?
4275360	4279420	That actually makes me think of an anime that I started watching.
4279420	4281800	On the Wii, do I even want to know what anime?
4281800	4283760	Are you sure it was an anime?
4283760	4290340	It's called something like My Little Sister Can't Be That Cute and basically this guy
4290340	4294840	finds out that his sister, who's totally cool and popular with all of her friends and everything,
4294840	4302880	is a closet otaku and her fandom is Little Sister Hentai.
4302880	4306400	On the Wii, Biohazard and Biohazard Zero get a price reduction.
4306400	4309760	The show itself isn't dirty but she's into it.
4309760	4312160	Oh Japan, never change.
4312160	4318160	You heard about the guy in Canada, right, who brought Mango over there and got arrested
4318160	4323040	because of their child pornography laws or something like that and it faces up to a year.
4323040	4330120	It faces a minimum of a year in jail and apparently all manga is banned there.
4330120	4333040	I guess it makes the video game laws here not seem so bad.
4333040	4337160	Anyhow, of course, Biohazard is Resident Evil, Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero get price
4337160	4338160	reductions.
4338160	4344200	Also, finally, coming out on the Wii in Japan this week, Goldeneye 007, that's right.
4344200	4347360	The game we got here over the holidays, you can now play in Japan.
4347360	4353160	I'm assuming it's been localized and such for the region, hence the great delay.
4353160	4357160	And then you can play the game and then remember how much better it was on the Nintendo 64.
4357160	4363440	Lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Tales of the Abyss from Bandai Namco, which, is
4363440	4364760	this an official Tales game?
4364760	4365760	Wait, what?
4365760	4366760	Yes it is.
4366760	4367760	Yes it is.
4367760	4368760	It happens to be my favorite Tales game.
4368760	4371560	Well, guess what, it's on the 3DS this week in Japan.
4371560	4373140	God damn it, Japan.
4373140	4374140	God damn it, Namco.
4374140	4375560	You can import it on your region free.
4375560	4376560	Oh wait, no you can't.
4376560	4377560	No way.
4377560	4380560	That's right, they got rid of that on the 3DS and there's no bastards.
4380560	4389680	See, that's what I was talking about, Namco always screwing over anything that's not Japanese.
4389680	4393200	Alright moving on, how about UK releases Dark Sakura?
4393200	4394200	She's chatting with Chaz.
4394200	4396520	I'm telling Penis Man that he's not weird.
4396520	4402600	Oh and by the way, the name of the anime is called Ore no Emoto ga Konan ni Koai wa Kani
4402600	4403600	ga Nai.
4403600	4407040	That's tight.
4407040	4408040	It's actually really funny.
4408040	4411280	So are you stroking Penis Man's ego in the chat?
4411280	4415800	On the 28th we have Call of Duty Black Ops, Annihilation Pack, or as my brain initially
4415800	4417680	saw it, Black Oops.
4417680	4423080	And then on the 29th we have Backbreaker Vengeance, ooh, which sounds kind of dirty.
4423080	4429160	And then Half Minute Heroes, Super Mega Neo Climax, which also sounds kind of dirty.
4429160	4430160	I know.
4430160	4432080	I wouldn't want to meet the Half Minute Heroes.
4432080	4436480	That series is actually kind of cool, that's the sick thing is that 30 second hero, whatever
4436480	4438260	they call it here, is actually kind of fun.
4438260	4439260	It's a neat series.
4439260	4442960	I just wouldn't want to meet the Half Minute Hero in his climax.
4442960	4444680	Didn't they have that come out in Xbox Live Arcade?
4444680	4446680	I think I dated him.
4446680	4447680	Spooked.
4447680	4453280	Did he post on DDR Freak 2?
4453280	4455280	Shush you.
4455280	4459000	Oh, God gets it.
4459000	4460000	Alright.
4460000	4461000	No.
4461000	4462000	I only have one thing to say about that game.
4462000	4463000	I know that.
4463000	4464000	Spooked.
4464000	4470040	Moving on, two more stories for you, and then the classic game of the week.
4470040	4476880	So I know this isn't the 90s, and this isn't The Matrix, but apparently Ubisoft wants you
4476880	4483880	to beat Neo at Child of Eden, a game that's sort of like The Matrix, because you're, hmm,
4483880	4491040	I know Kung Fu, flying around, less Keanu Reeves, but no, the artist Neo, apparently
4491040	4499040	he has a high score on the Evolution level, and to, I guess, boost Ubisoft's donation
4499040	4505760	of the Japanese earthquake relief, you have to try to beat his score.
4505760	4513300	100,000 is already pledged, but for every score on the level, it's normal connect leaderboard
4513300	4519800	exceeding Neo's 306,800 points between now and July 4th, Ubisoft will add an additional
4519800	4525400	dollar up to a maximum of 20,000 dollars.
4525400	4526400	Why Neo?
4526400	4531860	I don't understand why that artist out of, you know, I just don't think of Neo when I
4531860	4536580	think of Child of Eden, you know?
4536580	4538080	Maybe he's a fan of the game.
4538080	4543880	Maybe Samuel L. Jackson had something else going on, or Ice-T, you know, he was too busy
4543880	4547920	pimping Call of Duty.
4547920	4549960	Let me just compare a little bit here, okay?
4549960	4552240	We have Neo, ready?
4552240	4553240	Here's Neo.
4553240	4561880	Okay, I don't think I've heard that song at the club before, right?
4561880	4568000	So there's Neo, and then here is Child of Eden.
4568000	4581640	That's right, you're getting a headache, because those two don't go together.
4581640	4583640	Completely different key.
4583640	4588320	Whatever, I guess whatever brings awareness to the game.
4588320	4593480	All right, this has been some pretty controversial news this week.
4593480	4597280	Team Fortress 2 went free to play, if you haven't already heard, and yeah, it's interesting
4597280	4601720	because of course Steam has released a lot of free to play games, other people's games,
4601720	4605120	you know, including things like Spiral Knights and Champions Online and things that for the
4605120	4607160	most part were already free to play.
4607160	4611080	But Valve has taken one of its most popular games and made it free to play, and of course
4611080	4615940	there's been lots of hooray, free shit, and then there's been lots of boo, this game I
4615940	4622480	paid for five years ago is now free and that makes me angry, because, you know, games don't
4622480	4625520	ever go on sale or, you know, end up in a bargain bin.
4625520	4629160	That's totally not how I wound up with most of my Steam collection anyway.
4629160	4635360	There are so many butthurt people about this going free to play, there are apparently servers
4635360	4639900	that are auto-banning people that are detected on the free to play version, there are people
4639900	4643580	that are just like, our game is ruined because of free to play, and so forth, and to those
4643580	4648840	people I say, fuck off immediately, because you are what's wrong with gaming right now.
4648840	4650000	Cry some more.
4650000	4654580	That whole, like, elitist asshole attitude just isn't gonna get you anywhere.
4654580	4655580	Like in life.
4655580	4656580	Period.
4656580	4661960	It reminds me of when Steam had the free weekends of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2, and Black
4661960	4663440	Ops.
4663440	4668480	There was nothing but disdain to lower level folk because they were, you know, trial noobs,
4668480	4673240	they were weekend warriors, they were too cheap to play, you know, buy the real thing.
4673240	4676280	I'm like, dude, fuck you, I might actually buy it.
4676280	4677600	If you guys weren't such dicks.
4677600	4684160	Yeah, I mean, and the game is, the game is five years old, and to be fair, Valve, although
4684160	4688400	they, you know, have done so many updates over the past few years and so forth, this
4688400	4692160	has gotten people talking about the game more than anything in quite some time.
4692160	4696280	It's just a refreshing break from complaining about hats.
4696280	4697280	I guess so.
4697280	4698280	That could be true.
4698280	4703000	But yeah, I mean, I for one, I downloaded the game some time ago, I paid for it, you
4703000	4707880	know, it came with the orange box, and I'm not mad that it went free to play because
4707880	4711480	I realized I bought it several years ago and I could have been playing it then this entire
4711480	4712480	time.
4712480	4715320	And then, because I got old, why did it get old to me?
4715320	4718840	I had nobody to play with, because I don't want to play with elitist assholes.
4718840	4721760	Well gee, I'm sorry, Rob, you should have poked me some time.
4721760	4722760	But...
4722760	4723760	Uh...
4723760	4724760	Not in that way, not that way.
4724760	4726320	You must buy me a drink first.
4726320	4727320	Whoo!
4727320	4732320	But, but, I mean, for real though, like, this news, if anything, makes me maybe want to
4732320	4735400	go back and play Team Fortress 2 because I know there'll be other people to play with,
4735400	4739280	who will be as terrible as me, or at least not be jerks about it if they are pretty good.
4739280	4742080	You know what I mean?
4742080	4745040	Otherwise I hadn't really given this game a second thought, and yet I don't feel like
4745040	4746520	I wasted my money.
4746520	4750680	The orange box was one of the best deals ever in gaming.
4750680	4751680	Ever!
4751680	4752680	One of the best deals.
4752680	4757480	Oh yeah, but where were people complaining when, uh, when Portal became free for a limited
4757480	4758480	time?
4758480	4759480	Hmm?
4759480	4762160	Oh wait, that's not multiplayer.
4762160	4765320	We're not an unpleasable fanbase when it comes to that, are we?
4765320	4769160	Melted General in our chat says Team Fortress 2 is on its 218th update.
4769160	4770160	Uh, that's...
4770160	4771160	It is a lot of updates.
4771160	4774760	Now Rob, did it do that free, did it, did it, like, have you start downloading the Team
4774760	4776720	Fortress 2 beta?
4776720	4778480	I don't know, because I bought the game years ago, so...
4778480	4783000	Well I mean, I bought mine a long time ago, and it's, it, suddenly I looked on there and
4783000	4784960	it says downloading Team Fortress 2 beta.
4784960	4786420	Which is weird.
4786420	4788040	It might be a free beta or something, who knows.
4788040	4792940	Uh, the Rob D. in our chatroom at chat.org.com says I'm pissed in the way anyone is when
4792940	4795000	something goes on sale after they bought it.
4795000	4799080	I don't feel like Valve should refund me or anything, such is life.
4799080	4800080	That's kind of how I feel too.
4800080	4801080	You gotta be pissed at yourself.
4801080	4803440	I bought Left 4 Dead 2 when it was 20 bucks.
4803440	4805440	The day after it became 7.
4805440	4810280	Yeah, I bought Torchlight for what, like 10, and then like, I think literally a day later
4810280	4811280	it was 5.
4811280	4812720	Oh well, shit happens.
4812720	4813720	Exactly.
4813720	4817160	You know, where it's like, you go buy a video game and then you find out, oh, if I bought
4817160	4821740	it on, you know, or bought it at Best Buy, I would have got a $10 card with it, you know.
4821740	4824400	These deals, this is just how it works.
4824400	4828080	You have to shop around for the best deals, and if you don't, oh well on you, you know.
4828080	4830800	There's more money in that damn game.
4830800	4835960	I would have been pissed if I'd bought Team Fortress 2 like two weeks ago, but I would
4835960	4839720	have been pissed in the way that somebody who buys Apple products gets pissed every
4839720	4840720	year.
4840720	4847960	Oh, people who, uh, get used to one Adobe suite only to find out that CS6 is coming
4847960	4851480	out in a few months, fuck you Adobe.
4851480	4855880	Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Team Fortress 2 going free, great, and I also bought
4855880	4858680	the orange box, surprised you didn't go free sooner.
4858680	4864120	I just, I haven't heard a lot of like the FPS's or hell even like really the Valve-owned
4864120	4865800	games going free to play.
4865800	4869600	Will Half-Life Episode 3 be free to play?
4869600	4874640	Well for what it's worth, as long as you paid some sort of money in Team Fortress 2, you
4874640	4875640	get perks.
4875640	4878160	They're not leaving us out in the lurch completely.
4878160	4884480	All of this, and Dungeon Buster, it said TF2 going free, great, I also bought the orange
4884480	4885480	box.
4885480	4886480	I bought the orange box.
4886480	4887480	I have it on Xbox.
4887480	4888480	Guess what?
4888480	4894160	I like playing better on my PC, so all this stuff going free, woo.
4894160	4898520	Also in our chat room, Penis Man asks, so are we gonna form an all-games Team Suck?
4898520	4900140	Sure, works for me.
4900140	4902440	If that name isn't already taken, which it probably is.
4902440	4904240	I'll roll up the group name when I get home.
4904240	4905240	Alright, there you go.
4905240	4906240	Team Suck.
4906240	4907240	I could do it.
4907240	4910840	Actually there is, well there isn't, to be real, there is an OLR team already out there.
4910840	4915440	It's something Deep Man put together a long time ago, so I mean, there is already an OLR
4915440	4921520	team, and you know, I'm not saying this in a negative way, but they suck.
4921520	4922520	I know we do.
4922520	4926000	Or at least they will when I start playing on it.
4926000	4928720	We don't need your help to suck, Rob.
4928720	4932480	Black Wolf wants to clarify, yeah, except Apple will refund you within a certain time
4932480	4933480	frame.
4933480	4937920	You know, if I had bought Team Fortress 2 two weeks ago, which I don't know who did,
4937920	4942680	but I wonder if you were to call Valve and complain if maybe they would give a refund.
4942680	4943680	Who knows?
4943680	4948640	Alright, there you go, let's get to the part of the show where we take a trip down memory
4948640	4949640	lane.
4949640	4950640	We trip and fall.
4950640	4951640	Put some bricks.
4951640	4956200	It's the classic game of the week.
4956200	4960640	Dark Sakura is going to take a stroll down classic gaming's path and find the most obscure
4960640	4964640	fucking game she can to be the game of the week, which I believe is the case this week,
4964640	4965640	correct?
4965640	4966640	Yes, actually.
4966640	4967640	I will say something.
4967640	4969840	This is a game that I have talked about before.
4969840	4975040	So it's, it's not really a surprise, it's probably a surprise to people that haven't
4975040	4976040	brought it up already.
4976040	4980360	So the game of the week is called Emerald Dragon.
4980360	4984720	And importers, PC Engine fans, you will know this one.
4984720	4987880	Lots of dialogue, by the way.
4987880	4995880	The game is an RPG done by Glodia, which they did, they're actually created by Telnet employees,
4995880	5000800	including Tenpei Sato, who was behind Disgaea.
5000800	5005280	So this game could be, in theory, a precursor to Disgaea.
5005280	5009720	Does it have prenees?
5009720	5013280	I only played through like the first very part of it, Rob, I was like, I can't read
5013280	5014280	that much Japanese.
5014280	5015280	It's a valid question.
5015280	5026040	Anyway, it came out for PC-88 in 1989, and then came to PC-98, X68000, MSX2, FM Towne's
5026040	5031520	computer, and then the console versions were the PC Engine, CD, and Super Famicom, but
5031520	5033480	they weren't done by Glodia.
5033480	5038000	So there's no versions that are outside of Japan, but you can get a fan's translation
5038000	5041120	for the Super Famicom version by Translation Corporation.
5041120	5043580	So look for it if you really want to play it.
5043580	5046040	So basically, it's a big RPG.
5046040	5051160	There was a war in the past, and then lots of battle, and then there were two races that
5051160	5054320	lived on the main continent, and the Emerald Dragon was our champion, and then the Emerald
5054320	5057000	Dragon died and a curse fell over the land, blah, blah, blah.
5057000	5062920	So now the last dragons are around, and you have to pretty much help them out.
5062920	5070360	You actually find a green-haired girl whose name is Tamarin, which means purity, in the
5070360	5073880	ancient dragon language.
5073880	5076440	We'll call her Virgin.
5076440	5077440	Virgin.
5077440	5083120	But anyway, she has amnesia, so I won't spoil the game for you.
5083120	5088440	There's also Barsem, Farnah, Hathrum, Khorsra, lots of different people, but basically it's
5088440	5093320	a traditional JRPG, but it has some pretty different combat.
5093320	5101840	It has a large world to look over, but it's one big, unified piece, except in the Super
5101840	5102840	Famicom version.
5102840	5105640	Dude, the combat in this looks like Ultima.
5105640	5106640	Yeah.
5106640	5113560	It reminds me of Treasure Hunter G, another gem that never made it to the States.
5113560	5115480	The combat looks dead-on like Treasure Hunter G.
5115480	5121320	Well, if they came out around the same time, then that could, you know, or by a similar
5121320	5122320	team.
5122320	5125600	One was made by Square, and the other, yeah.
5125600	5133360	Well, at any rate, the way that it works is that your timing for your attack is based
5133360	5136280	on your equipment.
5136280	5141360	And then, but the only character that you can control is the main character, Attrucian.
5141360	5147160	The other characters are done by the AI, but the AI is actually pretty smart.
5147160	5151680	At any rate, with the Super Famicom version of this game, it has a dragon transformation
5151680	5156280	system so Attrucian can take on a dragon form.
5156280	5157280	And it's pretty cool.
5157280	5161240	I have the PC Engine version, I have a copy of the PC Engine version of this, I should
5161240	5166720	say, because the game costs in excess of $300 on eBay, on PC Engine.
5166720	5167720	Yikes.
5167720	5172800	One of my friends has this game, which is how I got my copy.
5172800	5179280	She's also the same one who hooked us up with Dracula X when she owed us $100, so.
5179280	5187480	And, but I mean basically, it's standard PC Engine fare as far as the screens, you know,
5187480	5193600	you've got the 16-bit sprites, and then you've got lots of voice acting, because hey, we're
5193600	5197060	doing these games on a CD now, not on HuCards.
5197060	5199480	And all the audio in it is Redbook audio.
5199480	5204120	So you can actually just pop a CD in your car, as long as you skip track two.
5204120	5205120	Nice.
5205120	5212360	So, but that is one of, I think, the gems in any PC Engine collector's archive.
5212360	5219600	Like, if I had to have three games in my PC Engine, actually no I don't have a copy of
5219600	5223040	this one, I have Sapphire, no I don't have Sapphire, so if I had to have three games
5223040	5230040	that were in my, the top tier PC Engine, it would be Dracula X, which I've got, it would
5230040	5234160	be Emerald Dragon and Sapphire, which I've covered Sapphire before.
5234160	5235880	So those would be the three.
5235880	5240640	So you've got your action game, you have your RPG, and you have your shooter.
5240640	5241640	So this is Emerald Dragon.
5241640	5242640	Alright.
5242640	5244080	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5244080	5249240	Very obscure, very hard to find, but very intricate for its time with the voice acting
5249240	5250240	and everything.
5250240	5251240	Emerald Dragon.
5251240	5254940	It actually makes it more playable too, because then I at least have somewhat of a clue of
5254940	5256760	what's going on in the game.
5256760	5261980	But yeah, if I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon, and like, oh look it's Sparna.
5261980	5268160	If I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and not pay like, you know, 300 bucks for
5268160	5269760	it, I would be pretty stoked.
5269760	5274680	Alright, your classic game of the week, Emerald Dragon on the PC Engine.
5274680	5277800	And that's going to bring us to the close of part A, but don't go anywhere guys, we're
5277800	5281960	going to come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, lots of news in part B tonight, some
5281960	5285120	music game based news believe it or not, we're going to kick it off with.
5285120	5289720	Your Twitter topics, so get those in, twitter.com slash olr, any topics like news stories and
5289720	5293040	so forth, or if you just have a question you want to ask us, you know, it's the birthday
5293040	5296000	show and all, maybe there's something that's burning on your mind that you want to ask
5296000	5298360	us, or perhaps our guests, one of the two.
5298360	5301720	Jessica Harper from Understation Live is of course here at the studio, or intern Drew,
5301720	5306800	maybe you have a question for them, you can send those to twitter.com slash olr.
5306800	5310800	And we'll have more stories coming up for you guys, FUs of the Week, Skype calls, and
5310800	5320360	plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5320360	5327040	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we are live with episode number 417, I actually
5327040	5332640	had to look that up, 9 years of Orange Lounge Radio, it's June 26th, 2011 when we're taping
5332640	5336720	of course the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, June the 23rd, because Sundays
5336720	5340560	were on different days back then, of 2002.
5340560	5344960	We're joined in studio tonight not only by of course my co-host Dark Soccer and Loki,
5344960	5349400	always here with us, but by some special guests, intern Drew is in the kitchen, but here in
5349400	5354740	studio with us the lovely Jessica Harper from Understation Live, that's getting birthday
5354740	5359840	spankings later this month for its 10th anniversary show, I mean next month, because we're late
5359840	5366340	June, so next month I guess, within a month, basically two weeks from now-ish, exactly.
5366340	5370720	And we've been spending a lot of the time earlier in the show kind of reminiscing about
5370720	5375240	the good old days of OLR, back when we were playing a lot of DDR and so forth, and for
5375240	5380040	those that haven't heard the story, Jessica and I actually played DDR for the first time
5380040	5381040	together.
5381040	5385800	I didn't see DDR the first time with Jessica, but I'm convinced I walked into the first
5385800	5389680	Milpitas Golf Land tournament and didn't know what I was walking into.
5389680	5395560	But later we were at the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Convention, in Las Vegas, at
5395560	5402280	the Circus Circus, and the machine was calling our name, and it was saying, I-I-I, you know
5402280	5407960	you wanna play my ass, exactly, and we actually skipped, what was it, Shock Treatment or something
5407960	5411800	on Friday, which is a shitty movie anyway, yeah, basically we were bored to tears, we
5411800	5415320	just wanted to relax and go have some, you know, casino time, and we were having our
5415320	5420760	own convention, yeah, we were like, okay, let's go get drunk at, across the way over
5420760	5424840	at Quark's Bar, and exactly, since we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Rocky Horror
5424840	5429520	community anyway, why don't we just go play DDR, exactly, we had fun, it was a good time.
5429520	5433720	But um, also that weekend, and I bring this up because this is kind of topical as of recently,
5433720	5440960	but uh, we went to the Adventure Dome, which is uh, is it even there anymore, it's at Circus
5440960	5444360	Circus, it's like a theme park, indoors at Circus Circus in Vegas, I don't even know
5444360	5448040	if it's there anymore, like, including uh, it had a full roller coaster and everything,
5448040	5451640	yeah, it was actually a pretty badass little place, yeah, I think, I don't think it's there
5451640	5456080	anywhere, because now New York has their roller coaster. I know we have some Vegas people,
5456080	5459400	so I'm sure somebody will chime in in a minute in our chat room and let us know, but um,
5459400	5463440	you know, we were at the Adventure Dome, and one of the things that they had there, and
5463440	5467080	we spent a little money on, about 20 bucks on, and it was a memory that would haunt me
5467080	5471560	forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and it was, and you have to keep in
5471560	5476740	mind that this was 11 years ago, yes, this is even older than, yeah, Understation Live
5476740	5479580	or, uh, Orange
5506740	5511720	K.C.D. has still lodged in my throat from eating, but she can belt it out, and like,
5511720	5515160	I'm kinda like, oh, I know Love Shack, but of course I had to do the guy part, and I'm
5515160	5518720	like, I kinda don't remember how the guy part goes, so I remember at one point, and I got
5518720	5525480	teased over this for like seven years, I would go, Funky Little Shack, Funky Little Shack,
5525480	5528920	like I'm like trying to read the words as they highlight, which, you know, in the song
5528920	5535080	is Funky Little Shack, yeah, I got the song later, but unfortunately, yeah, and that actually
5535080	5540480	became our karaoke song, when Rob and I used to go out to karaoke on a fairly regular basis,
5540480	5545120	that was one of our songs that we did together, you know, other than, what was the other one,
5545120	5552240	Human League, Don't You Want Me Baby, so yeah, we actually did kind of eventually incorporated
5552240	5554360	into our repertoire.
5554360	5558980	So but it's interesting, because whereas that kinda went to go make an ass out of me, it
5558980	5563840	actually showed off that you can sing girl, and I know you've seen that, I know one of
5563840	5568400	your other Cornerstone songs is What's Goin' On by Four Non-Blondes, or What's Up by Four
5568400	5572480	Non-Blondes, and Pat Benatar song you always used to sing too, right?
5572480	5573480	Hit Me With Your Best Shot.
5573480	5574480	That's right, Hit Me With Your Best Shot.
5574480	5575480	Whip Me With Your Big Cock.
5575480	5577480	Sometimes, depending on how drunk she was, she might get up on stage.
5577480	5581920	I remember, you know, it was a gay bar, I remember a certain occasion though at Great
5581920	5586360	America with someone recording Stay, yeah, that too.
5586360	5594160	And then me doing Like A Prayer, which I foolishly let Travis even touch that CD.
5594160	5595160	Anyhow.
5595160	5598800	You should never ever ever let Travis have access to anything that you think might, yeah.
5598800	5605200	I seem to remember also a certain Karaoke Revolution incident with the two of you.
5605200	5609800	And that was when I discovered that this could really belt it out, I was stunned.
5609800	5612240	But you are, you're still doing the vocal thing, right?
5612240	5615680	I know we said for years, like Jess, you should go try out for American Idol, you should go
5615680	5616680	try out for American Idol.
5616680	5620920	Well, now you can't try out for American Idol because you're too old, as we all are.
5620920	5624440	But there's this new show where age doesn't matter, The Voice, right?
5624440	5626800	And have you been watching the show, you're really into it?
5626800	5628760	I am very, very much into it.
5628760	5633280	I heard about it after the first episode, caught up with it online and fell in love
5633280	5638520	with it instantly because the entire concept of The Voice is that you are just a voice.
5638520	5643440	You have, there's no physical you attached to it, it's just a voice in the air.
5643440	5646800	The judges, their chairs are turned completely around, so they can't even see what the hell
5646800	5647800	you look like.
5647800	5653200	You're just singing to them, and they hit their button and turn around to accept you,
5653200	5654800	no matter what you look like.
5654800	5658640	And by the way, yes, this does relate to video games, because this show is so huge.
5658640	5662040	There will be a video game based on it in six months, I guarantee it.
5662040	5663040	Oh, I'm sure.
5663040	5664040	I guarantee it.
5664040	5667040	So, um, so, so then now we have a new question.
5667040	5668960	When are you going to try out for The Voice?
5668960	5671280	August 24th in San Francisco.
5671280	5672480	Wow.
5672480	5673680	So you're doing it.
5673680	5674960	I'm actually doing it, yeah.
5674960	5675960	Oh my God.
5675960	5677680	There's a full campaign going right now.
5677680	5684600	I have a Facebook page, which goes by my, here you go, big moment on your ninth anniversary
5684600	5685600	show.
5685600	5687320	I'm going to reveal my real last name because-
5687320	5690280	Oh, even I'm not going to do that.
5690280	5693280	Because unfortunately there's no other way for me, and I couldn't just put myself as
5693280	5696880	Jessica Harper because I think Jessica Harper would get pretty pissed off.
5696880	5704280	So um, Jessica Friesen, um, if you go to facebook.com slash Jess Sings, um-
5704280	5705280	How many S's is that?
5705280	5706280	J-E-S-S-
5706280	5707280	Three.
5707280	5708280	Okay.
5708280	5709280	S-I-N-G-S.
5709280	5710280	Okay.
5710280	5711280	Four.
5711280	5712280	Well, yeah, if you can't throw it at the end.
5712280	5713280	Um, you can-
5713280	5714280	Rob, the master of the English language.
5714280	5715280	I know.
5715280	5718200	While she's auditioning for The Voice, I will be auditioning for Wheel of Fortune.
5718200	5721760	Rob is not the cunning linguist.
5721760	5724240	So you can go ahead and check out my stuff.
5724240	5726640	I actually have, uh, things on there.
5726640	5733720	Also on ReverbNation, um, dot com slash Jessica Friesen, um, that has not only the version
5733720	5738760	of Stay that Jamie had mentioned earlier, as well as the video of Rob and I doing that
5738760	5740320	infamous love shack.
5740320	5746080	Now keep in mind, again, the video, it was from VHS and it is 11 years old.
5746080	5747560	The years have not been-
5747560	5748560	Before we had DVD.
5748560	5752480	Yeah, the years have not been nice to the recording, but you still get the hint.
5752480	5757480	Um, and then there's also two recordings in there that are from when I was briefly with
5757480	5758480	the band as well.
5758480	5763800	So, um, vocals, lyrics that were written by me and obviously sung by me.
5763800	5766160	So yeah, please check it out.
5766160	5767160	Fan me and stuff.
5767160	5768160	Cause-
5768160	5770800	Yeah, let's, let's, um, let's, uh, Dark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind, would you post the link
5770800	5774480	in chat and, uh, chatters, if you wouldn't mind, let's help Jess out with some likes
5774480	5779120	and get her on The Voice because then when she wins, we can say it all started here.
5779120	5780120	Yeah.
5780120	5784840	The Reverb Nation page, thereverbnation.com slash Jessica Friesen, um, that actually is
5784840	5788160	what I gave to the people at The Voice as my page.
5788160	5789160	Nice.
5789160	5790160	As my music page.
5790160	5793880	So I had to have examples of my music and the more likes that I can get on there, the
5793880	5794880	better off I am.
5794880	5797080	And I'm already up in the 50 ish people now.
5797080	5799080	So if I can boost that up a little more.
5799080	5800080	A few more.
5800080	5801080	Yeah.
5801080	5802080	All right, let's do it.
5802080	5803080	Good luck to you.
5803080	5804080	And let us know how that goes.
5804080	5806400	You know, and sometimes I don't even know what to expect on those auditions, but you
5806400	5808600	know, there's going to be thousands of people there.
5808600	5811720	So if nothing else, go for the experience and have a blast.
5811720	5812720	Yeah.
5812720	5813720	So that's my whole intention.
5813720	5817600	I mean, I don't even expect anything to happen, but at least if I get out there and do it,
5817600	5821640	I can say that, you know, I tried, I at least gave it my best effort.
5821640	5825600	Well, Tiger Claw in our chat room says, if Jessica makes it big on American Idol, I hope
5825600	5827280	she will remember all those who knew her on OLR.
5827280	5830600	Well, I can guarantee you that won't be happening because she's trying out for The Voice.
5830600	5832160	Wrong show.
5832160	5836680	Anyhow, Salacious Pop has some karaoke requests for Jess and Rob.
5836680	5837680	Oh really?
5837680	5839480	So karaoke requests for Jessica and Rob.
5839480	5840480	Let's see here.
5840480	5842080	Close to You by The Carpenters.
5842080	5844000	No, I know what I want.
5844000	5845760	Why Do Birds?
5845760	5847160	I actually used to do it.
5847160	5851880	Part of my problem with Alone is that I am no longer the soprano that I used to be, but
5851880	5856640	you catch me with enough alcohol in my system, you might make that happen.
5856640	5860020	Love Will to Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille.
5860020	5863200	And lastly, Don't Go Breakin' My Heart by Elton John and RuPaul.
5863200	5868280	You know what, they need to show up because I have a Captain and Tennille song on my iTunes.
5868280	5869280	Thank you.
5869280	5870280	I have Muskrat Love.
5870280	5874440	But another, I could possibly get them to take it down a couple of notes, you know.
5874440	5878760	If I can get that highest note, like just a little bit further down.
5878760	5884280	Did you, okay, did you happen to watch American Idol when Carly Smithson was on?
5884280	5885280	Okay.
5885280	5887200	We'll get back to video games at some point.
5887200	5891280	She did Jesus Christ Superstar, but she's not, her voice isn't that high.
5891280	5899160	So she actually harmonized, actually did a countermelody part and got away with it.
5899160	5900160	So I love it.
5900160	5903440	Our buddy Travis is in chat or DJ Morpheus is in chat.
5903440	5908760	And in response to the whole Jessica saying, you know, we can say it's all started here
5908760	5909760	on OLR.
5909760	5911520	DJ Morpheus says, no, she won't.
5911520	5913560	She'll be wearing a USL shirt when she's on TV.
5913560	5915440	If she doesn't, she's fired.
5915440	5916440	Touche.
5916440	5921080	And technically, you know, the entire thing did start over there because I did officially
5921080	5922080	announce it over there.
5922080	5923080	I know.
5923080	5924080	Fair enough.
5924080	5925080	Fair enough.
5925080	5926080	But it would still be fun.
5926080	5927080	I'll be all right.
5927080	5929920	I embarrassed the shit out of myself with that bitch 11 years ago.
5929920	5930920	Exactly.
5930920	5933440	You just went from 52 to 58 in the last five seconds.
5933440	5934440	Awesome.
5934440	5935440	Thank you guys.
5935440	5936440	So there you go.
5936440	5938000	It may come in here worth it.
5938000	5940040	No, appreciate having you here.
5940040	5943640	And now we'll get that kind of response over on USL, you know.
5943640	5946400	Hey, you guys should listen to us all right now.
5946400	5947400	Oh, wait.
5947400	5949720	There's podcasts to listen to that.
5949720	5951520	I know, go listen.
5951520	5955160	Go start downloading right now.
5955160	5957960	Late breaking news as we get into part B tonight.
5957960	5962580	We're going to get into some video game news, but Loki, you were mentioning some late breaking
5962580	5966160	news just before we went live tonight, and this has to do with music games.
5966160	5970680	This is so big, I don't know how we didn't have it in the show before the news even came
5970680	5971680	out.
5971680	5976320	Ubisoft has announced their next big music franchise.
5976320	5977320	That's right.
5977320	5980920	You've got to wonder, how the fuck are they going to follow up Michael Jackson?
5980920	5988360	I mean, Michael Jackson, the king of pop, one of the greatest pop icons in the world.
5988360	5992040	On the anniversary of his death, nonetheless.
5992040	5995640	How possibly can we honor such...
5995640	5997000	How we go beyond that?
5997000	5998000	Who is actually...
5998000	5999000	Who will carry the torch?
5999000	6000520	Who will carry the torch?
6000520	6007480	And I am proud to announce the Black Eyed Peas will unfortunately carry the torch.
6007480	6015520	Yeah, so Black Eyed Peas Experience, ah, I can't even say that.
6015520	6024080	That will be coming out to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii soon.
6024080	6027560	I see, so what would the Black Eyed Peas Experience consist of?
6027560	6030380	Just a bunch of shitty sampling?
6030380	6038560	I got a feeling that this game's gonna suck my ball sack at this...
6038560	6040560	I have to repeat this.
6040560	6041560	What?
6041560	6045520	Tigerclaw said, and the only way to get Jessica back on OLR would be to have us contact her
6045520	6046520	agent.
6046520	6047520	I know, right?
6047520	6052680	Then next year it'll be Jessica the Experience, but that would be better than the Black Eyed
6052680	6054620	Peas Experience, that's for sure.
6054620	6057080	Is anyone excited about the Black Eyed Peas Experience?
6057080	6058080	No.
6058080	6059880	I'm sorry, I completely was ignoring all of that.
6059880	6063880	I'm sorry they're jacking my style.
6063880	6068640	Although I did see the best headline ever, can I share this with you guys?
6068640	6069880	Hold on, I put it on my Tumblr.
6069880	6074620	I don't talk about my Tumblr a lot because it makes me feel very hipster, but it's my
6074620	6075620	favorite thing that I've posted on Tumblr.
6075620	6077240	Are you drinking PBR?
6077240	6078240	In like a week.
6078240	6079240	I think you're okay then.
6079240	6085000	Here's the picture, it's a headline in a tabloid, it says, Fergie isn't pregnant, just really
6085000	6088000	likes tacos.
6088000	6093080	Now that's an experience I can get done with.
6093080	6094720	I'm reposting that right now.
6094720	6097880	That's what Tumblr's all about, I reposted it from Alan.
6097880	6101600	Let me post that, can I post that, how do I post that in chat?
6101600	6102600	You just copy...
6102600	6103600	Copy link location.
6103600	6104600	Yeah.
6104600	6105600	There you go.
6105600	6106600	There you go.
6106600	6107600	Hooked on internet, worked for him.
6107600	6111600	I think I might have put an extra slash at the end there, try that.
6111600	6112600	Alright.
6112600	6122200	So let's just pop in our chat room, it's just- What the hell did...
6122200	6131200	There will be no tumbling during the show, stop.
6131200	6132200	You post that in chat.
6132200	6134080	I officially adore your boyfriend.
6134080	6140680	Is that an anteater face, I can't quite- It's like a little mermaid, it's a little
6140680	6142720	mermaid meets Cyrano.
6142720	6144880	Oh no, no.
6144880	6151160	Well speaking of salacious pop in our chat room, he's reacting to the Black Eyed Peas
6151160	6156040	Experience News saying, OMG, I'm like Regina George when she spit out the Cal teen bar
6156040	6159240	and screeched in Mean Girls.
6159240	6166720	Anyhow, hey, we have spinoff shows, like I imagine you love Orange Lounge Radio so much
6166720	6168320	you want to listen to some other shows.
6168320	6172360	I mean we've plugged the shit out of Undersedation Live certainly, but Dark Soccer and I do some
6172360	6174280	other shows too we want you to know about.
6174280	6175280	Dark Soccer?
6175280	6179560	I do a podcast about comics where we don't really talk about comics that much anymore.
6179560	6180560	Because guess what?
6180560	6182640	The comic industry is lame right now.
6182640	6190040	But it's me and Tiara as Mar and Marvel, I almost said Marvin.
6190040	6191040	Marvin Morrill.
6191040	6193080	I'm going to blow you up.
6193080	6196480	My space modulator.
6196480	6198480	I am Marvin the Marvel.
6198480	6201600	No, I almost said Marvin Morrill.
6201600	6205320	And that just brings me straight to...
6205320	6209960	NERF 4!
6209960	6212160	Inside jokes for the win.
6212160	6215680	Marvin Marvel.
6215680	6217800	And Dan Shadow.
6217800	6223280	And we, if you have anyone up on Tuesday, we are at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net
6223280	6226560	and we want email eventually.
6226560	6228200	People email us please.
6228200	6233320	Because I don't have to read them, Tiara has to read them.
6233320	6236480	Make Tiara read your emails.
6236480	6238280	And also we have Twitter.
6238280	6245800	It's Comic Insanity, the letter N, not an I-N, on Twitter.
6245800	6251780	If you like the World of Warcraft and you want to hear a show more obscene than this
6251780	6258320	one, check out the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, Hoardhouse.com.
6258320	6263920	This week's show we had our buddy Sil, who is originally from Amsterdam but she now lives
6263920	6265800	in Britain.
6265800	6268540	Not the London part, she lives in not London, we call it.
6268540	6275500	And this week we got her to talk about ERP and an ERP story that will shock you.
6275500	6278000	So yep, we're going to get into all that on Hoardhouse.
6278000	6279000	Hoardhouse.com.
6279000	6280000	ERP.
6280000	6281000	It's awesome.
6281000	6282000	Also.
6282000	6283000	What?
6283000	6285520	There will be more stuff coming.
6285520	6286800	More podcasts.
6286800	6288320	You and your crypto stuff-o.
6288320	6291160	Well, you're in on it.
6291160	6292680	You're helping out, shit.
6292680	6293680	I disavow all knowledge.
6293680	6297560	Yeah, can we just skip the dwarven hand cannons please?
6297560	6301920	And DJ Morpheus always there to remind me in a who's your daddy kind of way.
6301920	6305480	Rob, Understation Live is not a spinoff, it's your father, bitch.
6305480	6307800	That's why we didn't plug it just then.
6307800	6308800	Oh.
6308800	6312080	He just wants you to get off his lawn.
6312080	6313080	Alright.
6313080	6314360	Anyhow, let's move on.
6314360	6316600	Waving his cane at you.
6316600	6318640	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
6318640	6322880	Some stories that we want to get through quickly because we want to spend more time not talking
6322880	6323880	about video games.
6323880	6326480	Loki, what do you got for us?
6326480	6327480	Ah, yes.
6327480	6332100	Since we were talking a little bit about music games before, I figured we might as well talk
6332100	6334060	about Rock Band.
6334060	6342120	At Rock Band, getting some new download content in the form of Poison Pack 1, featuring three
6342120	6349260	songs by Poison, including Nothing But a Good Time, Talk Dirty to Me, and Unskinny Bop.
6349260	6357480	And that's going to be $2 each, or 160 Microsoft points, or $5.49 for the whole pack, or 440
6357480	6358480	Microsoft points.
6358480	6360040	Whereas my every rose has a thorn.
6360040	6361440	Sorry, that's not...
6361440	6367120	And then also, of course, Three Doors Down, there's going to be a pack for them with the
6367120	6372440	songs Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and When You're Young.
6372440	6376800	Each of those $2, and you know, $5.49 for the whole pack.
6376800	6381280	And then of course, if that's not exactly your taste, you may check out the Rock Band
6381280	6387160	Network, where there's been a pretty neat addition.
6387160	6391880	They added Pac-Man Fever, among a bunch of other tracks.
6391880	6392880	Pac-Man Fever.
6392880	6397480	I was going to say, just a really quick side note, it's funny you mention every rose has
6397480	6398480	its thorn, Jamie.
6398480	6400800	That was my first slow dance ever.
6400800	6403420	Really, in 8th grade.
6403420	6404640	But guess what?
6404640	6410440	It's not just Pac-Man Fever, because the Buckner and Garcias also have Mouse Trap, Hyperspace,
6410440	6414600	and Froggy's Lament on the Rock Band Network.
6414600	6415600	Each of those two bucks.
6415600	6417640	But not doing the Donkey Kong.
6417640	6421720	No, I'm sorry.
6421720	6423840	And let's see here.
6423840	6429120	Other than Rock Band, some stuff coming to LA Noire, or I should say LA Noire is coming
6429120	6431520	to PC's this fall.
6431520	6435560	They're going to be doing, you know, kind of the Rockstar thing, improving the graphics
6435560	6437760	a little bit and adding 3D support as well.
6437760	6442600	That'll be coming out this fall, and I guess this fall is when I expect that we can hack
6442600	6446960	the crap out of that, because usually it takes the PC version to be able to break it open
6446960	6449720	on both console and PC.
6449720	6450720	Awesome.
6450720	6456600	And then finally, you better get on this quick if you're a Sonic fan, the Sonic Generations
6456600	6461040	demo is out now, but it will only be live for 20 days.
6461040	6467760	And actually, it's 20 days actually earlier.
6467760	6477680	So it will be running I guess from now through July 28th, and you can check it out on Xbox
6477680	6481480	Live Marketplace or the Playstation Network.
6481480	6487520	And also kind of going with that if you're in the Japanese region or have a jailbroken
6487520	6494600	phone or device, you can check out the iOS app that's available through the Japanese
6494600	6502400	app store, and it includes Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 and a minigame called Sonic the
6502400	6508080	Sketchhog as well as a news feed and weekly wallpaper downloads.
6508080	6514240	Sorry, I got distracted.
6514240	6516200	Fucking Tumblr, I swear to God.
6516200	6517200	What?
6517200	6519960	No, Tumblr is banned during the show.
6519960	6522040	This is the best one ever though.
6522040	6523600	Just look at Alan's Tumblr.
6523600	6525480	He posts the craziest shit.
6525480	6530960	Today I will get shit done by visitor LLLNOPE Tumbler.
6530960	6533120	Alright, moving on.
6533120	6534400	I'll show the chatroom.
6534400	6537840	Hey, this is serious news you guys.
6537840	6545720	Yu Suzuki has revealed in a Gamasutra interview, he is leaving his management position at AM2,
6545720	6549960	which is, you know, he will be, it's part of his company that develops games.
6549960	6556000	He will be at Sega as an advisor, but he will be kind of leaving his more management roles.
6556000	6557000	So there you go.
6557000	6558000	Do you see this?
6558000	6561240	Dan and Yu Suzuki.
6561240	6563600	So how does that make you feel as such a Yu Suzuki fan?
6563600	6569880	This was E3 like seven years ago.
6569880	6572200	He looks so young.
6572200	6575580	Are you sad or are you just like, oh, well, you know, these things happen?
6575580	6582680	As long as he's still, as long as his great influence will still be upon Sega, Sega will
6582680	6584320	never really die.
6584320	6591160	Well in more news, you can file next to Duh and of course PopCap, who in an unrelated
6591160	6597040	story, has, I guess, rumors going around that somebody wants to buy PopCap for $1 billion.
6597040	6598040	Please don't be Activision.
6598040	6601240	But yeah, apparently PopCap might be sold for $1 billion.
6601240	6603800	That actually isn't the story I was going to say.
6603800	6607880	Duh and of course Bejeweled 3 is coming to consoles.
6607880	6608880	Hey Rob.
6608880	6609880	What?
6609880	6611960	You know who's rumored to be buying PopCap, right?
6611960	6613480	I heard it was EA.
6613480	6614480	Zynga.
6614480	6615480	Oh God.
6615480	6616480	Sheez.
6616480	6617480	Barf.
6617480	6622480	Speaking of Sega and Zynga, I was driving home from San Francisco last night and as
6622480	6626640	I got on the freeway, I drove by the old Sega building that now has the Zynga logo on it.
6626640	6629640	I cried.
6629640	6636760	Bejeweled 3 on the DS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in the last quarter of 2011, of course
6636760	6639480	you know that Bejeweled 3 is coming.
6639480	6642840	And one of these games, you better get it or else it's going to be gone.
6642840	6645720	And this was kind of a big one, TMNT.
6645720	6647840	That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the hipsters.
6647840	6649280	TMNT re-shelled.
6649280	6652440	It will no longer be available after June 30th.
6652440	6653980	This is your last chance to buy it.
6653980	6656040	It will be gone in a few days time.
6656040	6657620	This has to do with licensing.
6657620	6661000	It's not that it's getting delisted because it sucks.
6661000	6664320	Which I don't even know if any games ever really were delisted because they suck.
6664320	6665860	Usually it's a license thing.
6665860	6670660	But if you want to get TMNT re-shelled, which was the arcade game but kind of redone graphics
6670660	6673720	and so forth, get it now.
6673720	6674720	Or never get it.
6674720	6676920	Those are your choices.
6676920	6678800	Dark Sakura's got some rapid fire news for us.
6678800	6681560	Then we'll get to the Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash OLR.
6681560	6686220	Well this should make a lot of fanboys, you know, need new panties.
6686220	6690560	New Dragon Age 2 download content is going to be available.
6690560	6691560	Five achievements.
6691560	6697680	There's actually no new, no price on it quite yet, but the achievements will be for a total
6697680	6699400	of 120 points.
6699400	6704880	That is conduct or defeat an ancient evil in the Denmark mountains.
6704880	6707740	Deep root safari, kill a bunch of stuff.
6707740	6710960	Family legacy, apply three effects to Hawk's Key.
6710960	6715360	Family outing, that's the main quest in the mountains with Bethany or Carver in the party.
6715360	6718920	And towns, you know, actually I got Carver killed and didn't really give a shit about
6718920	6720140	Bethany.
6720140	6726880	And tower sweeper, where you do every side quest in the mountain prison tower.
6726880	6734300	Then there's actually a public monument being made to Gary Gygax, who is one of the creators
6734300	6736120	of D&D.
6736120	6740200	And it is in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
6740200	6745280	It better be a huge mungus D20.
6745280	6747240	And it better be a natural 20.
6747240	6751920	It better be a 12-sider, because dude, it's all about playing warrior class.
6751920	6754320	I'm kidding, I played mages.
6754320	6760640	And last but never least, more Wii U news.
6760640	6766800	Every single time somebody says that, I always hear in my head the chick from Kung Pao.
6766800	6768800	Of course.
6768800	6775560	Anyway, Masahiro Sakurai is basically quoted as saying that another Smash Brothers game
6775560	6779480	is years away for Wii U and 3DS.
6779480	6783880	They're putting all of their effort into Kid Icarus Uprising.
6783880	6791460	And he said that it makes him cringe that he's got more projects on his plate.
6791460	6792460	What makes him cringe?
6792460	6795700	The fact that they're announcing games like five years before they're coming out.
6795700	6797260	Is that the part that makes him cringe?
6797260	6800920	The fact that he's, I don't know, just putting his credibility online.
6800920	6803880	Hey, by the way, we're going to have a new Mario game.
6803880	6806560	Mario's going to come out and be alive in your house.
6806560	6809840	Oh, that's not coming out for 50 years though.
6809840	6813460	The quote, it makes me cringe that I'm not sure it's the smartest thing to make gamers
6813460	6815160	wait for several years.
6815160	6819440	But the early announcement was made chiefly in order to attract new team members.
6819440	6822700	We've got no plans whatsoever, we've got two new games out there in the open when there's
6822700	6824680	no extra time to work on them all.
6824680	6828200	So basically he's being pretty upfront about it, saying, I don't know why they told you
6828200	6829820	all this early, but here you go.
6829820	6832280	To attracting new team members.
6832280	6833280	Apparently they need work.
6833280	6837320	Well, there's people over here who don't have jobs who can design pretty well, and I'll
6837320	6839120	design your manual for you if you pay me a lot.
6839120	6842840	I would think that they would be able to put that up on, I don't know, a job posting or
6842840	6848480	something like that instead of saying, hey, fans of, hey, guess what, fans of Smash Brothers.
6848480	6849740	There's a game coming.
6849740	6852840	Would you rather have someone working on a project that actually cares about the project
6852840	6854920	or somebody who's just worried about throwing out crap?
6854920	6860200	Well, I would have, I'd rather they care about it, but also rather they, I don't know, don't
6860200	6862600	announce it before you have even started the game.
6862600	6864800	I think it was more- It's an inevitability anyway.
6864800	6867800	I was about to say the same thing, I was thinking more in the name of inevitability, new Nintendo
6867800	6872440	console, yeah, of course, we're going to put our new Smash Brothers, but we'll do it later.
6872440	6874720	Hypothetically, games that are going to be coming out then.
6874720	6878160	I mean, since they're out there- Microsoft did it too.
6878160	6881720	They announced Alan Wake with the 360 five years later.
6881720	6883920	Okay, but it was probably in development.
6883920	6888800	It wasn't something that they said, eh, well, you know, there's a difference between delay,
6888800	6893960	delay, delay, and the difference between, yeah, well, we haven't really started the
6893960	6894960	game yet.
6894960	6897560	I mean- It's just, so we wrote it down on a piece of paper.
6897560	6898560	You know it's coming out.
6898560	6899560	You know we're going to.
6899560	6900560	We just haven't started on it.
6900560	6904220	Hey, wouldn't you guys like a Smash Brothers game on the 3DS?
6904220	6905440	We would too.
6905440	6907920	So that's why we're going to work on one someday.
6907920	6915960	It's like, that's what Nintendo was announcing at E3, shit that they don't even have started
6915960	6916960	yet.
6916960	6920600	They're probably on the drive in or walking up on it and saying, hey, you know what, we
6920600	6923720	should tell them that there's a new Smash Brothers coming out.
6923720	6924720	Yeah.
6924720	6932520	All right, let's get to some Twitter topics, twitter.com slash o-l-r, tweet, tweet, tweet,
6932520	6933520	every week.
6933520	6939200	We need you here every week just for that part.
6939200	6944000	Every week you guys send us tweets, but only tonight we'll just sing.
6944000	6947200	Twitter.com slash o-l-r, we have a handful of tweets tonight.
6947200	6952040	I want to start tonight with a completely random tweet from Flaming Toilet who sends
6952040	6958480	us a tweet that's a retweet from Agent M. Behold, the 25th anniversary DVD collection
6958480	6964280	of the Golden Girls and we get linked to a post on Yes Tumblers, which is I guess this
6964280	6968120	Golden Girls collection that comes in a gigantic purse.
6968120	6973560	It's all seven seasons on DVD with a deck of playing cards as well.
6973560	6976160	Better come with like a gift certificate to Cheesecake Factory.
6976160	6977160	When's that coming out?
6977160	6978160	Soon.
6978160	6979160	I don't know.
6979160	6980160	I didn't see the date.
6980160	6981300	I would think that Applebee's would be more appropriate.
6981300	6983440	But I loved Flaming Toilet's comment.
6983440	6988320	Now if we could just get them to include an official game in that box set.
6988320	6989320	Yeah.
6989320	6990320	I'm hoping.
6990320	6994040	And don't forget about maybe having the first season of Golden Palace.
6994040	6995040	Oh God.
6995040	6996040	Do you remember that?
6996040	6997040	Yeah.
6997040	6998040	Oh, they linked it to Amazon.
6998040	6999040	Oh, gee.
6999040	7001040	The low, low price of 182 bucks.
7001040	7002040	Geez.
7002040	7003040	Let's see.
7003040	7004040	When is it out?
7004040	7006040	That is still cheaper than Deep Space Nine for the record.
7006040	7007040	It's out.
7007040	7008040	I don't know.
7008040	7009040	That's a lot of Betty White.
7009040	7010040	It's out now.
7010040	7011040	In stock.
7011040	7012040	Buy it now.
7012040	7013040	It's my birthday.
7013040	7014040	Just saying.
7014040	7015040	All right.
7015040	7020680	Moving on, let's see, going to S2 100 Matt.
7020680	7027920	A guy is shipping himself 2,000 plus miles in a crate while playing Lord of the Rings
7027920	7028920	online.
7028920	7031500	Surprisingly for a good cause too.
7031500	7033800	This might be relevant to Jessica's interests.
7033800	7035040	Yeah, exactly.
7035040	7039480	Yeah, we were just talking earlier about shipping Drunami in a crate.
7039480	7040480	Which server, dammit.
7040480	7041480	There he is.
7041480	7044640	He's in a crate playing on a PC there.
7044640	7047320	That is not comfortable looking.
7047320	7048320	What's his name?
7048320	7054160	Performance artist, Jordan Wayne Long, starting on July 7th, he will be confined to a small
7054160	7055420	wooden box.
7055420	7062260	He's being shipped from Bald Knob, Arkansas.
7062260	7063260	He's going to...
7063260	7064880	And we're back to the penis joke.
7064880	7068800	Being all alone in that box, he's going to have a Bald Knob by the time he's done.
7068800	7073000	Well, you know, there's only so much you can do during, you know, but it is summer festival,
7073000	7074620	so...
7074620	7076800	You're going to get bored of Lord of the Rings online eventually.
7076800	7079240	A man's got needs.
7079240	7081680	Bald Knob, Arkansas to Portland, Oregon.
7081680	7083880	Just picture him finding some cute little elf.
7083880	7084880	It will be...
7084880	7085880	Oh yeah.
7085880	7086880	Oh yeah.
7086880	7087880	He'll be...
7087880	7091920	He'll have to find which port to put his Bald Knob in.
7091920	7093720	Why the fuck is he doing it?
7093720	7096460	The reasons apparently are mixed.
7096460	7099520	He wants to provide entertainment through his Twitter account.
7099520	7104120	He also aims to better understand post-traumatic stress disorder.
7104120	7106520	Many individuals who experienced traumatic events...
7106520	7107520	What?
7107520	7108520	Is this a joke?
7108520	7109520	Are you going to tell me this is a hoax?
7109520	7110520	No, no.
7110520	7111520	It's not a hoax.
7111520	7112520	Here's why he's doing it.
7112520	7114200	Attention whore is why he's doing it.
7114200	7115200	Because he's a poor artist.
7115200	7120720	I'm doing an art project where I'm going to ship myself in a container and play Lord of
7120720	7121720	the Rings.
7121720	7123400	It worked.
7123400	7130780	How is being in a shipping container while having entertainment, and at least you have
7130780	7136060	one luxury, how is that causing PTSD in any way, shape, or form?
7136060	7137960	How are you going to have post-traumatic stress disorder?
7137960	7139800	He's playing Lord of the Rings online.
7139800	7146560	If you want to get PTSD, why don't you play Black Eyed Peas The Experience?
7146560	7148520	I don't get this.
7148520	7153100	I hope they put him in one of those shipping containers up in the airplanes where they
7153100	7158160	have no oxygen and sub-zero freezing temperatures and he freezes to death.
7158160	7160160	That's what I hope happens to this guy.
7160160	7161960	He freezes to death.
7161960	7166240	I wish him death by freezing.
7166240	7168040	Now if that does happen, you're going to feel a little bad.
7168040	7169040	No, I'm not.
7169040	7170040	I'm going to laugh.
7170040	7171040	I'm going to laugh.
7171040	7176240	I'm on the record right now saying I will laugh my ass off for at least five minutes.
7176240	7183360	Maybe to break it to you, but I don't think there's any major airports in Bald Knob.
7183360	7184360	If there was.
7184360	7185360	Yes, there is.
7185360	7186640	Bald Knob International.
7186640	7190560	I don't think anybody could ever take it seriously if they had to take a flight from there.
7190560	7193720	They have flights every day to Toronto and Guadalajara.
7193720	7197160	The views expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those of all the staff
7197160	7200160	of Orange Lawns Radio.
7200160	7201760	Right?
7201760	7208080	And Frisbee says that can't be more than a four to five hour flight.
7208080	7210000	Dude, he's shipping himself UPS.
7210000	7211000	That's the problem.
7211000	7212000	That's why it's going to take seven days.
7212000	7214520	He's going to get lost, dumped in the ocean, you know.
7214520	7217920	They'll leave him on some back porch somewhere.
7217920	7218920	Hold on.
7218920	7219920	Hold on.
7219920	7222220	So why is he able to ship himself via, you know, UPS?
7222220	7223680	Because I'm pretty sure they have policies against him.
7223680	7226640	I don't know how he's shipping himself, but I just assumed it was UPS.
7226640	7227640	Old Dominion.
7227640	7231840	So I hope they're shipping him because they will lose that package.
7231840	7234000	Alright.
7234000	7237360	Tiger Claw links us to some stories here real quick.
7237360	7239440	Remember GeoHot?
7239440	7240440	That's right.
7240440	7245720	The man behind the Sony PlayStation debacle when Sony was going to sue him.
7245720	7248600	Probably the whole reason why Sony got hacked a couple months ago.
7248600	7251440	Apparently, he's come out of this okay.
7251440	7254360	He's got a development gig now at Facebook.
7254360	7260320	Yeah, this was, I guess, validated by a group called Techmeme.
7260320	7261320	I don't know.
7261320	7266560	But they tweeted a link to his private Facebook wall, which apparently called Facebook an
7266560	7268840	amazing place to work.
7268840	7271600	So it'll be interesting to see what he cooks up over at Facebook.
7271600	7275960	Also, one other link here from Tiger Claw on Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r.
7275960	7278080	Gameplay Theater Festival.
7278080	7279920	Speaking of performance art, here we go.
7279920	7284020	It combines gaming and performance art.
7284020	7287600	If you're in Brooklyn, oh God, haven't these guys done this shit before?
7287600	7291700	I remember a Brooklyn theater and something about gaming.
7291700	7293880	But the Brick Theater is going to be doing gameplay.
7293880	7299520	It's a theater festival comprised of gaming-oriented stage productions, musical performances, and
7299520	7301880	interactive performance art.
7301880	7302880	Let's see.
7302880	7305080	There's Romeo and Julietette.
7305080	7307700	It's a modern interpretation of Shakespeare's classic.
7307700	7311960	It will be performed entirely within World of Warcraft.
7311960	7319000	Modal Kombat uses real guitars to control Mortal Kombat characters.
7319000	7320280	There's a YouTube.
7320280	7321280	I could play it.
7321280	7323500	Why don't they actually do a good Shakespeare play?
7323500	7327600	Or I could go to the last tweet tonight from ActDeft.
7327600	7328600	Here's a good question.
7328600	7330640	A question for our nine-year anniversary show.
7330640	7332000	I like this.
7332000	7338640	What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?
7338640	7342880	What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?
7342880	7344080	I'll start with Loki.
7344080	7345080	He's opinionated.
7345080	7348200	I don't know.
7348200	7349200	Come back to me.
7349200	7350200	I'll think about this.
7350200	7351200	Dark Sakura?
7351200	7356280	Nothing's really surprising, you know?
7356280	7362720	It's anything that's exciting is cyclic because they're always, it's always going to be, I
7362720	7366720	read them on E3, all this stuff, blah, blah, blah, and then all of this blah, blah, blah.
7366720	7368340	So it really is going to go in a cycle.
7368340	7371160	It's nothing stays really crazy.
7371160	7378080	I guess the monumental news of the whole nine years is that I'd like WoW now.
7378080	7382160	The most impactful news of the past, well, let me go to the guests first before I say
7382160	7383160	my opinion.
7383160	7384160	Anybody?
7384160	7385160	Jiranami?
7385160	7386160	No?
7386160	7387160	Jess Carper passing?
7387160	7388160	I don't know.
7388160	7389160	Anything you guys didn't think of?
7389160	7391300	I'm going to go along with Jamie's line of thinking of, oh my goodness, I'm actually
7391300	7396040	playing an MMO, which for anybody who knows me is pretty shocking.
7396040	7399720	Maybe the advent of the MMO, if you will, over the past nine years.
7399720	7404560	I mean, granted Ultima online is a little bit over nine years old, but maybe the mainstreaming
7404560	7409560	of the MMO, it really, it would definitely be in the top five, I think for me.
7409560	7413360	It really, it really did like, and I've said so on the show before, but I've used to play
7413360	7418320	Gemstone back in the day when it was on AOL and you had to pay to play Gemstone when you
7418320	7420000	had to pay to do AOL by the hour.
7420000	7425800	See, my first, when I first started into tech support and the whole IT world, I was surrounded
7425800	7427940	by guys who were playing EverQuest.
7427940	7430680	So that was all I ever heard about was EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest.
7430680	7434800	And it was because of them that I swore off any kind of MMO ever.
7434800	7440120	And here I am many, many, many, many years later and I'm addicted to Lotro.
7440120	7443000	So I don't know.
7443000	7450120	For me, the most impacting Xbox Live is the biggest story I think that's happened in nine
7450120	7451120	years.
7451120	7457000	It took the Xbox particularly seriously until Xbox Live changed console gaming and not only
7457000	7459960	changed console gaming, it killed arcades.
7459960	7464160	And it changed the way we commune as a community.
7464160	7467920	And it's, you know, been imitated by other places.
7467920	7473240	I think Xbox Live, it's part of the reason we have what, Dark Soccer's favorite word
7473240	7476160	microtransactions now is because of Xbox Live.
7476160	7479960	Xbox Live, I think is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years.
7479960	7485280	And I'm still thinking just the whole really pushing the internet too.
7485280	7488800	How long do you think it'll actually be before they just give up on the concept of arcades
7488800	7489800	altogether?
7489800	7494780	I don't think they ever will because the ticket gambling things will always be there.
7494780	7499000	And I think there will always be a pinball machine in a bar.
7499000	7504440	Well, at the same time though, just while I was going through Roseville Golf Land, I
7504440	7509360	always make notes when I see new tick redemption games as well.
7509360	7511320	And there were only one or two.
7511320	7515080	It seems like even those are starting to slow down a little bit.
7515080	7519680	However Pachinko in Japan is still big.
7519680	7523600	The most surprising for me is kind of a tie.
7523600	7526760	I would say the Nintendo Wii.
7526760	7529860	Just the fact that Nintendo did it.
7529860	7536280	They had a vision and they were right and love them or hate them for it, they did it.
7536280	7540200	And the rise of Facebook games I think is very surprising.
7540200	7543640	Farmville might be the most surprising thing of the past nine years.
7543640	7546360	Again, love it or hate it, your grandma's playing it.
7546360	7552960	I have to go with the fact that Nintendo had this neat system that they developed called
7552960	7554200	the Revolution.
7554200	7556840	And at the last minute they thought, hey, you know what's a better name?
7556840	7561580	Wii.
7561580	7563640	And also Giant Enemy Crabs.
7563640	7565040	Some of the chatters disagree with me.
7565040	7569080	I can't see how Xbox Live killed arcade gaming because you didn't have to leave the house
7569080	7570580	to go be with other people.
7570580	7571580	That's why I say that.
7571580	7576080	I mean, granted, it's one of several things that probably led to that.
7576080	7580100	But I think it made that whole community gaming, you didn't have to really leave the house
7580100	7581100	to do it.
7581100	7584360	And that goes right hand in hand with the whole internet MMO thing.
7584360	7587320	I think those are closely married together.
7587320	7592200	Just thinking back to the way things used to be, the arcade used to be a place that
7592200	7594160	people would go to hang out.
7594160	7598960	Even before when, you know, we were actively playing as a group at Roseville Golf Land
7598960	7601000	and what have you back in the day.
7601000	7606520	Earlier than that, you know, people were like, there's, at Birdcage Center, this is a place
7606520	7610520	that we used to have a Rocky at, they had an arcade.
7610520	7615980	It was one of the best and it was the thing to do was you would hang out and you would
7615980	7620740	either go to the bowling alley, to the movies, or you would be hanging out in the arcade.
7620740	7627360	And it was the social, basically the social mecca of that entire area.
7627360	7634760	So I think that essentially the internet and all of, you know, the MMOs, Xbox Live, what
7634760	7639000	have you, all of that has really, really led to the decline.
7639000	7644320	I mean, it's nice to, you know, on a whim go to the arcade with your friends, but it's
7644320	7648280	not someplace you're going to be spending every single night like we were back in our
7648280	7649280	DDR days.
7649280	7651000	It just doesn't happen.
7651000	7652000	Yeah.
7652000	7655760	So, and again, folks in the chat room still disagreeing with me over Xbox Live killing
7655760	7656760	arcade games.
7656760	7658440	I'll give you that concession.
7658440	7661600	It didn't single handedly do it, but I still stand by my answer.
7661600	7664300	Xbox Live's the most important thing that happened in gaming in the past nine years.
7664300	7667060	And again, the Xbox would have failed without it.
7667060	7670680	People did not take the Xbox seriously until you played Halo 2 online for the first time.
7670680	7674960	I mean, there was, of course, some people bought the system, but it did not take off
7674960	7675960	until Xbox Live.
7675960	7681840	And I think that really actually started, I think, from the Dreamcast, because a lot
7681840	7686040	more online games for a console came out with the Dreamcast.
7686040	7689600	We had Phantasy Star Online in Japan, which didn't support their broadband adapter over
7689600	7690920	here, which was shitty.
7690920	7692620	Quake 3.
7692620	7696040	So many games started coming out toward the end of the Dreamcast Live that used the online
7696040	7697040	support.
7697040	7698720	But Xbox Live centralized it, and that was huge.
7698720	7699720	Exactly.
7699720	7702240	See, that's what I'm saying is that the concept was there.
7702240	7704200	Sega was starting to push it, and you notice how quick...
7704200	7706560	Xbox didn't invent it, they just perfected it.
7706560	7709400	Oh, Microsoft's way of gaming.
7709400	7711640	They don't think of it always, they just perfect it.
7711640	7717280	But in Japan, they had the Satellaview for Super Nintendo, where you could play online
7717280	7718600	games.
7718600	7720960	And what was the thing called for the Genesis?
7720960	7721960	The X-something.
7721960	7726220	Do you know what I'm talking about?
7726220	7729360	The online Genesis thing that they had?
7729360	7730360	Sega Channel.
7730360	7731360	Yeah, Sega Channel.
7731360	7732840	But it was starting there.
7732840	7737120	They had the right idea, and then I think it was just like, well, people are wanting
7737120	7738120	to do this.
7738120	7740120	Let's make it happen, and let's make it happen in a big way.
7740120	7741600	And that's where Xbox came in.
7741600	7745200	They basically took what everyone was thinking and like, okay, here.
7745200	7747240	Yeah, I think Black Wolf sums it up pretty well.
7747240	7750160	It didn't catch on with the Dreamcast, and it didn't catch on with Sega Channel.
7750160	7752060	I mean, it was a great idea, but it didn't catch on.
7752060	7754200	It needed Microsoft for the marketing.
7754200	7757440	And you know, that centralization, I think, is again the key word there too.
7757440	7759560	All right, let's move on past Twitter topics.
7759560	7761240	Let's get into some more gaming news.
7761240	7764760	We have some more stories for you guys, FUs of the Week coming up as well.
7764760	7767000	At some point, we'll have a mailbag too.
7767000	7772240	And then, of course, the calls, the Skypline at 1-877-GAME-OLR, but not just yet.
7772240	7773240	First some stories.
7773240	7774240	Loki.
7774240	7780680	Yes, there's a class action lawsuit against Sony, of course, about the PlayStation Network
7780680	7782160	outage.
7782160	7789320	It is alleged, though, that part of this lawsuit is because they're saying that layoffs had
7789320	7793400	an effect on the PlayStation Network making it vulnerable.
7793400	7800640	Apparently, it says that a Sony online entertainment platform engineer claims that Sony's technicians
7800640	7805880	only installed firewalls on an ad hoc basis after they determined that a particular user
7805880	7810680	was attempting to gain unauthorized access to the network.
7810680	7817000	And it says also that, I guess, Sony spent lavishly on security measures for its own
7817000	7822800	PlayStation dev network and didn't put the same effort or budget into securing users'
7822800	7823800	data.
7823800	7828400	Because they only seem to care about themselves.
7828400	7834200	And also, I guess, that they enacted large-scale layoffs in March of this year, just weeks
7834200	7837240	before the massive data breach.
7837240	7839840	Hmm.
7839840	7842320	That's a little coinkydink.
7842320	7852480	Um, yeah, so there's a whole lot of not nice things that are going on there.
7852480	7854520	I'm making Rob laugh.
7854520	7855760	Tarzara's teaching me sign language.
7855760	7857840	I thought I was going to say, no incur.
7857840	7861320	Well, what do you think, though?
7861320	7864280	Is this really to blame for why PlayStation Network went down?
7864280	7865280	I don't know.
7865280	7868160	I think just people really want to kick Sony while they're down, and this just seems a
7868160	7869160	little bit like...
7869160	7872880	I mean, if they're spending a lot of money and time to secure their other network that
7872880	7877840	has stuff that's important to Sony, but yet the stuff that's important to their consumers,
7877840	7881840	like I don't know their personal information, they just leave wide open, then yeah, that
7881840	7883480	does sound like a problem to me.
7883480	7886940	I think at the end of the day, you know what I always say on this show, hackers gonna hack.
7886940	7894120	And I think after everybody was very angered by the removal of Linux, I don't even think
7894120	7898540	if they could have had the higher security facility in the world, they probably still
7898540	7900240	would have found a way to get in there and hack it.
7900240	7901240	You know?
7901240	7902240	I just...
7902240	7903240	I don't know.
7903240	7904240	Not that it makes it right.
7904240	7905880	Sony had every enemy in the world at that point.
7905880	7909320	That's also like saying, you know, well, I left my doors unlocked in my house, so that's
7909320	7915200	why I got robbed, you know, versus, oh, well, my house was locked up like Fort Knox and
7915200	7918400	had a security alarm and all this stuff, and I got robbed.
7918400	7923600	Well, you know, that kind of security does deter people from hacking.
7923600	7930520	And you know, I mean, we can, you know, put out a bunch of what if scenarios out there
7930520	7935600	for a whole, you know, bunch of things that they could have done, but they didn't do any
7935600	7938400	of them, so we don't really need to.
7938400	7942280	Stupidity in terms of security aside, you still don't blame the victim.
7942280	7944860	All right.
7944860	7948540	You can't say, oh, well, it's just, you know, why secure banks?
7948540	7950080	Bank robbers are gonna rob banks.
7950080	7954240	I mean, that's, that's dumb.
7954240	7955240	All right.
7955240	7956240	Well, let's move on.
7956240	7959760	Uh, you know, there was a lot of talk about, uh, this whole halo connect thing.
7959760	7964400	You remember the domain connect halo.com made everybody say, oh God, Microsoft's working
7964400	7965800	on a halo game with connect.
7965800	7970080	And then the halo anniversary edition was rumored, ultimately announced, and a lot of
7970080	7973920	people assumed that it was going to have connect integration, but they didn't show it at E3.
7973920	7978620	Well, apparently, uh, there is this whole, I guess, thing going around that there's a
7978620	7985400	better for connect, I guess, thing going on with, uh, the new halo game and, uh, Microsoft
7985400	7991420	studios, Phil Spencer, who's the boss there, uh, mentioned with game spot as a first party.
7991420	7995160	We believe that connect will be important to all genres of games.
7995160	7998700	Even games like halo anniversary has connect integration.
7998700	8004360	So you can say confirmed connect integration with halo anniversary, but it may not be what
8004360	8005360	you think.
8005360	8010560	There was a forum admin BS angel, like that name, uh, on the halo waypoint forums.
8010560	8015240	Uh, one of the admins said about halo anniversary's connect integration, just to let everybody
8015240	8020040	know the connect features we're exploring with halo anniversary are optional and won't
8020040	8022720	affect your core gameplay experience.
8022720	8027660	Our mission from day one has been to deliver a faithful recreation of the original game.
8027660	8030920	And we remain dedicated to seeing that through to completion.
8030920	8034520	This says to me that the connect stuff they're looking at integrating probably has nothing
8034520	8040840	to do with the game itself, but it's going to be like voice commands in the menus or
8040840	8043160	I don't know, maybe using the connect to some microphone.
8043160	8049000	So you can say obscenities to all the people on Xbox live from your couch or just little
8049000	8051040	dumb things that will connect.
8051040	8057000	No, I don't even think that just, or yeah, maybe a color for your outfit based on the
8057000	8058400	actual shirt you're wearing.
8058400	8060560	Just really stupid shit like that.
8060560	8062120	That paint master chief.
8062120	8063120	Yeah.
8063120	8069240	And I think that's the type of stuff now we're looking at is literally things tacked on to
8069240	8071160	just say, Hey, this game uses connect.
8071160	8074560	You know, it would be neat to do a map editor using connect.
8074560	8079280	Yeah, but I don't see a halo map editor happening period, but it just occurred to me that it
8079280	8084520	would actually be cause you say move tree here because of forge member for just part
8084520	8089040	of the, or you could just go play Minecraft.
8089040	8090740	I had a nightmare about Minecraft.
8090740	8091880	You had a nightmare about Minecraft?
8091880	8092880	I sure did.
8092880	8095440	Did the goblins get through to your house or any of that stuff?
8095440	8098200	The goblins all had internet troll faces.
8098200	8100200	I'm not even joking.
8100200	8103280	Penis man in our chat room says, I don't care if they add connect to halo.
8103280	8106920	As long as I can play it with just a controller as the halo lover I am.
8106920	8109280	There you go.
8109280	8112480	And black Wolf says face mapping under your helmet.
8112480	8113520	It's technology.
8113520	8114520	So good.
8114520	8118200	You can't even tell it's there anyhow.
8118200	8120480	Also real quick about halo.
8120480	8124040	There is flaming helmets coming to halo reach.
8124040	8125040	That's right.
8125040	8129120	If you register on bungee.net or through the recently released iOS app, you have until
8129120	8135600	the end of July 7th to get a flaming bungee head on fire, blue flame thing for halo reach.
8135600	8136800	You can get that.
8136800	8141080	And there's this cute little PSA they made about it from of course, red versus blue.
8141080	8144680	So guess what, Jessica, I can play halo and be flaming.
8144680	8147440	Hello, I'm flaming.
8147440	8150200	I'm playing halo.
8150200	8153720	It's fabulous.
8153720	8156280	Dark Sakura, you have some news for us?
8156280	8157280	I have mail.
8157280	8158800	No, I've got news.
8158800	8159800	You have mail.
8159800	8160800	Excuse me.
8160800	8161800	Burn the mail.
8161800	8162800	Okay.
8162800	8165920	We got some birthday wishes in the mailbag.
8165920	8171960	Bit.Trip Saga and Bit.Trip Complete are being done on the 3DS and Wii and will be out on
8171960	8175080	the 13th of September in the US.
8175080	8178120	But there's no European publisher yet.
8178120	8179120	Sadness.
8179120	8182880	But we'll have it here so everybody in Europe import it.
8182880	8186480	Those Bit.Trip games won't go away at all.
8186480	8190920	You know, like those Bit.Trip games have been coming out for like years and years, but a
8190920	8193040	lot of them are pretty cool, I got to say.
8193040	8194040	Bit.Be.Trippin?
8194040	8197080	I like Bit.Trip Beat, even though they've released it like as many times as Bejeweled's
8197080	8200000	been released on all these different platforms, but still kind of an eet game.
8200000	8202000	Bit.Be.Trippin.Beats?
8202000	8204000	Block Rockin' Beats.
8204000	8205720	All right.
8205720	8207200	Before we get to some more news.
8207200	8209320	Oh, look, it's the mailbag music.
8209320	8210320	It must be time.
8210320	8211320	Dang it.
8211320	8212320	I almost closed, oh, I closed everything.
8212320	8213320	My bad.
8213320	8214840	I don't think so.
8214840	8216240	Every week you guys send us emails.
8216240	8220320	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com and sometimes I remember to put it on the show roll because
8220320	8223320	this is a show where every gamer has a voice, usually.
8223320	8225320	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
8225320	8228400	I know why you didn't do it because last week you read it and you thought that I might have
8228400	8230680	laryngitis again this week.
8230680	8231680	Well guess what?
8231680	8233600	I did it out of consideration for you.
8233600	8235680	Yeah, well.
8235680	8237600	This is from Rabba.
8237600	8240840	Here's one of the few stories that link games with less violence and crime.
8240840	8245800	My take is, my take on this is, this is just a theory not scientific study.
8245800	8250400	The only difference is they who, they can compare video game proliferation against the
8250400	8254720	crime rates dropping by year, which is more objective data than the games cause violence
8254720	8260920	wingnuts, which only seem to use handpicked data from poorly designed experiments.
8260920	8268360	And this actually comes from BBC, which honestly, world news from BBC is probably one of the
8268360	8269880	best sources to get it from.
8269880	8270880	It's the BBC.
8270880	8275200	Well, keep in mind, you want your dry news, you get it from the BBC.
8275200	8278680	Without any of the, you know, sensationalism.
8278680	8282160	Tonight on the BBC, blah blah blah, etc, etc.
8282160	8284560	But I've covered this on the show before.
8284560	8285560	I think I'm coming.
8285560	8286560	Oh.
8286560	8287560	Oh.
8287560	8288560	Oh dear.
8288560	8291200	Isn't it nice to have a penis?
8291200	8293840	Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?
8293840	8299640	In 19, okay, it says 1985 crack market recruits youngest sellers and it's a relatively low
8299640	8301040	rate then.
8301040	8305280	1991 peak murder rate, crack demand starts to fall.
8305280	8315080	And it, it is actually, as of right now, the crime rate is lower for murder, that is, than
8315080	8317680	it was in 1970.
8317680	8322600	And it hit its peak in, I think, around 19, yeah, 1991, 1982.
8322600	8329320	And that robbery rates are also just slightly higher than murder rates, but still far low
8329320	8331520	what they were in 1970.
8331520	8333440	And that's coming from the FBI.
8333440	8334840	You know what that means, though, Rob.
8334840	8340120	You know, on Wall Street you're hearing, sell crack, sell crack, sell crack, sell crack.
8340120	8342080	I'm posting a link to this in the chat room.
8342080	8346840	But I've covered that on the station before, because there was actually someone who did
8346840	8352720	an independent study using a number of different resources, including the FBI and various local
8352720	8356560	police accounts that came to the same conclusion.
8356560	8359160	Guess what came out in 1991?
8359160	8362360	The NES, I do believe, in the United States.
8362360	8363360	In 91?
8363360	8366680	91, no, the Super Nintendo.
8366680	8368120	Super Nintendo.
8368120	8372720	Unfortunately crack will be on the rise again and it's all thanks to video games.
8372720	8376020	Thanks to a new video game that's going to be coming out this holiday season.
8376020	8378080	It's called Being Bobby Brown.
8378080	8379080	Let's take a look at a clip.
8379080	8380080	We got to live with stars.
8380080	8381080	We got to live with the anthrax.
8381080	8382080	Oh, you just watch too much TV.
8382080	8383080	I'm a true American.
8383080	8384080	I've been to jail before.
8384080	8385080	That's American.
8385080	8386080	Kiss my ass!
8386080	8387080	You kiss my ass?
8387080	8388080	Kiss my ass!
8388080	8389080	Fucking love that song.
8389080	8390080	Yeah, everybody.
8390080	8391080	Bobby!
8391080	8392080	And, uh.
8392080	8393080	Bobby!
8393080	8394080	Bobby!
8394080	8395080	Bobby!
8395080	8396080	Bobby!
8396080	8397080	Bobby!
8397080	8398080	Bobby!
8398080	8399080	Bobby!
8399080	8400080	Bobby!
8400080	8401080	Bobby!
8401080	8402080	Bobby!
8402080	8403080	Bobby!
8403080	8410400	Bobby! and I.
8410400	8413400	Whitney Houston, the experience coming out.
8413400	8415440	Where's my drugs?
8415440	8416440	I'll tell you what.
8416440	8422120	Whitney Houston, the experience would be better than Black Eyed Peas, the experience.
8422120	8423120	I'm sorry.
8423120	8425840	It would be, there's some of the experience there.
8425840	8426840	That's for sure.
8426840	8430120	Well, anyway, they're, they're attributing some of this to the Obama effect, meaning
8430120	8438280	that they're saying that having a, a black president is better, uh, a better role model.
8438280	8441200	Where's my Kurt Cobain experience?
8441200	8443240	And then there's a fall in demand for crack.
8443240	8445480	It'd be a short game.
8445480	8446480	Smarter.
8446480	8449360	Obama being president means there's less of a demand for crack.
8449360	8450840	I'm going number by number.
8450840	8451840	The story's reaching.
8451840	8455560	Smarter, uh, policing.
8455560	8463160	Better tracking of numbers so that they can actually keep the flow of criminality down.
8463160	8467120	Increased availability of legal abortion.
8467120	8471680	And more criminals behind bars.
8471680	8477360	Reducing of lead in gasoline is decreasing exposure to children, which is also contributing
8477360	8479040	to a fall in violent crime.
8479040	8480800	The Baby Boomers grew up.
8480800	8482000	And video, okay, now this is it.
8482000	8483160	This is the important one.
8483160	8487160	Number nine, a study released last month suggested video games were keeping young people off
8487160	8490360	the streets and therefore away from crime.
8490360	8496200	Researchers in Texas working with the Center for European Economic Research said this incapacitation
8496200	8501780	effect more than offset any direct impact the contents of games may have had in encouraging
8501780	8502780	violent behavior.
8502780	8506280	So what you're saying is then they're just too fat to go outside and kill each other?
8506280	8507280	Pretty much.
8507280	8508280	Too lazy.
8508280	8509280	Nah.
8509280	8511280	It's, it's, it's more that-
8511280	8515360	I'd fucking kill you, but I'm feeling really high.
8515360	8521560	And also the last one on there, and actually I like this one, the proliferation of camera
8521560	8522560	phones.
8522560	8527320	Meaning, oop, someone's robbing the ATM.
8527320	8528320	Snap.
8528320	8529620	Just saying.
8529620	8530620	Next email.
8530620	8531620	Hey.
8531620	8532620	It's pretty valid.
8532620	8538200	And at least it's better supported than, you know, all those other, you know, games are
8538200	8539600	making my kids rob me right here.
8539600	8544720	And at the same time, the amateur porn market is thriving due to camera phones.
8544720	8548000	Okay, this comes from Holly.
8548000	8551560	Has there been anything on Microsoft's next console?
8551560	8555120	Do you think they are just keeping it under wraps or that maybe they haven't made anything
8555120	8556520	this time around?
8556520	8557520	Under wraps.
8557520	8558520	Maybe.
8558520	8561240	I'd be kind of interested in seeing a portable from Microsoft.
8561240	8566320	With the DS things have been coming out lately, I'm just not feeling Nintendo anymore.
8566320	8570120	Nintendo seems to be focusing way too much on gimmicky things and way less on quality
8570120	8571120	of games.
8571120	8575760	No, not you, I'm sorry, I'm posing for a picture for two.
8575760	8576760	Okay.
8576760	8581080	My husband and I both recently got rid of our DS lights in all the games.
8581080	8584400	He had just bought the new Pokemon game but got bored with it after a week since it's
8584400	8586400	pretty much the same game all over again.
8586400	8589200	Actually, we also gave away our Wii to my mom as well.
8589200	8591060	She's using it to watch Netflix.
8591060	8594100	But when our Xbox died, we freaked and ran immediately by another one.
8594100	8598280	It's already Red Ringed once, didn't know if they'll cover it a second time.
8598280	8605880	That's just saying, you know, we loaned out our Wii, but we've got three Xboxes now.
8605880	8613120	As far as the new Xbox goes, there's gonna be tight-lid secret on that until at least
8613120	8617580	next E3, maybe even one more, and it all has to do with not wanting to cannibalize sales
8617580	8619760	of the current Xbox.
8619760	8623040	Why would you buy an Xbox today with Kinect if you know something better is coming out
8623040	8624040	next year?
8624040	8629280	There's a lot of people incentive to wait, so I'm gonna say that's your number one reason.
8629280	8632560	It's not, to be honest, that's not specific to Xbox.
8632560	8636000	PlayStation 4 has been in development for years, I guarantee it.
8636000	8639120	You're just not gonna hear about it for a little while, because they don't want to cannibalize
8639120	8640580	the PlayStation 3.
8640580	8642760	Such is how the game industry works.
8642760	8644400	Good lord, people.
8644400	8645400	Okay.
8645400	8646920	Hey, OLR crew!
8646920	8650560	AZHP here with congratulations and salutations for another year of OLR.
8650560	8655160	I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate your birthday and your roots than an addition
8655160	8656160	of Where Are They Now?
8656160	8658280	Bay Area DVR Players.
8658280	8665780	FanaMacon was, a few weeks ago, Milton, Maple, and Gary, who was Shintengi, practically run
8665780	8667000	the show and I love them for it.
8667000	8670240	Wendell is a trooper and ran Stage Zero day and night to keep folks in the convention
8670240	8671240	center entertained.
8671240	8676520	And speaking of Stage Zero, the DS players, a dance crew formed mostly of old DVR freestylers,
8676520	8678600	took the stage and blew everyone away.
8678600	8685760	No longer satisfied to dance on panels in time to arrows the likes of AJ Sweetbanana,
8685760	8691000	John Chaos, James Captain Canada, Lawrence Fuzzyhat, and many more cosplayed as random
8691000	8695840	completely non-anime related characters like Jesus, Jackie Chan, The Terminator, and Tigger
8695840	8699840	while popping, locking, and breakdancing to the tunes of 8-bit remixes and old school
8699840	8700840	funk.
8700840	8704560	They put on an amazing show and they inspire me to become a better dancer.
8704560	8708360	There was still stepping on arrows to be had as Jonas Explicit, who's been on the show
8708360	8715560	quite a few times, who now runs the Big Anime Game Room, or Teabagger for short, at most
8715560	8720000	Bay Area conventions, hosted a DVR freestyle tournament to try and relive the good old
8720000	8721000	days.
8721000	8725320	To prove that freestyle is dead, no one cared if you failed or even hit the arrows because
8725320	8730200	no one here remembers how to dance and step on arrows at the same time.
8730200	8733560	Bruce Leroy showed up and brought it back old school, but Chaos won with some excellent
8733560	8734560	locking.
8734560	8738600	Mel B and Rain provided some sweet tunes at the Fanime Rave, and were the only two DJs
8738600	8741120	who played music that anyone can dance to.
8741120	8745800	I won't get into how I feel about anime con rave music here, but suffice to say that Mel
8745800	8748600	B and Rain are following their passion of music.
8748600	8751960	By the way, if you're really lost right now, these are all people that were very much like
8751960	8756800	win, place, and show in the DVR tournaments of our day, so if you didn't follow that scene,
8756800	8757800	you're a little lost right now.
8757800	8761760	And I'm pretty sure that Hitori Hanzo was also part of the rave crew as well.
8761760	8762760	Yes.
8762760	8767960	But I want to say, for those that were, this is a great email.
8767960	8770520	Let's lose people further with a resounding, hi guys!
8770520	8771520	Shut up.
8771520	8773240	I'm actually totally...
8773240	8775160	I wanted to go to Fanime this year, but it didn't work out.
8775160	8778400	I'm going to Fanime next year, I don't care.
8778400	8782320	Finally at Kentucky Con in Sacramento last weekend, I ran into Lil B, who showed up for
8782320	8785200	a dance competition to win a thousand dollar grand prize.
8785200	8788720	For those who don't know, Lil B started dancing seriously around four or five years ago.
8788720	8792740	From what I can hear from his sister, he dances all day and all night and wins dance competitions
8792740	8793740	all over the Bay Area.
8793740	8798440	There was some fierce competition at Kentucky Con, but Lil B came out on top to claim the
8798440	8799440	grand prize.
8799440	8803320	That man is still like five feet tall, but now he has transformed into a compact ball
8803320	8806760	of pure energy that exists only to dance and win.
8806760	8810480	Also I went to Sviggle for the first time in about five years, and Corey Virtu was still
8810480	8811480	there playing 2DX.
8811480	8814720	It's nice to know that some things never change in life.
8814720	8816160	Zing.
8816160	8817520	Except he's married now.
8817520	8818520	Can you believe that?
8818520	8824200	Didn't he like come just walk by you randomly one day and go douche or something?
8824200	8827120	Uh, no, I think that was the other douche.
8827120	8828120	I don't know.
8828120	8831320	Or somebody, you know, somebody else did that and I was like, what?
8831320	8834000	Let's talk about happier subjects.
8834000	8836200	He did the, the, the bag of flour.
8836200	8838160	Who did the bag of flour?
8838160	8839160	That was Changer.
8839160	8840160	That was Changer.
8840160	8841160	That was.
8841160	8842160	He didn't.
8842160	8844120	I thought that Corey did something else.
8844120	8848460	Anyway, my brain, okay.
8848460	8849960	It's nice to know some things never change in life.
8849960	8853380	I hope you all enjoyed my edition of Where Are They Now?
8853380	8857000	The prevailing theme is that the freestylers are still dancing just without the aid of
8857000	8858240	arrows and a dance pad.
8858240	8862380	Definitely check out the DS players on YouTube and we'll be locking as well.
8862380	8865920	The way I see it, if a bunch of anime nerds who liked a dancing video game become one
8865920	8868760	of the best crews in the Bay Area, anyone can learn to dance.
8868760	8870240	Happy birthday, OLR, and I love you all.
8870240	8872480	You're truly AZHP.
8872480	8873480	Great email.
8873480	8874480	Yes.
8874480	8875480	Worth.
8875480	8876480	For, for like 5% of the audience.
8876480	8877480	I need some lighter.
8877480	8879760	For everybody in this room.
8879760	8880760	Yes.
8880760	8881760	Exactly.
8881760	8882760	Memories.
8882760	8883760	Okay.
8883760	8884760	Hi, all.
8884760	8885760	Hi.
8885760	8886760	Hi.
8886760	8887760	Hi.
8887760	8890200	First off, I want to thank you guys for giving me so many tips for a horror point and click
8890200	8891200	game.
8891200	8892200	I started with Amnesia, The Dark Descent.
8892200	8894280	I've never been so scared in my life.
8894280	8897080	When my husband, who stood right behind me, said something to me, I shrieked and almost
8897080	8899680	punched him in his manly hood.
8899680	8902240	I would say your suggestion was a great success.
8902240	8905640	Secondly, congrats on producing such a great podcast for nine years.
8905640	8909160	I only hope that we perhaps can look forward to another nine years.
8909160	8915880	I have two questions for, I have two questions for all of you.
8915880	8919840	Since I'm an MMO addict, what do you think of the upcoming MMO, The Secret World?
8919840	8923040	I'm hoping it will be really good, Horcrux, Lulu, etc.
8923040	8926640	But I do fear that it might not be as good in the end as I want it to be.
8926640	8928720	A bit what I got with Conan.
8928720	8931840	My second question, in these nine years of podcasting, what have you guys learned about
8931840	8932960	yourselves in podcasting?
8932960	8935000	Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?
8935000	8936000	Friends of love, Sil.
8936000	8937000	P.S.
8937000	8940600	I'm still going to Ninja Dark Sakura for an interview on Girls Gone Wow.
8940600	8941600	I'm down for it.
8941600	8943920	Those are two completely different questions.
8943920	8946760	The Secret World, I don't know much about it, but I'm doing a little bit of reading
8946760	8947760	on it.
8947760	8950700	And it sounds like it's the folks that made Age of Conan, so it ties into that.
8950700	8955060	And Anarchy Online, it's being made for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.
8955060	8961080	And there's no levels, no classes, it's all skill-based, so you don't have to level grind.
8961080	8966040	And I guess there's several side quests and all that typical stuff you know on MMO.
8966040	8968640	I don't know much about this game.
8968640	8971680	I don't think they showed it in E3 this year, or if they did, it was a little bit under
8971680	8972680	the radar.
8972680	8974160	So I don't know enough about it to really comment on it.
8974160	8976280	I want to total call a Cthulhu MMO.
8976280	8981640	I hope it's better than the Conan MMO was.
8981640	8984560	Ju just said what I was seeing, where you're never going to get a character past level
8984560	8985560	five.
8985560	8986560	What was the second question?
8986560	8989640	The second question was something about podcasting itself, right?
8989640	8992560	What have you guys learned about yourselves and podcasting, and do you have any tips for
8992560	8993560	the rookies out there?
8993560	8994560	Oh, God.
8994560	8998240	I've learned that I have a high tolerance for bullshit now.
8998240	8999240	Not really.
8999240	9000640	I don't have a high tolerance for bullshit.
9000640	9005740	That's kind of a wide question, considering how much the whole process of quote-unquote
9005740	9009200	podcasting has changed over the last nine years as well.
9009200	9010200	That's true.
9010200	9011200	There was no podcasting when OLR started.
9011200	9013320	Yeah, there was no such thing as a podcast.
9013320	9018200	There was just broadcasting on live 365, and boom, there you go, shoutcast server galore.
9018200	9023440	I will tell you one big thing that I've learned just from being a quote public figure, because
9023440	9030640	we would get emails from complete strangers, that when someone is saying that you need
9030640	9036280	to go back to the kitchen and that you're bringing down the podcast, it's sort of like,
9036280	9038200	well, they don't know shit about me.
9038200	9039200	I don't care.
9039200	9043640	It was that point where I was like, I don't really care.
9043640	9045520	I can take whatever comes my way.
9045520	9049880	I've got a lot of people supporting me, and really, those are the people that I'm doing
9049880	9050880	this for.
9050880	9051880	Yeah.
9051880	9052880	Haters going to hate.
9052880	9053880	Exactly.
9053880	9054880	That was the big thing.
9054880	9055880	Haters going to hate.
9055880	9059320	And for every troll out there, look at the chat room.
9059320	9063640	People that are spending their Sunday nights listening to some schmoes on the internet
9063640	9064640	talk about hate.
9064640	9065640	They could be in church.
9065640	9070040	I mean, that's why to be here, but let me give you the number one piece of advice.
9070040	9075080	I could do a podcast on podcasting, but let me give you the number one piece of advice.
9075080	9076920	Maybe two pieces of advice.
9076920	9081480	Number one, don't do a podcast because you want to be famous.
9081480	9084520	If you're doing it for that reason, you're doing it for the wrong reason.
9084520	9085520	Trust me.
9085520	9086520	You're getting into a very bad-
9086520	9087520	I quit.
9087520	9088520	Thing.
9088520	9093400	And the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio, the very first hundred episodes of
9093400	9098480	Orange Lawns Radio were for 12 people, but they were 12 people that were giving up their
9098480	9101160	Sunday nights to come listen to what we had to say.
9101160	9105800	And it was like hanging out with your friends at dinner, at Brookfield's, Denny's, whatever
9105800	9106800	the place is.
9106800	9109120	Some of us still podcast to 12 people.
9109120	9110120	Exactly.
9110120	9111120	And if you're not-
9111120	9112120	But we love it.
9112120	9113120	And that's the whole purpose.
9113120	9117680	Because those are 12 bad-ass people that you're having fun with.
9117680	9124920	So podcast because you like that sense of community, no matter how big your community
9124920	9125920	is.
9125920	9129200	I made a lot of friends all over the world.
9129200	9130200	And they've sent us this.
9130200	9131200	It's not porn.
9131200	9132200	I did.
9132200	9133200	It's in that box.
9133200	9134200	No, it's not in that box.
9134200	9135520	Do podcasting to get porn.
9135520	9138920	There's actually not that box, but that box over there still has some of the stuff.
9138920	9139920	I know.
9139920	9140920	I know.
9140920	9141920	Podcasting porn.
9141920	9146360	And then honestly, as far as the actual production of a podcast, quote unquote, my big thing,
9146360	9147360	be enthusiastic.
9147360	9152760	And you don't have to be like, oh my God, you guys, I'm so excited about games.
9152760	9157000	No, just sound like you want to be doing a podcast.
9157000	9158000	Fabulous.
9158000	9159000	What's that?
9159000	9160000	Fabulous.
9160000	9161000	No, for real.
9161000	9165160	Like, just, just, I can't tell you how many podcasts I've heard where it's like, okay,
9165160	9173400	so welcome to episode number five of Game Casts and we're going to talk about video
9173400	9174400	games.
9174400	9176120	Would you like fries with that?
9176120	9180320	You know, it's just like, sound reasonably happy.
9180320	9185520	And I realize sometimes we're very harsh critics about video games here on the show, especially
9185520	9188800	that guy sitting over there when it comes to Nintendo, but don't mistake.
9188800	9189980	Don't talk to Drew like that.
9189980	9190980	Don't mistake enthusiasm.
9190980	9191980	Fuck you, buddy.
9191980	9197720	A lot of that is, when I say enthusiasm, a lot of that is really passion.
9197720	9201320	Have a passion for what it is you're talking about.
9201320	9202760	Even if you're talking about nothing.
9202760	9205080	Or talking out your ass.
9205080	9208920	We rant and we rave because we actually give a damn.
9208920	9209920	Talking out of my ass?
9209920	9210920	What are you talking about?
9210920	9215520	And don't do what I used to do every few years and do nothing but read Harry Potter books
9215520	9216520	during the podcast.
9216520	9221760	SSTA 100 Matt in Chat says, I don't even remember what I did on Sunday nights before OLR.
9221760	9223840	That's how long I've been listening to OLR, seven or eight years.
9223840	9224840	I remember what I did.
9224840	9225920	I slept.
9225920	9230160	I used to go to the goth club with Jessica.
9230160	9234800	Yeah, that's why I was never around on Sundays.
9234800	9235800	Funny enough.
9235800	9237840	Ironically, that goth club sucks now, so.
9237840	9238840	I know.
9238840	9242920	Well, I was just thinking about that two weeks ago because I heard about it in passing or
9242920	9246720	something and I was just like, God, I haven't been there in nine years.
9246720	9248280	Yeah, it's still going.
9248280	9251000	But it sucks now.
9251000	9252500	It's all teeny boppers.
9252500	9253500	Baby bats.
9253500	9254500	Yeah.
9254500	9256040	Complete batlings.
9256040	9257680	I'm more goth than you.
9257680	9261080	Either that or I'll wear less clothing than you.
9261080	9265140	Did I tell you about me going to bat stay at Disneyland?
9265140	9266620	It was sad.
9266620	9270120	It was a bunch of little hot topic.
9270120	9271120	Baby goths.
9271120	9272120	Burn down.
9272120	9277160	I slept for this one chick who was wearing full black Victorian garb with the bustle
9277160	9281880	and everything, pushing her baby in a lace covered pram.
9281880	9283280	It was the most adorable thing.
9283280	9286200	I was like, okay, you're doing actual gothic.
9286200	9287200	Yeah.
9287200	9291680	I'm catching up on some of the chat comments from chat.orangelandsradio.com because I was
9291680	9296280	busy chatting about that last email and I'm catching up with your chats and I want to
9296280	9298280	say this and then we can maybe go on to the next email.
9298280	9301240	I love this comment from dark Tetsuya in the chat room.
9301240	9304880	This is about the haters going to hate line that a dark soccer was talking about.
9304880	9305880	Yeah, really.
9305880	9309440	You've been doing the radio podcast thing for nine years.
9309440	9312840	What have they done with themselves in that time?
9312840	9318440	They just right on dig, you know, and that was the whole thing is like the moment that
9318440	9323300	I saw the sort of misogynistic comments, I was like, it has nothing to do with any type
9323300	9327880	of talent or anything that I said they're going to be little, you know, dickless, you
9327880	9334000	know, dick, peons wonder.
9334000	9335000	Next email.
9335000	9336000	Okay.
9336000	9337000	I'm actually replying to, to stills.
9337000	9338000	I say something.
9338000	9339000	Look, I'm sending her my email.
9339000	9341160	Oh, still was the guest on Horde house and she was fabulous.
9341160	9345960	I'll reply to it later, but I'm sending still my re my regular email so that, oh, you girls
9345960	9347800	going to chat offline about pillow fights?
9347800	9349640	No, about me being on girls gone.
9349640	9350640	Wow.
9350640	9351640	Oh, okay.
9351640	9352640	That's a fun show.
9352640	9353640	Yeah.
9353640	9354640	She wants to go wild on girls gone.
9354640	9355640	Wow.
9355640	9356640	Mm hmm.
9356640	9360480	I want you to take your top off, get the record for the record.
9360480	9365080	My tune has already danced mostly naked in front of the Lich King.
9365080	9366080	Keep your ass out of gold.
9366080	9367080	Try her.
9367080	9371760	There's pictures of my tune dancing naked in front of the Lich King before you go on
9371760	9372760	girls gone.
9372760	9373760	Wow.
9373760	9374760	I need you to do some research.
9374760	9378320	I want you to roll a character on the moon guard server, take off all your clothes and
9378320	9382600	run to gold Shire and just, just watch.
9382600	9383600	Really?
9383600	9389240	See, now you're giving me ideas, Rob, you realize you got on brandy wine.
9389240	9392520	You realize that when we get back from pink Berry, that's the first thing I'm fucking
9392520	9397800	straight from our chat to Bree all the way to the Shire completely naked.
9397800	9398800	Just saying.
9398800	9399800	Damn it guys.
9399800	9400800	Moon guard used to be good.
9400800	9405800	We'll take technically they, um, they, uh, we'll shoot, um, I'd have to get to storm
9405800	9406800	wind too.
9406800	9407800	Is it from storm wind to gold Shire?
9407800	9408800	I'll win the gold Shire.
9408800	9409800	Yeah.
9409800	9413760	Let's roll a human next scene naked.
9413760	9414760	Oh God.
9414760	9415760	Okay.
9415760	9417920	Dear OLR, I have nothing intelligent to say.
9417920	9418920	Okay.
9418920	9419920	By email.
9419920	9420920	Okay.
9420920	9422200	But as a long time listener, I would like to wish you all a happy birthday and thank
9422200	9423720	you for your dedication.
9423720	9427160	Running for almost a decade is an incredible achievement.
9427160	9430520	Sometimes I wonder how much an effect your show has had on me as I've grown up considering
9430520	9433240	I've been listening since I was 14 or so.
9433240	9435760	It's been the positive, positive one though.
9435760	9436960	I'm glad you think so.
9436960	9441880	I wonder what your parents think, please continue to do your show until the universe collapses
9441880	9445480	in on itself or until at least the sun goes large enough to swallow the earth.
9445480	9446800	Elliot the Afro guy.
9446800	9451440	Oh God, I can't, I, I, there's been a few people, there was an iTunes review recently
9451440	9455000	that said, but by the way, we love five star reviews on iTunes and I gotta say one of the
9455000	9458800	most recent ones that's there is somebody that was literally saying, I grew up on your
9458800	9464880	show and like I, I really can't wrap my head around that comment.
9464880	9469920	Like I know it's a compliment and I'm very thankful about it, but I literally can't Rob
9469920	9475320	what you grew up on this show.
9475320	9476680	No think about it.
9476680	9477680	Okay.
9477680	9483000	When you first started, when we first went off back in 2000 to the Rocky horror convention,
9483000	9484000	you were what?
9484000	9485000	22.
9485000	9486000	Yeah.
9486000	9489760	I still don't think you sir have grown up on this show.
9489760	9490760	It's true.
9490760	9494400	I, I can, I can agree that from, for myself because honestly when you're in your twenties
9494400	9497040	you're still sort of in that teenage drama.
9497040	9499120	It's why I can't listen to the old episodes at OLR.
9499120	9501320	Like everybody always asks like, when are you going to post episode one?
9501320	9502840	It's not that I'm embarrassed of episode one.
9502840	9504040	I love episode one.
9504040	9505120	That's just not you anymore.
9505120	9514400	If I listen to it, I go that guy then I want to punch him in the face.
9514400	9518000	I know I feel the same way going back on my left journal.
9518000	9524440	I mean, you, you, you want clear cut evidence, how much I've grown you like,
9524440	9525440	Mr. young Republican.
9525440	9526440	Seriously.
9526440	9529280	It's just take, well, at least he's more of a young libertarian.
9529280	9530280	Okay.
9530280	9532280	I like my 2004 shit.
9532280	9536000	This guy had hair longer than mine.
9536000	9537000	I got lazy.
9537000	9538720	It actually looks good on you.
9538720	9544080	I'm due for another haircut anyway, but anyway, but I think, I think I can say safely that
9544080	9550160	in ever since all of this started, cause I can, I'll even go back to, to usl.
9550160	9553680	Cause that's, that's where I got my start was guessing on usl a whole bunch too.
9553680	9554680	Oh sure.
9554680	9559240	I mean, usl kind of, I w I will say for all the shit I've given Travis over the years
9559240	9562920	and all this, and he says, you know, sometimes I refuse to acknowledge the show, whatever,
9562920	9563920	which you know, isn't true.
9563920	9569800	I love or understation live, but let me say this about understation live is ceremoniously
9569800	9571480	passes the mic back over to me.
9571480	9573400	No, no, it honest.
9573400	9578240	It showed me that there is an audience.
9578240	9579600	There's an audience for tickling guys.
9579600	9581600	What the hell are you talking about?
9581600	9590600	You know, it definitely was the enabler because KCSC was one thing that was about trying to
9590600	9594560	get into these pictures from that, by the way, that's when I thought I would be a radio
9594560	9595560	DJ.
9595560	9596560	Like that would be my gig.
9596560	9602040	That was going to be my life was, you know, waking up with Rob on 97.7 this right here
9602040	9607320	is more reasons why you should listen from time to time because we even went so far back
9607320	9613560	as Travis found the video from when we were on the news, when we were interviewed by Christina
9613560	9620040	Warner because we were doing this, this thing that was so unique, that was never heard of
9620040	9621040	in Sacramento.
9621040	9622400	It was such a unique thing.
9622400	9627880	And now, you know, everybody in their dog has a podcast, but we were doing it way back
9627880	9628880	when.
9628880	9629880	You know what it makes me think of?
9629880	9632200	Oh, it's so much fun.
9632200	9636880	By the way, that was the greatest moment in nine years of orange on radio.
9636880	9637880	I will say it was that.
9637880	9640240	Oh, it's so much fun.
9640240	9645000	One of my favorite movies is a lot of our old school listeners know is pump up the volume
9645000	9646000	and it started it.
9646000	9648440	But in the movie, it started with one guy with his shortwave radio.
9648440	9653460	And at the end of the movie, everyone picked up a shortwave radio and wanted to get their
9653460	9654460	voice out there.
9654460	9657840	And that's kind of what I see things happening with the people who jumped onto podcasting
9657840	9663600	right away and how it grew from there is that people are really finding that there's people
9663600	9665720	who listen to what they have to say.
9665720	9671360	Still think we have a better audience than any kind of tickling guys ever could get.
9671360	9673320	I will also say this about conversation live.
9673320	9680120	The episode where we randomly called the bunny ranch and ended up talking to dude for like
9680120	9687960	Dennis was trying to get me to go there for free and was possibly easily one of the top,
9687960	9688960	maybe the top.
9688960	9689960	Oh, yeah.
9689960	9690960	Thing that has ever.
9690960	9691960	Oh, yeah.
9691960	9692960	On Internet radio for me.
9692960	9698480	You know, one of my favorites was on USO calling Disneyland when there were phones in the park.
9698480	9704960	And then the Disney, you know, we we've actually been trying that recently, but it's so hard
9704960	9707280	to find a live phone line in Disneyland anymore.
9707280	9709320	Yeah, it's all so all of them.
9709320	9710320	The only.
9710320	9711320	Don't forget when we called Iraq.
9711320	9712320	Yes.
9712320	9713320	Iraq.
9713320	9716640	We called a hotel in Iraq and we tried to book a hotel room for George Bush.
9716640	9717720	Yes, I remember Charles.
9717720	9719080	We're coming to get you.
9719080	9720080	That's terrible.
9720080	9721080	Totally funny.
9721080	9722080	All right.
9722080	9724640	Hey, whose birthday show is this?
9724640	9725640	Okay.
9725640	9726640	Last email.
9726640	9727640	All caps.
9727640	9730640	Bobby wishes all our happy birthday with a birthday taco.
9730640	9731640	Tacos.
9731640	9732640	All caps.
9732640	9733640	Bobby.
9733640	9735120	That's how you have to read.
9735120	9736120	He's not pregnant.
9736120	9737120	He just really likes tacos.
9737120	9738120	That's how you have to read.
9738120	9739120	All caps.
9739120	9740960	I'm going to save the Bobby comments for his show.
9740960	9743200	I always read Bobby's emails last.
9743200	9745880	He's got a six year anniversary and 300 episodes.
9745880	9746880	He's having a sex-a-versary.
9746880	9748480	Thank you, Bobby.
9748480	9751880	But now I think I'm all lowercase.
9751880	9757240	All right.
9757240	9758240	Is that it for emails?
9758240	9759240	Yarp.
9759240	9760240	Thank God.
9760240	9761240	No.
9761240	9762240	No.
9762240	9763240	No.
9763240	9764240	No.
9764240	9765240	No.
9765240	9766240	No.
9766240	9767240	No.
9767240	9768240	No.
9768240	9769240	No.
9769240	9770980	Bobby was amongst all this talk of the bunny ranch.
9770980	9772640	All right.
9772640	9777140	Yes, unfortunately no bunny ranch came to transition into that, but we can talk a little
9777140	9778400	bit about Bungee.
9778400	9782980	Bungee's doing the kind of anniversary of Halo thing right now.
9782980	9784780	Or I guess anniversary of Bungee.
9784780	9786800	20 years of Bungee.
9786800	9792400	And with that, a guy by the name of Daniel Bleszek.
9792400	9797540	He's been working on an iPad port of Marathon.
9797540	9804000	And I guess basically now it's almost ready to go and it's pending Apple's approval right
9804000	9807560	now for the low low price of zero dollars.
9807560	9813580	And if that isn't enough, apparently they're also releasing the final game of the marathon
9813580	9817900	trilogy Infinity to the open source community.
9817900	9822960	So maybe that will also come to the iPad since it'll be open source and someone can port
9822960	9823960	it over.
9823960	9824960	Pretty awesome.
9824960	9833700	Alright, and then, um, let's see, yeah, that's it for now.
9833700	9837160	Alright, let's move on to a story about Silent Hill Downpour.
9837160	9842540	Well guess what Silent Hill Downpour, or as some are calling it Silent Hill Alan Wake,
9842540	9846340	Silent Hill Downpour will not have Pyramid Head.
9846340	9848380	Aww, you guys, you guys know Pyramid Head, you love it?
9848380	9849940	And it will not be good either.
9849940	9854460	Unfortunately some of the people that played it at E3, I'm not hearing a whole lot of it,
9854460	9857220	but it will have 100% more corn in it.
9857220	9861820	It will have guns and they're saying they're treating the gun like the gun in the road
9861820	9864940	by Cormac McCarthy.
9864940	9867480	There is a gun, but there are only three bullets.
9867480	9868980	So how will you use them?
9868980	9869980	Hmm.
9869980	9872060	Well, that was kind of always what Silent Hill was about.
9872060	9876020	It was never about confronting things head on, but about, you know, what do you run from
9876020	9877020	and what do you take on?
9877020	9882060	And I don't know if that's, that doesn't sound like a totally new concept to me, but whatever.
9882060	9890820	So yeah, so there won't be Pyramid Head, but there's supposedly will be some other scary
9890820	9891820	people.
9891820	9892820	Whoopee.
9892820	9893820	Alright.
9893820	9894820	Dark Sakura.
9894820	9902500	You have to make, you know, a nice wide path for Shermy so she can waddle on through.
9902500	9903500	Yeah.
9903500	9904500	Poor baby.
9904500	9905500	Okay.
9905500	9915300	Valve likes the Wii U. Confirmed, Valve likes Wii.
9915300	9926220	Gabe Newell said at New York's Games for Change Festival, that they like the Nintendo Wii
9926220	9932220	U and he's quoted as saying Wii U seems to be a lot more powerful than the previous generation.
9932220	9937400	It sort of fits better into the scalability in terms of graphics performance and CPU performance,
9937400	9941940	so I think it'll be a lot easier for us to fit into our scalability model.
9941940	9944220	We've always loved Nintendo.
9944220	9950780	So they're saying that they are still looking into different console counterparts, starting
9950780	9955300	with the 360 and recently moving to the PS3.
9955300	9960420	They're saying that the Wii U is going to be scalable.
9960420	9965220	Maybe in Portal 3, you can be GLaDOS with that whole little screen thing.
9965220	9968180	All you control is the camera angle in the little room.
9968180	9969180	Now you're the troll.
9969180	9974340	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9974340	9992620	It's the part of the show where we get Inkstein.
9992620	9998020	FU to the remnants of my sinus infection deciding to move into my lungs.
9998020	9999420	Evicted!
9999420	10006460	Um, FU to having a headache.
10006460	10013220	Um, FU to the fact that I see a lot of things at Pride festivals that make me not have a
10013220	10014220	lot of pride.
10014220	10020620	And I'm talking about just drunk bitches that just go to get drunk and take their top off.
10020620	10026020	Like it's just, I can't stand, it's like a frat party, some of that shit that I see going
10026020	10029740	on in the streets and it's just, it's just dumb.
10029740	10030740	I don't know.
10030740	10032820	It doesn't make me happy.
10032820	10035860	You want to show your pride protest something.
10035860	10037340	That's how it all started.
10037340	10041940	Uh, Jessica Harper, any FUs of the week you want to get out?
10041940	10049940	Um, FU to judgmental types.
10049940	10050940	And Drew Nami.
10050940	10056220	Uh, FU to completely sucking any sort of a sales job.
10056220	10057220	Lost my job.
10057220	10058220	Oh well.
10058220	10064540	And FU to scheduling conflicts and not being able to seem to be able to get money for all
10064540	10068740	these great games and other essential shit I need to get done.
10068740	10071140	At least a lot of them are going free to play.
10071140	10072140	That's the silver lining.
10072140	10073140	Ooh, yay.
10073140	10077180	Alright, uh, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
10077180	10079020	Loki, you got one more for us?
10079020	10080020	Yes.
10080020	10085740	Uh, you know, as if an ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace weren't annoying enough, they're
10085740	10087380	going to now support Kinect.
10087380	10088380	Awesome.
10088380	10094940	So you spend $150 for the Kinect camera and you get to do wonderful things with your ads,
10094940	10102340	including, um, getting them to retweet bullshit onto your Twitter account.
10102340	10106700	By the way, anybody that retweets bullshit from the Xbox Live Marketplace is going to
10106700	10108620	get unfollowed.
10108620	10110820	Thank you very much.
10110820	10115340	You can say, Xbox, tweet, to let people know that you love coke and not the good kind of
10115340	10118340	coke.
10118340	10122900	Or like, for example, you know, there may be a trailer for, you know, a movie or something,
10122900	10128980	you can go, Xbox, near, and it'll show you, you know, the nearest retailer for whatever
10128980	10137860	or, uh, you know, Xbox schedule for watching a TV show or some bullshit like that.
10137860	10143180	And it just sounds dumb.
10143180	10150500	Uh, one more story for you guys, and guys, this story made Jessica Harper cry.
10150500	10152300	It's making me sad.
10152300	10157180	And go figure, it's going to involve Billy Mitchell in a roundabout way, making Jessica
10157180	10158180	Harper cry.
10158180	10161780	And, of course, Billy Mitchell was in a movie called The King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters.
10161780	10166220	All right, it doesn't have to do directly with Billy Mitchell, but the director of King
10166220	10170780	of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters, uh, who, which was, uh, what's his name?
10170780	10171780	Seth Gordon.
10171780	10172900	He was the director of this movie.
10172900	10176340	He's apparently making a reboot of the movie War Games.
10176340	10177340	Boo!
10177340	10183260	That's right, uh, the 1983 movie starring Matthew Broderick, uh, about hackers.
10183260	10185180	Oh, isn't this a timely story?
10185180	10186740	Global thermonuclear war.
10186740	10189860	Uh, there was even a ColecoVision game in 83.
10189860	10193700	Uh, apparently he wants to reboot the movie War Games.
10193700	10197140	Why does this piss you off, Jessica Harper, as if I need to ask?
10197140	10202620	Um, because I'm getting really freaking tired that nobody can come up with a unique idea
10202620	10203620	anymore.
10203620	10204780	So, hey, let's redo this.
10204780	10205780	Hey, let's redo that.
10205780	10207820	Hey, let's re- oh, wait, oh, Logan's Run.
10207820	10209660	Yeah, that's been in production for how long now?
10209660	10212780	Oh, yeah, let's, uh, redo Pretty in Pink and-
10212780	10213780	Or the trailer.
10213780	10214780	Why?
10214780	10215780	I saw a trailer the other day for Footloose.
10215780	10216780	Yeah.
10216780	10218780	And I was like, what?
10218780	10219780	Yeah, it-
10219780	10220780	Why?
10220780	10225940	Because I completely understand that, you know, I- I- I know that I'm probably towards
10225940	10232100	the end of the Gen X-er group, because, like, I think 77 was about the end.
10232100	10235300	But at the same time, I know we're all getting older.
10235300	10240620	I know that we're all in our late 30s and 40s, but please, please, we don't need to
10240620	10246100	relive the 80s so badly that we have to keep redoing all of these movies that were great
10246100	10247100	to begin with.
10247100	10248100	Stop it!
10248100	10249100	Stop it now!
10249100	10251820	Stop it now!
10251820	10252820	You know what?
10252820	10257500	For a while, if you look at it, though, they were copying a lot of Japanese movies, especially
10257500	10259180	in the horror genre.
10259180	10263020	And then they started rebooting the horror movies, and now they're rebooting, you know-
10263020	10266300	It's because everybody- it's like they don't have any unique ideas anymore.
10266300	10269380	It's too hard for them to come up with something that is different.
10269380	10271980	It's like if you want to get something good and different, you're just gonna have to go
10271980	10272980	to the indie market.
10272980	10276660	Speaking of revivals from the 80s that don't make sense, have you heard of the My Little
10276660	10277660	Bronies phenomenon?
10277660	10278660	Yes.
10278660	10288100	It's apparently- when I was young, My Little Ponies was for girls, and if you liked My
10288100	10292620	Little Ponies and you were a boy, you were an FAG, but apparently now-
10292620	10293620	It's acceptable.
10293620	10299340	It's acceptable, and it's like bros get together and drink beer and watch My Little Pony.
10299340	10304180	Two words, periphery demographic, for the same reason that guys would like Powerpuff
10304180	10305180	Girls.
10305180	10306180	And I'm just like-
10306180	10309260	It's been awesome, but I didn't buy into the whole brony crap.
10309260	10310260	Just like Poker Face.
10310260	10313100	You know what?
10313100	10315900	When you said that, I started thinking of those little homies figures that you get out
10315900	10319260	of the quarter machine mixed with a pony.
10319260	10323100	It's like, you remember Secret of the Magic Crystal with the pink anus and everything?
10323100	10324420	I have that game.
10324420	10328980	Imagine getting really high and or drunk and playing that game with your bros.
10328980	10331420	That's what the My Little Bronies phenomenon is all about.
10331420	10335740	I'm going to love and tolerate the fuck out of you.
10335740	10341740	Plus on top of it now, they've actually completely redone the My Little Pony phenomenon.
10341740	10344220	They've rebooted the entire thing.
10344220	10345460	It went away for a little while.
10345460	10347280	And Strawberry Shortcake.
10347280	10351500	But they came out with all new episodes of My Little Ponies as well.
10351500	10356180	Now it's supposed to be some really amazing, adults can enjoy it too.
10356180	10361020	If you're going to do that, bring back something like Animaniacs, please.
10361020	10362020	I know, right?
10362020	10369100	I bet y'all can't wait for the Smurfs movie that's coming out.
10369100	10370100	Further proves my point.
10370100	10374420	All I have to say, you touch Jem, I will fucking kill you.
10374420	10375620	Oh, it's coming.
10375620	10376620	I'm sure it's coming.
10376620	10377620	I'll kill him.
10377620	10378620	No, no.
10378620	10380340	Except for that guy who does jizz.
10380340	10381340	That's okay.
10381340	10382340	That shit's funny.
10382340	10383340	He already dealt with G.I.
10383340	10384340	Joe.
10384340	10386220	I'm sure He-Man's coming soon too.
10386220	10388360	You know what's actually kind of funny?
10388360	10396020	My wife is terribly excited about the reboot of The Bodyguard with Rihanna.
10396020	10398000	Because the first movie was so great.
10398000	10399460	She loves it.
10399460	10400460	It's a terrible movie.
10400460	10403420	But she loves the movie and she's going to love The Bodyguard because it's a terrible
10403420	10404420	movie.
10404420	10407440	Because Whitney Houston cannot act at all.
10407440	10408440	She is terrible.
10408440	10409440	Period.
10409440	10410440	All right, look.
10410440	10414380	I'm opening up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10414380	10415380	Give us a call.
10415380	10416740	We're going to try and quickly get through calls tonight.
10416740	10418900	So don't be surprised if I'm rushing you along in your call tonight.
10418900	10420500	So I have your question ready.
10420500	10421500	Or comment.

10422500	10424060	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10424060	10426260	The Skype line is open right now.
10426260	10427940	It's going to take about a minute for them to get the message.
10427940	10429740	I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
10429740	10434300	Rob, by the way, said this while we were in the car coming back from Disneyland.
10434300	10435780	The whole...
10435780	10439860	No, when Bobby was talking about...
10439860	10440860	Not Bobby.
10440860	10441860	It was...
10441860	10442860	Peter was talking about hanging out with us.
10442860	10445240	It was like listening to an episode of OLR.
10445240	10447180	Then he broke into the phone line spiel.
10447180	10449300	I was like, that's it.
10449300	10452500	Actually, you do say it exactly the same way every week.
10452500	10453500	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10453500	10456940	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10456940	10457940	Give us a call.
10457940	10458940	We'll talk.
10458940	10459940	No big coffee talk.
10459940	10461940	I'll give you a topic.
10461940	10462940	Barbara.
10462940	10463940	Mormon tabernacle choirs.
10463940	10465940	Neither Mormon nor tabernac...
10465940	10467700	Discuss.
10467700	10469700	Talk amongst yourselves.
10469700	10470860	Well...
10470860	10473940	I'm feeling verklempt.
10473940	10474940	No calls.
10474940	10475940	Let's...
10475940	10476940	It takes a minute.
10476940	10477940	We got like that minute buffer thing going on.
10477940	10478940	What's wrong with you people?
10478940	10480220	They haven't heard the number yet.
10480220	10481220	They don't think the Skypline...
10481220	10485740	And here I complain about our like five second buffer over on USL.
10485740	10489620	They think we're bitching about my little bronies or whatever is still going on.
10489620	10491740	So let's go to the Skypline and see who's there.
10491740	10492740	See, now their calls are coming in.
10492740	10493740	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10493740	10494740	Who's this?
10494740	10495740	What up, guys?
10495740	10496740	It's Xenocore from the OKC.
10496740	10497740	How y'all doing?
10497740	10498740	What is up, Xenocore?
10498740	10500500	Yo, happy birthday, man.
10500500	10501500	Thank you.
10501500	10502500	Welcome to the high council.
10502500	10506380	You get to rule the village now with the rest of us.
10506380	10507380	Awesome.
10507380	10508380	Can't wait.
10508380	10513060	Unfortunately, I only have two cats to rule over.
10513060	10514060	I'm not sure...
10514060	10515060	I didn't get to the beginning of the show.
10515060	10518060	Did you guys give out the news about Star Wars already?
10518060	10520020	No, we didn't.
10520020	10523220	But now that you say it, I'm like, oh yeah, that was some pretty big news.
10523220	10525860	But Xenocore, since you brought it up, I'll let you share.
10525860	10527980	Well, they're turning it off.
10527980	10532100	Galaxies is going away.
10532100	10535180	Does this surprise you, though, with the new one coming out next year?
10535180	10536180	Not at all.
10536180	10538140	They're hurting is what they're doing.
10538140	10543940	It's like sometime after the game, the servers are going offline in December.
10543940	10544940	What you mean?
10544940	10548160	That new player experience didn't revolutionize the game?
10548160	10550180	Don't get me started, Rob.
10550180	10552100	My bad.
10552100	10553100	Don't mess with my...
10553100	10555300	Did you hear that tone suddenly shift?
10555300	10556620	Oh, no, you didn't.
10556620	10561100	It's not so much that, but that's going to extend this show about another hour and a
10561100	10562700	half if you get me on that.
10562700	10567820	He had such powers, because it's so easy to become a Jedi now.
10567820	10571420	But yeah, they're going to turn it off at the end of December, and they're just trying
10571420	10576060	to hurt all the players, so the Old Republic is all they're really trying to do.
10576060	10580540	What can other games learn from Star Wars Galaxies?
10580540	10585340	Don't redesign the entire system without telling your players at a time.
10585340	10586340	Pretty good idea.
10586340	10588620	Yeah, pretty good idea.
10588620	10591180	What do you most hope for when it comes out of the new Star Wars game?
10591180	10592380	I imagine you're going to play it.
10592380	10595380	If you were following the old one, you're probably going to try the new one, right?
10595380	10600620	Yeah, I'm reserving myself until I see it in action, though, because although technically
10600620	10605340	the old game did not have any levels, it was skill-based, you can never avoid grinding
10605340	10610800	in an MMO, because you have to spend time using your skills to get better.
10610800	10612940	So there's going to be a grind somewhere in there.
10612940	10614540	It's almost impossible not to.
10614540	10615540	All right.
10615540	10618940	Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10618940	10622540	Nah, man, just keep up the good work, man.
10622540	10623540	All right.
10623540	10627980	It's a good staple for Sunday to talk people right into Betty by when they're done.
10627980	10631420	Well, we'll pour out a 40 for Star Wars this December.
10631420	10637620	Oh, and one short thing for the whole Bronies thing.
10637620	10642500	That all got started on 4chan, and the series' head is a lurker on 4chan.
10642500	10646340	They actually added a character that's now canonized in My Little Pony.
10646340	10647340	What?
10647340	10649940	Derpy Hooves.
10649940	10653300	There was an editing mistake in the first episode to where one of the ponies was drawn
10653300	10658340	cross-eyed, and so 4chan ran off with it and named her Derpy Hooves.
10658340	10660660	I have to look this up.
10660660	10661740	It's already on Know Your Meme.
10661740	10662980	There's a reference for it already.
10662980	10664780	Oh, oh, this just in?
10664780	10665900	Yes, I've received a news bulletin.
10665900	10666900	And Rocky Boom covered it as well.
10666900	10669860	I'm throwing out my fucking television when I get home.
10669860	10671500	Yes, that news just in.
10671500	10673060	Yeah, and there it is.
10673060	10679940	And on top of that, they wrote up 4chan came up with a backstory that she's a mail carrier.
10679940	10685180	And since the series creator is a lurker on 4chan, she decided to incorporate it.
10685180	10689780	So later on, she included this scene to where she messes up and drops some stuff on one
10689780	10694620	of the main characters' heads, and they do a cut up in the air where all the Pegasus
10694620	10695620	horses are looking at.
10695620	10700620	And you see Derpy Hooves dropping something on top of the other characters.
10700620	10701620	Xenocore?
10701620	10702620	Xenocore?
10702620	10704740	You know way too much about this.
10704740	10707220	I found a picture.
10707220	10709900	And it's on three news shows already.
10709900	10713700	Are you now or have you ever been a brony?
10713700	10716860	I found a picture of Derpy Hooves and put it on in the chat.
10716860	10717860	Oh, hooray.
10717860	10719880	All right, Xenocore, I'm just fucking with you.
10719880	10720880	Have a good one.
10720880	10721880	Thanks for the call.
10721880	10722880	Y'all have a good show.
10722880	10723880	Later.
10723880	10725140	I am saving this.
10725140	10728860	How do I feel about 4chan controlling what's on my television?
10728860	10731020	I feel a little violated, actually.
10731020	10733580	I love the name, though.
10733580	10734580	Derp.
10734580	10735580	Derp derp.

10742060	10743060	Give us a call.
10743060	10744060	We'll talk.
10744060	10749940	Oh, do we have last minute stories, Loki?
10749940	10751380	Oh, he's shaking his head.
10751380	10752380	Nope.
10752380	10753380	Not even trying.
10753380	10754380	I don't care tonight.
10754380	10757060	There's no way anyone can follow up Derpy Hooves.
10757060	10760420	They'll try.
10760420	10765900	So what do you hope happens in the next nine years of OrangeLoungeRadio, DarkSakura?
10765900	10767540	We start getting paid.
10767540	10770180	Good luck with that one.
10770180	10771620	That would be nice.
10771620	10775940	Remember when we were gonna, uh, remember when people were saying we should be on G4
10775940	10776940	TV?
10776940	10780940	Hey, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10780940	10781940	Who's this?
10781940	10784700	Hey, it's the one and only DJ Ron Maness from Anime GM Session.
10784700	10785700	How are you guys doing tonight?
10785700	10786900	I am fantastic.
10786900	10787900	I'm super.
10787900	10788900	Thanks for asking.
10788900	10789900	How are you?
10789900	10794660	I am good, and Rob, happy birthday, you fabulous, awesome guy, you.
10794660	10797020	Thank you very much, nice man.
10797020	10798020	Fabulous!
10798020	10799020	Fabulous!
10799020	10801620	What is up?
10801620	10804820	What's on your mind?
10804820	10809140	Before I get into that, I just wanted to say tonight's show is just pretty damn awesome.
10809140	10810260	Well, thank you.
10810260	10813420	Because no one's been drinking yet, and it's just been just awesome.
10813420	10815100	No one's been drinking yet.
10815100	10816100	We're high on life.
10816100	10817100	Oh, really?
10817100	10818620	I'm too old to drink now.
10818620	10820380	My bladder can't handle it.
10820380	10821380	Bullshit.
10821380	10824500	Y'all are probably high on pixie sticks or something.
10824500	10827300	God, here comes Dan, all right?
10827300	10828300	Ah, shit.
10828300	10829780	So what's on your mind tonight, Rama?
10829780	10830900	What are you doing?
10830900	10838260	I have in front of me a bottle of Captain Morgan and a double shot.
10838260	10844860	A toast to OrangeLoungeRadio, its hosts, the fanbase, and a nine-year anniversary.
10844860	10848220	Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.
10848220	10852220	If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
10852220	10853220	Amen, brother!
10853220	10858660	Well, I'm gonna feel that in the morning.
10858660	10861300	I'll drink to that, bub.
10861300	10862300	Mm-hmm.
10862300	10863300	Awesome.
10863300	10864300	So.
10864300	10865300	Yes.
10865300	10869860	Anything else you want to share with us tonight after that lovely toast?
10869860	10870860	Maybe.
10870860	10871860	What?
10871860	10873420	If we should announce it live on air.
10873420	10875140	Okay, I'm a little afraid.
10875140	10878180	What are we gonna announce live on air?
10878180	10881700	Something that we discussed on Twitter Friday night.
10881700	10883820	What's that, Rama?
10883820	10887580	Our little engagement.
10887580	10888580	That's right.
10888580	10893220	Since gay marriage passed in New York, which of course is a wonderful thing, you know,
10893220	10895220	it's great, you know, hooray for equality.
10895220	10897140	How are you and Rama getting married?
10897140	10901140	Yeah, the first thing I did, I went to Twitter and I said, where's my marriage proposal,
10901140	10902140	Rama?
10902140	10903860	I knew it!
10903860	10907740	Well, Rama, I'm not saying yes till I get a ring on it.
10907740	10912380	It's, well, you'll get the ring faster than Salacious Pop will pop it on there, I guess.
10912380	10913380	I don't know.
10913380	10920100	No, I mean, Salacious Pop knows that he's the one for me, but you know, now and then,
10920100	10922140	I like a little dark chocolate.
10922140	10930100	Well, you know what they say, once you go black, you don't go black.
10930100	10936380	You missed Dan in the other room, going, oh my god!
10936380	10939740	Dan mad bro?
10939740	10941740	You mad bro?
10941740	10949820	Alright, well, Rama, until our honeymoon, I gotta say goodnight for now.
10949820	10951580	That's quite alright, man.
10951580	10954940	Just so you know, my girlfriend doesn't mind, because she plays on both sides.
10954940	10955940	I know, it's hot.
10955940	10956940	Alright.
10956940	10957940	Hell yeah!
10957940	10958940	Later.
10958940	10959940	Later.
10959940	10960940	Later.
10960940	10961940	Later.
10961940	10962940	Alright.
10962940	10963940	1877 Game OLR.
10963940	10964940	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10964940	10967940	Give us a call, we'll talk.
10967940	10970140	Are you sure?
10970140	10974220	Maybe I'll get more marriage proposals tonight, who knows, we'll see what'll happen.
10974220	10978220	Now you need, you know, SSJ100Matt to call you, you know, another, there you go, another
10978220	10979220	New York.
10979220	10981460	I know what you're looking at me for, Rob, swear to god.
10981460	10985020	Salacious Pop's in chat, and he's just commented on the situation.
10985020	10989180	He said the following, someone's about to wake up in the Hudson River, to be honest.
10989180	10995980	I'm not sure if that was for me or Rama, I guess we'll find out.
10995980	11000220	Bones006 says once you go bulk, you will never go back.
11000220	11002220	Nice typo there.
11002220	11003220	Alright.
11003220	11009100	We've got time for one or two more calls.
11009100	11012900	Rama said to Salacious Pop, oh baby heart.
11012900	11013900	Oh.
11013900	11016900	Snap snap, there's a call coming.
11016900	11017900	Snap snap.
11017900	11018900	Snap snap.
11018900	11020860	Rama Renaissance Radio, who's this?
11020860	11022940	Um, Nathan Legend.
11022940	11023940	What is up?
11023940	11030580	Well, I wanted to talk about Smurfs and 3D.
11030580	11033340	First question in response, how high are you?
11033340	11034860	La la la la la la.
11034860	11039660	Alright, let's talk about this all at once, the Smurfs and 3D, all at once.
11039660	11045780	Okay, so I think this is going to be the best movie of 2000 plus.
11045780	11047340	How high do you have to be to think that?
11047340	11049420	No, no, let's hear the man out.
11049420	11051060	Every gamer gets a voice.
11051060	11052580	Except you.
11052580	11057940	Okay, so first of all, I use Smurfs in my daily language.
11057940	11063060	So in order to complete my vocabulary, I say Smurf, I say, um, what Smurf is it?
11063060	11064140	Like what time is it?
11064140	11068860	So you know, I believe this movie will help us.
11068860	11071660	You know what, you're getting Sonic Screwdriver.
11071660	11074860	How does this game rate on a scale of one to five Smurfs?
11074860	11075860	Exterminate!
11075860	11081660	Is this game like a jokey Smurf or is it like Smurfette?
11081660	11085740	Is this game a jokey Smurf or is it the one game in the village everybody else is going
11085740	11086740	to bang?
11086740	11087740	Smurfette.
11087740	11090260	Now Smurfette's got younger competition, remember?
11090260	11093980	I just want to say jokey Smurf, for legal reasons.
11093980	11100100	So you really think that the Smurfs is going to be the greatest cultural phenomenon of
11100100	11101100	our time.
11101100	11103820	They're going to refer to this generation as the Smurf generation.
11103820	11108500	Yes, it's going to change the economy and everything.
11108500	11110020	Until the advent of derpy Smurf.
11110020	11113060	We'll have to pay him Smurf Berries.
11113060	11117060	And it's all because Obama's president, according to the BBC, apparently.
11117060	11121820	Yes, we can't come up with Smurfs, yes we can.
11121820	11125060	Yes we can, Smurfs, 2012.
11125060	11126780	Papa Smurf for president.
11126780	11129900	You can be a little old.
11129900	11132460	And that means not from America.
11132460	11135220	I'm from America, USA, USA.
11135220	11141580	Now, you know, the sad thing is I probably would vote for Papa Smurf before you catch
11141580	11145540	me voting for Michelle Bachman, but I'm not going to get political on this program.
11145540	11146940	All right.
11146940	11147940	Anyhow.
11147940	11148940	Congratulations.
11148940	11149940	All right.
11149940	11150940	Thank you so much.
11150940	11153980	And keep up the good Smurf.
11153980	11159500	I have a response to that whole thing.
11159500	11161480	You know what?
11161480	11165980	One thing I will never regret about nine years of Orange Lounge Radio is phone calls like
11165980	11169800	that.
11169800	11175540	Things that just make you say, what the fuck, guys?
11175540	11176540	You know what?
11176540	11181340	Hey, the only downfall is that we don't have our Swede around.
11181340	11186460	Because he had a call from the Swede.
11186460	11187720	Is he not here tonight?
11187720	11189340	I don't know that he's here.
11189340	11190340	Oh, bummer.
11190340	11193620	And he already told us he's not going to be in attendance at the 10th.
11193620	11194620	Why?
11194620	11196780	Because he has some festival he has to be at.
11196780	11197780	I'm like, Dernit.
11197780	11198780	Festival?
11198780	11201460	We have to have a Swedish call.
11201460	11203260	Well, then fine.
11203260	11204260	I'm going to have to call.
11204260	11205260	I'll run outside.
11205260	11206500	I'll say, hey, be right back, guys.
11206500	11207500	I got to use the bathroom.
11207500	11208500	I got to take a big dump.
11208500	11210180	And then I'll go outside and I'll call my cell phone.
11210180	11212860	Which is funny because the bathroom's like across the hall from the studio.
11212860	11214420	Oh, this is the Swedish chef.
11214420	11215420	Herbie derbie derbie der.
11215420	11217060	And I'll just be the Swedish chef calling in.
11217060	11218500	And it'll be incredibly racist.
11218500	11221140	We could call the IKEA customer service line.
11221140	11222140	Rob.
11222140	11224940	I'll just play ABBA.
11224940	11227420	Let's just settle on Mr. Bucket for president.
11227420	11230140	Do not bring that to the show.
11230140	11231140	Mr. Bucket.
11231140	11233980	God, that thing is so funny.
11233980	11240620	Did you watch the Angry Video Game Nerd when they were being haunted by Mr. Bucket?
11240620	11241620	Do I want to know?
11241620	11242620	No.
11242620	11243620	I love the Angry Video Game Nerd.
11243620	11244620	This was great.
11244620	11245960	All right.
11245960	11247500	Let's go to one more call here.
11247500	11248500	Let's see what happens.
11248500	11249500	Hi.
11249500	11250500	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11250500	11251500	Who's this?
11251500	11252500	That's Legend of Zaku.
11252500	11253500	What is up, Zaku?
11253500	11254500	Nothing much.
11254500	11257460	Just getting ready for tomorrow for work.
11257460	11263460	And just congratulating you on like what, nine years now that you've been on the air?
11263460	11264460	Yeah.
11264460	11265460	It's been about nine.
11265460	11268260	So Zaku, you've been here for almost nine of those years.
11268260	11269380	You've been here for quite a bit of it.
11269380	11270380	I know that much.
11270380	11271380	Yeah.
11271380	11272380	I think I was here for seven of those.
11272380	11274100	What do you think?
11274100	11277100	There's an important question asked on Twitter a while ago.
11277100	11284640	What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years of, what is the most impactful
11284640	11288680	thing that's happened in nine years of Orange, not just Orange Lounge Radio, but in nine
11288680	11290220	years of video gaming?
11290220	11292060	Oh, wow.
11292060	11293060	Damn.
11293060	11297380	That's a, well, I guess I could give you the benefit of both.
11297380	11303120	Like for Orange Lounge Radio, you breaking away from Live 365, changing up the format.
11303120	11305100	It's kind of like graduating.
11305100	11308740	You start off with Imani, but now you're just encompassing video games in general.
11308740	11309740	Yeah.
11309740	11310740	We're out of pull-ups now.
11310740	11311740	Right.
11311740	11312740	Exactly.
11312740	11314740	I'm a big kid now.
11314740	11315740	Wow.
11315740	11316740	Video gaming.
11316740	11317900	Oh, wow.
11317900	11325380	Just the fact that, you know, we've evolved from just from playing with controllers and,
11325380	11330020	and you know, and through traditional channels like, you know, through the arcades, but just
11330020	11333340	evolving to like not needing the controller at all.
11333340	11337340	Meaning you're the controller, you know, you being the controller essentially with the
11337340	11338340	Wii.
11338340	11342980	Well, I know the Wii is kind of like you do need the controller, but you're using, you're
11342980	11349140	using your extremities to actually, you know, to register input.
11349140	11352220	I got one extremity I still can't use to play a game.
11352220	11355460	Oh, I'm sure there's ways, sir.
11355460	11358460	I am sure of it.
11358460	11359460	You're just not thinking at all.
11359460	11362580	First thing I'm doing when I get my copy of Child of Eden is I'm going to try playing
11362580	11364700	with my dong.
11364700	11371260	In nine years I've, in nine years I've seen basically, you know, Microsoft take like that
11371260	11376860	little platform that could and just go far with, I have to admit, they didn't, they did
11376860	11379740	10 times as better as the Atari Jaguar.
11379740	11383020	Just be thankful listening audience that they don't have a cam right now.
11383020	11389140	Sorry, I was doing my Child of Eden with my dong while you were talking, I'm sorry.
11389140	11390780	Yeah, I mean, that's-
11390780	11392660	Isn't that illegal in some states?
11392660	11393660	Probably.
11393660	11396300	So Rob, that won't work because you don't have a glove at the end to make it look like
11396300	11398740	a hand because it still thinks it's a penis.
11398740	11399740	Oh shit.
11399740	11400740	All right.
11400740	11406500	But yeah, it's like that, that whole evolution, like gaming, it's like, it's, it's going beyond
11406500	11411620	what I, what I grew up with before then was just like, you know, going to a friend's place
11411620	11417580	to play like Genesis and Super Nintendo games or the PlayStation, but it's like something
11417580	11424420	that you could sit down, you could go online through Xbox or PS3 and just like, you know,
11424420	11426900	get yelled at by, by 10 year old kids.
11426900	11430780	You know, we've come a long way from the old school Atari 2600 controller, which if you
11430780	11432940	think about it now was kind of phallic.
11432940	11435180	I mean, yeah, it's, it's very archaic.
11435180	11442700	It's like so primitive that it was just like, it was just a four way stick and a button.
11442700	11443700	That's all it was.
11443700	11446220	I'm saying a giant phallus basically.
11446220	11453500	All the way down to like at least eight or, you know, at least eight to 10 actual controls
11453500	11455900	on it, on a controller.
11455900	11461180	And with the fact that you could actually like use your, use your body to, you know,
11461180	11462180	to control things.
11462180	11467140	I mean, the next step will probably be PS9 when they, when they insert, when they actually
11467140	11470580	feed all that data into your, straight and straight into your head.
11470580	11471580	It's the holodeck.
11471580	11474860	I'm saying every generation of gaming is one step closer to the holodeck.
11474860	11475860	Yeah, we're close.
11475860	11481460	What we need is a VR headset, and we need headsets in which I can basically play back
11481460	11487180	memories and other stuff, or just have that pipes, you know, directly into my brain.
11487180	11488180	And that's it.
11488180	11493260	I just literally sit there, close my eyes and that, and I've basically become, you know,
11493260	11494400	that deeper into the game.
11494400	11497900	You are the machine and then you're a Borg.
11497900	11500620	I think you got Rob excited about pipes and deeper.
11500620	11502420	I'm still thinking about my dong.
11502420	11507500	Anyhow, all right, Zach, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but take care
11507500	11508500	buddy.
11508500	11509500	All right.
11509500	11510500	Have a good one.
11510500	11511500	Bye.
11511500	11512500	1-877-GAMO-L-R-U-C-N-A-M-S-S-K-I-F-O-R-I-S-H-O-N-I-T-O.
11512500	11515700	I guess we can do one more call.
11515700	11516700	Sweet.
11516700	11521700	I guess we could do one more call, whoever might call us on our nine year anniversary
11521700	11522700	show.
11522700	11523700	See what happens.
11523700	11530100	Um, yeah, we're running a little long tonight, but whatever it's a birthday show.
11530100	11531100	We can do that.
11531100	11536380	Why are you complaining about something running a little long?
11536380	11540700	I-D-K. Are you still reading about that derpy horse?
11540700	11547120	I was trying, cause he said it had been, it was like a fan character that was, my intention
11547120	11551380	on bringing up the My Little Brony thing was not to get you all addicted.
11551380	11553660	That's actually not what I meant.
11553660	11555980	Those are not, those are not baked goods.
11555980	11563780	I am just reading the My Little Brony Friendship is Magic Wiki.
11563780	11565980	Hey we have an Orange Launch Radio Wiki, did you know that?
11565980	11566980	It's been updated.
11566980	11569100	And if we can get a wiki, they can get it.
11569100	11570660	I look at it weekly.
11570660	11571660	Do you?
11571660	11573560	Yes, when I have to pick the classic game.
11573560	11576460	Let's go to another call, maybe this will be the last one.
11576460	11594220	Why am I giving out the number again, if this is the last call?
11594220	11599140	Jessica Harper has summoned the Swede, and just like that a wild Swede approaches.
11599140	11601420	Quick, throw a pester ball.
11601420	11607940	Queen, Queen, feel the beat.
11607940	11610060	Oh well, what the hell.
11610060	11615340	He started saying, no, but he started saying, no, it's like, yeah, Swedish music festivals
11615340	11621100	are like, Efex Twin is fucking playing in Arvika!
11621100	11623100	The fuck did he just say?
11623100	11630180	Efex Twin, Richard D.J. is playing in Arvika, and I'm gonna see it.
11630180	11636140	Oh, the Swedish Music Festival is the same weekend as the 10th anniversary of OLR.
11636140	11637140	That's the whole thing.
11637140	11639380	Yeah, fuck me, in other words.
11639380	11645980	If we can't get the Swede on USL for our anniversary, then of course I'm gonna have to subject you
11645980	11653540	to the Swede on your anniversary, so thank you very much, Akki Ripper.
11653540	11657140	You heard it here first, 10th anniversary from the Swedish Music Festival.
11657140	11664260	Here's the thing, if the Swede can't make it to 10 years of USL, then 20 years of USL
11664260	11665260	will be in Sweden.
11665260	11666260	Oh, okay, yeah.
11666260	11667260	There we go.
11667260	11668260	There you go.
11668260	11673380	So we'll be the ones up at five something in the morning, because we have to maintain
11673380	11674380	the time zone.
11674380	11681740	No, it will actually be in Sweden so that Travis can start off the show by saying, Sweden,
11681740	11686580	I am inside you.
11686580	11696820	And that excites the owls far too much, obviously.
11696820	11700580	To question from our chat room, Tiger Claw wants to know, is the Swedish Music Festival
11700580	11701580	a rave?
11701580	11709380	No, it's not, but it's like Arvika Festival is kinda in a way, yes.
11709380	11715940	Let me ask you this, how many people will you make out with at the festival?
11715940	11719100	If I know myself, none.
11719100	11720740	Then it's not a rave.
11720740	11726900	Well, the unfunny part is that, well, I'm like one of those, I don't know, because here's
11726900	11734540	the unfunny part is that the thing is that I haven't went to a so-called classical Swedish
11734540	11741980	Music Festival in like six or five years.
11741980	11745880	So I don't know, I might be out of touch of sorts.
11745880	11749580	See I think I can get closer and that's the only reason I stick with Pot-a-Pot-a-Paradise,
11749580	11751460	drop E and hump the coin return.
11751460	11760900	Okay, well, I have, but no, I'm way uncertain as far as I'm going to make out with anyone.
11760900	11766100	And plus, by the way, but bonus point if I can find any CPI.
11766100	11771340	Okay, Ripper, I'm going to let you have the last say here tonight on the Skype line and
11771340	11775540	I want to know the question I've asked a few other callers that we got through Twitter.
11775540	11779460	What's been the most impactful thing in the past nine years in gaming?
11779460	11794020	Do you think that's, uh, I, I have no, I, the only thing that I can take up top of my
11794020	11798260	head is like the Wii controller.
11798260	11800260	What the hell?
11800260	11802780	No, no, I, I'm sorry.
11802780	11809500	I apologize to the rest of the listeners at this point, but Travis and I have to know.
11809500	11812020	Have you shoved a Wii controller up your butt today?
11812020	11814860	No, I have not, unfortunately.
11814860	11818660	I have shoved other things up my butts as well.
11818660	11821880	Thank you, sir.
11821880	11822880	And he doesn't disappoint.
11822880	11824660	And we'll end on that note.
11824660	11826380	Thank you, Aki Ripper.
11826380	11828020	Have fun at the Swedish Music Festival.
11828020	11840820	Later, I can think no of no better way to cap off nine years of orange launch radio
11840820	11841820	than that.
11841820	11843220	Now we have 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.
11843220	11845220	So bye everybody.
11845220	11851140	I haven't shoved a Wii controller up my ass today, but I shoved something else up my ass.
11851140	11854140	La la la la la la la la.
11854140	11856340	Hey, Mr. DJ.
11856340	11858300	Rob just turned red.
11858300	11862180	You're welcome.
11862180	11863580	You're so very, very welcome.
11863580	11867780	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as if I need to ask tonight.
11867780	11871780	Uh, Loki, thank you for being here, as you always are.
11871780	11872820	No problem.
11872820	11875060	And let's make it to year 10.
11875060	11876380	What's your final thought tonight?
11876380	11880620	My final thought tonight is Earth Defense Wars, Earth Insect Armageddon next week.
11880620	11883060	I cannot wait to play it.
11883060	11884060	Screw everything else.
11884060	11888220	I don't give a crap about your fucking Black Eyed Peas experience.
11888220	11891820	It's all about blowing up insects, large insects.
11891820	11894180	Let me go to the guests tonight and get their final thoughts as well.
11894180	11897340	Drew Nami, first off, our ever present intern.
11897340	11898940	Good luck with everything going on in your personal life.
11898940	11901740	I know you got a lot of change coming on the horizon, but we appreciate you stopping by
11901740	11904820	to tip your hat at our little program, our dog and pony show.
11904820	11905820	I'll be back.
11905820	11906820	Uh, all right.
11906820	11908700	Uh, your final thoughts tonight?
11908700	11912940	Wii controller, what the hell?
11912940	11917780	Jessica Harper, I don't know what to say to you right now.
11917780	11920620	I think I'm going to thank you for being here tonight.
11920620	11925620	I might take that back tomorrow once the ratings come in for the show.
11925620	11930180	In all seriousness, best of luck on your audition, knock them dead.
11930180	11931180	And let's karaoke sometime.
11931180	11932180	That would be fun.
11932180	11933180	Yeah, totally.
11933180	11934900	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11934900	11939660	I'm just going to do my final thought as a nice big butt plug.
11939660	11946740	And please guys, go ahead and go to understationlive.org and download some podcasts.
11946740	11947740	Check us out.
11947740	11952760	If you like us, we're on Saturdays for two hours, 8 PM Pacific, 11 on the East coast.
11952760	11955260	And they let Aki Ripper go for like 20 minutes sometimes.
11955260	11959980	So Travis has the common decency to hang up on people too.
11959980	11962140	All right.
11962140	11964980	And let's see, I'll let, I'll let dark soccer go last.
11964980	11966400	So I'll give my final thought.
11966400	11971720	My final thought is, um, thank you everybody.
11971720	11972720	That's my final thought.
11972720	11973720	Thank you.
11973720	11974720	Dark soccer.
11974720	11975720	Your final thought.
11975720	11981380	I live in a giant bucket.
11981380	11983640	My spoon is too big.
11983640	11986040	From all of us here at orange launch radio.
11986040	11990900	Thank you for putting up with us for the past nine years.
11990900	11993060	We do it for you.
11993060	11998300	I'm not sure why you keep letting us do it to you, but thank you for being willing.
11998300	12008840	If you've enjoyed the show, tell a friend about the show and maybe we'll see you next
12008840	12010020	week.
12010020	12011140	If we don't get canceled.
12011140	12012140	Have a good night.
