93475	94856	We have special guests joining us tonight.
94976	96878	Of course, as always, you guys in chat.
96938	101962	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com You join us live and we read your comments here.
102563	103904	It is a show where every gamer has a voice.
103964	108067	We will have the phone lines open later despite that little tease I gave on Bobby's show beforehand.
108107	109308	We will have the phone lines open later.
109608	110309	And of course, Twitter.
110349	111190	Twitter.com slash OLR.
111770	114291	Email bag, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Did I get it all?
114311	115292	Someone didn't put it on the show roll.
116012	116332	Whatever.
116832	117373	It's not there?
117733	117933	No.
118333	119874	Oh, well we are doing the mailbag at some point.
120654	120874	Damn.
120894	122675	When is a mystery to everybody?
123735	126757	Anyhow, let's introduce the guests we have here in studio.
126997	130658	We have some blasts from the past here to celebrate nine years of OLR with us.
131439	139802	As mentioned on Bobby's show, when you have your 100th episode, your 200th episode, your five year episode, you kind of run out of like...
141583	148747	The ego stroking gets a little old, but we thought what better way to mark nine years of OLR than to invite somebody who's on a show that's even older.
149167	152489	So say hello to the one and only Jessica Harper is here tonight.
152509	156371	I thought you were going to say, you know, when you're talking about ego stroking, who better than Jessica Harper?
159049	160210	Is that another word for it?
161691	162831	Euphemism.
162991	163912	I'm doing just fine.
163992	164372	Welcome.
164432	169735	And of course, you know, some of the dinner people from back in the day of Maundy Days know you as Iguana Girl.
169775	169975	Yes.
170235	173257	The Queen Bee of DDR Freak for quite some time.
173297	174197	Exactly, yeah.
174518	175158	The Queen Bitch.
176018	181879	We got all the DDR Freak gossip a few months ago when you were on the show last, so I don't know how much of that we want to revisit.
182099	183359	We'll see how much wine we get in you.
184060	185320	Yeah, I know.
186000	187400	But I have to make sure I don't have too much.
187940	193141	But of course you're here tonight to help plug the Under Sedation Live 10-year anniversary show is coming up.
193261	195442	Yes, coming up on July 16th.
195982	197422	We will have 10 years.
198182	199982	And we'll be sealing Rob away for that night.
200682	203563	He'll have the fun of doing two shows in one week.
203848	208711	Because as you guys may or may not know, I was doing Understation Live back when it first started.
208931	210552	Back then, it was before OLR.
210953	214335	OLR was a spinoff of Understation Live in some ways.
214875	221420	In some ways, just like DDR Freak Radio, which again, another blast from the past right there, was a spinoff of Understation Live.
221440	224902	So we all kind of formed our own stations based off of that station.
224922	230346	We all hatched out of that egg, and somehow we all came out looking like Lady Gaga, our respective shows.
230646	233368	I came out looking more like Weird Al, but I don't know.
234908	236369	Complete with the CGI'd face.
236449	237049	Exactly.
237249	237949	Very odd.
238089	238389	All right.
239069	239449	Anyhow.
239569	244730	As long as you make sure I'm wearing an octopus and have, you know, a big, huge building on my head, I'm all good.
244770	246991	Are you going for the Ursula look with the octopus?
247611	247951	Exactly.
247971	248451	In the building.
248491	249991	You know, I have to have the large building.
250151	251932	Which, by the way, can I just, random tangent.
252632	253472	I was at Disneyland.
253512	256973	I had to go without Alan because, you know, it was just finances being what they were.
257253	259013	But there's two things that Alan loves.
259173	261074	He loves Hello Kitty and he loves Ursula.
261394	262994	And you know what I was able to find at Build-A-Bear?
263454	264215	Hello Kitty Ursula.
264395	266436	A Hello Kitty, and I put an Ursula costume on it.
266456	266956	There you go.
268698	269878	And it's the best thing ever.
270079	270799	Yeah, I'm sure.
270979	271339	I'm sure.
272300	272920	That was awesome.
273401	273641	All right.
273941	274562	We will talk video games.
274582	276123	Oh, and her name is Divine.
276143	276883	Yeah, her name is Divine.
277604	277844	Anyhow.
278104	278744	It's more appropriate.
278904	282527	We will talk video games in a moment, but I have to introduce another blast from the past.
282567	291793	And this is somebody who wasn't on Under Sedation Live, but he was on many, many, many early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, and then he disappeared.
292173	292954	But now he's back.
293934	297535	Say hello everybody to the one and only intern Drew is back tonight.
297575	298075	Hey, what's up?
298115	307497	You can't keep me away from this place for long and still having a little bit of wine right now and it's going to affect me far more than it will Jessica.
307537	312878	This is creeping me out because back when the 23rd Magus was on the show back in the day, you weren't old enough to drink.
313118	313358	I was 17.
313658	315098	Oh my god.
315118	316439	I'm so old.
316559	317779	And now I feel old.
318879	320420	I've been here for nine years.
320580	322901	You can shut up with all that right about now.
322941	324642	He was also our resident young Republican.
325603	328545	From the two females in the room, can we both say, shut up.
329425	331566	Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.
331926	342192	And now I'm, this is reminding me of my first show because once again, it's actually, it's Loki that has the pizza this time and I'm the closest to the floor.
343453	345394	So yeah, feeling old and moldy right now.
346138	349220	This reminds me of the first show, too, because I had a migraine that day.
371055	390923	Breakman starts us off saying he left and comes back and is still an intern lol absolutely because as long as he's an intern we don't have to pay him SSJ100 Matt says oh god hide your soundboard tables that is one of the highlights I guess you could say of OLR history was the night the 23rd Magus I'm gonna call him that all night long because it's retro
391423	393365	Drew broke the show
411870	412771	E. Gads, The Table Hath Fallen
437586	446996	So this week on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, our website, Dark Tetsuya, who, bless his heart, he's like the only person that's actually writing content for the site right now.
447216	450700	And I'm thinking I need to make a New Year's resolution.
450760	452482	I'm saying New Year of OLR's resolution.
452542	457948	Actually write content for the website because we need to get more people visiting OrangeLaunchRadio.com and posting on our forums and stuff.
458248	459610	And I think a lot of that comes with content.
460210	460770	Dark Tetsuya
485160	491584	So, again, a lot of people didn't really follow the scene in those days, but it was kind of fun to read about what's happened to a lot of those people.
492085	494486	Of course, you can't mention Bomani Culture without Get It.
495407	495867	Stop it.
496307	503592	But one of the people that was interviewed was Jessica, and you can read her article up on there and see what she's been up to, or she'll just tell us about it tonight.
505199	507580	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
532515	536276	Just slowly morph into gambling machines for children that spit out tickets.
536517	536717	Yeah.
536757	537357	And nothing else.
537497	537677	Yeah.
537917	541979	And what did you feel walking into Roseville Golf Land and just kind of seeing it now?
542239	542959	I wanted to cry.
543659	543979	Did you?
544079	544680	I really did.
544860	545820	It was just pathetic.
546640	554323	You walk in, and previously, one of the only reasons why I would still even go there was because there was a 2DX machine for a period of time there.
554804	555184	It's gone.
555504	555644	Mm-hmm.
556404	559907	Um, the, there's still two DDR machines.
559947	567532	They're now in a back corner tucked away where people like to walk over the pads even more so than they did when they were prominently displayed towards the middle.
567752	570174	And keep in mind, Roseville Golf Land is also a water park.
570314	574797	So a lot of times during the summer, that will be wet feet walking over electronic machines.
574957	576238	Genius people out in Roseville.
576358	580121	Or playing on the machines with their wet feet and leaving all of their water behind.
580341	580561	Mm-hmm.
581122	581202	Um,
582682	586284	The only machines that are there, you have an Extreme machine.
587325	589006	I'm sorry, Max 2.
589967	591428	And Disney's Rave.
592188	593189	And that's it for DDR.
593910	598173	And Drum Mania, there's no drumsticks.
598213	601495	There's a stool that's attached.
601515	605778	There's a stool that's attached by a big, huge metal chain so that you can't move it.
606999	611782	And the Guitar Freaks controllers were upside down and on the floor when I looked at it.
612242	613543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
632282	632582	What?
633103	634484	I took a picture of it.
634504	636326	Hold on, let me find my picture of it because I took a picture.
636346	637967	It's a Tetris game that's a giant ball.
638208	642572	Each controller is a huge ball and the screen is like twice my height.
643191	648595	Yeah, and there's a button on each side of the ball, and to move things, you have to move the ball around with your hands.
648715	649916	It's awkward Tetris.
650697	651557	Awkward Tetris.
651577	653599	That's exactly, well, it really is awkward.
653639	654319	It's hard to play, too.
654339	655340	Awkward phallic Tetris.
655700	656041	No.
656221	661445	With about half the size of the normal amount of lines, or actually a third of the amount of lines that you would normally have.
661465	665428	And it's still kind of hard to get any at all, because it's like, oh, you want it here?
665468	666528	Well, we're going to move you one block over.
667909	669250	Because it does not center.
669791	669911	Yeah.
670736	673040	Some comments in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com.
673060	673380	Let's see.
674042	676526	SSJ100Matt says, Every Golf Land is like that, though.
676847	678710	Yeah, but every Golf Land is not in Roseville.
678911	682778	And Roseville is a special place because everyone there is privileged.
684404	694974	Keep in mind that all of these horrible things that are happening to the arcade are complete opposite as to what's happening to every other portion of the Golfland Sunsplash experience.
695575	702061	You have Sunsplash, which just keeps on growing, and they keep getting more rides, and now there's this giant...
704382	716608	I do appreciate the fact that they have more parking because it was annoying having to park in and out in order to make it to Sunsplash.
716628	717328	You had to hike in.
717368	718729	During summertime, yeah.
719009	720250	The rest of the year was no problem.
720490	720810	Here it is.
722110	724352	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
740948	746131	Also in our chat room, chat.orange.com, TheRobD says, Skee-Ball is also Bring Your Own Skee-Balls.
746691	748632	Actually, I did play around a Skee-Ball last time.
748672	749573	I was at Arviggle.
750013	759058	And you know how, like, a bunch of balls are supposed to come down like nine balls, but if the machine is short any... It'll only give, like, three balls, and then it'll keep refilling the same balls.
759078	759438	I had two.
759958	760479	Yeah.
760499	765321	So I had to literally wait after I would throw two balls for... Now, see, I did play Skee-Ball while I was there.
765381	765661	Okay.
766482	767963	The one on the very far left...
768883	769844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
791716	793517	Orange Lounge Radio giving you the pro tips.
793677	794237	Exactly.
796178	804663	And the whole reason why I ended up resorting to the little kiddie gambling games is because I had this card that had something to the tune of about 100 credits on it.
805143	805524	Oh, that's right.
805544	806464	They went through the card system.
806604	808525	That's how long it's been since I've gone there.
808965	810386	I think I have tokens still.
810406	812587	Yeah, I think at one point in time I tossed a $20 bill on...
814108	815949	to get a card so that I could play 2DX.
816009	818169	And I played for like an hour that one day.
818949	822210	And went, oh, I'll just go ahead and save this card and bring it back for next time.
822370	824091	And this was the next time.
824351	828932	Speaking of which, Rob, do you remember I was going to Dave & Buster's like the first year we went to E3?
829232	830953	I'm still using that damn card!
832373	833673	Like, I don't go there ever.
833693	837254	You need to go for the two-for-one arcade night or whatever it's called.
838855	839215	Yes, 23 Magus.
841055	842797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
861877	862037	Aw.
862858	869120	So, before we get into our gaming weeks, which is how we're usually supposed to start off the show, but, you know, it's a birthday show, just deal.
869780	879724	I want to talk, because we were talking about turf and how the Rosewood Golf needs to be our turf, but I got to tell you one of my favorite just memories of the past nine years when it comes to when arcades are actually fun.
879864	885666	And that would be, as ghetto fuck as it is, Scandia Family Fun Entertainment Center.
885686	886767	Because I'm just going to say it.
887347	889629	We own that fucking joint for a short period of time.
889790	891291	Oh yeah, we did.
891591	892933	That was our turf.
893513	898018	The whole reason is when you get friendly, when you befriend the game tech.
898138	898358	Yes.
899127	900068	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
923706	924427	I don't even remember.
924447	925487	We did March Madness.
925647	926948	Okay, I want to see the other one.
926968	928669	Which is normally a Bay Area tournament.
928849	937155	I'm telling you, we monopolized the birthday party room with our room where we were deep frying Twinkies and selling them.
937395	937755	Why?
938276	938656	Because we could.
938676	940838	I don't know, because it sounded funny.
941698	944540	because Justin B thought it would be a good idea.
944560	945940	What the hell ever happened to that kid?
946021	946681	I don't know.
946701	947261	He does music.
947301	948182	I think he remixes music now.
948202	949743	He's remixing stuff still.
950303	951844	We need to get him to do a thing.
952284	953825	One of his songs won Cage Match once.
953845	957647	And don't forget that for Shaft, the pad broke.
958347	959268	I do remember that.
959748	964571	And I had to run back home and go get my hard-mounted soft pads.
965071	967052	If that tells you how old school this is, kids.
967292	969294	There was no such thing as a Colabot Flex back then.
970293	978805	Hard, yeah, it was my custom hard-mounted soft pads that we ended up using for one of the routines for the competition.
979366	979787	Good times.
979867	981930	I beat my first nine-footer on those pads.
982010	982791	Me too, actually.
983612	985455	I think my second was on those pads.
985555	986376	I beat my first nine-footer.
986556	1002200	But, um, yeah, I mean, and then I remember there was the little gazebo that was out there before you could go out to the golf course and just, it was all the, you know, Bay Area DDR people just took over that place and, like, families were trying to come in there and stuff and we'd get scared off by the conversation that was going on.
1002300	1003621	I mean, it's just, we re-
1004381	1005561	We ruled the school there.
1005862	1008542	Just start pulling out with random tunic tunic tunes.
1008742	1008942	Yes.
1009523	1010643	Except for the batting cages.
1010763	1011583	Those we didn't touch.
1011603	1014264	And then you remember all the bad things that happened to that place.
1015004	1021667	The time that they took it to the best of Sacramento or something like that and the speakers fell off or the marquee fell off of the thing.
1021747	1026388	And they put boombox speakers up there or something like that.
1027239	1033204	Although I do remember that we had the donated subwoofer for 2DX that would vibrate your knees.
1033504	1033784	Yes.
1034985	1036006	That was awesome.
1036766	1043191	What was great, too, is that because we knew the arcade techs, a DDR4 mix machine would load edits that you made at home.
1043212	1045213	You could actually save a limited number of edits on the machine.
1045453	1046954	And he would load our edits.
1047014	1053780	And I remember we had, or at least, I don't know if it was me or you, we had an edit for Kick the Can called Big Cans.
1054440	1055081	You mean that.
1055761	1082165	all it was so you could fire up big cans and you'd see it on the machine now playing big cans and what it was is that it would start for like you know the song started with this fun little dance for like four measures and it was just a giant break in the song so people would literally start big cans play the first four measures run a lap around the entire arcade and get back just in time to hit that last right at the end
1083895	1088518	Remember the Hell Edit competitions too, which I've won lots of good porn that way.
1089419	1090280	Thank you, Loki.
1090300	1093061	MakeEditGetPorn, yeah, it was awesome.
1093101	1095783	That was one of the early things on OLR, I remember MakeEditGetPorn.
1095943	1099186	Someone passed my Hell Edit, my DXYM Hell Edit.
1099266	1101087	It was that skinny kid Dave.
1102368	1102848	He won.
1102988	1103709	Sign and beat it.
1103829	1105110	He won, yes, he won.
1105510	1109253	When we went on the moderator trip for DDR Freak back when.
1109793	1110353	Sign and beat it.
1110654	1111274	I bought him dinner.
1113058	1118341	We can't forget the awesomeness that was at Shaft, that was Wendell's famous roast beef routine.
1119402	1119602	Yes.
1120162	1126945	And we, of course, can't forget the travesty that was my attempt at freestyle, which we shall never hear of again, goddammit.
1126965	1128066	You're the one that brought it up.
1129086	1131828	Wasn't that the first time I ever did my Dr. Dick character, too?
1132668	1133128	Ah, yes.
1133349	1135630	Imagine me doing drag, but not doing drag.
1135690	1138391	That was my Dr. Dick character that I would do.
1139312	1141913	Didn't Dr. Dick eventually, though, turn into Mr. Spanky?
1142739	1146040	On OLR, so OLR is the spiritual successor to all of that.
1146220	1147520	Like Rob, but gayer.
1148380	1150881	Anyway, alright, look, we gotta get into... There's gayer than Rob?
1152241	1152761	Hey!
1152781	1158363	Alright, we gotta get into... Oh, I'm sorry, that's still supposed to come in a couple weeks.
1158403	1160163	That's when I get to start attacking you again.
1161263	1161804	Can't wait.
1161944	1163264	I guess I have to play nice on your show.
1163284	1164304	This is a warm-up, warm-up.
1164324	1164564	Oh, boy.
1164604	1165885	Oh, no, no, you can continue.
1165945	1166485	I'm enjoying it.
1167325	1169365	I'll just sit back here and go, writing this down.
1169505	1171586	He's like, crap, now I remember what it was like.
1171906	1197869	so if you think our reminiscing tonight is bad over nine years ago and everything we were doing back then just wait until next year because I'm telling you we're renting the Masonic Lodge or something and we're just gonna we're gonna rule the school and get everybody in one place get out all the DDR pads have like an OLR con or something that's that's my dream for a 10th anniversary thing and get everybody in one roof and just just blow the roof off the place be fun good times
1198228	1201070	Remember our awesome sack anime panel that we did?
1201611	1204273	Yeah, when we did the sack anime panel about three years ago?
1204733	1208416	Oh, that was so... I think I had like a double coffee.
1208576	1209897	Literally two people showed up.
1210257	1211458	Yeah, you and one other kid.
1211518	1212999	But you know what I got out of that whole thing?
1213820	1214240	My Dalek.
1216050	1217651	I've got that on reserve for you, Jamie.
1218552	1219453	Let's move on, guys.
1220414	1223416	Let's get into your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.
1223496	1226979	Nine years later, what are the console games or PC games making up your week?
1227319	1227860	DarkSakura.
1228040	1228700	I played WoW.
1230362	1230722	Damn it.
1231523	1241751	But I'm actually going to be getting myself a month card for Star Trek Online so that my Scottish fleet mates will not keep harassing me.
1242071	1242712	Are they missing you?
1242872	1243452	They miss me.
1243512	1248596	Well, okay, one of my fleet mates is on my Facebook, and he's such a nice guy.
1248616	1258883	He's actually the first person that I met in-game there that I chatted with, other than someone who was actually role-playing Captain Jack Harkness from Torchwood, which was gorgeous.
1260644	1269470	But we just ended up chatting, and we were at the same level, and we kept playing, and then he got me into the fleet, and I was like, woo, I get to listen to Scottish men's.
1269610	1270171	That's awesome.
1270911	1276677	So I might be getting a month on STO before the funds run dry.
1278139	1278459	All right.
1278519	1280481	So thinking about more MMOs to go play.
1280661	1281923	Initial D Extreme Stage.
1282564	1286988	We're going to have news later on tonight about a pretty big MMO that is going free to play.
1287389	1290071	So I'm curious if that's going to be something you're going to want to go to as well.
1290352	1291032	Be interesting to see.
1291092	1292254	Because free MMOs are good.
1293089	1293990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1311852	1312813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1333260	1335261	Yeah, you can't leave town because you'll just, oh, dead.
1335361	1336702	Oh, because it was Halloween.
1337262	1337822	Oop, dead.
1337842	1338423	That's fun.
1338503	1339583	Walk along, oop, dead.
1339743	1343165	That was, that was, the whole thing is like, oh, you're walking along, oh, dead.
1343245	1344385	We're putting a random mob there.
1344926	1345706	Yeah, how about no?
1346566	1347727	Yeah, so no more RO for me.
1348996	1363545	Alright, well let's go Oh, one more thing Lots of peggle in WoW Because I've been sitting my ass in queue for 35 minutes of pop Because I like DPS too much Done Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1364328	1365870	It's okay, I didn't play a whole lot this week.
1366190	1371655	I played, let's see, more Child of Eden, which is pretty awesome.
1371675	1373616	I actually got to play it on the HGTV this time.
1374077	1379702	It does get quite difficult when you're using the controller, like about even the third level in or whatever.
1380823	1383105	So I'm actually looking forward to trying it with the Kinect.
1383125	1386568	I think it'll be a lot more accurate.
1387568	1402223	um, played a bit of Shadows of the Damned which is a very strange game and there's lots of penis references all throughout the game the entire fucking game is just penis references but it's cool where can I buy this game?
1403937	1404737	at your local store
1421243	1422724	We actually have a clip from the game.
1423064	1424124	This is Shadows of the Damned.
1424144	1426405	This is a clip actually from the Akira Yamaoka soundtrack.
1426525	1430567	I know a lot of you have been eagerly anticipating hearing some of the soundtrack.
1430607	1431327	Here you go.
1450916	1453339	Gentlemen, here's a little number I tossed off recently in the kettlebell.
1454660	1456222	Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?
1457623	1459325	Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong?
1460407	1462889	It's swell to have a stiffy, it's divine to own a dick.
1463270	1466093	From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick.
1466974	1469196	So three cheers for your Willie or John Thomas.
1470338	1472160	Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake.
1473217	1486111	Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock You can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock But don't take it out in public or they will stick you in the dock And you won't come back Thank you very much
1487659	1489079	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1515334	1515574	LARP
1540794	1543776	All right, so you've been playing Penis of the Damned, and what, two penises up?
1544696	1545176	It's awesome.
1545216	1545977	It's a pretty fun game.
1546117	1549318	I'm actually looking forward to... No, I'm never going to finish this game.
1549518	1549899	You know why?
1549919	1556462	Because Earth Defense Force... Insect Armageddon is going to be coming out not next week, but the week after.
1556622	1557262	But hey, you know what?
1557282	1558303	I don't know if I can get it early.
1558903	1564786	And that's all I'll be playing at the end of this next week, so I don't care about finishing this game or anything else.
1565126	1566948	because this game will take over my life.
1567069	1572836	Great, so when we ask you about your gaming week for the next six months, it's just going to be, ah, I played Insect Arm again.
1572936	1573537	What if it sucks?
1573957	1574758	It's going to suck.
1574859	1576661	The first game sucked, but it was fun.
1576681	1577422	That was the whole point.
1577854	1578474	I want this game.
1578514	1579335	It's pretty awesome.
1607925	1609727	I believe your husband will have it soon.
1610768	1611048	Really?
1611608	1612409	Wow, you're a prophet.
1613150	1615051	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1616232	1618674	Grand Theft Auto.
1618834	1622137	Almost made it a whole week where I was just on a winging streak the entire week.
1622478	1624719	I did lose one game in the middle there and I was out of day.
1626761	1628241	I'll try next week.
1629642	1631142	Sorry, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.
1631682	1633663	This is like bubble wrap.
1633923	1635664	It's like the world's biggest bubble wrap.
1635824	1637264	But you can't pop the bubbles.
1637684	1642245	So I keep sitting here trying to pop the bubbles on this world's biggest bubble wrap.
1642285	1644126	And they don't pop, Jessica.
1645786	1647107	If you rip into it, that's cheating.
1647807	1648747	You can't use your nails.
1648807	1652428	I can pop it, but I don't want to ruin that piece of bubble wrap.
1652528	1653989	Unless I can ruin that piece of bubble wrap.
1656792	1657693	This is great radio.
1657853	1659355	The sound of... No, no, no, no, no.
1659375	1659976	That's cheating.
1660377	1661598	That is cheating with scissors.
1662620	1663481	My house, I can cheat.
1663841	1671312	Can you picture that and put it on the website so at least there's some... All you would have to do is just roll it up into a ball and it would have worked.
1671332	1673375	I don't see why twisting it would be cheating though.
1673993	1677075	Alright, Jessica, I know you don't- Thank you!
1677095	1678055	Oh my gosh, she got one!
1678075	1679516	That's what I said, you twist it.
1679936	1680156	Wow.
1680356	1682958	Alright, Jessica, I know you don't just play DDR.
1683998	1684719	I play DDR.
1684739	1687000	You know why I won't do?
1687620	1689021	Because look at it, it's not just one bubble.
1690143	1691024	It's multi-bubble.
1691104	1692345	Enough with the bubble wrap!
1692886	1694407	We're playing, you know, a game right now.
1694848	1696810	I was trying to understand the physics behind it, Rob.
1696830	1698211	Don't you ever watch Mr. Wizard's World?
1698772	1699813	Don't you ever want to know?
1699833	1700854	He's dead, Jamie.
1700954	1702035	And he hated children!
1702716	1703657	And he hated children.
1706580	1708782	Anyway, Jessica, how was your gaming week?
1710356	1711957	I played what I always play.
1712177	1714098	Lots and lots and lots of Lotro.
1715139	1716640	And lots and lots of Lotro.
1717000	1717801	And more Lotro.
1717921	1719602	Dude, what is it with chicks and MMOs?
1722103	1722864	Okay, dealer.
1725265	1730969	It's funny you guys were talking about the whole free MMO thing, because Lotro is a free MMO, though I am a subscriber.
1732118	1740260	I think it was a good thing for them to do because they brought in a lot of people and it was because of bringing in those people that they gained more of an audience for their subscriptions.
1741320	1754182	Out of curiosity, when Lotro went free to play, did a lot of the existing fan base say, we're going to reject these free people and this is going to be horrible and we don't want new people coming into our turf?
1754682	1756503	Was it received with a bunch of negativity?
1756523	1758063	Well, I wasn't on at that point in time.
1758523	1766867	I came in a little bit after that, but I do hear even to this day, everything changed when we went free to play.
1766887	1770088	The types of people that we're playing now are completely different.
1770168	1774710	I can understand that you're going to end up with a lot more
1775470	1777431	of a crowd that is flaky.
1778811	1783233	If people have their money put into a game, then yeah, they're a little bit more indebted to it.
1783253	1784613	They're going to play it more often.
1784633	1785573	It just makes sense.
1786714	1797197	That said, I too have a Star Trek Online account that I pay for monthly that just sits there with my level 10 lieutenant commander.
1797217	1799778	It doesn't really matter all the time.
1799798	1801518	You're still going to have the same type of flaky people.
1802799	1803079	I don't know.
1803879	1806060	It's topical because there's something else going on this week.
1806100	1806860	That's why I asked.
1807380	1813863	The main thing is we're getting ready right now for Isengard is going to be the next update in September.
1813963	1820565	So everybody's doing their pre-purchase and you get your snazzy stuff like your snazzy horse or your snazzy outfit and everything.
1821806	1827768	But the one thing I like is I get a 25% XP buff on any of my characters that are below the level cap.
1828428	1832589	and for me who's right there just barely below the level cap, that helps.
1833109	1834390	It gives me that little extra push.
1835490	1836130	Awesome.
1836150	1837431	Will that bring you up?
1838191	1838331	Huh?
1838471	1839471	Will that bring you up to the level?
1840531	1841752	I'm still working on it.
1841812	1846993	It's just a 25% extra buff so that you're gaining 25% more XP per kill.
1847714	1853575	Plus on top of it we're in the middle of the Summer Festival so you automatically are getting a buff from that as well on XP.
1853675	1856396	So any kills that I've made this weekend have basically just
1858073	1860015	I'm getting mad, mad XP from.
1860275	1860535	Cool.
1860996	1866060	Let me ask this because, you know, Lord of the Rings really isn't big in pop culture right now.
1866100	1868421	I mean, it was, you know, a few years ago when the movies were coming out.
1868461	1870263	But, you know, obviously it's always going to have its fan base.
1870603	1874386	But the reason why I say that is because, you know, we have these Hobbit movies that are on the horizon.
1874406	1875407	We're hearing more about that.
1876168	1881652	You know, that's going to kind of bring more attention back in pop culture to all things Lord of the Rings and Tolkien and all that.
1881732	1885395	So how do you think the MMO will be impacted by the Hobbit?
1885655	1892358	Oh, I would not be surprised if you would end up seeing a huge surge of people that were going to start joining after that.
1892498	1905004	I mean, on top of that, you're also we're also seeing a lot of people right now because movie theaters all across the country are showing the original movies on big screen one night per week.
1905105	1907226	So last week they did, you know, the original.
1907506	1910107	Now they're doing two towers this week and next week's going to be, you know.
1910516	1911537	Dan's going to that on Tuesday.
1911817	1912057	Yeah.
1912518	1916160	So that in and of itself is getting a lot more interest.
1916180	1917902	So I look forward to it.
1917942	1923506	I actually, you know, the kinship that I'm a part of is very newbie friendly.
1924246	1929390	And we like to be able to help each other kind of move on in the game.
1929590	1934714	And we welcome anybody, no matter if they're paid to play or not, in our kinship.
1934754	1934934	Yeah.
1935214	1936075	Yay, go Arlequins!
1936375	1936936	Yay!
1937416	1939017	It's very warm and fuzzy and friendly.
1939037	1939978	Well, and it helps too.
1940799	1950968	It helps too because not only do I have two of my old coworkers in my kinship, the leader is somebody that I knew from IRC that I met like way back in the day.
1951108	1957554	So it's really kind of spiffy that I get to have that kind of connection with two different, completely different portions of my life at the same time.
1957910	1958170	Awesome.
1958290	1959712	MMOs, bringing people together.
1959812	1960232	There you go.
1960432	1961573	All right.
1961713	1964736	Drew Nami, anything you want to say about your gaming week and what you've been playing?
1965297	1973284	I've been playing a bunch of the WoW crack and not really encountering those insane queue times because I play a healer, but I can understand.
1973304	1973964	What kind of healer are you?
1974945	1978008	I'm main a priest, but I'm starting up a shaman lately.
1978428	1979229	You're a 40, right?
1979369	1980310	Holy Pally's the best.
1981731	1983853	I never really got into the Holy Pally stuff, but...
1985174	1994859	Aside from that, I've been playing a lot of Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War 2, Retribution, you know, Electric Boogaloo, over too many subtitles.
1997260	2010326	And speaking of games that have gone free-to-play, or have been free-to-play for a while, Steam kind of kicked off some stuff, and I kind of got into making a Champions Online character, trying to get into the whole Silver Age thing.
2010426	2011727	I'm like, ehhh...
2013028	2026583	I heard Champions Online kind of tepid, like a lot of people weren't really into it when it first came out Then it went free to play and suddenly way more people were into it I was in the beta, it got better, it got better, not great, but it got better But I started up a grimoire named 23, numerologist, yay
2029906	2036789	You know, a lot of people too with that game forget that they were going to put that on 360 and then at the last minute it just didn't end up happening.
2037129	2043311	But it's funny because if you plug in an Xbox 360, Alan told me about this, you plug in a 360 controller, it will show... It works.
2043351	2045692	Yeah, everything shows up with the Xbox buttons and everything.
2045752	2047013	But not very well.
2047853	2048413	I tried.
2048453	2053235	I actually had to struggle to get it not to recognize 360 control and let me use the damn keyboard.
2054475	2057857	Because I have my controller plugged in all the time.
2057877	2058217	Mm-hmm.
2058917	2063760	But aside from that, you know, WoW, Dawn of War, Champions Online, haven't really been playing much.
2063780	2077027	I've been thinking about getting back into playing some Wii games I'd set on the shelf, playing through No More Heroes 2 again, and just kind of going through my game archive stuff I hadn't finished.
2077387	2078148	Rogue Galaxy.
2078328	2079168	That's what I'm doing right now.
2079548	2080829	Shadow Hearts from the New World.
2081329	2084251	Just, you know, some older PS2 stuff because I'm a broke ass like that.
2084991	2111424	Alright, well there you go Lots of archive gaming and free gaming Yeah, also scaring the crap out of myself with Dead Space But that's another story altogether Let's see my gaming week quickly and then we'll get into the gaming news I actually don't have a lot to add to my gaming week this week It's really the same games It's funny because I've been gaming a lot But I have nothing new to share with you all Because I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy XIII I'm finally to the point where the game has opened up
2111804	2134391	and if you've played through 13 you know exactly what point of the game I'm talking about and you know that took many many hours to get there but I'm actually really into it and again I don't get the 13 hate like this is seriously one of my favorite Final Fantasy games like I like it more Nate that's for sure so I'm having a great time with it so I am gonna play it through to completion and that is because even though yes some of the characters are just so
2137673	2141715	I really, really have a boner for Fang, who is an amazing character.
2141855	2142195	Love her.
2143236	2144436	Strong woman, like her.
2145737	2147398	I'm just playing for Fang at this point.
2147518	2147898	She's great.
2147918	2148679	And I like Lightning, too.
2149477	2150258	Is that Fang Service?
2150718	2152479	Yes, it's Fang Service.
2154140	2155841	I see Drew Nami is rubbing off on you.
2156801	2158022	He's sitting next to me.
2158082	2159043	I'm getting infected.
2159583	2166727	Also, Warcraft, Mortal Kombat played online for a little bit with Extifer from the other show, Horde House.
2167988	2169508	He's really getting into Mortal Kombat.
2169548	2170289	It's really funny.
2170529	2172050	He's almost beat story mode, I think.
2172370	2173391	Thanks for watching!
2190558	2191779	Nothing really new to share.
2191939	2193321	Hopefully in the coming weeks I will.
2193581	2197764	I actually have some racing games sitting at home that came from my rental service that I'm waiting to play.
2197824	2203910	So I'm hoping I'll have a Need for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited 2 things to say in the coming weeks because I have both of those sitting at home.
2204670	2206452	I want to know who the fuck Penis Man is.
2209761	2214484	Again, one of those sound clips I'd like to save to a soundboard and use on a rainy day sometime.
2215265	2218727	Chat.orangelandre.com if you would like to offend DarkSakura with your name.
2219448	2220228	It's Breakman.
2220668	2226032	Anyhow, let's move on to... We're going to get into gaming news, but first some housekeeping tonight.
2226312	2227493	Good Lord, it's been nine years.

2236498	2239319	And yeah, please join us on those sites.
2239639	2241440	And of course, I want to plug one more time.
2241460	2248284	Jess Carper is here tonight to help plug Under Sedation Live, which is the show that was before Orange Lounge Radio.
2248304	2249445	It was actually on that show.
2249485	2251666	That was a show born of the Rocky Horror Community.
2251686	2252907	I don't think a lot of people know that.
2252927	2253187	Right.
2253207	2253327	Right.
2253607	2263310	Understation Live is on Saturday nights at 8 o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern So it's a late show It's understationlive.org And Travis actually just revamped the entire website this week
2281557	2300719	and on top of that he just updated all of the podcasts so now everything is up there up to week before last he didn't do last week's because it was a solo show because I was out and about so yeah basically everything through episode 36 is up on the web
2300879	2301339	Did you kidnap a child?
2301379	2301920	I kidnapped a child
2330174	2336019	Alright, anyhow, let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.
2336279	2336579	Loki.
2338341	2344986	So, Monday, this coming up Monday, there's going to be some stuff going down in California.
2345126	2352632	The case Brown vs. EMA, which is formally Schwarzenegger vs. EMA, involving California's attempt to enforce a law written by...
2353493	2363522	Thank you, Leland Yee, a Democrat representing San Francisco in 2005, that would criminalize the sale of hyper-violent games to kids.
2364122	2369507	And it's not necessarily all M-rated games, but only certain types of games as defined by the law.
2369867	2380536	These new games would need to be labeled specially and carry a $1,000 fine to those who are found in violation of the law.
2383881	2393355	If the court rules for California, it will be overturning a half decade's worth of decisions in lower courts that said California's law violated First Amendment protections of freedom of speech.
2395360	2411366	um apparently also it doesn't necessarily mean if the court decides that it's against um you know the first amendment it says they could still direct the state in how to write the law that would criminalize the sale of games to kids without violating the constitution um
2412646	2413006	I don't know.
2413226	2425511	So basically, if they win, they're going to separate video games from music, movies, and books and all their forms of entertainment, singling them out, preventing them from going to be sold for minors and stuff like that.
2427435	2427895	Okay, what?
2428396	2432399	DarkSakura is saying, is this more important than a Supreme Court hearing on video games?
2432419	2432639	Yes, it is.
2432659	2434080	Does it change the way we buy games?
2434180	2434701	Yes, it is.
2434781	2435541	I'm dying to hear this.
2435942	2436482	It's cake.
2437483	2437663	Oh.
2437863	2441466	Happy birthday to you.
2442026	2445008	Happy birthday, dear Rob.
2446430	2448751	Happy birthday to you.
2448791	2450453	Oh, thank you, guys.
2450533	2452234	Yeah, it's my birthday, too.
2452254	2453435	Not just the show's.
2453806	2454686	I have to make a wish?
2455126	2455386	Yes.
2455686	2458627	Okay, do I have to say my wish or do I have to keep a secret?
2458647	2460308	You can tell us after the show.
2461048	2466209	One, two... Way to blow, Rob.
2466889	2468230	He sure knows how to blow.
2468290	2469870	He's gone from suck to blow.
2471590	2473171	Yay, I blew them all out.
2473191	2473471	Yay.
2473731	2475151	Thank you for not setting the cake on fire.
2475912	2476952	I appreciate that.
2477572	2480713	Because there are not 30 candles on that cake.
2480733	2480993	There's...
2482441	2482901	Far less.
2484802	2486623	I'll get plates while Loki finishes his story.
2486763	2487583	See?
2487623	2488064	Told you!
2488244	2490184	Alright, and that's not a Bel-Air cake.
2490245	2491245	That is a homemade cake.
2491285	2493946	Becky made the icing and everything from scratch.
2494086	2494586	That's great.
2494987	2495587	Thank you so much.
2495627	2496147	Thank you, Becky!
2496167	2497748	You're welcome!
2498008	2498668	Isn't she sneaky?
2499088	2499369	Anyhow.
2500049	2502490	So yeah, it sucks and hopefully it doesn't pass.
2502510	2507152	Because, I mean, seriously, there's enough reasons to hate the government in California.
2509003	2519068	And Leland Yee, seriously, this guy has a hard-on for writing terrible laws that involve protecting the children.
2521650	2522090	What douche.
2525686	2529228	Sorry, I was relaying for the chatroom that they wanted a picture.
2529628	2534691	You know, all that neutering, all that happy just neutered my rant.
2535031	2535491	I know, right?
2536011	2539393	It's like, I wanted to say a lot of angry things, but how can I be mad?
2539453	2540414	Someone bake me a cake.
2541634	2541734	But...
2543135	2545556	Seriously, what the hell is this supposed to solve?
2545996	2550197	Ignorant parents are still going to buy their kids M-rated games and not worry about it.
2550357	2556619	Drew, I kind of feel like this discussion is like – I mean I'm not invalidating your point, but it's kind of like there's nothing we can do about this now.
2556919	2563321	The reality is tomorrow is a huge day because – and what I'm reminded of is –
2564321	2579451	Other news that came out, it was either this week or last week about cigarette label warnings are supposed to get even bigger and like more, they're like the Canadian warnings now where like in Canada you buy the pack of smokes and it shows like the decayed lungs and all that stuff and it's like, okay, we get the point, God.
2579711	2581632	You know, it's the same point with both of them.
2582052	2582452	and DarkSakura.
2598380	2600382	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2613912	2615192	to keep their family-friendly appearances.
2615732	2616293	Period.
2616373	2616833	End of story.
2616853	2618393	It should be done the same as movies.
2618753	2620133	Why can't it just mirror movies?
2620853	2623534	Because these are interactive, Rob!
2623594	2629595	You have to understand, people are playing the role of the killer instead of watching the killer brutally kill people.
2629915	2636157	I have a hard time believing that the penis game is worse for kids than the human centipede.
2636317	2636837	I'm sorry.
2638843	2652914	or any of the Saw movies they can't be consistent because that would actually make sense and they lose their jobs if they actually make sense it's all about trying to get a platform so he gets voted in or something like that I don't even know what the point of this is
2657200	2661101	Are legal analysts trying to predict this one way or the other?
2661161	2663702	Does anybody have a reading on which way this is going to go?
2663882	2669283	They figured that the way that this law has gone in other states, it's not going to pass.
2670404	2671724	And here's the best thing apart.
2672144	2678166	The best part about it is it's our tax money that the state is using to fight this thing.
2680046	2680727	Thanks.
2682367	2683188	I want a refund.
2684549	2686010	Well, that's not having the intended effect then.
2686050	2686550	I really am...
2708855	2715718	I like how they handle it in England, where movies and games have the same rating system.
2716199	2717059	I'm so with you.
2717159	2717859	I'm so with you.
2717879	2723502	Just give games the exact... I mean, I guess we're kind of past the point of no return, so to speak.
2723522	2726423	We've already had this rating system that's been established and in place for years.
2726443	2728784	It's not that difficult to understand the rating system, though.
2728804	2729144	I mean, how...
2730445	2732085	Much more do we need to explain.
2732165	2740388	I don't think it's necessarily that these people don't know what the rating system is or that these games are violent.
2740428	2741668	I think they just don't care.
2742148	2748610	It's just like, oh, I don't care if I get cancer from smoking or I don't care if I get liver damage from drinking.
2748710	2749870	They just don't care.
2750270	2753611	And no amount of laws and stickers and banners and...
2755091	2758233	and whatever are going to get these people to care anymore.
2758953	2768818	Unless you say, oh, you bought this for your child, we're going to fine you $1,000, then... In the immortal words of Bill Murray, it just doesn't matter.
2769358	2770979	Or how about Dennis Leary?
2771479	2772680	It's a drug, we're addicted!
2773672	2776233	Some not very encouraging words from Blackwolf in the chatroom.
2777013	2783076	Saying, Sky, the mock trials that some law schools have done said that the Supreme Court will side with California.
2784096	2784837	Well, then they're dumb.
2785297	2785737	I'm sorry.
2786057	2786677	That's sad.
2786878	2788638	We're in a really sad state.
2788718	2791319	If they single this out, then they need to fight this.
2791339	2792700	They need to appeal it and they need to fight it.
2792740	2794981	It's the Supreme Court, Loki.
2795021	2796622	You can't appeal that.
2796662	2799263	There is no court higher in the land than the Supreme Court.
2800643	2808566	I'm sorry though, but you're singling, basically you're restricting the freedom of expression because you're restricting the sale of these certain games.
2808907	2813168	Which have not even been proven to cause any harm to children anyways.
2813629	2816230	Crime rates actually decreased since the Super Nintendo came out.
2816250	2821092	So there's no, it's not like, you know, smoking, that's a pretty easy distinction.
2821712	2824093	You're talking about all hypothetical stuff, we don't...
2824833	2831720	There's no... Like, playing a violent video game doesn't make me catch on fire or, you know, doesn't make my lungs deteriorate.
2831860	2833662	It's just a game.
2833862	2838386	Loki, welcome to America, home of unnecessary moral panic.
2839648	2843752	It was like this for D&D, it was like that for Doom, it's gonna continue.
2843932	2847155	And how many of us who were raised on D&D are sacrificing chickens in the backyard?
2847945	2849526	Don't check my backyard, Jamie, I swear to God.
2849546	2850467	Here's my thing.
2850687	2862353	If this comes down tomorrow and it doesn't go the way we think it should, the only way you can quote-unquote retaliate is with your vote and stop voting for people that are going to shove moral righteousness down our throat.
2862393	2863193	Do not vote for Leland Yee.
2863213	2864514	Who is voting for Leland Yee?
2864794	2866335	San Francisco, I blame you.
2866575	2867656	This is all your damn fault.
2867676	2868316	Is he his sister?
2868336	2869116	I thought he was SoCal.
2869276	2870437	No, he's San Francisco.
2870797	2872138	He's San Francisco, and guess what?
2872708	2882203	You know, this is the same type of shit that they passed over there was banning toys from Happy Meals because that'll get people to stop buying fast food for their children.
2884483	2887706	Yeah, people not being stupid will do that.
2887726	2893070	Well, San Francisco's also got the whole thing about, what is it, they want to ban circumcision or something like that.
2893090	2893570	Oh, yeah.
2894231	2897374	Listen, San Francisco, you're already fucking strange enough as it is.
2897574	2900716	Clearly, there are other things we need to legislate.
2900756	2911145	But then you go, well, everybody is... You do that, that's going to start coming into line with religious tolerance groups.
2911565	2915007	Because the Anti-Defamation League has already gotten in on that.
2922771	2924192	Everybody in San Francisco has healthcare.
2924832	2930676	And whether you're a fan of socialized healthcare or not, you have to admit, that's quite a feat that they're doing it.
2930936	2933037	I mean, that it's happening there.
2933297	2938780	Whether you're a fan of that theory or not, you gotta say, wow, that is quite a political feat that they're doing it.
2938800	2939581	Yeah, here's what they're doing.
2939601	2941022	They're wasting money is what they're doing.
2941242	2945084	They're wasting money by giving everybody healthcare, whether you deserve it or not.
2945524	2948146	And they're also wasting money with all these fucking laws that they're trying to pass.
2948926	2951747	No, we... They deserve... Yeah, you know what?
2951787	2952748	They're not fucking working.
2952768	2953828	They don't deserve healthcare.
2954428	2956089	You gotta pitch in to get something back.
2956109	2956609	You know what?
2956669	2957970	What about if somebody... You know what?
2958670	2962131	I will tell you this right now, and you're about to get the verbal bitch slap from me.
2963132	2964252	I got laid off of my job.
2964432	2965253	I have been applying.
2965353	2966073	Dan has been applying.
2966133	2967634	Neither of us have insurance right now.
2968154	2969975	And if he had another heart attack, what would we do?
2970095	2970535	He would die.
2971175	2971696	End of story.
2972016	2976699	Because we can't afford... I understand that, but you were working at one time, so you have already contributed to society.
2976739	2983324	There were a lot of people that are homeless on the street now because they lost their jobs, their houses were foreclosed on, and they have nowhere to live.
2983384	2986387	We know a person personally in that circumstance.
2988300	2990762	So yeah, think before you say shit like that, please.
2991502	2992783	I'm sorry, it's my opinion, okay?
2993243	2993664	I don't care.
2993764	2996606	Some of these people that are homeless, they choose to be homeless.
2996826	3004991	There's been tons of studies where people have tried to help these people out, and sure enough, they give them money or whatever, and they're back on the street again because they can't fend for themselves.
3005071	3008654	Nine years stands for... It's a stint in the ranks right there.
3008754	3013477	Well, it's like a married couple, but I could cue up the penis song again if that's what we need.
3013557	3018040	Let's just work towards getting our money spent on more important things, like putting shrimp on treadmills.
3020443	3022625	All I'm saying is that they're passing a lot of these laws.
3023066	3026409	Why don't you work on a state budget?
3027290	3027851	How about that?
3027871	3029973	Because they don't have that taken care of yet.
3030594	3031996	Yeah, but that's the city and not the state.
3035856	3038258	Okay, so yeah, tomorrow, big day for gamers.
3038418	3039738	It's going to be interesting.
3039819	3040379	I like cake.
3041179	3042480	This cake is delicious.
3042540	3043361	And it's not a lie.
3044982	3046022	This is legitimate cake.
3046383	3048924	And it's hilarious because I used to own those very same plates.
3051566	3052606	I've lost control.
3053207	3054327	You've had control?
3054628	3055608	Yeah, I never did.
3056049	3057690	Hey, let's talk about the PlayStation 4.
3059520	3061882	Nintendo has announced the Wii U.
3083584	3091586	And Jack Trenton said to Forbes, I didn't see anything about Nintendo's announcement that said, oh, we'd better get working on rolling out a new PlayStation here pretty soon.
3092206	3096467	What we've seen from the competition is trying to add features that already exist in the PlayStation 3.
3097528	3102129	We've invested heavily in that, and we've rolled a very heavy rock up a steep hill through the launch period.
3102409	3105690	But now I think that all pays off, and we've got a long runway behind it.
3105950	3110071	Very interesting that they call it a steep hill, kind of admitting that it was a rough launch for them.
3110191	3115313	He has a point, and the point is, also, if you think about it, Nintendo has never developed HD games.
3116934	3121876	I mean, they're way behind everybody else as far as putting out games that are high definition.
3122456	3125357	I don't know, it sells consoles, I guess they haven't had to so far.
3126638	3137042	Yeah, but you see, they'll get you only so far, then they realize, oh, hey, people that are hardcore gamers, the ones actually purchasing games other than, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort, um,
3138095	3140900	Let's assume they have enough money to buy an HDTV, first of all.
3141360	3142743	And then let's develop HD games.
3143264	3146008	You're right, because no one has HDTVs nowadays.
3146169	3151217	Oh my god, I'm just... Where am I going to find people that own HDTVs out there?
3153184	3160692	Everywhere is where I'm going to find them because they sell them everywhere and people have already adopted to that and they've already adopted to new HD formats.
3160812	3163715	I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.
3164035	3167158	I'm still busy watching UHF and sending out newsletters on a mimeograph.
3167218	3167519	Sorry.
3168560	3170522	I'm not saying no one owns HDTVs.
3171633	3173755	Well, I think also you have to look at this.
3173855	3179180	Now, you know, we're at this point where, yeah, there's some people that still have their standard definition TVs because they haven't had to upgrade.
3179200	3181722	But inevitably, those TVs will fail.
3181882	3182723	All TVs will fail.
3183103	3188448	And you can't buy a standard definition TV anymore unless it's at a garage sale or something.
3188488	3192772	I mean, if you go into a Target or a Walmart, you all only have HDTVs to choose from now.
3192981	3194622	I need to actually have a UHF-capable TV.
3194642	3194702	So.
3205567	3206728	Ah, alright.
3207388	3216192	So yeah, in a nutshell, he's basically saying, well, I don't see the need to hurry up and develop the PlayStation 4, because it looks to me like Nintendo's just trying to get up to the level of the PlayStation 3.
3217032	3217653	Bitch slap.
3218133	3222695	Funny for the ones that were a little late to the party with Move and shit like that.
3223135	3223395	Yeah.
3224135	3229698	And also, to their point, they're on the 10-year life cycle or whatever, so they're not going to deviate from that.
3230298	3238662	And I don't think you're going to see the same thing happening with Microsoft either, because they're confident that the Kinect is going to drive the console for the next five years or whatever.
3239282	3244264	And Nintendo, really, sales are dipping, and no one really gives a crap about...
3246065	3261493	there's gonna be the people that will buy every fucking Mario game that comes out Mario Kart game and Animal Crossing game even if it's just slightly different than the last one because they're suckers for that kind of stuff now at the same time though they need to get with it
3261693	3281281	because, you know, a standard definition console isn't going to cut it when, you know, let's say the next console generation rolls around, and they're going to be playing some catch-up when, you know, the next generation comes around, even though it is going to be able to pull, push a little bit better graphics than, you know, the 360 is, but they have to know how to use it.
3281481	3285283	Now, the third-party developers probably won't have a problem with that because they're used to developing HD games, but...
3286684	3288005	and Nintendo themselves.
3288986	3293732	I think you're going to see them struggling trying to figure out how to utilize this console.
3293992	3299779	And I think they're going to go more of the gimmicky route where cartoon graphics and shit with the touchscreen.
3300199	3302722	Yeah, they tend to be a little more agile as far as consoles go.
3302822	3303783	Thanks for watching!
3321506	3335863	In an interview with Famitsu Magazine, Suhei Yoshida, who's the president of Worldwide Studios for Sony, said that the reach-around panel almost was not on the final design because of cost.
3336583	3342347	Sony was not sure that it would really impact gameplay and maybe it's not worthy of the sticker price.
3343147	3347610	They say once people actually got their hands on it, that it became a must-have feature.
3348730	3352192	Some small elements of the Vita's design are still subject to change.
3352452	3353253	So we'll see what happens.
3354321	3354701	DarkSakura
3383522	3388305	We have some other news that is, well, it's Wii related.
3390786	3393448	How bad do you want Xenoblade for Wii?
3394088	3394928	How many people want it?
3396109	3400191	Well, apart from that, there's also the last story, Pandora's Tower.
3401192	3408476	Those are the set right there that actually people are asking to have released outside of Japan and Europe.
3409176	3412058	So we're hoping that Nintendo can bring it to the U.S.,
3415201	3417883	Online Petitions, Letter Writing, Physical Letters
3435373	3438595	Is it maybe something they're keeping in their hat for if Wii U gets delayed?
3463433	3464473	Well, there's more though.
3464833	3466974	Xenoblade was at E3 under a different name.
3468334	3473515	And they actually flat out asked Reggie about the titles and he just went, Oh, look, Pony.
3475116	3476356	I'm sorry, that's not a Mario game.
3476396	3477456	I don't know what you're talking about.
3479117	3482037	Take it from a Tales of fan, this shit never works.
3482578	3484518	This petitioning never ever works.
3486278	3489199	Well, it might work if you can get a million people to sign it.
3489479	3490099	Not even.
3490199	3492820	If they want to screw a particular audience, they will.
3494622	3495283	You know what I think?
3495683	3502385	And this is what I think for a lot of the big import titles or the big Japan-only releases that we want to see in America.
3503106	3506347	Do it like they handled the remastered Macross DVDs.
3507603	3513266	where you have a price set for if we have this many pre-orders, the game will be this price.
3513806	3514346	And we'll do it.
3515067	3518008	This is what it's gonna cost plus standard profit margin.
3518929	3523511	And then we get more pre-orders to this level, the price goes down.
3523811	3525812	We get more orders to this level, the price goes down.
3526294	3527395	So kind of a kickstart thing.
3527515	3535162	Since we're reminiscing about the past a lot tonight, it reminds me of what Konami did for Beatmania 2DX7 style when that finally came out on home consoles.
3535663	3540087	They basically said, if we can get 10,000 people to pre-order the game, we'll make it.
3540387	3543830	And it amazes me to this day that they got away with something like that.
3543850	3549555	Because you're putting down a full pre-order on a game you don't even know it's going to happen or not.
3550576	3550996	So it's kind of weird.
3551016	3553337	But if they say they're not going to do it, then they have to refund the money.
3553357	3553917	Yeah, I know that.
3553957	3559139	But it's still weird that so many people are willing to kind of put down the money up front on a maybe.
3559699	3560159	You know what I mean?
3560179	3561299	It's just crazy.
3561339	3562620	Fans will do stuff.
3563100	3567681	But you notice I brought up the Macross box set?
3568241	3568762	They did that.
3568882	3569802	It actually worked.
3570122	3574984	And the price went down for like a full series box set to something way low.
3575804	3576284	Just throw it away.
3576304	3576404	Hmm.
3579461	3601203	and you know if they do this I'm going to put this up because that's his middle finger folks because it's not a TV show uh yeah because I'm sorry it's it's stupid why make all your fans of your system jump through hoops to get a game put out over here you either do it because you want to put it out or you don't do it don't make people beg for it I mean
3602037	3603378	The bottom line, money.
3603978	3605039	It's all back to money.
3605520	3606981	It's a company, they need to make a profit.
3607121	3609382	And the Wii is not selling software right now.
3609503	3613185	And remember, it's all about ease of getting these games out.
3613245	3623112	It's a lot easier for them to take a GameCube game, pretty the graphics up a little bit, and port it back out, and call it like an anniversary collection or some bullshit like that.
3623693	3628576	And then charge, you know, 50 bucks, and then people will, you know, totally eat it up.
3629057	3629117	Or...
3632341	3633802	Apparently now Rob is called Roger.
3633962	3634823	It's alright, I'll take it.
3635003	3635483	Thank you.
3636964	3641627	Or they can spend the money it's going to take to localize a game that's pretty awesome.
3642447	3645489	They're not going to do that because localizing a game is going to take a lot of time.
3646914	3647854	and so on and so forth.
3676005	3683346	But now they're just saying, listen, we're just going to take properties that are over in Japan and just bring them over instead of making our own shit.
3683846	3687787	So that's who you need to pitch that game to is one of those companies.
3687847	3689407	Sounds like they're going to be the next Working Designs.
3689567	3691188	And they will basically do it for you.
3691948	3697669	Of course, after they get done with President Cat because they haven't started on President Cat yet and so we don't have that yet.
3697929	3698329	That's right.
3698409	3701370	You can't have the last story until we get President Cat.
3701930	3703130	That's just the way it's going to be.
3705565	3706906	All right, moving on.
3707846	3708847	Loki, what do you got for us?
3710467	3720931	So free-to-play, it's something that I believe when Nintendo was asked about it, they said, nope, we have no plans on putting anything free on our marketplace, you bastards.
3721331	3724933	At least as far as free-to-play MMOs or something like that.
3725313	3733096	Well, Microsoft's actually kind of feeling out with developers to see if they can get some free-to-play games.
3733836	3745127	and I guess they're now contacting studios discussing the possibility of free-to-play games and building some sort of infrastructure for the 360 that incorporates microtransactions.
3746208	3753495	Because they were like, Free Realms is so awesome on the PlayStation 3 and we want a game on Xbox where you can play as a fairy.
3753968	3761701	I don't think that they're necessarily doing that, but I think that they see the profit that, say, Farmville or the Smurfs Village stuff.
3762342	3765648	That makes a lot of money, and some people are looking for that kind of thing.
3765668	3765988	Maybe.
3767250	3767471	Maybe.
3771844	3775069	Would you be interested in free-to-play games on the Xbox, Loki?
3775089	3775510	No.
3775530	3775710	No?
3775770	3776110	Why not?
3776150	3778053	Just because the quality is less?
3778694	3781539	It's usually not the type of games that I want to play.
3781739	3785204	If it was like a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto MMO or something, that's a little different.
3786025	3807766	I'd at least check it out like you know uh heck I even played Yaris for like 10 seconds so all right um let's move on with some more gaming news and I'm gonna get to a story about PlayStation hardware in Japan I believe there's a new bundle that has uh come out there in Japan it's a
3808186	3815351	Charcoal Black Console, decreased power consumption they're saying, a 320 gig hard drive with it.
3815451	3820774	It's model CECH3000B and it was announced by Sony in Japan over the weekend.
3821495	3834884	It is going to be 34,980 yen and there will also be a 160 gig version of the model that will come with Tales of Zillia that is coming for $470 so you can get that game.
3835304	3837746	Not coming in this new bundle, an HDMI cable.
3838346	3838806	That is true.
3840287	3842148	And you know what else is coming in that bundle?
3843188	3845169	New game encryption.
3846349	3849610	Oh, is that really why they're trying to get the hardware out there?
3849951	3853452	They're putting out new hardware that's going to change the way the keys are stored.
3853952	3876808	Although it's got to have some sort of backwards compatibility because or I remember they're moving the instead of having the actual keys built in or the authentication keys built into the console itself it's being built into the blu-ray drive much like how the 360 works whereas they have it you know all the authentication stuff is through the blu-ray drive.
3877949	3881435	DarkSakura, what do you got for us before we get to release dates?
3888755	3892818	Well, we have some little buggies fixed with the 3DS.
3893078	3897662	There were a couple of problems the different consumers were saying that was going on.
3897682	3900944	And according to Mr. Reggie, he says they're fixed.
3901685	3908410	He said that the eShop is fixing one of them because, well... It didn't launch with the eShop.
3908690	3909891	It didn't shop with... yeah.
3911232	3913773	And the other thing is that...
3915905	3921072	They're basically... The biggest hang-up was that they didn't have a big Nintendo franchise.
3921632	3922994	So they said they're fixing that too.
3923675	3925237	In other words, we had no launch games.
3925437	3927680	Basically, is what I'm hearing out of that.
3927740	3928822	Well, that's why I didn't buy one.
3929122	3931185	Their strongest launch title was from Capcom.
3932912	3933772	I think it was Dead or Alive.
3934913	3936234	Unless you want to count Pilotwings.
3936334	3937975	Dead or Alive was apparently very terrible.
3938595	3940376	I've heard from a lot of people that Dead or Alive was really good.
3940496	3942037	Technically, it didn't launch with Dead or Alive.
3942097	3944678	I mean, Launch Window or whatever you want to call it.
3944698	3948000	That is some bullshit there, Launch Window.
3948520	3953523	Technically, it launched with the web store because it was within the Launch Window.
3954003	3956264	Well, how about I pay you at the end of the Launch Window?
3956304	3957025	How's that sound?
3957965	3958566	That doesn't work?
3958586	3958626	No.
3959446	3963327	I'm excited about, like, the idea that Netflix might come to the 3DS.
3963347	3967708	Because I like the idea of having kind of like the portable device to watch.
3967868	3978049	I mean, granted, I know there's the phone, but also not just the portable, like, thing in the bed with, I think, as a larger screen on those things, but also the possibility of actual 3D movies.
3978630	3982030	Even though a lot of 3D movies are kind of eh, it's kind of cool in a way.
3982250	3985651	I don't think it's going to be able to do 3D right since it's all lenticular anyway.
3985671	3985751	Yeah.
3986291	3987732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4010560	4015146	Hey, you gotta admit, if Tron's gonna end up on 3D Netflix, you gotta at least check that out.
4015907	4016928	That's gonna be pretty awesome.
4017169	4021014	You know, it was funny, right before Tron was coming out, Dan was like, let's go get a 3D TV, let's go get a 3D TV.
4021374	4022576	Tron's coming out, let's go get a 3D TV.
4023037	4023818	I'm like, no.
4025360	4025500	So.
4026847	4028748	Alright, so we'll see.
4029468	4031869	I'm really curious to see how 3DS will sell this holiday.
4032370	4034691	This is definitely going to be a make or break time for 3DS.
4034831	4037912	Well, I was just a little annoyed that they're talking about franchises coming out.
4037932	4041434	Look at all the things we announced that are going to be coming out.
4042454	4046336	All these different franchises that aren't coming out until the fourth quarter.
4046696	4049457	The 3DS is going to get really awesome soon.
4050138	4052198	Soon, like in a few months.
4053219	4054439	Right now you have a paperweight.
4055860	4056901	Enjoy your blue brick.
4057141	4065849	I gotta tell you though, I mean, based off of what's scheduled to come out for the 3DS, it's not all that exciting.
4065889	4067690	It's about as exciting as the DS is.
4069432	4073135	Unless you're really into Ocarina of Time, I mean, that's one of the stronger titles right now.
4073715	4080561	Yeah, but even new release stuff, there's really not anything exclusive for it.
4080581	4081922	It's like, oh my god, I gotta have that.
4084218	4086359	All right, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.
4086419	4091040	What can you get at a store near you for some other consoles in your house this week in the U.S.?
4091640	4098042	Well, today, and I know this was on everybody's radar, but Mystery Case Files, the Malgrave incident out for the Nintendo Wii.
4098082	4099242	Yes, that's the same.
4099342	4100702	I got to go get my preorder.
4100762	4103783	That's the same franchise that was on the DS.

4229106	4237192	and the same games Super Street Fighter 4 and Test Drive Unlimited 2 all making their way to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
4238113	4241175	Going over to some other consoles, how about the Sony PSP?
4241535	4245338	We have Initial D Street Stage getting a price reduction as well as some other releases.
4245738	4250101	Two Heart 2 Dungeon Travelers comes out in regular and limited edition.
4250141	4252243	Again, that's for the PSP.
4252363	4256486	This is a game, it's an RPG where...
4257526	4269531	I guess it's kind of like they're reliving their childhood fantasies or something, but then you have the chick in the maid outfit with her legs up, and you're like, I don't want to think about childhood fantasies and see those pictures, so I don't know.
4269892	4272072	It's a very... Kind of childhood fantasies.
4272092	4274554	Are they having pedo bear childhood fantasies?
4275334	4277595	That actually makes me think of an anime that I started watching.
4279452	4281614	On the Wii, do I even want to know what anime?
4281654	4283476	Are you sure it was an anime?
4283736	4287460	It's called something like My Little Sister Can't Be That Cute.
4288662	4295970	And basically this guy finds out that his sister, who's totally cool and popular with all of her friends and everything, is a closet otaku.
4296750	4299914	And her fandom is Little Sister Hentai.
4302924	4306545	On the Wii, Biohazard and Biohazard Zero get a price reduction.
4306565	4309105	The show itself isn't dirty, but she's into it.
4310106	4311966	Oh, Japan, never change.
4312086	4313966	You heard about the guy in Canada, right?
4314487	4321308	Brought manga over there and got arrested because of their child pornography laws or something like that.
4321408	4322068	Weird.
4323069	4324729	It faces a minimum of a year in jail.
4325389	4325729	Jeez.
4326549	4328790	Apparently all manga is banned there.
4330222	4332624	I guess it makes the video game laws here not seem so bad.
4353118	4364604	and then you can play the game and then remember how much better it was on the Nintendo 64 lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week Tales of the Abyss from Bandai Namco which is this an official Tales game?
4365512	4366792	Yes, it is.
4366832	4368633	It happens to be my favorite Tales game.
4368713	4369253	Well, guess what?
4369273	4370314	It's on the 3DS this week.
4370454	4371034	In Japan.
4371394	4372655	God damn it, Japan.
4373055	4373775	God damn it, Namco.
4373795	4375516	You can import it on your region free.
4375676	4375956	Oh, wait.
4375996	4376356	No, you can't.
4376496	4377176	Oh, wait.
4377196	4377576	That's right.
4377596	4380197	They got rid of that on the 3DS.
4380997	4382358	See, that's what I was talking about.
4382398	4385139	Namco always screwing over anything that's not Japanese.
4389682	4391484	Ore no Emoto ga Kona ni Kawaii Wake ni Ganai
4406983	4407804	It's actually really funny.
4407844	4410165	So are you stroking Penis Man's ego in the chat?
4411266	4416689	On the 28th, we have Call of Duty Black Ops, Annihilation Pack, whereas my brain initially saw it Black Oops.
4417610	4422413	And then on the 29th, we have Backbreaker Vengeance, which sounds kind of dirty.
4422993	4425635	And then Half Minute Heroes, Super Mega Neo Climax.
4427338	4428879	Which also sounds kind of dirty.
4429259	4429579	I know.
4430459	4431960	I wouldn't want to meet the half-minute hero.
4432000	4433760	That series is actually kind of cool.
4435301	4437942	That 30-second hero, whatever they call it here, is actually kind of fun.
4438182	4438862	It's a neat series.
4438902	4442144	I just wouldn't want to meet the half-minute hero in his climax.
4442824	4444925	Didn't they have that come out in Xbox Live Arcade?
4445005	4450307	I think I dated him.
4450327	4451947	Did he post on DDR Freak 2?
4453388	4453788	Shushu.
4456016	4456176	Oh.
4457997	4458458	Bob gets it.
4458978	4459278	Alright.
4459758	4459858	No.
4460559	4461699	I only have one thing to say about that game.
4461839	4462139	What's that?
4462339	4462700	Spoot.
4464340	4465021	Moving on.
4465841	4468762	Two more stories for you and then the classic game of the week.
4470023	4479968	So, I know this isn't the 90s and this isn't the Matrix but apparently Ubisoft wants you to beat Neo at Child of Eden.
4481048	4484590	A game that's sort of like the Matrix because you're I know Kung Fu.
4485501	4485981	Flying around.
4486362	4487283	Less Keanu Reeves.
4488423	4490165	But no, the artist Neo.
4490725	4494328	Apparently he has a high score on the Evolution level.
4495029	4505938	And to, I guess, boost Ubisoft's donation of the Japanese Earthquake Relief, you have to try to beat his score.
4506198	4514265	100,000 is already pledged, but for every score on the level, it's normal Connect leaderboard exceeding Neo's.
4515106	4526197	306,800 points between now and July 4th Ubisoft will add an additional dollar up to a maximum of $20,000 why Neo?
4526418	4533145	I don't understand why that artist out of you know I just don't think of Neo when I think of Child of Eden you know
4536400	4537781	Maybe he's a fan of the game.
4537921	4540643	Maybe Samuel L. Jackson had something else going on.
4542384	4546086	Ice-T, you know, he was too busy pimping Call of Duty.
4547928	4550309	Let me just compare a little bit here, okay?
4550649	4551810	We have Neo.
4552010	4552190	Ready?
4552210	4552791	Here's Neo.
4554532	4561897	Okay, I think I've heard that song at the club before, right?
4561917	4564859	So there's Neo, and then here is Child of Eden.
4577881	4581146	That's right, you're getting a headache because those two don't go together.
4581286	4582487	Completely different key.
4585131	4585452	Whatever.
4585942	4587642	I guess whatever brings awareness to the game.
4613487	4620033	And then there's been lots of, boo, this game I paid for five years ago is now free and that makes me angry.
4621314	4629001	Because, you know, games don't ever go on sale or... Oh no, that's totally not how I wound up with most of my Steam collection anyway.
4629041	4631443	There are so many butthurt people.
4631963	4633624	about this going free-to-play.
4633704	4638686	There are apparently servers that are auto-banning people that are detected on the free-to-play version.
4639126	4643188	There are people that are just like, our game is ruined because of free-to-play and so forth.
4643228	4648611	And to those people, I say, fuck off immediately because you are what's wrong with gaming right now.
4648731	4649751	Cry some more.
4649871	4655614	That whole elitist asshole attitude just isn't going to get you anywhere, like in life, period.
4655794	4662321	It reminds me of when Steam had the free weekends of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2, and Black Ops.
4663322	4668427	There was nothing but disdain to lower level folk because they were trial noobs.
4668447	4669969	They were weekend warriors.
4670610	4673032	They were too cheap to buy the real thing.
4673052	4674774	I'm like, dude, fuck you.
4674854	4677577	I might actually buy it if you guys weren't such dicks.
4678698	4681441	Yeah, I mean, and the game is five years old.
4681821	4692072	And to be fair, Valve, although they have done so many updates over the past few years and so forth, this has gotten people talking about the game more than anything in quite some time.
4692112	4694815	It's just a refreshing break from complaining about hats.
4696357	4696918	I guess so.
4697378	4698059	That could be true.
4698439	4702082	But yeah, I mean, I for one, I downloaded the game some time ago.
4702163	4704485	I paid for it, you know, it came with the orange box.
4705045	4711491	And I'm not mad that it went free to play because I realized I bought it several years ago and I could have been playing it then this entire time.
4712212	4713593	I didn't because I got old.
4714033	4714974	Why did it get old to me?
4715455	4719198	I had nobody to play with because I don't want to play with elitist assholes.
4719518	4720479	Well, gee, I'm sorry, Rob.
4720499	4721620	You should have poked me sometime.
4721740	4721841	But...
4723842	4724863	Not in that way, not that way.
4724883	4725904	Just buy me a drink first.
4727465	4739175	But, I mean, for real though, like, this news, if anything, makes me maybe want to go back and play Team Fortress 2 because I know there'll be other people to play with who will be as terrible as me or at least not be jerks about it if they are pretty good.
4739195	4740056	You know what I mean?
4742020	4746201	Otherwise, I hadn't really given this game a second thought, and yet I don't feel like I wasted my money.
4746521	4750302	The Orange Box was one of the best deals ever in gaming.
4750542	4752023	Ever one of the best deals.
4752223	4757884	Oh yeah, but where were people complaining when Portal became free for a limited time?
4758024	4758905	Hmm?
4760660	4762101	Oh wait, that's not multiplayer.
4762141	4764582	We're not an unpleasable fanbase when it comes to that, are we?
4765342	4768604	MeltedGeneral in our chat says Team Fortress 2 is on its 218th update.
4768624	4772465	That is a lot of updates.
4772505	4775507	Did it have you start downloading the Team Fortress 2 beta?
4776827	4778908	I don't know because I bought the game years ago.
4778928	4784350	I bought mine a long time ago and suddenly I looked on there and it says downloading Team Fortress 2 beta.
4785751	4786211	Which is weird.
4786411	4787832	It might be a free beta or something, who knows.
4788401	4794731	The Rob D in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, I'm pissed in the way anyone is when something goes on sale after they bought it.
4795112	4797937	I don't feel like Valve should refund me or anything such as life.
4798936	4799956	That's kind of how I feel, too.
4821601	4824103	These deals, this is just how it works.
4824403	4827446	You have to shop around for the best deals, and if you don't, oh well on you, you know?
4828067	4829868	Just cry some more and play that goddamn game.
4830008	4839937	I'll tell you that, I would have been pissed if I'd bought Team Fortress 2 like two weeks ago, but I would have been pissed in the way that somebody who buys Apple products gets pissed every year.
4840197	4844361	Or people who get used to one Adobe Suite.
4845740	4849004	Only to find out that CS6 is coming out in a few months.
4850245	4850946	Fuck you, Adobe.
4851426	4854550	DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, Team Fortress 2 going free?
4854710	4855050	Great.
4855330	4856772	And I also bought the Orange Box.
4856952	4858414	Surprised it didn't go free sooner.
4859555	4865441	I haven't heard a lot of the FPSs or hell even the Valve-owned games going free-to-play.
4865742	4867804	Will Half-Life Episode 3 be free-to-play?
4869508	4875294	Well, for what it's worth, as long as you paid some sort of money in Team Fortress 2, you get perks.
4876215	4878057	You're not leaving us out in the lurch completely.
4878137	4882241	All of this, and Dungeon Buster, it was a TF2 going free.
4882522	4884844	Great, I also bought the Orange Box.
4885325	4886786	I have the Orange Box, I have it on Xbox.
4887247	4887667	Guess what?
4887807	4890430	I like playing it better on my PC, so all this stuff going free?
4890931	4891111	Woo!
4893995	4898218	Also in our chatroom, PenisMan asks, So are we going to form an all-games Team Suck?
4898879	4899740	Sure, works for me.
4900120	4902262	If that name isn't already taken, which it probably is.
4902402	4904164	I'll roll up the group name when I get home.
4904184	4904824	All right, there you go.
4904844	4905465	Team Suck.
4905645	4906125	I could do it.
4906245	4910129	Actually, there is, well, there isn't, to be real, there is an OLR team already out there.
4910189	4910369	Yeah.
4910749	4912971	It's something Dekeman put together a long time ago.
4913031	4915734	So, I mean, there is already an OLR team.
4916134	4920158	And, you know, I'm not saying this in a negative way, but they suck.
4921770	4942966	or at least they will when I start playing on it we don't need your help to suck Rob Blackwolf wants to clarify yeah except Apple will refund you within a certain time frame you know if I had bought Team Fortress 2 two weeks ago which I don't know who did but I wonder if you were to call Valve and complain if maybe they would give a refund who knows
4944289	4945190	DarkSakura.com
4959429	4963051	and find the most obscure fucking game she can to be the game of the week.
4963131	4964892	Which I believe is the case this week, correct?
4965172	4965853	Yes, actually.
4966313	4966853	I will say something.
4966873	4968814	This is a game that I have talked about before.
4969835	4973517	So, it's not really a surprise.
4973617	4975818	It's probably a surprise to people that haven't brought it up already.
4975958	4978440	So, the game of the week is called Emerald Dragon.
4980214	4984355	and importers, PC Engine fans, you will know this one.
4984595	4986056	Lots of dialogue, by the way.
4987916	5000540	The game is an RPG done by Glodia, which they did, they're actually created by Telnet employees, including Tenpei Sato, who was behind Disgaea.
5000800	5004681	So, this game could be, in theory, a precursor to Disgaea.
5005821	5007082	Does it have prinnies?
5009501	5012123	I only played through the first very part of it, Rob.
5012183	5014064	I was like, I can't read that much Japanese.
5014144	5016246	It's a valid question.
5016286	5032677	Anyway, it came out for PC-88 in 1989, and then came to PC-98, X68000, MSX2, FM Towns Computer, and then the console versions were the PC Engine CD and Super Famicom, but they weren't done by Gloria.
5033498	5042798	So there's no versions that are outside of Japan, but you can get a fan translation for the Super Famicom version by Translation Corporation, so look for it if you really want to play it.
5043593	5056562	So basically, it's a big RPG, there was a war in the past, and then lots of battle, and then there were two races that lived on the main continent, and the Emerald Dragon was our champion, and then the Emerald Dragon died and a curse fell over the land, blah blah blah.
5057002	5060705	So now the last dragons are around, and you have to pretty much help them out.
5062946	5071512	You actually find a green-haired girl whose name is Tamarin, which means purity in the ancient dragon language.
5072914	5073395	Ooh.
5073415	5075938	We'll call her Virgin.
5077520	5077901	Virgin.
5079263	5082386	But anyway, she has amnesia, so I won't spoil the game for you.
5083010	5087855	There's also Barsim, Farna, Hathrom, Corsraw, lots of different people.
5087895	5089857	But basically, it's a traditional JRPG.
5090337	5093480	But it has some pretty different combat.
5093500	5097784	It has a large world to look over.
5097904	5102769	But it's one big unified piece, except in the Super Famicom version.
5103069	5105071	Dude, the combat in this looks like Ultima.
5105732	5105892	Yeah.
5105912	5105992	Yeah.
5108246	5112287	It reminds me of Treasure Hunter G, another gem that never made it to the States.
5113648	5121650	The combat looks dead on like Treasure Hunter G. Well, if they came out around the same time, then that could, you know, or by a similar team.
5122530	5124791	One was made by Square, and the other, yeah.
5126191	5127212	Well, at any rate...
5129656	5130317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5147176	5154765	At any rate, with the Super Famicom version of this game, it has a dragon transformation system so Attrition can take on a dragon form.
5156047	5156988	And it's pretty cool.
5157228	5158770	I have the PC Engine version.
5158830	5161453	I have a copy of the PC Engine version of this, I should say.
5161953	5164817	Because the game costs in excess of $300 on eBay.
5165498	5166218	On PC Engine.
5166999	5167280	Yikes.
5167725	5171046	One of my friends has this game, which is how I got my copy.
5172706	5179327	She's also the same one who hooked us up with Dracula X when she owed us $100.
5180587	5187428	Basically, it's standard PC Engine fare as far as the screens.
5187448	5195910	You've got the 16-bit sprites, and then you've got lots of voice acting because, hey, we're doing these games on a CD now, not on HuCards.
5196890	5199552	and all the audio in it is Redbook Audio.
5200213	5203355	So you can actually just pop the CD in your car as long as you skip track two.
5204813	5205013	Nice.
5205733	5212755	So, but that is one of, I think, the gems in any PC Engine collector's archive.
5212775	5219897	Like, if I had to have three games in my PC Engine... Actually, no, I don't have a copy of this one.
5220297	5220857	I have Sapphire.
5220897	5221697	No, I don't have Sapphire.
5222017	5228699	So if I had to have three games that were in the top tier of PC Engine, it would be Dracula X, which I've got.
5230229	5231771	Emerald Dragon, and Sapphire.
5240649	5241389	So this is Emerald Dragon.
5242369	5243850	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5243970	5249871	Very obscure, very hard to find, but very intricate for its time with the voice acting and everything.
5250291	5250891	Emerald Dragon.
5251011	5252651	It actually makes it more playable, too.
5253092	5256192	Because then I at least have somewhat of a clue of what's going on in the game.
5257332	5261513	Yeah, if I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and like... Oh, look, it's Farna.
5262013	5269635	If I could get my hands on Emerald Dragon and not pay like, you know, 300 bucks for it, I would be pretty stoked.
5270816	5273597	Your Classic Game of the Week, Emerald Dragon on the PC Engine.
5274638	5277719	And that's going to bring us to the close of Part A. But don't go anywhere, guys.

5320287	5320748	Orange Lounge Radio
5340509	5346691	We're joined in studio tonight, not only by, of course, my co-host, DarkSakura, Loki, always here with us, but by some special guests.
5347091	5352593	Intern Drew is in the kitchen, but here in studio with us, the lovely Jessica Harper from Understation Live.
5353013	5353153	Hi.
5353273	5353733	How you doing?
5353853	5357955	That's getting birthday spankings later this month for its 10th anniversary show.
5358655	5361316	I mean next month, because we're late June, so next month, I guess.
5361336	5361836	Within a month.
5361896	5362136	Exactly.
5362176	5364537	Basically two weeks from now-ish.
5364717	5365237	Exactly.
5366218	5380338	and we've been spending a lot of the time earlier in the show kind of reminiscing about the good old days of OLR back when we were playing a lot of DDR and so forth and for those that haven't heard the story Jessica and I actually played DDR for the first time together
5380799	5381900	You know you wanna play my head
5403893	5404613	Exactly.
5405174	5409876	And we actually skipped, what was it, Shock Treatment or something on Friday, which is a shitty movie anyway.
5409896	5411496	Yeah, basically we were bored to tears.
5411536	5414538	We just wanted to relax and go have some casino time.
5415018	5415978	We're having our own convention.
5416058	5416278	Yeah.
5416559	5421881	We're like, okay, let's go get drunk across the way over at Quark's Bar.
5422441	5422821	Exactly.
5422861	5427186	Since we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Rocky Horror community anyway, why don't we just go play DDR?
5427226	5427706	Exactly.
5427907	5428327	We had fun.
5428487	5428968	It was a good time.
5429408	5433773	But also that weekend, and I bring this up because this is kind of topical as of recently, but...
5436866	5438147	We went to the Adventure Dome
5458877	5467621	But, you know, we were at the Adventure Dome, and one of the things that they had there, and we spent a little money on, about 20 bucks on, and it was a memory that would haunt me forever.
5468161	5468602	And ever.
5468742	5469162	And ever.
5469362	5469742	And ever.
5469822	5470222	And ever.
5470362	5473664	And you have to keep in mind that this was 11 years ago.
5473944	5474164	Yes.
5474424	5478366	This is even older than Understation Live or Orange Launch Radio.
5478786	5479987	We taped a karaoke video.
5481729	5482029	Oh.
5482369	5482630	Yes.
5483310	5492520	Jessica and I taped a karaoke video, and I seem to remember I let Jess pick the song, and she wanted to do Love Shack, which Jessica's got quite a set of pipes on her.
5492540	5496144	If you've never heard her sing, she's actually quite very good, and she can kind of do that.
5496484	5496925	Love!
5497065	5497806	Love, Shaq!
5521107	5525554	I would go, Funky Little Shaq, Funky Little Shaq.
5525594	5530041	I'm trying to read the words as they highlight, which in the song is, Funky Little Shaq.
5530882	5532204	Yeah, I got the song later.
5534566	5536788	And that actually became our karaoke song.
5537108	5542390	When Rob and I used to go out to karaoke on a fairly regular basis, that was one of our songs that we did together.
5543791	5545172	Other than, what was the other one?
5545232	5545732	Human League.
5546352	5547253	Don't You Want Me Baby.
5548714	5553176	So yeah, we actually did kind of eventually incorporate it into our repertoire.
5554316	5562018	So, but it's interesting because whereas that kind of went to go make an ass out of me, it actually showed off that you can sing, girl.
5562318	5563438	And I know you've seen that.
5563478	5568920	I know one of your other cornerstone songs is What's Going On by Four Non-Blondes or What's Up by Four Non-Blondes.
5570000	5572460	And there was Pat Benatar's song you always used to sing too, right?
5572480	5573140	Hit Me With Your Best Shot.
5573160	5574101	That's right, Hit Me With Your Best Shot.
5574361	5575241	Whip Me With Your Big Cock.
5575521	5578223	Sometimes, depending on how drunk she was, she might get up on stage.
5578243	5579504	I remember a certain occasion.
5579524	5580205	Well, it was a gay bar.
5580585	5583887	I remember a certain occasion, though, at Great America with someone recording Stay.
5583907	5584828	Yeah, that too.
5585749	5592294	And then me doing Like a Prayer, which I foolishly let Travis even touch that CD.
5594115	5594375	Anyhow.
5594415	5603082	You should never, ever, ever let Travis have access to anything that you think might... I seem to remember also a certain Carriac Revolution incident with the two of you.
5603924	5604325	Mm-hmm.
5605047	5607475	And that was when I discovered that this could really belt it out.
5607515	5608940	I was stunned.
5608960	5609040	Yeah.
5609741	5612202	But you're still doing the vocal thing, right?
5612282	5615342	I know we said for years, like, Jess, you should go try out for American Idol.
5615362	5616303	You should go try out for American Idol.
5616503	5618903	Well, now you can't try out for American Idol because... I'm too old.
5619023	5620344	You're too old, as we all are.
5620744	5624585	But there's this new show where age doesn't matter, The Voice, right?
5624705	5625625	And have you been watching the show?
5625645	5626445	You're really into it?
5626605	5628526	I am very, very much into it.
5628866	5633987	I heard about it after the first episode, caught up with it online, and fell in love with it instantly.
5634027	5637628	Because the entire concept of The Voice is that you are just a voice.
5638428	5639309	DarkSakura.com
5654736	5658480	And by the way, yes, this does relate to video games because this show is so huge.
5658560	5661362	There will be a video game based on it in six months.
5661442	5662083	I guarantee it.
5662103	5662523	Oh, I'm sure.
5662664	5664926	I guarantee it.
5665106	5666747	So then now we have a new question.
5666867	5668469	When are you going to try out for The Voice?
5669069	5670531	August 24th in San Francisco.
5671704	5673486	Wow, so you're doing it.
5673807	5674888	I'm actually doing it, yeah.
5675048	5675509	Oh my god.
5675529	5677251	There's a full campaign going right now.
5677812	5682778	I have a Facebook page, which goes by my... Here you go, big moment.
5683138	5688645	On your ninth anniversary show, I'm going to reveal my real last name because... Oh, even I'm not going to do that.
5689946	5705216	Because, unfortunately, there's no other way for me And I couldn't just put myself as Jessica Harper Because I think Jessica Harper would get pretty pissed off So, Jessica Friesen If you go to Facebook.com slash Jess Sings How many S's is that?
5705276	5706397	J-E-S-S?
5706597	5707778	Okay, S-I-N-G-S, okay
5707938	5709819	Rob is not the cunning linguist.
5709839	5712702	So you can go ahead and check out my stuff.
5712722	5713162	I actually have
5726031	5745917	things on there also on ReverbNation.com slash Jessica Friesen that has not only the version of Stay that Jamie had mentioned earlier as well as the video of Rob and I doing that infamous love shack now keep in mind again the video it was from VHS and it is 11 years old
5747018	5748279	Before we had DVD.
5748519	5752222	Yeah, the years have not been nice to the recording, but you still get the hint.
5753023	5758328	And then there's also two recordings in there that are from when I was briefly with the band as well.
5758428	5763433	So vocals, lyrics that were written by me and obviously sung by me.
5764794	5771437	DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind, would you post the link in chat?
5771617	5775618	And chatters, if you wouldn't mind, let's help Jess out with some likes and get her on The Voice.
5776018	5779019	Because then when she wins, we can say it all started here.
5779119	5787963	Yeah, and that ReverbNation page, the ReverbNation.com slash Jessica Friesen, that actually is what I gave to the people at The Voice as my page.
5788223	5788443	Nice.
5788743	5789603	As my music page.
5789723	5794445	So I had to have examples of my music and the more likes that I can get on there, the better off I am.
5794565	5798967	and I'm already up in the 50-ish people now so if I can boost that up a little more.
5799547	5800267	Alright, let's do it.
5800587	5801067	Good luck to you.
5801708	5802708	Let us know how that goes.
5804009	5811491	Sometimes, I don't even know what to expect from those auditions but you know there's going to be thousands of people there so if nothing else, go for the experience and have a blast.
5812712	5813592	That's my whole intention.
5813632	5819014	I don't even expect anything to happen but at least if I get out there and do it I can say that I tried.
5819994	5821595	I at least gave it my best effort.
5821995	5827440	Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, if Jessica makes it big on American Idol, I hope she will remember all those who knew her on OLR.
5827660	5830062	Well, I can guarantee you that won't be happening because she's trying out for The Voice.
5831023	5831824	Wrong show!
5832404	5836508	Anyhow, Salacious Pop has some karaoke requests for Jess and Rob.
5836528	5837129	Oh, really?
5837209	5839210	Yes, some karaoke requests for Jessica and Rob.
5839411	5839811	Let's see here.
5840131	5841793	Close to you by The Carpenters.
5842583	5843785	No, I know what I want.
5844466	5845026	Alone.
5845387	5847029	I actually used to do it.
5847069	5854860	Part of my problem with Alone is that I am no longer the soprano that I used to be, but you catch me with enough alcohol in my system, you might make that happen.
5856535	5883751	Love Will Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille And lastly, Don't Go Breaking My Heart by Elton John and RuPaul You know what, they need to shut up because I have a Captain and Tennille song on my iTunes, thank you, I have Muskrat Love I could possibly get them to take it down a couple of notes If I can get that highest note just a little bit further down Did you happen to watch American Idol when Carly Smithson was on?
5885617	5886958	We'll get back to video games at some point.
5886978	5890501	Because she did Jesus Christ Superstar, but her voice isn't that high.
5891221	5898266	So she actually harmonized, actually did a counter melody part and got away with it.
5899627	5900108	I love it.
5900188	5911416	Our buddy Travis is in chat, or DJ Morpheus is in chat, and in response to the whole Jessica saying we can say it's all started here on OLR, DJ Morpheus says, no she won't.
5911456	5913517	She'll be wearing a USL shirt when she's on TV.
5913557	5914498	If she doesn't, she's fired.
5917442	5922126	And technically, you know, the entire thing did start over there because I did officially announce it over there.
5922326	5922606	I know.
5922666	5923147	Fair enough.
5923167	5923567	Fair enough.
5923647	5926810	But all of you guys, you know, you could still, you know, I'll be all right.
5927130	5929893	I embarrass the shit out of myself with that bitch 11 years ago.
5930033	5930453	Exactly.
5930493	5933195	You just write on 52 to 58 in the last five seconds.
5933315	5933656	Awesome.
5933696	5934176	Thank you, guys.
5935337	5935918	So there you go.
5936238	5937459	It may come in here worth it.
5938960	5939921	No, appreciate having you here.
5940101	5942863	Now if only I could get that kind of response over on USL, you know?
5944124	5946105	Hey, you guys should listen to USL right now.
5946385	5948006	Oh, wait.
5948066	5950108	Now that there's podcasts to listen to, that might happen.
5950148	5950788	I know, go listen.
5951149	5953991	Go start downloading right now.
5955034	5958236	Late breaking news as we get into part B tonight.
5958556	5960016	We're going to get into some video game news.
5960076	5964418	But Loki, you were mentioning some late breaking news just before we went live tonight.
5964438	5965799	And this has to do with music games.
5966079	5967280	This is so big.
5967500	5970982	I don't know how we didn't have it in the show before the news even came out.
5972262	5975364	Ubisoft has announced their next big music franchise.
5976164	5976684	That's right.
5976984	5981087	And you gotta wonder, how the fuck are they gonna follow up Michael Jackson?
5981127	5986430	I mean, Michael Jackson, the king of pop, one of the greatest pop icons.
5987858	5990259	On the anniversary of his death, nonetheless.
6013619	6014660	I can't even say that.
6015441	6020627	That will be coming out to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii soon.
6023871	6024512	Ah, I see.
6024612	6027396	So what would the Black Eyed Peas experience consist of?
6027476	6028918	Just a bunch of shitty sampling?
6028938	6029018	Yeah.
6030521	6039927	I got a feelin' that this game's gonna suck my ballsack I have to repeat this.
6040227	6041187	What?
6041387	6045870	Tiger Claw said the only way to get Jessica back on OLR would be to have us contact her agent.
6046110	6048011	I know, right?
6048372	6054235	Next year it'll be Jessica the experience, but that would be better than the Black Eyed Peas experience, that's for sure.
6054635	6057177	Is anyone excited about the Black Eyed Peas experience?
6057197	6057417	No.
6058032	6059593	I'm sorry, I completely was ignoring all of that.
6059953	6061653	I'm sorry, they're jacking my style.
6063854	6066455	Although I did see the best headline ever.
6066976	6068296	Can I share this with you guys?
6068556	6069897	Hold on, I put it on my Tumblr.
6069917	6073438	I don't talk about my Tumblr a lot because it makes me feel very hipster.
6074239	6076019	But it's my favorite thing that I've posted on Tumblr.
6076039	6076960	Are you drinking PBR?
6077220	6077880	In like a week.
6077920	6079001	I think you're okay then.
6079261	6079801	Here's the picture.
6079821	6081282	It's a headline in a tabloid.
6081682	6086104	It says, Fergie isn't pregnant, just really likes tacos.
6086364	6086724	What?
6090365	6092667	Now that's an experience I can get done with.
6092807	6094149	Rob, I'm reposting that right now.
6094549	6095770	That's what Tumblr's all about.
6095810	6098072	I reposted it from Alan.
6098553	6099113	Let me post that.
6099133	6099574	Can I post that?
6099634	6101315	How do I post that in chat?
6101556	6103457	You just copy... Copy link location.
6103477	6103698	Yeah.
6105149	6105569	There you go.
6106290	6106670	There you go.
6106890	6108211	Hooked on internet worked for him.
6108411	6110092	I think I might have put an extra slash at the end there.
6110132	6110412	Try that.
6111492	6111893	All right.
6115554	6117575	Salacious pop in our chat room.
6117615	6124139	What the hell did... There will be no tumbling during the show.
6124379	6125519	Stop.
6131102	6132183	Will you post that in chat?
6132223	6133804	I officially adore your boyfriend.
6137837	6139098	It's like a little mermaid.
6139198	6142100	It's a little mermaid meets Cyrano.
6142120	6144621	A whole new nose.
6144781	6157729	Well, speaking of salacious pop in our chat room, he's reacting to the Black Eyed Peas experience news saying, OMG, I'm like Regina George when she spit out the Calteen bar and screeched in Mean Girls.
6160635	6160935	Anyhow.
6161996	6163557	Hey, we have spinoff shows.
6163637	6168260	Like, I imagine you love Orange Lounge Radio so much you want to listen to some other shows.
6168300	6170741	I mean, we've plugged the shit out of Under Sedation Live, certainly.
6171121	6174103	But DarkSakura and I do some other shows, too, we want you to know about.
6174143	6174724	DarkSakura?
6175124	6178966	I do a podcast about comics where we don't really talk about comics that much anymore.
6179346	6180227	Because guess what?
6180267	6182108	The comic industry is lame right now.
6183189	6187191	But it's me and Tiara as Marvin Marvel.
6187331	6188512	I almost said Marvin Marvel.

6255736	6265302	Hordehouse.com This week's show, we had our buddy Syl, who is from, she was originally from Amsterdam, but she now lives in Britain.
6265662	6266442	Not the London part.
6266482	6267983	She lives in not London, we call it.
6268443	6272546	And tonight, or not tonight, but this week we got her to talk about ERP.
6273126	6274987	And an ERP story that will shock you.
6275447	6277751	So, yep, we're going to get in all that on Horde House.
6277771	6278453	HordeHouse.com.
6279214	6279655	ERP.
6280516	6280937	It's awesome.
6281257	6281518	Also?
6281939	6282099	What?
6282800	6284523	There will be more stuff coming.
6285465	6285785	More podcasts.
6285805	6286086	More podcasts.
6286761	6288502	You and your crypto stuff, foe.
6289383	6290784	Well, you're in on it.
6290824	6291024	I know.
6291044	6292385	You're helping out.
6292425	6292725	Shit.
6292745	6293626	I disavow all knowledge.
6293766	6296107	Yeah, can we just skip the Dwarven hand cannons, please?
6297508	6301431	And DJ Morpheus, always there to remind me in a who's your daddy kind of way.
6302031	6303833	Rob, Understation Live is not a spinoff.
6303893	6304993	It's your father, bitch.
6305394	6307335	That's why we didn't plug it just then.
6308316	6308536	Oh.
6309917	6311098	He just wants you to get off his lawn.
6312579	6312859	All right.
6313439	6314360	Anyhow, let's move on.
6314420	6315581	Waving his cane at you.
6316499	6317479	Music Games Rock Band
6333967	6358126	and Rock Band getting some new download content in the form of Poison Pack 1 and featuring three songs by Poison including Nothing But A Good Time, Talk Dirty To Me, and Unskinny Bop and that's going to be $2 each or 160 Microsoft points or $5.49 for the whole pack or 440 Microsoft points.
6358286	6359627	Where is my Every Rose Has A Thorn?
6360151	6362072	Sorry, that's not in there.
6362113	6371540	And then also, of course, Three Doors Down, there's going to be a pack for them with the songs Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and When You're Young.
6372400	6376223	Each of those $2 and $5.49 for the whole pack.
6376764	6386451	And then, of course, if that's not exactly your taste, you may check out the Rock Band Network where there's been a pretty neat addition.
6387132	6388953	They added Pac-Man Fever.
6390515	6401360	Among a bunch of other tracks Pac-Man Fever I was going to say, just a really quick side note It's funny you mentioned Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Jamie That was my first slow dance ever Really?
6401380	6404002	In 8th grade But guess what?
6404562	6418589	It's not just Pac-Man Fever Because the Buckner and Garcia's also have Mousetrap, Hyperspace, and Froggy's Lament On the Rock Band Network Each of those two bucks But not doing the Donkey Kong I'm sorry
6421538	6423038	and let's see here.
6423699	6426739	Other than Rock Band, some stuff coming to L.A.
6426799	6428460	Noire or I should say L.A.
6428500	6430640	Noire is coming to PCs this fall.
6431400	6437501	They're going to be doing kind of the Rockstar thing, improving the graphics a little bit and adding 3D support as well.
6438202	6448744	That will be coming out this fall and I guess this fall is when I expect that we can hack the crap out of that because usually it takes the PC version to be able to break it open on both console and PC.
6449524	6449945	7 days!
6464700	6466722	It's 20 days actually earlier this week.
6467703	6485181	So it will be running I guess from now through July 28th and you can check it out on Xbox Live Marketplace or the PlayStation Network and also kind of going with that if you're in the Japanese region or
6485481	6488964	Have a jailbroken phone or device.
6489724	6495368	You can check out the iOS app that's available through the Japanese App Store.
6496109	6503374	And it includes Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 and a minigame called Sonic the Sketch Hog.
6503915	6506837	As well as news feed and weekly wallpaper downloads.
6512885	6513907	I got distracted.
6513967	6515590	Fucking Tumblr, I swear to God.
6515950	6516231	What?
6516872	6519336	No, Tumblr is banned during the show.
6519857	6521259	This is the best one ever, though.
6521860	6523522	Just look at Alan's Tumblr.
6523562	6524764	He posts the craziest shit.
6527591	6530732	Today I will get shit done by visiting LOLNope Tumblr.
6531733	6532873	Alright, moving on.
6533334	6534054	I'll show the chatroom.
6534654	6536375	Hey, this is serious news, you guys.
6537736	6549603	Yu Suzuki has revealed in a Gamasutra interview he is leaving his management position at AM2, which is part of his company that develops games.
6549923	6551984	He will be at Sega as an advisor.
6552664	6555686	But he will be kind of leaving his more management roles.
6555926	6556687	So there you go.
6556847	6557447	Do you see this?
6558908	6560169	Dan and Yu Suzuki.
6561190	6563411	So how does that make you feel as such a Yu Suzuki fan?
6563431	6567254	This was E3 like seven years ago.
6569856	6570736	He looks so young.
6572197	6575259	Are you sad or are you just like, oh, well, you know, these things happen.
6575580	6580063	As long as he's still, as long as his great influence will still be upon Sega.
6580083	6580383	Yeah.
6582358	6583459	Saga will never really die.
6584160	6596815	Well, in more news you can file next to, duh, and of course, PopCap, who, in an unrelated story, has, I guess, rumors going around that somebody wants to buy PopCap for $1 billion.
6596956	6597717	Please don't be Activision.
6599475	6601136	PopCap might be sold for $1 billion.
6601176	6602877	That actually isn't the story I was going to say.
6603778	6607740	Duh, and of course, Bejeweled 3 is coming to consoles.
6607920	6608360	Hey, Rob.
6608660	6608840	What?
6609180	6611662	You know who's rumored to be buying PopCap, right?
6612362	6613022	I heard it was EA.
6613683	6614203	Zynga.
6614823	6615944	Oh, God.
6616704	6617205	Barf.
6618965	6626629	Speaking of Sega and Zynga, I was driving home from San Francisco last night, and as I got on the freeway, I drove by the old Sega building that now has the Zynga logo on it.
6627010	6627710	I cried.
6629448	6634893	Bejeweled 3 on the DS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in the last quarter of 2011.
6635353	6638596	Of course, you know that Bejeweled 3 is coming.
6639377	6642760	And one of these games, you better get it or else it's going to be gone.
6642780	6643901	And this was kind of a big one.
6644041	6644621	TMNT...
6645562	6647505	That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the hipsters
6665806	6674574	But if you want to get Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Reshelled, which was the arcade game but kind of redone graphics and so forth, get it now or never get it.
6674774	6675395	Those are your choices.
6676806	6678787	DarkSakura has got some rapid fire news for us.
6678887	6681668	We'll get to the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
6681868	6685269	Well, this should make a lot of fanboys need new panties.
6686209	6690410	New Dragon Age 2 download content is going to be available.
6690530	6691711	Five achievements.
6691731	6697953	There's actually no price on it quite yet, but the achievements will be for a total of 120 points.
6699193	6724242	That is Conductor, Defeat, and Ancient Evil in the Vimark Mountains Deeproot Safari, Kill, a bunch of stuff Family Legacy, Apply Three Effects to Hawk's Key Family Outing, that's the main quest in Vimark Mountains with Bethany or Carver and the party And Townsweep, you know, actually I got Carver killed and didn't really give a shit about Bethany And Tower Sweeper, where you do every side quest in the Vimark Mountain prison tower
6726361	6734931	Then, there's actually a public monument being made to Gary Gygax, who is one of the creators of D&D.
6735952	6738535	And it is in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
6740057	6741759	It better be a huge mungus D20.
6741899	6746203	And it better be a natural 20.
6747188	6751733	It better be a 12-sider because, dude, it's all about playing Warrior Class.
6752053	6752894	I'm kidding, I played Ages.
6754055	6757659	And last but never least, more WiiU news.
6758380	6759862	WiiU, WiiU, WiiU, WiiU.
6760542	6765808	Every single time somebody says that, I always hear in my head the chick from Kung Pao.
6766809	6767269	Of course.
6768775	6778860	Anyway, Masahiro Sakurai is basically quoted as saying that another Smash Brothers game is years away for Wii U and 3DS.
6779380	6783082	They're putting all of their effort into Kid Icarus Uprising.
6783762	6791086	And he said that it makes him cringe that he's got more projects on his plate.
6791383	6792144	What makes him cringe?
6792184	6795588	The fact that they're announcing games five years before they're coming out?
6795688	6796830	Is that the part that makes him cringe?
6797270	6800854	The fact that he's, I don't know, just putting his credibility on the line?
6801075	6803918	Hey, by the way, we're going to have a new Mario game.
6803958	6806461	Mario's going to come out and be alive in your house.
6806701	6808603	Oh, that's not coming out for 50 years, though.
6809544	6811325	To attract new team members.
6831974	6854408	apparently they need work well there's people over here who don't have jobs who can design pretty well and I'll design your manual for you if you pay me a lot I would think that they would be able to put that up on like I don't know a job posting or something like that instead of saying hey fans of hey guess what fans of Smash Brothers there's a game coming would you rather have someone working on a project that actually cares about the project or someone who's just worried about throwing out crap
6855325	6862492	Well, I would rather they care about it, but also rather they, I don't know, don't announce it before you have even started the game.
6862712	6864794	It's an inevitability anyway.
6864854	6865775	I was about to say the same thing.
6865795	6867176	I was thinking more in the vein of inevitability.
6867356	6872361	New Nintendo console, yeah, of course, we're going to put our new Smash Brothers, but we'll do it later.
6872461	6874643	Hypothetical games that are going to be coming out then.
6874783	6876325	I mean, since they're out there.
6876445	6877526	Microsoft did it too.
6878146	6880869	They announced Alan Wake with the 360 five years later.
6882395	6883816	Okay, but it was probably in development.
6883936	6891361	It wasn't something that they said, eh, well, you know, there's a difference between delay, delay, delay and a difference between...
6892421	6895283	Yeah, well, we haven't really started the game yet.
6896103	6898484	So we wrote it down on a piece of paper.
6898524	6899525	You know we're going to.
6899585	6902286	Hey, wouldn't you guys like a Smash Bros.
6902306	6903467	game on the 3DS?
6904187	6905008	We would too!
6905388	6907289	So that's why we're going to work on one someday.
6910451	6913192	That's what Nintendo was announcing at E3.
6913892	6916134	Shit that they don't even have started yet.
6917486	6920368	They're probably on the drive-in or walking up on the... Hey, you know what?
6920568	6922210	We should tell them that there's a new Smash Bros.
6922250	6922710	coming out.
6923470	6924051	Yeah.
6925752	6927674	Alright, let's get to some Twitter topics.
6927754	6929595	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6930416	6931296	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
6932397	6932797	Every week.
6935290	6936911	We need you here every week just for that part.
6951796	6972644	Who sends us a tweet that's a retweet from Agent M Behold, the 25th anniversary DVD collection of the Golden Girls And we get linked to a post on Yes Tumblr Which is, I guess, this Golden Girls collection that comes in a gigantic purse Awesome It's all seven seasons on DVD with a deck of playing cards as well
6972984	6976186	It better come with a gift certificate to Cheesecake Factory.
6976206	6977867	When's that coming out?
6978307	6978647	Soon?
6978807	6979087	I don't know.
6979108	6979588	I didn't see the date.
6979608	6981229	I would think that Applebee's would be more appropriate.
6981269	6983270	But I loved Flaming Toilet's comment.
6983450	6987292	Now if we could just get them to include an official game in that box set.
6988373	6988813	I'm hoping.
6989534	6993958	And don't forget about maybe having the first season of Golden Palace.
6994759	6995759	Do you remember that?
6996600	6997901	Oh, they linked it to Amazon.
6998021	6998462	Oh, gee.
6998562	7000684	The low, low price of $182.
7001124	7002545	Jeez.
7002605	7003046	Let's see.
7003186	7003486	When is it out?
7003506	7005488	That is still cheaper than Deep Space Nine, for the record.
7005908	7006909	It's out.
7006929	7007349	I don't know.
7007389	7008450	That's a lot of Betty White.
7008570	7009131	It's out now.
7009751	7010212	In stock.
7010912	7011373	Buy it now.
7013200	7014180	It's my birthday, just saying.
7014541	7014761	All right.
7016541	7017142	Moving on.
7017202	7017602	Let's see.
7018042	7020343	Going to S2100 Matt.
7020803	7028387	A guy is shipping himself 2,000 plus miles in a crate while playing Lord of the Rings online.
7028767	7030508	Surprisingly for a good cause, too.
7031448	7033269	This might be relevant to Jessica's interests.
7036174	7040235	We were just talking earlier about shipping Drunami in a crate.
7040295	7040735	There he is.
7040775	7043596	He's in a crate playing on a PC there.
7044497	7046337	That is not comfortable looking.
7047218	7047618	What's his name?
7047638	7050119	Performance artist Jordan Wayne Long.
7050979	7054960	Starting on July 7th, he will be confined to a small wooden box.
7055320	7058161	He's being shipped from Bald Knob, Arkansas.
7058181	7058902	What?
7063460	7064860	And we're back to the penis joke.
7064880	7066121	Ian all alone in that box.
7066161	7068582	He's going to have a bald knob by the time he's done.
7069043	7070603	Well, you know, there's only so much you can do.
7071364	7072845	But it is summer festival.
7074565	7076827	You're going to get bored of Lord of the Rings Online eventually.
7076847	7077987	A man's got needs.
7079208	7081709	Bald knob Arkansas to Portland, Oregon.
7081909	7083730	Picture him finding some cute little elf.
7083870	7084571	Oh, yeah.
7085731	7086251	Oh, yeah.
7087947	7093150	I'm trying to find which port to put his bald nod in Why the fuck is he doing it?
7093690	7107718	The reasons apparently are mixed He wants to provide entertainment through his Twitter account He also aims to better understand post-traumatic stress disorder Many individuals who experience traumatic events What, is this a joke?
7107738	7108659	Are you going to tell me this is a hoax?
7109179	7110339	No, no, it's not a hoax.
7110539	7111540	Here's why he's doing it.
7111560	7115541	Attention whore is why he's doing it because he's a poor artist.
7116061	7121063	I'm doing an art project where I'm going to ship myself in a container and play Lord of the Rings.
7121223	7121643	It worked.
7123344	7131506	How is being in a shipping container while having entertainment and, you know, at least you have one luxury.
7131546	7133567	How is that causing PTSD?
7134642	7135762	and any way, shape, or form.
7136022	7137923	How are you going to have post-traumatic stress disorder?
7137963	7139303	He's playing Lord of the Rings online.
7139783	7144944	If you want to get PTSD, why don't you play Black Eyed Peas, The Experience?
7146944	7147525	I don't get this.
7148665	7157927	I hope they put him in one of those shipping containers up in the airplanes where they have no oxygen and sub-zero freezing temperatures and he freezes to death.
7158027	7160067	That's what I hope happens to this guy.
7160147	7161587	He freezes to death!
7162088	7164128	I wish him death by freezing!
7166238	7167999	Now if that does happen, you're going to feel a little bad.
7168199	7168519	No, I'm not.
7168539	7169220	I'm going to laugh.
7170100	7170701	I'm going to laugh.
7171041	7175243	I'm on the record right now saying I will laugh my ass off for at least five minutes.
7176104	7180086	I hate to break it to you, but I don't think there's any major airports in Bald Knob.
7183388	7184089	If there was.
7184369	7185069	Yes, there is.
7185209	7186570	Bald Knob International.
7187551	7190713	I don't think anybody could ever take it seriously if they had to take a flight through there.
7190733	7192994	They have flights every day to Toronto and Guadalajara.
7193700	7198426	The views expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those of all the staff of Orange Lounge Radio Right
7204139	7208002	No, Frisbee says that can't be more than a four to five hour flight.
7208042	7209743	Dude, he's shipping himself UPS.
7209823	7210664	That's the problem.
7210684	7211945	That's why it's going to take seven days.
7211965	7214446	He's going to get lost, dumped in the ocean, you know.
7214707	7217549	And then they'll leave him on some back porch somewhere.
7217569	7218449	Wait, hold on, hold on.
7218709	7222032	So why is he able to ship himself via, you know, UPS?
7222092	7223513	Because I'm pretty sure they have policies against him.
7223533	7223993	I actually made that up.
7224013	7226535	I don't know how he's shipping himself, but I just assumed it was UPS.
7226595	7227295	Old Dominion.
7227335	7230698	That's what I hope they're shipping him because they will lose that package.
7232651	7238257	Alright, Tigerclaw links us to some stories here real quick Remember Geohot?
7239338	7254114	That's right, the man behind the Sony Playstation debacle when Sony was going to sue him Probably the whole reason why Sony got hacked a couple months ago Apparently, he's come out of this okay He's got a development gig now at Facebook
7254955	7256916	Gameplay Theater Festival Gameplay Theater Festival
7278104	7279945	Speaking of performance art, here we go.
7279985	7282968	It combines gaming and performance art.
7284068	7287151	If you're in Brooklyn, oh God, haven't these guys done this shit before?
7287771	7291414	I remember a Brooklyn theater and something about gaming.
7291714	7293816	But the Brick Theater is going to be doing gameplay.
7293896	7301061	It's a theater festival comprised of gaming-oriented stage productions, musical performances, and interactive performance art.
7301861	7302182	Let's see.
7302722	7322886	There's Romeo and Julietette It's a modern interpretation of Shakespeare's classic It will be performed entirely within World of Warcraft Modal Combat uses real guitars to control Mortal Kombat characters There's a YouTube I could play it Why don't they actually do a good Shakespeare play?
7323499	7327020	Or I could go to the last tweet tonight from Actdeft.
7327540	7328340	Here's a good question.
7328380	7330681	A question for our nine year anniversary show.
7330721	7331241	I like this.
7331941	7337743	What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?
7338603	7342384	What has been the most impacting or surprising gaming news in these nine years?
7342964	7343784	I'll start with Loki.
7344065	7344885	He's opinionated.
7345785	7346505	I don't know.
7348186	7348646	Come back to me.
7348806	7349446	I'll think about this.
7349686	7350226	DarkSakura?
7351146	7352387	Nothing's really surprising.
7352947	7353247	You know
7356221	7359424	It's, anything that's exciting is cyclic.
7359965	7364809	Because there are always, it's always going to be, I read them on E3, all this stuff, blah, blah, blah.
7365089	7366411	And then all of this, blah, blah, blah.
7366731	7368272	So it really is going to go in a cycle.
7368333	7371075	It's nothing stays really crazy.
7371255	7374999	I guess the monumental news of the whole nine years is that I like WoW now.
7377325	7380307	Um, the most impactful news of the past.
7380407	7382869	Well, let me go to the guests first before I say my opinion.
7383109	7383449	Anybody?
7383529	7383969	Do you know me?
7384810	7384990	No?
7385110	7386071	Jess Carper passing?
7386191	7386491	I don't know.
7386971	7387672	Anything you guys can think of?
7387692	7392375	I'm going to go along with Jamie's line of thinking of, oh my goodness, I'm actually playing an MMO.
7393015	7395537	Which for anybody who knows me is pretty shocking.
7395822	7399623	Maybe the advent of the MMO, if you will, over the past nine years.
7399903	7405285	I mean, granted, Ultima Online is a little bit over nine years old, but maybe the mainstreaming of the MMO.
7406105	7409946	It would definitely be in the top five, I think, for me.
7410126	7410806	It really did.
7411106	7416168	And I've said so on the show before, but I've used to play Gemstone back in the day when it was on AOL.
7416968	7419769	And you had to pay to play Gemstone when you had to pay to do AOL by the hour.
7420550	7427277	When I first started into tech support and the whole IT world, I was surrounded by guys who were playing EverQuest.
7427917	7430220	So that was all I ever heard about was EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest.
7430640	7433543	And it was because of them that I swore off any kind of MMO ever.
7434745	7439289	And here I am, many, many, many, many years later, and I'm addicted to Lotro.
7440090	7440731	So, I don't know.
7442965	7459097	for me the most impacting Xbox Live is the biggest story I think that's happened in nine years I don't think people took the Xbox particularly seriously until Xbox Live changed console gaming and not only changed console gaming it killed arcades
7459977	7489137	and it changed the way we commune as a community and it's been imitated by other places I think Xbox Live it's part of the reason we have DarkSakura's favorite word microtransactions now is because of Xbox Live Xbox Live I think is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years I'm still thinking just the whole really pushing the internet too How long do you think it'll actually be before they just give up on the concept of arcades altogether?
7490875	7494478	I don't think they ever will because the ticket gambling things will always be there.
7494678	7497840	And I think there will always be a pinball machine in a bar.
7499822	7508688	At the same time though, just while I was going through Roseville Golf Land, I always make notes when I see new Ticket Redemption games as well.
7509268	7510449	And there were only one or two.
7511310	7513311	It seems like even those are starting to slow down a little bit.
7515012	7517254	However, Pachinko in Japan is still big.
7519644	7522848	The most surprising for me is kind of a tie.
7523769	7526352	I would say the Nintendo Wii.
7526432	7528995	Just the fact that Nintendo did it.
7529816	7534501	They had a vision and they were right and love them or hate them for it, they did it.
7536062	7540025	and the rise of Facebook games I think is very surprising.
7540126	7543468	Farmville might be the most surprising thing of the past nine years.
7543649	7545951	Again, love it or hate it, your grandma's playing it.
7546391	7556360	I have to go with the fact that Nintendo had this neat system that they developed called the Revolution and then last month they thought, hey, you know what's a better name?
7556760	7557120	Wii.
7561524	7562525	And also Giant Enemy Crabs.
7563519	7565001	Some of the chatters disagree with me.
7565041	7567583	I can't see how Xbox Live killed arcade gaming.
7567823	7570206	Because you didn't have to leave the house to go be with other people.
7570406	7571367	That's why I say that.
7571407	7575811	I mean, granted, it's one of several things that probably led to that.
7575931	7578794	But I think it made that whole community gaming.
7578854	7580656	You didn't have to really leave the house to do it.
7580996	7584359	And that goes right hand in hand with the whole internet MMO thing.
7584419	7586822	I think those are closely married together.
7587142	7593205	Just thinking back to the way things used to be, the arcade used to be a place that people would go to hang out.
7594045	7600268	Even before when we were actively playing as a group at Roseville Golf Land and what have you back in the day.
7601108	7607931	Earlier than that, people were... At Birdcage Center, this is a place that we used to have our Rocky at.
7608331	7610333	God, the arcade there was epic.
7610533	7612074	It was one of the best arcades.
7612554	7614175	And it was the thing to do.
7614656	7619980	You would hang out and you would either go to the bowling alley, to the movies, or you would be hanging out in the arcade.
7620660	7622922	And it was the social...
7624493	7651261	basically the social mecca of that entire area so I think that essentially the internet and all of the MMOs, Xbox Live all of that has really really led to the decline I mean it's nice to on a whim go to the arcade with your friends but it's not some place you're going to be spending every single night like we were back in our DDR days it just doesn't happen yeah
7652843	7656785	And again, folks in the chatroom still disagreeing with me over Xbox Live killing arcade games.
7657065	7658305	I'll give you that concession.
7658406	7661287	It didn't single-handedly do it, but I still stand by my answer.
7661367	7663968	Xbox Live's the most important thing that happened in gaming in the past nine years.
7664268	7666449	And again, the Xbox would have failed without it.
7666889	7670611	People did not take the Xbox seriously until you played Halo 2 online for the first time.
7670651	7671051	I mean, there was...
7671871	7696056	of course some people bought the system but it did not take off until Xbox Live I think that really actually started I think from the Dreamcast because a lot more online games for a console came out with the Dreamcast we had Phantasy Star Online in Japan which didn't support their broadband adapter over here which was shitty Quake 3 so many games started coming out toward the end of the Dreamcast life that used the online support
7696636	7723433	But Xbox Live centralized it Exactly, see that's what I'm saying The concept was there Sega was starting to push it Xbox didn't invent it, they just perfected it Microsoft's way of gaming They don't think of it always They just perfect it But in Japan they had the Satellaview for Super Nintendo Where you could play Online games And what was the thing called for the Genesis The X Something
7724494	7724994	Saga Channel
7745478	7747059	Yeah, I think Blackwolf sums it up pretty well.
7747199	7750260	It didn't catch on with the Dreamcast, and it didn't catch on with Sega Channel.
7750280	7751700	I mean, it was a great idea, but it didn't catch on.
7752000	7753421	It needed Microsoft for the marketing.
7754101	7757222	And, you know, that centralization, I think, is, again, the key word there, too.
7757242	7759383	All right, let's move on past the Twitter topics.
7759443	7761363	Let's get into some more gaming news.
7761383	7762444	We have some more stories for you guys.
7762944	7764505	FUs of the Week coming up as well.
7764765	7766265	At some point, we'll have a mailbag, too.
7766965	7770927	And then, of course, the calls, the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7770947	7771487	But not just yet.
7772047	7772928	First some stories, Loki
7794550	7809865	Sony Online Entertainment Platform Engineer claims that Sony technicians only installed firewalls on an ad hoc basis after they determined that a particular user was attempting to gain unauthorized access to the network.
7810605	7826015	and says also that I guess Sony spent lavishly on security measures for its own PlayStation dev network and didn't put the same effort or budget into securing users' data because they only seem to care about themselves.
7828396	7835881	And also I guess that they enacted large-scale layoffs in March of this year just weeks before the massive data breach.
7837372	7843095	Hmm, that's a little coinkydink.
7844596	7848619	Yeah, so there's a whole lot of not nice things that are going on there.
7852581	7853481	I'm making Rob laugh.
7854502	7855963	Tarzira's teaching me sign language.
7856434	7857655	I thought I was going to say Nolan Kerr.
7857775	7859555	Well, what do you think, though?
7861356	7864298	Is this really to blame for why PlayStation Network went down?
7864378	7864678	I don't know.
7864738	7883006	I think just people really want to kick Sony while they're down, and this just seems a little bit like... Well, I mean, if they're spending a lot of money and time to secure their other network that has stuff that's important to Sony, but yet the stuff that's important to their consumers, like, I don't know, their personal information, they just leave wide open, then, yeah, that does sound like a problem to me.
7883530	7886612	I think at the end of the day, you know what I always say on this show, a hacker's going to hack.
7886892	7900902	And I think after everybody was very angered by the removal of Linux, I don't even think if they could have had the higher security facility in the world, they probably still would have found a way to get in there and hack it.
7901422	7901742	I don't know.
7901862	7903203	Not that it makes it right.
7903903	7905565	Sony had every enemy in the world at that point.
7905585	7910508	But then that's also like saying, well, I left my doors unlocked in my house, so that's why I got robbed.
7910888	7911869	Thank you for watching!
7928270	7937097	Put out a bunch of what-if scenarios out there for a whole bunch of things that they could have done, but they didn't do any of them, so we don't really need to.
7937817	7944042	Stupidity in terms of security aside, you still don't blame the victim.
7944823	7948305	You can't say, oh, well, it's just, you know, why secure banks?
7948385	7949887	Bank robbers are going to rob banks.
7950167	7952589	I mean, that's dumb.
7952609	7952689	Yeah.
7954201	7955222	All right, well, let's move on.
7974261	7983928	Well, apparently, there is this whole, I guess, thing going around that there's a better for Kinect, I guess, thing going on with the new Halo game.
7984368	7994735	And Microsoft Studios' Phil Spencer, who's the boss there, mentioned with GameSpot, As a first party, we believe that Kinect will be important to all genres of games.
7995015	7998257	Even games like Halo Anniversary has Kinect integration.
7998678	7999978	So you can say, CONFIRMED!
8000859	8030085	Connect integration with Halo Anniversary but it may not be what you think there was a forum admin BS Angel, I like that name on the Halo Waypoint forums one of the admins said about Halo Anniversary's Connect integration just to let everybody know the Connect features we're exploring with Halo Anniversary are optional and won't affect your core gameplay experience our mission from day one has been to deliver a faithful recreation of the original game and we remain dedicated to seeing that through to completion
8030765	8031326	FaceMapping FaceMapping
8053687	8055428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8075703	8078206	Yeah, but I don't see a Halo map editor happening, period.
8078266	8081810	But it just occurred to me that it would actually be, because you say move tree here.
8081830	8083572	They could do that because of Forge.
8083612	8085915	Remember Forge is part of the region.
8085975	8087236	Or you could just go play Minecraft.
8089144	8090445	I had a nightmare about Minecraft.
8090725	8091906	You had a nightmare about Minecraft?
8091946	8092546	I sure did.
8092626	8095048	Did the goblins get through to your house or any of that stuff?
8095428	8097489	The goblins all had internet troll faces.
8098330	8099150	I'm not even joking.
8099971	8106595	PenisMan in our chatroom says, I don't care if they add connect to Halo as long as I can play it with just a controller as the Halo lover I am.
8107396	8107856	There you go.
8109257	8111619	And BlackWolf says, face mapping under your helmet.
8112239	8115121	Ah, it's technology so good you can't even tell it's there.
8117632	8123593	Anyhow, also real quick about Halo, there is flaming helmets coming to Halo Reach.
8123953	8135455	That's right, if you register on Bungie.net or through the recently released iOS app, you have until the end of July 7th to get a flaming Bungie head-on-fire blue flame thing for Halo Reach.
8135535	8140756	You can get that, and there's this cute little PSA they made about it from, of course, Red vs. Blue.
8141056	8142117	So guess what, Jessica?
8142257	8144037	I can play Halo and be flaming!
8145222	8147407	Hello, I'm flaming.
8147627	8149151	I'm playing Halo.
8150153	8151536	It's fabulous.
8153737	8155298	DarkSakura, you have some news for us?
8156359	8156920	I have mail.
8157841	8158241	I've got news.
8158762	8159462	You have mail.
8160043	8160443	Excuse me.
8160743	8161424	Burn the mail.
8162125	8162365	Okay.
8163266	8164527	We got some birthday wishes in the mailbag.
8165848	8173675	Bit.Trip Saga and Bit.Trip Complete are being done on the 3DS and Wii and will be out on the 13th of September in the US.
8174896	8177759	But there's no European publisher yet.
8178340	8179260	Sadness.
8180061	8182342	We'll have it here, so everybody in Europe, import it.
8204663	8209625	Alright, before we get to some more news... Oh look, it's the Mailbag music!
8209665	8210165	It must be time.
8210185	8212206	Dang it, I almost closed everything, my bad.
8213046	8213807	I don't think so.
8214707	8219809	Every week you guys send us emails, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and sometimes I remember to put it on the show roll.
8220149	8222770	Because this is a show where every gamer has a voice, usually.
8223270	8229453	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I know why you didn't do it, because last week you read it and you thought that I might have laryngitis again this week.
8230592	8231312	Well, guess what?
8231392	8232933	I did it out of consideration for you.
8233173	8236494	Yeah, well, this is from Robba.
8237494	8240635	Here's one of the few stories that link games with less violence and crime.
8240775	8245437	My take on this is, this is just a theory, not scientific study.
8245737	8259642	The only difference is they can compare video game proliferation against the crime rates dropping by year, which is more objective data than the games cause violence wingnuts, which only seem to use hand-picked data from poorly designed experiments.
8260742	8269568	And this actually comes from BBC, which, honestly, world news from BBC is probably one of the best sources to get it from.
8269788	8270829	It's the BBC.
8271089	8274051	Well, keep in mind, you want your dry news, you get it from BBC.
8275112	8278474	Without any of the, you know, sensationalism.
8278594	8281736	Tonight on the BBC, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.
8282057	8284558	But I've covered this on the show before.
8284578	8285319	I think I'm coming.
8285979	8286940	Oh, oh.
8287940	8288381	Oh, dear.
8288661	8289722	Isn't it nice to have a penis?
8291082	8293924	Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?
8294084	8300368	In 19... Okay, it says 1985, crack market recruits youngest sellers, and it's a relatively low rate then.
8300388	8304330	1991, peak murder rate, crack demand starts to fall.
8305150	8305791	And it...
8306811	8316213	It is actually, as of right now, the crime rate is lower for murder, that is, than it was in 1970.
8317693	8320874	It hit its peak in, I think, around 1991, 1992.
8322454	8329736	And that robbery rates are also just slightly higher than murder rates, but still far low what they were in 1970.
8329816	8333176	And that's coming from the FBI.
8333376	8334577	You know what that means, though, Rob.
8334997	8336117	On Wall Street, you're hearing...
8336317	8338038	Silk Crack, Silk Crack, Silk Crack, Silk Crack.
8340138	8341699	I'm posting a link to this in the chat room.
8341959	8356103	But I've covered that on the station before because there was actually someone who did an independent study using a number of different resources including the FBI and various local police accounts that came to the same conclusion.
8356503	8358004	Guess what came out in 1991?
8359104	8361925	The NES, I do believe, in the United States.
8363125	8363185	In 91?
8363225	8364066	No, the Super Nintendo.
8366500	8367120	Super Nintendo.
8368081	8372466	Unfortunately, crack will be on the rise again and it's all thanks to video games.
8372507	8375890	Thanks to a new video game that's going to be coming out this holiday season.
8375930	8377652	It's called Being Bobby Brown.
8377953	8378974	Let's take a look at a clip.
8388988	8390289	I've been to jail before.
8390349	8391269	That's American.
8391729	8392450	Kiss my ass!
8392610	8396511	You kiss my ass?
8396852	8397612	Kiss my ass!
8400413	8401074	Fucking love that.
8401114	8401514	Bobby!
8410339	8413241	Whitney Houston, the experience coming out.
8414021	8415182	Where's my drugs?
8415562	8422106	I'll tell you what, Whitney Houston, the experience would be better than Black Eyed Peas, the experience.
8422186	8422766	I'm sorry.
8423086	8426228	There's something to experience there, that's for sure.
8426618	8437786	Well, anyway, they're attributing some of this to the Obama effect, meaning that they're saying that having a black president is a better role model.
8438147	8439768	Where's my Kurt Cobain experience?
8441109	8443090	And then there's a fall in demand for crack.
8444071	8444832	Be a short game.
8445872	8449175	Obama being president means there's less of a demand for crack.
8449235	8450576	I'm going number by number.
8450596	8451116	Smarter policing.
8456446	8464590	Better tracking of numbers so that they can actually keep the flow of criminality down Increased availability of legal abortion
8466927	8470608	and more criminals behind bars.
8471248	8478910	Reducing of lead in gasoline is decreasing exposure to children, which is also contributing to a fallen violent crime.
8479030	8479990	The baby boomers grew up.
8481150	8481890	Okay, now this is it.
8481930	8482670	This is the important one.
8483010	8489552	Number nine, a study released last month suggested video games were keeping young people off the streets and therefore away from crime.
8490012	8494373	Researchers in Texas working with the Center for European Economic Research said this...
8495273	8502479	and Incapacitation Effect more than offset any direct impact the contents of games may have had in encouraging violent behavior.
8502639	8505722	So what you're saying is then they're just too fat to go outside and kill each other?
8506162	8506502	Pretty much.
8508083	8508484	Too lazy.
8510165	8510425	Nah.
8511406	8514228	It's more of that... I can kill you, but I'm feeling really high.
8515329	8521735	And also, the last one on there, and actually I like this one, the proliferation of camera phones.
8523157	8525604	Meaning, oop, someone's robbing the ATM.
8525705	8526106	Snap.
8528353	8528674	Just saying.
8529389	8530130	Next email.
8531110	8533112	Hey, it's pretty valid.
8534373	8543881	At least it's better supported than all those other... Yet at the same time, the amateur porn market is thriving due to camera phones.
8546223	8547364	Okay, this comes from Holly.
8547964	8550627	Has there been anything on Microsoft's next console?
8550807	8555971	Do you think they are just keeping it under wraps or that maybe they haven't made anything this time around?
8556491	8556932	Under wraps.
8557592	8557832	Maybe.
8558733	8561094	I'd be kind of interested in seeing a portable from Microsoft.
8561194	8563935	With the DS, things have been coming out lately.
8563995	8565515	I'm just not feeling Nintendo anymore.
8566035	8570597	Nintendo seems to be focusing way too much on gimmicky things and way less on quality of games.
8572697	8573137	No, not you.
8573197	8573477	I'm sorry.
8573497	8575138	I'm posing for a picture for Drew.
8577627	8580569	My husband and I both recently got rid of our DS lights and all the games.
8581050	8585934	He had just bought the new Pokemon game but got bored with it after a week since it's pretty much the same game all over again.
8586535	8589097	Actually, we also gave away our Wii to my mom as well.
8589117	8590438	She's using it to watch Netflix.
8590999	8593962	But when our Xbox died, we freaked and ran immediately by another one.
8594042	8596544	It's already red-ringed once, didn't know if they'll cover it a second time.
8598169	8599030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8619725	8623567	Why would you buy an Xbox today with Kinect if you know something better is coming out next year?
8623627	8624927	It just gives people incentive to wait.
8625307	8628829	So I'm going to say that's your number one reason.
8628889	8632090	And it's not, to be honest, that's not specific to Xbox.
8632430	8634951	PlayStation 4 has been in development for years.
8635031	8635752	I guarantee it.
8636192	8639673	You're just not going to hear about it for a little while because they don't want to cannibalize the PlayStation 3.
8640553	8641714	Such is how the game industry works.
8642608	8643829	Good lord, people.
8644349	8644609	Okay.
8645429	8646770	Hey, OLR crew!
8647010	8650712	ACHP here with congratulations and salutations for another year of OLR.
8651052	8657575	I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate your birthday and your roots than an addition of, where are they now, Bay Area DDR players.
8658255	8663498	Fanamei-kun was, a few weeks ago, Milton Maple and Gary, who was Shintenji.
8665660	8671187	Wendell is a trooper and ran Stage Zero day and night to keep folks in the convention center entertained.
8671728	8678097	Speaking of Stage Zero, the DS players, a dance crew formed mostly of old DVR freestylers, took the stage and blew everyone away.
8678577	8681361	No longer satisfied to dance on panels in time...
8682962	8700046	on panels in time to era's likes of AJ Sweet Banana, John Chaos, James Captain Canada, Lawrence Fuzzy Hat, and many more cosplayed as random, completely not anime-related characters like Jesus, Jackie Chan, The Terminator, and Tigger while popping, locking, and breakdancing to the tunes of 8-bit remixes and old-school funk.
8700586	8703687	They put on an amazing show, and they inspire me to become a better dancer.
8704447	8720274	there was still stepping on arrows to be had as Jonas Explicit who's been on the show quite a few times who now runs the Big Anime Game Room or T-Bagger for short at most Bay Area conventions, hosted a DDR freestyle tournament to try and relive the good old days
8720834	8728283	To prove that freestyle is dead, no one cared if you failed or even hit the arrows because no one here remembers how to dance and step on arrows at the same time.
8729264	8729705	Sad face.
8730105	8733789	Bruce Leroy showed up and brought it back old school, but Chaos One was some excellent locking.
8734530	8740818	Mel B and Rain provided some sweet tunes at the Faname Rave and were the only two DJs who played music that anyone can dance to.
8741398	8748466	I won't get into how I feel about anime con rave music here, but suffice to say that Mel B and Rain are following their passion of music.
8748607	8754854	By the way, if you're really lost right now, these are all people that were very much like win, place, and show in the DDR tournaments of our day.
8754954	8757597	So if you didn't follow that scene, you're a little lost right now.
8757617	8761041	And I'm pretty sure that Hattori Hanzo was also part of the rave crew as well.
8761792	8761972	Yes.
8762653	8766298	But, I want to say, for those that were, this is a great email.
8767459	8770083	Let's lose people further with a resounding, Hi guys!
8770663	8771064	Shut up.
8771304	8775169	I'm actually totally... I wanted to go to Faname this year, but it didn't work out.
8775209	8776271	I'm going to Faname next year.
8776291	8776611	I don't care.
8778152	8784615	Finally, at Kentucky Con in Sacramento last weekend, I ran into Lil B, who showed up for a dance competition to win a $1,000 grand prize.
8785176	8788657	For those who don't know, Lil B started dancing seriously around four or five years ago.
8789117	8793799	From what I can hear from his sister, he dances all day and all night and wins dance competitions all over the Bay Area.
8794300	8799042	There was some fierce competition at Kentucky Con, but Lil B came out on top to claim the grand prize.
8799502	8805445	That man is still like five feet tall, but now he has transformed into a compact ball of pure energy that exists only to dance and win.
8806625	8811469	Also, I went to Svigel for the first time in about five years, and Corey Virtue was still there playing 2DX.
8811949	8813790	It's nice to know that some things never change in life.
8815652	8815992	Zing.
8816132	8817373	Except he's married now.
8817453	8818173	Can you believe that?
8819194	8824178	Didn't he, like, just walk by you randomly one day and go douche or something?
8825418	8827060	Uh, no, I think that was the other douche.
8827260	8827920	I don't know.
8828280	8830982	Or somebody else did that, and I was like, what?
8831743	8833724	Let's talk about happier subjects.
8833884	8836066	But he did the bag of flour.
8837483	8838205	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
8845325	8847567	Anyway, my brain, okay.
8848427	8849929	It's nice to know some things never change in life.
8850069	8852931	I hope you all enjoyed my edition of Where Are They Now?
8853371	8858015	The prevailing theme is that the freestylers are still dancing just without the aid of arrows and a dance pad.
8858375	8861858	Definitely check out the DS players on YouTube and we'll be locking as well.
8862378	8868243	The way I see it, if a bunch of anime nerds who liked a dancing video game become one of the best crews in the Bay Area, anyone can learn to dance.
8868723	8870204	Happy birthday, OLR, and I love you all.
8870224	8871045	Yours truly, AZHP.
8872338	8872818	Great email.
8873179	8873419	Yes.
8873779	8875581	Worth... For like 5% of the audience.
8875601	8876402	I need some lighter.
8876462	8878443	Awesome email.
8878463	8879664	For everybody in this room.
8879825	8880605	Yes, exactly.
8881766	8882307	Memories.
8882767	8882987	Okay.
8883588	8884108	Hi, all.
8884729	8885029	Hi.
8885249	8885550	Hi.
8886070	8886390	Hi.
8886430	8890274	First off, I want to thank you guys for giving me so many tips for a horror point and click game.
8890674	8892296	I started with Amnesia, The Dark Descent.
8892356	8893817	I've never been so scared in my life.
8894217	8898341	When my husband, who stood right behind me, said something to me, I shrieked and almost punched him in his manly hood.
8899722	8900783	I have two questions for all of you.
8900803	8901323	I'm going to dry.
8915695	8919339	Since I'm an MMO addict, what do you think of the upcoming MMO The Secret World?
8919919	8922441	I am hoping it will be really good, Hork, Cthulhu, etc.
8922942	8926445	But I do fear that it might not be as good in the end as I want it to be.
8926825	8928407	A bit why I got with Conan.
8928707	8932911	My second question, in these nine years of podcasting, what have you guys learned about yourselves in podcasting?
8932951	8934452	Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?
8934853	8935874	Lots of love, Syl.
8936354	8936654	P.S.
8936754	8939337	I'm still going to Ninja Dark Sakura for an interview on Girls Gone Wild.
8940639	8941319	I'm down for it.
8941399	8943560	Those are two completely different questions.
8943880	8951781	The Secret World, I don't know much about it, but I'm doing a little bit of reading on it, and it sounds like it's the folks that made Age of Conan, so it ties into that, and Anarchy Online.
8952001	8957082	It's being made for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, and there's no levels, no classes.
8957202	8965684	It's all skill-based, so you don't have to level grind, and I guess there's several side quests and all that type of stuff you know on MMO.
8966284	8967426	I don't know much about this game.
8968667	8972171	I don't think they showed it at E3 this year, or if they did, it was a little bit under the radar.
8972532	8974374	So I don't know enough about it to really comment on it.
8974394	8975835	I want a Total Call of Cthulhu MMO.
8976616	8980241	I hope it's better than the Conan MMOs.
8980341	8982603	Drew just said what I was thinking.
8982643	8984465	It's like, were you never going to get a character past level 5?
8986202	8987042	What was the second question?
8987062	8989424	The second question was something about podcasting itself, right?
8989524	8991686	What have you guys learned about yourselves and podcasting?
8991806	8993228	Do you have any tips for the rookies out there?
8993388	8993908	Oh, God.
8994589	8997591	I've learned that I have a high tolerance for bullshit now.
8998112	8998532	Not really.
8998632	9000394	I don't have a high tolerance for bullshit.
9001154	9008956	That's kind of a wide question considering how much the whole process of quote-unquote podcasting has changed over the last nine years as well.
9008976	9009356	That's true.
9009476	9011097	There was no podcasting when OLR started.
9011117	9012697	Yeah, there was no such thing as a podcast.
9013217	9016658	There was just broadcasting on Live 365 and boom, there you go.
9016718	9017839	Shoutcast server galore.
9018259	9022540	I will tell you one big thing that I've learned just from being a quote, public figure.
9023200	9026041	Because we get emails from complete strangers.
9026161	9026301	Mm-hmm.
9026841	9054340	That, when someone is saying that you need to go back to the kitchen And that you're bringing down the podcast It's sort of like, well they don't know shit about me I don't care, it was that point I was like, I don't really care, you know I can take whatever comes my way I've got a lot of people supporting me And really, those are the people that I'm doing this for Yeah, haters gonna hate Exactly, that was the big thing, haters gonna hate
9054820	9074334	and uh you know for every troll out there there's look look at the chat room people that are spending their sunday nights listening to some schmoes on the internet they could be in church i mean it's just that's that's why to be here but let me give you the number one piece of advice i could i could do a podcast on podcasting but let me let me give you the number one piece of advice
9075715	9075895	I quit.
9075915	9076016	Yeah.
9096676	9100978	But they were 12 people that were giving up their Sunday nights to come listen to what we had to say.
9101158	9106540	And it was like hanging out with your friends at dinner at Brookfields, Denny's, whatever the place is.
9106740	9108741	Some of us still podcast to 12 people.
9108981	9109881	Exactly.
9109921	9111022	But we love it.
9111222	9112242	And that's the whole purpose.
9112302	9117184	Because those are 12 badass people that you're having fun with.
9117684	9125067	So podcast because you like that sense of community no matter how big your community is.
9125347	9126188	I've made a lot of friends.
9127410	9127971	All over the world.
9129193	9129954	And they've sent us this.
9129994	9130595	You got porn.
9132077	9132879	It's in that box.
9132979	9135262	Do podcasting to get porn.
9135302	9138948	There's actually not that box, but that box over there still has some of the stuff.
9140851	9157112	uh and then uh the the honestly as far as like the actual production of a podcast quote unquote my my big thing be enthusiastic be and you don't have to be like oh my god you guys i'm so excited about games no like just be sound like you want to be doing a podcast what's that
9157572	9174819	Fabulous But no, for real, like, just I can't tell you how many podcasts I've heard where it's like Okay, so, welcome to episode number It's like listening to NPR Episode number five of GameCasts and we're gonna talk about video games Would you like fries with that?
9176059	9179781	You know, it's just like sound reasonably happy.
9180222	9187506	And I realize sometimes we're very harsh critics about video games here on the show, especially that guy sitting over there when it comes to Nintendo.
9187826	9188666	But don't mistake.
9188707	9189807	Don't talk to Drew like that.
9189867	9192229	Don't mistake enthusiasm.
9192249	9192749	Fuck you, buddy.
9193769	9196911	A lot of that is when I say enthusiasm, a lot of that is really passion.
9197632	9199613	Have a passion for what it is you're talking about.
9201207	9202688	Even if you're talking about nothing.
9202768	9204128	Or talking out your ass.
9205048	9208189	We rant and we rave because we actually give a damn.
9208669	9209510	Talking out of my ass?
9209530	9210350	What are you talking about?
9210530	9216652	And don't do what I used to do every few years and do nothing but read Harry Potter books during the podcast.
9217192	9221313	SST100 Matt in chat says, I don't even remember what I did on Sunday nights before OLR.
9221613	9223054	That's how long I've been listening to OLR.
9223134	9223774	Seven or eight years.
9223874	9224774	I remember what I did.
9224974	9225615	I slept.
9226275	9229876	I used to go to the goth club with Jessica.
9230888	9232888	Yeah, that's why I was never around on Sundays.
9234609	9235289	Funny enough.
9235609	9237209	Ironically, that goth club sucks now.
9237950	9238270	I know.
9238870	9243311	Well, I was just thinking about that two weeks ago because I heard about it in passing or something.
9243331	9246432	And I was just like, God, I haven't been there in nine years.
9246872	9247952	Yeah, it's still going.
9249152	9249992	But it sucks now.
9250953	9251853	It's all teeny boppers.
9252373	9252853	Baby bats.
9253413	9253713	Yeah.
9254393	9255334	Completely batlings.
9256114	9256994	I'm more goth than you.
9258807	9261029	Either that or I'll wear less clothing than you.
9261069	9263530	Did I tell you about me going to Bat's Day at Disneyland?
9265151	9265852	It was sad.
9266632	9271736	It was a bunch of little Hot Topic baby goths.
9271756	9280282	Except for this one chick who was wearing full black Victorian garb with the bustle and everything, pushing her baby in a lace-covered pram.
9281900	9283201	It was the most adorable thing.
9283221	9285743	I was like, okay, you're doing actual gothic.
9286303	9286543	Yeah.
9287124	9294669	I'm catching up on some of the chat comments from chat.orangelonsradio.com because I was busy chatting about that last email and I'm catching up with your chats.
9295129	9298011	And I want to say this and then we can maybe go on to the next email.
9298631	9300813	I love this comment from Dark Tetsuya in the chat room.
9301193	9304195	This is about the haters going to hate line that DarkSakura was talking about.
9304715	9305336	Yeah, really.
9305716	9308978	You've been doing the radio podcast thing for nine years.
9309338	9311660	What have they done with themselves in that time?
9312816	9314197	They just right on dig.
9315238	9315558	You know?
9316439	9317900	And that was the whole thing.
9317940	9324845	The moment that I saw the sort of misogynistic comments, I was like, it has nothing to do with any type of talent or anything that I said.
9325205	9328127	They're gonna be little, you know, dickless, you know...
9330376	9347511	Dickless Wonder Next email Okay, I'm actually replying to Syl I'm sending her my email Oh, Syl was the guest on Horde House and she was fabulous I'll reply to it later, but I'm sending Syl my regular email Oh, you girls gonna chat offline about pillow fights?
9348011	9351214	No, about me being on Girls Gone Wild Oh, okay, it's a fun show
9352403	9354485	She wants to go wild on Girls Gone Wild.
9355166	9357608	I'll ask you to take your top off.
9357828	9363193	For the record, for the record, my tune has already danced mostly naked in front of the Lich King.
9364926	9366768	Keep your ass out of Goldshire.
9367029	9370934	There's pictures of my team dancing naked in front of the Lich King.
9371014	9374078	Before you go on Girls Gone Wild, I need you to do some research.
9374138	9379245	I want you to roll a character on the Moonguard server, take off all your clothes, and run to Goldshire.
9380747	9382570	Just watch.
9383598	9385459	See, now you're giving me ideas.
9387340	9392603	Rob, you realize that when we get back from Pinkberry, that's the first thing I'm fucking doing.
9392663	9397385	I'll run straight from Archet to Bree, all the way to the Shire, completely naked.
9397585	9398166	Just saying.
9398366	9400487	Goddammit, guys, Moonguard used to be good.
9400587	9406070	Well, technically, they, um, they, uh, well, shoot, I'd have to get to Stormwind.
9406290	9407611	Is it from Stormwind to Goldshire?
9407791	9408631	Elwynn to Goldshire.
9408751	9410172	Elwynn to Goldshire?
9410592	9410752	Yep.
9410812	9411353	That's real human.
9412453	9412953	Next email.
9412973	9413274	Naked.
9413394	9414094	Oh, God.
9415315	9415535	Okay.
9415895	9417816	Dear OLR, I have nothing intelligent to say.
9417876	9418476	Okay, bye email.
9418536	9418716	Okay.
9419097	9423199	But as a long-time listener, I would like to wish you all a happy birthday and thank you for your dedication.
9423659	9426620	Running for almost a decade is an incredible achievement.
9426941	9432603	Sometimes I wonder how much an effect your show has had on me as I've grown up, considering I've been listening since I was 14 or so.
9433224	9435525	It's been a positive one, though.
9435825	9436886	I'm glad you think so.
9436986	9438287	I wonder what your parents think.
9439228	9444872	Please continue to do your show until the universe collapses in on itself or until at least the sun goes large enough to swallow the earth.
9445452	9446553	Elliot, the Afro guy.
9446973	9447474	Oh, God.
9449055	9449875	There's been a few people.
9449915	9451537	There was an iTunes review recently.
9452097	9453998	By the way, we love five-star reviews on iTunes.
9454038	9459202	And I gotta say, one of the most recent ones that's there is somebody that was literally saying, I grew up on your show.
9459903	9460843	And like, I...
9461764	9464666	I really can't wrap my head around that comment.
9464806	9468849	Like, I know it's a compliment and I'm very thankful about it, but I literally can't.
9469289	9469590	Rob.
9470010	9470250	What?
9471231	9473252	You grew up on this show.
9475294	9476715	No, think about it, okay?
9477235	9483379	When you first started, when we first went off back in 2000 to the Rocky Horror Convention, you were what, 22?
9483419	9483539	Mm-hmm.
9485413	9489496	Yeah, I still don't think you, sir, have grown up on this show.
9490097	9490557	It's true.
9490717	9496022	I can agree that for myself, because honestly, when you're in your 20s, you're still sort of in that teenage drama.
9497002	9498944	It's why I can't listen to the old episodes of OIL.
9499204	9501246	Everybody always asks, like, when are you going to post episode one?
9501306	9502847	It's not that I'm embarrassed of episode one.
9502927	9503768	I love episode one.
9503948	9504949	That's just not you anymore.
9505129	9506750	If I listen to it, I go...
9508086	9511748	That guy then, I want to punch him.
9513789	9514449	In the face.
9515350	9518291	You know, I feel the same way going back on my life journal.
9518351	9518931	Seriously.
9520032	9523453	You want clear-cut evidence how much I've grown.
9523994	9525294	Mr. Young Republican.
9525855	9526295	Seriously.
9527595	9529276	At least he's more of a young libertarian now.
9529316	9530657	At one point, this guy had hair longer than mine.
9530717	9530957	I got lazy.
9537597	9538417	It actually looks good on you.
9538758	9539958	I'm due for another haircut anyway.
9540719	9549504	But anyway, I think I can say safely that ever since all of this started, because I'll even go back to USL.
9550004	9553566	Because that's where I got, my start was guesting on USL a whole bunch too.
9553586	9554066	Oh, sure.
9554206	9563791	I mean, USL kind of, I will say, for all the shit I've given Travis over the years and all this, and he says, you know, sometimes I refuse to acknowledge the show or whatever, which, you know, isn't true.
9564072	9566453	I love Under Station Live, but let me say this about Under Station Live.
9568536	9571957	As Drew ceremoniously passes the mic back over to me.
9573338	9576659	It showed me that there is an audience.
9578079	9579499	There's an audience for tickling guys.
9579519	9580540	What the hell are you talking about?
9583461	9585261	Forgot about that one, didn't you, sir?
9585341	9589402	It definitely was the enabler because KCSC was one thing.
9589763	9592643	That was about trying to get into... I still have pictures from that, by the way.
9592703	9594984	That's when I thought I would be a radio DJ.
9595024	9596045	That would be my gig.
9596105	9597305	That was going to be my life.
9597745	9601327	was, you know, Waking Up With Rob on 97.7.
9601447	9604829	This right here is more reasons why you should listen from time to time.
9605530	9610813	Because we even went so far back as Travis found the video from when we were on the news.
9611453	9611834	Oh, God.
9612374	9613975	When we were interviewed by Christina Warner.
9615716	9618878	Because we were doing this thing that was so unique that was...
9619298	9620959	Never Heard Of in Sacramento.
9621039	9622300	It was such a unique thing.
9622361	9625283	And now, you know, everybody and their dog has a podcast.
9625703	9625883	Yeah.
9626023	9627925	But we were doing it way back when.
9627965	9629106	You know what it makes me think of?
9630867	9631848	Oh, it's so much fun.
9634050	9636892	By the way, that was the greatest moment in nine years of Orange Lounge Radio.
9636952	9640074	I will say it was that, oh, it's so much fun.
9640214	9643757	One of my favorite movies is a lot of our old school listeners know is Pump Up the Volume.
9645058	9647480	I still think we have a better audience than any kind of tickling guys ever could get.
9647520	9647540	I...
9671477	9673179	I will also say this about Interest Nation Live.
9673279	9680505	The episode where we randomly called the Bunny Ranch and ended up talking to dude for like two hours.
9680565	9682947	Dennis Hopp was trying to get me to go there for free.
9683708	9692135	Was possibly easily one of the top, maybe the top thing that has ever happened on internet radio for me.
9692215	9694016	You know what one of my favorites was on USL?
9694437	9696278	Calling Disneyland when there were phones in the park.
9698420	9707125	and then the Disney... We've actually been trying that recently but it's so hard to find a live phone line in Disneyland anymore.
9709627	9710908	Don't forget when we called Iraq.
9711488	9713029	Yes.
9713049	9716991	We called a hotel in Iraq and we tried to book a hotel room for George Bush.
9717672	9718812	We're coming to get you.
9719152	9719953	That was terrible.
9722574	9724215	Hey, whose birthday show is this?
9724936	9726277	Okay, last email.
9727208	9754817	all caps Bobby wishes or happy 9th birthday with a birthday taco tacos all caps Bobby he's not pregnant he just really likes tacos that's how you have to read all caps Bobby I'll save the Bobby comments for his show I always read Bobby's emails last he's got a 6 year anniversary and 300 episodes he's having a sexiversary thank you Bobby but now I think I'm all lowercase alright
9757214	9757914	Is that it for emails?
9759335	9759635	Yarp.
9760375	9760955	Thank God.
9761015	9761415	Narp.
9761455	9764696	Nailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Narp.
9765757	9770718	Loki, some gaming news amongst all this talk of the Bunny Wrench.
9771659	9772079	All right.
9773179	9778081	Yes, unfortunately, no Bunny Wrench games to transition into that, but we can talk a little bit about Bungie.
9778521	9785143	Bungie's doing the kind of anniversary of Halo thing right now, or I guess anniversary of Bungie.
9785163	9785843	20 years of Bungie.
9786643	9807959	and, um, with that, uh, a guy by the name of, uh, Daniel Bleszek, he's been working on an iPad port of, um, Marathon, and I guess, uh, basically now it's almost ready to go, and it's pending, um, Apple's approval right now for the low, low price of zero dollars, and, um...
9808779	9816826	If that isn't enough, apparently they're also releasing the final game of the Marathon Trilogy Infinity to the open source community.
9817847	9823292	So maybe that will also come to the iPad since it will be open source and someone can port it over.
9825113	9825493	Pretty awesome.
9827015	9827335	All right.
9828756	9830838	And then let's see.
9832386	9833287	Yeah, that's it for now.
9833708	9836891	Alright, let's move on to a story about Silent Hill Downpour.
9837092	9845942	Well, guess what Silent Hill Downpour, or as some are calling it, Silent Hill Alan Wake, Silent Hill Downpour will not have Pyramid Head.
9847084	9848345	Aww, you guys know Pyramid Head.
9848385	9849887	And it will not be good either.
9851208	9854329	Unfortunately, some of the people that played at E3, I'm not hearing a whole lot of it.
9854389	9857031	But it will have 100% more corn in it.
9857211	9863253	It will have guns, and they're saying they're treating the gun like the gun in The Road by Cormac McCarthy.
9864834	9868595	There is a gun, but there are only three bullets, so how will you use them?
9869616	9869796	Hmm.
9870339	9872100	Well, that was kind of always what Silent Hill was about.
9872120	9877042	It was never about confronting things head on, but about, you know, what do you run from and what do you take on?
9877062	9881384	And I don't know if that's, that doesn't sound like a totally new concept to me, but whatever.
9883504	9884865	Let the shroomy go.
9884885	9890888	Yeah, so there won't be Pyramid Head, but there supposedly will be some other scary people.
9891328	9891608	Whoopie.
9893752	9894613	Alright, DarkSakura.
9894633	9896075	Shermie has left the room.
9896395	9897256	DarkSakura.
9897737	9899759	You have to make, you know, a nice wide path for Shermie.
9900520	9902382	So she can... Waddle on through.
9902602	9903723	Yeah, poor baby.
9903964	9910271	Okay, so Valve likes the Wii U. Ooh, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U. Confirmed, Valve likes Wii.
9910351	9912133	Wii U, Wii U.
9915248	9932158	Gabe Newell said at New York's Games for Change Festival that they like the Nintendo Wii U and he's quoted as saying Wii U seems to be a lot more powerful than the previous generation.
9932198	9941504	It sort of fits better into the scalability in terms of graphics performance and CPU performance so I think it'll be a lot easier for us to fit into our scalability model.
9941884	9943064	We've always loved Nintendo.
9944165	9953071	So, they're saying that they are still looking into different console counterparts, starting with the 360 and recently moving to the PS3.
9955232	9958754	They're saying that the Wii U is going to be scalable.
9960235	9964238	Maybe in Portal 3, you can be GLaDOS with that whole little screen thing.
9964258	9967860	Where all you control is the camera angle in the little room.
9968140	9968941	Now you're the troll.
9970037	9973659	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9974260	9992331	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
9992631	9996713	FU to the remnants of my sinus infection deciding to move into my lungs.
9996974	9997354	Evicted!
10002679	10004576	F you to having a headache.
10008448	10031505	F you to the fact that I see a lot of things at pride festivals that make me not have a lot of pride and I'm talking about just drunk bitches that just go to get drunk and take their top off like it's just I I can't stand like it's like a frat party some of that shit that I see going on in the streets and it's just it's just dumb I don't know it doesn't make me happy
10032845	10033846	You want to show your pride?
10033966	10035026	Protest something.
10035786	10036767	That's how it all started.
10038607	10041929	Jessica Harper, any FUs of the week you want to get out?
10043069	10046631	FU to judgmental types.
10049932	10050412	And Drunami.
10052529	10078403	a few to completely sucking any sort of a sales job lost my job, oh well and a few to scheduling conflicts and not being able to seem to be able to get money for all these great games and other essential shit I need to get done at least a lot of them are going free to play that's the silver lining alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys Loki, got one more for us?
10078843	10087306	Yes, you know, as if ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace weren't annoying enough, they're going to now support Kinect.
10087786	10088306	Awesome.
10088486	10101850	So you spend $150 for the Kinect camera and you get to do wonderful things with your ads, including getting them to retweet bullshit onto your Twitter account.
10102270	10108036	By the way, anybody that retweets bullshit from the Xbox Live Marketplace is going to get unfollowed.
10108416	10109217	Thank you very much.
10110698	10117484	You can say, Xbox, tweet to let people know that you love Coke and not the good kind of Coke.
10118265	10122689	Or like, for example, you know, there may be a trailer for, you know, a movie or something.
10122769	10123991	You can go, Xbox, near.
10124551	10137864	and it'll show you the nearest retailer for whatever or Xbox schedule for watching a TV show or some bullshit like that.
10140106	10140767	It just sounds dumb.
10144976	10146478	One more story for you guys.
10146518	10148120	This story made Jessica Harper cry.
10150442	10151964	It's making me sad.
10153226	10157831	Go figure it's going to involve Billy Mitchell in a roundabout way making Jessica Harper cry.
10158371	10178026	And of course, Billy Mitchell was in a movie called The King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters Alright, it doesn't have to do directly with Billy Mitchell But the director of King of Kong, A Fistful of Quarters Which was, what's his name, Seth Gordon He was the director of this movie He's apparently making a reboot of the movie War Games Boo!
10178767	10186393	That's right, the 1983 movie starring Matthew Broderick About hackers Let's play Global Thermonuclear War
10187334	10188975	There was even a ColecoVision game in 83.
10191097	10193599	Apparently he wants to reboot the movie War Games.
10193659	10196201	Why does this piss you off, Jessica Harper, if I need to ask?
10197623	10202947	Because I'm getting really freaking tired that nobody can come up with a unique idea anymore.
10203448	10204709	So hey, let's redo this.
10204789	10205750	Hey, let's redo that.
10206591	10207872	Oh wait, Logan's Run.
10207912	10209473	Yeah, that's been in production for how long now?
10209974	10212316	Oh yeah, let's redo Pretty in Pink and...
10212856	10213596	or the trailer.
10213756	10216077	I saw a trailer the other day for Footloose.
10216597	10218237	And I was like, what?
10219738	10220318	Why?
10220678	10231320	I completely understand that I know that I'm probably towards the end of the Gen Xer group because I think 77 was about the end.
10232021	10233381	But at the same time,
10233801	10234642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10247958	10248438	Stop it!
10249359	10249979	Stop it now!
10251800	10252280	You know what?
10252941	10256043	For a while, if you look at it though, they were copying a lot of Japanese movies.
10257203	10258364	Especially in the horror genre.
10259124	10260805	And then they started rebooting the horror movies.
10260825	10266368	Now they're rebooting... It's because everybody... It's like they don't have any unique ideas anymore.
10266548	10269470	It's too hard for them to come up with something that is different.
10269590	10272752	It's like if you want to get something good and different, you're just going to have to go to the indie market.
10272952	10273212	DarkSakura.com
10292746	10293426	It's acceptable.
10293486	10294327	It's acceptable.
10294687	10299128	And it's like bros get together and drink beer and watch My Little Pony.
10299248	10299869	Two words.
10300129	10300789	Periphery.
10301129	10301729	Demographic.
10302209	10304970	For the same reason that guys would like Powerpuff Girls.
10305010	10309152	Which was also freaking awesome, but I didn't buy into the whole brony crap.
10309172	10310092	Just like poker face.
10310152	10310672	You know what?
10311693	10311773	My...
10313053	10316794	When you said that, I started thinking of those little homies figures that you get out of the quarter machine.
10316815	10317775	No, it's nothing like that.
10317795	10319496	Mixed with a pony.
10319516	10323157	You remember Secret of the Magic Crystal with the pink anus and everything?
10323217	10323817	I have that game.
10324457	10328739	Imagine getting really high and or drunk and playing that game with your bros.
10328839	10331120	That's what the My Little Brony phenomenon is all about.
10331560	10334041	I'm going to love and tolerate the fuck out of you.
10335723	10336543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10362785	10363445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10386183	10394135	you know what's actually kind of funny my wife is terribly excited about the reboot of The Bodyguard with Rihanna
10395916	10397817	Because the first movie was so great.
10397957	10398637	She loves it.
10398817	10399337	She loves it.
10399417	10400298	It's a terrible movie.
10400418	10401318	But she loves the movie.
10401378	10403739	And she's going to love the body art because it's a terrible movie.
10403899	10407101	Because Whitney Houston cannot act at all.
10407421	10408301	She is terrible.
10408461	10408861	Period.
10409902	10410382	Alright, look.

10428132	10429673	I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
10429853	10433455	Rob, by the way, said this while we were in the car coming back from Disneyland.
10433556	10433776	What?
10434296	10446945	The whole... No, when Bobby was talking about... Not Bobby, it was Peter was talking about hanging out with us was like listening to an episode of OLR and he broke into the phone line spiel.
10448823	10449363	I was like, that's it.
10449443	10451444	Actually, you do say it exactly the same way every week.

10461609	10462109	Barbara.
10462349	10464771	Mormon Tabernacle Choir is neither Mormon nor Tabernacle.
10465731	10466291	Discuss.
10467612	10468452	Talk amongst yourselves.
10471514	10471774	Well.
10472481	10473561	I'm feeling verklempt.
10473922	10475122	No calls.
10475242	10475702	It takes a minute.
10475722	10477123	We got like that minute buffer thing going on.
10477163	10478423	What's wrong with you people?
10478884	10480064	They haven't heard the number yet.
10480164	10485666	They don't think the Skype line doesn't... And here I complain about our five second buffer over on USL.
10485706	10489168	They think we're bitching about my little bronies or whatever still going on.
10489568	10491729	So let's go to the Skype line and see who's there.
10491749	10492709	See, now the calls are coming in.
10492969	10493950	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
10493970	10494290	Who's this?
10495518	10495838	Xenocore
10511038	10514999	Hey, I'm not sure, I didn't get to the beginning of this show.
10515019	10518140	Did you guys give out the news about Star Wars already?
10518580	10523181	No, we didn't, but now that you say it, I'm like, oh yeah, that was some pretty big news.
10523261	10525122	But Xenocore, since you brought it up, I'll let you share.
10525942	10527742	Well, they're turning it off.
10528022	10529623	Galaxies is going away.
10531203	10534624	Does this surprise you, though, with the new one coming out next year?
10535144	10535564	Not at all.
10535664	10537465	They're hurting, is what they're doing.
10539173	10543522	Sometime after the game, the servers are going offline in December.
10543903	10547249	What, you mean that new player experience didn't revolutionize the game?
10548051	10549193	Don't get me started, Rob.
10552214	10553234	My bad.
10553254	10555115	Did you hear that tone suddenly shift?
10555655	10556636	Oh no, you didn't.
10557936	10562198	It's not so much that, but that's going to extend this show about another hour and a half you get me on that.
10562718	10566060	He had such powers because it's so easy to become a Jedi now.
10567761	10569982	But yeah, they're going to turn it off at the end of December.
10570362	10575784	And they're just trying to herd all the players to the Old Republic is all they're really trying to do.
10576005	10578946	What can other games learn from Star Wars Galaxies?
10580285	10585428	Don't redesign the entire system without telling your players ahead of time.
10586028	10586608	Pretty good idea.
10588189	10591210	What do you most hope for when it comes out of the new Star Wars game?
10591270	10593231	I imagine you're going to play it if you're following the old one.
10593251	10594432	You're probably going to try the new one, right?
10596393	10606097	I'm reserving myself until I see it in action, though, because although technically the old game did not have any levels, it was skill-based, you can never avoid grinding in an MMO.
10607887	10610351	because you have to spend time using your skills to get better.
10611112	10612875	There's going to be a grind somewhere in there.
10612915	10614317	It's almost impossible not to.
10617241	10618443	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10619765	10620185	Nah, man.
10620225	10621467	Just keep up the good work.
10623061	10623662	Derpy Who's
10649892	10654033	There was an editing mistake in the first episode to where one of the ponies was drawn cross-eyed.
10655394	10658395	And so 4chan ran off with it and named her Derpy Hooves.
10658415	10659315	I have to look this up.
10660636	10661636	It's already on Know Your Meme.
10661656	10662796	There's a reference for it already.
10663337	10664777	Oh, this just in?
10664857	10666017	Yes, I've received a news bulletin.
10666117	10667078	And Rocketboom covered it as well.
10667138	10669619	I'm throwing out my fucking television when I get home.
10669699	10671579	Yes, that news just in.
10671619	10672039	There it is.
10672900	10679342	And on top of that, 4chan came up with a backstory that she's a mail carrier.
10679842	10690750	and since the the series creator is a lurker unfortunately she decided to incorporate it so later on she included this scene to where she messes up and drops some stuff one of the main characters heads
10691385	10700513	and they do a cut up in the air where all the Pegasus horses are looking at and you see Derpy who's dropping something, you know, on top of the other characters.
10700593	10701033	Xenocore?
10701433	10701934	Xenocore?
10702114	10702434	Xenocore?
10702454	10704076	You know way too much about this.
10704896	10709560	I pay attention to what I see and it's on three news shows already.
10709900	10712442	Are you now or have you ever been a brony?
10713785	10716571	I found a picture of Drippy Hooves and put it in the chat.
10716792	10717273	Oh, hooray.
10717714	10719519	All right, Xenocore, I'm just fucking with you.
10719779	10720341	Have a good one.
10720361	10721383	Thanks for the call.
10721404	10722025	Have a good show, man.
10722386	10722667	Later.
10724258	10725039	I am saving this.
10725119	10728302	How do I feel about 4chan controlling what's on my television?
10728922	10730724	I feel a little violated, actually.
10731124	10732085	I love the name, though.
10734548	10734888	Derp!
10734908	10738932	Derp derp!
10738952	10741974	877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

10780463	10780863	Fabulous!
10804988	10809189	Before I get into that, I just want to say tonight's show is just pretty damn awesome.
10809409	10809890	Well, thank you.
10810030	10813311	Because no one's been drinking yet, and it's just been awesome.
10813411	10814731	No one's been drinking yet.
10814991	10815931	We're high on life.
10816052	10816912	Oh, really?
10817132	10818512	I'm too old to drink now.
10818592	10819893	My bladder can't handle it.
10820353	10820953	Bullshit.
10820973	10825174	Y'all are probably high on pixie sticks or something.
10825254	10826315	God, here comes Dan.
10826415	10826695	All right.
10827575	10828035	Ah, shit.
10828215	10829496	So what's on your mind tonight, Rama?
10829676	10830236	What are you doing?
10831016	10836257	I have in front of me a bottle of Captain Morgan and a double shot.
10836657	10836957	Uh-huh.
10838357	10844199	A toast to Orange Lounge Radio, its hosts, the fan base, and a nine-year anniversary.
10844659	10847799	Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.
10848159	10851740	If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
10852080	10853160	Amen, brother!
10853180	10857001	I'm gonna feel that in the morning.
10858722	10859622	I'll drink to that, bub.
10860442	10860722	Mm-hmm.
10862131	10862491	Awesome.
10863552	10863892	So.
10865193	10865613	Yes.
10866794	10869775	Anything else you want to share with us tonight after that lovely toast?
10869815	10870216	Maybe.
10870496	10870716	What?
10870776	10873097	If we should announce it live on air.
10873477	10874238	Okay.
10874378	10875098	I'm a little afraid.
10875178	10877139	What are we going to announce live on air?
10877860	10880581	Something that we discussed on Twitter Friday night.
10881522	10882322	What's that, Ranma?
10883783	10885204	Our little engagement.
10887373	10887914	That's right.
10888534	10895299	Since gay marriage passed in New York, which of course is a wonderful thing, you know, it's great, you know, hooray for equality.
10895519	10897100	How are you and Ranma getting married?
10897140	10900903	Yeah, the first thing I did, I went to Twitter and I said, where's my marriage proposal, Ranma?
10903165	10903705	I knew it!
10904626	10907308	Well, Ranma, I'm not saying yes until I get a ring on it.
10908869	10912392	Well, you'll get the ring faster than Salacious Papa popping on there, I guess.
10912512	10912892	I don't know.
10914324	10921665	No, I mean, Salacious Pop knows that he's the one for me, but, you know, now and then, I like a little dark chocolate.
10923566	10925506	Well, you know what they say, why don't you go black?
10930007	10935288	You missed Dan in the other room, going, oh my god!
10935308	10939568	Dan, mad bro?
10939689	10940249	You mad bro?
10944005	10949007	Alright, well, Ranma, until our honeymoon, I gotta say goodnight for now.
10949628	10950708	That's quite alright, man.
10950728	10951308	Thanks for the call.
10951408	10954830	Just so you know, my girlfriend isn't mine because she plays on both sides.
10954850	10955650	No, I know, it's hot.
10956030	10956330	Alright.
10956531	10957011	Hell yeah.
10958051	10958391	Later.
10958872	10959152	Later.
10961113	10965695	Alright, 1877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10966015	10967195	Give us a call, we'll talk.
10967996	10968616	Are you sure?
10970000	10971862	Maybe I'll get more marriage proposals tonight.
10971882	10972142	Who knows?
10972162	10972823	We'll see.
10973463	10974004	What'll happen.
10974244	10976666	Now you need SSJ100 Matt to call you.
10977407	10978067	There you go.
10978087	10978768	Another New York.
10978788	10980950	That's what you're looking at me for, Rob.
10980990	10984533	Slices pops in chat and he's just commented on the situation.
10985054	10985955	He said the following.
10986535	10988697	Someone's about to wake up in the Hudson River, to be honest.
10993141	10994822	I'm not sure if that was for me or Ranma.
10994862	10996083	I guess we'll find out.
10996103	10999564	Bones006 says, once you go balk, you will never go back.
11000105	11000985	Nice typo there.
11002826	11003246	All right.
11004347	11006148	We've got time for one or two more calls.
11009229	11011931	Ranma said to Salacious Pop, oh baby heart.
11015893	11017333	Snap, snap, there's a call coming.
11017634	11018174	Snap, snap.
11018454	11019555	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11019575	11019955	Who's this?
11019975	11020355	Scott.
11021721	11023483	Nathan Legend What is up?
11025164	11032990	I wanted to talk about Smurfs and 3D First question and response, how high are you?
11034011	11043338	Alright, let's talk about all at once, the Smurfs and 3D, all at once Okay, so I think this is going to be the best movie of 2000 plus
11045782	11047262	How high do you have to be to think that?
11047302	11048843	No, no, let's hear the man out.
11049243	11050663	Every gamer gets a voice.
11050983	11051984	Except you.
11052724	11057465	Okay, so first of all, I use Smurfs in my daily language.
11057885	11060566	So in order to complete my vocabulary, I say Smurf.
11060926	11062927	I say, what Smurf is it?
11062987	11063887	Like, what time is it?
11064087	11067448	So, you know, I believe this movie will help us.
11068823	11069243	You know what?
11069263	11070464	You're getting sonic screwdrivered.
11071585	11074107	How does this game rate on a scale of one to five Smurfs?
11074827	11075828	Exterminate!
11076669	11080992	Is this game like a jokey Smurf or is it like Smurfette?
11081652	11086236	Is this game a jokey Smurf or is it the one game in the village everybody else is going to bang?
11087515	11088536	Smurfette.
11088556	11091097	Now Smurfette's got younger competition, remember?
11093018	11093859	For legal reasons.
11093959	11100682	So you really think that the Smurfs is going to be the greatest cultural phenomenon of our time.
11100883	11103904	They're going to refer to this generation as the Smurf generation.
11104605	11106746	Yes, it's going to change the economy and everything.
11108308	11109928	Until the advent of Derpy Smurf.
11109969	11112169	We'll have to pay him Smurfberries.
11113009	11117210	And it's all because Obama's president, according to the BBC, apparently.
11118371	11119731	Yes, we can't come up with Smurfs.
11119831	11120551	Yes, we can.
11121652	11122592	Yes, we can.
11122712	11123172	Smurfs 2012.
11125013	11126633	Papa Smurf for president.
11126993	11127953	He'd be a little old.
11129834	11131194	And that and he's not from America.
11132255	11133195	From America.
11134949	11139173	I'm from America, USA, USA I have a response to that whole thing
11159454	11160055	You know what?
11161456	11166421	One thing I will never regret about nine years of Orange Lounge Radio is phone calls like that.
11169624	11172567	Things that just make you say, what the fuck, guys?
11175510	11176030	You know what?
11176451	11180775	Hey, the only downfall is that we don't have our sweet around.
11182600	11183980	We have a Swedish con!
11202611	11203231	Well, then fine.
11203251	11204032	I'm going to have to call.
11204112	11204913	I'll run outside.
11204953	11206474	I'll say, hey, be right back, guys.
11206494	11207394	I got to use the bathroom.
11207414	11208275	I got to take a big dump.
11208335	11210196	And then I'll go outside and I'll call my cell phone.
11210236	11212517	Which is funny because the bathroom is like across the hall from the studio.
11213018	11214319	Oh, this is the Swedish chef.
11215499	11217120	And I'll just be the Swedish chef calling in.
11217180	11218942	And it'll be incredibly racist.
11218962	11220723	We could call the IKEA customer service line.
11221897	11222177	Rob.
11222817	11223598	I'll just play ABBA.
11224818	11226699	Let's just settle on Mr. Bucket for president.
11228819	11229980	Do not bring that to the show.
11230080	11230700	Mr. Bucket.
11230740	11233941	God, that thing is so funny.
11233961	11239083	Did you watch the angry video game nerd when they were being haunted by Mr. Bucket?
11240604	11241324	Do I want to know?
11241384	11241604	No.
11241864	11243144	I love the angry video game nerd.
11243164	11243885	This was great.
11244565	11244825	Alright.
11245865	11247246	Let's go to one more call here.
11247266	11248206	Let's see what happens.
11248686	11249727	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11249747	11250127	Who's this?
11252010	11252952	What is up, Saku?
11254054	11256919	Nothing much, just getting ready for tomorrow for work.
11257380	11259745	And just congratulating you on...
11260823	11263105	Like what, nine years now that you've been on the air?
11263125	11264946	Yeah, it's been about nine.
11265107	11268149	So, Zaku, you've been here for almost nine of those years.
11268209	11269310	You've been here for quite a bit of it.
11269450	11269930	I know that much.
11269950	11272732	Yeah, I think I was here for seven of those.
11273133	11276916	What do you think, you know, there's an important question asked on Twitter a while ago.
11277016	11280058	What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years?
11282560	11289626	What is the most impactful thing that's happened in nine years of Orange, not just Orange on the Street, but in nine years of video gaming?
11290817	11291918	Oh, wow.
11292919	11297163	Damn, that's a... Well, I guess I could give you the benefit of both.
11297283	11302968	Like, for Orange Lounge Radio, you're breaking away from Live 365, changing up the format.
11303068	11304389	It's kind of like graduating.
11305070	11308653	You started off with Imani, but now you're just encompassing video games in general.
11309054	11310115	Yeah, we're out of pull-ups now.
11311296	11312136	Right, exactly.
11312397	11314098	I'm a big kid now.
11314398	11314959	Wow!
11315139	11316600	Video gaming, oh wow.
11317714	11332781	Just the fact that we've evolved from just playing with controllers and through traditional channels, through the arcades, but just evolving to not needing the controller at all.
11333081	11334301	Being the controller.
11335542	11337623	You being the controller, essentially, with the Wii.
11338944	11346187	Well, I know the Wii is kind of like you do need the controller, but you're using your extremities to actually...
11347908	11349188	to register input.
11349248	11351749	I got one extremity I still can't use to play a game.
11353349	11355310	Oh, I'm sure there's ways, sir.
11355770	11356670	I am sure of it.
11358350	11359351	You're just not thinking out loud.
11359371	11363331	The first thing I'm doing when I get my copy of Child of Eden is I'm going to try playing with my dong.
11364972	11373934	In nine years, I've seen basically Microsoft take that little platform that could and just go far with it.
11374034	11374694	I have to admit.
11376087	11379150	They did ten times as better as the Atari Jaguar.
11379650	11382994	Just be thankful, listening audience, that they don't have a cam right now.
11384035	11390581	Sorry, I was doing my Child of Eden with my dong while you were talking.
11390962	11392443	Isn't that illegal in some states?
11392703	11393044	Probably.
11393304	11398269	See, Rob, that won't work because you don't have a glove at the end to make it look like a hand because it still thinks it's a penis.
11398909	11399390	Oh, shit.
11401806	11426077	but yeah it's like that that whole evolution like gaming it's like it's it's going beyond what I when I grew up with before then was just like you know going to a friend's place to play like Genesis and Super Nintendo games or the PlayStation but it's like something you could sit down you could go online through Xbox or PS3 and just like you know and get yelled at by by 10 year old kids
11427123	11432330	We've come a long way from the old school Atari 2600 controller, which if you think about it now was kind of phallic.
11433031	11435033	I mean, yeah, it's very archaic.
11435113	11440941	It's so primitive that it was just a four-way stick and a button.
11442574	11443275	That's all it was.
11443935	11445797	I'm saying a giant phallus, basically.
11448199	11455166	All the way down to at least 8 to 10 actual controls on a controller.
11455926	11462052	And with the fact that you could actually use your body to control things.
11462172	11465535	I mean, the next step will probably be PS9 when they insert...
11466676	11470477	When they actually feed all that data straight into your head.
11470557	11471797	It's the holodeck.
11471957	11474838	Every generation of gaming is one step closer to the holodeck.
11475298	11475958	Yeah, we're close.
11476058	11477439	All we need is the VR headsets.
11478339	11485801	All we need are headsets in which I can basically play back memories and other stuff or just have that piped directly into my brain.
11487130	11487570	And that's it.
11487610	11494293	I just literally sit there, close my eyes, and I basically become that deeper into the game.
11494353	11495553	You are the machine.
11495833	11496634	And then you're a Borg.
11498094	11499175	I'm still thinking about my dong.
11504252	11506374	Anyhow, all right, Saku, we've got to let you go to get some more calls.
11506814	11506994	All right.
11507074	11507635	But take care, buddy.
11508435	11510617	All right, have a good one.
11510637	11510977	Bye.
11510997	11511758	1-877-GAME-OLR.
11512138	11512979	Swedish.
11513459	11515501	I guess we can do one more call.
11515661	11516482	Swedish.
11516502	11518503	I guess we could do one more call.
11519204	11522166	Whoever might call us on our nine-year anniversary show.
11522526	11523087	See what happens.
11526317	11528840	Yeah, we're running a little long tonight, but whatever.
11529081	11529882	It's a birthday show.
11530102	11530683	We can do that.
11531043	11533447	Why are you complaining about something running a little long?
11533467	11534188	IDK
11538089	11540531	Are you still reading about that derpy horse?
11540811	11550437	I was trying, because he said it had been... It's like a fan character that was... My intention on bringing up the My Little Brony thing was not to get you all addicted.
11551218	11553319	That's actually not what I meant.
11553559	11555841	Those are not baked goods.
11555881	11556661	Those are baked bads.
11556681	11560044	I am just reading the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic wiki.
11560064	11562865	Okay.
11563746	11565207	Hey, we have an Orange Launch Radio wiki.
11565227	11565807	Did you know that?
11565887	11566988	It's been updated.
11567028	11569109	And if we can get a wiki, they can get a wiki.
11569169	11570069	I look at it weekly.
11570609	11570870	Do you?
11571890	11573291	Yes, when I have to pick the classic game.
11573451	11574631	Let's go to another call.
11575292	11576252	Maybe this will be the last one.
11576993	11579174	Why am I giving out the number again if this is the last call?
11579794	11580194	No!
11580354	11581015	Oh, no!
11581075	11582615	You talk about this weed!
11584136	11584616	Oh, boy.
11584917	11586377	Jessica Harper's... Oh, well.
11586397	11587038	What the hell?
11591991	11593551	Bork, bork, bork to you too.
11594032	11596252	Jessica Harper has summoned the Swede.
11596812	11599013	And just like that, a wild Swede approaches.
11599113	11600533	Quick, throw a pester ball.
11600973	11604014	Dancing queen, feel the beat.
11604574	11607895	A half-gay, oh yeah, um, a little woman who says it.
11608035	11608795	Oh, well, what the hell.
11609375	11610916	Um, but here's the thing, though.
11610936	11612956	But, but, but, but, but, here's the thing, though.
11612976	11618938	It's like, yeah, Swedish music festivals are like, it's like Swedish fucking play, you mother fucker!
11624598	11630983	and I'm gonna see it.
11631183	11635566	The Swedish Music Festival is the same weekend as the 10th anniversary of OLR.
11635987	11636547	That's the whole thing.
11637027	11638088	If we can't get the Swede
11642566	11650693	on USL for our anniversary, then of course I'm going to have to subject you to the Swede on your anniversary.
11650993	11653335	Thank you very much, Jackie Rupert.
11653456	11656378	You heard it here first, 10th anniversary from the Swedish Music Festival.
11656418	11657459	Well, here's the thing.
11658320	11665366	If the Swede can't make it to 10 years of USL, then 20 years of USL will be in Sweden.
11666147	11666947	Oh, okay, yeah.
11668047	11668587	There we go.
11668867	11669468	There you go.
11669728	11674448	So we'll be the ones up at five-something in the morning because we have to maintain the time zone.
11674849	11683110	No, it will actually be in Sweden so that Travis can start off the show by saying, Sweden, I am inside you.
11686490	11689031	And that excites the owls far too much, obviously.
11689051	11691671	Oh, yeah.
11696757	11701079	To question from our chat room, TigerClaw wants to know, is the Swedish music festival a rave?
11702540	11708202	No, it's not, but it's like Arvika Festival is kind of in a way, yes.
11709302	11710103	Let me ask you this.
11710543	11713184	How many people will you make out with at the festival?
11715905	11718046	If I know myself, none.
11719026	11719907	Then it's not a rave.
11721247	11724809	Well, the unfunny part is that, well, I'm like one of those...
11725478	11740606	I don't know, because here's the unfunny part, is that the thing is that I haven't went to a so-called classical Swedish music festival in like six or five years.
11741927	11745168	So I don't know, I might be out of touch of sorts.
11745829	11750791	See, I think I can get closer, and that's the only reason I stick with Pot of Pot of Paradise, drop E, and hump the coin return.
11752292	11753833	Okay, oh well, I have.
11767322	11779886	I'm going to let you have the last say here tonight on the Skype line and I want to know the question I've asked a few other callers that we got through Twitter what's been the most impactful thing in the past nine years in gaming do you think?
11783220	11790646	Ooh, that's... I have no idea.
11792207	11798011	The only thing that I can think of off the top of my head is like the Wii controller!
11798131	11799432	What the hell?!
11801413	11802654	No, no, I'm sorry.
11802954	11807817	I apologize to the rest of the listeners at this point, but Travis and I have to know.
11809418	11811320	Have you shoved a Wii controller up your butt today?
11811340	11811380	No!
11812874	11814855	No, I have not, unfortunately.
11815015	11817256	I have shoved other things off my butt.
11818416	11819216	Thank you, sir.
11821817	11822838	And he doesn't disappoint.
11823138	11824438	And we'll end on that note.
11824458	11825719	Thank you, Aki Ripper.
11826279	11827940	Have fun at the Swedish Music Festival.
11827960	11828380	So, later.
11828420	11828600	Later.
11835262	11841366	I can think of no better way to cap off nine years of Orange Lounge Radio than that.
11841686	11843928	Now we have 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry, so bye everybody.
11846850	11850592	I haven't shoved Wii controller up my ass today, but I shoved something else up my ass.
11853354	11855595	Hey, Mr. DJ.
11857116	11858197	Rob just turned red.
11858217	11858817	You're welcome.
11862082	11863444	You're so very, very welcome.
11863484	11866948	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as if I need to ask tonight.
11867389	11871354	Loki, thank you for being here as you always are.
11871975	11872535	No problem.
11872756	11874017	And let's make it to year 10.
11874978	11875940	What's your final thought tonight?
11876874	11880536	My final thought tonight is Earth Defense Wars, Insect Armageddon next week.
11880717	11881897	I cannot wait to play it.
11882998	11883999	Screw everything else.
11884699	11887901	I don't give a crap about your fucking Black Eyed Peas experience.
11888222	11890003	It's all about blowing up insects.
11890623	11891404	Large insects.
11891784	11894186	Let me go to the guests tonight and get their final thoughts as well.
11894206	11896947	Drew Nami, first off, our ever-present intern.
11897308	11898989	Good luck with everything going on in your personal life.
11899049	11904773	I know you got a lot of change coming on the horizon, but we appreciate you stopping by to tip your hat at our little program, our Dog and Pony show.
11904933	11905773	I'll be back.
11906154	11906474	All right.
11907274	11907975	Your final thoughts tonight?
11908695	11910496	Wii Controller, what the hell?
11912997	11933847	Jessica Harper, I don't know what to say to you right now I think I'm going to thank you for being here tonight I might take that back tomorrow Once the ratings come in for the show In all seriousness, best of luck on your audition Knock them dead And let's karaoke sometime, that would be fun Yeah, totally Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11935128	11938631	I'm just going to do my final thought as a nice big butt plug.
11939532	11946638	And please, guys, go ahead and go to understationlive.org and download some podcasts.
11946658	11947218	Check us out.

11955246	11959029	But Travis has the common decency to hang up on people, too.
11960839	11966141	Alright, and let's see, I'll let DarkSakura go last, so I'll give my final thought.
11966401	11971203	My final thought is thank you everybody.
11971603	11972323	That's my final thought.
11972343	11972663	Thank you.
11973743	11974724	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11975564	11976664	I am a banana!
11978205	11979725	I live in a giant bucket.
11981406	11983267	My spoon is too big.
11983567	11988988	From all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, thank you for putting up with us for the past nine years.
11989008	11990289	My anus is bleeding.
