1
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:18,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, May 1st, 2011, the PlayStation Network remains down after an entire week.

2
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:23,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Portal 2 plans free DLC, and Nintendo plans a free game from the 3DS shop.

3
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:38,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:46,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live with episode number 411, the 411 if you will, on this May the 1st of 2011.

5
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,883
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, with me as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not put you in a potato.

7
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:56,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

8
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:57,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And feed you two birds.

9
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:57,962
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

10
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's kind of funny because I was at Trader Joe's today, which, by the way, super crowded grocery store today.

11
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a madhouse.

12
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:08,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was some hash browns that were on sale.

13
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And the little label on it says, when I grow up, I want to be hash browns.

14
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:15,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't help but think of the same thing.

15
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:16,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow.

16
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave inadvertent spoilers today.

17
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:19,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one she was spoiling, of course, was the one and only Techmaster, Loki!

19
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:25,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked, so it's alright.

20
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:26,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, yeah.

21
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep the show spoiler-free, guys, don't worry about it.

22
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:28,794
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:29,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

24
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:31,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, long time no see.

25
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:41,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little while, because we were off for, uh, two weeks ago, and then last week, Easter week, you were, you were like, oh, I gotta do family stuff, because I have a baby now, and so family stuff's important, so whatever, Loki.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,261
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?

28
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going alright.

29
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

30
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:48,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting going on with the baby and that whole stuff?

31
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:53,275
[SPEAKER_03]: He's scooting forward now, which means he'll be crawling hopefully soon.

32
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:54,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

33
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the video.

34
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,641
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks so proud of himself.

35
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,215
[SPEAKER_03]: He is very proud of himself.

36
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,776
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I can move!

37
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:03,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait till I start walking!

38
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:08,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Today he learned how to smack Mommy in the face when she's not listening.

39
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:09,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Gave her a bloody nose.

40
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,078
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

41
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:14,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

42
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:17,439
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets excited sometimes and he flails around.

43
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,739
[SPEAKER_03]: He still doesn't have fine motor control.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever's holding him is subjected to the brunt of his attack.

45
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Has he tugged on your face?

46
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:28,823
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he does it all the time.

47
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:31,905
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:37,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to start off the show, of course, with how was your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.

49
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,267
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to, of course, introduce the chat room because they're always there with us.

50
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night where gamers seem to be very opinionated this week.

51
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:52,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't possibly imagine what could possibly have so many people with so many polarizing opinions.

52
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:58,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It couldn't be that we're on day 11 of a certain network being down, which is certainly the longest.

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

54
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,231
[SPEAKER_03]: UPN's down?

55
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:15,537
[SPEAKER_04]: UPN merged with Warner Brothers years ago All that aside, we'll get into that But first, a little lighter fare How was your gaming week and what games have you been playing this week?

56
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:15,997
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

57
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:17,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing a lot of stuff.

58
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I played DDR on Wednesday.

59
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza, which was actually pretty good.

60
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:28,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So I cannot call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza anymore.

61
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:36,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Julian's fourth birthday, and so we did the twister and everything, and he was a big boy and went on that.

62
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:37,926
[SPEAKER_04]: John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

63
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:39,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually pretty good.

64
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:40,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually really good.

65
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,988
[SPEAKER_06]: They're afraid of pizza.

66
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:42,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty good.

67
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,849
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has it been since you've had pizza?

68
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:47,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty good.

69
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:48,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

70
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:51,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I managed to get those both when they were fresh, the pizzas I had.

71
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a pizza snob and I think their pizza's terrible, but that's because I haven't had it in a while.

72
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

73
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I like the macaroni and cheese pizza.

74
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:03,306
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, speaking of food, would you please tell the listeners what you had before the show tonight?

75
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:05,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a fish taco.

76
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Rob, for my taco.

77
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And damn it, people, I asked for more than 10, not more than 30.

78
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:20,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, if you have no idea why DarkSakura was rewarded with a taco earlier tonight, you have to listen to last week's show.

79
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like that I completely bullshitted you into getting me a taco.

80
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of fucked up.

81
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:26,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time I want something.

82
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:26,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

83
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:27,205
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

84
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,806
[SPEAKER_06]: How about after the show I get you Pinkberry?

85
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing if I didn't have work in the morning and I already foresee this show running long.

86
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:36,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about after my finals are done?

87
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:37,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

88
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:38,574
[SPEAKER_06]: We go celebrate at Pinkberry.

89
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:39,935
[SPEAKER_04]: That works for me.

90
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:40,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, back to games.

91
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:41,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll buy Alan some too.

92
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:55,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I played some Ditter and I played this percussion master game that's supposed to be like Taiko no Tatsujin only it's a lot different and kind of sucky and had really bad covers of songs in there but I had fun playing it.

93
00:04:56,244 --> 00:05:03,727
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I played Afterburner Climax in the arcade because it's the only arcade machine I've seen and I love that game.

94
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:04,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it make you climax?

95
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I was moist.

96
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:15,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I just got done playing DDR.

97
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:22,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got Portal 2 which I got two days ago.

98
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:25,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it Friday night and I'm already almost caught up with you

99
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:28,357
[SPEAKER_06]: because I had bad insomnia.

100
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:40,565
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem is that I'm only playing it on Steam because, you know, I'm kind of glad I don't have the PlayStation 1 because of certain malfunctions.

101
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me while I clean something up off the floor.

102
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:51,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and cause you know, I honestly wouldn't have played it on the console anyway, so I'm really digging playing it on Steam.

103
00:05:51,695 --> 00:06:02,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I play with a trackball mouse, which I'm having a good time, but yeah, I have just found, well, it's a little bit of a spoiler, but I don't care, I'll say it anyway, I found Potatoes.

104
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,065
[SPEAKER_06]: As they refer to her on the Half-Life wiki as Potatoes.

105
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:09,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's been pretty cool.

106
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:14,129
[SPEAKER_06]: You've heard me bitching about puzzles that make me violently ill.

107
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:17,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's my husband, I think.

108
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,483
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a visitor.

109
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:19,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a friend.

110
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so...

111
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:28,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I also, crap, what else did I play?

112
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I played some Dragon Age, but I'm kind of forgetting about Dragon Age for now.

113
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:38,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go ahead and give it back, because I've got Portal, although I'm probably going to end up having it beaten in the next couple days.

114
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got level 60 for Rebecca Black.

115
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:42,952
[SPEAKER_04]: On WoW?

116
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:43,472
[SPEAKER_04]: On WoW.

117
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:44,112
[SPEAKER_04]: World of Warcraft.

118
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have to play co-op, because co-op's a lot of fun, too.

119
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-op, well... No, co-op.

120
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:50,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal, dummy.

121
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't call me dummy, dummy.

122
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I booted Darwinia.

123
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:57,428
[SPEAKER_06]: But Portal.

124
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of like... It's pretty.

125
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is pretty.

126
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:09,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been taking tons of screen captures because my favorite thing in this game so far are the work posters.

127
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:37,605
[SPEAKER_06]: but for me being a big graphic design nerd I love how perfectly they capture the styles of each era the further along that you're in the facility like the stuff from the 40s and 50s and then the 60s style logo and as you move up through the facility and you come to the modern age they really did capture the design of those different eras really nicely

128
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,567
[SPEAKER_06]: and I love the allergen poster.

129
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:42,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, know your allergens.

130
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen, pet dander, plastic, anti-matter.

131
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:54,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Please let us know if you see anyone from the FDA, the FHA.

132
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,861
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of great little jokes just in the artwork.

133
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, part of what makes this game so phenomenal is that, you know, there's just, you can just be kind of walking around looking at the scenery.

134
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just the, you know, very similar to the first game.

135
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how there were like the cave drawing type of things?

136
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:11,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Which are still there.

137
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:12,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're there.

138
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:16,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're not totally throughout, but you find them in certain places.

139
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know why?

140
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:18,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the signs or jokes do.

141
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,712
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why they're not fully through there?

142
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me without spoiling?

143
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:24,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll read the Lab Rat comic.

144
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:28,375
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a comic that ties Portal to Portal 2 called Lab Rat.

145
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,275
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a free PDF.

146
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:31,856
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it on the Valve website.

147
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:40,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And it talks about Ratman, who was the guy that was living in the facilities, hiding, and he apparently was a scientist.

148
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:44,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's the reason that Chella's the one being tested.

149
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:50,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Because while she wasn't the smartest or the most athletic, she had the most tenacity.

150
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,363
[SPEAKER_06]: and it says on her, never ever gives up.

151
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:58,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So she was initially rejected as a test subject and he moved her forward.

152
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is all in the comic.

153
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all in the comic.

154
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just spoiling the comic, not the game.

155
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's more to it.

156
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:10,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there's a lot more to Ratman and there's a lot more to her and just different stuff that goes on in there.

157
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:19,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's actually pretty, it's a good little tie-in and also if you haven't seen the restored ending for Portal, that ties in as well.

158
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into our chatroom and chat.

159
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:23,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Orangelandradio.com.

160
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Defective Candy is sad.

161
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:24,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm poor.

162
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:25,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't buy Portal.

163
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:27,802
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably not alone.

164
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:31,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's inevitable there will be a huge sale on Steam at some point.

165
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would anticipate it's probably going to be around the time the first batch of download content comes out.

166
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be, you know, hey, are you still not on Portal?

167
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:39,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it now.

168
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:39,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Half off.

169
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Valve likes to do ridiculous sales.

170
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:42,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.

171
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:43,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal's $10 right now.

172
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The only... Well, I mean Portal 2.

173
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Portal 2, yeah.

174
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:48,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, everybody can...

175
00:09:49,368 --> 00:10:03,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watch their retail stores because they're doing POS back-end rebates for retailers through now and I think June or the end of June.

176
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marking it down to $30 or $40.

177
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:08,257
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a POS back-end?

178
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: POS back end rebate means point of sale so basically they get it for cheaper.

179
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:22,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one they sell, they track how many they sell and they get a rebate from the publisher for it.

180
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an incentive to get them to bring in more product because they get to sell it for cheaper.

181
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:31,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Just sort of like buying mass, like buying bulk, right?

182
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:31,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sort of.

183
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:39,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happened with the five retailers that had the Wii systems for $170, because that wasn't offered to everybody.

184
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,727
[SPEAKER_03]: That was only the top five direct retailers got offered that.

185
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:49,512
[SPEAKER_03]: But with Portal 2, it's a little bit flexible, so they're getting a week where they get the market down.

186
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:54,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing down different weeks from now to the end of June.

187
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:58,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw says, let's not forget about Cave Johnson.

188
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,522
[SPEAKER_04]: He has some of the funniest stuff.

189
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:00,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love him.

190
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:05,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't realize it at first, but it's the dude that played J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man movies.

191
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's perfect.

192
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:10,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love Carolyn, which I won't say anything more about her.

193
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:12,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

194
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:17,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I, but it's, it's, I knew right away it was the same voice actor.

195
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:22,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I, I, I love her speaking voice, but I love listening to her sing.

196
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:28,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, not just the Jonathan Colton songs, but singing like she actually did the, the opera.

197
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:29,993
[SPEAKER_06]: She's an operatic singer.

198
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually gone back and listened to her sing other stuff and her voice is astounding.

199
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:35,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really gorgeous.

200
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:35,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

201
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:41,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so really most of my time has been taken up with Portal 2.

202
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:47,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been, for all of my motion sickness, I have been breezing through it.

203
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the parts that I scream and yell at.

204
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:52,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I threw up!

205
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just started Chapter 7.

206
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:14,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a few stages away from that, really.

207
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally digging it.

208
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:23,221
[SPEAKER_06]: The last fight, though, I'm not going to spoil it, because I did actually watch playthroughs a few times.

209
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:27,883
[SPEAKER_06]: The last fight looks freaking difficult, but fun, too, at the same time.

210
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to that.

211
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:29,904
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

212
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:35,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that does it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, then let's go to Loki and ask, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?

213
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't play a lot of anything, actually.

214
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Grand Theft Auto, really, because I've been playing...

215
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:44,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been editing stuff in Grand Theft Auto.

216
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've really been doing the last two weeks.

217
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:50,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did play a few other small things.

218
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:58,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Just mainly played a little bit of Unpleasant Horse, which is the new iOS game from PopCap.

219
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:02,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their kind of spin-off company that's doing it.

220
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:05,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because I don't know if there's more of these types of games coming.

221
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:06,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are.

222
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:23,642
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free, but the premise of the game, the way they came up with it, is they had a hat with a bunch of random names in it, just different parts of a name, and so they pull out the name for the game, and they have 48 hours to complete coding the game.

223
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:47,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the premise of Unpleasant Horse is you're this unpleasant looking unicorn fat chubby horse and you fly around or hop from cloud to cloud trying to land on happy white unicorn horses or whatever Pegasus is, I guess, and you crush them and make them fall into meat grinders.

224
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,361
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, and it's hilarious.

225
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:54,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, definitely worth checking out since it's free.

226
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:58,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fun, especially if you like horse violence.

227
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:01,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I do.

228
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:03,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it?

229
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,799
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we covered, was it Fourth Battery?

230
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: We covered that on the show a few weeks ago.

231
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:09,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, yeah.

232
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:13,511
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember the story about how it took a little while for them to get on the store, but yeah.

233
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even realize the game had actually come out.

234
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Last I'd heard, it had been delayed, so that's cool.

235
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:19,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

236
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:22,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what else?

237
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:30,879
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a really cool, actually, just real quick, there was a really cool story in the, I was making the rounds on the blogs this week, and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'll mention it here.

238
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear that PopCap designed some game as part of a Make-A-Wish thing for a nine-year-old.

239
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:36,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was very cool.

240
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's up there now, too.

241
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,526
[SPEAKER_04]: That game's up in the iOS store, too.

242
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very cool.

243
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of other stuff.

244
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:50,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was going to mod my laptop because these wonderful Asus laptops are not meant for proper cooling.

245
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:57,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm modding the back of it so I can play some more graphic intensive games without feeling like my lap is on fire.

246
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:00,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's see.

247
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:01,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than gaming...

248
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned a few weeks back and this is really hilarious how I was taking a test or whatever to get into Mensa well I passed that test so I'm in Mensa now

249
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:14,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

250
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to say.

251
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:17,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So now what?

252
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what do you do as a Mensa member?

253
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to be your thing now, your little M.O.

254
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:22,578
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show?

255
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:26,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Rob, as a member of Mensa, I think my opinion matters here.

256
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to tell you.

257
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,800
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing.

258
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want the plaque or whatever.

259
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on your resume, right?

260
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:32,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're wondering.

261
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:33,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang it up in your office.

262
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically it.

263
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,523
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

264
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:35,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

265
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:39,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I can attend a seminar if I want to or something, but.

266
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:40,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Go hang out with all the smart people.

267
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,987
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is I can analyze games.

268
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your midst of the placard, fucking Michael Pachter?

269
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

270
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you have one.

271
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my opinion means a little bit more than yours.

272
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:54,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

273
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:59,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, you need to go to one of these Mensa conventions, and I want to see some Mensa hotties.

274
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Mensa hotties?

275
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see a blog of Mensa hotties.

276
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,874
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be all looking like librarians, I bet.

277
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a stereotype, DarkSakura.

278
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,097
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a stereotype.

279
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Vicious stereotype.

280
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Loki look like a librarian?

281
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't look like a librarian.

282
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about the women, but okay.

283
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Librarians are hot, though.

284
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:21,104
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just, I just, I don't even know why I took the test.

285
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:23,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah Palin was kind of hot until she opened her mouth.

286
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:25,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

287
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That all depends.

288
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, your opinion of Sarah Palin.

289
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:36,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it might be even hotter if she opened her mouth, but... And when she started talking, though, then that just went downhill.

290
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like them stupid, I guess.

291
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:40,372
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

292
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:41,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was funny.

293
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:42,313
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

294
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:43,093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

295
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that's it for your Gaming Week, then I'll talk about my Gaming Week.

296
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:48,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I just did a... Sorry, sorry.

297
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did a Street Pass thing with Rob.

298
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:51,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I actually have two me's on my...

299
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:52,896
[SPEAKER_03]: 3DS now.

300
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:53,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

301
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first time my 3DS is street passed.

302
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's awesome?

303
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about getting the 3DS on the show last week.

304
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,260
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's awesome?

305
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the mall yesterday.

306
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the mall in the really nice part of town.

307
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:04,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sucked.

308
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Where all the spoiled rich kids are.

309
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:07,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I went there.

310
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:08,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Best Buy.

311
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to some other stores.

312
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, I've got to street pass with someone.

313
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:18,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's like the demo unit in Best Buy, I'm going to street pass with someone before this day is over.

314
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I get home and I see, oh,

315
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:23,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the wireless was turned off the entire time.

316
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:25,114
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really smart of me.

317
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:30,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know they put the wireless switch on the 3DS exactly where they put the power switch on the old DSs.

318
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:30,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

319
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,436
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

320
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:34,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

321
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:46,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, apparently I'm getting a link from Derek H in our chatroom is actually linking us to this website here as a part of cha-cha.com.

322
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:47,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

323
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:49,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Mensa members.

324
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually a link of some hot people that are Mensa members.

325
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Some celebrities.

326
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guarantee I'm not part of that list.

327
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,612
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not because all these people have tits, Loki.

328
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:03,913
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not have tits.

329
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:10,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Derek H, Gina Davis, Asia Carrera Portal 2, I also play some co-op

330
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously not on PSM, but I played on Steam, which was a lot of fun.

331
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:41,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we weren't using voice chat at all, because I was playing with Miklatov, and the way his place is set up, he couldn't talk, because he would wake someone up who was sleeping.

332
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:46,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was playing with him, and we were using the text chat to type back and forth.

333
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:52,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Portal also has, if you use the F key, you can point at things, like telling people where to put the portals.

334
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:53,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was nice.

335
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:57,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I would get really frustrated, I'd hit F like a thousand times on the point where I want to...

336
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, have him put a portal.

337
00:18:59,179 --> 00:18:59,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was fun.

338
00:18:59,699 --> 00:18:59,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

339
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you each have a terminus?

340
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: On the portal?

341
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, you each, it's like four portals.

342
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the co-op puzzles are four portals because you each have a portal guide.

343
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:11,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like one's not the orange and the other's the blue?

344
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:17,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, one's dark blue and light blue and the other one's dark orange and like, or I should say light orange and red sort of thing.

345
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:17,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

346
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:25,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know that in the original portal back, if you look at the beta pictures of it, they had a purple and pink portal originally.

347
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:26,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if they maybe borrowed the same scheme.

348
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,111
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

349
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,605
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's only one gel that they didn't take from that game.

350
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:52,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a sticky, I think.

351
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to look it up again, but yeah, they took the repulsion and propulsion gel from another game and they actually hired them all to help work with Portal 2.

352
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The white gel is Portal wall gel.

353
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Moon rocks!

354
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:05,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, instantly have a portal wherever you want.

355
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:18,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, that, uh, it wasn't even supposed to have portals, but yeah, the game's still fun, exciting, uh, co-op mode's great, I haven't beat it yet, but we're probably, like, I don't know, like, think we're through three of the, the areas, so, I think there's, like, five or six.

356
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:19,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

357
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:21,409
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

358
00:20:45,610 --> 00:21:02,635
[SPEAKER_04]: it is not only the original Final Fantasy 4 game redone it is redone in the style of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the PSP or 1 and 2 on the iPhone which was taken from the PSP versions not 3 which was taken from the DS versions but 4 has been reimagined like 1 and 2 were with redone sprites redone music

359
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:03,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool, though.

360
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go in and enable the original music if you'd like to hear that.

361
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the modern translation, not the original Ted Woosley one from the 90s.

362
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:12,323
[SPEAKER_04]: That's out.

363
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:13,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You spoony bard.

364
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:14,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they keep that line in.

365
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:15,726
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to keep that line in.

366
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:21,171
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest is the proper story with all the proper text for everything.

367
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: and it also has the After Years the complete set of the After Years games which were released for several bucks a pop on the Wii and did not have souped up graphics at all it was just the same graphics from the original Super Nintendo version so it's pretty cool that they released all that in one package and it has a transition episode that's completely brand new that transitions between the two games so all of it is new um

368
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:48,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

369
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:50,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful looking.

370
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:52,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that it's still 2D.

371
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:55,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hate the 3D one on the DS.

372
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was great, and I'm glad they did that.

373
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:02,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's nice to kind of play it still the old school way, just with all the souped up graphics.

374
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:07,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish this is what we could get more of on arcade or virtual console, for fuck's sake.

375
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a great thing for them to have released.

376
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,141
[SPEAKER_04]: But it works great on the PSP.

377
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

378
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,070
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

379
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:26,410
[SPEAKER_04]: and I gotta say Minecraft the website is not I'm gonna just be honest this is my true reaction a lot of people are gonna think I'm an idiot and that's fine but I'll own up to it I did not find the Minecraft site to be very user friendly because it took me a minute to kind of figure out there's like an old version that's free or there's an old multiplayer or there's a new one that you can pay for and a new multi like there's so many different modes and it's the website's kind of dated looking and whatever so I finally found my way into the game and I played it and um

380
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:53,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it like I don't get the big deal sorry guys like I don't understand why people are hailing Minecraft it's like oh my god like maybe it's more fun with more people or whatever but I found it to be about as thrilling as the program from Lego that lets you build your own Lego structures and then you can order the bricks and actually build them like all yeah um don't get me wrong that's kind of awesome too but um I did not think Minecraft was like OMG yeah

381
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you.

382
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:56,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play it too?

383
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:57,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played Minecraft.

384
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't care for it.

385
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:58,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

386
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:00,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And that made me kind of sick.

387
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:05,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, but you got the whole first person shooter thing going on that you don't usually do well with those.

388
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:08,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I didn't get it.

389
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's put together very well either.

390
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's not presented very well.

391
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:22,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's one of those like hipster things that like if you're into it, you're hip because it's like, you know, hard to, you know, get in there and play and all that and build these things, whatever.

392
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: for some reason I was reminded of a really old game on the Super Nintendo called Populous where you could kind of build and this is also on I want to say like Amiga I think it was originally an Amiga game and obviously I had a PC port at some point too and you like raised and lowered land to keep your people safe and you kind of like played God so to speak I don't know why but with the whole like building blocks and then taking them away I

393
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:56,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've played something like it before.

394
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:58,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't feel that innovative to me.

395
00:24:58,786 --> 00:24:59,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry.

396
00:25:00,228 --> 00:25:01,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that makes me not cool.

397
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not hip.

398
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:03,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's cool either.

399
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:33,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Other housekeeping, you can always join us on Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR Just the abbreviation there If you want to follow us there, and of course check us out on our website www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com No shows we're taking off in the foreseeable future We do have our 9th anniversary show coming up at the end of June But that's still a good 6 weeks away So we'll give you more details on that as we get closer

400
00:25:33,999 --> 00:26:01,473
[SPEAKER_04]: for now let's get into gaming news or as I should say you have to remember what OLR is all about you know we don't it's very very very very rare we ever break news on this show a lot of times you know we like to be friends sitting around the table talking smack about games so sometimes it's about putting the news out there on the table to discuss so because I don't think this is going to be news to anyone but we need to put it out there on the table so Loki please let's address the pink elephant in the room

401
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:02,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

402
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Network's been down?

403
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:06,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's been down.

404
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:16,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've actually bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 or Mortal Kombat, which were huge, huge releases on PS3 the week you were out, and now you can't play either of them online.

405
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:17,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

406
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Never used PlayStation Network.

407
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,619
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's been down for a while.

408
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they even...

409
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:31,559
[SPEAKER_03]: They even went and had a press conference yesterday.

410
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, press conference.

411
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Making everything official.

412
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:37,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, don't fear.

413
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's gonna be okay.

414
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:44,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, apparently they're gonna be returning some services to the PlayStation Network this week.

415
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Full services within this month.

416
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:51,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I just need to interrupt and say something because this is really important, Loki.

417
00:26:52,266 --> 00:27:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, part of, you know, kind of the, the thing that, you know, with the hack and everything is that credit card data was exposed, or at least they say, possibly could have been compromised, which hadn't come out at the time of last week's show.

418
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to say, I called it.

419
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:07,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

420
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I really hate being right sometimes.

421
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:12,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the second time this year I've been right on some major news.

422
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:19,886
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one we'll get to in a little bit because I've not had a chance to gloat with Loki here on the show but I'll get my fair share in just after we cover this story.

423
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:21,678
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

424
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:50,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the list of services that are returning to the PlayStation Network this week are the restoration of online gameplay across the PlayStation 3 and PSP systems, and it says including tiles that require online verification and download games, access to music unlimited power by Curiosity, which I might add, Curiosity is a terrible name for a service, so thanks, Sony, for coming up with a new word that begins with Q. All right.

425
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Access to account management and password reset.

426
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:58,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's important considering that our account's been breached and we need to change their passwords.

427
00:27:58,513 --> 00:27:59,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have a choice.

428
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to make you change your password when you come back on.

429
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big part of it.

430
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:10,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only that, you have to do it from the original PS3 or an email thing because some people have changed their PlayStation 3s.

431
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:17,885
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Home, Friendslist, and Chat Functionality are coming back.

432
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:24,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some other fun stuff, of course.

433
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to be, as their Welcome Back program, they're going to be offering some free stuff for you because they're sorry...

434
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:47,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the free stuff that they're going to be offering, uh, a free download with, uh, I believe they are saying that was worth, uh, $20 maybe?

435
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:52,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then 30 days free of PlayStation Plus.

436
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Curocity, 30 Days of Curocity, and a download.

437
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though all your personal information has been stolen, one download should make you forget all about that, right?

438
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:24,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh?

439
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

440
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

441
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:26,950
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

442
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:27,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe?

443
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:32,012
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really say the download price.

444
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Kazurai was saying a few thousand yen worth of free downloads, so like $20 or $25.

445
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,679
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, yeah, that's interesting.

446
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, of course, uh, there's gonna be a new PlayStation 3 firmware accompanying with the relaunch of the PlayStation Network.

447
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:57,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that the network is physically being rebuilt, um, because apparently it was just inferior as it was.

448
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it might help that if they didn't, you know, store these same, uh,

449
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:09,110
[SPEAKER_03]: On the same servers, your credit card information and all that stuff with the servers that actually sell product.

450
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to keep that stuff separate in case one gets hacked or the store gets hacked, which is more likely.

451
00:30:16,852 --> 00:30:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be doing that.

452
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:30,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, to make them sound like they're really on top of it, well, it's something we were planning on doing anyway, so we're just going to do it quicker now.

453
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:32,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We were on top of this!

454
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: are now forming task forces or sending inquiries about what's going on.

455
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:06,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess Homeland Security and the FBI are going to be helping them out, investigating the data breach and all that stuff.

456
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:11,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's supposed to make us feel good.

457
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So great, our tax money is going to...

458
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:17,425
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

459
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting access to the store through custom firmware or something like that.

460
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some development side or something.

461
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:41,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

462
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:42,865
[SPEAKER_06]: What if they staged this whole thing?

463
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:46,227
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the whole thing is... Here's what it was.

464
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:50,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really terrible because all they were doing the entire time was... Oh, those hackers!

465
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Those hackers got in!

466
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:59,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet there was never, oh, well, we're stupid and we didn't, you know, first off, we didn't encrypt any of your personal data.

467
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:01,837
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny, you know.

468
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll laugh about that later on.

469
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And then second, you know, their servers were the same servers for, you know, all that stuff.

470
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

471
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:11,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now you may.

472
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:16,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not going to be a satisfied PlayStation customer.

473
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:28,997
[SPEAKER_04]: You can throw all this free shit at me, although I don't think, honestly, and this is one of the pro-Sony things I'm going to say, because I don't consider myself a Sony fanboy or an Xbox fanboy or any of it.

474
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:37,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I chew out everyone equally, because I love gaming, and these companies screw things up, and it's usually at a management level.

475
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:38,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me angry.

476
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:47,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And what makes me, the free stuff here, I don't think actually Sony really owes you anything for free because the network was free in the first place.

477
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:51,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if your credit card gets hacked, you don't ask the bank for free money.

478
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:59,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you have a protection with your bank that the bank will, you know, if you have a fraudulent charge, you're protected against that.

479
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:03,445
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any type of decent credit card or bank, you're protected against fraud and all that stuff.

480
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:09,610
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

481
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:29,675
[SPEAKER_04]: If you weren't monitoring your stuff before, you're an idiot.

482
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:35,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, but this should have been a severe wake-up call to you if you haven't been monitoring your stuff before.

483
00:33:35,858 --> 00:33:39,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you could get your stuff stolen from a gas pump from one of those readers.

484
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get your stuff stolen from any clerk or any waiter at a restaurant that you give your cards to.

485
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Your card number gets out there exposed all the time.

486
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to monitor that stuff.

487
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:51,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this didn't serve as a wake-up call to you, I don't know what to tell you.

488
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:55,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the best way around any real risk is use cash.

489
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I suppose there's that too, but I don't want to be Tim Foyle hat either.

490
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:05,396
[SPEAKER_04]: My agreement with the bank, I'm fucking paying Visa, right?

491
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's either the interest that they're making off the credit card to begin with, or in the case of debit cards, they take a percentage of the sale and so forth.

492
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: These companies are paid to prevent fraud.

493
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:23,492
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem here is, I need to hear more about how Sony is going to prevent this from happening again.

494
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:27,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand they're hiring a privacy officer, which is fine.

495
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:31,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that they're moving their data center, whether it was planned already or not, whatever.

496
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:34,478
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're finally understanding, whoops, we fucked up.

497
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of one of those, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

498
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if they put the damn thing back up, and then they just get hacked again, they're going to be dead as a company.

499
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:46,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

500
00:34:46,744 --> 00:34:46,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

501
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:52,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like when Jack in the Box killed the people with E.C.O.L.I.E.

502
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably about 15 years ago.

503
00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:02,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Right after that happened, they were the safest restaurant to eat at because you knew if they were going to mess up again, they would be out of business, every single one of them.

504
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:05,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been able to recover from what was an unfortunate mess.

505
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:10,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously, very different scenarios because you're talking lives are not at stake in this scenario, what's going on with Sony.

506
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:17,185
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there still is certainly a big passion, big headline news thing going on here.

507
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:30,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's some other things to consider, though, is that what Sony got is that Sony needs to kind of ask themselves, you know, how are we going to prevent the hacking happening in the future?

508
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:32,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not condoning the hacking at all.

509
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, because I see some stuff going on in the chatroom.

510
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make it clear.

511
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:39,563
[SPEAKER_04]: The ultimate problem is not with Sony.

512
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:43,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's with the hackers and whoever went into the system in the first place.

513
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:44,888
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the problem.

514
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:46,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.

515
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:51,694
[SPEAKER_04]: If they try to use that credit card data that was stolen at this point, they're going to have the FBI up their ass.

516
00:35:52,254 --> 00:36:04,966
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a hacker that did this or you're somebody that buys this data from the hackers, you are an absolute moron who's just begging to go to jail because you're going to have every state agency so far up your butt.

517
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:06,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be real.

518
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:08,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do have that data, you really shouldn't use it.

519
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:11,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be fair, okay?

520
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, and so I certainly don't condone that.

521
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:27,232
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, hacking to that level where you are stealing information, whatever, and if they are trying to sell it for a profit, as some folks are saying, it's up on forums and so forth, but, you know, what's real and what's trolling?

522
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:27,953
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.

523
00:36:28,113 --> 00:36:29,155
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where's the line drawn?

524
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:30,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't condone the hacking.

525
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:37,528
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you can't help but feel like Sony kind of opened themselves up to it a little bit.

526
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:42,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Sony kind of come out in the schoolyard and kind of wave their hand saying, come at us?

527
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:48,535
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times do they get up there on the stage at E3 and say, our system is unhackable?

528
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:48,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

529
00:36:49,235 --> 00:37:03,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing this out there, and I'm not sure on the accuracy of the rumor, but let's just pretend that it's real here, because it would fall in line with the lack of dedication to safety, I guess, or of our information.

530
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:12,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the rumor is that that credit card list was encrypted with the same keys that they use for the PlayStation 3.

531
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:14,578
Oops.

532
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point is, and what I really want to get at here, and this is how Sony can really earn back my trust.

533
00:37:22,183 --> 00:37:25,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop being so fucking hard headed.

534
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:29,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It is time to admit your vulnerability.

535
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:32,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And this press conference yesterday didn't cut it.

536
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:39,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't cut it because essentially they came out there and they just, you know, they're trying to point fingers at everybody else except themselves.

537
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:44,368
[SPEAKER_04]: and honestly what really needs to happen is management needs to be shaken up.

538
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaz Harai needs to come down.

539
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:47,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

540
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:52,321
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what is really going to make me happy is for PlayStation to change their management.

541
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:54,285
[SPEAKER_04]: However, unfortunately I don't see that happening.

542
00:37:54,711 --> 00:38:00,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what's going to restore a lot of faith that customers might have in them is for them to display that level of accountability.

543
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:04,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Accountability for me, especially, is a big thing with a company.

544
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:09,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I'm seeing none of that, then I'm not going to give them my business.

545
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:14,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why I've pretty much decided I don't think I'm going to get anything else for PS3.

546
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:39,030
[SPEAKER_04]: at the end of the day I think Sony can win me back I mean it's not like corporations don't do dumb things once in a while and excuse me Xbox fanboys excuse me the Red Ring of Death thing was atrocious and was horrible on Microsoft's part but they've come a long way since then to be fair and they finally did extend their warranty and they admitted their problem that's what I need Sony to do here

547
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:45,429
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't... Until they have some accountability, I don't think I'm going to give them my business.

548
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:54,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but it's a hard situation because, you know, I can see how some of you are thinking, well, Rob, is that saying what the hackers did is okay?

549
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,196
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not what I'm saying.

550
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:57,997
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hackers did is not okay.

551
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:01,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I've said on the show before, hackers are going to hack.

552
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, this news, we've seen this stuff about Sony and so forth.

553
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:07,343
[SPEAKER_04]: They really have just been inviting it.

554
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:08,204
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole thing about...

555
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:35,892
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to subpoena everybody's PlayStation 3 that ever accessed a website even remotely related to this Geohots thing When he admitted he wasn't even coming after data in the first place He just wanted to get the other OS thing back or whatever I mean, let's be real, this all traces back to Sony taking off the other OS feature If Sony had never done that, this would have never happened Yeah, but hindsight, you know Right, but maybe it needed to happen

556
00:39:37,336 --> 00:40:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we were all getting a little too comfortable with this whole digital distribution thing Maybe this, you know, and I've said this before on the show and I still mean it This is going to set digital distribution back a little bit because this goes beyond Sony This is going to affect that horrific copyright protection thing that Capcom has If you bought a game like Bionic Commander or whatever you haven't been able to play it for the past 11 days on PlayStation 3

557
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,970
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're having class action lawsuits against only Sony.

558
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:05,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

559
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to file one against Capcom.

560
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:08,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

561
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:08,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

562
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:10,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play a game I bought.

563
00:40:10,613 --> 00:40:13,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of your problem.

564
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:16,116
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I like to see happen.

565
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I agree.

566
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to the chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Derek H in our chatroom says, I would like a press release saying they've hired a hit team to track down and assassinate the hackers.

567
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:31,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting, I did feel like at that press conference day they were really trying to finger point at Anonymous.

568
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:41,752
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know who did it, and I know they keep saying, well it could be Anonymous, but they said they didn't do it, but there's no head to Anonymous, so it could have been another cell of Anonymous.

569
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:47,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the whole thing was I think is people used Anonymous because there was that whole conflict going.

570
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:55,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So whoever it was that was planning on doing this probably said, oh, now seems like a good time because they're going to be looking at them or be distracted by them.

571
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:57,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's when they went and did it.

572
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:12,206
[SPEAKER_03]: and if it was actually what the rumor is where that it was part of this rebug firmware that was out there that gave you basically development access that you could actually download content for free and stuff.

573
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the rumors I heard that one of the reasons that they took the store down because someone found a way to basically steal PlayStation Network content

574
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

575
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:53,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, well, that doesn't sound very sure of yourself now.

576
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:54,417
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a CYA move.

577
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, and also, I guarantee that a few people may have lost their jobs over this.

578
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:03,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always unfortunate for job loss.

579
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:11,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope the right people lost their jobs over this because if it was the people down in the trenches, that's not who needs to be losing their jobs over it.

580
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:14,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to just go off speculation either.

581
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:17,035
[SPEAKER_04]: If Sony shook up their management, I want to see the receipts.

582
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:47,239
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the chat room with some more comments here Ranma says Sky yes Microsoft got a black eye for the Red Ring of Death but Microsoft stepped up to the plates and handled it when people bitched at Nintendo about the Wiimotes they stepped up now that people are bitching to Sony they turn a blind eye and say there's not a problem Jedi mind trick my ass absolutely right that's my whole point and I don't think that press conference yesterday cut it and I really don't know what is to blame except the management at Sony

583
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being a poorly managed company right now.

584
00:42:52,843 --> 00:42:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

585
00:42:55,543 --> 00:43:02,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see, also, um, some other folks in chat, uh, Defective Candy saying, Gah, it wasn't Anon!

586
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:03,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Bangs her head against the desk.

587
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:19,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, the only problem Anon has is that because it is the way it is, and I'm not knocking Anon, like, you know, whatever, it's just a subculture of the internet, but the problem with Anon is because it has no face, it's really easy to point the finger at them.

588
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:31,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy for Kazurai to get up there and say, well, Anon was in our systems, and Anon did this hacking, and we're sending the FBI and the top people on this, and we're going to make an example out of some of those Anon kids.

589
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:32,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very easy to blame them.

590
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:35,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good luck.

591
00:43:35,899 --> 00:43:42,022
[SPEAKER_03]: They have yet to find any of these people anyways, and how are they going to prove who did it?

592
00:43:42,182 --> 00:43:43,323
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best thing about it.

593
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough.

594
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:49,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The smartest thing any type of vigilante group can do on top of that is to be completely decentralized.

595
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:58,242
[SPEAKER_04]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, I don't think that's necessarily related to anything about Geohots or Anonymous.

596
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has a lot of other enemies.

597
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:08,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps everything else that was going on with the other companies showed the real person who hacked all this how easy it was to do.

598
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:14,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, I still think though a lot of what happened leading up to this helped whoever did it.

599
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:18,927
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got an email coming up that's got a pretty interesting suggestion, so I'm going to

600
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:20,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

601
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my suggestion, though, is all this free stuff you're throwing my way, like free download and free PlayStation Plus and free Curiosity, I don't care about two-thirds of that.

602
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:47,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And the download, I might not even care about that either, so... I mean, that's like saying... Imagine, if you will, Rob, that you went to a restaurant, a nice restaurant or whatever, or not even necessarily a nice restaurant.

603
00:44:48,123 --> 00:44:48,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Say you went to

604
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:50,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack in the Box.

605
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll use Jack in the Box again.

606
00:44:52,724 --> 00:45:07,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And you went there and you bought something and someone stole your credit card information, stole your identity, and you found out, you went to the management, and they're like, here's a voucher for a free jumbo jack.

607
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:10,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

608
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:13,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, would that cut it with you?

609
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:16,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would be kind of like,

610
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:19,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

611
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:21,718
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you're giving me?

612
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though.

613
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not fully convinced that only Sony is vulnerable to a hack like this.

614
00:45:30,922 --> 00:45:34,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've heard of other personal data being compromised on other websites and so forth.

615
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:45,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure I fully believe that my information is 100% secure with Microsoft, with one of their online services, Steam, with Blizzard,

616
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:46,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

617
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,079
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to freak out about it.

618
00:45:49,119 --> 00:46:00,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to panic and I'm not going to cancel all my credit cards and all that stuff because the money I pay to have a debit or credit card in the first place is supposed to pay to protect me from the fraud.

619
00:46:02,532 --> 00:46:04,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not that worried about it.

620
00:46:05,154 --> 00:46:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I can thank the PlayStation Network for being so useless to me that the last time I used my credit card, it had expired that same month!

621
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So, ha ha ha!

622
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,861
[SPEAKER_03]: You have old credit card information.

623
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck spending that money.

624
00:46:16,622 --> 00:46:22,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan was saying right before the show, though, is that the one time he finally decided to buy something on PlayStation Network, that was when Moondiver came out.

625
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:24,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's done by the dude that did Strider.

626
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:28,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Then all this goes down, and he's like, well, shit.

627
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:28,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

628
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, we never really used PlayStation Network.

629
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:34,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I had zero interest in it.

630
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:40,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't make a profile until we had our system for two years, if that's any indication, when I was playing Final Fantasy XIII.

631
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:48,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go back to this, too, in our chatroom, because this is a good point, and it came up on my Twitter earlier, but it hasn't come up yet on the show here tonight.

632
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:52,204
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerCon, our chatroom, says, You don't have to worry about Nintendo getting hacked.

633
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:55,007
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't hold any personal info other than friend codes.

634
00:46:55,647 --> 00:47:07,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, despite the shit we've given Nintendo over the years about being so fucking far behind the times when it comes to online stuff, right now, their way of handling credit card payments looks pretty fucking good.

635
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:09,530
[SPEAKER_04]: In light of all this?

636
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather have security than convenience.

637
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:17,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, the Nintendo Wii makes you put in your complete credit card info every time.

638
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:18,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't save it.

639
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:20,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes they can get a little frustrating.

640
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:22,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, here I am, putting it in again on the Wiimote.

641
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, that system looks pretty darn good.

642
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't because I'm sorry.

643
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:33,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'd actually buy anything on Virtual Console right now.

644
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

645
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's praise Nintendo for being lazy.

646
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying praise them.

647
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:52,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it's ironic how this all kind of works out where Nintendo has really nothing to lose with what happened here because of the fact they're so far behind the times.

648
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:55,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So my only point is that maybe we were moving ahead too fast.

649
00:47:56,564 --> 00:47:57,244
[SPEAKER_03]: People are motivated by spite.

650
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:27,833
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to... People like being competitive and people like challenging things that you're giving them, especially a company.

651
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:31,656
[SPEAKER_03]: They like looking at the company as the evil corporate giant.

652
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:41,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go and say, well, good luck doing that, people are going to take the David and Goliath route and they're going to try to bring Goliath down.

653
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:47,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for every hundred people that try and fail, someone's going to do it.

654
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:49,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know how you avoid that?

655
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,748
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go saying, try to hack me.

656
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:59,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking in the chat room at chat.orange.com, there's lots of interesting stuff going on in the chat room right now.

657
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

658
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator in our chat room says, I really didn't expect any freebies.

659
00:49:03,891 --> 00:49:07,392
[SPEAKER_04]: All I'd like is an I'm sorry and assurance that they're learning from their mistakes.

660
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

661
00:49:08,273 --> 00:49:09,533
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great, actually.

662
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:15,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Derek H in our chat says, Sky, that's like saying a horse and carriage looks good after you get into a car accident.

663
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:24,265
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's really funny that you use that as an example because my mom has a true diagnosed fear of driving cars and vehicles and all that.

664
00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:29,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it has to do with the fact that she just didn't like them whatever growing up or what have you.

665
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:35,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one time she decided to buck her fear and get behind the wheel of a car after going through the process, getting a license, all that stuff,

666
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:35,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

667
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:24,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually will say this I do prefer Nintendo's method of not storing the information because whenever I pay the only I think online thing ever that has my information saved is my PayPal which I used to pay for any online service now because I can stop my information from PayPal and the site won't have my information or my WoW subscription but other than that nowhere else has my information

668
00:50:25,764 --> 00:50:33,031
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, you know, the Battlestar Galactica wasn't affected by the Cylon attack because it didn't use as much future technology as the other Battlestars.

669
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:33,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent point, Bobby.

670
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:36,674
[SPEAKER_04]: At least somebody's on the same wavelength as me.

671
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:39,056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

672
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:41,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I, yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.

673
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:43,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that hasn't already been said.

674
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, where's the, I'm sorry.

675
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:47,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

676
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,400
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

677
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:50,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

678
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:55,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have another story that's kind of in the same vein as a lot of this stuff, if you will.

679
00:50:56,684 --> 00:50:58,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did I say was the root cause of all of this?

680
00:50:58,745 --> 00:51:02,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony removing the other OWASP feature in the past.

681
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:07,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And interesting enough, Sony's troubles may not be over as far as that's concerned.

682
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,672
[SPEAKER_04]: They've actually lost what could be a landmark decision in this whole thing.

683
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:12,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the deal.

684
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:16,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as major as it might seem, but it happened in Finland.

685
00:51:18,715 --> 00:51:20,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happened by what's called a consumer's board.

686
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a ruling, but it's a consumer's board.

687
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:39,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily a government legitimate courtroom ruling, but the consumer's board in Finland has decided that this man who actually took Sony to court over removing the other OS feature, that Sony needs to cough up 100 euros for doing it.

688
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:42,497
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

689
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:14,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The CCB said that the removal of other OS crippled console features that were present at the time of purchase and agreed that consumers should be compensated.

690
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:20,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It recommended that the manufacturer and seller of the console pay 100 euros jointly to compensate the man.

691
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:29,025
[SPEAKER_04]: The CCB does not have the power to enforce the ruling, but the opinion of this board in Finland is considered by the courts in a dispute.

692
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:33,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning if it does go to court, this will weigh heavily on what happens.

693
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

694
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:44,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess if Sony truly thought their system... Well, this also kind of goes back to Sony being hard-headed.

695
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:49,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony put the other OS feature in there because they were convinced it could not be used to hack their system because it was unhackable.

696
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,861
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute they found it, it was hackable, they removed it.

697
00:52:53,022 --> 00:52:54,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you shouldn't have put it there in the first place!

698
00:52:57,002 --> 00:53:01,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And still, though, it's like saying, you know, oh, well, this feature, no one's really using this feature.

699
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:09,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's a feature on something, and you remove it, people are going to be pissed, because it is, somebody is obviously using it.

700
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,631
[SPEAKER_03]: If no one was using it, why'd you put it there in the first place?

701
00:53:13,132 --> 00:53:15,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's like saying, oh, Spanish language?

702
00:53:15,874 --> 00:53:17,935
[SPEAKER_03]: No one uses a Spanish language.

703
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,336
[SPEAKER_03]: They can just speak English or French.

704
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:21,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

705
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:23,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

706
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:25,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see what develops with that.

707
00:53:25,345 --> 00:53:27,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony's troubles may not be over.

708
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:34,755
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be talking about the legal team moving from whatever was going on with Geohots to now having to deal with class action lawsuits over the downtime.

709
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:39,661
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole other OS lawsuit and there's a whole other nightmare of problems.

710
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:43,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing in the background right now.

711
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:44,728
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I hear.

712
00:53:45,128 --> 00:53:45,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

713
00:53:45,648 --> 00:53:49,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, don't you have something, just something to take my mind off all this other stuff?

714
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:49,789
[SPEAKER_06]: How about some good news?

715
00:53:49,949 --> 00:53:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: How about it?

716
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:52,310
[SPEAKER_06]: How about something for Portal 2?

717
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:55,990
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a new download content this summer.

718
00:53:56,651 --> 00:54:01,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve put out an announcement and it's free, which is great.

719
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:10,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be called DLC number one and it will have new test chambers, leaderboards, challenge mode for single and multiplayer, quote, and more, end quote.

720
00:54:11,434 --> 00:54:30,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be on all platforms Mac, PC, Xbox 360 And maybe Playstation 3 Maybe If the system's up It'll be on PS3 I'm just making a poke But hey, that's pretty cool And I so much love the game already That it'd be kind of neat to have some new stuff to do

721
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:43,865
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta admit though, every developer, every single one of them who makes money off DLC, who makes money off designing games specifically for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network platforms has gotta be looking at what's going on right now.

722
00:54:44,385 --> 00:54:45,446
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 days of lost sales.

723
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:46,306
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is free.

724
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:49,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, this is free, but it just reminds me of that whole thing.

725
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:53,548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm saying the impact on the whole digital distribution thing will be felt.

726
00:54:55,106 --> 00:54:57,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I like free things, though.

727
00:54:57,708 --> 00:55:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we do get more maps and things that let this game live on.

728
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:01,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great.

729
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:08,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good value as it is, but just if they enhance that value, especially if they have a map editor for people, oh my gosh.

730
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:13,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's one of the things I was hearing about going to be coming out, actually, is that they're... Awesome.

731
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:16,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve's always been kind of cool, though.

732
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:17,760
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what Gary's mod is, right?

733
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

734
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:23,984
[SPEAKER_06]: The modding community is really big out there, and they've paid to put some development into some of this.

735
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:35,062
[SPEAKER_06]: so they're seeing people doing the same thing with Portal and are encouraging it and I think they're supposed to have I remembered hearing something about them having some sort of level sharing coming out

736
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:37,996
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some fan wank discussion last night.

737
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:44,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was one I was on WOW about talking about how awesome it would be if there was a Tron-themed portal level or something like that.

738
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that fan wank could be a reality if they do release some of these map editors and things.

739
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody will be on that.

740
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:49,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it.

741
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ironic, but the orange and blue would fit very well with the Tron universe, wouldn't it?

742
00:55:54,588 --> 00:55:56,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see.

743
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and considering...

744
00:55:59,332 --> 00:55:59,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually it would.

745
00:56:00,452 --> 00:56:06,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine like a deathmatch portal type thing or like four player portal or something?

746
00:56:07,674 --> 00:56:08,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathmatch portal?

747
00:56:08,914 --> 00:56:09,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

748
00:56:11,275 --> 00:56:11,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

749
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:17,917
[SPEAKER_04]: There's part of me that wants to say, no, they should think about the more competitive stuff when Portal 3 comes out.

750
00:56:18,237 --> 00:56:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a part of me that says, actually, Portal 3 should probably never come out.

751
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there should be a Portal 3.

752
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:30,001
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe it's like one of those movies that really doesn't need a sequel.

753
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:32,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see at all possible how there could be a Portal 3.

754
00:56:33,763 --> 00:56:43,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, where there's money to be made, there is always... They're saying though that for Half-Life 3 that What's-Your-Face Chell is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.

755
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:50,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, speaking of like Valve and things that end in 3, I'm not so sure that's a possibility with Valve actually.

756
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:53,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they ever gotten to three in their series?

757
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:58,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Half-Life 3 Episode 3 is supposed to be... Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

758
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:00,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 3 is a myth, okay.

759
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:01,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's see.

760
00:57:01,616 --> 00:57:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead.

761
00:57:02,616 --> 00:57:03,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first two came out real quick.

762
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:05,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was never a third one.

763
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:06,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal.

764
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see.

765
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:08,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

766
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they ever get to three?

767
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:12,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing.

768
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:13,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, you know...

769
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:14,449
[SPEAKER_03]: VALVE

770
00:57:30,669 --> 00:57:35,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this could finally be where they do drop the bombshell about Half-Life Episode 3, but I don't know.

771
00:57:35,272 --> 00:57:37,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Left 4 Dead 3 with a portal gun in there.

772
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:40,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe something new.

773
00:57:40,376 --> 00:57:43,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of trust Valve with new ideas right now, you know?

774
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:50,503
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had a lot of good stuff, like Left 4 Dead, great game, often copied, portal, excellent little thing.

775
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:53,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm all for whatever they come out with next.

776
00:57:53,465 --> 00:57:57,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe one of the things they have on the horizon is their whole Defense of the Ancients.

777
00:57:57,948 --> 00:57:59,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Dota... I think it's called Dota 2?

778
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:29,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Haha, another two Yeah, they have an official Dota thing coming out Which was originally a Warcraft 3 mod But they hired the people that made it It's not the same thing as League of Legends In fact, League of Legends is kind of The Defense of the Ancients thing has gone a million different ways Because Blizzard has their own thing coming to StarCraft League of Legends is out there too By I believe some of the people that were involved with Dota in the beginning And then the people that got hired from Valve For Dota have the official Dota 2 game coming out And I think that's probably what you're going to see Most of at E3 this year out of Valve

779
00:58:32,014 --> 00:58:50,588
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow free stuff yeah free stuff is good and I'm all for continuing to expand the terrific game that is Portal 2 but I would honestly still be happy with my purchase if they never expanded it but I think I'm still having fun oh yeah absolutely I just think it's a great value anyhow Loki let's move on

780
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:52,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

781
00:58:53,030 --> 00:59:01,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other big story that was floating around the web, of course, is the oft-rumored sequel console for the Wii.

782
00:59:01,737 --> 00:59:04,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I mean, there's going to be a new console from Nintendo at some point.

783
00:59:05,821 --> 00:59:14,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Nintendo has officially announced that, yes, they will be talking about a successor to the Wii, not necessarily a Wii 2, but another console, coming for 2012.

784
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:15,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, they're saying...

785
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's gonna be shown off at E3 it's gonna be playable at E3 probably if you're pressing behind doors but you know it will be playable it'll be their thing that has the uber long line to play yes that's been Nintendo's E3 motif for years minus the airport years and of course you know tons of rumors about what it is and Project Cafe and all that fun stuff

786
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:48,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, last week we talked at length about this, because a lot of the rumors had come out.

787
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have the confirmation.

788
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:53,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's saying, okay, yes, it's happening, and we'll see you at E3.

789
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:55,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the news from this week.

790
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:57,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week we talked at length about a lot of that stuff, just so you know.

791
00:59:57,851 --> 00:59:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, would include...

792
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:08,645
[SPEAKER_04]: When I, in January, on this program said, Nintendo is showing a new console at E3 this year because they've got nothing going for them on the Wii right now but that new Zelda game.

793
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:11,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, Loki, said, no.

794
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:12,487
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're not going to show.

795
01:00:12,547 --> 01:00:14,187
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the Wii still prints money.

796
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,888
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to show a new console at E3.

797
01:00:16,268 --> 01:00:18,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to say, thank you.

798
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:24,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but you're still wrong with them not having anything coming out on the Wii.

799
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:26,716
[SPEAKER_03]: What's coming out on the Wii?

800
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:48,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They need something for Christmas this year.

801
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:51,697
[SPEAKER_03]: If the system isn't coming out until 2012, and to be fair, I had speculated, why are they waiting until 2012?

802
01:00:51,737 --> 01:00:52,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess they did the same thing with the 3DS.

803
01:00:52,938 --> 01:00:53,920
[SPEAKER_04]: They do need something this year.

804
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:09,636
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually think you calling the new Super Mario Bros.

805
01:01:09,676 --> 01:01:34,506
[SPEAKER_03]: sequel I think is a distinct possibility for the rabbit out of their hat for the Wii this year I know you guys talked about this last week but I wasn't here so I'm just going to get my take on a lot of this and you love Nintendo more than anyone on this show so definitely wonder what your opinion is listen, we gotta think like Nintendo here and why they're doing what they're doing here's how it's going to all work I think let's take the name Project Cafe

806
01:01:35,754 --> 01:01:36,494
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a cafe?

807
01:01:36,515 --> 01:01:39,556
[SPEAKER_03]: A cafe is a place that you go gather with your friends.

808
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:41,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very casual meeting place.

809
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:45,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of chatting and interactivity and that kind of stuff.

810
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:53,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe now the focus is going to be and that would be great if they actually did it more like online.

811
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:59,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of think of like Facebook stuff where you're sharing stuff with your friends.

812
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:01,429
[SPEAKER_03]: You're conversing.

813
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:03,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very casual stuff.

814
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:07,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, lots of online content we'd hope

815
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:15,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I have to say, SJ100Matt in the chatroom says, Rob, the Christmas hot seller is the Vitality Sensor.

816
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:18,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee you the Vitality Sensor is dead.

817
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:20,336
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been swept under the rug.

818
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:28,602
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you may see it rear its little ugly head on whatever, like, you know, just a little piece of metal on the back of some controller.

819
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:31,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo will never fully scrap an idea.

820
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It will rear its ugly head again at some point, but as far as the Wii Vitality Sensor...

821
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:38,669
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it got laughed out of submission.

822
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:40,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

823
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, you may see something like that.

824
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:47,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is Nintendo we're talking about here, so I don't know if they're actually going to do that.

825
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:58,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that now, being that this is the next generation of consoles, they would understand that, yes, okay, online gaming is something that people do want.

826
01:02:58,505 --> 01:02:59,386
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, social...

827
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:23,740
[SPEAKER_04]: community features something that people do like having because Facebook is popular all this stuff's popular let's let's bring it in okay so let's assume that they're gonna do oh god that's why the controllers are all touch screens because they're gonna want you to take them out in public just like the 3ds they're gonna want you to take those things with you wherever you go so when you meet people you could like do the game data trades just like the 3ds

828
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

829
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:42,314
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

830
01:03:56,255 --> 01:03:56,916
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

831
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:12,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's that.

832
01:04:12,555 --> 01:04:14,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But like a fucking iPad as a controller?

833
01:04:14,536 --> 01:04:14,697
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

834
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:16,378
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not anything like that.

835
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:22,963
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, I would see maybe it's some sort... Because you have to also understand, Nintendo's not going to compete with themselves.

836
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:27,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they release something that could be used as a portable gaming device when they have a portable gaming device?

837
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:28,427
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.

838
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:33,391
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, they would want you to use your 3DS or something like that for some sort of connectivity, but...

839
01:04:35,032 --> 01:04:35,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, okay?

840
01:04:35,753 --> 01:04:37,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing, too, is the cost of this thing.

841
01:04:37,514 --> 01:04:42,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if this controller's like $100, people are like, fuck that, I ain't buying a $100 controller.

842
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:44,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the 3DS will stand in as a controller.

843
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:46,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's how they don't bite themselves in the foot.

844
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a controller that will also do the 3D display.

845
01:04:49,706 --> 01:04:51,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's just assume, okay, let's say that...

846
01:04:53,206 --> 01:04:57,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't get me wrong, they could come up with some really low quality screen.

847
01:04:57,431 --> 01:05:01,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the PlayStation 1 little monitors that were 50 bucks or whatever.

848
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:07,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you put a touch screen display on top of there, a touch panel display, you could kind of jerry-rig something like that.

849
01:05:08,063 --> 01:05:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

850
01:05:08,624 --> 01:05:12,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so let's say that's going to happen.

851
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be interesting, I guess.

852
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:19,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're also saying that they're still going to keep the original controls as well.

853
01:05:19,852 --> 01:05:25,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like I'm expecting, this system's probably just going to upscale these old Wii games.

854
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:30,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how you see all this emulator footage with 1080p new Super Mario Bros.

855
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:32,180
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that and how it looks really pretty?

856
01:05:33,817 --> 01:05:34,237
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go!

857
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Your games are brand new again and we can still sell Wii games.

858
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're either going to take one of two approaches.

859
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They're either going to try to get everybody to go up onto this new platform or they're going to try to keep this platform along with the Wii.

860
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:56,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the Wii for the casual people that don't want to spend a lot of money on stuff and then you have this new system for the hardcore players that really want something that has the graphics and all that.

861
01:05:56,685 --> 01:05:57,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what though?

862
01:05:57,365 --> 01:06:01,426
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have those Wii games that you want to buy, they look really pretty on your new HD...

863
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:10,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say, I think you are on the money on this.

864
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

865
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:23,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate saying when you're, I think when you talk about this, yeah, and it's funny because somebody in chat, who said this in chat, said Amiga777 in chat said, please no illusions, the dolphin GameCube had next to nothing to do with water.

866
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:31,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But I honestly think, like, what's the one place where everybody always razzes Nintendo online?

867
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:33,352
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Nintendo want a piece of?

868
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:35,113
[SPEAKER_04]: What everybody's into?

869
01:06:35,714 --> 01:06:38,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the Wii was all about, was trying to get everybody into gaming.

870
01:06:38,315 --> 01:06:42,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think they don't look at Facebook and say, hmm, how could we get a part of this?

871
01:06:43,038 --> 01:06:44,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope... This is the Facebook console.

872
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just really hope that they don't try to do some stupid gimmick with this touchscreen thing, because...

873
01:06:51,864 --> 01:07:01,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't need another fucking gimmick from Nintendo I mean, let's just stop Nintendo is a fucking lazy company I'm sorry, they are a fucking lazy company And you know why?

874
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:12,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they will take the least amount of effort to put out a new game I mean, they're porting old shit for the 3DS Okay, great, you're updating stuff Why don't you create a damn new game?

875
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:14,706
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it in the same style as the old game

876
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:20,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you did the same thing with, like, you know, the Wind Waker looking stuff on, you know, the DS.

877
01:07:22,491 --> 01:07:23,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, I guess, Wind Waker, yeah.

878
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:30,957
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you did it, like, on the DS, but, you know, why can't you just create new games that look like the old games?

879
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:34,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have to port the old games over?

880
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you don't want, you want to spend the least amount of time possible working on this shit.

881
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:41,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people will buy it, no matter what you put out.

882
01:07:42,165 --> 01:07:44,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the least possible effort that they could put in a new console?

883
01:07:44,906 --> 01:07:45,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.

884
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:48,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that takes the old games and makes them look new.

885
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:49,128
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're going to do.

886
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they could put out new games that look even nicer if they want.

887
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:58,393
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, they don't have to do that much because they can just put out these low quality games and they upscale everything and it looks pretty.

888
01:07:58,573 --> 01:08:01,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't think, but I don't, this is not going to be Wii 2.

889
01:08:02,135 --> 01:08:04,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely not going to just be the Wii with enhanced graphics.

890
01:08:05,076 --> 01:08:05,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not.

891
01:08:05,696 --> 01:08:07,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a, there's a whole little follow up.

892
01:08:07,737 --> 01:08:08,918
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was, they should call it the Wii Wii.

893
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:13,000
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a follow-up article to this where they actually said, they came out and said, what is this?

894
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturo Wada comes out and says, quote, we would like to propose a new approach to home video game consoles.

895
01:08:20,683 --> 01:08:20,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

896
01:08:21,323 --> 01:08:21,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

897
01:08:21,823 --> 01:08:23,344
[SPEAKER_03]: A new approach to home video game consoles.

898
01:08:24,384 --> 01:08:26,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the Wii... Is the Facebook thing.

899
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:26,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

900
01:08:27,026 --> 01:08:30,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the Wii... But not actual Facebook, Nintendo book.

901
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:36,456
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Wii, they were trying to get people that were non-gameplayers to play this console.

902
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So were they going to try to... It's kind of hard, though, because now, were they going to try to bring... Oh my god, this would be hilarious.

903
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they'd be basically eating their own words.

904
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:54,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out with something that was very similar to the iOS marketplace or something like that?

905
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:58,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cheap-ass games, and this whole iPad-type thing.

906
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:58,792
[SPEAKER_04]: DSiWare?

907
01:08:59,437 --> 01:09:07,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I understand that they have DSiWare, but, you know, I'm saying to the point where it's, you know, more than three releases a week or something like that.

908
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:09,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just something ridiculous and very casual games.

909
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:14,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd laugh my ass off because, you know, oh, Apple, they're stupid, you know.

910
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, then we're going to copy them.

911
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:17,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

912
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:21,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really pass judgment on it yet until we actually see what it is.

913
01:09:21,762 --> 01:09:24,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, you know, let me put it this way.

914
01:09:24,422 --> 01:09:28,023
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anything like the other Nintendo promises and stuff that we've seen...

915
01:09:28,883 --> 01:09:30,904
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is really eye-roll worthy.

916
01:09:30,964 --> 01:09:32,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, remember the Wii Zapper?

917
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:34,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I go back to the Wii Zapper.

918
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: When they first showed it off, the prototype, it looked fucking badass.

919
01:09:38,727 --> 01:09:42,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, oh yeah, dude, that's the Zapper right there.

920
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:47,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they came up with this plastic shell Zapper that looked like shit, I was like, what?

921
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

922
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your controller?

923
01:09:52,827 --> 01:10:00,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of which, are we ever going to get any other controllers that plug into the bottom of the goddamn Wii Remote?

924
01:10:00,472 --> 01:10:01,473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not.

925
01:10:01,773 --> 01:10:03,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're on a new console now.

926
01:10:03,414 --> 01:10:05,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So the answer is no, Loki, you're not.

927
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:06,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer that for you.

928
01:10:07,017 --> 01:10:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: All these promises.

929
01:10:07,677 --> 01:10:10,359
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

930
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:13,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you this, because obviously you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.

931
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:15,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why people love you or hate you.

932
01:10:16,843 --> 01:10:19,564
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet you own a 3DS and you've owned multiple 3DSs.

933
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:20,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't play it.

934
01:10:20,785 --> 01:10:21,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know why I own it.

935
01:10:21,645 --> 01:10:22,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not razzing you on it.

936
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:33,009
[SPEAKER_04]: My true question for you is, what could Nintendo do at E3 with this console to make you go, okay, Nintendo, I misjudged you.

937
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,330
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the right track again.

938
01:10:35,049 --> 01:10:36,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Get with the times!

939
01:10:58,072 --> 01:11:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I need something a little bit more than just Oh look, new Mario game Oh look, another Mario Kart Oh look, another Zelda game

940
01:11:18,337 --> 01:11:19,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe make a new franchise.

941
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:23,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been dealing with these old franchises for a long ass time.

942
01:11:24,264 --> 01:11:27,327
[SPEAKER_03]: How about creating the next good franchise?

943
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe just...

944
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:29,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

945
01:11:30,008 --> 01:11:48,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting a little bit more effort into something because if we put out another Zelda game or if they take Twilight Princess and make it look even prettier or something like that or like that one Zelda game that they were showing off that was Twilight Princess at one point and then they ended up scrapping that kind of look for the game because it's a dark Zelda game or something.

946
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:50,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

947
01:11:50,345 --> 01:11:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want a little bit more than just Nintendo games and better graphics.

948
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

949
01:11:58,452 --> 01:11:58,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It

950
01:12:00,908 --> 01:12:03,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what they're offering.

951
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:04,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll have to wait and see.

952
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:05,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sorry.

953
01:12:06,594 --> 01:12:10,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I know for a fact that I'm going to be laughing my ass off during this press conference.

954
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be... Because they have these really wacky ideas of what people want.

955
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:22,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently it works for them, so I'm not going to fault them for it, but...

956
01:12:24,637 --> 01:12:52,158
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time there's consoles out there that I'm playing way more than we although to be fair my wife has gotten back to playing the Wii I did break my Wii for a little bit though and I had to fix it by swapping out the motherboard but you know and then we got back into playing some of the old Wii games that we liked like Excite Truck which Nintendo for the love of God just make another damn Excite Truck game do not make Excite Bots just another Excite Truck game with more tracks that'd make me happy

957
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a new F-Zero?

958
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:56,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I asked for on last week's show.

959
01:12:56,356 --> 01:12:56,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, whatever.

960
01:12:58,078 --> 01:12:58,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Play Speed Racer.

961
01:12:58,998 --> 01:12:59,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much F-Zero.

962
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, they just need to do that.

963
01:13:04,783 --> 01:13:05,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make...

964
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:07,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, perfect example right there.

965
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:08,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Excite Truck.

966
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:14,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Launch Wii title, use some of the features of the Wii that like, you know, like, oh, SD memory card.

967
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:15,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

968
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play your own music off the SD memory card.

969
01:13:17,495 --> 01:13:18,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really awesome.

970
01:13:18,716 --> 01:13:24,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It made that game so much more awesome because you can listen to your music while you're driving in this really awesome racing game.

971
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:25,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequel comes out.

972
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:26,722
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they do?

973
01:13:27,243 --> 01:13:27,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, guess what?

974
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:29,184
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more mini games in there.

975
01:13:29,484 --> 01:13:31,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Mini games do not belong in a fucking racing game.

976
01:13:32,026 --> 01:13:32,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

977
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:01,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that it's wacky and stuff, but it's not fucking Excite Truck.

978
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what Nintendo needs to do to make you happy is stop making sandwiches.

979
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:08,187
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to treat us like adults instead of just little kids.

980
01:14:08,227 --> 01:14:08,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it.

981
01:14:08,688 --> 01:14:10,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people, yeah, I get it.

982
01:14:10,869 --> 01:14:14,051
[SPEAKER_03]: People like the party games on the Wii because, you know, Wii is kind of a social game.

983
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't need to make every goddamn game a party game.

984
01:14:17,393 --> 01:14:20,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also don't need to make every damn game a family game.

985
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:23,317
[SPEAKER_04]: What about this comment from Forbes111 in our chat, Loki?

986
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:25,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they don't care about what you want.

987
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:25,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the money.

988
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I retorted.

989
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:28,920
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want the money, they need to care about what we want.

990
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how well did Excite Trek sell?

991
01:14:32,622 --> 01:14:33,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very well.

992
01:14:34,423 --> 01:14:36,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why they didn't give you more of that.

993
01:14:36,464 --> 01:14:37,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't advertise the damn game.

994
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an awesome game, and it's really underrated.

995
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really sad that they... But here's the thing.

996
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:45,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.

997
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:48,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do what I want, but I don't have to buy your console either.

998
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:50,859
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know what?

999
01:14:51,059 --> 01:14:56,282
[SPEAKER_03]: As consoles get more expensive and money gets tighter, I won't be buying every console that you put out.

1000
01:14:57,003 --> 01:15:00,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the 3DS was pretty much an impulse buy and you know what?

1001
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:03,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of have some buyer's remorse over it because there weren't any...

1002
01:15:05,094 --> 01:15:07,236
[SPEAKER_03]: There weren't any really must-have games at launch.

1003
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1004
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:11,259
[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't really any must-have games in the next portion of the year.

1005
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:12,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I know Zelda's coming out.

1006
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:17,823
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I've said before, Ocarina of Time is the most overrated fucking game on the Nintendo system ever.

1007
01:15:18,124 --> 01:15:18,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

1008
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:19,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

1009
01:15:20,085 --> 01:15:21,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying Ocarina of Time.

1010
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's that leave me with?

1011
01:15:24,346 --> 01:15:26,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking nothing, because there's nothing coming out.

1012
01:15:26,507 --> 01:15:27,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So, great.

1013
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:27,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus?

1014
01:15:27,827 --> 01:15:28,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Kid Icarus.

1015
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:28,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

1016
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:34,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I'll enjoy my three games for the next nine months or whatever it's going to take for Kid Icarus to come out.

1017
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:36,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's it.

1018
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:40,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Netflix 3D, that's what I'm looking forward to.

1019
01:15:40,052 --> 01:15:43,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what they bring to the table at E3.

1020
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:46,834
[SPEAKER_03]: But just remember this, and another thing.

1021
01:15:47,274 --> 01:15:49,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the other thing that'll make me happy, Nintendo.

1022
01:15:49,935 --> 01:15:50,415
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1023
01:16:19,772 --> 01:16:24,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce is being sued because, God, we love lawsuits this week.

1024
01:16:24,836 --> 01:16:26,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we seem to be reporting on.

1025
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:29,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce got sued for $100 million.

1026
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:30,900
[SPEAKER_04]: She probably has it.

1027
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:34,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce, even though her new single is terrible, just saying.

1028
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:38,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But Beyonce has been sued for $100 million from Gate 5.

1029
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:39,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is she being sued?

1030
01:16:39,766 --> 01:16:48,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's because the singer made this huge demand for more money during a crucial moment in the production of a game called Star Power Beyonce.

1031
01:16:49,532 --> 01:16:49,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1032
01:16:49,933 --> 01:16:52,174
[SPEAKER_04]: They were making a game called Star Power Beyonce.

1033
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:53,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what this game would have been.

1034
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:57,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine it must be like the Michael Jackson experience or something.

1035
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:57,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1036
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,000
[SPEAKER_06]: She shoots stars out of her cooch.

1037
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:04,464
[SPEAKER_04]: A music game that involves Beyonce where you could do the single ladies dance in the privacy of your own home.

1038
01:17:04,744 --> 01:17:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your hands up.

1039
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:15,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Gate 5 says we are entitled to the $6.7 million that we invested and the $100 million in profits that we would have made.

1040
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:22,550
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to let 70 employees go right at the Christmas season because of what Beyonce did.

1041
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:23,230
[SPEAKER_04]: What a Grinch.

1042
01:17:25,035 --> 01:17:37,459
[SPEAKER_04]: and they want an injunction against Beyonce from commercially associating with any other video game or using confidential information that she got when she was working with the company.

1043
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:39,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1044
01:18:00,874 --> 01:18:02,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe her people did, her entourage.

1045
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:03,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1046
01:18:03,495 --> 01:18:06,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jay-Z sat with her in those meetings.

1047
01:18:06,276 --> 01:18:06,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1048
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:10,157
[SPEAKER_06]: We now have a discussion going about people buying Beyonce cooch stars.

1049
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:13,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I would rather buy Gaga cooch stars.

1050
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:16,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't buy... How about all cooch stars?

1051
01:18:16,539 --> 01:18:18,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get all the crazy ladies.

1052
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,600
[SPEAKER_03]: A Beyonce game sounds dumb.

1053
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1054
01:18:20,621 --> 01:18:20,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It just...

1055
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:22,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have made money.

1056
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:25,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it wouldn't be like the biggest video game ever, but it would have made money.

1057
01:18:25,804 --> 01:18:26,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

1058
01:18:26,365 --> 01:18:35,912
[SPEAKER_03]: $100 million, I mean, that's way more than... If they were going to spend $100 million, or they spent $100 million on this game... No, they think $100 million is what they lost.

1059
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:37,753
[SPEAKER_04]: They lost... Oh, come on!

1060
01:18:38,554 --> 01:18:41,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have never made $100 million on this game.

1061
01:18:42,096 --> 01:18:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: That would require them selling... Let's just say it's a $50 retail game...

1062
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just say that it's all pure profit.

1063
01:18:49,762 --> 01:18:53,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because this is never going to, I mean, it would be way more than that.

1064
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:56,928
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have to sell more than 2 million copies of this game to make their money back.

1065
01:18:57,308 --> 01:19:02,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming that they were getting all of the money from the actual game sale, which they're not.

1066
01:19:02,352 --> 01:19:06,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they're saying that this game would have sold over 2 million copies.

1067
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:07,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have not sold over 2 million copies.

1068
01:19:07,936 --> 01:19:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have sold 200,000 copies at the most.

1069
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would have had to fire people anyway.

1070
01:19:14,561 --> 01:19:16,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So who cares?

1071
01:19:20,664 --> 01:19:26,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news, and then we're going to get to the release dates here in a little bit.

1072
01:19:27,048 --> 01:19:31,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to keep the show moving right along in what was a pretty hefty news week.

1073
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:36,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's going to be lots of phone calls tonight, so I want to keep some time open in Part B. So it's my turn?

1074
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:37,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, it's your turn.

1075
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Tron!

1076
01:19:39,595 --> 01:19:40,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to do the single ladies dance.

1077
01:19:41,516 --> 01:19:41,677
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1078
01:19:41,937 --> 01:19:42,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1079
01:19:43,755 --> 01:19:44,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Tron!

1080
01:19:45,116 --> 01:19:46,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what about Tron?

1081
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:48,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinball!

1082
01:19:48,498 --> 01:19:50,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, happy, happy, happy, happy.

1083
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I showed this to Dan, and he's like, what pinball tables can we get rid of to get this?

1084
01:19:57,382 --> 01:19:58,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually thinking that.

1085
01:19:58,263 --> 01:20:00,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, which pinball tables are you going to sell to buy the Tron pinball?

1086
01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:06,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, three of our tables would equal the cost of this, which is the problem.

1087
01:20:06,327 --> 01:20:07,067
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1088
01:20:07,267 --> 01:20:08,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should do it.

1089
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:11,970
[SPEAKER_06]: If it were my choice, I'd get rid of Lord of the Rings, but Dan loves that table, so...

1090
01:20:12,409 --> 01:20:17,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, yeah, Stern, which is like the only company doing tables anymore, is putting out Tron.

1091
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:31,336
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of doing just their usual teaser of the cabinet art, they've actually got the whole play field out, which I'm going to go ahead and link an image in the chat room for them to look at.

1092
01:20:31,856 --> 01:20:34,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But the pictures are up at arcadeheroes.com.

1093
01:20:34,437 --> 01:20:36,018
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually looking really good.

1094
01:20:36,638 --> 01:20:37,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got...

1095
01:20:38,859 --> 01:20:44,141
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D models in there, the light cycles, little figures in the back, plenty of ramps, plenty of lights.

1096
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're actually talking about doing a potentially limited edition where they might have something other than just those monochrome LED backgrounds.

1097
01:21:00,087 --> 01:21:01,908
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's still kind of speculation.

1098
01:21:04,769 --> 01:21:10,571
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool, but the back glass is supposed to have the 3D parallax effect that's the same on the Avatar pinball.

1099
01:21:11,352 --> 01:21:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be out sometime this month with a limited edition in June.

1100
01:21:16,374 --> 01:21:20,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks sick, and hopefully California Extreme will have one for us to play.

1101
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they had Iron Man last year.

1102
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:24,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh...

1103
01:21:25,818 --> 01:21:30,659
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, one of the other tables that Stern's doing, by the way, is the Rolling Stones, but it's like a $6,000 table.

1104
01:21:30,799 --> 01:21:31,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much is that table?

1105
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:34,280
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's going to be about $4,000, $4,500, something like that.

1106
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:34,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not bad.

1107
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:35,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez.

1108
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:48,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, Stern pretty much, and this is the problem I have with this, is that now that we don't have Williams and Midway doing tables anymore and Capcom's out of the game, Stern's really the only company there is.

1109
01:21:49,683 --> 01:21:50,604
[SPEAKER_03]: They can charge what they want.

1110
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:57,290
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the Williams Collection coming out on the 3DS in June, I think.

1111
01:21:57,951 --> 01:21:58,652
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

1112
01:21:59,312 --> 01:22:00,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the Williams Tables.

1113
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:04,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that game has been re-released so many damn times by Crave.

1114
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:08,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Crave closed down, but they're still making games.

1115
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:10,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Porting games.

1116
01:22:12,905 --> 01:22:13,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1117
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:17,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is my thing.

1118
01:22:17,377 --> 01:22:21,281
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I love video pinball, nothing compares to the real thing.

1119
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:29,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would almost always go out and hunt down a good pinball table than have... So you wouldn't be interested in a pin maim table?

1120
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:32,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a pin maim.

1121
01:22:32,552 --> 01:22:33,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1122
01:22:33,793 --> 01:22:36,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun, but not my thing.

1123
01:22:37,756 --> 01:23:04,183
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll tell you what I did because a few years ago they had one at California Extreme and right next to it was a Black Knight 2000 and I played Black Knight 2000 on the pin maim and then I played Black Knight 2000 on the real thing and it's just you just can't get the same feel it's a very good simulacrum I mean pin maim itself is very well done but it's just not the same

1124
01:23:05,153 --> 01:23:30,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go ahead, I can't remember very often in the history of our show that we do this but there is a real world that goes on out there outside of us and not just what's happening in the world of video games and if you are all about 100% video games I do encourage you to go outside once in a while but needless to say there's a lot going on in the real world right now they are saying that President Obama is scheduled to address the nation any minute now I guess it's supposed to happen at 10.30 Eastern but it's running a little late

1125
01:23:31,194 --> 01:23:50,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I take this with a grain of salt we'll find out in the next few minutes I'm looking at what is usually a pretty respectable source it does sound like Osama Bin Laden is dead and the US has the body and that's what Obama is expected to announce in the next few minutes that is not confirmed I'm getting that from a source that's usually pretty right on about these things

1126
01:23:51,268 --> 01:23:52,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So more to develop.

1127
01:23:52,109 --> 01:23:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do encourage you, if you are listening to the show, you might just want to keep CNN open in another tab and furiously hit refresh on that.

1128
01:23:57,971 --> 01:24:03,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if that is the news, that's obviously going to have people talking about more than just games for quite some time.

1129
01:24:04,274 --> 01:24:09,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he invites in the guy from the announcer from NBA Jam.

1130
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom shakalaka!

1131
01:24:12,378 --> 01:24:18,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you, by the way, not meaning to really derail so much, but did you see the White House correspondent speech?

1132
01:24:18,627 --> 01:24:18,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

1133
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:20,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That was brilliant.

1134
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:20,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.

1135
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:21,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that man.

1136
01:24:22,272 --> 01:24:22,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time.

1137
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:24,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I voted for him.

1138
01:24:25,256 --> 01:24:26,358
[SPEAKER_06]: His sense of humor is amazing.

1139
01:24:27,272 --> 01:24:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, again, I just know where to look for information and rumors that are usually right on Hold on, hold on Let me just put a funny, maybe morbid image in your face Wouldn't it be hilarious if they just pulled a whole fucking Weekend at Bernie's Oh, stop it

1140
01:24:46,743 --> 01:24:49,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Hassan Bin Laden waving his hand.

1141
01:24:50,204 --> 01:24:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1142
01:24:51,705 --> 01:24:52,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1143
01:24:52,265 --> 01:24:52,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

1144
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:59,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby actually gave me the original tip on that, so thank you, Bobby, who told me to go look at CNN, and that made me think to go check my tweet.

1145
01:24:59,267 --> 01:25:08,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, again, not official, but my guy on Twitter who tends to be on top of this stuff is rolling out all these sources that seem to point to that being the case.

1146
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:10,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that would be interesting.

1147
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:13,433
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be extremely interesting, to say the least.

1148
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:20,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the show must go on as they say, but I do know we live in a multitask world, so those of you listening live may wish to alt-tab to CNN.

1149
01:25:21,377 --> 01:25:24,179
[SPEAKER_04]: But please don't turn us off.

1150
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: If they confirm it or whatever it is, I will relay it for you guys.

1151
01:25:29,002 --> 01:25:30,683
[SPEAKER_06]: How about I keep the website up and I'll keep an eye on it?

1152
01:25:30,743 --> 01:25:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1153
01:25:31,303 --> 01:25:32,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1154
01:25:32,424 --> 01:25:37,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, let's talk about release dates and what is coming soon to a gaming store near you.

1155
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:47,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, these games may not be able to be played by Osama Bin Laden very soon, but coming next week, Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska for the Nintendo Wii.

1156
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:52,898
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like your hunting, and you like your Alaska hunting, and you like your Sarah Palin, but she's not in the game.

1157
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:56,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't hunt her either, so I don't know.

1158
01:25:56,641 --> 01:25:59,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's budget price, so I guess that might be good.

1159
01:26:00,584 --> 01:26:04,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Thor, God of Thunder, or God of Movie Titan Game.

1160
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:06,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and

1161
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:11,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii, DS, and that's it.

1162
01:26:12,413 --> 01:26:13,434
[SPEAKER_03]: No 3DS, unfortunately.

1163
01:26:13,454 --> 01:26:14,074
[SPEAKER_03]: That got delayed.

1164
01:26:14,915 --> 01:26:17,476
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think it'd be easy to port over.

1165
01:26:17,737 --> 01:26:29,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the game that I've been highly raving about, and I, sadly enough, haven't been playing much of it lately, just for no reason whatsoever, but Motorstorm Apocalypse, coming out on PlayStation 3.

1166
01:26:29,905 --> 01:26:36,809
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like racing games and you like crazy destruction and just all sorts of insane stuff going on while you're racing,

1167
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:39,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, go pick this game up.

1168
01:26:39,313 --> 01:26:40,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just amazing.

1169
01:26:41,398 --> 01:26:42,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming on PlayStation 3 this week.

1170
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:47,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, that is it.

1171
01:26:48,849 --> 01:26:49,489
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all.

1172
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:54,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff for the rest of May, though, but just unfortunately next week is a little light.

1173
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:57,232
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some other highlights in May, just so I know what I should be looking at?

1174
01:26:57,332 --> 01:27:03,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in two weeks, we have Brink, which is going to be an awesome first-person shooter from Bethesda.

1175
01:27:03,794 --> 01:27:04,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out.

1176
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Lego Pirates, if you're into that kind of thing.

1177
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:10,756
[SPEAKER_03]: MX vs. HV Alive, if you like that.

1178
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two weeks, the game I'm looking forward to, L.A.

1179
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:15,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire from Rockstar Games coming out.

1180
01:27:15,818 --> 01:27:17,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's quite a few people looking forward to that.

1181
01:27:17,618 --> 01:27:18,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be awesome.

1182
01:27:19,019 --> 01:27:29,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, towards the end of the month, if you're a big fan of racing, Dirt 3 coming out and Hunt of the Demon's Forge if you're into those types of games.

1183
01:27:30,587 --> 01:27:36,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, actually a lot of stuff that was supposed to be coming out in the month, Fear 3, Dungeon Siege 3, and Red Faction all got delayed to June.

1184
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:40,154
[SPEAKER_03]: But Red Faction looks pretty good too, although it's kind of got a Dead Space vibe.

1185
01:27:41,114 --> 01:27:41,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1186
01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:44,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really feeling Dead Space, so...

1187
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:45,378
[SPEAKER_03]: but L.A.

1188
01:27:45,438 --> 01:27:49,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire looks awesome so that's probably the next game I'll pick up and maybe Brink.

1189
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:50,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Brink looks pretty cool too.

1190
01:27:51,343 --> 01:27:53,203
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1191
01:28:16,283 --> 01:28:43,535
[SPEAKER_04]: there is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week that's it that's the releases May 12th, Steel Diver on the 3DS which we've had here obviously since release Major League Baseball on the 12th but as far as the 5th which the games are usually out on Fridays nothing wow it could be that all that's going on in the world as far as Japan is maybe shuffled some things up I mean it's, don't know

1192
01:28:43,837 --> 01:28:44,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly.

1193
01:28:44,697 --> 01:28:46,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a few releases for the UK.

1194
01:28:47,058 --> 01:28:49,799
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 4th is Bangaio HD Missile Fury for Xbox 360.

1195
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Bangaio is so much fun.

1196
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's Section 8 Prejudice for PC.

1197
01:28:55,121 --> 01:29:01,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the 6th is Sniper Ghost Warriors, Steel Diver, and Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011.

1198
01:29:01,623 --> 01:29:03,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Eww.

1199
01:29:05,205 --> 01:29:06,065
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I say about that.

1200
01:29:08,715 --> 01:29:10,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, so much for release dates.

1201
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:12,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking a little dry no matter what part of the world you're in.

1202
01:29:13,096 --> 01:29:13,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go to Loki.

1203
01:29:14,497 --> 01:29:21,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, there's some interest... Oh my god, the chat room is yelling at me because I said the release dates are looking pretty dry in Japan.

1204
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:23,760
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are dummies.

1205
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1206
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that with love, but seriously.

1207
01:29:26,602 --> 01:29:27,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

1208
01:29:28,204 --> 01:29:32,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony revealed two new tablet devices that are going to be part of the PlayStation suite.

1209
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:40,395
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, I guess they're officially the S1 and S2 tablets, which...

1210
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,677
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1211
01:30:04,568 --> 01:30:09,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dual screen tablet and people are saying it looks like the DS.

1212
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:13,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can run two different things at the same time.

1213
01:30:13,933 --> 01:30:21,178
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch a video and chat at the same time on the other screen or use the other screen as a soft keyboard and whatever.

1214
01:30:21,778 --> 01:30:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're two 5.5 inch screens and both of course will be able to play select PlayStation 1 games.

1215
01:30:29,162 --> 01:30:29,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangible buttons?

1216
01:30:30,323 --> 01:30:31,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, couldn't care less.

1217
01:30:31,804 --> 01:30:32,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1218
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm not interested unless they were to have tangible buttons.

1219
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:41,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine playing a PlayStation 1 game on your iPhone?

1220
01:30:41,555 --> 01:30:43,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what this is, basically.

1221
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:45,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

1222
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:47,802
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1223
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:51,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

1224
01:30:51,865 --> 01:30:56,409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also kind of a follow-up because last week in the middle of the show, some details were breaking on it.

1225
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:57,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess it was really that day.

1226
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:00,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantasy Star Online 2 details.

1227
01:31:00,953 --> 01:31:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting some more information on what that was all about.

1228
01:31:03,855 --> 01:31:09,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a PSP2 promotion event that was in Akihabara over last week.

1229
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:10,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1230
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:15,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, there was more information released on Phantasy Star Online 2.

1231
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:19,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently now you're going to be able to jump in the game.

1232
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:27,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, randomly generated hunting areas, some third-person shooter-style gameplay, and so on.

1233
01:31:27,528 --> 01:31:29,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're adding jumping into it.

1234
01:31:29,168 --> 01:31:31,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That could certainly make the levels different.

1235
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:33,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Randomly generated hunting areas.

1236
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,271
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I seem to remember the levels in the old...

1237
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just said National Journal learned it's true

1238
01:32:05,316 --> 01:32:10,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, yeah, according to MSNBC, their same president will make a statement soon regarding Osama bin Laden.

1239
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:14,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Fox News saying it, New York Times is saying it, so it looks like, there you go.

1240
01:32:15,383 --> 01:32:15,643
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1241
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:16,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

1242
01:32:16,924 --> 01:32:20,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to, again, keep CNN open in another tab.

1243
01:32:21,407 --> 01:32:22,768
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, if you're listening to the show.

1244
01:32:23,108 --> 01:32:27,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever, I say CNN, but whatever your website of choice is, okay, kids?

1245
01:32:27,651 --> 01:32:29,552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, tell us about what is the classic game of the week.

1246
01:32:53,564 --> 01:32:57,666
[SPEAKER_06]: The game of the week is Afterburner, which came out in 1987.

1247
01:32:57,766 --> 01:33:01,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a flight sim arcade game put out by Sega.

1248
01:33:01,948 --> 01:33:06,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It had full motion seats, at least for the deluxe cabinet.

1249
01:33:06,951 --> 01:33:09,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also designed by Yu Suzuki, who is the man!

1250
01:33:10,813 --> 01:33:20,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, you control an F-14 Tomcat, and you go through 18 stages, and you take off from an aircraft character called the Sega Enterprise.

1251
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:46,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is an homage to Top Gun and not Star Trek And so it had basically an integrated flight stick That would control the way the cabinet moved either back and forth And it had hydraulics in it And it would have cannon and missile buttons It was also a standing upright one But the rotating cockpit one was the awesome one

1252
01:33:47,632 --> 01:33:53,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, it was, I mean, basically it's just straightforward.

1253
01:33:53,338 --> 01:34:01,266
[SPEAKER_06]: You shoot down planes and you have like a lock for your missiles and you can shoot them down and you choose, you know, your direction.

1254
01:34:01,346 --> 01:34:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also After Burner 2, which was a sequel that was put out the same year.

1255
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:34,135
[SPEAKER_06]: and then there were other games that focused on the F-14 Tomcat like G-Lock Air Battle and Strike Fighter that was actually rebranded as After Burner 3 and then Sky Target there was also Sega Strike Fighter which was a free roaming type of F-14 game and then we got After Burner Climax which is the one that I played just this week that's really sweet there's also a PSP release called After Burner Black Falcon

1256
01:34:35,478 --> 01:34:39,875
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually some of the music in this was remixed for Bayonetta.

1257
01:34:41,388 --> 01:34:41,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

1258
01:34:42,669 --> 01:34:55,254
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as other versions that have been out, there was Amiga, the Amstrad, the Atari ST, Sharp X68000, FM Towns, Commodore 64, NES, Sega Master System, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, PC, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.

1259
01:34:55,895 --> 01:35:02,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was a 32X version that was called Afterburner Complete in Japan and Europe.

1260
01:35:02,378 --> 01:35:04,059
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you what's cool about that.

1261
01:35:04,099 --> 01:35:06,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It also is the same for Space Harrier on 32X.

1262
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:08,941
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the arcade version, the full arcade version.

1263
01:35:09,341 --> 01:35:11,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually do a little trick to make it say insert coin.

1264
01:35:13,027 --> 01:35:15,130
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so it's kind of neat.

1265
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:16,432
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much the same ROM.

1266
01:35:17,153 --> 01:35:25,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And the little article here has a few other bits and pieces, like in Terminator 2 Judgment Day, John Connor's playing Afterburner.

1267
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:28,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

1268
01:35:28,383 --> 01:35:29,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

1269
01:35:29,104 --> 01:35:29,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he is.

1270
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:34,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Red Dwarf, seasons two and three, there was an afterburner in the bar area.

1271
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:38,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty cool.

1272
01:35:39,217 --> 01:35:39,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1273
01:35:40,499 --> 01:35:41,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the music in this game.

1274
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really surprised you've never done afterburner before.

1275
01:35:45,498 --> 01:35:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and After Burner, I have to say, is not one of my favorite games.

1276
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:51,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love After Burner Climax.

1277
01:35:51,182 --> 01:35:52,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the cabinet.

1278
01:35:52,523 --> 01:35:53,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the cabinet.

1279
01:35:53,524 --> 01:36:00,249
[SPEAKER_06]: After Burner Climax actually has the full-on hydraulic seats that has front, back, side, up, down motion.

1280
01:36:00,429 --> 01:36:02,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's super, super fun.

1281
01:36:02,911 --> 01:36:07,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that was really great about these is that they did include a motion stop.

1282
01:36:07,354 --> 01:36:09,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you couldn't take it, it would just stop the movement.

1283
01:36:10,656 --> 01:36:11,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

1284
01:36:11,717 --> 01:36:12,718
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, After Burner...

1285
01:36:14,429 --> 01:36:19,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, everybody, Afterburner.

1286
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:24,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Best known in its arcade release, but certainly ported to plenty of home consoles.

1287
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:28,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1288
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1289
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,541
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be right back with plenty more of the show tonight.

1290
01:36:32,322 --> 01:36:35,923
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking a lot about PlayStation, but there's been big news on Xbox this week as well.

1291
01:36:35,943 --> 01:36:37,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk about that as well.

1292
01:36:37,844 --> 01:36:39,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 3DS news as well.

1293
01:36:39,345 --> 01:36:40,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki's going to bring us some hacking news.

1294
01:36:41,346 --> 01:36:44,788
[SPEAKER_04]: All when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1295
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1296
01:36:53,742 --> 01:37:07,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this Sunday evening, May the 1st of 2011, with the 411th episode of our show, where we're giving you not just the 411 on what's going on with PSN and all that stuff, but apparently what's going on in the real world as well.

1297
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:17,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite an exciting evening, but in the interest of those that are... We'll keep you abreast if anything huge develops, but in the interest of those that listen to the podcast throughout the week, by the time this will be...

1298
01:37:20,045 --> 01:37:27,088
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one little announcement that's going to be closer to 11.30 Central Time that the announcement will be made.

1299
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:28,569
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still working on final statements.

1300
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:29,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1301
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:35,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything's set up, so that will be 9.30 Pacific for our live listeners.

1302
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:36,593
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1303
01:37:36,913 --> 01:37:38,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on, though, with the show.

1304
01:37:38,414 --> 01:37:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get back into video games, especially out of the interest of those that listen to the show throughout the week by the time this will be long reported on.

1305
01:37:44,077 --> 01:37:45,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to name my firstborn Wolf.

1306
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:46,841
[SPEAKER_04]: After Wolf Blitzer?

1307
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because Wolf was a freaking badass name.

1308
01:37:49,384 --> 01:37:51,867
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the name of the dog that played piano on the Muppets?

1309
01:37:51,887 --> 01:37:52,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that Ralph?

1310
01:37:52,488 --> 01:37:52,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Ralph.

1311
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:53,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1312
01:37:53,449 --> 01:37:53,970
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Wolf.

1313
01:37:55,172 --> 01:37:56,373
[SPEAKER_04]: How about, what if you have twins?

1314
01:37:56,413 --> 01:37:57,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you have Wolf and Ralph?

1315
01:37:58,796 --> 01:38:00,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have Wolf and...

1316
01:38:02,398 --> 01:38:03,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolf and Fox.

1317
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:03,799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1318
01:38:04,279 --> 01:38:05,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on back into the show.

1319
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,440
[SPEAKER_04]: First, spin-off shows.

1320
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,322
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Orange Launch Radio, there's some other shows you might like as well.

1321
01:38:11,142 --> 01:38:11,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I do one.

1322
01:38:11,742 --> 01:38:13,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

1323
01:38:14,283 --> 01:38:16,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a show about all things World of Warcraft.

1324
01:38:16,084 --> 01:38:16,904
[SPEAKER_04]: This week was a fun week.

1325
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It was our international edition.

1326
01:38:18,465 --> 01:38:24,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this gal, Syl, from the Girls Gone Wow podcast, and she is a Dutch lady living in the U.K.

1327
01:38:25,328 --> 01:38:27,869
[SPEAKER_04]: She's Southwest, I think Southwest part of the U.K.

1328
01:38:28,189 --> 01:38:29,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you use the underwear picture.

1329
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,762
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1330
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:46,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcane is awesome!

1331
01:39:11,476 --> 01:39:11,737
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1332
01:39:12,037 --> 01:39:15,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, you want to hear more WoW geekery, check it out, HordeHouse.com.

1333
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you got a show.

1334
01:39:16,841 --> 01:39:24,947
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it Comic Insanity, although we haven't done one for a month now because we've just had a lot of stuff going on and the world of comics is not that much exciting.

1335
01:39:25,007 --> 01:39:29,110
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

1336
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:32,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should have a new one, I think, next week.

1337
01:39:32,252 --> 01:39:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep your eyes open on the website.

1338
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:36,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pretty cool.

1339
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I do it with Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

1340
01:39:40,895 --> 01:39:41,884
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're cool!

1341
01:39:43,346 --> 01:39:43,726
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1342
01:39:44,047 --> 01:39:45,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually came back this week?

1343
01:39:45,968 --> 01:39:47,770
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we didn't because she's in Disneyland.

1344
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:49,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1345
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going.

1346
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:52,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean that babe in total control of herself.

1347
01:39:52,134 --> 01:39:52,654
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going.

1348
01:39:52,734 --> 01:39:52,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1349
01:39:53,034 --> 01:39:55,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's for her birthday.

1350
01:39:55,316 --> 01:40:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about this how openly, but there's like this awesome Disneyland trip happening very soon.

1351
01:40:00,941 --> 01:40:02,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not very soon, but soon.

1352
01:40:02,602 --> 01:40:05,305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to involve at least one other person not in this room.

1353
01:40:05,805 --> 01:40:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be epic epicness.

1354
01:40:07,827 --> 01:40:09,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So more to come on that later.

1355
01:40:09,889 --> 01:40:10,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1356
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1357
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing?

1358
01:40:13,252 --> 01:40:13,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1359
01:40:28,775 --> 01:40:29,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1360
01:40:29,596 --> 01:40:29,876
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1361
01:40:30,016 --> 01:40:32,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we wouldn't be announcing it if we didn't do it ourselves.

1362
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,383
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd say, yeah, those guys in the UK.

1363
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:42,649
[SPEAKER_04]: We can end the show early if you guys just want to focus on this.

1364
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:49,997
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I realize it's important news, but I'm worried about the podcasties listening throughout the week who have probably heard this a million times by now.

1365
01:40:50,337 --> 01:40:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1366
01:40:53,220 --> 01:41:00,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Redbox is now finally rolling out game rentals for all of their kiosks.

1367
01:41:00,726 --> 01:41:01,967
[SPEAKER_03]: $21,000 to be exact.

1368
01:41:02,007 --> 01:41:04,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not exact, but I guess that's kind of an estimate.

1369
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting June 17th.

1370
01:41:08,453 --> 01:41:10,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Those rentals will run you $2 a day.

1371
01:41:11,175 --> 01:41:17,200
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be, I guess, including some of the top AAA games and some family games as well.

1372
01:41:19,383 --> 01:41:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's pretty awesome.

1373
01:41:20,444 --> 01:41:30,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking for another place to rent games, and maybe just game flies and getting stuff to you quick enough, you can check out a Redbox machine, which are everywhere now.

1374
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:43,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Smiles 2X has been rated by the ESRB, and of course, we can probably expect that on the Xbox 360 Marketplace very soon.

1375
01:41:43,339 --> 01:41:48,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they've been putting a lot of other cave shmup games on there, so...

1376
01:41:50,268 --> 01:41:50,648
[SPEAKER_03]: E.A.

1377
01:41:50,668 --> 01:41:51,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackbox is the one doing the game.

1378
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:46,583
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're saying that apparently it will be kind of a cross country cannonball run style game from San Francisco to New York and not only will you be racing against police and what not but you'll also be racing through dense urban traffic, icy mountain passes and narrow canyons so kind of a little bit of you versus the elements versus police and stuff so sounds pretty chaotic, might be fun and that'll be coming out this fall

1379
01:42:48,254 --> 01:42:51,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did you hear the one about Marshfield, Massachusetts?

1380
01:42:51,257 --> 01:42:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're probably like, what?

1381
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:53,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you live there.

1382
01:42:54,179 --> 01:43:01,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1982, they actually banned arcade games from public establishments.

1383
01:43:01,945 --> 01:43:02,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1384
01:43:02,386 --> 01:43:07,030
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to have a coin-op game in an establishment in Marshfield, Massachusetts.

1385
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Footloose for video games.

1386
01:43:09,292 --> 01:43:09,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

1387
01:43:10,352 --> 01:43:15,797
[SPEAKER_04]: The law was actually upheld once by the state Supreme Court the next year, and it's always been in place since then.

1388
01:43:16,638 --> 01:43:24,764
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they might actually be, and the reason why this is relevant now, 29 years later, is that they are looking at possibly reversing that law.

1389
01:43:25,605 --> 01:43:32,371
[SPEAKER_04]: State law actually permits Keno to be allowed in bars and other buildings, so what the hell's wrong with coin-op games existing?

1390
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:59,181
[SPEAKER_04]: the town meeting is happening this next week and voters will be able to overturn the law so it'll be up to the voters so if you know anyone there you probably want to get them to vote to overturn this law although at the same time I suppose if they've gotten by for 29 years without coin-op games in town they'll probably get by another 29 there's also that part of me that says what coin-op games because you know outside of the Tron pinball news we had earlier there's not a lot of games going on

1391
01:43:59,841 --> 01:44:04,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, a game that's rumored to be coming out on the Kinect, Fruit Ninja.

1392
01:44:04,143 --> 01:44:07,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very popular game, of course, on the iPhone and iPad devices.

1393
01:44:08,184 --> 01:44:12,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit Ninja Kinect is apparently a game that's just recently been rated in Korea.

1394
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:15,727
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not usually the country we get our rating board leaks from, but...

1395
01:44:16,427 --> 01:44:17,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It is what it is.

1396
01:44:17,127 --> 01:44:21,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit Ninja Connect has been leaked as a rated game in Korea.

1397
01:44:23,008 --> 01:44:25,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they don't say what system this is for.

1398
01:44:25,569 --> 01:44:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the 360, but they don't say if it's a disc game or an Xbox Live Arcade game or how it's being delivered.

1399
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:39,852
[SPEAKER_04]: My assumption is that it's going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game just based on what the source material is, but we won't know for a little while.

1400
01:44:41,112 --> 01:44:43,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one other piece of the thing came to light this week.

1401
01:44:43,693 --> 01:44:50,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there was a Sonic skateboarding game that went unreleased during the Xbox era.

1402
01:44:51,457 --> 01:44:56,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It was discovered by a post on the Sonic Retro fan site at sonicretro.org.

1403
01:44:57,239 --> 01:44:58,120
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1404
01:45:27,217 --> 01:45:30,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to some more rapid fire news.

1405
01:45:30,493 --> 01:45:31,016
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1406
01:45:33,908 --> 01:45:37,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have some news for fans of Black Ops.

1407
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:46,776
[SPEAKER_06]: There is going to be a download content pack called Call of the Dead that has George Romero as himself.

1408
01:45:47,836 --> 01:45:51,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's lots of zombie fan service.

1409
01:45:51,419 --> 01:45:54,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be making the dead go splat.

1410
01:45:56,202 --> 01:45:58,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be pretty neat.

1411
01:46:00,237 --> 01:46:05,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have BlazBlue shirts that are going for Japan relief.

1412
01:46:06,842 --> 01:46:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Axis Games has everything on sale and I will put a link to that in the chat room.

1413
01:46:12,466 --> 01:46:20,332
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to do your part, go to AxisGames.com slash 2011 slash 03 slash 16 slash Japan dash benefit dash sale.

1414
01:46:20,632 --> 01:46:25,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can probably find a link from the website, but I am being nice and telling you the whole thing.

1415
01:46:26,336 --> 01:46:33,118
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Rock Band has some cool bean stuff coming up including some Culture Club downloads.

1416
01:46:33,798 --> 01:46:36,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me get what's on the list for you.

1417
01:46:37,379 --> 01:46:39,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be of course Xbox 360, Wii and PS3.

1418
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:54,945
[SPEAKER_06]: The individual songs are going to be Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, From Out of Nowhere by Faith No More, Working for the Weekend by Loverboy, Stashed by Fish, Tweezer by Fish and Big Bang Baby by Stone Temple Pilots.

1419
01:46:56,166 --> 01:47:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: and that last one and Working for the Weekend also have pro guitar bass expansions available.

1420
01:47:02,235 --> 01:47:03,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and so does Stashed by Phish.

1421
01:47:04,078 --> 01:47:04,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Phish is cool.

1422
01:47:05,981 --> 01:47:07,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yay.

1423
01:47:09,528 --> 01:47:09,888
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1424
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:14,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick to kind of add on a little bit what you were saying about the Call of Duty expansion.

1425
01:47:15,092 --> 01:47:22,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does it have George Romero, he is playing this crazy uber zombie in it, but it also has Sarah Jessica Parker.

1426
01:47:22,797 --> 01:47:23,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah Michelle Gellar.

1427
01:47:23,778 --> 01:47:24,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1428
01:47:24,178 --> 01:47:27,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be, that's way better than Sarah Michelle Parker.

1429
01:47:28,981 --> 01:47:32,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah Jessica Parker would probably, she'd be like a plastic zombie.

1430
01:47:32,423 --> 01:47:33,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a plastic zombie.

1431
01:47:33,544 --> 01:47:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Michael Rooker, Danny Trejo, and Robert England,

1432
01:47:39,948 --> 01:48:03,253
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah all kind of almost like playing themselves you know like they've got you know Robert Englund has kind of like some catchphrases that sort of you know hint at you know Nightmare on Elm Street and he has a pitchfork and then Danny Trejo has a machete and Microworker kind of looks like a biker so looks pretty neat

1433
01:48:05,686 --> 01:48:05,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1434
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:08,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on to some Twitter topics.

1435
01:48:08,747 --> 01:48:12,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1436
01:48:12,809 --> 01:48:13,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1437
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys send us your tweets and we read them live here on the show.

1438
01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the first tweet tonight from Redertainment tweets us saying, I like putting corn on my tacks.

1439
01:48:26,355 --> 01:48:27,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this weird?

1440
01:48:28,274 --> 01:48:30,796
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S tweets us and says, Hey, what's your definition of shovelware?

1441
01:48:58,072 --> 01:48:58,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.

1442
01:48:58,652 --> 01:48:59,993
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your definition of shovelware?

1443
01:49:00,353 --> 01:49:06,797
[SPEAKER_04]: My definition of shovelware is a game that is so blatant in copying another game you just can't even tell.

1444
01:49:08,338 --> 01:49:14,922
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, very rushed game that is put out for the sole purpose of capitalizing on what's popular.

1445
01:49:16,323 --> 01:49:18,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, Loki, anything you guys want to add to that?

1446
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:22,567
[SPEAKER_03]: A game with next to none production values.

1447
01:49:22,907 --> 01:49:24,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just looks like crap.

1448
01:49:24,448 --> 01:49:25,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's broken in it.

1449
01:49:25,709 --> 01:49:27,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... Think of a ditch.

1450
01:49:29,467 --> 01:49:30,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely useless.

1451
01:49:31,289 --> 01:49:33,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You shun your friends for buying it.

1452
01:49:34,311 --> 01:49:36,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there nutritional value in dirt?

1453
01:49:37,514 --> 01:49:37,714
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1454
01:49:38,675 --> 01:49:40,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither is there any entertainment value in shovel war.

1455
01:49:44,059 --> 01:49:45,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see.

1456
01:49:46,001 --> 01:49:46,742
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more tweets.

1457
01:49:46,802 --> 01:49:47,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

1458
01:49:47,322 --> 01:49:49,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Swim is tweeting us saying, Shit!

1459
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:51,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1460
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1461
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:52,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

1462
01:49:52,492 --> 01:49:54,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki talked about what I was going to call OLR about.

1463
01:49:55,056 --> 01:49:56,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to rethink my call.

1464
01:49:56,979 --> 01:50:00,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you could call in and just be a Loki fan and just be like, yeah, I agree with you, man.

1465
01:50:01,365 --> 01:50:03,087
[SPEAKER_04]: On second thought, let's not inflate his ego anymore.

1466
01:50:03,488 --> 01:50:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1467
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Other tweets.

1468
01:50:05,991 --> 01:50:06,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is one.

1469
01:50:06,893 --> 01:50:07,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1470
01:50:07,233 --> 01:50:07,273
[SPEAKER_04]: D.C.

1471
01:50:07,353 --> 01:50:07,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Universe

1472
01:50:22,861 --> 01:50:24,743
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is being developed by Secret Identity.

1473
01:50:25,824 --> 01:50:28,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a team that was specifically assembled to make the MMO.

1474
01:50:29,007 --> 01:50:31,609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a free-to-play MMO.

1475
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:32,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that.

1476
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:34,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Universe is going to be free.

1477
01:50:34,532 --> 01:50:35,873
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, any interest in that?

1478
01:50:35,913 --> 01:50:37,274
[SPEAKER_04]: A free-to-play Marvel MMO?

1479
01:50:37,514 --> 01:50:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be all over that.

1480
01:50:38,936 --> 01:50:39,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a freemium?

1481
01:50:40,617 --> 01:50:41,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm assuming it has to be.

1482
01:50:41,918 --> 01:50:43,099
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's free-to-play, it's freemium.

1483
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:43,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1484
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:44,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But

1485
01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:58,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've actually remembered reading something about this, because I follow Agent M on Twitter, and apparently, I think he said it, or somebody with Marvel said it, that Bendis has a hand in the writing, so that's pretty cool.

1486
01:50:58,726 --> 01:51:01,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctor Doom is going to be the antagonist, at least in the launch of the game.

1487
01:51:01,967 --> 01:51:04,728
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that you will be able to play as famous Marvel heroes.

1488
01:51:04,848 --> 01:51:09,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Nova, and Squirrel Girl.

1489
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Squirrel Girl is awesome!

1490
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:12,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

1491
01:51:12,691 --> 01:51:18,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if everybody's the hero, so there must be like an instance thing or maybe kind of what they do in DC Universe where it's PvP.

1492
01:51:18,812 --> 01:51:20,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I would want to play as Jessica Jones.

1493
01:51:20,813 --> 01:51:21,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious.

1494
01:51:22,653 --> 01:51:24,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian Michael Bendis is doing some writing for the game.

1495
01:51:25,174 --> 01:51:25,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1496
01:51:25,954 --> 01:51:28,435
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's story missions are taken from the comic themselves.

1497
01:51:28,855 --> 01:51:29,356
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

1498
01:51:50,314 --> 01:51:52,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is Squirrel Girl for the uninitiated?

1499
01:51:52,035 --> 01:52:11,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Squirrel Girl, her mutant power is basically being an anthropomorphic squirrel and she can talk telepathically, oh, she can talk to squirrels and understand their language, but the thing is that she's actually defeated Doctor Doom and Thanos, the real thing, by the way, and all kinds of just bad guys and also kicked Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Avengers mansion and told him to shut his evil, evil pie hole.

1500
01:52:13,024 --> 01:52:13,625
[SPEAKER_06]: She's super fun.

1501
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:15,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, right now, she's the babysitter.

1502
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:19,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess nanny slash babysitter for Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's baby.

1503
01:52:19,410 --> 01:52:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: The nanny.

1504
01:52:23,014 --> 01:52:23,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Sheffield.

1505
01:52:24,255 --> 01:52:30,000
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I like some of the cheeseball characters, and she's cheeseball, but actually cheeseball in a fun way.

1506
01:52:30,521 --> 01:52:33,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have a character in Marvel Universe that's the nanny as a superhero.

1507
01:52:34,841 --> 01:52:40,970
[SPEAKER_06]: There actually was a bad guy who was a nanny and orphan maker.

1508
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:42,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Or super nanny.

1509
01:52:42,392 --> 01:52:44,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been very, very naughty.

1510
01:52:44,315 --> 01:52:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you need to go to the naughty corner.

1511
01:52:47,019 --> 01:52:48,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nanny and orphan maker.

1512
01:52:49,488 --> 01:52:50,229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

1513
01:52:50,689 --> 01:52:51,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know my obscure.

1514
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:54,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Another tweet from Tiger Claw.

1515
01:52:55,372 --> 01:53:01,417
[SPEAKER_04]: This show started off so well, and then there's this stuff going on in the real world, and now it's just, oh, who cares anymore.

1516
01:53:01,717 --> 01:53:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1517
01:53:03,298 --> 01:53:04,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Another tweet from Tiger Claw.

1518
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about L.A.

1519
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

1520
01:53:07,822 --> 01:53:09,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's a social club for this.

1521
01:53:10,464 --> 01:53:10,824
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

1522
01:53:10,904 --> 01:53:11,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this on Facebook or something?

1523
01:53:11,945 --> 01:53:13,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rockstar Social Club.

1524
01:53:13,866 --> 01:53:15,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a website thing that they have.

1525
01:53:15,368 --> 01:53:16,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tied in with all Rockstar games.

1526
01:53:16,989 --> 01:53:17,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1527
01:53:17,489 --> 01:53:21,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you get through the whole thing, you get an exclusive outfit for the game.

1528
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:24,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's an incentive to get in on that thing.

1529
01:53:24,371 --> 01:53:24,931
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into that.

1530
01:53:25,452 --> 01:53:27,352
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into the Barbie doll stuff in your video games.

1531
01:53:27,432 --> 01:53:28,553
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Social Club's pretty fun.

1532
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:30,853
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a bunch of stuff with Grand Theft Auto like they did.

1533
01:53:31,714 --> 01:53:36,995
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the leaderboards for multiplayer, which I paid attention to a lot for a while.

1534
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:42,397
[SPEAKER_03]: They had things like the Grand Theft... It was the Liberty City Marathon where they tracked how long...

1535
01:53:42,857 --> 01:53:47,481
[SPEAKER_03]: How far you ran, how far you drove, how many bullets you spent, that kind of stuff.

1536
01:53:47,941 --> 01:53:49,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do a bunch of different things.

1537
01:53:49,262 --> 01:53:51,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also they do stuff with Red Dead Redemption.

1538
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:57,729
[SPEAKER_03]: They have little challenges that you do and you unlock skins and stuff like that through those challenges.

1539
01:53:57,849 --> 01:53:58,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

1540
01:54:00,466 --> 01:54:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the costume you're going to unlock on the social club, if you're a member, the Chicago Lightning Suit.

1541
01:54:05,728 --> 01:54:08,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the protagonist, Cole Phillips, in the game.

1542
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:13,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're online, you get to access the Ask the Community feature in-game.

1543
01:54:14,032 --> 01:54:20,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're interrogating a suspect, you don't know if they're telling the truth or not, you can see how other players responded in the same situation.

1544
01:54:20,614 --> 01:54:22,735
[SPEAKER_04]: They're calling it a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

1545
01:54:22,855 --> 01:54:23,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask the Audience Lifeline.

1546
01:54:24,796 --> 01:54:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of crazy.

1547
01:54:25,957 --> 01:54:28,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that kind of idea for games, though.

1548
01:54:28,358 --> 01:54:41,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they had a thing come out about that game as well, where if you were having trouble in certain spots and whatnot, you could actually bypass some of the action sequences in the game.

1549
01:54:42,027 --> 01:54:49,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you keep failing over and over and over again, you can just skip past it and get back to the narrative stuff, which is kind of unique.

1550
01:54:51,816 --> 01:54:52,177
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1551
01:54:53,098 --> 01:54:56,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1552
01:54:56,141 --> 01:54:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it for Twitter topics tonight.

1553
01:54:57,482 --> 01:55:00,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to talk to us throughout the week.

1554
01:55:00,546 --> 01:55:01,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to some other news.

1555
01:55:01,387 --> 01:55:01,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1556
01:55:02,127 --> 01:55:10,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamasutra ran kind of an editorial about the whole PlayStation debacle, I guess, right now.

1557
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:22,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they were saying the PlayStation brand faces an uncertain future, and they're worried that Sony's kind of, as we kind of put it before, not handling the situation correctly.

1558
01:55:22,488 --> 01:55:24,950
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, here's a little test for you.

1559
01:55:25,271 --> 01:55:30,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of the following statements are you most likely to agree with in one year's term?

1560
01:55:31,096 --> 01:55:33,260
[SPEAKER_03]: A. Sony handled the situation amazingly.

1561
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:36,184
[SPEAKER_03]: They held up their hands and took an appropriate share of the blame.

1562
01:55:36,464 --> 01:55:45,698
[SPEAKER_03]: They outlined a clear plan of action to remedy the situation and made sure that all stakeholders were recompensed beyond reasonable expectations.

1563
01:55:46,358 --> 01:55:52,661
[SPEAKER_03]: and they showed their human side and came out of this as a stronger company.

1564
01:55:52,982 --> 01:55:55,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Or B, it just kind of went away, didn't it?

1565
01:55:55,763 --> 01:56:06,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony entirely laid the blame on hackers, launched a lot of legal flack, refused to take any responsibility, offered minimum clarity and token recompense.

1566
01:56:06,989 --> 01:56:08,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one cares anymore.

1567
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:11,651
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they've encrypted my personal data now.

1568
01:56:12,372 --> 01:56:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, most people probably agree with B.

1569
01:56:15,033 --> 01:56:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And even like, you know, they're saying like, you know, their response has been pretty pitiful.

1570
01:56:19,995 --> 01:56:25,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the best they did was send out an email and posted a post on their blog.

1571
01:56:25,158 --> 01:56:33,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you even read it, they said, we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this outage has caused.

1572
01:56:34,402 --> 01:56:37,003
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying this outage is like inclement water.

1573
01:56:37,183 --> 01:56:39,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also said, we made a mistake here.

1574
01:56:39,843 --> 01:56:40,704
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked a fight.

1575
01:56:40,824 --> 01:56:41,644
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't win.

1576
01:56:41,844 --> 01:56:44,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, they're saying they should have said, we made a mistake here.

1577
01:56:44,404 --> 01:56:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked a fight.

1578
01:56:44,885 --> 01:56:45,425
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't win.

1579
01:56:45,805 --> 01:56:50,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with attack, highly likely, we neglected the protector stuff.

1580
01:56:52,086 --> 01:56:55,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what they're saying is they could handle this, you know,

1581
01:56:56,545 --> 01:57:03,110
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way that could kind of get people to trust them again, you know, just kind of showing their human side.

1582
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:11,036
[SPEAKER_03]: But without it, you know, and kind of like what we were going back to before with, you know, talking about Jack in the Box and, you know, that stuff they mentioned.

1583
01:57:11,417 --> 01:57:21,805
[SPEAKER_03]: JetBlue, for example, had, you know, kind of a debacle and they ended up coming out of a better company because they spent time, effort to, you know,

1584
01:57:23,931 --> 01:57:29,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Improved their customer service and in turn they became a strong company.

1585
01:57:29,134 --> 01:57:31,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Domino's Pizza, Toyota.

1586
01:57:31,816 --> 01:57:36,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some of the brands that were kind of hard by a situation like this.

1587
01:57:36,699 --> 01:57:44,925
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they kind of turned it around with their dedication to kind of changing their ways.

1588
01:57:45,385 --> 01:57:48,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony so far have said, here's some DLC.

1589
01:57:48,387 --> 01:57:49,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we're going to...

1590
01:57:50,548 --> 01:57:52,629
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on Protector Data now.

1591
01:57:53,449 --> 01:57:54,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're kind of right.

1592
01:57:54,549 --> 01:57:54,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1593
01:57:56,550 --> 01:58:03,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the PlayStation brand, as far as trusting them with my information, maybe that's harmed a bit.

1594
01:58:03,832 --> 01:58:09,934
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of stretching the PlayStation brand a little thin, if you ask me.

1595
01:58:09,954 --> 01:58:12,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with tablet devices and stuff now.

1596
01:58:12,835 --> 01:58:17,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it plays PlayStation 1 games, I don't really know if you should call it a PlayStation device.

1597
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:30,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you know, I hate to kind of beat a dead horse, because we were talking about this in Part A anyway, and it's kind of like, I really think Sony can recover from this, despite what all the rampant, angry gamer chat on the internet would make you think.

1598
01:58:31,124 --> 01:58:36,546
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's like Microsoft recovered from the Red Ring of Death thing, and let's be real, that was a pretty serious thing that happened.

1599
01:58:37,147 --> 01:58:40,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Nintendo recovered from, well, the Virtual Boy.

1600
01:58:41,132 --> 01:58:46,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, companies can recover, and they will, but they have to do the right thing.

1601
01:58:46,295 --> 01:58:46,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1602
01:58:47,396 --> 01:58:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Being hard-headed is not the right thing.

1603
01:58:48,977 --> 01:58:56,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, Microsoft, I think they never really came up... Obviously, they didn't come up front and say how many of their systems were affected by the Red Ring problem.

1604
01:58:57,762 --> 01:58:58,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a hint.

1605
01:58:58,482 --> 01:59:00,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all of them at launch.

1606
01:59:00,483 --> 01:59:01,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one.

1607
01:59:02,044 --> 01:59:04,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one will die eventually.

1608
01:59:05,046 --> 01:59:05,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this.

1609
01:59:05,967 --> 01:59:06,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It will happen.

1610
01:59:07,628 --> 01:59:08,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one.

1611
01:59:08,828 --> 01:59:09,469
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be lucky.

1612
01:59:09,709 --> 01:59:09,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I would...

1613
01:59:12,265 --> 01:59:12,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1614
01:59:12,765 --> 01:59:17,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be very impressed to see a system that actually... One of their launch systems that's still working today.

1615
01:59:18,247 --> 01:59:19,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's being regularly played.

1616
01:59:19,747 --> 01:59:22,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee that there's less than 1%.

1617
01:59:23,128 --> 01:59:24,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, let's be honest.

1618
01:59:24,348 --> 01:59:27,729
[SPEAKER_03]: They've fixed it after multiple iterations and tweaks and stuff like that.

1619
01:59:27,849 --> 01:59:29,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Now their system is stable.

1620
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not dying.

1621
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:35,551
[SPEAKER_03]: They improved their warranties and stuff.

1622
01:59:35,851 --> 01:59:36,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years and stuff.

1623
01:59:36,771 --> 01:59:38,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And they covered replacements for a lot of it.

1624
01:59:38,672 --> 01:59:38,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1625
01:59:39,292 --> 01:59:42,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sucked having to replace the system a bunch of times.

1626
01:59:42,254 --> 01:59:43,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Apple and the iPhone 4.

1627
01:59:43,695 --> 01:59:45,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another big one, too, with the antenna gate.

1628
01:59:45,637 --> 01:59:46,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

1629
01:59:46,297 --> 01:59:46,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1630
01:59:46,678 --> 01:59:47,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've recovered fine.

1631
01:59:48,059 --> 01:59:49,760
[SPEAKER_04]: iPads 2s are selling like crazy.

1632
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:53,223
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all about how you handle it.

1633
01:59:55,171 --> 02:00:00,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, I'm sorry, not everyone reads the PlayStation blog, okay?

1634
02:00:00,775 --> 02:00:16,526
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking at your average mom and pop users, say they have, you know, signed up on the PlayStation Network and they buy stuff through there, they're not reading the internet blogs, you know, and stuff, and yeah, okay, they get an email, but let's just say, for example, that, you know, they used an email with that service that,

1635
02:00:17,227 --> 02:00:18,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they don't use that quite regularly.

1636
02:00:19,049 --> 02:00:32,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would have absolutely no idea this is going on until they hear from a media outlet saying, Oh yeah, Sony's just been hacked and all these people's credit card information has been leaked out.

1637
02:00:33,585 --> 02:00:35,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that's not good.

1638
02:00:35,867 --> 02:00:38,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you need to be telling your customers up front.

1639
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:42,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least, you know, being a little bit more clear about it.

1640
02:00:42,391 --> 02:00:43,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Put out a statement or something.

1641
02:00:43,912 --> 02:00:50,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they did the press conference thing, but I'm sorry, though.

1642
02:00:50,417 --> 02:00:51,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just pointing blame.

1643
02:00:52,398 --> 02:00:53,939
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

1644
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting.

1645
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:57,682
[SPEAKER_03]: E3, I'm sure they're going to mention something.

1646
02:00:58,082 --> 02:01:00,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, it's still going to be fresh in everybody's mind.

1647
02:01:02,836 --> 02:01:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, obviously it's not just Sony with news in the world right now.

1648
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox, they had a pretty big thing come out this week.

1649
02:01:09,062 --> 02:01:11,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Hulu Plus actually just came out to the system.

1650
02:01:11,704 --> 02:01:15,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released on April 29th, and yeah, it was kind of fast.

1651
02:01:15,948 --> 02:01:19,271
[SPEAKER_04]: The news came out during the week, and then suddenly, whew, bam, there's Hulu Plus.

1652
02:01:19,712 --> 02:01:24,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there is actually this whole sponsorship going on, and I apologize.

1653
02:01:24,156 --> 02:01:26,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot the company that was sponsoring it, but it doesn't matter.

1654
02:01:26,838 --> 02:01:27,519
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not paying us.

1655
02:01:27,899 --> 02:01:56,736
[SPEAKER_04]: so some company is actually sponsoring a two week preview of Hulu Plus right now and then I guess you can also get another one if you actually sign up through Hulu's website and you get a two week trial there as well so if you want to try out Hulu Plus for like a month you can do so I have not signed up for it and probably I'm not going to I think Hulu Plus is kind of a shitty idea because I'm not a fan of the fact that there's still commercials and you're paying for it like honestly I've got Netflix it's got the shows I want to see otherwise if they don't have it I'll just torn it

1656
02:01:57,396 --> 02:02:06,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not to come out and admit that I'm a bloody thief or whatever, but I'd use Hulu if it was money or commercials, but not both.

1657
02:02:06,932 --> 02:02:08,134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just ridiculous to me.

1658
02:02:09,901 --> 02:02:10,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1659
02:02:31,596 --> 02:02:32,377
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

1660
02:02:32,437 --> 02:02:33,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Diversity.

1661
02:02:33,357 --> 02:02:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to... Oh, right.

1662
02:02:35,159 --> 02:02:36,060
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do diversity.

1663
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:40,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch your cues through pretty much any device that will do streaming.

1664
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I use my PlayStation 3 for that.

1665
02:02:43,826 --> 02:02:45,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually works pretty well for that.

1666
02:02:45,727 --> 02:02:49,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulu doesn't look that great, though, because it's kind of low resolution.

1667
02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:54,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've watched a few episodes of The Office that we were missing when we were catching up all the seasons and stuff.

1668
02:02:55,054 --> 02:02:55,195
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1669
02:02:57,614 --> 02:02:58,014
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1670
02:03:19,451 --> 02:03:22,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, we do have something for the 3DS.

1671
02:03:23,134 --> 02:03:29,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Excitebike 3D Classic is going to be offered on the 3DS for free.

1672
02:03:29,578 --> 02:03:33,941
[SPEAKER_06]: When the 3DS eShop goes live, this is going to be a part of it.

1673
02:03:34,962 --> 02:03:42,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, it's 3D Excitebike, so you get it in full lenticular motion.

1674
02:03:42,067 --> 02:03:47,871
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't say where it was going to be for, but it could possibly just be Japan.

1675
02:03:48,462 --> 02:03:50,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what's kind of retarded.

1676
02:03:50,863 --> 02:03:53,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone's actually seen a Japanese 3DS.

1677
02:03:54,185 --> 02:03:59,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have, but in the beginning of their... You know how we got this OK Go video?

1678
02:03:59,688 --> 02:04:06,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they got this Mario live music performance thing over there as the free 3D video.

1679
02:04:06,552 --> 02:04:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And before that actually starts, they have a 3D picture of Super Mario Bros.

1680
02:04:11,235 --> 02:04:10,954
1.

1681
02:04:12,175 --> 02:04:13,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way...

1682
02:04:14,236 --> 02:04:15,137
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1683
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a neat effect to see.

1684
02:04:38,041 --> 02:04:41,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's cool, but I would not spend very much money.

1685
02:04:41,983 --> 02:04:49,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the game is going to have to be a true NES classic that I need to have on my DS.

1686
02:04:49,526 --> 02:04:50,886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way I'm going to buy it again.

1687
02:04:50,906 --> 02:04:51,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, that's what they're doing.

1688
02:04:51,687 --> 02:04:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I got burned on the way.

1689
02:04:53,348 --> 02:04:54,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an emulator now.

1690
02:04:54,588 --> 02:04:59,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously that works with, you know, these, I mean, come on, anything can run an NES emulator nowadays.

1691
02:05:01,190 --> 02:05:06,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have an NES emulator that just spreads out the, you know, sprite layers.

1692
02:05:06,811 --> 02:05:11,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, shit, when Homebrew comes out, I'm sure someone will come up with that.

1693
02:05:11,812 --> 02:05:13,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that complicated.

1694
02:05:13,833 --> 02:05:14,613
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what they're going to do?

1695
02:05:14,633 --> 02:05:23,435
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to charge you like four bucks for each one of those games because people will buy them even though it's really not worth the effort that they put in to develop this emulator.

1696
02:05:24,895 --> 02:05:31,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really nice if they would just give us a kickback because we bought it on Wii Virtual Console.

1697
02:05:31,319 --> 02:05:33,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know that's not going to happen.

1698
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:34,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice?

1699
02:05:34,381 --> 02:05:41,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice, but they don't really... I mean, they have accounts that are tied to the Wii, but it's not an account that you can take everywhere.

1700
02:05:41,225 --> 02:05:43,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically just an account that's tied to that console.

1701
02:05:44,307 --> 02:05:47,128
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they had an actual centralized online...

1702
02:05:48,089 --> 02:05:48,589
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1703
02:06:13,369 --> 02:06:18,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all you'd have to do is just tweak the display so that each sprite layer is a different layer of 3D.

1704
02:06:18,453 --> 02:06:20,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not hard.

1705
02:06:21,516 --> 02:06:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not difficult, and it's very minimal.

1706
02:06:24,278 --> 02:06:26,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that should be free.

1707
02:06:28,662 --> 02:06:29,182
[SPEAKER_04]: But it won't be.

1708
02:06:29,622 --> 02:06:31,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after all, how else are these things going to print money?

1709
02:06:32,102 --> 02:06:32,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Even just a discount.

1710
02:06:33,063 --> 02:06:34,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Even just like a little discount.

1711
02:06:35,364 --> 02:06:38,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe like if I get enough Nintendo achievements.

1712
02:06:38,746 --> 02:06:39,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1713
02:06:39,947 --> 02:06:43,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I could like get one for free.

1714
02:06:43,869 --> 02:06:45,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge them 99 cents.

1715
02:06:45,491 --> 02:06:46,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they really should be charging.

1716
02:06:46,671 --> 02:06:47,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, charge me 99 cents.

1717
02:06:49,433 --> 02:06:49,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

1718
02:06:49,913 --> 02:06:51,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I don't own the game at all, then fine.

1719
02:06:51,855 --> 02:06:52,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Charge me $5.99.

1720
02:06:53,516 --> 02:06:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Five what the game would have cost and the extra 99 cents for the 3D.

1721
02:06:56,437 --> 02:06:57,278
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it should not even be.

1722
02:06:57,838 --> 02:06:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: $6 for an old NES game.

1723
02:06:59,139 --> 02:06:59,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1724
02:06:59,599 --> 02:06:59,760
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1725
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1726
02:07:02,021 --> 02:07:03,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are worth it, but very few.

1727
02:07:04,341 --> 02:07:05,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are worth it.

1728
02:07:08,162 --> 02:07:13,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I mean, I can go buy the original on cartridge, but sometimes the original cartridges will cost you more than five bucks.

1729
02:07:13,923 --> 02:07:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Just depends on what game you're talking about.

1730
02:07:15,563 --> 02:07:16,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1731
02:07:16,444 --> 02:07:18,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if you're trying to fill up your Tengen collection.

1732
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:19,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1733
02:07:19,284 --> 02:07:20,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, Afterburner is mentioned.

1734
02:07:21,484 --> 02:07:24,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have your Fantasy Zone.

1735
02:07:25,025 --> 02:07:25,745
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't know that.

1736
02:07:26,045 --> 02:07:26,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1737
02:07:27,065 --> 02:07:27,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1738
02:07:27,585 --> 02:07:28,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, didn't I lend it to you?

1739
02:07:28,666 --> 02:07:29,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

1740
02:07:29,566 --> 02:07:30,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just so you know.

1741
02:07:30,982 --> 02:07:39,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I was mentioning Afterburner, they did a Tengen one for Ness.

1742
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:40,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thought I'd mention that.

1743
02:07:41,116 --> 02:07:42,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Comment in our chatroom from Toagak.

1744
02:07:43,017 --> 02:07:45,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo ripped off a homebrew emulator.

1745
02:07:46,778 --> 02:07:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1746
02:07:49,638 --> 02:07:52,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they need to because they've got an emulator for the Wii.

1747
02:07:53,019 --> 02:07:54,320
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got all the tech docs they need.

1748
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,620
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got an emulator for a Wii.

1749
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:58,801
[SPEAKER_03]: They had cartridges on the Game Boy Advance.

1750
02:07:59,221 --> 02:08:00,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even, I think, the Game Boy Color.

1751
02:08:01,022 --> 02:08:03,462
[SPEAKER_03]: They had NES cartridges.

1752
02:08:05,943 --> 02:08:09,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've gotten... I mean, hell, they have an emulator that runs on the Game Boy.

1753
02:08:09,325 --> 02:08:11,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously going to run on the 3DS.

1754
02:08:12,007 --> 02:08:13,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have that kind of data there.

1755
02:08:14,088 --> 02:08:16,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just minimal tweaking to get it to be in 3D.

1756
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:21,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's not any special effects that they're adding or anything.

1757
02:08:21,993 --> 02:08:29,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it was like some Mode 7 games or something like that, that might be a little bit cooler if those were in 3D because they had a lot of scaling there, but...

1758
02:08:29,937 --> 02:08:37,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, just, just doing like, you know, separating the sprite layers is, I'm sorry, it's like child's play stuff.

1759
02:08:38,242 --> 02:08:43,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, I mean, people are gonna find it neat, but once again, they're selling you on the gimmick.

1760
02:08:43,905 --> 02:08:49,428
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling you on your memories of these retro games because they're like, oh my god, Nintendo gets, oh, it's in 3D now!

1761
02:08:51,789 --> 02:08:59,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you're going to buy into that and you're just only encouraging them to spend what little effort they will on this stuff.

1762
02:09:00,655 --> 02:09:01,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, you know what?

1763
02:09:01,415 --> 02:09:02,776
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's what you want, then fine.

1764
02:09:03,497 --> 02:09:05,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're not going to change their ways anytime soon.

1765
02:09:06,819 --> 02:09:07,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

1766
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:08,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy what you want.

1767
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my money.

1768
02:09:11,242 --> 02:09:12,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll spend it how I want.

1769
02:09:12,502 --> 02:09:13,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

1770
02:09:14,984 --> 02:09:17,405
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did you pay to import the Japanese 3DS again?

1771
02:09:17,966 --> 02:09:18,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

1772
02:09:18,986 --> 02:09:19,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you remind me?

1773
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:25,285
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's role is to be the girl, your role is to be the tech master, and mine is to give the both of you shit.

1774
02:09:25,546 --> 02:09:25,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not just a girl.

1775
02:09:38,953 --> 02:09:42,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to say a bitch, but I thought that would be me.

1776
02:09:42,896 --> 02:09:52,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I would almost consider selling that 3DS again just to get rid of it because I'm not playing anything on it really right now and I have a feeling it's just going to be collecting dust like my DS is.

1777
02:09:55,336 --> 02:09:56,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1778
02:10:13,419 --> 02:10:15,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I will seriously think about it.

1779
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't have some really awesome games at launch, then count me out.

1780
02:10:22,202 --> 02:10:27,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait until some future versions come out.

1781
02:10:28,044 --> 02:10:32,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be so impulse crazy nowadays because it really doesn't get me anything.

1782
02:10:32,546 --> 02:10:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play Ridge Racer in 3D for a little bit.

1783
02:10:36,047 --> 02:10:39,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool, but I don't know.

1784
02:10:39,448 --> 02:10:41,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that big of a deal.

1785
02:10:42,734 --> 02:10:48,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And it all really matters about the cost of that console, because, man, that thing's like $300 plus $100 for the controller.

1786
02:10:49,837 --> 02:10:50,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1787
02:10:52,538 --> 02:10:52,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe.

1788
02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:57,741
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on with some, what, hacking news, right?

1789
02:10:57,981 --> 02:11:01,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the PlayStation Network's not the only thing that's being hacked.

1790
02:11:01,862 --> 02:11:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, there's kind of been a struggle between, you know, hackers creating custom firmwares for the drives of...

1791
02:11:10,406 --> 02:11:38,602
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course Microsoft in updating those they have the new firmware that's going to be coming out or the new dashboard update that's going to tweak the disks as well as enabling what they call AP 2.5 on all the games it's basically a new copy protection that they have right now on a couple of the Call of Duty games and on Assassin's Creed and actually some of the newer games of course all that stuff can be patched

1792
02:11:39,903 --> 02:11:41,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some interesting things coming out.

1793
02:11:42,226 --> 02:11:45,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this is almost similar to the PlayStation 3.

1794
02:11:46,331 --> 02:11:52,259
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there is a device coming out called the X360 Key.

1795
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:56,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow you to play any game from a USB drive.

1796
02:11:57,646 --> 02:12:07,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it's basically going to be, it's going to be a device that connects in between your Xbox 360, the SATA connection that's on there, and the DVD drive.

1797
02:12:08,257 --> 02:12:12,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will allow it to emulate the actual DVD drive itself.

1798
02:12:13,042 --> 02:12:18,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll make it think that it's playing discs off the drive when it's actually playing ISOs off a USB drive.

1799
02:12:19,549 --> 02:12:20,450
[SPEAKER_03]: or a hard drive.

1800
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:22,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually the system has Linux running on it.

1801
02:12:22,913 --> 02:12:24,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fully upgradable.

1802
02:12:25,976 --> 02:12:34,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it's going to have protection against whatever the E25 protection emulation as well built in there.

1803
02:12:35,045 --> 02:12:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Outro Outro

1804
02:12:52,777 --> 02:13:04,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, if that's not your way to go, the Commodore Forever, they announced that they're going to have a new iXtreme LT firmware for all drives, including...

1805
02:13:08,394 --> 02:13:08,975
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not.

1806
02:13:09,475 --> 02:13:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the hacking group, Commodore Forever.

1807
02:13:11,277 --> 02:13:11,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Last Ninja?

1808
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:15,521
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been working on firmwares for the drives for a long time.

1809
02:13:16,022 --> 02:13:23,650
[SPEAKER_03]: They say their LT 2.0 supports the XG D3, which is the new disk format that Microsoft's putting out to gain that extra one gig.

1810
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:30,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the slim, light-on 0.225 drive, which was unhackable as of right now.

1811
02:13:32,258 --> 02:13:41,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently that will allow you to bypass all this different protection and allow you to flash your drives and it's supposed to be untraceable as of right now.

1812
02:13:41,303 --> 02:13:48,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the light touch stuff has been pretty stealthy as far as live goes so that's kind of interesting.

1813
02:13:49,148 --> 02:14:12,829
[SPEAKER_03]: and the last thing was another device called Xbox 360 Optical Drive Emulation and it's an emulator that will be a little bit similar to the X360 key whereas the device set will make it look like it's running actual disks when it's running stuff off of a hard drive.

1814
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:16,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.

1815
02:14:16,072 --> 02:14:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this stuff can be patched out with one firmware update, but some of this, especially with the custom firmwares for the disk drives, it's back and forth with them.

1816
02:14:29,583 --> 02:14:42,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the new firmware that's coming out, if you do have a flash device right now, what it's going to do is it's going to flash it back to stock, and then it's going to copy protect it, I guess, so that you can't adjust the firmware that's on your drive.

1817
02:14:42,113 --> 02:14:43,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's kind of interesting.

1818
02:14:46,991 --> 02:14:50,752
[SPEAKER_04]: How long before we're emulating the actual Xbox 360 on our PCs?

1819
02:14:51,273 --> 02:14:52,353
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time.

1820
02:14:53,073 --> 02:14:56,594
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking multi-core processors and emulating that stuff.

1821
02:14:57,415 --> 02:14:59,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a long time before we're able to do that.

1822
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:01,256
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years.

1823
02:15:04,044 --> 02:15:08,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1824
02:15:08,368 --> 02:15:10,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one has to do with the iPhone.

1825
02:15:11,110 --> 02:15:18,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, this is something I actually did a double take and I was like, what is this being posted in our show role thread for?

1826
02:15:18,997 --> 02:15:20,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't we reported on this before?

1827
02:15:21,399 --> 02:15:23,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have, but we haven't.

1828
02:15:23,421 --> 02:15:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean is, this is yet another game that has appeared on the iTunes App Store that was copied off of a Flash game.

1829
02:15:30,246 --> 02:15:56,725
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is called Achilles Defense It was available on the iTunes Store They're based in Hanoi, Vietnam PTT Solution It is a rip-off of Ironhide's Clash of the Olympians Ironhide Game Studio, excuse me, Clash of the Olympians The only difference is Ironhide's game has three characters PTT's app has one The music, the artwork, the gameplay It is all the same

1830
02:15:57,365 --> 02:15:58,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Clash of the Olympians

1831
02:16:14,302 --> 02:16:20,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Needless to say, it's there, it's been on the App Store How does Apple prevent this?

1832
02:16:20,805 --> 02:16:32,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because they don't really screen the content of games I don't know, like, obviously this news is very sad That development company who, you know, had the game out there for free Did you see the Mario ripoff on there too?

1833
02:16:32,231 --> 02:16:40,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, that was the other, I think, thing that had come out before There's Mario ripoff and there was that other game too that had come out So...

1834
02:16:41,676 --> 02:16:44,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blocks Cometh, and then there was also some bunny game.

1835
02:16:45,278 --> 02:16:46,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunny fighting game.

1836
02:16:46,178 --> 02:16:49,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was less of a rip-off and more of a rights issue.

1837
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:50,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Who owned the rights to it and stuff.

1838
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:52,741
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other one was a complete rip-off.

1839
02:16:53,325 --> 02:17:04,029
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, Ironhide is pissed and they wrote Apple to complain and they want gamers to help assist them by lodging their own complaints in the game's comment space.

1840
02:17:04,069 --> 02:17:06,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're encouraging people to downvote this thing.

1841
02:17:06,531 --> 02:17:12,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it is the weekend, so I don't know what's going to happen, but come Monday I'm sure it's going to get crazy.

1842
02:17:14,054 --> 02:17:15,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe Apple will pull it down, I don't know.

1843
02:17:19,825 --> 02:17:20,326
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1844
02:17:21,767 --> 02:17:24,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to the mailbag.

1845
02:17:24,929 --> 02:17:26,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and boy, we've got a fun one this week.

1846
02:17:27,471 --> 02:17:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Because DarkSakura got a taco before the show started.

1847
02:17:31,013 --> 02:17:33,295
[SPEAKER_04]: She was only getting that taco if we got 10 emails.

1848
02:17:33,495 --> 02:17:34,236
[SPEAKER_06]: We got more than that.

1849
02:17:34,276 --> 02:17:34,996
[SPEAKER_04]: We got more than that.

1850
02:17:35,056 --> 02:17:36,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know if she's reading every single one.

1851
02:17:37,638 --> 02:17:38,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doubting that, right?

1852
02:17:38,678 --> 02:17:39,098
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1853
02:17:39,138 --> 02:17:48,220
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, pretty much anything that's repeating the emails that Sony sent out for PSN and our rehashes of things we've already discussed, not reading them.

1854
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:50,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give you a super tip if you want to email the show.

1855
02:17:51,021 --> 02:17:53,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, the show is about where every gamer has a voice.

1856
02:17:53,821 --> 02:17:59,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes people want to email us to clue us into news and things that are going on, which is fine, especially because sometimes we miss those things.

1857
02:17:59,862 --> 02:18:02,143
[SPEAKER_04]: They fall off the radar, like the case of the Marvel Universe thing.

1858
02:18:02,904 --> 02:18:03,565
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier in the show.

1859
02:18:03,686 --> 02:18:05,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And TigerClaw brought that to our attention via Twitter.

1860
02:18:05,911 --> 02:18:08,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But if everybody's talking about it, like the PSN thing,

1861
02:18:09,229 --> 02:18:10,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably going to cover it in the show.

1862
02:18:11,531 --> 02:18:13,652
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to know your thoughts.

1863
02:18:14,113 --> 02:18:15,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just regurgitate the news.

1864
02:18:15,654 --> 02:18:17,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us what you think.

1865
02:18:17,395 --> 02:18:23,860
[SPEAKER_04]: A better email will tell us about what you plan to do because of the Sony hack, which I imagine we're going to get to in some of these emails.

1866
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:28,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them were that they were also repeat emailers I'm trying to give new people attention to.

1867
02:18:28,684 --> 02:18:29,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, absolutely.

1868
02:18:29,665 --> 02:18:30,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1869
02:18:30,205 --> 02:18:36,570
[SPEAKER_04]: As it is, I'm being... If you've had a lot of emails, if your voice has been heard a lot, don't be butthurt that we do some other people tonight.

1870
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:36,570
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

1871
02:18:39,252 --> 02:18:40,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading 11 of them.

1872
02:18:40,474 --> 02:18:40,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1873
02:18:40,934 --> 02:18:41,194
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1874
02:18:41,234 --> 02:18:41,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here we go, then.

1875
02:18:42,196 --> 02:18:42,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1876
02:18:43,797 --> 02:18:45,579
[SPEAKER_06]: This one, it's taco time.

1877
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:50,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Join our valiant chef, DarkSakura, on her quest to defeat the evil Montezuma and his army of veggies.

1878
02:18:51,326 --> 02:18:54,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Will our hero be able to stop a digestive disaster and create the perfect taco?

1879
02:18:55,171 --> 02:18:56,152
[SPEAKER_06]: With your help, she can.

1880
02:18:56,292 --> 02:18:57,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Only for Xbox 360.

1881
02:18:57,493 --> 02:19:00,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-order today and receive an official taco time salsa spoon.

1882
02:19:00,877 --> 02:19:02,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I know this has been terribly lame, but I couldn't resist.

1883
02:19:03,059 --> 02:19:05,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you at least get a chuckle out of this.

1884
02:19:06,021 --> 02:19:08,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a long-time listener, but this isn't my first time writing in.

1885
02:19:08,702 --> 02:19:12,605
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys help me survive my boring job, so keep up the gaming news and crazy tangents.

1886
02:19:12,985 --> 02:19:14,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Feed Jamie tacos now!

1887
02:19:14,406 --> 02:19:15,487
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from Panaxium.

1888
02:19:15,627 --> 02:19:16,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, we fed her.

1889
02:19:16,808 --> 02:19:17,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And he sent me a picture.

1890
02:19:17,948 --> 02:19:18,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet.

1891
02:19:19,602 --> 02:19:20,263
[SPEAKER_04]: TacoTime.

1892
02:19:20,683 --> 02:19:21,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is great.

1893
02:19:21,384 --> 02:19:22,164
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1894
02:19:23,045 --> 02:19:27,069
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually put your picture in the little chef's hat on TacoTime.

1895
02:19:27,609 --> 02:19:29,671
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually pretty decent Photoshopping.

1896
02:19:29,691 --> 02:19:30,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saving it.

1897
02:19:30,152 --> 02:19:32,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Upload that to the Orange Lawns Radio website thingy.

1898
02:19:33,174 --> 02:19:36,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the super secret email now, so we stopped getting the Godse pictures.

1899
02:19:36,477 --> 02:19:38,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you do that, Rob.

1900
02:19:38,359 --> 02:19:38,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine.

1901
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:39,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look it up.

1902
02:19:40,934 --> 02:19:41,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take care of it.

1903
02:19:41,575 --> 02:19:43,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Forward it to me so I do it.

1904
02:19:45,338 --> 02:19:45,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1905
02:19:46,118 --> 02:19:46,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take care of it later.

1906
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

1907
02:19:47,239 --> 02:19:47,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded it.

1908
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1909
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:49,221
[SPEAKER_06]: This one.

1910
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:51,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR, it's been a while since I last emailed you guys.

1911
02:19:52,023 --> 02:19:53,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I also miss listening live.

1912
02:19:53,144 --> 02:19:54,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I really need to get back into the habit of doing that.

1913
02:19:55,045 --> 02:19:55,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you do.

1914
02:19:57,583 --> 02:20:06,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I just got through with changing pretty much all of my passwords on multiple sites, as well as notifying my bank of the PSN intrusion, compromising my account.

1915
02:20:06,787 --> 02:20:08,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, this has been a huge wake-up call for me.

1916
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:12,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Never before have I been this concerned about my personal information on the internet.

1917
02:20:13,330 --> 02:20:20,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's failure to protect my privacy and resolve this issue as quickly as possible really has me thinking twice about my future purchases on the PSN.

1918
02:20:21,673 --> 02:20:26,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard of PSN cards like you buy in the stores, sort of like the Xbox Live or iTunes cards.

1919
02:20:26,577 --> 02:20:28,038
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a safer route to go.

1920
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:33,243
[SPEAKER_06]: On a lighter note, have any of you checked out Sonic Colors for the Wii?

1921
02:20:33,643 --> 02:20:37,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Before Sonic Generations comes out, I highly recommend that you don't miss out on this game.

1922
02:20:37,946 --> 02:20:40,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's the one I was wanting to get, but we loaned out our Wii.

1923
02:20:41,549 --> 02:20:42,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a lot of fun.

1924
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:43,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Great soundtrack as well.

1925
02:20:43,491 --> 02:20:47,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega focused a lot more on the game design and gameplay rather than story this time around.

1926
02:20:47,995 --> 02:20:48,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have no issue...

1927
02:20:49,776 --> 02:20:54,000
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other than rolling my eyes at some of the cheesy lines in the cutscenes.

1928
02:20:54,321 --> 02:20:55,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's all for now.

1929
02:20:55,121 --> 02:20:56,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for reading, Osfer.

1930
02:20:56,302 --> 02:20:56,723
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

1931
02:20:56,823 --> 02:21:00,046
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that Xbox 360 OLR autographed faceplate?

1932
02:21:00,106 --> 02:21:00,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck.

1933
02:21:00,947 --> 02:21:04,130
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just actually found a bunch of faceplates.

1934
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:05,852
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay.

1935
02:21:06,673 --> 02:21:12,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to email you back with my real email so that you can email me and we'll work on it, okay?

1936
02:21:14,599 --> 02:21:15,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello there, Orange Lens Radio.

1937
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:24,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel compelled to take the time out of my busy night to write you this email as the three of you on occasion entertain the masses.

1938
02:21:25,023 --> 02:21:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I found your show while being very bored at work on Stitcher today because at 1330 hours I was actually going through the mini podcast and I found yours to be the most enjoyable.

1939
02:21:35,466 --> 02:21:37,987
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I never really listened to any type of podcast.

1940
02:21:38,627 --> 02:21:43,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I was bored of my music mixes on my Blackberry and wanted to hear people talk about topics I enjoy.

1941
02:21:44,051 --> 02:21:50,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, after listening I was heavily informed about what's what in gaming and not to mention walked away with a craving of tacos.

1942
02:21:51,036 --> 02:22:02,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be subscribing via iTunes but sadly not too many of my friends are gamers so I don't really have anyone to tell as I work executive protection and the three friends I would rather talk about weapon calibers.

1943
02:22:03,405 --> 02:22:03,565
Okay.

1944
02:22:04,065 --> 02:22:07,748
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will be trying to tune in while you are live on Sundays from now on.

1945
02:22:08,148 --> 02:22:09,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks for the great podcast.

1946
02:22:09,569 --> 02:22:12,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it and I found something new to look forward to at the end of the week.

1947
02:22:12,472 --> 02:22:13,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

1948
02:22:13,112 --> 02:22:13,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Shattered Hawk.

1949
02:22:13,813 --> 02:22:14,113
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

1950
02:22:14,453 --> 02:22:16,735
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, if you like tacos, you should try Navajo Tacos.

1951
02:22:16,755 --> 02:22:21,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Your head will explode from the pure deliciousness of this dish.

1952
02:22:22,059 --> 02:22:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I can find them.

1953
02:22:24,161 --> 02:22:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

1954
02:22:24,661 --> 02:22:25,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I love tacos.

1955
02:22:25,021 --> 02:22:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a chain or is that a type of taco?

1956
02:22:27,343 --> 02:22:27,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1957
02:22:29,105 --> 02:22:32,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We need either a recipe or we need a FedEx box to show up at the house.

1958
02:22:32,728 --> 02:22:33,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a 411.

1959
02:22:34,749 --> 02:22:36,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, you see what I did there?

1960
02:22:36,611 --> 02:22:37,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm clever.

1961
02:22:37,472 --> 02:22:37,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1962
02:22:38,613 --> 02:22:38,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1963
02:22:41,135 --> 02:22:45,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering regarding the PSN hack slash outage hack slash

1964
02:22:46,039 --> 02:22:53,528
[SPEAKER_06]: If the possible phishing email I wrote about at the end of May had anything relation to the intrusion.

1965
02:22:53,989 --> 02:23:02,339
[SPEAKER_06]: The email did seem, upon reflection, fairly legitimate with no questions or warnings that you had to click through the link which I left untouched to enter personal information.

1966
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:05,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the address it was sent from seemed suspect.

1967
02:23:05,723 --> 02:23:17,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, I noticed the latest issue of Games Magazine, July 2011, has a feature story on the selling of harmonics and the suspension of Guitar Hero, as well as the reviewers' take on the Dead Space 2 ad controversy.

1968
02:23:18,206 --> 02:23:23,387
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, of course, months-old news, but to be fair, Games is not intended as a video game news source.

1969
02:23:23,487 --> 02:23:34,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It is first and foremost a magazine of crossword and logic puzzles, with articles about board games, and within the last decade or so of video games as well, with issues likely being put together months before being published.

1970
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:37,591
[SPEAKER_06]: The July issue arriving in late April.

1971
02:23:38,092 --> 02:23:43,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy games for what it is, but wonder about your take on the ultra-casual gaming press.

1972
02:23:43,395 --> 02:23:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And this comes from Robert M. I don't really pay attention to it, so I don't know.

1973
02:23:51,299 --> 02:23:54,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally stopped getting a lot of those news release emails.

1974
02:23:55,001 --> 02:23:56,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Zynga farted.

1975
02:23:57,162 --> 02:23:57,943
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that type of thing.

1976
02:23:59,039 --> 02:23:59,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of don't care.

1977
02:24:00,601 --> 02:24:02,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if I want to play...

1978
02:24:22,022 --> 02:24:28,568
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a local channel here that reported on the whole PlayStation Network breach because it was the top story on the day that it happened.

1979
02:24:28,608 --> 02:24:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It let off the 11 o'clock news.

1980
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And they twisted it to turn into a parents need to be monitoring what their children do type of story.

1981
02:24:36,514 --> 02:24:39,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yes, I understand they should, but it seemed like...

1982
02:24:40,237 --> 02:24:40,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

1983
02:24:40,357 --> 02:24:40,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

1984
02:25:02,170 --> 02:25:05,998
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, completely random aside, but it totally ties into this email.

1985
02:25:06,579 --> 02:25:11,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get a last-minute story submission, and it has to do with speaking of...

1986
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:14,971
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1987
02:25:39,810 --> 02:25:43,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I guess they're going to merge and continue to publish worthless stories.

1988
02:25:45,782 --> 02:25:46,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1989
02:25:47,665 --> 02:25:49,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So, is it my turn?

1990
02:25:50,291 --> 02:25:50,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sorry.

1991
02:25:50,792 --> 02:25:50,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1992
02:25:51,857 --> 02:26:00,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello all, okay, I know this is probably your first email, first or second email, but I'm going to tell you, if you are going to pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

1993
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:03,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Apostrophes are for possessives, the end.

1994
02:26:03,621 --> 02:26:04,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I'll read it.

1995
02:26:05,302 --> 02:26:07,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello all, first of all, I have to say I'm loving the show.

1996
02:26:07,742 --> 02:26:12,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, I want to get Jamie her tacos, so I thought I should write to you guys.

1997
02:26:13,304 --> 02:26:14,665
[SPEAKER_06]: My taco was delicious, thank you.

1998
02:26:15,285 --> 02:26:16,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question.

1999
02:26:16,426 --> 02:26:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a hardcore MMO player.

2000
02:26:17,966 --> 02:26:24,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard has its firm grasp on my wallet for six years, and I recently dabbled a bit in playing Rift alongside WoW.

2001
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:28,932
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, I think Rift made me want to play WoW again, and I always wondered why that was.

2002
02:26:29,072 --> 02:26:29,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Any ideas?

2003
02:26:30,173 --> 02:26:32,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe because it made you really appreciate World of Warcraft?

2004
02:26:33,415 --> 02:26:33,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe?

2005
02:26:34,695 --> 02:26:37,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there are lots of new MMOs being released.

2006
02:26:37,057 --> 02:26:42,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Terra Online, which I like to call Chicks with Gigantic Boobs MMO, The Old Republic, and The Secret World.

2007
02:26:42,962 --> 02:26:43,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I want to play them?

2008
02:26:43,763 --> 02:26:47,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I actually want to play all of them, but I know most will probably disappoint me.

2009
02:26:48,047 --> 02:26:51,530
[SPEAKER_06]: In reality, I'll probably just stick with the two MMOs, but yes, here's my real question.

2010
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:54,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, do you think it's possible to juggle two MMOs at the same time?

2011
02:26:54,892 --> 02:26:58,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good show, and I hope that you get your tacos, Jamie.

2012
02:26:58,576 --> 02:26:59,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Love, Syl.

2013
02:26:59,797 --> 02:27:01,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it was our guest from Horde House this week.

2014
02:27:01,858 --> 02:27:02,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2015
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:04,019
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2016
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:06,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad now correcting.

2017
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:08,840
[SPEAKER_04]: You bitch.

2018
02:27:08,961 --> 02:27:09,581
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

2019
02:27:09,621 --> 02:27:10,941
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I said that was your role on the show.

2020
02:27:11,041 --> 02:27:13,182
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do that to everybody, so much love.

2021
02:27:13,442 --> 02:27:13,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2022
02:27:13,762 --> 02:27:21,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So, first of all, I actually want to go back and play Star Trek Online while I'm playing WoW, but I can't afford the two together right now.

2023
02:27:22,024 --> 02:27:28,465
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the hardest thing, is that, you know, trying to pay for two is usually the hardest thing to play to.

2024
02:27:29,105 --> 02:27:31,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of people juggle a freemium and a premium.

2025
02:27:32,186 --> 02:27:32,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2026
02:27:46,096 --> 02:27:49,360
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was on Star Trek Online, I played Ragnarok Online on a free server.

2027
02:27:50,222 --> 02:27:53,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was keeping up with two MMOs, no problem.

2028
02:27:54,147 --> 02:27:56,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the time it was just, which one are my friends hanging out on?

2029
02:27:56,330 --> 02:27:57,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll go play this one right now.

2030
02:27:57,311 --> 02:28:00,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, my guild's all asleep because I'm in America and they're not.

2031
02:28:01,277 --> 02:28:01,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

2032
02:28:02,378 --> 02:28:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

2033
02:28:31,332 --> 02:28:33,614
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2034
02:28:51,011 --> 02:28:51,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice email.

2035
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:10,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey y'all, I was listening to OLR about the PSN network going down and the guy who was writing in thought that Anonymous did it.

2036
02:29:10,644 --> 02:29:16,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally don't think it was them because they said they had realized it wouldn't hurt the people they were trying to stand up for, which is a point that I made.

2037
02:29:17,648 --> 02:29:24,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds to me like someone heard that Anonymous was doing this and decided to take advantage of having an obvious patsy and cover their own tracks.

2038
02:29:25,393 --> 02:29:30,536
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys seem to focus mainly on taking down websites and I've never heard of Anonymous actually stealing stuff.

2039
02:29:31,156 --> 02:29:34,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess it's possible, but it just doesn't sound right.

2040
02:29:35,159 --> 02:29:38,961
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the same people who defended that Casey Hines kid who was bullied.

2041
02:29:39,862 --> 02:29:43,465
[SPEAKER_06]: They sound like well-meaning folk, it just doesn't seem like them to me.

2042
02:29:43,625 --> 02:29:48,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Also about the hacking emails, I got one from Best Buy 2 saying that their email list had been stolen.

2043
02:29:48,588 --> 02:29:55,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems to be going around right now, and that's from Holly D. Wow, that's another Horde House listener I recognize.

2044
02:29:55,233 --> 02:29:55,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2045
02:29:57,111 --> 02:29:58,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

2046
02:29:58,992 --> 02:30:04,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting to see, especially with so many people involved, what the effect on the hackers could be.

2047
02:30:04,436 --> 02:30:08,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the end of the day, the hackers are the ones to blame, right?

2048
02:30:09,559 --> 02:30:13,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Although Sony should share their part in the accountability.

2049
02:30:14,202 --> 02:30:16,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2050
02:30:16,704 --> 02:30:23,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony needs to show what they're really doing to stop the hackers, other than, well, our system's hack-proof, inviting them in the front door.

2051
02:30:23,929 --> 02:30:24,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk out of your ass.

2052
02:30:25,630 --> 02:30:25,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2053
02:30:28,917 --> 02:30:30,783
[SPEAKER_06]: If any, please answer in comments or email.

2054
02:30:31,185 --> 02:30:32,509
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is this?

2055
02:30:34,694 --> 02:30:36,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, this is crap email.

2056
02:30:36,235 --> 02:30:36,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2057
02:30:36,495 --> 02:30:37,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it spam?

2058
02:30:37,216 --> 02:30:38,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2059
02:30:38,797 --> 02:30:43,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, we have one from Anime Jam Session Podcast Crew, which would be our buddy Ranma.

2060
02:30:43,900 --> 02:30:44,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Skip it.

2061
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:45,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

2062
02:30:45,621 --> 02:30:46,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

2063
02:30:47,022 --> 02:30:47,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Greetings, one and all.

2064
02:30:47,842 --> 02:30:49,803
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session here.

2065
02:30:50,084 --> 02:30:54,907
[SPEAKER_06]: In between downtime and edits for the site and podcasting and everything else, I have found time to send an email.

2066
02:30:55,447 --> 02:30:58,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have something to discuss, and I will get straight to the point.

2067
02:30:58,669 --> 02:31:03,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you squeed with delight over the revival of the Commodore 64, and Loki thought it was crazy.

2068
02:31:03,972 --> 02:31:04,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have your back on this.

2069
02:31:05,132 --> 02:31:12,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't grow up with a C64, but instead a Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 MC-10 and Color Computer 3 for me.

2070
02:31:12,654 --> 02:31:13,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I had one of those too.

2071
02:31:14,854 --> 02:31:18,455
[SPEAKER_06]: From reading the specs and design build of it, I can justify the cost, especially the Ultimate.

2072
02:31:19,035 --> 02:31:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you right now that the parts alone would run about $300 to $350 and probably another $200 for the case itself, since it's going to be made from the original materials, not the soft, cheap plastic crap, so Loki, stop hatin'.

2073
02:31:30,177 --> 02:31:30,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2074
02:31:30,637 --> 02:31:31,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for me to get back to work here.

2075
02:31:31,938 --> 02:31:34,159
[SPEAKER_06]: The monkeys are flinging their poo at me, duck.

2076
02:31:34,639 --> 02:31:35,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care and stay black.

2077
02:31:35,959 --> 02:31:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now the joke is officially dead.

2078
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:44,462
[SPEAKER_06]: This email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, a podcast dedicated to anime, cons, conventions, pop culture, and everything in between.

2079
02:31:44,502 --> 02:31:46,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Guaranteed podcast derailing or your money back.

2080
02:31:47,043 --> 02:31:50,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out at www.animejamsession.com Also on iTunes.

2081
02:31:51,045 --> 02:31:52,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.

2082
02:31:52,425 --> 02:31:55,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you read that part again that says to Loki, stop hating?

2083
02:31:55,667 --> 02:31:56,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop hatin'!

2084
02:31:57,647 --> 02:31:59,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why he's on the show is to hate.

2085
02:32:00,746 --> 02:32:01,828
[SPEAKER_04]: He's our resident hater.

2086
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:04,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's playing Portal right now.

2087
02:32:04,953 --> 02:32:06,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, Portal sucks.

2088
02:32:07,037 --> 02:32:07,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, no, it doesn't.

2089
02:32:07,939 --> 02:32:08,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nothing.

2090
02:32:09,761 --> 02:32:12,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR crew, long-time podcast listener, first-time writer.

2091
02:32:13,103 --> 02:32:17,827
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been many times that I have almost written in to comment on this, but never really felt compelled to until now.

2092
02:32:18,247 --> 02:32:19,628
[SPEAKER_06]: My reason for writing is twofold.

2093
02:32:20,088 --> 02:32:21,949
[SPEAKER_06]: One, most importantly, free tacos for DarkSakura.

2094
02:32:22,149 --> 02:32:22,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you.

2095
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:25,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this email will get to that magic number 10.

2096
02:32:26,072 --> 02:32:27,673
[SPEAKER_06]: You're up there on the list.

2097
02:32:28,234 --> 02:32:29,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, Rob, please say aloud the following.

2098
02:32:29,935 --> 02:32:30,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, ready?

2099
02:32:31,256 --> 02:32:32,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery.

2100
02:32:33,766 --> 02:32:36,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery and give half to Rob.

2101
02:32:37,249 --> 02:32:42,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm requesting this because obviously Rob is a prophet given his prediction of the PSN outage being a bigger deal than initially reported.

2102
02:32:43,815 --> 02:32:51,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I was listening to the podcast last week on the same day Sony said, Oh, and by the way, you know all that sensitive data we made you give us to play our games and use our services?

2103
02:32:52,242 --> 02:32:57,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we just put a Furby on guard to watch security and I guess the battery just ran out.

2104
02:32:58,127 --> 02:33:07,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally, if anything was up, that little sumbitch would start talking all kinds of crazy stuff like, Meeloo, wow!

2105
02:33:10,869 --> 02:33:12,050
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't worry, everyone.

2106
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:13,331
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put in a new battery.

2107
02:33:13,391 --> 02:33:18,534
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, just watch all your credit card info and change all your passwords.

2108
02:33:18,554 --> 02:33:19,154
[SPEAKER_06]: We cool, dog?

2109
02:33:19,174 --> 02:33:19,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we cool.

2110
02:33:21,335 --> 02:33:24,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure this topic has been beaten into the ground, so you can leave it at that.

2111
02:33:24,437 --> 02:33:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Beards of Whiskey and Rock and Roll, Beardy McWhiskey.

2112
02:33:27,639 --> 02:33:28,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Beardy McWhiskey.

2113
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:30,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he Canadian?

2114
02:33:30,721 --> 02:33:32,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but I want him to send me some whiskey.

2115
02:33:32,482 --> 02:33:33,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And send me the good stuff.

2116
02:33:34,603 --> 02:33:35,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And send me the beard.

2117
02:33:35,764 --> 02:33:36,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

2118
02:33:37,324 --> 02:33:39,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You would not be able to... Alan can rock the beard.

2119
02:33:40,208 --> 02:33:40,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan can't rock the beard.

2120
02:33:41,228 --> 02:33:42,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can rock the beard.

2121
02:33:42,189 --> 02:33:42,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't rock the beard.

2122
02:33:42,849 --> 02:33:43,729
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got that baby face.

2123
02:33:44,870 --> 02:33:45,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww.

2124
02:33:45,530 --> 02:33:45,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

2125
02:33:46,571 --> 02:33:49,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, I didn't think Dan could rock a beard, but now he's got the goatee of doom.

2126
02:33:49,212 --> 02:33:50,092
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

2127
02:33:50,672 --> 02:33:53,753
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days, I'm just going to shave my head, and then I'll have the beard, and we'll see what happens.

2128
02:33:53,773 --> 02:33:54,234
[SPEAKER_06]: He has too lumpy.

2129
02:33:54,834 --> 02:33:57,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I'm not going to have a choice soon enough.

2130
02:33:57,875 --> 02:34:00,676
[SPEAKER_06]: You could totally pull a Shatner and get the fake toupee.

2131
02:34:01,196 --> 02:34:01,776
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

2132
02:34:01,796 --> 02:34:02,657
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you a Tribble.

2133
02:34:03,777 --> 02:34:03,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Inhale.

2134
02:34:03,977 --> 02:34:08,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can pop you on the head and go, Rob Hart's.

2135
02:34:09,455 --> 02:34:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

2136
02:34:11,016 --> 02:34:12,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR, it's Spazinator again.

2137
02:34:12,458 --> 02:34:17,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Spazinator was one of the ones who sent me the big email from Sony, but this is the part that I'm going to read.

2138
02:34:18,522 --> 02:34:19,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR, it's Spazinator again.

2139
02:34:19,903 --> 02:34:23,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the second email, but I have a question for you regarding the PSN press release from 4.30.

2140
02:34:23,887 --> 02:34:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: The wording in one section has me a little confused.

2141
02:34:27,329 --> 02:34:28,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It states as follows.

2142
02:34:29,051 --> 02:34:36,497
[SPEAKER_06]: The company also expedited an already planned move of the system to a new data center in a different location that has been under construction and development for several months.

2143
02:34:36,877 --> 02:34:37,778
[SPEAKER_06]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8, PS9, PS10

2144
02:34:58,954 --> 02:35:11,903
[SPEAKER_06]: When they say that the password can only be changed on the same PS3 in which the account was activated, do they mean the PS3 in which you initially created the account, or if you, for the sake of this email, were on your fourth PS3 and had previously successfully activated your account for the current PS3?

2145
02:35:12,264 --> 02:35:14,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, the original one, but you'll be able to do it through email as well.

2146
02:35:15,466 --> 02:35:23,992
[SPEAKER_04]: If your original one died or whatever, you replaced it with a slim, whatever you did, you're not screwed, as long as you can still log into the email account that you use for PlayStation Network.

2147
02:35:24,528 --> 02:35:34,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask this because I have two PSN accounts, Spazinator and Movie underscore profile, and neither account were initially created on my current PS3, although I've had these profiles on my PS3 since Sony sent it to me.

2148
02:35:35,555 --> 02:35:47,302
[SPEAKER_06]: With one profile, the email address is current, up-to-date, and easily accessible, but for the other, I still have the old Final Fantasy XI slash POL, I guess that's Play Online, email address associated with it.

2149
02:35:47,802 --> 02:35:50,504
[SPEAKER_06]: and I haven't used that in a couple of years.

2150
02:35:50,744 --> 02:35:52,124
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I'm both confused and concerned.

2151
02:35:52,605 --> 02:35:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you please enlighten me on this issue?

2152
02:35:54,065 --> 02:35:54,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you in advance.

2153
02:35:54,706 --> 02:35:56,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can actually still get into your PlayOnline email.

2154
02:35:57,607 --> 02:35:58,288
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to.

2155
02:36:00,729 --> 02:36:02,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony SOE was not affected.

2156
02:36:03,270 --> 02:36:06,772
[SPEAKER_04]: They went down for a little bit but their information was fine and that would include PlayOnline.

2157
02:36:08,624 --> 02:36:10,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, we're almost done.

2158
02:36:10,605 --> 02:36:18,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one from Robert M. From what footage I've seen of Portal 2, how would you say it's fair to compare the ambience to that of Bioshock?

2159
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:20,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't played either yet, but hope to soon.

2160
02:36:20,911 --> 02:36:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Bioshock is a little bit more doom and gloom ominous.

2161
02:36:25,454 --> 02:36:32,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock strikes me as a little more steampunk, whereas Portal's just a little more... And it's a little bit more on the psychological horror.

2162
02:36:33,479 --> 02:36:34,760
[SPEAKER_06]: But Portal is the...

2163
02:36:35,245 --> 02:36:37,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely like Science Lab from old to new.

2164
02:36:37,948 --> 02:36:39,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how else to describe it.

2165
02:36:39,349 --> 02:36:41,651
[SPEAKER_06]: With that quirky humor.

2166
02:36:41,791 --> 02:36:44,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock, you know, keep in mind there's blood in Bioshock.

2167
02:36:44,894 --> 02:36:46,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not in Portal.

2168
02:36:46,256 --> 02:36:47,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal is really more of a puzzle game.

2169
02:36:48,158 --> 02:36:51,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can die in Portal, but you don't die in, like, gruesome ways.

2170
02:36:51,721 --> 02:36:53,142
[SPEAKER_06]: No, more like you drown or get shot.

2171
02:36:53,343 --> 02:36:53,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2172
02:36:53,703 --> 02:36:54,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, by lasers.

2173
02:36:54,684 --> 02:36:54,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2174
02:36:55,565 --> 02:36:57,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think about it, Mario...

2175
02:36:59,421 --> 02:37:03,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Only, you know, he dies from drowning in water or falling off a cliff, you know.

2176
02:37:04,206 --> 02:37:07,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Characters die in games, but sometimes it's violent and sometimes it's not.

2177
02:37:08,972 --> 02:37:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: That is finally it!

2178
02:37:12,128 --> 02:37:12,548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

2179
02:37:13,368 --> 02:37:13,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yarp.

2180
02:37:14,209 --> 02:37:15,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I read 11 emails.

2181
02:37:15,389 --> 02:37:20,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Send us more emails.

2182
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:21,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us things to talk about.

2183
02:37:21,732 --> 02:37:25,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, no food incentive for next week, but we'll think of something in the future.

2184
02:37:25,433 --> 02:37:26,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll have a special week.

2185
02:37:26,734 --> 02:37:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But this time, DarkSakura's buying me something, okay?

2186
02:37:28,914 --> 02:37:30,055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

2187
02:37:30,975 --> 02:37:31,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I want tacos.

2188
02:37:31,796 --> 02:37:32,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I want pinkberry.

2189
02:37:33,136 --> 02:37:35,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Send 10 emails so I can get pinkberry.

2190
02:37:35,357 --> 02:37:35,897
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

2191
02:37:36,557 --> 02:37:40,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, everybody knows tacos, but not everybody understands pinkberry.

2192
02:37:41,297 --> 02:37:41,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinkberries.

2193
02:37:41,937 --> 02:37:43,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, we got one last minute email.

2194
02:37:44,518 --> 02:37:45,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's short, so I'll read it.

2195
02:37:45,698 --> 02:37:46,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

2196
02:37:46,638 --> 02:37:49,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I just wanted to chime in so Jamie could get some tacos.

2197
02:37:49,899 --> 02:37:50,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not get tacos.

2198
02:37:51,059 --> 02:37:52,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I got taco, but it was a big taco.

2199
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:53,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That was her request, too.

2200
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:56,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked her what she wanted and she said she wants a fish taco.

2201
02:37:57,061 --> 02:37:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2202
02:37:59,321 --> 02:38:00,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Fish tacos are great.

2203
02:38:01,602 --> 02:38:09,885
[SPEAKER_06]: What is likely one of the main console developers would cease to exist and what is the likelihood new console developers could enter the market?

2204
02:38:10,385 --> 02:38:11,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks guys for a great show as always.

2205
02:38:11,746 --> 02:38:13,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope Jamie gets tacos till her tummy explodes.

2206
02:38:13,866 --> 02:38:16,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your rants and very logical points of view, Loki.

2207
02:38:16,687 --> 02:38:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: This message brought to you by typing on a PSP sucks!

2208
02:38:19,868 --> 02:38:20,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again, guys.

2209
02:38:20,849 --> 02:38:21,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Blade 3.

2210
02:38:23,082 --> 02:38:27,526
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the likelihood that a main console developer would cease to exist?

2211
02:38:27,566 --> 02:38:30,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the likelihood that a new console developer could come in?

2212
02:38:30,568 --> 02:38:33,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm going to go back and use Sega.

2213
02:38:35,192 --> 02:38:36,153
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have Sega.

2214
02:38:36,993 --> 02:38:38,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it Sammy Sega now?

2215
02:38:39,415 --> 02:38:42,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did stop developing consoles.

2216
02:38:43,459 --> 02:38:47,562
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still around, but we don't have them as a console developer anymore.

2217
02:38:49,847 --> 02:38:51,188
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good question.

2218
02:38:52,849 --> 02:38:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to happen right now.

2219
02:38:55,390 --> 02:38:56,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, no.

2220
02:38:57,231 --> 02:38:59,372
[SPEAKER_04]: NEC did the TurboGrafx, right?

2221
02:38:59,392 --> 02:39:00,553
[SPEAKER_04]: But NEC is still around.

2222
02:39:01,313 --> 02:39:04,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, all these companies are still around, but they don't have consoles anymore.

2223
02:39:04,475 --> 02:39:05,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2224
02:39:06,276 --> 02:39:07,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's also, you could go minor.

2225
02:39:08,217 --> 02:39:11,079
[SPEAKER_04]: You could say Philips had the CDI, Apple had the Pippin.

2226
02:39:11,119 --> 02:39:11,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnavox.

2227
02:39:11,779 --> 02:39:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, none of these really made a splash, but they did exist.

2228
02:39:16,922 --> 02:39:17,943
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really hard.

2229
02:39:17,963 --> 02:39:18,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2230
02:39:18,942 --> 02:39:19,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think quite likely.

2231
02:39:21,163 --> 02:39:27,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the ones out now, the real newcomers would be Sony and Microsoft.

2232
02:39:28,466 --> 02:39:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And Apple.

2233
02:39:29,667 --> 02:39:32,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I still say the iBlank is a gaming device.

2234
02:39:33,849 --> 02:39:36,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where a lot of portables are going.

2235
02:39:38,591 --> 02:39:42,533
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the thing is, though, as far as someone exiting...

2236
02:39:43,993 --> 02:39:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the news we've been talking about this week, when it comes to pure sales, none of the systems have been doing terribly.

2237
02:39:50,358 --> 02:39:51,478
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them have tanked.

2238
02:39:52,039 --> 02:39:57,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's usually why a company disappears, because they release a console that just tanks.

2239
02:39:58,703 --> 02:39:59,664
[SPEAKER_06]: That really hasn't happened.

2240
02:39:59,724 --> 02:40:00,925
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really have our big three.

2241
02:40:01,986 --> 02:40:04,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And two of our big three are newcomers within the last...

2242
02:40:09,584 --> 02:40:11,346
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation is about 15 years old, so yeah.

2243
02:40:12,247 --> 02:40:16,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because that came out in 94 or 95.

2244
02:40:19,274 --> 02:40:28,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's additions, well, contributions to the console market, they did the SNES's sound processor.

2245
02:40:29,781 --> 02:40:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's too much for a fourth person to come in, but I think if it's going to be anyone, it's going to be Apple.

2246
02:40:35,605 --> 02:40:42,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to try to sneak their stuff onto your TV through Apple TV and all this stuff more so than they already have.

2247
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:45,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's that Apple's really trying to get into gaming.

2248
02:40:45,771 --> 02:40:46,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple's just in it to make money.

2249
02:40:49,679 --> 02:41:16,683
[SPEAKER_04]: so we'll see but as far as one of the other three going away I don't think so one of them is going to have to release a real stinker for that to happen and I don't see any of them as particularly vulnerable right now but obviously if Nintendo is going a completely different direction with this console could be a risky move especially since 3DS didn't go up to expectations but I don't think the 3DS is doing terribly it's not doing enough where it's going to bankrupt the company yet anyway

2250
02:41:17,042 --> 02:41:18,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was actually, I think, a really good email.

2251
02:41:18,923 --> 02:41:20,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for contributing.

2252
02:41:23,144 --> 02:41:25,205
[SPEAKER_04]: MegaboyX in our chatroom says, Screw Apple!

2253
02:41:25,265 --> 02:41:26,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what a lot of people say.

2254
02:41:26,966 --> 02:41:30,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you just... I mean, facts are facts.

2255
02:41:30,647 --> 02:41:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: iPhone, iPads, iPods, all that shit sells really well.

2256
02:41:34,508 --> 02:41:36,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And games are available on all of them.

2257
02:41:36,529 --> 02:41:40,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough so that Nintendo has had to comment on it and kind of dog the competition.

2258
02:41:41,191 --> 02:41:43,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they are a player.

2259
02:41:44,372 --> 02:41:44,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2260
02:41:45,265 --> 02:41:46,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it for the email bag.

2261
02:41:47,011 --> 02:41:49,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is the part of the show where we're going to get ranty.

2262
02:41:49,339 --> 02:41:50,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the FUs of the week.

2263
02:41:50,804 --> 02:41:50,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Rawr!

2264
02:42:09,188 --> 02:42:14,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my FU goes towards my last week and finals week of school.

2265
02:42:14,711 --> 02:42:18,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of work to get done and not that much time to get it done in.

2266
02:42:19,094 --> 02:42:29,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And my second FU goes towards my really weird bout of exhaustion slash insomnia that's been just making me completely wiped out and kind of burned on everything going on.

2267
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:31,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll figure it out.

2268
02:42:31,721 --> 02:42:33,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably just end of school stress.

2269
02:42:34,182 --> 02:42:34,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2270
02:42:35,083 --> 02:42:35,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

2271
02:42:35,323 --> 02:42:35,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2272
02:42:37,286 --> 02:42:42,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, F you to the upcoming hot that's gonna be coming, uh, this week.

2273
02:42:42,710 --> 02:43:00,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not hot as, you know, what we normally get, uh, but, you know, it's gonna get up to 85 degrees this week, and that's not that bad, but this time of year, though, you know, 85 feels like 105, you know, and then once we hit 105, we're begging for 85, but right now, it feels like 105, so, damn it.

2274
02:43:03,803 --> 02:43:05,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate being hot.

2275
02:43:05,124 --> 02:43:05,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I like being cold.

2276
02:43:06,805 --> 02:43:07,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold's easy.

2277
02:43:07,366 --> 02:43:08,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Put more layers on.

2278
02:43:08,106 --> 02:43:09,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot, can't take more layers off.

2279
02:43:10,488 --> 02:43:11,449
[SPEAKER_03]: You only take so many layers.

2280
02:43:13,370 --> 02:43:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week, I don't know.

2281
02:43:15,031 --> 02:43:16,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have been pretty good, actually.

2282
02:43:16,552 --> 02:43:20,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just FU to me not usually getting enough sleep at night.

2283
02:43:20,955 --> 02:43:22,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I should stop doing that.

2284
02:43:22,977 --> 02:43:24,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, FU to having to work on Saturday.

2285
02:43:25,759 --> 02:43:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely worthy of an FU.

2286
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to get up early on Saturday.

2287
02:43:29,721 --> 02:43:30,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2288
02:43:30,242 --> 02:43:30,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2289
02:43:32,323 --> 02:43:41,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was not forced to come in, but I did it because when people ask me nicely, I tend to do nice things, even though I might not really like them.

2290
02:43:42,872 --> 02:43:43,872
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

2291
02:43:44,553 --> 02:43:46,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into a couple more news stories.

2292
02:43:46,735 --> 02:43:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, the Skype line.

2293
02:43:48,836 --> 02:43:50,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I expected to be ringing off the hook tonight, but we'll see.

2294
02:43:51,258 --> 02:43:54,381
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get into some other news.

2295
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2296
02:43:54,681 --> 02:43:54,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2297
02:43:55,061 --> 02:43:56,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is kind of funny.

2298
02:43:57,802 --> 02:44:00,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most annoying characters ever.

2299
02:44:00,723 --> 02:44:03,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting kind of a return in sort of a gaming form.

2300
02:44:04,944 --> 02:44:10,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft Office's Clippy is getting its own tutorial slash game.

2301
02:44:12,367 --> 02:44:15,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Ribbon Hero 2, Clippy's Second Chance.

2302
02:44:17,348 --> 02:44:22,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a video game slash tutorial to kind of walk you through some of the...

2303
02:44:23,710 --> 02:44:25,732
[SPEAKER_03]: New features of Microsoft Office.

2304
02:44:26,273 --> 02:44:28,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, yes, we've turned Office into a game.

2305
02:44:28,514 --> 02:44:33,799
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to spend time immersed in the inner workings of Office, by golly, it should be fun.

2306
02:44:34,019 --> 02:44:39,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Discover new Office features by actually using them with hint button to fall back on in case you get stuck.

2307
02:44:40,185 --> 02:44:43,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Race for a high score with colleagues, classmates, and friends.

2308
02:44:43,207 --> 02:44:48,192
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put your high score on your resume to show off your Office skills.

2309
02:44:48,552 --> 02:44:49,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recommend doing that.

2310
02:44:50,534 --> 02:44:53,355
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who have been paying attention, we've done this before.

2311
02:44:54,016 --> 02:44:56,758
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we've got the two at the end of the title.

2312
02:44:57,138 --> 02:44:57,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's different?

2313
02:44:58,719 --> 02:45:04,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Clippy, comic strips, colorful graphics, surprise animations, multiple levels, time travel, upside down.

2314
02:45:05,204 --> 02:45:10,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Clippy, spaceships, Greek gods, bow and arrow battles, and tons of useful office features.

2315
02:45:10,967 --> 02:45:14,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Sigh.

2316
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it slow down your computer insanely too?

2317
02:45:17,881 --> 02:45:20,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what Clippy was always best for.

2318
02:45:22,242 --> 02:45:22,562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2319
02:45:22,862 --> 02:45:23,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2320
02:45:23,343 --> 02:45:24,543
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys tonight.

2321
02:45:24,563 --> 02:45:27,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's about a big, big PC game that's set to come out soon.

2322
02:45:28,364 --> 02:45:28,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3.

2323
02:45:29,565 --> 02:45:30,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And when is it coming out?

2324
02:45:30,965 --> 02:45:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some are saying possibly 2011.

2325
02:45:34,146 --> 02:45:37,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hate news stories like this because it kind of seems obvious.

2326
02:45:37,507 --> 02:45:39,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's either coming out this year or next.

2327
02:45:39,328 --> 02:45:40,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no shit.

2328
02:45:40,428 --> 02:45:42,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's what's causing the speculation.

2329
02:45:42,069 --> 02:45:42,309
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

2330
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:42,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been.

2331
02:45:43,009 --> 02:45:44,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either coming out this year or later.

2332
02:45:44,830 --> 02:45:45,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2333
02:45:45,690 --> 02:45:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what's causing the speculation.

2334
02:45:47,212 --> 02:45:50,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, said this to the New York Times.

2335
02:45:51,116 --> 02:45:51,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote,

2336
02:45:57,168 --> 02:46:25,958
[SPEAKER_04]: but I mean for Blizzard shit that could mean anything I hope it's this year I would love to be playing Diablo 3 by Christmas I'm hoping BlizzCon will shed some light on that especially since they're not going to be releasing a WoW expansion this year they may have a StarCraft 2 expansion but otherwise there's nothing for Blizzard to release this year so I sort of hope it is Diablo 3 I would say it's got to release in the well they have a new MMO they're working on yeah but that's not coming out for until like 2013 doesn't mean they can't announce it they can announce it but it won't make them money

2337
02:46:26,398 --> 02:46:26,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2338
02:46:47,250 --> 02:46:51,695
[SPEAKER_04]: People paying to watch what they should be able to see at E3 on TV for free.

2339
02:46:53,637 --> 02:46:56,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love the Blizzard products.

2340
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:59,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't loved them as much since Activision bought them.

2341
02:46:59,723 --> 02:47:02,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, if you want to know more about that, go listen to the other show.

2342
02:47:02,866 --> 02:47:05,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's get into the calls.

2343
02:47:05,469 --> 02:47:09,513
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2344
02:47:09,533 --> 02:47:10,394
[SPEAKER_04]: The phones are open.

2345
02:47:10,834 --> 02:47:30,915
[SPEAKER_04]: PSN, Xbox, whatever you want to talk about in the gaming world give us a call, we'll let you talk for a minute here Kaijudo in our chatroom says I think Diablo 3 is going to be a letdown I really hope not there's a part of me that doesn't want to argue with you because you might be right, but I really hope not I hope you're wrong I think it won't be worth the development time put it that way

2346
02:47:31,860 --> 02:47:33,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

2347
02:47:33,081 --> 02:47:35,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard doesn't really seem to put out bad games, though.

2348
02:47:35,682 --> 02:47:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, StarCraft II is still really good.

2349
02:47:37,643 --> 02:47:41,405
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW has all been great, but then again, Cataclysm did have a lot of problems.

2350
02:47:41,545 --> 02:47:43,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been the weakest WoW expansion so far.

2351
02:47:44,106 --> 02:47:55,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't lived through its life expectancy yet, but so far, it has not WoWed people, ironic, across the spectrum that the other expansions have, I would say.

2352
02:47:56,593 --> 02:48:00,735
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ in chat says, I have zero hopes that it's coming out until it's in my hands!

2353
02:48:03,012 --> 02:48:04,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may be waiting for a little while.

2354
02:48:04,114 --> 02:48:04,434
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2355
02:48:04,895 --> 02:48:06,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

2356
02:48:07,038 --> 02:48:08,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2357
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:08,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2358
02:48:09,743 --> 02:48:10,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Deathwishing.

2359
02:48:10,904 --> 02:48:12,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Deathwishing, how are you?

2360
02:48:13,208 --> 02:48:14,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty good.

2361
02:48:16,733 --> 02:48:17,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to comment.

2362
02:48:18,635 --> 02:48:18,975
[SPEAKER_04]: PSN Stuff

2363
02:48:48,447 --> 02:48:50,829
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?

2364
02:48:50,989 --> 02:49:02,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess PlayStation Network feels that they're obligated to give free stuff on a free service to all the whiny 4chan babies.

2365
02:49:03,597 --> 02:49:06,919
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't think they should be giving anything at all?

2366
02:49:07,019 --> 02:49:11,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I only think they should be giving reimbursements to the people that pay for PlayStation Plus, you know?

2367
02:49:11,722 --> 02:49:15,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that pay for services like DC Online and...

2368
02:49:16,567 --> 02:49:38,271
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, paying customers not like, everyone gets free stuff because you all bitch but we're gonna say we're polite it's, I don't know, it kind of and then the fact that I can't play SOCOM 4 now be honest, are you, now see usually that sort of reaction comes from what you would call a Sony fanboy so be honest, are you a Sony fanboy?

2369
02:49:40,451 --> 02:49:46,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I own all systems, but I really I mean, I kind of like it because I can

2370
02:49:46,567 --> 02:49:48,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Get PlayStation Plus for free now just to try it out.

2371
02:49:48,648 --> 02:49:52,469
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess I kind of am a Sony fanboy.

2372
02:49:52,729 --> 02:49:53,009
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2373
02:49:53,029 --> 02:49:53,429
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

2374
02:49:53,469 --> 02:49:53,709
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

2375
02:49:53,769 --> 02:49:54,009
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2376
02:49:54,309 --> 02:49:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, what did you think of all this, the hacking and all that?

2377
02:49:57,471 --> 02:50:00,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as a Sony fanboy, are you like, this could happen to anyone?

2378
02:50:00,672 --> 02:50:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you like, wow, maybe Sony kind of asked for this?

2379
02:50:03,692 --> 02:50:06,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I first went, wow, holy shit, I can't believe this happened.

2380
02:50:06,633 --> 02:50:14,476
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I saw, oh, we didn't have encrypted stuff, I kind of just went, Sony, you set yourself up to this, you morons.

2381
02:50:15,387 --> 02:50:30,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you would think a company with all this money, with services all, you know, in this age of day that has a service where, okay, we have for the developers, we can buy all each other's games off our PlayStation Network, but we're gonna keep it on the same server, because that's the smart thing to do.

2382
02:50:32,321 --> 02:50:35,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, guys, we're hacked now, and guess what, your credit card's out.

2383
02:50:35,684 --> 02:50:39,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole thing with the way they worked the information, that just pissed me off too, it's like the United States.

2384
02:50:42,423 --> 02:50:43,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I love.

2385
02:50:46,645 --> 02:50:54,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you agree with what we were saying earlier in the show about Sony is just hard-headed?

2386
02:50:56,711 --> 02:50:57,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very much so.

2387
02:50:58,492 --> 02:50:58,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it?

2388
02:50:59,232 --> 02:51:06,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Sony just drunk with power from the rampant success of the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2?

2389
02:51:09,278 --> 02:51:09,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

2390
02:51:10,143 --> 02:51:11,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so that.

2391
02:51:11,344 --> 02:51:20,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what they're trying to, you know, they're too afraid of the 599 US dollar system being, like, compromised, you know?

2392
02:51:22,050 --> 02:51:22,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2393
02:51:22,391 --> 02:51:27,974
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm talking about here, how it's like, oh, we have such an expensive system, oh shit, we fucked up, uh...

2394
02:51:29,818 --> 02:51:34,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that whole not encrypting the data is going to be a real thing that comes back to bite them in the ass.

2395
02:51:34,321 --> 02:51:38,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if this thing does go to trial, that's going to be the piece that screws them.

2396
02:51:38,104 --> 02:51:39,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw the stock prices go down, right?

2397
02:51:40,706 --> 02:51:41,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

2398
02:51:41,927 --> 02:51:43,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course their stock price is going to go down.

2399
02:51:43,928 --> 02:51:45,149
[SPEAKER_01]: It already bit them.

2400
02:51:45,570 --> 02:51:45,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

2401
02:51:46,010 --> 02:51:49,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially how much of big releases for them came out that week, too.

2402
02:51:49,573 --> 02:51:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence me buying actually one of those releases and not being able to play it.

2403
02:51:54,327 --> 02:51:56,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2404
02:51:56,488 --> 02:51:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on with SOCOM right now?

2405
02:51:58,169 --> 02:51:59,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Does SOCOM even have a single player?

2406
02:51:59,911 --> 02:52:00,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It does, right?

2407
02:52:02,912 --> 02:52:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Um... If you can call it that.

2408
02:52:07,355 --> 02:52:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting question.

2409
02:52:08,436 --> 02:52:11,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this comment from Bonds006 in the chatroom.

2410
02:52:11,598 --> 02:52:16,561
[SPEAKER_04]: If any one of us was working in the higher ranks of Sony, would we do something different?

2411
02:52:18,982 --> 02:52:23,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I told... I mean, I was trying to get... If I was in the higher ranks, I would have ran up to the frickin'

2412
02:52:25,074 --> 02:52:28,157
[SPEAKER_01]: IT people in there and punch them all in the dick.

2413
02:52:30,299 --> 02:52:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

2414
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if I were Kaz Harai, I would have promptly fired the person in IT and I would have announced to the world that that's what we did and that's what we're going to change.

2415
02:52:40,607 --> 02:52:41,328
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know.

2416
02:52:43,050 --> 02:52:45,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, yeah, that's I think what I would have done too.

2417
02:52:45,852 --> 02:52:48,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I would have punched them in the dick, but maybe with words.

2418
02:52:48,474 --> 02:52:51,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, they had it coming.

2419
02:52:51,797 --> 02:52:52,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

2420
02:52:52,598 --> 02:52:52,758
[SPEAKER_01]: But,

2421
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:59,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox fanboys, your service did go down for three weeks in 2007 too, so... Three weeks?

2422
02:52:59,942 --> 02:53:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember Xbox being down for three weeks.

2423
02:53:02,603 --> 02:53:03,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Three days, maybe.

2424
02:53:03,363 --> 02:53:03,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in 2007.

2425
02:53:03,983 --> 02:53:08,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do over, like, December, like, a shitload of people rushed online because they got their Xboxes.

2426
02:53:09,411 --> 02:53:10,351
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like three days.

2427
02:53:10,391 --> 02:53:11,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not three weeks.

2428
02:53:11,712 --> 02:53:13,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was three weeks.

2429
02:53:13,192 --> 02:53:13,952
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you're wrong.

2430
02:53:13,972 --> 02:53:17,353
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like three days, three weeks of getting the network back up fully running.

2431
02:53:17,493 --> 02:53:20,714
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get the Xbox fanboys, you need to go to the Red Ring of Death.

2432
02:53:20,794 --> 02:53:22,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, because that was terrible.

2433
02:53:22,835 --> 02:53:26,776
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Microsoft handled it much better than Sony's handling it so far.

2434
02:53:27,656 --> 02:53:28,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.

2435
02:53:29,617 --> 02:53:29,797
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

2436
02:53:30,237 --> 02:53:30,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow.

2437
02:53:30,677 --> 02:53:31,837
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good in the tent.

2438
02:53:31,897 --> 02:53:33,118
[SPEAKER_01]: At least everything may have Prince money.

2439
02:53:33,398 --> 02:53:33,658
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2440
02:53:33,718 --> 02:53:35,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to let you go so we can get more calls.

2441
02:53:35,258 --> 02:53:36,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're breaking up a little bit anyway.

2442
02:53:36,339 --> 02:53:37,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So take care, buddy.

2443
02:53:39,178 --> 02:53:39,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye!

2444
02:54:08,820 --> 02:54:11,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, KNS.

2445
02:54:11,884 --> 02:54:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2446
02:54:12,385 --> 02:54:13,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who's this?

2447
02:54:15,028 --> 02:54:15,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, can you hear me?

2448
02:54:16,029 --> 02:54:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2449
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:17,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who is this?

2450
02:54:17,972 --> 02:54:18,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bad echo.

2451
02:54:18,893 --> 02:54:20,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, that's a problem.

2452
02:54:20,695 --> 02:54:21,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a second.

2453
02:54:21,356 --> 02:54:21,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2454
02:54:22,878 --> 02:54:24,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't expect you guys to pick up that quick.

2455
02:54:24,681 --> 02:54:25,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, we'll hold.

2456
02:54:28,390 --> 02:54:29,130
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2457
02:54:59,285 --> 02:55:27,966
[SPEAKER_04]: forgive me if you already touched on this I was in and out of the room yeah I know there's a lot of news going on in the world it's fine did you weigh in on the show about IGN's little fake or gay article no there was a part of me that didn't want to go there but if the listeners want to go there then fine why don't you do some reporting on this tell us a little bit about what happened and how you feel about it

2458
02:55:29,335 --> 02:55:43,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically IGN took the time to write a little article detailing the sexuality of Yoshi and Turok, of all people.

2459
02:55:45,090 --> 02:56:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically they went through this whole long detailed article explaining that Yoshi is, I believe they used the phrase technically queer or something to that effect because he is dating Birdo who apparently is a transsexual if I got the article right my browser is kind of going slow there for a minute

2460
02:56:16,573 --> 02:56:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so yeah.

2461
02:56:19,297 --> 02:56:22,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told on Twitter that the article was actually written by somebody who is gay.

2462
02:56:24,127 --> 02:56:25,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes it stranger.

2463
02:56:25,387 --> 02:56:26,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

2464
02:56:26,027 --> 02:56:27,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the whole thing weirder.

2465
02:56:27,668 --> 02:56:32,189
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, as I mentioned on Twitter, articles are written to generate hits.

2466
02:56:32,369 --> 02:56:34,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one reason why I wouldn't link it for my Twitter.

2467
02:56:34,470 --> 02:56:36,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.

2468
02:56:36,590 --> 02:56:42,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think these sorts of rampant speculation, I don't know, it just adds fuel to all that stuff.

2469
02:56:42,051 --> 02:56:43,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just unnecessary.

2470
02:56:43,772 --> 02:56:48,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you want to write an interesting article about sexuality, why not talk about, like...

2471
02:56:49,933 --> 02:56:55,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The impact of that, or why are more games kind of not putting it in their storylines?

2472
02:56:55,734 --> 02:57:00,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what is it that gay folks want in gaming?

2473
02:57:00,175 --> 02:57:01,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like interview them.

2474
02:57:01,635 --> 02:57:04,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the same thing as everyone else, to be honest, I'll tell you that.

2475
02:57:04,436 --> 02:57:04,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know.

2476
02:57:05,016 --> 02:57:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an article like that just seemed like so unnecessary.

2477
02:57:07,176 --> 02:57:15,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Or give us an article with a developer for Dragon Age or one of those studios that actually put a gay character in the game about kind of like how they did it and how they made sure...

2478
02:57:15,678 --> 02:57:21,019
[SPEAKER_04]: to kind of address the sensitivity by making it realistic without being a joke.

2479
02:57:21,639 --> 02:57:22,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2480
02:57:23,260 --> 02:57:30,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than like, oh, Birdo's gay because of a misprint that was in an instruction manual so many years ago because they used to rush the translation.

2481
02:57:30,341 --> 02:57:31,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's stupid.

2482
02:57:31,441 --> 02:57:34,662
[SPEAKER_06]: But it actually has been official that Birdo is transgendered.

2483
02:57:35,762 --> 02:57:36,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But still.

2484
02:57:36,602 --> 02:57:40,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that confirmed in Captain Rainbow or something like that?

2485
02:57:40,163 --> 02:57:43,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That Nintendo Wii game that only came out in Japan several years ago?

2486
02:57:45,579 --> 02:57:51,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's plenty of folks that would argue that just because you date somebody who's transsexual doesn't make you one sexuality or another.

2487
02:57:51,284 --> 02:57:53,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people just care too much about who's gay and who's straight.

2488
02:57:54,067 --> 02:57:57,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just love whoever you want to love and be over it, you know?

2489
02:57:58,190 --> 02:57:59,311
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just me.

2490
02:58:02,094 --> 02:58:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for equal rights.

2491
02:58:05,337 --> 02:58:06,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what did you think when you read the article?

2492
02:58:06,898 --> 02:58:10,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it piss you off or were you like, eh, too many people are getting their panties ruffled over this?

2493
02:58:13,052 --> 02:58:26,199
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first saw on IGN's Twitter, when I first saw the title of this, I didn't even have to click on it before I'm thinking, what are they fucking doing?

2494
02:58:26,519 --> 02:58:30,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just seemed like a desperate grab for hits.

2495
02:58:31,830 --> 02:58:34,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unnecessary.

2496
02:58:35,392 --> 02:58:38,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just seemed like pure bullshit to me.

2497
02:58:39,954 --> 02:58:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not an article that they needed to write.

2498
02:58:46,237 --> 02:58:48,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an editorial they needed to write.

2499
02:58:50,159 --> 02:58:55,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at our chatroom here and MegaBoyX is in our chatroom saying, yeah, the guy on IGN came out as gay recently.

2500
02:58:56,241 --> 02:58:58,162
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just trying to write a fun article about it.

2501
02:58:58,382 --> 02:58:59,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2502
02:58:59,022 --> 02:59:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, I'm just kind of like, well, why not write an article about coming out as gay then in gaming culture?

2503
02:59:04,363 --> 02:59:05,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, why not?

2504
02:59:05,864 --> 02:59:08,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, is Yoshi gay?

2505
02:59:08,245 --> 02:59:09,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this so weird?

2506
02:59:09,905 --> 02:59:10,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2507
02:59:10,305 --> 02:59:11,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unnecessary.

2508
02:59:11,465 --> 02:59:12,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unnecessary.

2509
02:59:12,486 --> 02:59:15,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I think, the best thing I can think of to describe it.

2510
02:59:15,187 --> 02:59:16,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just unnecessary.

2511
02:59:18,296 --> 02:59:25,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they were kind of joking about whether Yoshi was a man or a woman in Super Smash Bros.

2512
02:59:26,509 --> 02:59:30,776
[SPEAKER_02]: during Snake and Otacon's conversation before a fight with Yoshi.

2513
02:59:33,497 --> 02:59:41,643
[SPEAKER_02]: and I remember them just bickering back and forth about Buddy lays eggs but it's a boy.

2514
02:59:43,064 --> 02:59:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

2515
02:59:44,024 --> 02:59:47,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we gotta let you go to get some more calls but do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2516
02:59:49,088 --> 02:59:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell Defective Candy thank you for I tell you what I want what I really really want over Twitter.

2517
02:59:55,292 --> 02:59:58,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well I have one final thought for you along those lines.

2518
03:00:04,403 --> 03:00:06,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not Viva Forever.

2519
03:00:30,078 --> 03:00:31,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why you would be buying the collection now.

2520
03:00:32,018 --> 03:00:34,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe because Final Fantasy XIV is still broken.

2521
03:00:34,599 --> 03:00:39,220
[SPEAKER_03]: But Final Fantasy XI, if you happen to want to join that right now, there's actually a good collection they have out there.

2522
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:44,401
[SPEAKER_03]: They updated their Ultimate Collection now with the Abysia Edition.

2523
03:00:44,421 --> 03:00:51,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes basically the game, plus all the expansions, plus the extra Abysia items.

2524
03:00:53,243 --> 03:00:55,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess expansions.

2525
03:00:55,425 --> 03:00:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three add-on scenarios.

2526
03:00:57,226 --> 03:00:57,466
[SPEAKER_03]: All for $20.

2527
03:00:57,807 --> 03:01:01,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki, I want you to point at me and get ready to laugh.

2528
03:01:01,349 --> 03:01:01,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2529
03:01:01,650 --> 03:01:03,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I kind of want to go back and play.

2530
03:01:03,791 --> 03:01:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for a couple weeks.

2531
03:01:05,773 --> 03:01:09,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to relive old times.

2532
03:01:09,235 --> 03:01:10,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Like revisiting an old friend.

2533
03:01:10,556 --> 03:01:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, you do get a special beret that I guess will increase skill gain, extra movement speed, and both magic and health regeneration.

2534
03:01:23,027 --> 03:01:25,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess a new edition will be available to download May 16th.

2535
03:01:27,349 --> 03:01:29,170
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

2536
03:01:29,190 --> 03:01:34,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a small part of me that kind of wants to go hug an old friend.

2537
03:01:37,775 --> 03:01:43,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's rumor that Ocarina of Time 3D is going to be a limited initial release.

2538
03:01:45,340 --> 03:01:45,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

2539
03:01:46,260 --> 03:01:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, other than them being disappointed about the 3DS launch numbers...

2540
03:01:53,283 --> 03:01:55,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that?

2541
03:01:56,067 --> 03:02:00,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it extremely small so that people are trying to find it?

2542
03:02:01,193 --> 03:02:03,215
[SPEAKER_03]: See, Nintendo toys with their customers like that.

2543
03:02:03,496 --> 03:02:04,837
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of company they are.

2544
03:02:05,118 --> 03:02:05,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

2545
03:02:06,139 --> 03:02:06,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you what.

2546
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll free up one extra copy for those people looking for it because I'm not buying it.

2547
03:02:14,818 --> 03:02:30,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, if you don't like Madden, yet you still want a football game, All Pro Football 2K8, there's an editor that's been released for it, for the Xbox 360 version, using some file editing.

2548
03:02:30,489 --> 03:02:32,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can be done on non-modded consoles, by the way.

2549
03:02:34,132 --> 03:02:36,594
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually update your rosters.

2550
03:02:37,374 --> 03:02:39,696
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also create custom teams.

2551
03:02:40,356 --> 03:02:44,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess adjusting stats and players and all that stuff.

2552
03:02:45,240 --> 03:02:51,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratings, abilities, physical appearance, and basically create your own teams if you want.

2553
03:02:52,906 --> 03:02:55,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Or base them off of the actual NFL teams.

2554
03:02:57,609 --> 03:03:00,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure All-Pro Football 2K8 is probably dirt cheap nowadays.

2555
03:03:00,592 --> 03:03:00,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2556
03:03:03,755 --> 03:03:08,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in that, check out operationsports.com.

2557
03:03:08,161 --> 03:03:09,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a feature running on it.

2558
03:03:09,462 --> 03:03:13,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Flying Finn Releases All-Pro Football 2K8 Editor.

2559
03:03:15,765 --> 03:03:16,145
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2560
03:03:41,167 --> 03:03:45,618
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what do we talk about for a few more minutes while we wait for the phones to ring?

2561
03:03:45,638 --> 03:03:47,002
[SPEAKER_06]: This is such a funny image.

2562
03:03:49,054 --> 03:03:53,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one of the... Yeah, someone finally did like a little image of Obama.

2563
03:03:53,297 --> 03:03:55,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, sorry it took so long to get you a copy of my birth certificate.

2564
03:03:55,878 --> 03:03:57,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I was too busy killing Osama Bin Laden.

2565
03:03:58,360 --> 03:03:59,200
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

2566
03:03:59,860 --> 03:04:00,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2567
03:04:01,641 --> 03:04:01,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2568
03:04:02,342 --> 03:04:06,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to... I have things I want to say, but I don't want to get too political on the show.

2569
03:04:06,864 --> 03:04:12,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just... I just hope that this will be the first step in this all being over.

2570
03:04:13,528 --> 03:04:14,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I'll say on that.

2571
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:17,110
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2572
03:04:18,331 --> 03:04:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess that's it.

2573
03:04:20,793 --> 03:04:21,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done.

2574
03:04:21,333 --> 03:04:23,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and close up the lines.

2575
03:04:23,755 --> 03:04:26,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1230 on the East Coast anyway, so we're done.

2576
03:04:26,937 --> 03:04:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2577
03:04:29,499 --> 03:04:30,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, let me also say this.

2578
03:04:32,542 --> 03:04:37,265
[SPEAKER_04]: If you liked Orange Lounge Radio, if you like the show here, do help spread the word about the show.

2579
03:04:37,585 --> 03:04:40,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend or a nice five-star review on iTunes is great too.

2580
03:04:41,028 --> 03:04:42,989
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some really nice ones written in the past couple days.

2581
03:04:43,069 --> 03:04:43,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it, you guys.

2582
03:04:44,290 --> 03:04:46,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I do read them and they make me smile, so thank you guys so much.

2583
03:04:46,972 --> 03:04:48,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Very much for those that leave those.

2584
03:04:49,033 --> 03:04:49,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.

2585
03:04:50,054 --> 03:04:51,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go around and give everybody's final thought.

2586
03:04:52,155 --> 03:04:54,756
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2587
03:04:56,057 --> 03:04:57,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2588
03:04:57,978 --> 03:04:59,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Portal 2 is pretty awesome.

2589
03:04:59,859 --> 03:05:00,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Chapter 2.

2590
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:01,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting into it.

2591
03:05:03,041 --> 03:05:05,703
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is ice cream.

2592
03:05:07,143 --> 03:05:07,464
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2593
03:05:07,924 --> 03:05:08,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2594
03:05:08,664 --> 03:05:10,125
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Baskin Robbins around the corner.

2595
03:05:10,485 --> 03:05:13,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but they'll be closed by the time we're done with Afterbirth and all that.

2596
03:05:13,769 --> 03:05:14,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it guys.

2597
03:05:14,889 --> 03:05:16,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for listening to the show.

2598
03:05:16,590 --> 03:05:20,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope that PSN comes back in the next week and maybe we'll forget about it by next week.

2599
03:05:21,132 --> 03:05:21,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Likely not.

2600
03:05:21,992 --> 03:05:25,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the latest in gaming news and all the good stuff and your voices.

2601
03:05:26,014 --> 03:05:27,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, same bat time, same bat channel.

2602
03:05:28,014 --> 03:05:28,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week.

2603
03:05:28,735 --> 03:05:29,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks everybody.

2604
03:05:30,055 --> 03:05:32,756
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
