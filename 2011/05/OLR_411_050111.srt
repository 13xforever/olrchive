00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,260
Today, May 1st, 2011, the PlayStation Network remains down after an entire week, Portal

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:31,900
2 plans free DLC and Nintendo plans a free game from the 3DS shop.

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,200
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:47,280
We are live with episode number 411, the 411 if you will, on this May 1st of 2011.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,300
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, with

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,560
me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,960
I will not put you in a potato.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Thank you.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
And feed you two birds.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
That's great.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,680
Actually it's kind of funny because I saw, I was at Trader Joe's today, which by the

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,000
way, super crowded grocery store today, it was a madhouse, and there was some hash browns

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,120
that were on sale and the little label on it says, when I grow up, I want to be hash

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,620
browns and I couldn't help but think of, you know, the same thing.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,880
So anyhow.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,400
I gave inadvertent spoilers today, sorry.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,440
And the one she was spoiling of course was the one and only tech master, Loki!

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,840
I asked, so it's alright.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
That's right, yeah.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,320
Let's keep the show spoiler free guys, don't worry about it.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
How you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm doing fine.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,040
And long time no see, it's been a little while because we were off two weeks ago and then

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,440
last week, Easter week, you were like, oh, I gotta do family stuff because I have a baby

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,480
now, so family stuff's important, so whatever, Loki.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
So, well how's it going?

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
It's going alright.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,320
Any, uh, anything exciting going on with the baby and that whole stuff?

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,000
He's scooting forward now, which means he'll be crawling hopefully soon.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,120
Awesome.

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
I saw the video.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
He looks so proud of himself.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,680
He is very proud of himself.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,680
He's like, I can move!

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,400
Just wait till I start walking!

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,900
Today he learned how to smack mommy in the face when she's not listening and gave her

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,900
a bloody nose.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Oh no.

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
What?

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Oh no.

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,080
No, he, he just got, he gets excited sometimes and he, he's like flails around and you know.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,040
He still doesn't have fine motor control.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,400
Whoever's holding him is, you know, subjected to the brunt of his attack.

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Has he tugged on your face?

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,560
No, he does it all the time.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,800
Alright well, we're going to start off the show of course with how was your gaming week

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,320
and the video games you've been playing this week.

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,920
However, I do want to of course introduce the chat room because they're always there

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
with us.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,780
You can go to chat.orangelauntrader.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,400
where gamers seem to be very opinionated this week.

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,520
I can't possibly imagine what could possibly have so many people with so many polarizing

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
opinions.

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,000
It couldn't be that we're on day 11 of a certain network being down, which is certainly the

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
longest anything like this has ever happened.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,600
Oh my god, UPN's down?

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
UPN's down?

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,520
UPN merged with C, what is it, Warner Brothers years ago, just so you know.

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,640
Alright, anyhow.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,560
All that aside, certainly, we'll get into that, but first, a little lighter fare, how

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,640
was your gaming week and what games you've been playing this week?

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
DarkSakura.

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,680
I've been playing a lot of stuff.

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,360
I played DDR on Wednesday, I went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza, which was actually

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,100
pretty good.

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,320
So I cannot call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza anymore.

68
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,400
It was Julian's 4th birthday, and so we did the twister and everything, and he was a big

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,560
boy and went on that.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
It was actually pretty good.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
It was actually really good.

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,340
They're Alfredo Pizza, it was pretty good.

74
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,820
How long has it been since you've had pizza?

75
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,860
It was pretty good.

76
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,280
Because I managed to get those both when they were fresh, the pizzas I had.

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm a pizza snob and I think their pizza's terrible, but that's because I haven't had

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
it in a while.

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
But anyway.

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Foodio.

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I like the macaroni and cheese pizza.

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
By the way, speaking of food, would you please tell the listeners what you had before the

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,920
show tonight?

84
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
I had a fish taco.

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
Thank you, Rob, for my taco.

86
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,640
And dammit people, I asked for more than 10, not more than 30.

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,960
And yeah, if you have no idea why Dark Soccer was rewarded with a taco earlier tonight,

88
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,200
you have to listen to last week's show.

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,840
I just like that I completely bullshitted you into getting me a taco.

90
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,120
I was kind of fucked up.

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
Next time I want something.

92
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Rob.

93
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
What?

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,440
How about after the show I get you paintberry?

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,560
That would be amazing if I didn't have work in the morning, and I already foresee this

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
show running long.

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
Okay, how about after my finals are done?

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Okay.

99
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
We go celebrate at paintberry.

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
My treat.

101
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
That works for me.

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Okay.

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Sorry, back to games.

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll buy Alan some too.

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Okay.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
So.

107
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,880
I played some Ditter, and I played this percussion master game that's supposed to be like Taiko

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
no Tatsujin, only it's a lot different and kind of sucky, and had really bad covers of

109
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
songs in there.

110
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,320
But I had fun playing it.

111
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,960
And then I played After Burner Climax in the arcade, because that's the only arcade machine

112
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,880
I've seen, and I love that game.

113
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,840
Did it make you climax?

114
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,160
No, but I was moist.

115
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,720
Because, you know, I just got done playing DDR, I was like, okay.

116
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,600
And then I got Portal 2, which I got two days ago.

117
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,240
I got it Friday night.

118
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,320
And I'm already almost caught up with you, because I had bad insomnia.

119
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,520
My problem is that I'm only playing it on Steam, because, you know, I'm kind of glad

120
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:41,200
I don't have the Playstation 1, because of certain malfunctions, and excuse me while

121
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,320
I clean something up off the floor.

122
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,760
So, and because, you know, I honestly wouldn't have played it on the console anyway, so I'm

123
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,620
really digging playing it on Steam.

124
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,520
I play with a trackball mouse, which I'm having a good time.

125
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,040
But yeah, I have just found, well, it's a little bit of a spoiler, but I don't care,

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
I'll say it anyway.

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,360
It's called potatoes.

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,280
As they refer to her on the Half-Life Wiki as potatoes.

129
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,040
So it's been pretty cool.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,560
You've heard me bitching about puzzles that make me violently ill.

131
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey, it's my husband, I think.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, it's a visitor.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a friend.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,680
Anyway, so, uh, I also, uh, crap, what else did I play?

135
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,880
I played some Dragon Age, but I'm kind of forgetting about Dragon Age for now.

136
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm gonna go ahead and give it back, because I've got Portal, although I'm probably gonna

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,240
end up having it beaten, like, in the next couple days.

138
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,580
And I got level 60, um, for Rebecca Black.

139
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
On WoW.

140
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
On WoW.

141
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
World of Warcraft.

142
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,960
You still have to play co-op, because co-op's a lot of fun, too.

143
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Co-op WoW?

144
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
No, co-op Portal, dummy.

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,680
Don't call me dummy dummy.

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,880
I booted Darwinia.

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,800
But Portal, I'm kind of like, oooh, it's pretty.

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
It really is pretty.

149
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
I've been taking tons of screen captures, because my favorite thing in this game so

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,960
far are the, um, the work posters that are like, but for me being, you know, a big graphic

151
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,960
design nerd, I love how perfectly they capture the styles of each era, you know, the further

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,920
along that you're in the facility, like the stuff from the 40s and 50s, and then the 60s

153
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,600
style logo, and as you move up through the facility, and you come to the modern age,

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,600
you see just, they really did capture the design of those different eras really nicely.

155
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,520
And I love the allergen poster.

156
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,240
It's like, know your allergens.

157
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Pollen.

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Pet dander.

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Plastic.

160
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Antimatter.

161
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:55,280
And the, the, the, please let us know if you see anyone from the FDA, the FHA.

162
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,620
There's lots of great little jokes just in the artwork, and that's, that's, you know,

163
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,760
part of what makes this game so phenomenal is that, you know, there's just, you can just

164
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,440
be kind of walking around looking at the scenery, and it's not just the, you know, very similar

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
to the first game.

166
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Remember how they were like the cave drawing type of things?

167
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Which are still there.

168
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Yeah, they're there, and you know, they're not totally throughout, but you find them

169
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
in certain places.

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Well, you know why?

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
The signs or jokes do.

172
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,960
You know why they're not fully, fully through there?

173
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
Can you tell me without spoiling?

174
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Well read the lab rat comic.

175
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Okay, alright.

176
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,520
There's a comic that ties Portal to Portal 2 called Lab Rat.

177
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,680
It's a free PDF.

178
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,120
You can get it on the Valve website, and it talks about Ratman, who was the guy that was

179
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,040
living in the facilities hiding, and he apparently was a scientist, and was, he's the reason

180
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,320
that Chella's the one being tested.

181
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,600
Because while she wasn't the smartest or the most athletic, she had the most tenacity.

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,040
And it says on her, never ever gives up.

183
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,880
So she was initially rejected as a test subject.

184
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
And he moved her forward.

185
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
And this is all in the comic.

186
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Yeah, all in the comic.

187
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,360
So you're just spoiling the comic, not the game.

188
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Well, there's more to it.

189
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,140
Like there's a lot more to Ratman, and there's a lot more to her, and just different stuff

190
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
that goes on in there.

191
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,180
So it's actually pretty, it's a good little tie-in, and also if you haven't seen the restored

192
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,240
ending for Portal, that ties in as well.

193
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,320
Coming into our chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Defective Candy is sad.

194
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,840
I'm poor, I can't buy Portal.

195
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,280
You're probably not alone.

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,480
And it's inevitable there will be a huge sale on Steam at some point.

197
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,200
And I would anticipate it's probably going to be around the time the first batch of download

198
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,520
content comes out.

199
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,000
It will be, you know, hey, are you still not on Portal?

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,160
Get it now, half off.

201
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
Because Valve likes to do ridiculous sales.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you know, not all the news is bad.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Portal's ten bucks right now.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The only, well, I mean, Portal 2.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah, Portal 2, yeah.

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Well everybody can, you know, just watch their retail stores because they're doing POS backend

207
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,400
rebates for retailers through now and I think June?

208
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,460
Or the end of June?

209
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,340
So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing it down to 30 or 40 bucks.

210
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,960
What is a POS backend?

211
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,520
POS backend rebate means point of sale, so each, basically they get it for cheaper.

212
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Each one they sell, they track how many they sell and they get a rebate from the publisher

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
for it.

214
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,200
So it's an incentive to get them to bring in more product because they get to sell it

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
for cheaper.

216
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
Just sort of like buying a mask, buying bulk, right?

217
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
Well, sort of.

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,040
That's what happened with those, the five retailers that had the Wii systems for $170

219
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
because that wasn't offered to everybody.

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,860
That was only the top five direct retailers got offered that.

221
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,840
But with Portal 2, it's a little bit flexible, so they're getting a week where they get the

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
market down.

223
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,780
So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing down different weeks from

224
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,960
now to the end of June.

225
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,360
Tiger Claw says, let's not forget about Cave Johnson.

226
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,080
He has some of the funniest stuff.

227
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,520
I love him and I didn't realize it at first, but it's the dude that played J. Jonah Jameson

228
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,320
in the Spiderman movies and he's perfect.

229
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:16,160
And I love Carolyn, which I won't say anything more about her, but I knew right away it was

230
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,640
the same voice actor.

231
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,360
So I love her speaking voice, but I love listening to her sing.

232
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,240
Not just the Jonathan Colton songs, but singing like she actually did the opera.

233
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
She's an operatic singer.

234
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,520
So I've actually gone back and listened to her sing other stuff and her voice is astounding.

235
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,800
Really, really gorgeous.

236
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,800
So really most of my time has been taken up with Portal 2.

237
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,240
For all of my motion sickness, I have been breezing through it, except for the parts

238
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,280
that I scream and yell at, which are usually, oh my God, I threw up.

239
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,040
You said something on Facebook the other night about having played for a little bit, but

240
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,060
got too motion sick and you had to quit.

241
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,520
And I was kind of like, oh, she probably only got, you know, maybe she got through like

242
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,080
the first two chapters or something.

243
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
But no, I'm here tonight.

244
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
You're already on chapter seven.

245
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Yeah.

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
I just started chapter seven.

247
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
So you almost caught up to me.

248
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
I just got to chapter eight last night.

249
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
So.

250
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,880
Which I'm just a few stages away from that really.

251
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,500
And I'm, I'm totally digging it.

252
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,360
The last fight though, I'm, I'm not going to spoil it because I did actually watch play

253
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,680
throughs a few times.

254
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,180
The last fight looks freaking difficult, but fun too at the same time.

255
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,680
So I'm looking forward to that.

256
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
All right.

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,760
Well, uh, if that does it for dark soccer's gaming week, then let's go to Loki and ask

258
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Loki.

259
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
How was your gaming week?

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,080
Um, I didn't play a lot of anything actually just grand theft auto really cause I've been

261
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,440
playing, um, well I've been editing stuff in grand theft auto.

262
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,560
That's all I really been doing the last two weeks.

263
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,800
Um, well actually I did play like a few other small things, just mainly, um, play a little

264
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,580
bit of unpleasant horse, which is the new iOS game from, um, pop cap.

265
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,600
It's their, um, kind of spin off company that's doing it.

266
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,960
And it's funny because I don't know if there's more of these types of games coming.

267
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,480
I think there are, um, it's free, but what the premise of the game, the way they came

268
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,440
up with it is they had a hat with a bunch of random names in it, just different parts

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
of a name.

270
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,400
And so they pull out the name for the game and they have 48 hours to complete the, you

271
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
know, coding the game.

272
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,040
And so the premise of unpleasant horse is you're this unpleasant looking unicorn fat

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,700
chubby horse and, uh, you fly around or hop from cloud to cloud trying to land on happy

274
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:45,680
white, um, unicorn horses or whatever Pegasus is, I guess, and you crush them and make them

275
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,240
fall into meat grinders.

276
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
That's it.

277
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
It's hilarious.

278
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,560
Um, but yeah, definitely worth checking out since it's free and it's fun, especially if

279
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,640
you like horse violence like I do.

280
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
So that's it.

281
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,440
Well, you know, we covered, um, was it fourth and battery?

282
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,400
We covered that on the show a few weeks ago.

283
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Right?

284
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Yeah.

285
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,760
No, I remember the story about how it took a little while for them to get on the store,

286
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,880
but yeah, I didn't even realize the game had actually come out.

287
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,000
I, last I'd heard it had been delayed, so that's cool.

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And then, um, let's see what else, uh, it was a really cool, actually I just real quick,

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,240
there was a really cool story in the, um, I was making the rounds on the blogs this

290
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,960
week and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'll mention it here.

291
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,920
I hear that PopCap designed some game as part of a make a wish thing for a nine year old.

292
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I thought that was very cool.

293
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,680
Yeah, I think that's out there now to games of the aisle store too.

294
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
It's very cool.

295
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm trying to think other stuff.

296
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:48,520
Oh, I was going to mod my laptop because, um, these wonderful aces laptops are not meant

297
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,920
for proper cooling and so I'm modding the back of it so I can play some more graphic

298
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,480
intensive games without feeling like my lap is on fire.

299
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,040
Um, and then, uh, let's see, other than gaming, I mentioned a few weeks back, and this is

300
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,720
really hilarious, um, how I was taking a test or whatever to get into Mensa while I passed

301
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
that test.

302
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,280
So I'm in Mensa now.

303
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Congrats.

304
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know what to say.

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So now what?

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
What do you do as a Mensa member?

307
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,280
Because now is that going to be your thing now?

308
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,120
Your little MO on the show is that, well Rob, as a, as a member of Mensa, I think my opinion

309
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
matters here.

310
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I need to tell you.

311
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Nothing.

312
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,920
I just want the plaque or whatever.

313
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Your resume, right?

314
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes.

315
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
You're wondering.

316
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Hang it up in your office.

317
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
It's basically, yeah.

318
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
There you go.

319
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't know.

320
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,240
I can attend a seminar if I want to or something, but go hang out with all the smart people.

321
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,600
All I can say is I can analyze games.

322
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Where's your Mensa placard?

323
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Fucking Michael Pachter.

324
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Yeah, that's right.

325
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,040
I don't think you have one.

326
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
I guess my opinion means a little bit more than yours, so.

327
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Nice.

328
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,840
Um, I was going to say you need to go to one of these Mensa conventions and I want to see

329
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
some Mensa hotties.

330
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Mensa hotties?

331
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,360
I want to see a blog of Mensa hotties.

332
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,640
You're going to be all like looking like librarians, I bet.

333
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,040
That's now that's a stereotype, Dark Sakura.

334
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
That is a stereotype.

335
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Vicious stereotype.

336
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Does Loki look like a librarian?

337
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
I don't look like a librarian.

338
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,040
I was talking about the women, but okay.

339
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Librarians are hot though.

340
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,280
No, it's just, I just, I don't even know why I took the test.

341
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,040
Sara Palin was kind of hot until she opened her mouth.

342
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,340
Anyway.

343
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,340
That all depends.

344
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,040
I mean, your opinion of Sara Palin, I mean, it might be even hotter if she opened her

345
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,340
mouth, but then when she started talking though, then that just went downhill.

346
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,040
Some people like them stupid, I guess.

347
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
No, I, I don't know.

348
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I just thought it was funny.

349
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
But yeah.

350
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
All right.

351
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk about my gaming week.

352
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Oh, and I just did a, sorry, sorry.

353
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
I just did a street pass thing with Rob.

354
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,040
So now I actually have two me's on my 3DS now.

355
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Yay.

356
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,940
That's the first time my 3DS is street pass.

357
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
You know, it's awesome.

358
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,740
I talked about getting the 3DS on the show last week.

359
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
You know, it's awesome.

360
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
I went to the mall yesterday.

361
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,520
I went to the mall in the really nice part of town where all the spoiled rich kids are.

362
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I went there.

363
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,020
I went to Best Buy.

364
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,340
I went to some other stores and I was like, oh, I've got a street pass with someone.

365
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,540
If it's like the demo unit in Best Buy, I'm going to street pass with someone before this

366
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
day's over.

367
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,840
I get home and I see, oh, uh, apparently the wireless was turned off the entire time.

368
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,080
That was really smart of me because you know, they put the wireless switch on the 3DS exactly

369
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,440
where they put the power switch on the old DS's.

370
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Yeah.

371
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
God damn it.

372
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Anyhow.

373
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:42,040
Oh, apparently I'm getting a link from Derek H in our chat room is actually linking us

374
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:50,800
to this, uh, website here as a part of cha cha.com I like this, uh, hot Mensa members.

375
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,040
And it's actually a link of some hot people that are Mensa members, some celebrities.

376
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,480
Well, I guarantee I'm not part of that list.

377
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,200
You are not because all these people have tits, Loki.

378
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,240
You do not have tits.

379
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
That's true.

380
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,200
Derek H, Gina Davis, Asia Carrera.

381
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
She's pretty hot.

382
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Uh, she's not hot.

383
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,760
Well, Gina Davis is just getting old.

384
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
She was really hot.

385
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Like 20 years ago.

386
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Well, that's 20 years ago.

387
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Anyhow.

388
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
What the hell?

389
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,480
Why do they have a little kid on there?

390
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
That's just weird.

391
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
All right.

392
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Let's move on.

393
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,400
Uh, my gaming week, more of the same, uh, portal, of course, portal to, as I mentioned

394
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
before, I'm a chapter.

395
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,760
I also play some co-op, uh, obviously not on PSM, but I played on steam, which was a

396
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
lot of fun.

397
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,400
And, uh, you know, we weren't using voice chat at all because, uh, I was playing with

398
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,740
Miek Latov and the way his place is set up, he couldn't talk cause he would wake someone

399
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,000
up who was sleeping.

400
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,600
So, uh, I was, I was playing with him and we were using the text chat to type back and

401
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
forth.

402
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
And then portal also has, if you use like the F key, you can like point at things like

403
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,000
telling people where to put the portals.

404
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So it was nice.

405
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,680
And like when I would get really frustrated, I'd hit F like a thousand times on the point

406
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,160
where I want to, you know, have him put a portal.

407
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
So that was fun.

408
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
I like that.

409
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
You each have a terminus?

410
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Uh, yeah.

411
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Oh yeah.

412
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
You each, it's like four portals.

413
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,600
All the co-op puzzles are four portals because you each have a portal guy.

414
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,280
So it's not like one's not the orange and the other's the blue.

415
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Nope.

416
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,440
One's dark blue and light blue and the other one's dark orange and like, or I should say

417
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,500
light orange and red sort of thing.

418
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
So yeah.

419
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,120
I know that, um, in the original portal back, if you look at the beta pictures of it, they

420
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,180
had a purple and pink portal originally.

421
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,280
I was wondering if they maybe had borrowed the same scheme.

422
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Perhaps.

423
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I'm sure there's lots of ideas.

424
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,180
Well, you know, at one point portal two wasn't even supposed to be half portals.

425
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,920
That was one thing they were talking about was that it was going to be a whole new concept

426
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
in their game.

427
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,480
But actually that's where the gels come from, where there's like there's blue gels and orange

428
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
gels and white gels.

429
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,000
They got that from another game that was done by some more students at DigiPen.

430
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Really?

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,160
Um, that and there's only one gel that they didn't take from that game that is like a

432
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
sticky, I think.

433
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
I'd have to look it up again.

434
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,680
But yeah, they took the repulsion and propulsion gel from another game and they actually hired

435
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,040
them all to help work with portal two.

436
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,160
The white gel is portal wall gel.

437
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Yeah.

438
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Moon rocks!

439
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,400
You can have a portal wherever you want.

440
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,560
So yeah, that wasn't supposed to have portals, but yeah, the game is still fun, exciting.

441
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Co-op mode is great.

442
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,520
I haven't beat it yet, but we're probably like, I don't know, like think we're through

443
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,400
three of the areas.

444
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,040
So I think there's like five or six.

445
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,360
Been playing a little bit of Mortal Kombat, but not a lot.

446
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,680
A little more Street Fighter on the 3DS, but not a lot.

447
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,960
The one new game I've been playing a lot of this week is the Final Fantasy IV collection

448
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
on the PSP.

449
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,160
You might've forgot because it came out on a huge week, but that game came out and it's

450
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,840
redone versions of Final Fantasy IV, which of course was originally released as Final

451
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,640
Fantasy II in the United States, but it's IV in the canon.

452
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,300
It is not only the original Final Fantasy IV game redone.

453
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:55,160
It is redone in the style of Final Fantasy I and II on the PSP or I and II on the iPhone,

454
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,040
which was taken from the PSP versions, not III, which was taken from the DS versions.

455
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,200
But IV has been reimagined like I and II were with redone sprites, redone music.

456
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,360
Really cool though, you can go in and enable the original music if you'd like to hear that.

457
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,400
It's the modern translation, not the original Ted Woosley one from the 90s that's out.

458
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
You spoonie bard!

459
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,080
Well, they keep that line in, they have to keep that line in, but the rest is the proper

460
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,040
story with all the proper text for everything.

461
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,640
And it also has the After Years, the complete set of the After Years games, which were released

462
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,120
for several bucks a pop on the Wii, and did not have souped up graphics at all, it was

463
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,260
just the same graphics from the original Super Nintendo version.

464
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,980
So it's pretty cool that they released all that in one package, and it has a transition

465
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,400
episode that's completely brand new that transitions between the two games.

466
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,480
So all of it is new, very cool.

467
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,200
It's beautiful looking, I love that it's still 2D, like I don't hate the 3D one on the DS,

468
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
I mean it was great and I'm glad they did that, but it's nice to kind of play it still

469
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,440
the old school way, just with all the souped up graphics, like I wish this is what we could

470
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,160
get more of on like Arcade or Virtual Console for fuck's sake, like this would be a great

471
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
thing for them to have released.

472
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,080
But it works great on the PSP, looks beautiful, different transition graphics for the battles,

473
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,960
the battles look great, the magic's all been redone so it looks very high def and everything.

474
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
It's great, I'm really enjoying it, it's a great value for a Final Fantasy fan.

475
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,320
You know if you're not into the older Final Fantasy games, you don't really have the same

476
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,260
appreciation for them, I don't know if there will be a lot here for you.

477
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,880
I have a bad feeling it's not going to sell very well because I think it just came out

478
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,760
at a real crap time.

479
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,880
Hopefully it will sell a bit in catalog sales, I really want to see 5 and 6 get the same

480
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,760
retreatment, especially 6, it will be very nice.

481
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,120
So hopefully they'll sell a lot of 4.

482
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,180
And that's the other game I've been playing.

483
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,120
So that's really been about it, oh no, one other game I played, this is very important

484
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,080
because I promised last week on the show I would finally try it and I did, I played Minecraft.

485
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,240
And I gotta say Minecraft, the website is not, I'm going to just be honest, this is

486
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,440
my true reaction, a lot of people are going to think I'm an idiot and that's fine, but

487
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
I'll own up to it.

488
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,840
I did not find the Minecraft site to be very user friendly because it took me a minute

489
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,240
to kind of figure out there's like an old version that's free or there's an old multiplayer

490
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,000
or there's a new one that you can pay for and a new multiplayer, there's so many different

491
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,960
modes and the website's kind of dated looking and whatever.

492
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,960
So I finally found my way into the game and I played it and I don't get it, I don't get

493
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
the big deal.

494
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,720
Sorry guys, I don't understand why people are hailing Minecraft, it's like oh my god!

495
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Maybe it's more fun with more people or whatever, but I found it to be about as thrilling as

496
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,640
the program from Lego that lets you build your own Lego structures and then you can

497
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,280
order the bricks and actually build them.

498
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,200
Don't get me wrong, that's kind of awesome too, but I did not think Minecraft was like

499
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
OMG!

500
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
I agree with you.

501
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Did you play it too?

502
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,000
I've played Minecraft, I didn't care for it.

503
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And that made me kind of sick.

504
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,200
Well, yeah, I mean, but you've got the whole first person shooter thing going on that you

505
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,160
don't usually do well with those.

506
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,720
But I just, I didn't get it.

507
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,040
I don't think it's put together very well either, I think it's not presented very well.

508
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,120
I guess it's one of those like hipster things that like if you're into it you're hip because

509
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:24,920
it's like hard to get in there and play and all that and build these things, whatever.

510
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,520
For some reason I was reminded of a really old game on the Super Nintendo called Populous

511
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,920
where you could kind of build, and this is also on, I want to say like Amiga, I think

512
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,640
it was originally an Amiga game, and obviously I had a PC port at some point too, and you

513
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,480
like raised and lowered land to keep your people safe and you kind of like played god

514
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
so to speak.

515
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,760
I don't know why, but with the whole like building blocks and then taking them away,

516
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,360
I felt very populist to me.

517
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,360
And I got to admit like all these people are like hailing it, it's this great thing.

518
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,820
I feel like I've played something like it before, I didn't feel that innovative to me.

519
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,000
So sorry, I guess that makes me not cool, I'm not hip.

520
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's okay Rob, we forgive you.

521
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Anyhow.

522
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't think it's cool either.

523
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,260
Moving on, other housekeeping, you can always join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange

524

If you want to follow us there, and of course check us out on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

527
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
No shows we're taking off in the foreseeable future.

528
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,760
We do have our ninth anniversary show coming up at the end of June, but that's still a

529
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,040
good six weeks away, so we'll give you more details on that as we get closer.

530
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,080
For now, let's get into gaming news, or as I should say, you have to remember what OLR

531
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
is all about.

532
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,640
We don't, it's very, very, very, very rare we ever break news on this show.

533
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,760
A lot of times, you know, we like to be friends, sitting around the table, talking smack about

534
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
games.

535
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,400
So sometimes it's about putting the news out there on the table to discuss.

536
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,880
So I don't think this is going to be news to anyone, but we need to put it out there

537
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
on the table.

538
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,720
So Loki, please, let's address the pink elephant in the room.

539
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Whoa, whoa, wait a second, PlayStation network's been down?

540
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,480
Yes, it's been down.

541
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,760
I don't know if you've actually bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 or Mortal Kombat, which

542
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,440
were huge, huge releases on PS3 the week you were out, and now you can't play either of

543
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
them online.

544
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah.

545
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,400
I've never used PlayStation network, but yeah, it's been down for a while.

546
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:33,080
And you know, they even, they even went and had a press conference yesterday, ooh, press

547
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,520
conference, making everything official.

548
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,920
You know, hey, don't fear, everything's going to be okay.

549
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,240
But yeah, apparently they're going to be returning some services to the PlayStation network this

550
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,000
week, full services within this month.

551
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,800
And I just need to interrupt and say something, because this is really important, Loki.

552
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Part of, you know, kind of the thing that, you know, with the hack and everything is

553
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,800
that credit card data was exposed, or at least they say possibly could have been compromised,

554
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,640
which hadn't come out at the time of last week's show.

555
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,000
And I just want to say, I called it, and I really hate being right sometimes.

556
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,720
That's the second time this year I've been right on some major news.

557
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
The other one we'll get to in a little bit, because I've not had a chance to gloat with

558
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,440
Loki here on the show, but I'll get my fair share in just after we cover this story.

559
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,960
All right, yeah, so the list of services that are returning to the PlayStation network this

560
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,840
week are the restoration of online gameplay across the PlayStation 3 and PSP systems,

561
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,360
licenses, including titles that require online verification and download games, access to

562
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,720
music unlimited power by curiosity, which I might add, curiosity is a terrible name

563
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:52,480
for a service, so thanks, Sony, for coming up with a new word that begins with Q.

564
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
Access to account management and password reset, well, that's important, considering

565
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
that, you know, our account's been breached and we need to change their passwords.

566
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Well, you're not going to have a choice.

567
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,800
They're going to make you change your password when you come back on, that's a big, big part

568
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
of it.

569
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,320
Not only that, you have to do it from the original PS3.

570
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,760
Or an email thing, because, you know, some people have changed their PlayStation 3s.

571
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:20,880
PlayStation Home, oh goody, Friends List and chat functionality are coming back.

572
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
So yeah.

573
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,840
And then some other fun stuff, of course, they're also going to be, as their Welcome

574
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:38,200
Back program, they're going to be offering some free stuff for you, because they're sorry.

575
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,480
So the free stuff that they're going to be offering, a free download with, I believe

576
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,160
they were saying that was worth $20, maybe?

577
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,820
And then 30 days free of PlayStation Plus, I'm rolling my eyes.

578
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:04,400
And Curiosity, I guess a free membership to Curiosity or something like that.

579
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,760
Yes, 30 days of Curiosity.

580
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,340
Yeah, I like how those last two bits, oh yeah, we're just going to give you a trial to those

581
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,480
so that maybe you might buy them after, you know, the trial's up.

582
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
And a download.

583
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,240
You know, even though all your personal information's been stolen, one download should make you

584
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,880
forget all about that, right?

585
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Eh?

586
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
No?

587
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Maybe?

588
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,920
They didn't really say, yeah, the download price.

589
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Kazurai was saying that, I guess, a few thousand yen worth of free downloads, so like $20 or

590
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
$25.

591
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,440
And yeah, that's interesting.

592
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,440
And then, of course, there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 firmware company with the

593
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,320
relaunch of the PlayStation Network, and they're saying that the network is physically being

594
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,520
rebuilt, because apparently it was just inferior as it was.

595
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,320
You know, it might help that if they didn't store these same, on the same servers, your

596
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,720
credit card information and all that stuff with these servers that actually sell product,

597
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,120
you know, they might want to keep that stuff separate in case one gets hacked, or the store

598
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,880
gets hacked, which is more likely.

599
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,360
So they're going to be doing that.

600
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,380
And they said, and of course, you know, I love it, to make them sound like they're really

601
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
on top of it.

602
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,960
Well, it's something we were planning on doing anyway, so we're just going to do it quicker

603
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,800
now.

604
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,080
We were on top of this.

605
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Great.

606
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,080
I'm glad you were on top of it, so you knew that this was going to be a problem.

607
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,720
You just admitted to that.

608
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
And then, of course, you know, this is a real big deal, since, you know, about, they're

609
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,520
saying 70 million users worth of data have been leaked out, including credit card information.

610
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:58,520
So of course, Congress and Homeland Security are now forming task forces or, you know,

611
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,460
sending inquiries about what's going on.

612
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,120
So I guess Homeland Security and the FBI are going to be helping them out, you know, investigating

613
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,480
the data breach and all that stuff.

614
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,260
So I guess that's supposed to make us feel good.

615
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
So great.

616
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,240
Our tax money's going to this.

617
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,680
Well, I mean, it is only, like, I think the most major breach that's ever happened on

618
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,440
the internet type of thing, but, um, can I go off now?

619
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,520
Well, hold on.

620
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,720
There was a rumor that they were seeing it, um, the PlayStation, it was hacked through

621
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,880
a PlayStation 3, basically, you know, getting access to the store through custom firmware

622
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,160
or something like that, or some development side or something.

623
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I don't know.

624
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
What if they staged this whole thing?

625
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
No.

626
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,960
The whole thing is, well, here's what it was, and it was really terrible, because all they

627
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,700
were doing the entire time was their, oh, those hackers, those hackers got in.

628
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,280
Yet there was never, oh, well, we're stupid, and we, you know, we didn't, you know, first

629
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,680
off, we didn't encrypt any of our personal data.

630
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Haha!

631
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Haha!

632
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
That's funny, you know?

633
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,000
We'll laugh about that later on.

634
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,020
And then second, you know, their servers were the same servers for, you know, all that stuff.

635
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
It's ridiculous.

636
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Okay.

637
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:19,800
Um, I'm not going to be a satisfied PlayStation because I, you, you can throw all this free

638
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,320
shit at me, although I don't think, honestly, and this is one of the pro Sony things I'm

639
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,440
going to say, because I, I don't consider myself a Sony fanboy or an Xbox fanboy or

640
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
any of it.

641
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,800
I, I, I chew out everyone equally, because I love gaming, and these companies screw things

642
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,680
up and it's usually at a management level.

643
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,040
It makes me angry.

644
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,720
Um, and what makes me, the, the free stuff here, I don't think actually Sony really owes

645
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,400
you anything for free, because the network was free in the first place.

646
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,760
And, you know, if your credit card gets hacked, you don't ask the bank for free money.

647
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,120
I mean, you have a protection with your bank that the bank will, you know, look, if you

648
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,320
have a fraudulent charge, you're protected against that.

649
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,780
If you have any type of decent credit card or bank, you're protected against fraud and

650
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
all that stuff.

651
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,660
But there's still some onus on you to monitor your statements and monitor everything that's

652
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
going on.

653
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,400
But I think what they're really, it's not even necessarily, people think that they're

654
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,840
owed something for the network being down for a few days.

655
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,960
I think they're saying that they're owed something for the hassle of having to go through and

656
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,360
change all that information, get new credit cards and that kind of stuff.

657
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,060
Well, and yeah, I, I can understand that, but at the same time, if you weren't monitoring

658
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,560
your stuff before, you're an idiot, like, sorry, but this should have been a severe

659
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,640
wake up call to you if you haven't been monitoring your stuff before, because you could get your

660
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,860
stuff stolen from a gas pump from one of those readers.

661
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,200
You could get your stuff stolen from any clerk or any waiter at a restaurant that you give

662
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
your cards to.

663
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,920
You know, your card number gets out there exposed all the time.

664
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,120
You have to monitor that stuff and if this didn't serve as a wake up call to you, I don't

665
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
know what to tell you.

666
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,240
Well, honestly, the best way around any real risk is use cash.

667
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,520
Well, I suppose there's that too, but I don't want to be, I don't want to be tinfoil hat

668
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
either.

669
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,660
You know, my agreement with the bank, I'm fucking paying visa, right?

670
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,160
Because they get, there's either the interest that they're making off the credit card to

671
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,560
begin with, or in the case of debit cards, they take a percentage of the sale and so

672
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
forth.

673
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,680
These companies are paid to prevent fraud.

674
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,080
My problem here is I need to hear more about how Sony is going to prevent this from happening

675
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
again.

676
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,480
I understand they're hiring a privacy officer, which is fine.

677
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,120
I understand that they're moving their data center, whether it was planned already or

678
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,680
not, whatever, at least they're finally understanding, whoops, we fucked up.

679
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,360
And it's kind of one of those fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

680
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,920
Because if they put the damn thing back up and then they just get hacked again, they're

681
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,240
going to be, they're going to be dead as a company, period.

682
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,480
It's just like when Jack in the Box, uh, killed the people with Ecoli, a couple, it was probably

683
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,180
about 15 years ago.

684
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,240
Right after that happened, they were the safest restaurant to eat at because you knew if they

685
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,580
were going to mess up again, they would be out of business, every single one of them.

686
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,320
And they've been able to recover from what was an unfortunate mess now, obviously very

687
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,040
different scenarios because you're talking lives are not at stake in this scenario, what's

688
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,360
going on with Sony.

689
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,460
However, there still is certainly, you know, a big passion, big, big headline news thing

690
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,120
going on here.

691
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:25,400
So, um, there's some other things to consider though, is that what Sony got is that, uh,

692
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,200
Sony needs to kind of ask themselves, you know, how are we going to prevent the hacking

693
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
happening in the future?

694
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
I'm not condoning the hacking at all.

695
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
And you know, I, cause I see some stuff going on in the chat, but I want to make it clear.

696
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,160
The ultimate problem is not with Sony, it's with the hackers and whoever went into the

697
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,260
system in the first place, they are the problem.

698
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,460
And let's be real, if they try to use that credit card data that was stolen at this,

699
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,240
this point, they're going to have the FBI up their ass.

700
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,020
If you're a hacker that did this, or you're somebody that buys this data from the hackers,

701
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,100
you are an absolute moron who's just begging to go to jail because you're going to have

702
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,060
every state agency so far up your butt.

703
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,160
I mean, let's be real.

704
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,420
So if you do have that data, you really shouldn't use it.

705
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,420
Let's be fair.

706
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Okay.

707
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,380
Now, uh, and so I certainly don't condone that.

708
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,820
That's, you know, hacking to that level where you are stealing information, whatever.

709
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,140
And if they, if they are trying to sell it for a profit, as some folks are saying, it's

710
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,500
up on forums and so forth, but you know, what's real and what's trolling.

711
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
We don't know.

712
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
You know, where's the line drawn.

713
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,540
So I don't condone the hacking.

714
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,900
However, you can't help but feel like Sony kind of opened themselves up to it a little

715
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
bit.

716
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Throwing this out.

717
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Sony did.

718
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,820
Didn't Sony kind of come out in the school yard and kind of wave their hands saying,

719
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,280
come at us.

720
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,660
How many times do they get up there on the stage at E3 and say, our system is unhackable.

721
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,300
Wait, wait, wait.

722
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Just throwing this out there.

723
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,140
And I'm not sure on the accuracy of the rumor, but let's just pretend that it's real here

724
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:02,820
because it would fall in line with the lack of dedication to safety, I guess, or of our

725
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
information.

726
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:10,700
Apparently, the rumor is that that credit card list was encrypted with the same keys

727
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,100
that they use for the PlayStation 3.

728
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,700
Oops.

729
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,460
So the point is, and what I really want to get at here, and this is how Sony can really

730
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,140
earn back my trust, stop being so fucking hard headed.

731
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,380
It is time to admit your vulnerability.

732
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,140
And this press conference yesterday didn't cut it.

733
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,620
It didn't cut it because essentially they came out there and they just, you know, they're

734
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,380
trying to point fingers at everybody else except themselves.

735
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,740
And honestly, what really needs to happen is management needs to be shaken up.

736
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,100
Kazurai needs to come down.

737
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,380
Sorry.

738
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,300
That's what is really going to make me happy is for PlayStation to change their management.

739
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
However, unfortunately, I don't see that happening.

740
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,380
Well, what's I think also going to restore a lot of faith that customers might have in

741
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,820
them is for them to display that level of accountability.

742
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,780
Accountability for me, especially as a big thing with a company.

743
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,940
And if I'm seeing none of that, then I'm not going to give them my business.

744
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,620
I mean, that's why I pretty much decided I don't think I'm going to get anything else

745
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
for PS3.

746
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,140
At the end of the day, I think Sony can win me back.

747
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,900
I mean, it's not like corporations don't do dumb things once in a while.

748
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,220
And excuse me, Xbox fanboys, excuse me.

749
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,020
The Red Ring of Death thing was atrocious and was horrible on Microsoft's part.

750
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,100
But they've come a long way since then, to be fair.

751
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
And they handled it well.

752
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,700
They finally did extend their warranty and they admitted their problem.

753
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,620
That's what I need Sony to do here.

754
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Yeah.

755
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:47,460
But I don't, until they have some accountability, I don't think I'm going to give them my business.

756
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,620
I mean, but it's a hard situation because, you know, I can see how some of you are thinking,

757
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,420
well, Rob, is that saying what the hackers did is okay?

758
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,500
No, that's not what I'm saying.

759
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,860
What the hackers did is not okay.

760
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,100
But you know what I've said on the show before, hackers going to hack.

761
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,380
And you know, this news we've seen, this stuff about Sony and so forth, they really have

762
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,400
just been inviting it.

763
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,980
This whole thing about, we want to subpoena everybody's PlayStation 3 that ever accessed

764
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,780
a website even remotely related to this GeoHots thing.

765
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,700
When he admitted he wasn't even after coming after data in the first place, he just wanted

766
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,980
to get the other OS thing back or whatever.

767
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
I mean, let's be real.

768
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,500
This all traces back to Sony taking off the other OS feature.

769
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Yeah.

770
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,660
If Sony had never done that, this would have never happened.

771
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Yeah.

772
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,860
But hindsight, you know.

773
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
Right.

774
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,780
But maybe it needed to happen.

775
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,580
Maybe we were all getting a little too comfortable with this whole digital distribution thing.

776
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,940
Maybe this, you know, and I've said this before on the show and I still mean it.

777
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,260
This is going to set digital distribution back a little bit because this goes beyond

778
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
Sony.

779
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:56,660
This is going to affect that horrific copyright protection thing that Capcom has.

780
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,960
If you bought a game like Bionic Commander or whatever, you haven't been able to play

781
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,740
it for the past 11 days on PlayStation 3.

782
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,380
And we're having class action lawsuits against only Sony.

783
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
I'm sorry.

784
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
Someone needs to file one against Capcom.

785
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Yeah.

786
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,380
Sorry.

787
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,740
I can't play a game I bought.

788
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,940
That's your problem, that's kind of your problem.

789
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,340
You know, that's what I like to see happen.

790
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,340
No, I agree.

791
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,580
Alright, I'm going to chatroom.

792
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,580
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

793
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,460
Derek H. in our chatroom says, I would like a press release saying they've hired a hit

794
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,820
team to track down and assassinate the hackers.

795
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,220
You know, it's interesting, I did feel like at that press conference day they were really

796
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,580
trying to finger point at Anonymous.

797
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,940
They don't even know who did it.

798
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,260
And I know they keep saying, well, it could be Anonymous, but you know, they said they

799
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,780
didn't do it, but you know, there's no head to Anonymous, so it could have been another

800
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,980
cell of Anonymous.

801
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,140
Yeah, but the whole thing was, I think, is people used Anonymous because there was that

802
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,940
whole conflict going.

803
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:52,080
So whoever it was that was planning on doing this probably said, oh, now seems like a good

804
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,180
time because they're going to be looking at them.

805
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,460
Or be distracted by them.

806
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,940
And so that's when they went and did it.

807
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:04,620
And if it was actually what they, the rumor is, where that it was part of this Rebug firmware

808
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:10,940
that was out there that gave you basically developer access that you could actually download

809
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,300
content for free and stuff.

810
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,020
That was one of the rumors I heard that they, one of the reasons that they took the store

811
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:25,100
down because someone found a way to basically steal PlayStation Network stuff.

812
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,900
But then again, you know, I don't know, they're not really being forthcoming with everything

813
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
that happened.

814
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,060
Even during their press conference, they're like, well, we can't confirm that anybody's

815
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,540
actually touched the credit card data that was even compromised.

816
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,220
So you know, they're kind of going back on saying, oh, well, you know, the credit card

817
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,580
stuff's not compromised, but here's all this stuff that you need to do to make sure that

818
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,700
your credit card's okay.

819
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,500
You know, it's like, oh, well, that doesn't sound very sure of yourself now.

820
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,220
That's a CYA move.

821
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,660
Rama says, and also I guarantee that a few people may have lost their jobs over this.

822
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,220
You know, and it's always unfortunate for job loss.

823
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,500
I just hope the right people lost their jobs over this because if it was the people down

824
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,880
in the trenches, that's not who needs to be losing their jobs over it.

825
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,580
And you know, I don't want to just go off speculation either.

826
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,940
If Sony shook up their management, I want to see the receipts.

827
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,180
Going to the chat room with some more comments here.

828
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,460
Rama says, Sky, yes, Microsoft got a black eye for the red ring of death, but Microsoft

829
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,540
stepped up to the plates and handled it.

830
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,620
When people bitched at Nintendo about the Wiimotes, they stepped up.

831
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,860
Now that people are bitching to Sony, they turn a blind eye and say, that's not, there's

832
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
not a problem.

833
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,020
Jedi mind trick my ass.

834
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,220
Absolutely right.

835
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,780
That's my whole point.

836
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,260
And that I don't think that press conference yesterday cut it.

837
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,020
And I really don't know what is to blame except the management at Sony.

838
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,060
It's being a poorly managed company right now.

839
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,420
That's that.

840
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:02,180
Let's see, also, some other folks in chat, Defective Candy saying, gah, it wasn't Anon.

841
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,540
Bangs her head against the desk.

842
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,940
Well, I mean, the only problem Anon has is that because it is the way it is, and I'm

843
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,620
not knocking Anon, like, you know, whatever, it's just a subculture of the internet.

844
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:19,360
But the problem with Anon is because it has no face, it's really easy to point the finger

845
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
at them.

846
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,540
It's really easy for Kasarai to get up there and say, well, Anon was in our systems and

847
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,820
Anon did this hacking and, you know, we're sending the FBI and the top people on this.

848
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,420
We're going to make an example out of some of those Anon kids.

849
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,220
Very easy to blame them.

850
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,620
Well, good luck.

851
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,020
You know, they have yet to find any of these people anyways.

852
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,700
And you know, how are they going to prove who did it?

853
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
I mean, that's tough.

854
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,500
That's the best thing about it.

855
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,540
That's the smartest thing any type of vigilante group can do on top of that is to be completely

856
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
decentralized.

857
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,540
You know, not know who the other parties are.

858
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,020
Dungeon Buster in Artarum says, I don't think that's necessarily related to anything about

859
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,340
GeoHots or Anonymous.

860
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,140
Sony has a lot of other enemies.

861
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,780
Perhaps everything else that was going on with the other companies showed the real person

862
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,620
who hacked all this how easy it was to do.

863
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,260
Maybe, I still think though, a lot of what happened leading up to this helped whoever

864
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,300
did it.

865
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,520
We've got an email coming up that's got a pretty interesting suggestion.

866
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,660
So I'm going to...

867
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,660
Alright.

868
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,660
Here's my suggestion though, is all this free stuff you're throwing my way, like free download

869
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:33,580
and free PlayStation Plus and free Curiosity, I don't care about two thirds of that.

870
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,940
And the download, I might not even care about that either.

871
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:44,300
So I mean, that's like saying, imagine if you will, Rob, that you went to a restaurant,

872
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,180
nice restaurant or whatever, or not even necessarily a nice restaurant.

873
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,620
Say you went to Jack in the Box, we'll use Jack in the Box again, and you went there

874
00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:02,620
and you bought something and someone stole your credit card information, stole your identity,

875
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:07,140
and you found out, you went to the management and they're like, here's a voucher for a free

876
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,220
jumbo jack, sorry.

877
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,920
Would that cut it with you?

878
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,780
I would be kind of like, really?

879
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,820
This is what you're giving me?

880
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,060
Here's the thing though, I'm not fully convinced that only Sony is vulnerable to a hack like

881
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,060
this.

882
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,100
And we've heard of other personal data being compromised on other websites and so forth.

883
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:42,540
So I'm not sure I fully believe that my information is 100% secure with Microsoft, with one of

884
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,260
their only services, Steam, with Blizzard.

885
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,100
I don't know, but I'm not going to freak out about it.

886
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,380
I'm not going to panic and I'm not going to cancel all my credit cards and all that stuff

887
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:59,260
because the money I pay to have a debit or credit card in the first place is supposed

888
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,580
to pay to protect me from the fraud.

889
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,300
So I'm not that worried about it.

890
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,000
And I can thank the PlayStation for being so useless to me that the last time I used

891
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,500
my credit card, it had expired that same month, so hahaha!

892
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,660
You have old credit card information, good luck spending that money.

893
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,140
Dan was saying right before the show though, the one time he finally decided to buy something

894
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,620
on PlayStation Network, that was when Moondiver came out, because it's done by the dude that

895
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,720
did Strider.

896
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,420
Then all this goes down and he's like, well shit.

897
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,180
But I mean, other than that, we never really used PlayStation Network, I had zero interest

898
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,180
in it.

899
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,060
I didn't make a profile until we had our system for two years.

900
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,980
If that's any indication, when I was playing Final Fantasy 13.

901
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,780
Let me go back to this too in our chatroom, because this is a good point and it came up

902
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,860
on my Twitter earlier, but it hasn't come up yet on the show here tonight.

903
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,360
Tiger Kong in our chatroom says, you don't have to worry about Nintendo getting hacked,

904
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,740
they don't hold any personal info other than friend codes.

905
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,140
Well now, despite the shit we've given Nintendo over the years about being so fucking far

906
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,100
beyond the times, behind the times when it comes to online stuff, right now, their way

907
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,860
of handling credit card payments looks pretty fucking good.

908
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,860
In light of all this.

909
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,140
I would rather have security than convenience.

910
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,420
Just so you know, the Nintendo Wii makes you put in your complete credit card info every

911
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,420
time.

912
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
It doesn't save it.

913
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,140
And sometimes it can get a little frustrating, it's like, here I am, putting it in again

914
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
on the Wiimote.

915
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,980
But right now, that system looks pretty darn good.

916
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,380
No it doesn't, because, I'm sorry.

917
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,380
Once again.

918
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,380
Not that I'd actually buy anything on virtual console right now.

919
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,380
I don't care, you know, let's praise Nintendo for being lazy.

920
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,380
I'm sorry.

921
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,220
I'm not saying praise them.

922
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,760
I'm just saying, it's ironic how this all kind of works out where Nintendo has really

923
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,340
nothing to lose with what happened here.

924
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,380
Because of the fact they're so far behind the times.

925
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,020
So my only point is that maybe we were moving ahead too fast.

926
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,220
We weren't moving ahead too fast, it was just they had poor security, that's all.

927
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,020
They thought that, oh, we're big bad Sony, we're just perfect, we're never gonna get

928
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,160
hacked.

929
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,140
And that was the wrong, first off, that's the wrong thing to go touting.

930
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,500
That'd be like saying, hey, good luck trying to break into my house and steal my stuff.

931
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,660
I mean, come on, you're just, you're...

932
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,960
People are motivated by spite.

933
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,260
You know, if you're trying to, people like being competitive.

934
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,100
And people like, you know, challenging things that you're giving them, especially a company.

935
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,740
They like looking at the company as the evil corporate giant.

936
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:38,100
And if you go and say, well, good luck doing that, rrrr, people are gonna take the David

937
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,740
and Goliath route and they're gonna try to bring Goliath down.

938
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:47,660
And you know, for every hundred people that try and fail, someone's gonna do it.

939
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,300
So you know how you avoid that?

940
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:55,340
You don't go saying, try to hack me.

941
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,020
Being in the chat room at chat.orangehonestrader.com, there's lots of interesting stuff going on

942
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,140
in the chat room right now.

943
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,980
Let's see, Spaznator in our chat room says, I really didn't expect any freebies.

944
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,680
All I'd like is an I'm sorry and assurance that they're learning from their mistakes.

945
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,680
Thank you.

946
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,620
That would be great, actually.

947
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,660
Derek H in our chat says, Sky, that's like saying a horse and carriage looks good after

948
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,300
you get into a car accident.

949
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,460
You know, it's really funny that you use that as an example because my mom has a true diagnosed

950
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,820
fear of driving cars and vehicles and all that.

951
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,420
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that, you know, she just didn't like them, whatever,

952
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,780
growing up or what have you.

953
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,360
And the one time she decided to buck her fear and get behind the wheel of the car after

954
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,460
going through the process, getting a license, all that stuff, you know, she finally decides

955
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,140
to drive on the freeway for the first time in 20 years.

956
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,140
She got sideswiped by a truck.

957
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,420
It wasn't even her fault, by the way.

958
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,420
It was somebody else.

959
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,280
And so now she refuses to drive on the freeway ever and she will only drive the car herself.

960
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,820
Like if it's like a do or die scenario.

961
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,820
So actually, horse and carriage rides can be very romantic.

962
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,580
Well, I actually will say this.

963
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:04,340
I do prefer Nintendo's method of not storing the information because whenever I pay, the

964
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:10,900
only I think online thing ever that has my information saved is my PayPal, which I used

965
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:16,180
to pay for any online service now because I can stop my information from PayPal and

966
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:22,540
the site won't have my information or my WoW subscription.

967
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,820
But other than that, nowhere else has my information.

968
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,040
Black Wolf in our chat room says, you know, the Battlestar Galactica wasn't affected by

969
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,380
the Cylon attack because it didn't use as much future technology as the other Battlestars.

970
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,380
Excellent point, Bobby.

971
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,900
At least somebody who's on the same wavelength as me.

972
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,220
All right.

973
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,680
I, yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.

974
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,060
You know, that hasn't already been said.

975
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,780
I just, where's the, I'm sorry.

976
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,380
We'll see what happens.

977
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,380
Moving on.

978
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,620
I do have another story that's kind of in the same vein as a lot of this stuff, if you

979
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,820
will.

980
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,980
And what did I say was the root cause of all of this?

981
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,220
Sony removing the other OAS feature in the past.

982
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,960
And interesting enough, Sony's troubles may not be over as far as that's concerned.

983
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,860
They've actually lost what could be a landmark decision in this whole thing.

984
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,940
Now here's the deal.

985
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:18,780
It's not as major as it might seem, but it happened in Finland.

986
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,100
And it happened by what's called a consumer's board.

987
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,620
It is a ruling, but it's a consumer's board.

988
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:29,240
It's not necessarily a government legitimate courtroom ruling, but the consumer's board

989
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,860
in Finland has decided that this man who actually took Sony to court, oh, they were removing

990
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:40,260
the other OAS feature, that Sony needs to cough up a hundred euros for doing it.

991
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,100
That he should get that because he lost the Linux ability after updating to play a newer

992
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,060
game that he bought for the system.

993
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,220
Here's a quote from the original article, which is floating around.

994
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,980
I'm looking at this off a web forum, so I apologize.

995
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,040
I don't know where this came from originally.

996
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,420
The man at the center of the case in Finland, which was brought to the consumer complaints

997
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,820
board, lost the ability to use an alternative operating system after an update was installed

998
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,900
from a new game.

999
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,180
He was seeking 150 euros in damages for the removal of the other OAS feature.

1000
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,980
The CCB said that the removal of other OAS crippled console features that were present

1001
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,940
at the time of purchase and agreed that consumers should be compensated.

1002
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,880
It recommended that the manufacturer and seller of the console pay a hundred euros jointly

1003
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,520
to compensate the man.

1004
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,280
The CCB does not have the power to enforce the ruling, but the opinion of this board

1005
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,460
in Finland is considered by the courts in a dispute, meaning if it does go to court,

1006
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,560
this will weigh heavily on what happens.

1007
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,820
So, interesting.

1008
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,180
I guess if Sony truly thought their system, I mean, well this also kind of goes back to

1009
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,780
Sony being hard-headed.

1010
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,900
Sony put the other OAS feature in there because they were convinced it could not be used to

1011
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,380
hack their system because it was unhackable.

1012
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,980
The minute they found it, oh, it was hackable, oh, they removed it.

1013
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,020
Well, maybe you shouldn't have put it there in the first place!

1014
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,900
And still though, it's like saying, you know, oh, well this feature, no one's really using

1015
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,220
this feature.

1016
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,820
Okay, it's a feature on something and you remove it.

1017
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,260
People are going to be pissed because it is, somebody is obviously using it.

1018
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,060
If no one was using it, why'd you put it there in the first place?

1019
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,900
I mean, that's like saying, oh, Spanish language?

1020
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,860
No one uses a Spanish language.

1021
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:22,860
I can just speak English or French.

1022
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,860
So there you go.

1023
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,540
It'll be interesting to see what develops of that.

1024
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,500
Sony's troubles may not be over.

1025
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,940
We're going to be talking about the legal team moving from whatever was going on with

1026
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,700
Geohotz to now having to deal with class action lawsuits over the downtime.

1027
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:41,540
This whole other OS lawsuit and there's a whole other nightmare of problems.

1028
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,100
I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing in the background right now.

1029
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,100
That's all I hear.

1030
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,100
Yeah.

1031
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,740
Anyhow, Dark Soccer, don't you have something, just something to take my mind off.

1032
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,980
How about some good news?

1033
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,980
How about it?

1034
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,380
How about something for Portal 2?

1035
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,660
There's going to be a new download content this summer.

1036
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:01,580
Valve put out an announcement and it's free, which is great.

1037
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:07,260
It'll be called DLC number one and it will have new test chambers, leaderboards, challenge

1038
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,420
mode for single and multiplayer, quote and more, end quote.

1039
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:18,660
It will be on all platforms, Mac, PC, Xbox 360, and maybe PlayStation three, maybe?

1040
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,940
And uh, it'll be on, yeah, it'll be on PS3.

1041
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,500
I'm just making a poke, but hey, that's pretty cool.

1042
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,420
And I so much love the game already that it'd be kind of neat to have some new stuff to

1043
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,420
do.

1044
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:36,620
You gotta admit though, every developer, every single one of them who makes money off DLC,

1045
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:41,140
who makes money off designing games specifically for the Xbox live arcade and PlayStation network

1046
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,820
platforms has got to be looking at what's going on right now, 11 days of lost sales.

1047
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,820
This is free.

1048
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,620
I know this is free, but I just, it just reminds me of that whole thing and that's why I'm

1049
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,340
saying the impact on the whole digital distribution thing will be felt.

1050
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,900
Anyhow, I like free things though.

1051
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,900
I hope part, I hope we do get more maps and things that let this game live on.

1052
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,900
It'd be great.

1053
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,540
And I think it's a good value as it is, but just if they enhance that value, especially

1054
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,860
if they have like a map editor for people, Oh my gosh.

1055
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,060
I think that's one of the things I was hearing about going to be coming out actually is that

1056
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,260
they're because that was always been kind of cool though.

1057
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,220
Like, you know what Gary's mod is, right?

1058
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,400
You know, the modding community is really big out there and they've, you know, paid,

1059
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,580
you know, to put some development into some of this.

1060
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:28,500
So they're seeing people doing the same thing with portal and are encouraging it.

1061
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,620
And I think they're supposed to have, I remembered hearing something about them having some sort

1062
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,100
of level sharing coming out.

1063
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,980
There was some fan wank discussion last night.

1064
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,360
I want to say it was one when I was on wow about talking about how awesome it would be

1065
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,100
if like there was a Tron themed portal level or something like that.

1066
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,680
And I'm like, that fan wank could be a reality if they do release some of these like map

1067
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,300
editors and things, somebody will be on that.

1068
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,300
You know it.

1069
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,900
It's ironic, but the orange and blue would fit very well with the Tron universe.

1070
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,900
Wouldn't it?

1071
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:00,500
So yeah, and considering, yeah, actually it would.

1072
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:05,980
Can you imagine like a death match portal type thing or like four player portal or something

1073
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,660
that we just death match portal?

1074
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,660
I don't know.

1075
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,780
I, I don't know.

1076
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:16,300
There's I, there's part of me that wants to say no, they should think about the more competitive

1077
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,160
stuff when portal three comes out and there's a part of me that says actually portal three

1078
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,080
should probably never come out.

1079
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,460
I don't think there should be a portal three.

1080
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,300
You know, maybe it's like one of those movies that really doesn't need a sequel.

1081
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,580
I don't see at all possible how there could be a portal three where there's money to be

1082
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,580
made.

1083
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,540
There's always, they're saying though that for, um, half life three that what's your

1084
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,740
face tell is supposed to be in half life three.

1085
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,740
Yeah.

1086
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:49,220
Speaking of like valve and things that end in three, I'm not so sure that's a possibility

1087
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,740
with house actually.

1088
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:59,460
Have they ever gotten to three in their series three episode three is supposed to be episode

1089
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
three is a myth.

1090
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,460
Okay.

1091
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,460
Yeah.

1092
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
Let's see.

1093
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,460
Left for dead.

1094
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,460
Well, the first two came out real quick.

1095
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,460
Then there was never a third one portal.

1096
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,460
Well, we'll see.

1097
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,940
And yeah, no, I don't know.

1098
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,420
Did they ever get to three?

1099
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,940
I'm not saying this necessarily a bad thing.

1100
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,100
I'm just, you know, well, let's put it this way.

1101
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:20,380
We haven't heard of any new games from valve yet and I can imagine that there's a certain

1102
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,500
E3 convention around the corner.

1103
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:28,980
So I'm sure with, you know, nothing really on the slate from valve, there's lots to possibly

1104
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,980
announce.

1105
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Yeah.

1106
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,580
This could finally be where they do drop the bombshell about half life episode three, but

1107
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,580
I don't know.

1108
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,700
Or left for dead threes with a portal gun in there.

1109
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,220
Or maybe something new.

1110
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,340
I mean, I kind of trust valve with new ideas right now.

1111
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,280
You know, they've had a lot of good stuff.

1112
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,540
Like left for dead, great game, often copied portal.

1113
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
Excellent little thing.

1114
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,380
I mean, I'm, I'm all for whatever they come out with next.

1115
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,940
I believe one of the things they have on the horizon is their whole, uh, defense of the

1116
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,940
ancients.

1117
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
Dota.

1118
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
He's called Dota two.

1119
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,940
Yeah.

1120
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:06,660
They have an official Dota thing coming out, which was originally a Warcraft three mod,

1121
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,260
but they hired the people that made it.

1122
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,100
It's not the same thing as league of legends.

1123
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,540
In fact, legal legends is kind of, it's this whole, the defense of the ancients thing has

1124
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,080
gone a million different ways because blizzard has their own thing coming to starcraft legal

1125
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,220
legends is out there too, by, I believe some of the people that were involved with Dota

1126
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,220
in the beginning.

1127
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,420
And then the people that got hired from valve for Dota have the official Dota two game

1128
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,420
coming out.

1129
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,260
And I think that's probably what you're going to see.

1130
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,860
Most of it E3 this year out of valve, anyhow, free stuff.

1131
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,860
Yeah.

1132
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,860
Free stuff is good.

1133
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,660
And I'm all for continuing to expand the terrific game that is portal two, but I would honestly

1134
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,700
be still be happy with my purchase if they never expanded it.

1135
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,740
But I think I'm still having fun.

1136
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1137
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,180
I just think it's a great value.

1138
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,540
Anyhow, Loki, let's move on.

1139
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,100
Ah, yes.

1140
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:59,700
And the, the other big story that was floating around the web of course is the off rumored

1141
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:03,220
a sequel console for the, we obviously, I mean, there's going to be a new console from

1142
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,820
Nintendo at some point.

1143
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:10,180
Um, now Nintendo has officially announced that yes, they will be talking about a successor

1144
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:16,460
to the Wii, not necessarily a Wii two, but a, another console coming, um, for 2012.

1145
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:22,220
And of course, um, you know, they're saying, uh, you know, it's going to be shown off at

1146
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,220
E3.

1147
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:28,580
It's going to be playable E3, um, probably if you're pressing behind doors, but you know,

1148
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,900
it will be playable.

1149
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,900
It'll be there.

1150
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,660
Thing that has the Uber long line to play.

1151
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,660
Yes.

1152
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:39,900
That's been Nintendo's E3 motif for years, uh, minus the airport, of course, tons of

1153
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,060
rumors about what it is and project cafe and all that fun stuff.

1154
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,700
And just so you know, last week we talked at length about this cause a lot of the rumors

1155
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,700
had come out.

1156
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,620
Now we have the confirmation Nintendo saying, okay, yes, it's happening and we'll see you

1157
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,620
at E3.

1158
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,420
That's, that's the news from this week.

1159
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,260
Last week we talked at length about a lot of stuff, just so you know, which by the way

1160
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:05,220
would include when I in January on this program said, Nintendo is showing a new console at

1161
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,060
E3 this year because they've got nothing going for them on the Wii right now, but that new

1162
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:13,820
Zelda game and you, Loki, said, no, no, they're not going to show, no, the Wii still prints

1163
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,820
money.

1164
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,300
They're not going to show a new console at E3.

1165
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,900
So I just wanted to say, thank you.

1166
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,900
Okay.

1167
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,780
Um, but you're still wrong with them not having anything coming out on the Wii.

1168
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,420
What's going to come out on the Wii?

1169
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,420
Let's see.

1170
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,100
They've already got two games that they have coming out in June.

1171
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:35,900
Wii Play Motion and Mystery Case Files, which was previously Dust Dust.

1172
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,540
And then they also have their Zelda game coming out, which yes, I can probably see them doing

1173
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,660
another Twilight Princess, oh, it's meant for the Wii, but we're going to port it over

1174
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,100
to the new system because, uh, well actually, you know what, I don't know if they would

1175
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:52,020
do that because if it's coming out at the end of 2012, then I don't think that they

1176
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,020
would delay it that long.

1177
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,020
They need something for Christmas this year.

1178
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:59,360
If the system isn't coming out until 2012, uh, you know, and to be fair, I had speculated

1179
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,020
like why are they waiting until 2012?

1180
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,040
But I guess they did the same thing with the 3DS.

1181
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,300
They do need something this year.

1182
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:11,260
And I actually think you calling the new Super Mario Brothers sequel, I think is a distinct

1183
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:15,220
possibility for the rabbit out of their hat for the Wii this year.

1184
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,860
Let's, yeah, I know you guys talked about this last week, but I wasn't here, so I'm

1185
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,140
just going to get my take on a lot of stuff.

1186
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:23,940
And you love Nintendo more than anyone on this show, so definitely want to know your

1187
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,940
opinion.

1188
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,500
Listen, okay, we've got to think like Nintendo here and why they're doing what they're doing.

1189
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,220
Here's how it's going to all work, I think.

1190
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,860
Okay, let's take the name Project Cafe.

1191
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,860
What is a cafe?

1192
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,700
A cafe is a place that you go gather with your friends.

1193
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:45,020
It's a very casual meeting place, lots of, you know, chatting and interactivity and that

1194
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,020
kind of stuff.

1195
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:51,820
So maybe now the focus is going to be, and you know, that'd be great if they actually

1196
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:58,140
did more like online kind of think of like Facebook stuff, you know, where you're sharing

1197
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,620
stuff with your friends, you're, you know, conversing.

1198
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:08,420
It's very casual, I don't know, lots of online content, we'd hope.

1199
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:14,180
Sorry, I have to say S2100 Matt in the chatroom says, Rob, the Christmas hot seller is the

1200
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,500
Vitality sensor.

1201
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:21,220
I guarantee you the Vitality sensor is dead, it's been swept under the rug.

1202
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:26,540
However, you may see it rear its little ugly head on whatever, like, you know, just a little

1203
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,660
piece of metal on the back of some controller.

1204
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,820
Nintendo will never fully scrap an idea.

1205
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,780
It will rear its ugly head again at some point, but as far as the Wii Vitality sensor, no.

1206
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,300
It got laughed out of submission.

1207
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:44,820
Alright, so anyways, so you may see something like that, but this is Nintendo we're talking

1208
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,980
about here, so I don't know if they're actually going to do that.

1209
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:53,460
I would hope that, you know, now being that this is the next generation of consoles, they

1210
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:59,100
would understand that yes, okay, online gaming is something that people do want, you know,

1211
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:05,820
social, you know, community features, something that people do like having, because Facebook

1212
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,780
is popular, all this stuff's popular, let's bring it in, okay, so let's assume that they're

1213
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,780
going to do that.

1214
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,620
Oh God, that's why the controllers are all touch screens, because they're going to want

1215
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,780
you to take them out in public, just like the 3DS, they're going to want you to take

1216
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:22,460
those things with you wherever you go, so that when you meet people, you can, like,

1217
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,900
do the game data trades, just like the 3DS.

1218
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,540
No, I don't think they're going to be doing that.

1219
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,540
Really?

1220
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,900
And here's, here's, okay, first off, they're not going to have a controller like, well,

1221
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:37,940
they're going to have, they may have a controller with a six, I have a hard time believing that

1222
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,540
there's going to be a six-inch touch screen on a controller, because that's going to be

1223
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,980
fucking expensive.

1224
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,620
Just so you know the kind of level where I speculated last week, I said if it's true,

1225
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:49,180
if it's even true, because, you know, all the people kind of come out of the woodwork

1226
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,620
about, you know, these speculations and so forth, if it's true, you know, at one point

1227
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:57,220
the Wii was supposed to project 3D imagery on the wall, remember that, but here's the

1228
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:00,860
thing, if it's true about these touch screens, I think it's like a, like the printers, like,

1229
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,340
you know how there's a lot of $300 printers out there where you can take the screen off

1230
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,620
and, like, digitally manipulate your photos on the screen and then print them from that,

1231
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,620
and they're kind of like a low-quality screen, but they are full-color and they look alright?

1232
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,540
I think it's that, but, like, a fucking iPad is a controller?

1233
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,540
No.

1234
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,260
No, it's, it's not anything like that.

1235
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:21,700
If anything, I would see maybe it's some sort, because you have to also understand, Nintendo's

1236
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,280
not going to compete with themselves.

1237
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,140
Why would they release something that could be used as, like, a portable gaming device

1238
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,980
when they have a portable gaming device that doesn't make any sense?

1239
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,300
If anything, they'd want you to use your 3DS or something like that for some sort of connectivity,

1240
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,820
but whatever, okay?

1241
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,300
And then the other thing, too, is the cost of this thing, I mean, if this controller's

1242
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,580
like $100, people are like, fuck that, I ain't buying a $100 controller.

1243
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,580
I think the 3DS will stand in as a controller.

1244
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,020
I think that's how they don't bite themselves in the foot.

1245
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,380
It's a controller that will also do the 3D display.

1246
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:55,100
Okay, so let's just assume, okay, let's say that, I mean, don't get me wrong, they could

1247
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,900
come up with some really low quality screen that could, I mean, look at the PlayStation

1248
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:03,580
1 low monitors that were $50 or whatever, I mean, you put a touchscreen display on top

1249
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:07,380
of there, a touch panel display, you could, you know, kind of jerry-rig something like

1250
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,380
that.

1251
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:15,900
So, anyways, so let's say they, that's going to happen, that'd be interesting, I guess,

1252
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,220
but they're also saying that they're still going to keep the original controls as well,

1253
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:25,500
because, like I'm expecting, this system's probably just going to upscale these old Wii

1254
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,500
games.

1255
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,700
So you know how you see all this emulator footage with 1080p, new Super Mario Bros.

1256
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,900
and stuff like that, and how it looks really pretty?

1257
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,940
There you go!

1258
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:39,900
Your games are brand new again, and we can still sell Wii games, you know.

1259
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,460
I think they're even going to take one of two approaches.

1260
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,620
They're either going to try to get everybody to go up onto this new platform, or they're

1261
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,940
going to try to keep this platform along with the Wii.

1262
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,820
You know, you have the Wii for the casual people that don't want to spend a lot of money

1263
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,460
on stuff, and then you have this new system for the hardcore players that really want,

1264
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,700
you know, something that has the graphics and all that.

1265
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,700
But guess what, though?

1266
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,620
If you have those Wii games that you want to buy, they look really pretty on your new

1267
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,020
HD platform or something like that.

1268
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:10,340
But all I gotta say is- I think you are on the money on this.

1269
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,340
I really do.

1270
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,940
I hate saying when you're, I think when you talk about this, and yeah, and it's funny

1271
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,620
because somebody in chat, who said this in chat, said, Amiga777 in chat said, please

1272
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:25,460
no illusions, the dolphin GameCube had next to nothing to do with water.

1273
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,740
But I honestly think, like, what's the one place where everybody always razzes Nintendo

1274
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,900
online?

1275
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,880
What does Nintendo want a piece of?

1276
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,880
What everybody's into.

1277
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,460
That's what the Wii was all about, was trying to get everybody into gaming.

1278
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,880
Don't think they don't look at Facebook and say, hmm, how could we get a part of this?

1279
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,340
I just hope- This is the Facebook- But I just really hope that they don't try to do some

1280
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,500
stupid gimmick with this touchscreen thing, because honestly I don't need another fucking

1281
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,500
gimmick from Nintendo.

1282
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,940
I mean, let's just stop- Nintendo is a fucking lazy company.

1283
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,940
I'm sorry.

1284
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,020
They are a fucking lazy company, and you know why?

1285
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:06,240
Because they will take the least amount of effort to put out a new game.

1286
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:11,260
I mean, they're porting old shit for the 3DS, okay great, you're updating stuff.

1287
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,960
Why don't you create a damn new game?

1288
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,020
You can do it in the same style as the old game.

1289
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:19,940
You know, you did the same thing with, like, you know, the Wind Waker looking stuff on,

1290
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:24,180
you know, the DS, or I guess Wind Waker, yeah.

1291
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:30,060
So you did it, like, on the DS, but, you know, why can't you just create new games that look

1292
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,060
like the old games?

1293
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,540
Why do you have to port the old games over?

1294
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,060
It's because you don't want- You want to spend the least amount of time possible working

1295
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:42,160
on this shit, because people will buy it no matter what you put out.

1296
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,780
So what's the least possible effort that they can put in a new console?

1297
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,980
Oh, I don't know!

1298
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,280
Something that takes the old games and makes them look new.

1299
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,960
That's what you're gonna do.

1300
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,820
And then they can put out new games that look even nicer if they want, but at the same time,

1301
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,860
they don't have to do that much because they can just put out these low-quality games and

1302
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,380
they upscale everything and it looks pretty.

1303
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,140
Yeah, but I don't think- But I don't- This is not gonna be Wii 2.

1304
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,320
It's absolutely not gonna just be the Wii with enhanced graphics.

1305
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
Absolutely not.

1306
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,320
I mean, there's a whole little follow-up-

1307
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,300
But if it was, they should call it the Wii Wii.

1308
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,580
There's a follow-up article to this where they actually said they came out and said-

1309
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,580
What is this?

1310
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,680
Satoru Iwata comes out and says, quote, we would like to propose a new approach to home

1311
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,180
video game consoles.

1312
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,180
Please.

1313
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,180
Okay.

1314
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,380
A new approach to home video game consoles.

1315
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,460
So with the Wii- Is the Facebook thing.

1316
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,460
Yes.

1317
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:31,180
So with the Wii- But not actual Facebook, Nintendo book.

1318
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,740
With the Wii, they were trying to get people that were getting non-game players to play

1319
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,900
this console.

1320
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:41,340
So were they gonna try to- It's kinda hard though, because now, what are they gonna try

1321
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:48,660
to bring- Oh my god, this would be- This would be hilarious, because it'd be basically eating

1322
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,660
their own words.

1323
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,140
Wouldn't it be funny if they just like came out with something that's very similar to

1324
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,940
like the iOS marketplace or something like that, really cheap-ass games, and this whole

1325
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,220
like iPad type thing?

1326
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,220
DSiWare?

1327
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:03,500
Well, no, I understand that they have DSiWare, but you know, I'm saying to the point where

1328
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,340
it's, you know, more than three releases a week or something like that.

1329
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,140
You know, just something ridiculous and very casual games.

1330
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:14,620
I'd laugh my ass off because, you know- Oh, Apple, they're stupid, you know.

1331
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,300
Oh, then we're gonna copy them!

1332
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,340
I don't know.

1333
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:22,980
I can't really pass judgment on it yet until we actually see what it is, but I, you know-

1334
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,460
Let me put it this way.

1335
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:29,620
If it's anything like the other Nintendo promises and stuff that we've seen, a lot of it is

1336
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,620
really eye roll-worthy.

1337
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,000
I mean, seriously, remember the Wii Zapper?

1338
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,500
I mean, I go back to the Wii Zapper, you know, when they first showed it off, the prototype,

1339
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,500
it looked fucking badass.

1340
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:43,300
It was like, oh yeah, dude, that's the Zapper right there, and then when they came out with

1341
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:48,260
this plastic shell Zapper that looked like shit, it was like, what?

1342
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,260
Really?

1343
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:52,900
That's your controller?

1344
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:56,840
And speaking of which, when did we- are we ever gonna get any other controllers that

1345
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,580
plug into the bottom of the goddamn Wii remote?

1346
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,000
Because we have the nudge- No, you're not.

1347
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,180
Because they're on a new console now, so the answer is no, Loki.

1348
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,180
You're not.

1349
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,180
I can answer that for you.

1350
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,180
All these promises.

1351
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,180
You're welcome.

1352
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,500
Just never following through.

1353
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,260
Let me ask you this, because obviously you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics, it's why

1354
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,100
people love you or hate you.

1355
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,300
But yet you own a 3DS and you've owned multiple 3DSs.

1356
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,620
Yeah, but I don't play it, and I don't even know why I own it.

1357
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,820
I'm not razzing you on it.

1358
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:30,340
My true question for you is, what could Nintendo do at E3 with this console to make you go,

1359
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:33,380
okay, Nintendo, I misjudged you.

1360
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,140
You're on the right track again.

1361
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,560
Get with the times.

1362
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,700
That's what I'm saying.

1363
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,700
That's what they need to do.

1364
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,660
They need to take themselves seriously, because if they try to pull out another system that's

1365
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:47,380
just another gimmick, you know, another gimmicky system, and I'm sorry, the 3DS is kind of

1366
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,380
a gimmicky system.

1367
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:53,500
I bought into the gimmick, because all it is is a fucking DS with 3D gameplay, a little

1368
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,500
bit better graphics.

1369
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,500
But that's it.

1370
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,500
I mean, they're not really, I mean, whoopty shit.

1371
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,760
It has tilt controls on it.

1372
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:06,740
I don't want tilt controls, but whatever, you know, that's part of it.

1373
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:12,940
But I mean, if they're just, if, I need something a little bit more than just, oh look, new

1374
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,940
Mario game.

1375
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,100
Oh look, another Mario Kart.

1376
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,460
Oh look, another Zelda game.

1377
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,020
Maybe make a new franchise.

1378
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:24,260
You know, you've been dealing with these old franchises for a long ass time.

1379
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:30,420
How about creating the next good franchise, or maybe just, I don't know, putting a little

1380
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,580
bit more effort into something, because if we put out another Zelda game, you know, or

1381
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:38,980
if they take Twilight Princess and like make it look even prettier or something like that,

1382
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:42,740
or like that one Zelda game that they were showing off that was Twilight Princess at

1383
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:46,820
one point, and then they ended up, you know, scrapping that kind of look for the game because

1384
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:49,820
it's a dark, you know, Zelda game or something.

1385
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:50,820
I don't know.

1386
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:55,860
Maybe a little bit more than just Nintendo games and better graphics.

1387
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:00,740
I mean, I don't know.

1388
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,860
I would just, I want to see what they're offering.

1389
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,900
That's really, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

1390
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:10,100
But I'm sorry, I know for a fact that I'm going to be laughing my ass off during this

1391
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,100
press conference.

1392
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:17,740
You know, it's just going to be, because they have these really wacky ideas of what people

1393
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:22,420
want, but apparently it works for them, so you know, I'm not going to fault them for

1394
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:27,780
it, but you know, at the same time, there's consoles out there that I'm playing way more

1395
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,780
than Wii.

1396
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,860
Although, to be fair, my wife has gotten back to playing the Wii.

1397
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,860
I did break my Wii for a little bit, though, and I had to fix it by swapping out the motherboard,

1398
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:40,860
but you know, and then we got back into playing some of the old Wii games that we liked, like

1399
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:46,340
Excite Truck, which Nintendo, for the love of God, just make another damn Excite Truck

1400
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:51,540
game, do not make Excite Bots, just another Excite Truck game with more tracks.

1401
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,540
That'd make me happy.

1402
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,980
How about a new F-Zero?

1403
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,740
That's what I asked for on last week's show.

1404
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,740
Eh, whatever.

1405
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,020
Uh, play Speed Racer.

1406
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,020
It's pretty much F-Zero.

1407
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,980
Um, no but seriously, they just need to do that.

1408
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,220
Just make, yeah, perfect example right there.

1409
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,220
Excite Truck.

1410
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:14,420
Launch Wii title, use some of the features of the Wii that like, you know, like, oh SD

1411
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,420
memory cards.

1412
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,660
You can play your own music off the SD memory card.

1413
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,740
That's really awesome.

1414
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:22,580
It made that game so much more awesome, because you can listen to your music while you're

1415
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,100
driving in this really awesome racing game.

1416
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,100
Sequel comes out.

1417
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,100
What do they do?

1418
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,100
Oh, guess what?

1419
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,580
We need more mini games in there.

1420
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,700
Mini games do not belong in a fucking racing game.

1421
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:36,440
Oh, and then we take out the whole, you know, music playing feature, because no one really

1422
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,020
used that.

1423
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,220
Thanks, Nintendo Sony.

1424
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:45,820
Um, and then also they just add a couple extra tracks, but seriously, throwing a pie at a

1425
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,220
clown's face should never be in a racing game.

1426
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,700
Bullying should never be in a racing game.

1427
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,340
Throwing darts should never be in a racing game.

1428
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,420
Making a sandwich should never be in a racing game.

1429
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,420
Ever.

1430
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:02,420
I get that it's wacky and stuff, but it's not fucking Excite Truck.

1431
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,740
So that's what Nintendo needs to do to make you happy is stop making sandwiches.

1432
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:08,300
They need to treat us like adults instead of just little, little kids.

1433
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,300
Get it.

1434
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,300
People.

1435
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,300
Yeah, I get it.

1436
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,220
People like the party games on the Wii, because, you know, Wii is kind of a social game, but

1437
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:18,260
you don't need to make every goddamn game a party game, and you also don't need to make

1438
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,580
every damn game a family game.

1439
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,500
What about this comment from Forbes 1-1-1 in our chat, Loki?

1440
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,140
Again, they don't care about what you want.

1441
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,140
It's about the money.

1442
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,140
I retorted.

1443
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,380
If they want the money, they need to care about what we want.

1444
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,740
Well, how well did Excite Truck sell?

1445
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,740
Not very well.

1446
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,660
Maybe that's why they didn't give you more of that.

1447
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:39,180
Because they didn't advertise damn game.

1448
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:43,260
It was an awesome game, and it's really underrated, and I'm really sad that they...

1449
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,260
But here's the thing.

1450
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,500
Yeah, you're right.

1451
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:50,340
You don't have to do what I want, but I don't have to buy your console either.

1452
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,340
And you know what?

1453
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:55,740
As consoles get more expensive, and money gets tighter, I won't be buying every console

1454
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,140
that you put out.

1455
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:00,620
And yeah, the 3DS was pretty much an impulse buy, and you know what?

1456
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:05,160
Kind of have some buyer's remorse over it, because there weren't any...

1457
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,140
There weren't any really must-have games at launch, and you know what?

1458
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,500
There aren't really any must-have games in the next portion of the year.

1459
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,260
And yeah, I know Zelda's coming out.

1460
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:17,140
But as I've said before, Ocarina of Time is the most overrated fucking game on the Nintendo

1461
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,140
system ever.

1462
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,140
Agreed.

1463
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,140
So you know what?

1464
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:24,620
I'm not buying Ocarina of Time, so what's that leave me with?

1465
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,620
Fucking nothing!

1466
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,620
Because there's nothing coming out!

1467
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,620
So...

1468
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,620
Kid Icarus.

1469
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,620
Yeah, Kid Icarus.

1470
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,620
Oh, great!

1471
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:33,800
Well, then I'll enjoy my three games for the next nine months, or whatever it's gonna take

1472
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,020
for Kid Icarus to come out.

1473
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,020
So that's it.

1474
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,260
You know, we'll see what they...

1475
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,180
Netflix 3DS, that's what I'm looking forward to.

1476
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,900
We'll see what they bring to the table, you know, at E3.

1477
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:47,420
But just remember this, you know, and another thing.

1478
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,060
Here's the other thing that'll make me happy, Nintendo.

1479
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,780
When you release your console, and you're talking about the features that are gonna

1480
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:58,060
be on your console, they better not be coming in an update that's five months, three months,

1481
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,540
one month, one day after the console's release.

1482
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,180
It better be at fucking launch.

1483
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,100
It's like a stupid 3DS.

1484
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,260
Oh, it has a web browser!

1485
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,660
Oh, a feature coming later.

1486
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:07,660
Sorry.

1487
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,640
All right, let me move on to something else.

1488
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,020
Let's talk about something very serious here.

1489
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:16,780
I want to talk about Beyonce for a minute.

1490
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780
That's serious.

1491
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,820
This is very serious.

1492
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:24,940
Beyonce is being sued because, God, we love lawsuits this week.

1493
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,620
That's what we seem to be reporting on.

1494
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:30,140
Beyonce got sued for $100 million!

1495
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,260
She probably has it.

1496
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,620
Beyonce, even though her new single is terrible, just saying.

1497
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,540
But Beyonce has been sued for $100 million from Gate 5.

1498
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,540
Why is she being sued?

1499
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:45,260
Well, it's because the singer made this huge demand for more money during a crucial moment

1500
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:49,660
in the production of a game called Star Power Beyonce.

1501
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,660
That's right.

1502
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,180
They were making a game called Star Power Beyonce.

1503
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,940
I have no idea what this game would have been.

1504
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:57,420
I imagine it must be like the Michael Jackson experience or something.

1505
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,420
I don't know.

1506
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,420
She stars out of her cooch.

1507
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:03,380
A music game that involves Beyonce, where you could do the single ladies dance in the

1508
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,820
privacy of your own home.

1509
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,260
Put your hands up.

1510
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:13,140
Anyhow, Gate 5 says, we are entitled to the $6.7 million that we invested and the $100

1511
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:16,040
million in profits that we would have made.

1512
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:22,660
They had to let 70 employees go right at the Christmas season because of what Beyonce did.

1513
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:25,140
What a Grinch.

1514
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:30,980
And they want an injunction against Beyonce from commercially associating with any other

1515
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:37,060
video game or using confidential information that she got when she was working with the

1516
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,060
company.

1517
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,420
Isn't it ironic that she was in a commercial for the DS as well, I think, mid last year.

1518
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:44,920
It was the year before.

1519
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:49,360
Like she's actually going to retain any confidential information gained from a video game company.

1520
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
Like she remembered anything.

1521
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,360
That information was like poof.

1522
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,860
It just evaporated out of her head.

1523
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,860
Oh, yeah.

1524
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,860
That was real cool.

1525
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,860
You guys looks real cool.

1526
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,860
But how much you pay me?

1527
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:59,620
Seriously, she picked up nothing.

1528
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,900
Yeah.

1529
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,020
Maybe her people did.

1530
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,020
Her entourage.

1531
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,020
I don't know.

1532
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,020
Yeah.

1533
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,220
I think Jay-Z sat with her in those meetings.

1534
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,220
I'm sorry.

1535
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,380
We now have a discussion going about people buying Beyonce cootch stars.

1536
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,780
I said I would rather buy Gaga cootch stars.

1537
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,060
I wouldn't buy.

1538
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,660
How about all cootch stars?

1539
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,460
Just get all the crazy ladies.

1540
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,940
A Beyonce game sounds dumb.

1541
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:20,940
I'm sorry.

1542
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,940
It would have made money.

1543
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:26,020
It wouldn't be like the biggest video game ever, but it would have made money.

1544
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:31,020
A hundred million dollars, I mean, that's way more than if they were going to spend

1545
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,980
a hundred million dollars or they spent a hundred million dollars in this game.

1546
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,140
No, they think a hundred million is what they lost.

1547
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,140
They lost.

1548
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,140
Oh, come on.

1549
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,140
They would have never.

1550
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:42,140
They would have never made a hundred million dollars on this game.

1551
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,940
That would require them selling.

1552
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:47,060
Let's just say it's a fifty dollar retail game.

1553
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,680
And let's just say that it's all pure profit.

1554
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,900
I mean, because this is never going to.

1555
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,580
I mean, it would be way more than that.

1556
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,300
They would have to sell more than two million copies of this game to make their money back,

1557
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,100
assuming that they were getting all of the money from the actual game sale, which they're

1558
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,100
not.

1559
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,200
So, you know, they're saying that this game would have sold over two million copies.

1560
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,900
It would have not sold over two million copies.

1561
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:12,600
It would have sold two hundred thousand copies at the most.

1562
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,580
So they would have had to fire people anyway.

1563
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,580
So who cares?

1564
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:24,940
Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news, and then we're going to get to

1565
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,180
the release dates here in a little bit.

1566
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:32,180
Trying to keep the show moving right along with what was a pretty hefty news week.

1567
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:34,680
And I know there's going to be lots of phone calls tonight, so I want to keep some time

1568
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,680
open in Part B.

1569
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,680
So it's my turn?

1570
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,680
That's right.

1571
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,680
It's your turn.

1572
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,680
Tron!

1573
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,540
But you have to do the single ladies dance.

1574
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,540
No.

1575
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,540
Alright.

1576
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,540
Tron.

1577
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,940
Guess what about Tron?

1578
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,940
Pinball!

1579
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,660
Ooh, happy, happy, happy, happy.

1580
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:56,300
Yeah, I showed this to Dan, and he's like, what pinball tables can we get rid of to get

1581
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,300
this?

1582
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,300
I was actually thinking that.

1583
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,460
I was like, which pinball tables are you going to sell to buy the Tron pinball?

1584
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:06,100
Well, actually, three of our tables would equal the cost of this, which is the problem.

1585
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,100
It's going to be expensive.

1586
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,100
You know what?

1587
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,100
I think you should do it.

1588
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,220
If it were my choice, I'd get rid of Lord of the Rings, but Dan loves that table.

1589
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,220
So, anyway.

1590
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:18,700
Now, Stern, which is like the only company doing tables anymore, is putting out Tron.

1591
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:22,260
And instead of doing just their usual teaser of the cabinet art, they've actually got the

1592
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:30,580
whole play field out, which I'm going to go ahead and link an image in the chat room for

1593
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:31,580
them to look at.

1594
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:34,540
But the pictures are up at arcadeheroes.com.

1595
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,740
It's actually looking really good.

1596
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:42,900
It's got 3D models in there, the light cycles, little figures in the back.

1597
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:43,900
Plenty of ramps.

1598
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,400
Plenty of lights.

1599
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:53,260
And they're actually talking about doing a potentially limited edition where they might

1600
01:20:53,260 --> 01:21:00,260
have something other than just those monochrome LED backgrounds.

1601
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:04,860
But that's still kind of speculation.

1602
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,860
It's pretty cool.

1603
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:09,860
But the back glass is supposed to have the 3D parallax effect that's the same on the

1604
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,460
Avatar pinball.

1605
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,620
So it's going to be out sometime this month with a limited edition in June.

1606
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,020
And it looks sick.

1607
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,700
And hopefully California Extreme will have one for us to play.

1608
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,260
They had Iron Man last year.

1609
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:28,860
And on top of that, one of the other tables that Stern's doing, by the way, is the Rolling

1610
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,860
Stones.

1611
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:30,860
But it's like a $6,000 table.

1612
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:31,940
So how much is that table?

1613
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,940
This one's going to be about $4,000.

1614
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:33,940
$4,500.

1615
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,940
Something like that.

1616
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,940
That's not bad.

1617
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,940
Jeez.

1618
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,940
Well, you know, Stern printed it.

1619
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:42,700
This is the problem I have with this is that now that we don't have Williams and Midway

1620
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:47,780
doing tables anymore and Capcom is out of the game, Stern's really the only company

1621
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:48,780
there is.

1622
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,740
They can charge what they want.

1623
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:58,060
They have the Williams collection coming out on the 3DS in June, I think.

1624
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,060
That's kind of cool.

1625
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,060
I've got the Williams tables, I will.

1626
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:05,900
Yeah, that game has been re-released so many damn times by Crave.

1627
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:10,380
I thought Crave closed down, but yeah, they're still making games.

1628
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,380
Porting games.

1629
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,380
I don't know.

1630
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:20,100
Oh, I, you know, and this is my thing, as much as I love video pinball, nothing compares

1631
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,480
to the real thing.

1632
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:26,980
So I would almost always go out and hunt down a good pinball table than have...

1633
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:30,180
So you wouldn't be interested in like a pin maim table?

1634
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,260
Like an actual, you know...

1635
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,260
I played a pin maim.

1636
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,780
And you know what?

1637
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,500
It was fun, but not my thing.

1638
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:41,940
It was, I mean, and I'll tell you what I did because a few years ago they had one at California

1639
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:45,860
Extreme and right next to it was Black Knight 2000.

1640
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,860
And I played Black Knight 2000 on the pin maim and then I played Black Knight 2000 on

1641
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:52,620
the real thing and it's just...

1642
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,580
You just can't get the same feel.

1643
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,260
It's a very good simulacrum.

1644
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:05,060
I mean, pin maim itself is very well done, but it's just not the same.

1645
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,060
I want to go ahead.

1646
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,540
I don't, I can't remember very often in the history of our show that we do this, but there

1647
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:14,580
is a real world that goes on out there outside of us and not just what's happening in the

1648
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,580
world of video games.

1649
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:19,180
And if you are all about 100% video games, I do encourage you to go outside once in a

1650
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,180
while.

1651
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,900
But needless to say, there's a lot going on in the real world right now.

1652
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:26,820
They are saying that President Obama is scheduled to address the nation any minute now.

1653
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:31,020
I guess it's supposed to happen at 1030 Eastern, but it's running a little late.

1654
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,260
I take this with a grain of salt.

1655
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,260
We'll find out in the next few minutes.

1656
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,380
I'm looking at what is usually a pretty respectable source.

1657
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:42,300
It does sound like Osama bin Laden is dead and the US has the body and that's what Obama

1658
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,380
is expected to announce the next few minutes.

1659
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,380
I hope.

1660
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,340
That is not confirmed.

1661
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:51,340
I'm getting that from a source that's usually pretty right on about these things.

1662
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,340
So more to develop.

1663
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:55,000
So I do encourage you, if you are listening to the show, you might just want to keep CNN

1664
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,280
open in another tab and furiously hit refresh on that because if that is the news, that's

1665
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,340
obviously going to have people talking about more than just games for quite some time.

1666
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:12,460
And then he invites in the guy from, the announcer from NBA Jam, Boom Shakalaka.

1667
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:16,900
Did you, by the way, not meaning to really derail so much, but did you see the White

1668
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,420
House correspondent's speech?

1669
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,420
I did.

1670
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,420
That was brilliant.

1671
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:21,420
I love that.

1672
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,420
I love that man.

1673
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,420
Good times.

1674
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,260
I love that I voted for him.

1675
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,780
His sense of humor is amazing.

1676
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:27,780
Um, all right.

1677
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:34,420
I, again, I just, I just know where to look for information and rumors that are usually

1678
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:35,420
right on.

1679
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,420
Hold on.

1680
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,420
Hold on.

1681
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,420
Let me just put a funny, maybe more of an image in your face.

1682
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:45,020
Um, wouldn't it be hilarious if they just pulled a whole fucking weekend at Bernie's?

1683
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,020
Oh shit.

1684
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,020
Stop it.

1685
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,020
Here's Osama bin Laden.

1686
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,580
He's waving his hand.

1687
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,580
All right.

1688
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:51,580
Moving on.

1689
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,580
Moving on.

1690
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,580
Thank you.

1691
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,660
Uh, Bobby actually gave me the original tip on that.

1692
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:55,660
So thank you, Bobby.

1693
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:59,460
Who told me to go look at CNN and that made me think to go, uh, check, uh, my tweet.

1694
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,460
Yeah.

1695
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:04,380
It's, it's again, not official, but my guy on Twitter who tends to be on top of this

1696
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,700
stuff is rolling out all these sources that seem to point to that's being the case.

1697
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,380
Well that, that'd be, uh, interesting.

1698
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,780
That would be extremely interesting to say the least.

1699
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:18,500
Anyway, we, the show must go on as they say, but I do know we live in a multitask world.

1700
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:22,540
So those of you listening live may wish to all tab to CNN, but please don't turn us off.

1701
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:27,340
Um, we'll, if, if the news is, if they confirm it or whatever it is, I will relay it for

1702
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,340
you guys.

1703
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,340
Okay.

1704
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,340
How about I keep the website up and I'll keep an eye on it.

1705
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,340
All right.

1706
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,340
Okay.

1707
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,340
Uh, moving on.

1708
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,700
Let's talk about release dates and what is coming, uh, soon to a gaming, uh, store near

1709
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,700
you.

1710
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,700
Yes.

1711
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,820
These games may not be able to be played by Osama bin Laden very soon, but, um, coming

1712
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:48,300
next week, Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska for the Nintendo Wii, if you like your hunting

1713
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,500
and you like your Alaska hunting and you like your Sarah Palin, but she's not in the game,

1714
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,940
um, can't hunt her either.

1715
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,540
So I don't know.

1716
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:58,540
It's budget price.

1717
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,540
I guess that might be good.

1718
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:06,140
Uh, Thor God of Thunder or God of movie tie-in game that is coming out on PlayStation three,

1719
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:12,420
Xbox 360, Wii, uh, DS, and, uh, that's it.

1720
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,420
No 3DS.

1721
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,420
Unfortunately that got delayed.

1722
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:20,780
Yeah, you'd think it'd be easy to port over, um, also the game that I've been highly raving

1723
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:26,940
about and I sadly enough haven't been playing much of it lately, just for no reason whatsoever,

1724
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:29,660
but a Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on PlayStation three.

1725
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:35,660
If you like racing games and you like crazy destruction and just all sorts of insane stuff

1726
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:39,360
going on while you're racing, seriously go pick this game up.

1727
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,140
It's just amazing.

1728
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:48,980
So that's coming on PlayStation three this week and, um, sadly that is it.

1729
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:53,260
That is all kind of good stuff for the rest of May though, but, uh, just unfortunately

1730
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:56,100
next week is a little what are some other highlights in May just so I know what I should

1731
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,100
be looking at.

1732
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:02,420
Uh, well, uh, in two weeks we have a brink, which is going to be an awesome first person

1733
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,420
shooter from Bethesda that's coming out, uh, Lego pirates.

1734
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:11,420
If you're into that kind of thing, uh, MX versus ATV alive, if you like that, uh, and

1735
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:15,700
then two weeks the game I'm looking forward to LA noir from rockstar games coming out.

1736
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,620
Yes, there's quite a few people looking forward to that.

1737
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,060
So that's going to be awesome.

1738
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:23,500
And then of course, uh, towards the end of the month, uh, if you are a big fan of racing,

1739
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:29,220
uh, dirt three coming out and a hunted the demons forge, um, if you're into those types

1740
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,220
of games.

1741
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:33,140
Um, unfortunately actually a lot of stuff that was supposed to become a month, fear

1742
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:37,460
three, dungeon siege three and red faction all got delayed to June, but red faction looks

1743
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,460
pretty good too.

1744
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:43,520
Although it's kind of got a dead space vibe and I don't know, not really feeling dead

1745
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,520
space.

1746
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,260
So, but LA noir looks awesome.

1747
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:49,940
So that's probably the next game I'll pick up and maybe brink, brink looks pretty cool

1748
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:50,940
too.

1749
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:55,020
All right, let's move on to Japan and what is going on with Japanese releases.

1750
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,780
Um, this week, uh, Xbox three 60 is looking pretty dry.

1751
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:01,100
There's not a lot going on the Xbox three 60 I'm, I have a feeling they have a quiet

1752
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,380
week too cause they don't have anything on the PlayStation three as well.

1753
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,620
I wonder if they have something huge on the handhelds.

1754
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:09,900
Um, nothing on the Wii obviously because there's just nothing happening on the Wii these days

1755
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,220
on the Sony PSP.

1756
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,580
Yeah, nothing's happening until May 12th.

1757
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,300
I'm not seeing anything.

1758
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:20,860
There is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week.

1759
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,180
That's it.

1760
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,180
That's the releases.

1761
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:28,580
Uh, May 12th steel diver on the, on the three DS, uh, which we've had here obviously since

1762
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,580
release.

1763
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:34,060
Uh, major league baseball on the 12th, but as far as the fifth, which the games are usually

1764
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,060
out on Fridays.

1765
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,060
Uh, nothing.

1766
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,060
Wow.

1767
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:41,900
It could be, it could be that all that's going on in the world as far as Japan is maybe shuffled

1768
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,900
some things up.

1769
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:43,900
I mean, it's don't know.

1770
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,900
Possibly.

1771
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:49,740
Well, we have a few releases for the UK on the fourth is Bongio HD missile fury for Xbox

1772
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:55,380
three 60 Bongio is so much fun and there's section eight prejudice for PC and on the

1773
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:02,020
sixth is sniper ghost warriors, steel diver, and Cabela's dangerous hunts to 2011.

1774
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:08,700
Ooh, that's what I say about that.

1775
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,700
All right.

1776
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,700
Well, so much for release dates.

1777
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,780
It's looking a little dry, no matter what part of the world you're in.

1778
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,460
Uh, so let's go to Loki.

1779
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,460
All right.

1780
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,500
Um, well there's some interest.

1781
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,420
The chat was yelling at me because I said the release dates are looking pretty dry in

1782
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,420
Japan.

1783
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,420
You guys are dummies.

1784
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,620
All right.

1785
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:30,300
I mean that with love, but seriously, all right, Loki, um, Sony revealed two new tablet

1786
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,660
devices that are gonna be part of the PlayStation suite.

1787
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:42,260
Um, one of them, uh, I guess they're officially the S one and S two tablets, which great.

1788
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:43,260
That's nice.

1789
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:49,020
Uh, they're both running Android 3.0 and uh, the S one tablet I guess has, there's any

1790
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,700
like kind of an unconventional design.

1791
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:56,140
It looks like that it's, uh, I don't know, it kind of tapers a little bit.

1792
01:29:56,140 --> 01:30:01,020
So it's like on a slant, but uh, basically 9.4 inch screen.

1793
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:07,740
And then of course the S two tablet, it's a dual screen tablet and you know, people

1794
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:09,820
are calling it looks saying it looks like the DS.

1795
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:13,980
I guess you can, you know, run two different things at the same time.

1796
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:17,460
You can watch a video and chat, you know, at the same time on the other screen or use

1797
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:20,940
the other screen as a soft keyboard and you know, whatever.

1798
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:27,980
Uh, but there are two 5.5 inch screens and um, both of course will be able to play select

1799
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,540
PlayStation one games.

1800
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:30,540
Tangible buttons.

1801
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:31,540
Nope.

1802
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,540
Couldn't care less.

1803
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,540
Exactly.

1804
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:38,460
So yeah, I'm not interested unless they were to have tangible buttons cause can you imagine

1805
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,700
playing a PlayStation one game on your iPhone?

1806
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:45,100
Cause that's what this is basically.

1807
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:51,900
I mean seriously, so, all right, uh, anyhow, let's move on to, uh, another story.

1808
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,260
This is also kind of a followup cause uh, last week in the middle of the show, uh, some

1809
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:59,300
details were breaking on, well, I guess it was really that day, fantasy star online two

1810
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,300
details.

1811
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,860
Uh, we're getting some more information on what that was all about.

1812
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:10,220
So there was a PSP two promotion event that was in Akihabara, uh, over last week.

1813
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:17,620
And um, let's see, there was, uh, more information released on fantasy star online to, uh, apparently

1814
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,380
now you're going to be able to jump in the game.

1815
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:26,900
Also randomly generated hunting areas, some third person shooter style game play, uh,

1816
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,900
and so on.

1817
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,260
So they're adding jumping into it.

1818
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:33,260
That could, uh, certainly make the levels different randomly generated hunting areas.

1819
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:38,140
See, I seem to remember the levels in the old, uh, fantasy star games were online ones

1820
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:39,940
were kind of randomly generated.

1821
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:43,780
It seemed like there were like three different types of levels you could get.

1822
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:47,980
So it'd be kind of neat if it's like a truly random generation thing going on.

1823
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,740
So more information going on out there.

1824
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:54,180
There's even a little video, but it looks like it was taken down.

1825
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,900
So there you go.

1826
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:56,900
All right.

1827
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,660
So, uh, what's going on over there?

1828
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:04,440
Real, you guys are watching real world and, uh, it was just said national journal learned

1829
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,440
it's true.

1830
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,060
It says, uh, yeah, according to MSNBC, they're saying president Obama make a statement soon

1831
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:13,020
regarding Osama bin Laden, Fox news saying that New York times is saying it.

1832
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,420
So it looks like, uh, there you go.

1833
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:16,420
All right.

1834
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:20,900
Sweet back to, uh, again, keep CNN open in another tab.

1835
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:21,900
Uh, there you go.

1836
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,020
If you're listening to the show or whatever your, I say CNN, but whatever your website

1837
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,020
of choice is.

1838
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,020
Okay.

1839
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:29,020
Kids.

1840
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,020
All right.

1841
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,020
BBC news.

1842
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,620
Let's get to something extremely important.

1843
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,780
This could be almost more important.

1844
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:38,660
It isn't more important, but almost if there was anything that was as important, it would

1845
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:44,020
be this, a trip down memory lane for dark Sakura where every week she decides, Hey,

1846
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:49,900
you guys should be playing this video game classic game of the week.

1847
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:50,900
Dark Sakura.

1848
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,540
Tell us about what is the classic game of the week.

1849
01:32:53,540 --> 01:33:00,300
The game of the week is afterburner, which came out in 1987 it's a flight SIM arcade

1850
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,960
game put out by Sega.

1851
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,900
It had a motion full motion seats, um, at least for the deluxe cabinet.

1852
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,940
It was also designed by you Suzuki who is the man.

1853
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:17,580
Um, anyway, you control an F 14 Tomcat and you go through 18 stages and you take off

1854
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:23,260
from an aircraft character called the Sega enterprise, which is a, an homage to top gun

1855
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:25,700
and not star Trek.

1856
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:32,500
And so the, it had basically of integrated flight stick that would control the way the

1857
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:38,420
cabinet moved either back and forth and it had, you know, hydraulics in it and it would

1858
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,340
have Canada missile buttons.

1859
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:45,940
It was also a stand, um, a standing upright one, but the rotating cockpit one was the

1860
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,660
awesome one.

1861
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:53,360
So, um, it was, I mean, basically it's just straightforward.

1862
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:59,060
You shoot down planes and you have like a lock for your missiles and you can shoot them

1863
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,380
down and you choose, you know, your direction.

1864
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:06,060
There's also afterburner two, which was the sequel that was put out the same year.

1865
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:12,780
And um, then, uh, there were other games that focus on the F 14 Tomcat, like G lock air

1866
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:18,460
battle and strike fighter that was actually rebranded as afterburner three and then sky

1867
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,460
target.

1868
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:25,660
There was also Sega strike fighter, which was, uh, a free roaming type of F 14 game.

1869
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:29,300
And then we got afterburner climax, which is the one that I played just this week.

1870
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,300
That's really sweet.

1871
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,580
There's also a PSP, um, release called afterburner black Falcon.

1872
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:40,220
And uh, actually some of the music in this was, uh, remixed for Bayonetta.

1873
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,660
It was pretty cool.

1874
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:46,740
As far as other versions that have been out, there was Amiga, the Amstrad, the Atari ST,

1875
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:52,700
sharp X68000, at them towns, Commodore 64, Nest, Sega master system, PC engine, Sega

1876
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:55,980
Saturn, PC, MSX, and ZX spectrum.

1877
01:34:55,980 --> 01:35:01,660
And then, um, there was a 32 X version that was called, um, afterburner complete in Japan

1878
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:02,660
in Europe.

1879
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,100
But I'll tell you what's cool about that.

1880
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:08,340
And also is the same for space Harrier on 32 X is that it's the arcade version, the

1881
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:09,380
full arcade version.

1882
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:13,820
You can actually do a little trick to make it say insert coin, you know, so it's kind

1883
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:14,820
of, kind of neat.

1884
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:17,220
It's, it's pretty much the same rom.

1885
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:22,780
And the little article here has a few other, uh, uh, bits and pieces like in Terminator

1886
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:26,140
2 Judgment Day, John Connor's playing afterburner.

1887
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:28,380
Oh, that's right.

1888
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,380
I forgot about that.

1889
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:30,380
Yeah, he is.

1890
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:38,100
And in red dwarf seasons two and three, there was an afterburner in the bar area and pretty

1891
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,100
cool.

1892
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,100
Yeah.

1893
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,580
I love the music in this game.

1894
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:44,580
I'm really surprised you have never done afterburner before.

1895
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:50,740
Well, in an afterburner, I have to say is not one of my favorite games, but I love afterburner

1896
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,740
climb.

1897
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,740
I love the cabin.

1898
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:58,800
Well, afterburner climax actually has a full, um, full on hydraulic seats that has front

1899
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,460
backside up down motion.

1900
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,980
So it's super, super fun.

1901
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:07,140
And the other thing that was really great about these is that they did include a motion

1902
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,140
stop.

1903
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,140
So if you couldn't take it, it would just stop the movement.

1904
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,140
It was pretty cool.

1905
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,460
But yeah, afterburner.

1906
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,740
All right.

1907
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:18,140
There it is your classic game of the week.

1908
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:24,060
Liberty afterburner best known in its arcade release, but certainly ported to plenty of

1909
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:25,060
home consoles.

1910
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:26,060
All right.

1911
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,700
We're going to take a quick break here, uh, at orange launch radio, but don't go anywhere

1912
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,700
guys.

1913
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,500
We're going to be right back with plenty more of the show tonight.

1914
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:35,480
Uh, we've been talking a lot about PlayStation, but there's been big news on Xbox this week

1915
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,480
as well.

1916
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,480
So we're gonna talk about that as well.

1917
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,340
Uh, some 3DS news as well.

1918
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:41,300
And Loki is going to bring us some hacking news.

1919
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:51,420
All we come back after a quick break with more of orange lounge radio.

1920
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,740
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

1921
01:36:53,740 --> 01:37:00,020
We are live on this Sunday evening, May the 1st of 2011 with the 411th episode of our

1922
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:05,020
show where we're giving you not just the four one one on what's going on with PSN and all

1923
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,620
that stuff, but apparently what's going on in the real world as well.

1924
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:12,380
Uh, it's quite a, uh, exciting evening, but in the interest of those that are, uh, we'll

1925
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:15,380
keep you abreast of anything huge develops, but in the interest of those that listen to

1926
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:21,980
the podcast throughout the week, by the time this will be long reported to death, uh, yes.

1927
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:26,180
There's one little announcement that's going to be closer to 1130 central time that the

1928
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,180
announcement will be made.

1929
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:31,100
They're still working on final statements, but everything's set up.

1930
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:36,060
So that will be 9 30 Pacific for our live listeners.

1931
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,060
All right.

1932
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,060
So let's move on though with the show.

1933
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,380
We want to get back into video games, especially out of the interest of those that listen to

1934
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,380
the show throughout the week.

1935
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:46,100
By the time this has been long reported on, I'm going to name my first born wolf after

1936
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,100
Wolf Blitzer.

1937
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,740
Yes, because Wolf was a freaking bad ass.

1938
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:51,860
How about what was the name of the dog that played piano on the Muppets?

1939
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:52,860
Was that Ralph?

1940
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:53,860
Ralph.

1941
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,860
I like that.

1942
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:55,860
No wolf.

1943
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,860
How about what if you have twins?

1944
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:57,860
Can you have Wolf and Ralph?

1945
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:03,540
I'll have Wolf and uh, Wolf and Fox.

1946
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:04,540
All right.

1947
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,020
Let's move on back into the show.

1948
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:07,820
Uh, first spinoff shows.

1949
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,540
If you'd like orange launch radio, there's some other shows you might like as well.

1950
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:14,340
Uh, I do one, it's called the best little hoard house in the Azeroth.

1951
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,140
It's a show about all things world of Warcraft.

1952
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,140
This week was a fun week.

1953
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:18,500
It was our international edition.

1954
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:23,660
We had this gal seal from the, uh, girls gone wild podcast and she is a Dutch lady living

1955
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:28,100
in the UK South East, I know she's Southwest and the Southwest part of the UK.

1956
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,220
I saw you use the underwear picture.

1957
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,220
What's that?

1958
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,220
Oh yeah.

1959
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,220
The album art.

1960
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,220
Yes.

1961
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,220
For your album art.

1962
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:37,460
The album art for a word house changes every episode.

1963
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:38,460
I don't know.

1964
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,460
It's just a thing.

1965
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:42,260
Something I want to do for a house and a dark soccer has actually been probably about two

1966
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,340
thirds of the art has come from dark soccer's pictures.

1967
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:49,140
Uh, the third mind, I've actually tried to capture like different events that happen

1968
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:53,700
in the game that people will recognize, you know, like the one I've got of, uh, my character

1969
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,780
sitting with the turtle when you are in high jaw.

1970
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:57,780
Right.

1971
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:58,780
So I like crazy stuff.

1972
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,180
So if you like a world of Warcraft and all that, and it's a busy week, this is a busy

1973
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:03,180
news week too.

1974
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:08,300
The 4.1, that big patch hit and the 4.2 patch, lots of news coming out on that, uh, patch

1975
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:10,500
and it's going to be very awesome.

1976
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,060
All right.

1977
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,060
So anyhow, you want to hear more?

1978
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,060
Wow.

1979
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,060
Geekery.

1980
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,060
Check it out.

1981
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,060
Hoardhouse.com dark soccer.

1982
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,060
You got a show.

1983
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,060
Call it comic insanity.

1984
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:22,040
Although we haven't done one for a month now because we've just had a lot of stuff going

1985
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:27,220
on in the world of comics is not that much exciting, but you can find us at infamous.net

1986
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:35,300
and we should have a new one I think next week, so keep, keep your, your, uh, eyes open

1987
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,300
on the website.

1988
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,300
We're pretty cool.

1989
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:42,340
I do it with, uh, with Mara and Marvel and Dan shadow and we're cool.

1990
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:44,100
All right.

1991
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,420
And you actually came back this week?

1992
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,420
No, we didn't.

1993
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,420
Cause she, she's in Disneyland.

1994
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,420
Oh, bitch.

1995
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:50,420
We're going.

1996
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:52,180
And I mean that babe in total control of herself.

1997
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,180
We're going.

1998
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,180
Yes.

1999
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:55,180
I don't know.

2000
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,180
And it's her, it's for her birthday.

2001
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:59,900
I don't know how to talk about this, how openly, but there's like this awesome Disneyland trip

2002
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,900
happening very soon.

2003
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:04,860
Well, not very soon, but soon that's going to involve at least one other person, not

2004
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:05,860
in this room.

2005
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:07,860
It's going to be epic epicness.

2006
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,900
So more to come on that later.

2007
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,900
Anyhow.

2008
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:11,900
All right.

2009
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,900
Let's move on.

2010
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,220
Rapid fire news.

2011
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:19,060
All the stuff that, uh, we just don't have 20 minutes to talk about, especially in light

2012
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:23,980
of all the PSN and real world news going on tonight, but we wanted to tip our hat to these

2013
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:24,980
stories.

2014
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:25,980
Oh, one thing.

2015
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:28,660
They said it was officially killed by the U S okay.

2016
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:29,660
All right.

2017
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:30,660
Of course.

2018
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:35,020
We wouldn't be announcing it if we didn't do it ourselves or we didn't say, yeah, those

2019
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:42,220
guys in the UK, you know, we could end the show early if you guys just want to focus

2020
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,220
on this.

2021
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:46,960
No, I realize it's important news, but I'm just, I'm worried about the podcast he's listening

2022
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,740
throughout the week who have probably heard this a million times by now.

2023
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,740
All right.

2024
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:52,740
Anyways.

2025
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:59,500
So red box is now finally rolling out game rentals, um, for all of their, uh, kiosks,

2026
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,980
uh, 21,000 to be exact.

2027
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:02,980
Well, not exactly.

2028
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,980
I guess that's kind of an estimate.

2029
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:11,660
Um, starting June 17th and, uh, those rentals will run you $2 a day and they're going to

2030
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:17,700
be a guest, um, including some of the top AAA games and some family games as well.

2031
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,500
Um, so that's pretty awesome.

2032
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:25,300
So if you're looking for another place to rent games and you know, maybe just game flies

2033
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:29,740
and getting stuff to you quick enough, you can, uh, check out a red box machine, which

2034
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:32,820
are everywhere now.

2035
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:38,920
Death Smiles 2X has been rated by the ESRB and of course we could probably expect that

2036
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,700
on the Xbox 360 marketplace very soon.

2037
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:48,260
Um, of course they've been putting a lot of other cave shmup games on there.

2038
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:54,500
So you know, I wouldn't expect this to be too much different than some of the other

2039
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,500
cave shooters.

2040
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,700
But if you like your shmup games, uh, more coming.

2041
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,620
So that's pretty cool.

2042
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:05,160
And then finally, uh, first there was a leaked teaser and then officially announced Need

2043
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:12,660
For Speed The Run is coming to stores November 15th in the North American regions, November

2044
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:14,460
17th in Europe.

2045
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:19,860
And of course, um, it is rumored that EA Black Box is the one doing the game.

2046
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:24,100
And they're saying that apparently, uh, it will be kind of a cross country cannonball

2047
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:28,300
run style game from San Francisco to New York.

2048
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:32,300
And not only will you be racing against, you know, police and whatnot, but you'll also

2049
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:37,140
be racing through like dense urban traffic, icy mountain passes and Nero Canyon.

2050
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:41,960
So kind of a little bit of, uh, you versus the elements versus police and stuff.

2051
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:48,340
So sounds pretty chaotic, might be fun and that'll be coming out this fall.

2052
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:52,620
Well did you hear the one about Marshfield, Massachusetts and you're probably like, what?

2053
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:53,740
Unless you live there.

2054
01:42:53,740 --> 01:43:00,380
Uh, but yeah, Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1982, they actually banned arcade games from

2055
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:02,080
public establishments.

2056
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,080
That's right.

2057
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:07,140
You're not allowed to have a coin op game in an establishment in Marshfield, Massachusetts.

2058
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,500
It's like footloose for video games.

2059
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,500
Kind of.

2060
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,580
The law was actually upheld once by the state Supreme Court the next year and it's always

2061
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,420
been in place since then.

2062
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,760
Uh, however, uh, they might actually be, and the reason why this is relevant now, 29 years

2063
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:25,060
later is that they are looking at possibly reversing that law.

2064
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:29,260
Uh, state law actually permits Keno to be allowed in bars and other buildings.

2065
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:32,300
So what the hell is wrong with coin op games existing?

2066
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:37,340
Uh, the town meeting is happening this next week and voters will be able to overturn the

2067
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,340
law.

2068
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:39,540
Uh, so it'll be up to the voters.

2069
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:43,500
So if you know anyone there, uh, you probably want to get them to vote to overturn this

2070
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,500
law.

2071
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:47,900
Although at the same time, I suppose if they've gotten by for 29 years without coin op games

2072
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:50,300
in town, they'll probably get by another 29.

2073
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:53,260
There's also that part of me that says, what coin op games?

2074
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:58,300
Cause you know, outside of the Tron pinball news we had earlier, there's not a lot of

2075
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,820
games going on.

2076
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:04,160
Anyhow, um, a game that's rumored to be coming out on the connect fruit ninja.

2077
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,300
It's a very popular game, of course, on the iPhone and iPad devices.

2078
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:12,980
Fruit Ninja connect is apparently a game that's just recently been rated in Korea.

2079
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:16,740
That's not usually the country we get our rating board leaks from, but, uh, it is what

2080
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:17,740
it is.

2081
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:21,860
Fruit Ninja connect has been leaked as a rated game in Korea.

2082
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:24,780
Uh, of course they don't say what system this is for.

2083
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:28,340
Well, I mean they, it's for the 360, excuse me, but they don't say if it's a disc game

2084
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:31,380
or an Xbox live arcade game or how it's being delivered.

2085
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:36,460
My assumption is that it's going to be an Xbox live arcade game just based on what the

2086
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,020
source material is.

2087
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:40,660
But we won't know for a little while.

2088
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:44,000
Uh, also one other piece of the thing came to light this week.

2089
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,500
Apparently there was a Sonic skating board game or sorry, skateboarding game that went

2090
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,820
unreleased during the Xbox era.

2091
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:56,620
Uh, it was discovered by a post on the Sonic retro fan site at Sonic retro.org.

2092
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:59,140
Uh, it was a game called Sonic extreme.

2093
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:00,700
It was by the Sonic team.

2094
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:05,260
It was for the original Xbox and it was very similar to the skateboarding stuff in Sonic

2095
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:09,500
adventure two, uh, but apparently it was a whole game based around it.

2096
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:13,540
Uh, or it could be what ended up being Sonic writers.

2097
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:17,220
Not sure, but there's some video out there that has leaked and you can check that out

2098
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:23,740
either on YouTube or at that Sonic retro site, Sonic retro.org also known as when Sonic was

2099
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:24,740
good.org.

2100
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:26,940
That was my little joke.

2101
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:34,020
All right, let's move on, uh, to some more rapid fire news, dark Sakura.

2102
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:41,620
While we do have some news for fans of black ops, uh, there is going to be a download content

2103
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:47,060
pack called call of the dead as George Romero as himself.

2104
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:51,500
Um, basically it's a lots of a zombie fan service.

2105
01:45:51,500 --> 01:46:00,420
It's going to be making the dead go splat and uh, it should be a pretty neat.

2106
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:06,140
Then, um, we have, uh, blaze blue shirts that are going for Japan relief.

2107

01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:26,500

01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:37,420
So let me get what's on the list for you.

That's going to be of course, Xbox 360, Wii and PS3.

2116
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:45,060
The individual songs are going to be, do you really want to hurt me?

2117
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:50,420
Um, from, uh, from out of nowhere by faith, no more working for the weekend by lover boys,

2118
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:56,380
stashed by fish, tweezer by fish and big bang baby by stone temple pilots.

2119
01:46:56,380 --> 01:47:01,660
And that last one and working for the weekend also have pro guitar bass expansions available.

2120
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:04,140
Oh, and so does, um, stashed by fish.

2121
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:06,020
Fish is cool.

2122
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:09,540
So yay.

2123
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,540
All right.

2124
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:13,780
Um, real quick to kind of add on a little bit what you were saying about the called

2125
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:14,780
it an expansion.

2126
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:20,380
Uh, not only does it have, uh, George Romero, he is playing this crazy Uber zombie in it.

2127
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:23,580
Uh, but it also has Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Michelle Geller.

2128
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:24,580
I'm sorry.

2129
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,340
Yeah, that would be, that's way better.

2130
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:31,820
Sarah Michelle Parker or, uh, Sarah Jessica Parker would probably, she'd be like a plastic

2131
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,820
zombie.

2132
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:33,820
Yes.

2133
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:34,820
A plastic zombie.

2134
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:35,820
No.

2135
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:40,860
Um, Michael Rooker, uh, Danny Trejo and, uh, Robert Englund and, um, yeah, all, all kind

2136
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:47,660
of, almost like playing themselves, you know, like they've got, you know, um, Robert Englund

2137
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:52,940
has kind of like some catch phrases that sort of, you know, hint at, you know, Nightmare

2138
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:58,620
on Elm Street and he has a pitchfork and then Danny Trejo has a machete and, uh, Michael

2139
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:00,900
Rooker kind of looks like a biker.

2140
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:05,660
So, um, looks pretty neat.

2141
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,660
All right.

2142
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,820
Well, let's move on to some Twitter topics.

2143
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:14,460
Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash O L R tweet, tweet, tweet, uh, and,

2144
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:19,060
uh, you guys send us your tweets and we read them live here on the show.

2145
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:24,780
Let's go to, uh, the first tweet tonight from Rhetortainment tweets us saying, I like putting

2146
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:26,300
corn on my tax.

2147
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,300
Is this weird?

2148
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,620
I don't even like, is there a joke there?

2149
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,620
Is there an inside joke there?

2150
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:35,300
I'm not getting, I like to put corn on my tax corn tax, like, like, I don't know.

2151
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:38,980
Is that like corn on the cob or maybe a play on contact?

2152
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:39,980
Maybe.

2153
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:40,980
I don't know.

2154
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:41,980
Rhetortainment.

2155
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:42,980
Explain yourself.

2156
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:43,980
All right.

2157
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:44,980
Flaming toilets.

2158
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:46,580
Uh, tweeting us saying, are you going to talk about PlayStation network?

2159
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:48,220
Cause nobody's talked about that yet.

2160
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:52,260
Uh, yes, we are going to talk about it and now we're done talking about it.

2161
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:56,740
Uh, let's see more tweets, uh, DJ Rama S tweets us and says, Hey, what's your definition

2162
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:57,740
of shovelware?

2163
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:58,740
Good question.

2164
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,340
What's your definition of shovelware?

2165
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:05,580
My definition of shovelware is a game that is so blatant in copying another game.

2166
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:08,380
You just, you can't even tell.

2167
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:09,380
That's right.

2168
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:14,340
A very, very rushed game that is put out for the sole purpose of capitalizing on what's

2169
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,340
popular.

2170
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:21,740
In dark soccer, Loki, anything you guys want to add to that game with next to none, uh,

2171
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:22,740
production values?

2172
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:24,660
I mean, it just looks like crap.

2173
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,660
Everything's broken in it.

2174
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:29,540
It's just think of the ditch.

2175
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:31,360
It's absolutely useless.

2176
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,340
You shun your friends for buying it.

2177
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:36,980
Is there any traditional value in dirt?

2178
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:38,980
No, neither.

2179
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:44,100
Is there any entertainment value of shovelware?

2180
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,100
All right.

2181
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,780
Let's see one or a couple more tweets.

2182
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,780
Excuse me.

2183
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:51,660
Blue swim is tweeting us saying, shit, Loki, and that's it.

2184
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:52,660
No shit.

2185
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:55,100
Loki talked about what I was going to call or about.

2186
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,380
Got to rethink my call.

2187
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:01,340
We could call in and just be a Loki fan and just be like, yeah, I agree with you, man.

2188
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:03,420
On second thought, let's not inflate his ego anymore.

2189
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,420
All right.

2190
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,700
Uh, other tweets.

2191
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:06,860
Oh, this is one.

2192
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:07,860
Yeah.

2193
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:08,860
Gosh.

2194
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:09,860
This slipped off the radar here.

2195
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:10,860
We want to say something about this.

2196
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:11,860
Thank you to tiger claw who tweeted this.

2197
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:15,660
There were some details on Marvel universe because you know, DC universe online cannot

2198
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,660
go unchallenged.

2199
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:19,780
Uh, there were some details on Marvel universe revealed this week.

2200
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,900
It was at a event in San Francisco by gazillion.

2201
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:24,620
Uh, the game is being developed by secret identity.

2202
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:29,020
Uh, that's a team that was specifically assembled to make the MMO.

2203
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:32,140
It's going to be a free to play MMO.

2204
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,180
Get that Marvel universe is going to be free dark soccer.

2205
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:36,180
Any interest in that?

2206
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:37,180
A free to play Marvel MMO.

2207
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,180
I'll be all over that.

2208
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,180
Yeah.

2209
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,180
Is it a freemium?

2210
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:43,580
Uh, well I'm assuming it has to be, if it's free to play, it's freemium.

2211
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,580
Absolutely.

2212
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:47,420
Um, but oh, I've actually remembered reading something about this.

2213
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:54,500
Um, cause I follow, um, uh, agent M on Twitter and apparently I think he said it or somebody

2214
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,660
with Marvel said it that Bendis has a hand in the writing.

2215
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:58,660
So that's pretty cool.

2216
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:02,060
Uh, dr doom is going to be the antagonist, at least in the launch of the game.

2217
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:05,580
They're saying that you will be able to play as famous Marvel heroes, captain America,

2218
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:11,100
iron man, Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, Nova, and squirrel girl squirrel girl is awesome.

2219
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,100
I have no idea.

2220
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:16,940
I mean, if everybody's the hero, so there must be like an instance thing or maybe kind

2221
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:20,620
of what they do in DC universe where it's, I don't know, it's Jessica Jones.

2222
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:21,900
I'm very curious.

2223
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:25,300
Uh, Brian Michael Bendis is doing some writing for the game.

2224
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,540
Uh, the game story missions are taken from the comic themselves.

2225
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:33,100
Uh, otherwise don't know if it has to do with anything to do with the Marvel universe online.

2226
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:37,900
The cryptic was once developing in Microsoft, uh, before that project was canceled.

2227
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:40,700
So this is all about the PC universe of the game.

2228
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:45,020
Gazillion is saying that, uh, originally it was developed for consoles as well, but they

2229
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:48,860
are not confirming or denying if it's still coming to consoles at this time.

2230
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:50,340
Squirrel girl is awesome.

2231
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,260
Who is squirrel girl for the uninitiated?

2232
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:55,940
Squirrel girl, her mutant power is basically being an anthropomorphic squirrel and she

2233
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:57,140
can talk telepathically.

2234
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:59,420
She can talk to squirrels and understand their language.

2235
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:03,340
But the thing is, is that she's actually defeated Dr. Doom and Thanos, the real thing by the

2236
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:08,660
way, and all kinds of just bad guys and also kicked Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Avengers

2237
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:13,140
mansion and told him to shut his evil, evil pie hole.

2238
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:14,140
She's super fun.

2239
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:18,540
Actually, right now she's the babysitter, well, I guess nanny slash babysitter for Jessica

2240
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:19,540
Jones and Luke Cage's baby.

2241
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,540
The nanny.

2242
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:27,280
But I, Mr. Sheffield, I, you know, I like, I like some, some of the cheese ball characters

2243
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:30,020
and she's cheese ball, but actually cheese ball in a fun way.

2244
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:34,900
I want to have a character in Marvel universe that's the nanny as a superhero.

2245
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:41,060
There actually was a, was, um, a bad guy who was a nanny and orphan maker.

2246
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,500
Or super nanny.

2247
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,300
You've been very, very naughty.

2248
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,980
Now you need to go to the naughty corner.

2249
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,540
It was nanny and orphan maker.

2250
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:49,540
Okay.

2251
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:50,540
All right, let's move on.

2252
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,300
Yes, I know my obscure.

2253
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:55,460
Another tweet from Tiger Claw.

2254
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:59,180
This show, this show started off so well and then there's this stuff going on in the real

2255
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,740
world and now it's just, oh, who cares anymore?

2256
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:02,740
All right.

2257
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:04,760
A tweet, another tweet from Tiger Claw.

2258
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,020
It's about LA noir.

2259
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:09,860
Um, there'll be social, I guess there's a social club for this.

2260
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,860
Uh, what is this?

2261
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:11,860
Is this on Facebook or something?

2262
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:13,420
It's rockstar social club.

2263
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,420
It's it's a website thing that they have.

2264
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:17,020
It's tied in with all rockstar games.

2265
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,020
Okay.

2266
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:22,060
Well, if you get through the whole thing, you get a exclusive outfit for the game.

2267
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:24,380
So I guess it's an incentive to get in on that thing.

2268
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,900
If you're into that, if you're like, uh, if you're into the Barbie doll stuff in your

2269
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:27,900
video games.

2270
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:28,900
No, social club's pretty fun.

2271
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,940
They had a bunch of stuff with Grand Theft Auto like they did, uh, you know, they have

2272
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:37,340
the leaderboards for multiplayer, which I, you know, paid attention to a lot for a while.

2273
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:41,340
Um, they had things like the Grand Theft, it was a delivery city marathon where they

2274
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:46,540
tracked how long, how far you ran, how far you drove, you know, how many bullets you

2275
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:47,980
spent, that kind of stuff.

2276
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:51,100
So they do a bunch of different things and then also they do stuff with like Red Dead

2277
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:55,700
Redemption with, um, you know, they have little challenges that you do and you unlock skins

2278
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:57,860
and stuff like that through those challenges.

2279
01:53:57,860 --> 01:53:59,860
So that's kind of neat.

2280
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:03,900
Uh, yeah, the costume you're going to unlock on the social club, if you're a member, the

2281
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:08,900
Chicago lightning suit, it's for the protagonist, Cole Phillips, in the game.

2282
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:14,060
And if you're online, you get to access the ask the community feature in game.

2283
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,820
And if you're interrogating a suspect, you don't know if they're telling the truth or

2284
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:20,660
not, you can see how other players responded in the same situation.

2285
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:24,940
They're calling it a who wants to be a millionaire, ask the audience lifeline.

2286
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:25,940
That's kind of crazy.

2287
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:28,100
I like, I like that kind of idea for games though.

2288
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:33,300
Well, they had a thing come out, um, you know, about that game as well, where if you were

2289
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:39,820
having trouble in certain spots and whatnot, you could actually, um, bypass some of the

2290
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:42,060
action sequences in the game.

2291
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:46,140
So like if you keep failing over and over and over again, um, you can just skip past

2292
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:50,140
it and get back to the narrative stuff, which is kind of unique.

2293
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:56,180
All right, uh, let's move on with, uh, some more gaming news.

2294
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:59,780
That was it for Twitter topics tonight, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to talk to us throughout

2295
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,780
the week.

2296
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:01,780
Back to some other news.

2297
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,780
Loki.

2298
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:09,300
Uh, Gamasutra ran kind of a editorial about the whole PlayStation, you know, debacle,

2299
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:10,940
I guess, right now.

2300
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:16,060
Basically they were saying, you know, the PlayStation brand faces an uncertain future

2301
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:20,420
and they're worried that, you know, Sony's kind of, well, as we kind of put it before,

2302
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:22,140
not handling the situation correctly.

2303
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:25,340
Like for example, here's a little test for you.

2304
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:28,980
Which of the following statements are most likely, are you most likely to agree with

2305
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,900
in a one year's term?

2306
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,340
A, Sony handled the situation amazingly.

2307
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:36,500
They held up their hands and took appropriate share of the blame.

2308
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:40,600
They outlined a clear plan of action to remedy the situation and made sure that all stakeholders

2309
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:46,460
were recompensed beyond reasonable expectations.

2310
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:52,980
And they showed their human side and came out of this a stronger company.

2311
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,820
Or B, it just kind of went away, didn't it?

2312
01:55:55,820 --> 01:56:01,580
Sony entirely laid the blame on hackers, launched a lot of legal flak, refused to take any responsibility,

2313
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:07,160
offered minimum clarity and token recompense.

2314
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:11,780
That no one cares anymore, at least they've encrypted my personal data now.

2315
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:16,180
And of course, you know, most people probably agree with B.

2316
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:19,340
And even like, you know, they were saying like, you know, their response has been pretty

2317
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:20,340
pitiful.

2318
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:24,860
You know, the best they did was sent out an email and posted a post on their blog.

2319
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:32,020
I mean, if you even read it, they said, we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern

2320
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:33,500
this outage has caused.

2321
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,260
You know, they're saying this outage is like it's inclement weather.

2322
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,860
And they also said, we made a mistake here.

2323
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:40,860
We picked a fight.

2324
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:41,860
We couldn't win.

2325
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:44,420
Or no, they're saying they should have said, we made a mistake here.

2326
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:45,420
We picked a fight.

2327
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:46,420
We couldn't win.

2328
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:52,140
And even with TAC, highly likely, we neglected the protector stuff.

2329
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:58,060
So you know, what they're saying is they could handle this, you know, in a way that could

2330
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:03,340
kind of get people to trust them again, you know, just kind of showing their human side.

2331
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:07,180
But without it, you know, and it kind of like what we were going back to before with, you

2332
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:12,100
know, talking about Jack in the Box and, you know, that's something they mentioned JetBlue,

2333
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:15,820
for example, had, you know, kind of a debacle.

2334
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:23,940
And they ended up coming out of a better company because they spent time, effort to, you know,

2335
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:29,300
improve their customer service and, you know, in turn, they became a strong company.

2336
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:34,140
So Domino's Pizza, Toyota, you know, those are some of the brands that were kind of hard

2337
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:40,820
by, you know, a situation like this, but then they kind of turned it around with their,

2338
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:45,420
you know, dedication to, you know, kind of changing their ways.

2339
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:48,020
Sony so far have said, you know, here's some DLC.

2340
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:52,380
Oh yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to protect your data now.

2341
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,460
So I think they're kind of right.

2342
01:57:54,460 --> 01:58:00,100
I don't know, I think that PlayStation brand as far as trusting them with, you know, my

2343
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:08,420
information, maybe, maybe that's harmed a bit, but they're kind of stretching the PlayStation

2344
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:12,140
brand a little thin, if you ask me, especially with like tablet devices and stuff now.

2345
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:15,340
It's like, just because it plays PlayStation one games, I don't really know if you should

2346
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:17,700
call it like a PlayStation device.

2347
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,340
Uh, yeah.

2348
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:22,700
And you know, I, I hate to kind of beat a dead horse because we were talking about this

2349
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:26,540
in part A anyway, and it's kind of like, I really think Sony can recover from this despite

2350
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:30,500
what all the, uh, rampant angry gamer chat on the internet would make you think.

2351
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:34,380
Uh, but you know, it's like Microsoft recovered from the red ring of death thing and let's

2352
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:36,780
be real, that was a pretty serious thing that happened.

2353
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:41,180
But Nintendo recovered from, well, the virtual boy.

2354
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:46,380
So you know, companies can recover and they will, but they have to do the right thing.

2355
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:47,380
Yeah, exactly.

2356
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:49,060
Like being hard headed is not the right thing.

2357
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:53,420
And granted Microsoft, I think they never really came up, obviously they didn't come

2358
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:57,820
up front and say how many of their systems were affected by the red ring problem.

2359
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:58,820
Here's a hint.

2360
01:58:58,820 --> 01:59:00,640
It was all of them at launch.

2361
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:04,940
Every single one, every single one will die eventually.

2362
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:07,740
I know this, it will happen.

2363
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:08,900
Every single one.

2364
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:09,900
You'll be lucky.

2365
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:12,660
I would, I don't know.

2366
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:16,300
I would be very impressed to see a system that actually is one of their launch systems

2367
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:19,660
that's still working today, that's being rigorously played.

2368
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,780
I guarantee that there's less than like one percent.

2369
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:27,380
But anyways, let's be honest, they fixed it after multiple iterations and tweaks and stuff

2370
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:28,380
like that.

2371
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,740
Now their system is stable.

2372
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:33,100
It's not, you know, it's not dying.

2373
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:37,220
They improved their warranties and stuff, you know, three years and stuff and they covered

2374
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,700
replacements for a lot of it.

2375
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:42,380
So yeah, it sucked having to replace the system like a bunch of times and stuff.

2376
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:45,540
Apple and the iPhone 4, that's another big one too with the antenna gate.

2377
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:46,540
Remember that?

2378
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:47,540
Oh yeah.

2379
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:48,540
And they've recovered fine.

2380
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:51,180
iPads 2s are selling like crazy.

2381
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:58,940
But it's all about how you handle it, and I mean really, I'm sorry, not everyone reads

2382
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:00,800
the Playstation blog, okay?

2383
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,900
If you're looking at your average mom and pop users, say they have, you know, sign up

2384
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:08,420
on the Playstation network and they buy stuff through there, they're not reading the internet

2385
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:11,920
blogs, you know, and stuff, and yeah, okay, they get an email.

2386
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:17,500
So let's just say, for example, that they used an email with that service that maybe

2387
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,140
they don't use that quite regularly.

2388
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:23,860
So they would have absolutely no idea this is going on until they hear it from like a

2389
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:29,180
media outlet saying, oh yeah, Sony's just, you know, been hacked and all these people's

2390
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:32,980
credit information, you know, credit card information has been leaked out.

2391
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:33,980
Ah!

2392
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:35,840
That's not good.

2393
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:41,100
I mean you need to be telling your customers up front, or at least, you know, being a little

2394
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:45,900
bit more clear about it, put out a statement or something, you know, I know that they did

2395
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:52,500
the press conference thing, but I'm sorry though, you're just pointing blame, so.

2396
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:58,580
But we'll see, it'll be interesting, E3 I'm sure they're gonna mention something, I mean,

2397
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:02,860
obviously it's still gonna be fresh in everybody's mind.

2398
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:07,540
Alright well, obviously it's not just Sony with news in the world right now, Xbox, they

2399
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,100
had a pretty big thing come out this week.

2400
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:14,620
Hulu Plus actually just came out to the system, it was released on April 29th, and yeah, it

2401
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:18,580
was kind of fast, like the news came out during the week and then suddenly, whoo, bam, there's

2402
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,700
Hulu Plus.

2403
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:24,700
Now there is actually this whole sponsorship going on, and I apologize, I forgot the company

2404
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,900
that was sponsoring it, but it doesn't matter, they're not paying us.

2405
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:32,820
So some company is actually sponsoring a two week preview of Hulu Plus right now, and then

2406
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:36,700
I guess you can also get another one if you actually sign up through Hulu's website, and

2407
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:38,820
you get a two week trial there as well.

2408
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:42,980
So if you wanna try out Hulu Plus for like a month, you can do so.

2409
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:46,580
I have not signed up for it and probably I'm not going to, I think Hulu Plus is kind of

2410
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:50,100
a shitty idea, because I'm not a fan of the fact that there's still commercials and you're

2411
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:51,100
paying for it.

2412
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:55,540
Like honestly, I've got Netflix, it's got the shows I wanna see, otherwise if they don't

2413
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:57,380
have it, I'll just torrent it.

2414
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:02,300
Like I'm not, you know, not to come out and admit that I'm a bloody thief or whatever,

2415
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:07,020
but like I'd use Hulu if it was money or commercials, but not both.

2416
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:12,020
That's just ridiculous to me, make your money one way or the other.

2417
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:15,060
So yeah, I guess they have a lot of good stuff though.

2418
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:18,420
I mean the free Hulu online is kind of cool, I kind of wish you could do free Hulu through

2419
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:22,500
the Xbox, the ad supported, because you can watch like the entire run of Dark Shadows

2420
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:23,500
through Hulu.

2421
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:26,660
But you know what, Netflix just got Twin Peaks like a couple weeks ago, and seriously if

2422
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:28,360
you guys have never watched Twin Peaks, it's awesome.

2423
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:31,020
You can do Hulu through your Xbox.

2424
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,020
How?

2425
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:33,400
Diversity.

2426
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,400
You have to.

2427
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,400
Oh right.

2428
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:41,060
You can do diversity, you can watch your cues through pretty much any device that'll do

2429
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:42,060
streaming.

2430
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,820
I use my Playstation 3 for that.

2431
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:45,740
It actually works pretty well for that.

2432
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:50,700
Hulu doesn't look that great though because it's kind of low resolution, but we've watched

2433
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:53,820
a few episodes of The Office that we were missing when we were catching up, you know,

2434
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:59,900
all the seasons and stuff, but yeah, it does kind of suck that, now I know what they're

2435
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:03,560
saying, well you pay for cable and there's commercials there too, but yeah.

2436
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:11,820
But I, you know, I don't need you quite as much as I need, you know, other TV.

2437
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:12,820
I guess.

2438
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:16,140
It's like stop being greedy about it.

2439
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:19,580
Alright well let's move on with some more stories, Dark Sakura.

2440
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:26,300
Well in other news, we do have something for the 3DS, Excitebike 3D Classic is going to

2441
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:29,640
be offered on the 3DS for free!

2442
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:35,100
When the 3DS eShop goes live, this is going to be a part of it.

2443
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:44,140
And like I said, it's 3D Excitebike, so you get it in full lenticular motion, but they

2444
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:48,620
didn't say where it was going to be for, but it could possibly just be Japan.

2445
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:50,740
Here's what's kind of retarded.

2446
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:56,540
I don't know if anyone's actually seen a Japanese 3DS, I mean, I have, but in the beginning

2447
02:03:56,540 --> 02:04:01,100
of their, you know how we have this, you know, OK Go video, well they got this, you know,

2448
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:06,580
Mario live music performance thing over there as the free 3D video.

2449
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:12,300
And before that actually starts, they have a 3D picture of Super Mario Bros. 1.

2450
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:17,100
And the way they show that is exactly how they're doing this.

2451
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:21,140
Basically, you know, most of these 8-bit games have different sprite layers.

2452
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:22,140
That's all they're doing.

2453
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:24,100
Each sprite layer is a different depth.

2454
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:25,100
That is it.

2455
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:32,260
I was showing it at E3, Xevious was the old 8-bit game and the ground was one sprite layer

2456
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:36,300
and that was in the background and then all the other sprites were on top.

2457
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:37,900
It was a neat effect to see.

2458
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:41,860
I mean, it's cool, but I would not spend very much money.

2459
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:47,960
I mean, the game is going to have to be like a true NES classic that I just, I need to

2460
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,300
have on my DS.

2461
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:50,860
Like that's the only way I'm going to buy it again.

2462
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:51,860
But see, that's what they're doing.

2463
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:52,860
I got burned on the list.

2464
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:58,100
They're just, they have an emulator now, obviously, that works with these, I mean, come on, anything

2465
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:01,240
can run an NES emulator nowadays.

2466
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:09,140
So they have an NES emulator that just spreads out the sprite layers.

2467
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:11,880
When homebrew comes out, I'm sure someone will come up with that.

2468
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,880
It's not that complicated.

2469
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:14,880
But you know what they're going to do?

2470
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,620
They're going to charge you like 4 bucks for each one of those games because people will

2471
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:23,020
buy them, even though it's really not worth the effort that they put in to develop this

2472
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:24,020
emulator.

2473
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:29,660
It would be really nice if, like, they would just give us a kickback because we bought

2474
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:31,220
it on Wii Virtual Console.

2475
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:32,980
I mean, I know that's not going to happen.

2476
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:34,380
I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice?

2477
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,580
It would be nice, but they don't really, I mean, they have accounts that are tied to

2478
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:41,260
the Wii, but it's not an account that you can take everywhere.

2479
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:44,300
It's basically just an account that's tied to that console.

2480
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:49,700
You know, if they had an actual centralized online community or something like that, then

2481
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,060
yeah, something like that could happen.

2482
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:54,460
Well hey, I see they purchased Mario Brothers on the Wii.

2483
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,460
Guess what?

2484
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,460
You get the 3D version for free.

2485
02:05:56,460 --> 02:06:01,400
Which they really should do because it's like a few kilobytes worth of data.

2486
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:05,700
And yeah, I'm sure that emulator really took some time.

2487
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:08,500
You just probably ported the one from the Wii over to the DS.

2488
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:13,260
Oh fuck, I mean, people have been running NES emulators on the DS forever.

2489
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:16,620
I mean, all you'd have to do is just tweak the display so that each sprite layer is a

2490
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:18,380
different layer of 3D.

2491
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:21,540
I mean, that's not hard.

2492
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,540
It's not difficult.

2493
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:24,300
And it's very minimal.

2494
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:28,700
So yeah, that should be free.

2495
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:29,700
But it won't be.

2496
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:32,180
I mean, after all, how else are these things going to print money?

2497
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:33,180
Even just a discount.

2498
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:35,360
Even just like a little discount or something.

2499
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:39,700
Or maybe like if I get enough Nintendo achievements, I know, right?

2500
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:45,580
I could like get one for free, or like, you know, one or two upgrades.

2501
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:46,980
That's all they really should be charging for this stuff.

2502
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:48,980
Yeah, charge me $0.99.

2503
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:49,980
That'd be great.

2504
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:53,700
And if I don't own the game at all, then fine, charge me $5.99.

2505
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:56,180
Five what the game would have cost, and the extra $0.99 for the 3D.

2506
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:59,100
No, it should not even be $6 for an old NES game.

2507
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:02,280
I'm sorry, no.

2508
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:04,500
Some are worth it, but very few.

2509
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:08,240
Some are worth it.

2510
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,540
But at the same time, I mean, I can go buy the original on cartridge, but sometimes the

2511
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:13,660
original cartridges will cost you more than five bucks.

2512
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:15,620
Just depends on what game you're talking about.

2513
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:18,540
Seriously, especially if you're trying to fill up your Tangen collection.

2514
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:19,540
Yeah.

2515
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:21,540
Which, by the way, Afterburner is mentioned.

2516
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:25,940
And I have your Fantasy Zone, if you didn't know that.

2517
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:26,940
Yes, I do.

2518
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,940
Okay.

2519
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:28,940
Yeah, didn't I lend it to you?

2520
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:29,940
Yeah, you did.

2521
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:30,940
So, just so you know.

2522
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:31,940
Okay, cool.

2523
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:40,340
As I was mentioning, Afterburner, they did a Tangen one for NES, just thought I'd mention

2524
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:41,340
that.

2525
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:44,780
Comment in our chatroom on, from ToaGak, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo ripped off

2526
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:46,740
a homebrew emulator.

2527
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:48,140
Loki?

2528
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:53,100
Um, I don't think that they need to, because they've got an emulator for the Wii.

2529
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:54,380
They've got all the tech docs they need.

2530
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:59,500
They've got an emulator for a Wii, they had cartridges on the Game Boy Advance, or even

2531
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:05,980
I think the Game Boy Color, they had NES cartridges.

2532
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:09,420
So they've got, I mean, hell, they have an emulator that runs on the Game Boy.

2533
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:12,060
It's obviously gonna run on the 3DS.

2534
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:14,220
So they have that kind of data there.

2535
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:17,580
It's just minimal tweaking to get it to be in 3D.

2536
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:21,900
Seriously, it's not any special effects that they're adding or anything.

2537
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:25,780
I mean, if it was some Mode 7 games or something like that, that might be a little bit cooler

2538
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:33,900
if those were in 3D, because they had a lot of scaling there, but just doing, like, separating

2539
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:38,300
the sprite layers is, I'm sorry, it's like child's play stuff.

2540
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:42,860
It's just really, people are gonna find it neat, but once again, they're selling you

2541
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:43,960
on the gimmick.

2542
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:47,220
They're selling you on your memories of these retro games, because they're like, oh my god,

2543
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:51,300
Nintendo games, oh, it's in 3D now!

2544
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:57,300
Seriously, you're gonna buy into that, and you're just only encouraging them to spend

2545
02:08:57,300 --> 02:09:00,700
what little effort they will on this stuff.

2546
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:03,700
But hey, you know what, if that's what you want, then fine.

2547
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:06,820
Because they're not gonna change their ways anytime soon.

2548
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:10,600
So whatever, you know, buy what you want.

2549
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:12,500
It's my money, I'll spend it how I want.

2550
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,500
Yeah, pretty much.

2551
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:17,580
How much did you pay to import the Japanese 3DS again?

2552
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:18,580
I forgot.

2553
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:21,420
Could you remind me how much?

2554
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,580
I liked getting stuff early.

2555
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:24,580
I know, I'm just messing with you.

2556
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:25,580
And then I sold it.

2557
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:29,260
I'm just giving you shit, that is my role on the show, okay?

2558
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:33,020
Dark Soccer's role is to be the girl, your role is to be the tech master, and mine is

2559
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:34,540
to give the both of you shit.

2560
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:36,380
Yeah, but here's the thing.

2561
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:38,100
I'm not just a girl.

2562
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:41,300
Well, I was gonna say a bitch, but I thought that would be me.

2563
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:42,700
I know, that's awesome.

2564
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:48,020
I would almost consider selling that 3DS again, just to get rid of it, because I'm not playing

2565
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:49,740
anything on it, really, right now.

2566
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:53,340
And I have a feeling it's just gonna be collecting dust, like my DS is.

2567
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:57,300
And you know, I may just...

2568
02:09:57,300 --> 02:09:58,300
But what's the point?

2569
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:00,300
You know, because I'll probably want a game later on down the road.

2570
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:03,740
But you better be...

2571
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:09,060
And yeah, when the new Nintendo console comes out, I probably will have to buy it, because

2572
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:11,660
it'll be spiffy and new, and I like new things.

2573
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:17,660
But I will seriously think about it, I mean, because if they don't have some really awesome

2574
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:22,140
games at launch, then count me out.

2575
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:27,940
I'll wait until some future versions come out.

2576
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:32,380
I'm not gonna be so impulse-crazy nowadays, because it really doesn't get me anything.

2577
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,380
What?

2578
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:35,940
Oh, okay, I got to play Ridge Racer in 3D for a little bit.

2579
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:39,540
Yeah, that's cool, but I don't know.

2580
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:42,780
It's not that big of a deal.

2581
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:46,220
And it all really matters about the cost of that console, because man, that thing's like

2582
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:49,900
three hundred dollars plus a hundred dollars for the controller.

2583
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:52,540
Nope.

2584
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:53,540
Or maybe.

2585
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:57,980
Alright, let's move on with some, what, hacking news, right?

2586
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:01,860
Yeah, the PlayStation Network's not the only thing that's being hacked.

2587
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:08,380
Of course, there's kind of been a struggle between hackers creating custom firmwares

2588
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:14,820
for the drives of the consoles, and then of course Microsoft in updating those.

2589
02:11:14,820 --> 02:11:18,180
They have the new firmware that's gonna be coming out, or the new dashboard update that's

2590
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:25,860
gonna kind of tweak the disks as well as enabling what they call AP 2.5 on all the games.

2591
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:31,620
It's basically a new copy protection that they have right now on a couple of the Call

2592
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:36,700
of Duty games, and on Assassin's Creed and actually some of the newer games.

2593
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:39,980
Of course, all that stuff can be patched.

2594
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:45,020
But there's some interesting things coming out, and some of this almost similar to the

2595
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:46,420
PlayStation 3.

2596
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:53,460
For example, there is a device coming out called the Xbox, or the X360 key.

2597
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:57,780
It'll allow you to play any game from a USB drive.

2598
02:11:57,780 --> 02:12:02,940
And what it's basically gonna be, it's gonna be a device that connects in between your

2599
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:08,300
Xbox 360, the SATA connection that's on there, and the DVD drive.

2600
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:14,100
And it will allow it to emulate the actual DVD drive itself, so make it think that it's

2601
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:20,700
playing disks off the drive when it's actually playing ISOs off a USB drive or a hard drive.

2602
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:22,980
And actually the system has Linux running on it.

2603
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:26,060
It's fully upgradeable.

2604
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:33,400
And I guess it's gonna have protection against whatever the AP 25 protection emulation is

2605
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:35,480
well built in there.

2606
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:40,260
No word on when it's coming out yet, but I've seen initial costs on it, it's 120 bucks.

2607
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:43,260
So I guess we'll have to see if this actually works out and stuff.

2608
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:48,080
But if that's the case though, it will actually allow you to do all that without having to

2609
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:49,080
mod your system.

2610
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:52,860
Of course, you'll still have to open it up.

2611
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:58,180
And then of course, if that's not your way to go, the Commodore Forever, they announced

2612
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:05,260
that they're gonna have a new iXtreme LT firmware for all drives, including Commodore

2613
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:06,260
Forever.

2614
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:08,420
You're gonna be able to put Gios on your 360?

2615
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:09,540
No you're not.

2616
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:11,340
It's the hacking group, Commodore Forever.

2617
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:12,340
Play Last Ninja?

2618
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:16,020
They've been working on firmwares for the drives for a long time.

2619
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:21,900
They say their LT 2.0 supports the XG-D3, which is the new disk format that Microsoft's

2620
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:24,300
putting out to gain that extra one gig.

2621
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:32,300
And also the slim, light-on 0225 drive, which was unhackable as of right now.

2622
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:37,420
So apparently that will allow you to bypass all this different protection and allow you

2623
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:38,420
to flash your drives.

2624
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:41,180
And it's supposed to be untraceable as of right now.

2625
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:47,840
And I know the light touch stuff has been pretty stealthy as far as live goes, so that's

2626
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:48,840
kind of interesting.

2627
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:56,960
And the last thing was another device called Xbox 360 Optical Drive Emulation.

2628
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:04,620
And it's an emulator that will be a little bit similar to the 360 key, whereas a device

2629
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:12,740
set will make it look like it's running actual disks when it's running stuff off of a hard

2630
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:14,780
drive.

2631
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:15,780
Very interesting.

2632
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:22,980
A lot of this stuff can be patched out with one firmware update, but some of this, especially

2633
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:29,380
with the custom firmwares for the disk drives, it's back and forth with them.

2634
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:33,580
And actually the new firmware that's coming out, if you do have a flash device right now,

2635
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:37,460
what it's going to do is it's going to flash it back to stock, and then it's going to copy

2636
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:42,140
protect it, I guess, so that you can't adjust the firmware that's on your drive.

2637
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:46,540
So that's kind of interesting.

2638
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:51,100
So how long before we're emulating the actual Xbox 360, like on our PCs?

2639
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:57,460
A long time, because we're talking like multi-core processors and emulating that stuff.

2640
02:14:57,460 --> 02:15:02,300
It's going to take a long time before we're able to do that, a few years.

2641
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:04,220
All right.

2642
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:11,220
Well let's move on with some more gaming news, and this one has to do with the iPhone.

2643
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:16,900
And apparently, this is something I actually did a double take, and I was like, what is

2644
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:19,100
this being posted in our show roll thread for?

2645
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:21,460
Haven't we reported on this before?

2646
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:23,420
Well we have, but we haven't.

2647
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:27,620
And what I mean is, this is yet another game that has appeared on the iTunes app store

2648
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:30,220
that was copied off of a flash game.

2649
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:33,460
The game is called Achilles Defense.

2650
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:41,180
It was available on the iTunes store by, they're based in Hanoi, Vietnam, PTT Solution.

2651
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:45,780
It is a ripoff of Ironhide's Clash of the Olympians, Ironhide Game Studio, excuse me,

2652
02:15:45,780 --> 02:15:48,060
Clash of the Olympians.

2653
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:53,020
The only difference is, Ironhide's game has three characters, PTT's app has one.

2654
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:57,340
The music, the artwork, the gameplay, it is all the same.

2655
02:15:57,340 --> 02:15:59,860
Clash of the Olympians came out in August of last year.

2656
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:03,420
You can play that online at ironhidegames.com.

2657
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,940
Achilles Defense came out on April 18th.

2658
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:11,300
It was offered for free, and now it's down to, I'm sorry, up to a 99% price.

2659
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:17,140
Of course, some people are review spamming that, but needless to say, it's there.

2660
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,740
It's been on the app store.

2661
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:20,700
How does Apple prevent this?

2662
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:24,820
I mean, because they don't really screen the content of games.

2663
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:25,820
I don't know.

2664
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:28,940
Like, obviously this news is very sad to that development company who, you know, had the

2665
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:30,420
game out there for free that somebody totally ripped off.

2666
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:32,100
Did you see the Mario ripoff on there too?

2667
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,980
Yeah, I mean, that was the other, I think, thing that had come out before.

2668
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:41,640
There's a Mario ripoff, and then there was that other game too that had come out, so.

2669
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:46,300
The blocks cometh, and then there was also some bunny game, bunny fighting game.

2670
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:49,580
That was less of a ripoff and more of, like, a rights issue.

2671
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:53,300
Who owned the rights to it and stuff, but the other one was a complete ripoff.

2672
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:59,980
For the record, Ironhide is pissed, and they wrote Apple to complain, and they want gamers

2673
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:04,060
to help assist them by lodging their own complaints in the game's comment space.

2674
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:06,500
So they're encouraging people to downvote this thing.

2675
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:11,020
Now it is the weekend, so I don't know what's gonna happen, but come Monday I'm sure it's,

2676
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:14,060
you know, gonna get crazy.

2677
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:18,100
And maybe Apple will pull it down, I don't know.

2678
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:19,100
So.

2679
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:20,100
Alright.

2680
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:21,100
Anyhow.

2681
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:24,580
Uh, let's move on to the mailbag.

2682
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:27,340
Oh, and boy, we've got a fun one this week.

2683
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:31,700
Because Dark Soccer got a taco before the show started, and she was only getting that

2684
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:33,140
taco if we got ten emails.

2685
02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:34,140
But you got more than that.

2686
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:35,140
You got more than that.

2687
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,500
Now, I don't know if she's reading every single one.

2688
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:38,580
I'm doubting that, right?

2689
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:39,580
No, I'm not.

2690
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:45,500
Pretty much anything that's repeating the emails that Sony sent out for PSN, and our

2691
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:48,540
rehashes of things we've already discussed, I'm not reading them.

2692
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:50,940
Let me give you a super tip if you want to email the show.

2693
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:53,820
Remember, the show is about where every gamer has a voice.

2694
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:57,220
And sometimes people want to email us to clue us into news and things that are going on,

2695
02:17:57,220 --> 02:18:00,620
which is fine, especially because sometimes we miss those things, they fall off the radar,

2696
02:18:00,620 --> 02:18:04,660
like the case of the Marvel Universe thing earlier in the show, and Tigerclaw got that

2697
02:18:04,660 --> 02:18:05,920
to our attention via Twitter.

2698
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:10,180
But if everybody's talking about it, like the PSN thing, we're probably going to cover

2699
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:11,520
it in the show.

2700
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:14,220
We want to know your thoughts.

2701
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:15,700
Don't just regurgitate the news.

2702
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:17,020
Tell us what you think.

2703
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:21,700
A better email will tell us about what you plan to do because of the Sony hack, which

2704
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:23,940
I imagine we're going to get to in some of these emails.

2705
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:27,660
Some of them were that they were also repeat emailers, and I'm trying to give new people

2706
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:28,660
attention too.

2707
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:29,660
Sure.

2708
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:30,660
Absolutely.

2709
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:31,660
Absolutely.

2710
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:32,660
As it is.

2711
02:18:32,660 --> 02:18:35,340
If you've had a lot of emails, if your voice has been heard a lot, don't be butthurt that

2712
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:36,900
we do some other people tonight.

2713
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:39,220
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2714
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:40,220
I'm reading eleven of them.

2715
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:41,220
Oh shit.

2716
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:42,220
All right.

2717
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:43,220
Well, here we go then.

2718
02:18:43,220 --> 02:18:44,220
Okay.

2719
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,220
This one.

2720
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:46,220
It's taco time.

2721
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:49,980
Join our valiant chef, Dark Sakura, on her quest to defeat the evil Montezuma and his

2722
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:50,980
army of veggies.

2723
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:55,180
Will our hero be able to stop a digestive disaster and create the perfect taco?

2724
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:56,340
With your help she can.

2725
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:57,460
Only for Xbox 360.

2726
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:00,300
Pre-order today and receive an official taco time salsa spoon.

2727
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:01,300
All right.

2728
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:02,940
I know this has been terribly lame, but I couldn't resist.

2729
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:05,860
I hope you at least get a chuckle out of this.

2730
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:08,620
I've been a long time listener, but this is my first time writing in.

2731
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:13,020
You guys helped me survive my boring job, so keep up the gaming news and crazy tangents.

2732
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:14,540
Feed Jamie tacos now.

2733
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:15,540
That's from Panaxium.

2734
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:16,540
Fine.

2735
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:17,540
We fed her.

2736
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:18,540
And he sent me a picture.

2737
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:19,820
Be quiet.

2738
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:20,820
Taco time.

2739
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:21,820
Oh, this is great.

2740
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,080
Oh, that's awesome.

2741
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:27,700
They actually put your picture in the little chef's hat on taco time.

2742
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:29,660
This is actually a pretty decent photo shopping.

2743
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:30,660
I'm saving it.

2744
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:33,220
This is the orange launch radio website thingy.

2745
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:36,460
We have the super secret email now, so we stopped getting the goatee pictures.

2746
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:37,460
I'll let you do that, Rob.

2747
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:38,460
Well, I don't.

2748
02:19:38,460 --> 02:19:39,460
All right.

2749
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:40,460
Fine.

2750
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,460
I'll look it up.

2751
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,460
I'll take care of it.

2752
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:43,460
Forward it to me so I do it.

2753
02:19:43,460 --> 02:19:44,460
Okay.

2754
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:45,460
I'll take care of it later.

2755
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:46,460
Don't worry.

2756
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:47,460
I downloaded it.

2757
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:48,460
Okay.

2758
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,460
This one.

2759
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:51,940
Dear OLR, it's been a while since I last emailed you guys.

2760
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:53,100
I also miss listening live.

2761
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:55,100
I really need to get back into the habit of doing that.

2762
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:56,100
Yes, you do.

2763
02:19:56,100 --> 02:20:00,980
Anyways, I just got through with changing pretty much all of my passwords on multiple

2764
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:06,420
sites as well as notifying my bank of the PSN intrusion compromising my account.

2765
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:09,100
Honestly, this has been a huge wakeup call for me.

2766
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:13,420
Never before have I been this concerned about my personal information on the internet.

2767
02:20:13,420 --> 02:20:17,440
Sony's failure to protect my privacy and resolve this issue as quickly as possible really has

2768
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:21,420
me thinking twice about my future purchases on the PSN.

2769
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:25,380
I have heard of PSN cards like you buy in the stores, sort of like the Xbox Live or

2770
02:20:25,380 --> 02:20:26,700
iTunes cards.

2771
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:29,380
That seems like a safer route to go.

2772
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:33,860
On a lighter note, have any of you checked out Sonic Colors for the Wii?

2773
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:37,500
Before Sonic Generations comes out, I highly recommend that you don't miss out on this

2774
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:38,500
game.

2775
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:41,620
Actually, that's the one I was wanting to get, but we loaned out our Wii.

2776
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:42,620
It's really a lot of fun.

2777
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:43,620
Great soundtrack as well.

2778
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:47,580
Sega focused a lot more on the game design and gameplay rather than story this time around.

2779
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:53,540
But I have no issue there other than rolling my eyes at some of the cheesy lines in the

2780
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,540
cut scenes.

2781
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:55,540
So that's all for now.

2782
02:20:55,540 --> 02:20:56,540
Thanks for reading Ospher.

2783
02:20:56,540 --> 02:21:00,180
P.S. how about that Xbox 360 OLR autographed faceplate?

2784
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:01,180
Ah, fuck.

2785
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:04,380
You know, I just actually found a bunch of faceplates.

2786
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:06,560
So, okay.

2787
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:11,740
I'm going to email you back with my real email so that you can email me and we'll work on

2788
02:21:11,740 --> 02:21:12,740
it, okay?

2789
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:15,740
Hello there, OrangeLones Radio.

2790
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:20,140
I feel compelled to take the time out of my busy night to write you, I said busy, I meant

2791
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:24,900
busy, night to write you this email as the three of you on occasion entertain the masses.

2792
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:30,460
I found your show while being very bored at work on Stitcher today because at 1330 hours

2793
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:35,060
I was actually going through the mini podcast and I found yours to be the most enjoyable.

2794
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:38,580
To be honest, I never really listened to any type of podcast.

2795
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:43,040
I was bored of my music mixes on my Blackberry and wanted to hear people talk about topics

2796
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,140
I enjoy.

2797
02:21:44,140 --> 02:21:48,780
And yes, after listening I was heavily informed about what's what in gaming and not to mention

2798
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:50,980
walked away with a craving of tacos.

2799
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:54,820
I will be subscribing via iTunes but sadly not too many of my friends are gamers so I

2800
02:21:54,820 --> 02:22:00,420
don't really have anyone to tell as I work executive protection and the three friends

2801
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:03,340
I would rather talk about weapon calibers.

2802
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:08,540
But I will be trying to tune in while you are live on Sundays from now on so thanks

2803
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:09,540
for the great podcast.

2804
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:12,640
I love it and I found something new to look forward to at the end of the week.

2805
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:13,640
Thank you all.

2806
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:14,640
Shattered Hawk.

2807
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:15,640
P.S.

2808
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:16,840
DarkSark, if you like tacos you should try Navajo tacos.

2809
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:22,260
Your head will explode from the pure deliciousness of this dish.

2810
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:24,380
Well if I can find them.

2811
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:25,380
Sounds good.

2812
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,380
I love tacos.

2813
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,380
Is that a chain or is that a type of taco?

2814
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:28,700
I don't know.

2815
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:29,700
We need more.

2816
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:32,860
We need either a recipe or we need a FedEx box to show up at the house.

2817
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:33,860
More info.

2818
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:34,860
Give us the 411.

2819
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:36,580
Ah, you see what I did there.

2820
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:38,580
I'm clever.

2821
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:39,580
Nice.

2822
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:41,060
Okay.

2823
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:47,080
I was wondering regarding the PSN hack slash outage, hack slash, if the possible phishing

2824
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:54,060
email I wrote about at the end of May had anything in relation to the intrusion.

2825
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:58,820
The email did seem upon reflection fairly legitimate with no questions or warnings that

2826
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:02,980
you had to click through the link which I left untouched to enter personal information.

2827
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:05,780
Only the address it was sent from seemed suspect.

2828
02:23:05,780 --> 02:23:11,420
Secondly I noticed the latest issue of Games Magazine July 2011 has a feature story on

2829
02:23:11,420 --> 02:23:15,820
the selling of harmonics and the suspension of Guitar Hero as well as the reviewers take

2830
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:18,340
on the Dead Space 2 ad controversy.

2831
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:22,860
This is of course months old news, but to be fair, Games is not intended as a video

2832
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:23,860
game news source.

2833
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:28,800
It is first and foremost a magazine of crossword and logic puzzles with articles about board

2834
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,620
games and within the last decade or so of video games as well with issues likely being

2835
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:35,460
put together months before being published.

2836
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:37,900
July issue arriving in late April.

2837
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:43,180
I enjoy games for what it is, but wonder about your take on the ultra casual gaming press.

2838
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:50,460
And this comes from Robert M. Um, I don't really pay attention to it so, I don't know.

2839
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:57,220
I finally stopped getting a lot of those news release emails, Zynga farted.

2840
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,860
You know, that type of thing.

2841
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:00,540
I kind of don't care.

2842
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:02,900
I mean, if I want to play-

2843
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:08,220
It's so hard because I don't read a lot of that stuff, you know, and sometimes we're

2844
02:24:08,220 --> 02:24:09,220
challenged with that.

2845
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:11,420
We have to put ourselves in other people's shoes.

2846
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:18,660
I always find it fascinating to kind of see how, not so much maybe the casual gaming press

2847
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:21,740
or whatever, but like the mass media quote unquote reports on gaming.

2848
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:26,400
Like there was a local channel here that reported on the whole PlayStation Network breach because

2849
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,620
it was the top story on the day that it happened.

2850
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:34,340
It let off the 11 o'clock news and they twisted it to turn into a parents need to be monitoring

2851
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:39,140
what their children do type of story, which yes, I understand they should, but it seemed

2852
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:41,620
like, I don't know, it got a little preachy to me.

2853
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:42,940
Like it wasn't really about the hack.

2854
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:46,960
It was more about parents watch what your kids do because these consoles in your living

2855
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,460
room are stealing credit cards when you're not looking.

2856
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:53,860
And I just felt like it didn't really represent the story, but I expect no less from the mass

2857
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:54,860
media.

2858
02:24:54,860 --> 02:24:56,420
You know what I mean?

2859
02:24:56,420 --> 02:25:02,200
So I guess that's my unsolicited take on it.

2860
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:06,500
By the way, completely random aside, but it totally ties into this email.

2861
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:14,380
I did get a last minute story submission and it has to do with speaking of kind of casual

2862
02:25:14,380 --> 02:25:15,460
game news sites.

2863
02:25:15,460 --> 02:25:16,460
I don't know.

2864
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:19,420
I don't really consider, especially after something that happened this week.

2865
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:21,300
I don't want to get into the details of it.

2866
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:22,300
Follow me on Twitter.

2867
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:23,680
There's my plug.

2868
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:25,180
There's more on it there.

2869
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:29,800
But a certain website and UGO, I'll tell you, a big gaming website that I like to say this

2870
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:34,300
week stands for Ignorant Gaming News, is merging with UGO apparently.

2871
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:35,940
That's Depurr Report.

2872
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:39,100
And it's going to spin off from Newscore.

2873
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:40,100
Yeah.

2874
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:45,180
So I guess they're going to merge and continue to publish worthless stories.

2875
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:47,700
Okay.

2876
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:50,180
So is it my turn?

2877
02:25:50,180 --> 02:25:51,180
Yes.

2878
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:52,180
Sorry.

2879
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:53,180
Okay.

2880
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:54,180
Hello.

2881
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:57,060
I'm not going to read your first email, first or second email, but I'm going to tell you

2882
02:25:57,060 --> 02:26:01,740
if you are going to pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

2883
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:02,900
Apostrophes are for possessives.

2884
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:03,900
The end.

2885
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:04,900
Okay.

2886
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:05,900
Now I'll read it.

2887
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:06,900
Hello all.

2888
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:07,900
First of all, I have to say I'm loving the show.

2889
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:12,540
Second, I want to hear, I want to get Jamie her taco, so I thought I should write to you

2890
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:13,540
guys.

2891
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:14,540
My taco was delicious.

2892
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:15,540
Thank you.

2893
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:16,540
Here's my question.

2894
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,020
I'm a hardcore MMO player.

2895
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:22,680
Blizzard has its firm grasp on my wallet for six years and I've recently dabbled a bit

2896
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:24,820
in playing Rift alongside WoW.

2897
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:28,420
The thing is, I think Rift made me want to play WoW again, and I always wondered why

2898
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:29,420
that was.

2899
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:30,420
Any ideas?

2900
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:33,420
Maybe because it made you really appreciate World of Warcraft?

2901
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:34,420
Maybe?

2902
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:37,180
Also, there are lots of new MMOs being released.

2903
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:41,340
Terra Online, which I like to call Chicks with Gigantic Boobs MMO.

2904
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:43,020
The Old Republic and The Secret World.

2905
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:44,020
Do I want to play them?

2906
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:45,020
Yes.

2907
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:47,780
I actually want to play all of them, but I know most will probably disappoint me.

2908
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:51,580
In reality, I'll probably just stick with the two MMOs, but yes, here's my real question.

2909
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:54,980
Finally, do you think it's possible to juggle two MMOs at the same time?

2910
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:58,620
Keep up the good show, and I hope that you get your tacos, Jamie.

2911
02:26:58,620 --> 02:26:59,620
Love, Cyl.

2912
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:02,020
Hey, it was our guest from Hoard House this week.

2913
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:03,020
Yes.

2914
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:04,300
You know what?

2915
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:06,300
I feel bad now correcting.

2916
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,300
You bitch.

2917
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:09,020
No, I'm just kidding.

2918
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:10,900
See, I said that was your role on the show.

2919
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:12,420
But I do that to everybody.

2920
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:13,420
So, much love.

2921
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:14,420
Okay.

2922
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:19,980
So, first of all, I actually want to go back and play Star Trek Online while I'm playing

2923
02:27:19,980 --> 02:27:22,260
well, but I can't afford the two together right now.

2924
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:27,900
That's the hardest thing, is that trying to pay for two is usually the hardest thing to

2925
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:28,900
play two.

2926
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:34,040
I've seen a lot of people juggle a freemium in a premium, especially like Guild Wars types

2927
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,040
of things.

2928
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,040
That gets juggled a lot.

2929
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:40,620
Facebook games, if you think about it to some extent, are MMOs, kind of, I don't know.

2930
02:27:40,620 --> 02:27:42,380
So can you?

2931
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:43,380
Of course you can.

2932
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:46,180
There's lots of people that play two MMOs at once.

2933
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:50,260
When I was on Star Trek Online, I played Ragnarok Online on a free server.

2934
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:53,420
So I was keeping up with two MMOs, no problem.

2935
02:27:53,420 --> 02:27:56,300
I mean, most of the time it was just, oh, which one are my friends hanging out on?

2936
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:57,620
Well, I'll go play this one right now.

2937
02:27:57,620 --> 02:28:01,300
Okay, well, my guild's all asleep because I'm in America and they're not.

2938
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:08,180
So I suppose a lot of it just kind of depends too on how casual or hardcore are you into

2939
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:09,180
the games.

2940
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:12,620
Like, if you're hardcore into WoW, you don't have time for a lot else.

2941
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:17,940
If you're raiding several nights a week for several hours at a time, you're probably lucky

2942
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:20,220
if you're fitting in console games in your downtime.

2943
02:28:20,220 --> 02:28:24,660
You know, you can't, your life can't be filled with video games 24-7 and I think, you know,

2944
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:27,660
obviously the stuff from earlier tonight kind of proves that.

2945
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:31,340
There's a whole real world out there with news and everything.

2946
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:37,180
You know, so, but if you're more of the casual type, you don't really tie yourself down to

2947
02:28:37,180 --> 02:28:38,180
the games.

2948
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:42,140
You get to play on kind of like an as-you-want basis, absolutely there's room for two.

2949
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:43,140
Why not?

2950
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:48,460
Hell, some people invested like, what, a hundred hours plus into a game like Oblivion.

2951
02:28:48,460 --> 02:28:50,900
That's almost as big of an investment as an MMO.

2952
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:55,700
Well, it's, I'll tell you what's kind of hard is I've been playing Portal 2 and WoW together.

2953
02:28:55,700 --> 02:29:00,300
I mean, not at, clearly not at the same time, but I mean, both are time consuming, it really

2954
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:01,300
just depends.

2955
02:29:01,300 --> 02:29:02,300
Next email.

2956
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:07,340
Hey y'all, I was listening to OLR about the PSN network going down and the guy who was

2957
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:10,500
writing in thought that Anonymous did it.

2958
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:13,860
I personally don't think it was them because they said they had realized it wouldn't hurt

2959
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:17,620
the people they were trying to stand up for, which is a point that I made.

2960
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:21,500
It sounds to me like someone heard that Anonymous was doing this and decided to take advantage

2961
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,420
of having an obvious patsy and cover their own tracks.

2962
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:29,140
These guys seem to focus mainly on taking down websites and I've never heard of Anonymous

2963
02:29:29,140 --> 02:29:31,020
actually stealing stuff.

2964
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:35,240
I mean, I guess it's possible, but it just doesn't sound right.

2965
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:39,860
These are the same people who defended that Casey Heinz kid who was bullied.

2966
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:41,860
They sound like well-meaning folk.

2967
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:43,740
It just doesn't seem like them to me.

2968
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:47,500
Also about the hacking emails, I got one from Best Buy 2 saying that their email list had

2969
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:48,580
been stolen.

2970
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:50,900
It just seems to be going around right now and that's from Holly D.

2971
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:55,740
Wow, that's another Hoard House listener I recognize.

2972
02:29:55,740 --> 02:29:59,040
Yeah, I don't know.

2973
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:03,380
It's going to be interesting to see, especially with so many people involved, what the effect

2974
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:07,780
on the hackers could be because at the end of the day, the hackers are the ones to blame,

2975
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:08,780
right?

2976
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:09,780
Yeah.

2977
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:13,940
Although Sony does share their part in the accountability.

2978
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:14,940
Yes.

2979
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:16,740
They had...

2980
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:20,460
Sony needs to show what they're really doing to stop the hackers other than, well, our

2981
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:24,040
system is hack proof, inviting them in the front door, you know?

2982
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:26,980
Don't talk out of your ass.

2983
02:30:26,980 --> 02:30:28,940
Okay.

2984
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:33,100
If any, please answer in comments or e- what the hell is this?

2985
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:36,100
Oh no, this is crap email.

2986
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:37,100
Sorry.

2987
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:38,100
Oh, is it spam?

2988
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:39,100
Yeah.

2989
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:44,020
Oh, we have one from Anime Jam Session podcast crew, which would be our buddy Ranma.

2990
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:45,020
Skip it.

2991
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:46,020
I'm just kidding.

2992
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:47,020
I'm kidding.

2993
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:50,140
Greetings one and all, DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session here.

2994
02:30:50,140 --> 02:30:53,820
In between downtime and edits for the site and podcasting and everything else, I have

2995
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:55,340
found time to send an email.

2996
02:30:55,340 --> 02:30:58,420
I do have something to discuss and I will get straight to the point.

2997
02:30:58,420 --> 02:31:03,500
Rob, you squeaked with delight over the revival of the Commodore 64 and Loki thought it was

2998
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:04,500
crazy.

2999
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:05,500
I do have your back on this.

3000
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:11,740
I grew up with the C64, but instead of Tandy, Radio Shack, TRS-80, MC-10, and Color Computer

3001
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:12,740
3 for me.

3002
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:14,980
I had one of those too.

3003
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:18,100
From reading the specs and design build of it, I can justify the cost, especially the

3004
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:19,100
ultimate.

3005
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:23,100
I can tell you right now that the parts alone would run about $300 to $350 and probably

3006
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:27,020
another $200 for the case itself, since it's going to be made from the original materials,

3007
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:30,420
not the soft, cheap plastic crap, so Loki, stop hatin'.

3008
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:31,420
That's it.

3009
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:32,420
Time for me to get back to work here.

3010
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,820
The monkeys are flinging their poo at me, duck.

3011
02:31:34,820 --> 02:31:35,940
Take care and stay black.

3012
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:37,860
Okay, now the joke is officially dead.

3013
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:41,820
This email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, a podcast dedicated to anime cons,

3014
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:44,580
conventions, pop culture, and everything in between.

3015
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:47,220
Guaranteed podcasts, derailing, or your money back.

3016
02:31:47,220 --> 02:31:50,380
Check it out at www.animeshamsession.com.

3017
02:31:50,380 --> 02:31:51,380
Also on iTunes.

3018
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:52,540
Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.

3019
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:55,860
Could you read that part again that says, to Loki, stop hating?

3020
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:57,840
Stop hatin'!

3021
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,880
That's why he's on the show, is to hate.

3022
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:03,240
He's our resident hater.

3023
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:04,940
Hopefully he's playing Portal right now.

3024
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:06,580
Yeah, well, Portal sucks.

3025
02:32:06,580 --> 02:32:07,820
Oh wait, no it doesn't.

3026
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:08,820
I got nothin'.

3027
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:13,140
Hey, O.L.R. crew, long time podcast listener, first time writer.

3028
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:16,600
There have been many times that I have almost written in to comment on this, but never really

3029
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:18,220
felt compelled to until now.

3030
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:19,580
My reason for writing is twofold.

3031
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:21,980
One, most importantly, free tacos for Dark Sakura.

3032
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:23,700
I love you.

3033
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:26,180
Hopefully this email will get to that magic number ten.

3034
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:28,180
You're up there on the list.

3035
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:29,780
Two, Rob, please say it loud the following.

3036
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:30,780
Okay, ready?

3037
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:33,740
Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery.

3038
02:32:33,740 --> 02:32:37,060
Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery and give half to Rob.

3039
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:40,860
I'm requesting this because obviously Rob is a prophet given his prediction of the PSN

3040
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:43,540
outage being a bigger deal than initially reported.

3041
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:45,500
I was listening to the podcast last week.

3042
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:49,620
On the same day, Sony said, oh, and by the way, you know all that sensitive data we made

3043
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:52,260
you give us to play our games and use our services?

3044
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:56,700
Yeah, we just put a Furby on guard to watch security, and I guess the battery just ran

3045
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:57,700
out.

3046
02:32:57,700 --> 02:33:03,700
So, normally if anything was up, that little sumbitch would, that little sumbitch would

3047
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:10,980
start talking all kinds of crazy stuff like, mew, wow.

3048
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:13,420
But don't worry, everyone, we're going to put in a new battery.

3049
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:18,660
In the meantime, just watch all your credit card info and change all your passwords.

3050
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:19,660
We cool, dog?

3051
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:21,240
Yeah, we cool.

3052
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:25,380
I'm sure this topic has been beaten into the ground, so you can leave it at that.

3053
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:27,560
Beards Whiskey and Rock and Roll, Beardy McWhiskey.

3054
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:28,560
I like Beardy McWhiskey.

3055
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,560
Is he Canadian?

3056
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:34,820
I don't know, but I want him to send me some whiskey and send me the good stuff.

3057
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:35,820
Send me the beard.

3058
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:36,820
Just kidding.

3059
02:33:36,820 --> 02:33:40,140
You would not be able to, Alan can rock the beard.

3060
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:41,140
Alan can rock the beard.

3061
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:42,140
I don't think you can rock the beard.

3062
02:33:42,140 --> 02:33:43,140
No, I can't rock the beard.

3063
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:44,140
You've got that baby face.

3064
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:45,140
Aw.

3065
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:46,140
Aw.

3066
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:49,340
Then again, I didn't think Dan could rock a beard, but now he's got the goatee of doom.

3067
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:50,340
You don't know.

3068
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:53,340
One of these days I'm just going to shave my head and then I'll have the beard and we'll

3069
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:54,340
see what happens.

3070
02:33:54,340 --> 02:33:55,340
That's too lumpy.

3071
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:57,900
But I'm not going to have a choice soon enough.

3072
02:33:57,900 --> 02:34:00,460
You could totally pull a Shatner and get, like, the fake toupee.

3073
02:34:00,460 --> 02:34:01,460
No, I'm not.

3074
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:02,460
We'll get you a Tribble!

3075
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:03,460
In hell.

3076
02:34:03,460 --> 02:34:07,740
And then we can pop you on the head and go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

3077
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:09,720
Rob Hearts.

3078
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:10,720
Next email.

3079
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:11,720
Okay.

3080
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:12,720
Hi O.L.R.

3081
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:13,720
It's spaznator again.

3082
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:16,460
Yes, spaznator was one of the ones who sent me the big email from Sony, but this is the

3083
02:34:16,460 --> 02:34:18,440
part of it that I'm going to read.

3084
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:19,440
Hi O.L.R.

3085
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:20,440
It's spaznator again.

3086
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:23,660
Sorry for the second email, but I have a question for you regarding the PSN press release from

3087
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:24,660
4.30.

3088
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:28,660
The wording in one section has me a little confused. It states as follows.

3089
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:36,660
The company also expedited an already planned move of the system to a new data center in a different location that has been under construction and development for several months.

3090
02:34:36,660 --> 02:34:46,660
In addition, PS3 will have a forced system software update that will require all registered PlayStation Network users to change their account passwords before being able to sign into the service.

3091
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:58,660
As an added layer of security, the passwords can only be changed on the same PS3 in which that account was activated or through validated email confirmation, a critical step to further protect customer data.

3092
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:11,660
When they say that the password can only be changed on the same PS3 in which the account was activated, do they mean the PS3 which you initially created the account or if you for the sake of this email are on your fourth PS3 and had previously successfully activated your account for the current PS3?

3093
02:35:11,660 --> 02:35:23,660
Nope, the original one, but you'll be able to do it through email as well. If your original one died or whatever, you replaced it with a slim, whatever you did, you're not screwed as long as you can still log into the email account that you use for PlayStation Network.

3094
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:34,660
I ask this because I have two PSN accounts, spasnator and movie underscore profile, and neither account were initially created on my current PS3 although I've had these profiles on my PS3 since Sony sent it to me.

3095
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:46,660
With one profile, the email address is current, up to date, and easily accessible, but for the other, I still have the old Final Fantasy XI slash POL, I guess that's Play Online, email address associated with it.

3096
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:54,660
And I haven't used that in a couple of years. See, I'm both confused and concerned. Could you please enlighten me on this issue? Thank you in advance.

3097
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:58,660
I think you can actually still get into your Play Online email. You should be able to.

3098
02:35:58,660 --> 02:36:07,660
Sony SOE was not affected. They went down for a little bit, but their information was fine, and that would include Play Online.

3099
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:20,660
Okay, well, we're almost done. Another one from Robert M. From what footage I've seen of Portal 2, how would you say it's fair to compare the ambiance to that of Bioshock? Haven't played either yet, but hope too soon.

3100
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:25,660
Bioshock is a little bit more doom and gloom, ominous?

3101
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:30,660
Bioshock strikes me as a little more steampunk, whereas Portal's just a little more...

3102
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:35,660
And it's a little bit more on the psychological horror. But Portal is the...

3103
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:39,660
It's definitely like Science Lab from old to new. I don't know how else to describe it.

3104
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:41,660
With that quirky humor.

3105
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:46,660
Bioshock, you know, keep in mind there's blood in Bioshock, and there's not in Portal, and it really does make a difference.

3106
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:48,660
Portal is really more of a puzzle game.

3107
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:51,660
Yes, you can die in Portal, but you don't die in, like, gruesome ways.

3108
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:53,660
No, more like you drown or get shot.

3109
02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:54,660
Yeah.

3110
02:36:54,660 --> 02:37:03,660
And if you think about it, Mario only, you know, he dies from drowning in water or falling off a cliff, you know.

3111
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:08,660
Characters die in games, but sometimes it's violent and sometimes it's not. So...

3112
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:10,660
That is finally it!

3113
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:12,660
That's it?

3114
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:13,660
Yarp.

3115
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:14,660
Alrighty.

3116
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:15,660
I read 11 emails.

3117
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:21,660
Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com. Send us more emails, give us things to talk about.

3118
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:26,660
Sorry, no food incentive for next week, but we'll think of something in the future. Maybe we'll have a special week.

3119
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:30,660
But this time, Darsaka's buying me something, okay? That's all I'm saying.

3120
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:36,660
I want tacos. I want Pinkberry. Send 10 emails so I can get Pinkberry. That's what I want.

3121
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:40,660
Of course, everybody knows tacos, but not everybody understands Pinkberry.

3122
02:37:40,660 --> 02:37:43,660
Pinkberry's... Oh, wait, we got one last minute email.

3123
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:45,660
And it's short, so I'll read it.

3124
02:37:45,660 --> 02:37:46,660
Okay, fine.

3125
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:52,660
Hey guys, I just wanted to chime in so Jamie could get some tacos. I did not get tacos. I got taco, but it was a big taco.

3126
02:37:52,660 --> 02:37:56,660
That was her request, too. I asked her what she wanted and she said she wants a fish taco.

3127
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:57,660
Yes.

3128
02:37:57,660 --> 02:37:58,660
Heh heh heh heh.

3129
02:37:58,660 --> 02:38:00,660
Fish tacos are great.

3130
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:01,660
Heh heh heh heh.

3131
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:09,660
What is likely one of the main console developers would cease to exist and what is the likelihood new console developers could enter the market?

3132
02:38:09,660 --> 02:38:15,660
Thanks guys for a great show as always. Hope Jamie gets tacos till her tummy explodes. I love your rants and very logical points of view, Loki.

3133
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:18,660
This message brought to you by typing on a PSP.

3134
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:21,660
Sucks! Thanks again, guys. Blade 3.

3135
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:24,660
Sorry, what was the question out of that, too? A console developer?

3136
02:38:24,660 --> 02:38:29,660
What is the likelihood that a main console developer would cease to exist and what is the likelihood that a new console developer could come in?

3137
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:33,660
Now, I'm gonna go back and use, um, Sega.

3138
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:35,660
Okay, we still have Sega.

3139
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:37,660
Or is it Sammy Sega now?

3140
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:42,660
But they did stop developing consoles.

3141
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:47,660
They're still around, but we don't have them as a console developer anymore.

3142
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:53,660
That's a really good question. Um, I don't think it's gonna happen right now.

3143
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:54,660
Coleco's gone.

3144
02:38:54,660 --> 02:38:58,660
Well, yeah, no, and NEC did the TurboGrafx, right?

3145
02:38:58,660 --> 02:38:59,660
Atari.

3146
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:00,660
But NEC is still around.

3147
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:03,660
Right, all these companies are still around, but they don't have consoles anymore.

3148
02:39:03,660 --> 02:39:04,660
Yeah.

3149
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:12,660
Um, well, there's also, you could go minor. You could say Philips had the CDi, Apple had the Pippin.

3150
02:39:12,660 --> 02:39:13,660
Magnavox.

3151
02:39:13,660 --> 02:39:14,660
You know, none of these really made a splash, but they did exist.

3152
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:17,660
Um, eww, this is really hard.

3153
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:27,660
I think quite likely, because of the ones out now, the real newcomers would be Sony and Microsoft.

3154
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,660
And Apple.

3155
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:29,660
And Apple.

3156
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:36,660
I still say the i-blank is a gaming device, and that's kind of where, I don't know, a lot of portables going.

3157
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:45,660
Um, you know, the thing is, as far as someone exiting, despite the news we've been talking about this week,

3158
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:49,660
when it comes to the pure sales, none of the systems have been doing terribly.

3159
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:51,660
None of them have tanked.

3160
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:52,660
No.

3161
02:39:52,660 --> 02:39:58,660
And that's usually why a console, you know, why a company disappears, because they release a console that just tanks.

3162
02:39:58,660 --> 02:39:59,660
And that really hasn't happened.

3163
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:00,660
But we really have our big three.

3164
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:01,660
Yeah.

3165
02:40:01,660 --> 02:40:09,660
And two of our big three are newcomers within the last 15 years?

3166
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:11,660
PlayStation's about 15 years old, so yeah.

3167
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:12,660
Yeah.

3168
02:40:12,660 --> 02:40:13,660
A little over 50.

3169
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:16,660
That came out in 94, or 95.

3170
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:28,660
But it was, Sony's additions, well, contributions to the console market, they did the SNES's sound processor.

3171
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:34,660
I just, I think it's too much for a fourth person to come in, but I think if it's going to be anyone, it's going to be Apple.

3172
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:42,660
I think they're going to try to sneak their stuff onto your TV through Apple TV and all this stuff, more so than they already have.

3173
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:45,660
And I don't think it's that Apple's really trying to get into gaming.

3174
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:49,660
Apple's just in it to make money.

3175
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:50,660
So we'll see.

3176
02:40:50,660 --> 02:40:53,660
But as far as one of the other three going away, I don't think so.

3177
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:57,660
One of them's going to have to release a real stinker for that to happen.

3178
02:40:57,660 --> 02:41:00,660
And I don't see any of them as particularly vulnerable right now.

3179
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:10,660
But obviously if Nintendo's going a completely different direction with this console, could be a risky move, especially since 3DS didn't go up to expectations.

3180
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:12,660
But I don't think the 3DS is doing terribly.

3181
02:41:12,660 --> 02:41:15,660
It's not doing enough where it's going to bankrupt the company.

3182
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,660
Yet, anyway.

3183
02:41:16,660 --> 02:41:18,660
Well that was actually, I think, a really good email.

3184
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:22,660
Thank you for contributing.

3185
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:24,660
MegaBoyX in our chatroom says, screw Apple.

3186
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:26,660
I think that's what a lot of people say.

3187
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:29,660
I think you just mean facts are facts.

3188
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:33,660
iPhone, iPads, iPods, all that shit sells really well.

3189
02:41:33,660 --> 02:41:35,660
And games are available on all of them.

3190
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:40,660
Enough so that Nintendo has had to comment on it and kind of dog the competition.

3191
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:43,660
So, they are a player.

3192
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:44,660
No.

3193
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:46,660
Alright, that's it for the email bag.

3194
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:48,660
Now is the part of the show where we're going to get ranty.

3195
02:41:48,660 --> 02:41:50,660
It's the FUs of the week.

3196
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:51,660
Rawr.

3197
02:41:51,660 --> 02:42:13,660
My FU goes towards my last week and finals week of school.

3198
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:17,660
I have a lot of work to get done and not that much time to get it done in.

3199
02:42:17,660 --> 02:42:23,660
And my second FU goes towards my really weird bout of exhaustion slash insomnia

3200
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:29,660
that's been making me completely wiped out and kind of burned on everything going on.

3201
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:31,660
So, I'll figure it out.

3202
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:33,660
It's probably just end of school stress.

3203
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:34,660
Okay.

3204
02:42:34,660 --> 02:42:35,660
Loki?

3205
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:41,660
FU to the upcoming hot that's going to be coming this week.

3206
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:46,660
I mean, it's not hot as what we normally get.

3207
02:42:46,660 --> 02:42:49,660
But it's going to get up to 85 degrees this week.

3208
02:42:49,660 --> 02:42:51,660
And that's not that bad.

3209
02:42:51,660 --> 02:42:55,660
But this time of year though, you know, 85 feels like 105.

3210
02:42:55,660 --> 02:42:58,660
And then once we hit 105, we're begging for 85.

3211
02:42:58,660 --> 02:43:01,660
But right now, it feels like 105.

3212
02:43:01,660 --> 02:43:03,660
So, dammit.

3213
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:04,660
I hate being hot.

3214
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:06,660
I like being cold.

3215
02:43:06,660 --> 02:43:07,660
Cold is easy.

3216
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:08,660
Put more layers on.

3217
02:43:08,660 --> 02:43:10,660
Hot, can't take more layers off.

3218
02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:12,660
It only takes so many layers.

3219
02:43:12,660 --> 02:43:14,660
My FU of the week, I don't know.

3220
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:15,660
Things have been pretty good actually.

3221
02:43:15,660 --> 02:43:20,660
I'll just FU to me not usually getting enough sleep at night.

3222
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:22,660
I should stop doing that.

3223
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:24,660
Oh, FU to having to work on Saturday.

3224
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:28,660
That's definitely worthy of an FU because that's why I had to get up early on Saturday.

3225
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:30,660
Exactly.

3226
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:38,660
I actually was not forced to come in, but I just did it because when people ask me nicely,

3227
02:43:38,660 --> 02:43:41,660
I tend to do nice things even though I might not really like them.

3228
02:43:41,660 --> 02:43:42,660
All right.

3229
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:43,660
Moving on.

3230
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:46,660
Let's get into a couple more news stories.

3231
02:43:46,660 --> 02:43:48,660
And then finally, the Skype line.

3232
02:43:48,660 --> 02:43:50,660
I expect it to be ringing off the hook tonight, but we'll see.

3233
02:43:50,660 --> 02:43:51,660
All right.

3234
02:43:51,660 --> 02:43:53,660
Let's get into some other news.

3235
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:54,660
Loki.

3236
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:55,660
Yes, this is kind of funny.

3237
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:59,660
It's one of the most annoying characters ever.

3238
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:03,660
Getting kind of a return in sort of a gaming form.

3239
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:10,660
Microsoft Office's Clippy is getting its own tutorial slash game.

3240
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:14,660
I guess Ribbon Hero 2 Clippy Second Chance.

3241
02:44:14,660 --> 02:44:25,660
It's a video game slash tutorial to kind of walk you through some of the new features of Microsoft Office.

3242
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:28,660
It says, yes, we've turned Office into a game.

3243
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:33,660
If you're going to spend time immersed in the inner workings of Office, by golly, it should be fun.

3244
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:39,660
Discover new Office features by actually using them with hit button to fall back on in case you get stuck.

3245
02:44:39,660 --> 02:44:42,660
Race for a high score with colleagues, classmates, and friends.

3246
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:47,660
You can put your high score on your resume to show off your Office skills.

3247
02:44:47,660 --> 02:44:49,660
I don't recommend doing that.

3248
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:53,660
For those of you who have been paying attention, we've done this before.

3249
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:56,660
That's how we've got the two at the end of the title.

3250
02:44:56,660 --> 02:44:58,660
So what's different?

3251
02:44:58,660 --> 02:44:59,660
Clippy.

3252
02:44:59,660 --> 02:45:04,660
Comic strips, colorful graphics, surprise animations, multiple levels, time travel, upside down.

3253
02:45:04,660 --> 02:45:15,660
Clippy, spaceships, Greek gods, bow and arrow battles, and tons of useful Office features.

3254
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:18,660
Will it slow down your computer insanely too?

3255
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:21,660
That's what Clippy was always best for.

3256
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:24,660
Alright, moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.

3257
02:45:24,660 --> 02:45:27,660
It's about a big, big PC game that's set to come out soon.

3258
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:29,660
Diablo 3.

3259
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:30,660
When is it coming out?

3260
02:45:30,660 --> 02:45:33,660
Well, some are saying possibly 2011.

3261
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:36,660
I kind of hate news stories like this because it kind of seems obvious.

3262
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:38,660
Well, it's either coming out this year or next.

3263
02:45:38,660 --> 02:45:39,660
I mean, no shit.

3264
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:41,660
But here's what's causing the speculation.

3265
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:42,660
No, no, no, it should have been.

3266
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:44,660
It's either coming out this year or later.

3267
02:45:44,660 --> 02:45:45,660
Yeah.

3268
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:46,660
Here's what's causing the speculation.

3269
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:50,660
The game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, said this to the New York Times.

3270
02:45:50,660 --> 02:45:53,660
Quote, we're definitely in the home stretch.

3271
02:45:53,660 --> 02:45:54,660
We're crunching.

3272
02:45:54,660 --> 02:45:56,660
This is when the magic happens.

3273
02:45:56,660 --> 02:45:58,660
But, I mean, for Blizzard?

3274
02:45:58,660 --> 02:45:59,660
Shit.

3275
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:00,660
That could mean anything.

3276
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:01,660
I hope it's this year.

3277
02:46:01,660 --> 02:46:03,660
I would love to be playing Diablo 3 by Christmas.

3278
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:06,660
I'm hoping BlizzCon will shed some light on that.

3279
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:09,660
Especially since they're not going to be releasing a WoW expansion this year.

3280
02:46:09,660 --> 02:46:11,660
They may have a Starcraft 2 expansion.

3281
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:14,660
But otherwise, there's nothing for Blizzard to release this year.

3282
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:16,660
So I sort of hope it is Diablo 3.

3283
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:18,660
I would say it's got to release in the...

3284
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:20,660
Well, they have a new MMO they're working on.

3285
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:22,660
Yeah, but that's not coming out until, like, 2013.

3286
02:46:22,660 --> 02:46:24,660
Doesn't mean they can't announce it.

3287
02:46:24,660 --> 02:46:26,660
They can announce it, but it won't make them money.

3288
02:46:26,660 --> 02:46:27,660
An announcement doesn't make you money.

3289
02:46:27,660 --> 02:46:30,660
Well, that's not necessarily true there, no.

3290
02:46:30,660 --> 02:46:34,660
Because an announcement at BlizzCon makes them money.

3291
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:36,660
Because people go to BlizzCon for those announcements.

3292
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:39,660
They could get up on stage and announce that they just pooped.

3293
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:43,660
And people would pay $175 to still go.

3294
02:46:43,660 --> 02:46:46,660
Because that's what BlizzCon's turned into.

3295
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:53,660
It's people paying to watch what they should be able to see at E3 on TV for free.

3296
02:46:53,660 --> 02:46:56,660
And I love the Blizzard products.

3297
02:46:56,660 --> 02:46:59,660
I just haven't loved them as much since Activision bought them.

3298
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:02,660
But anyway, if you want to know more about that, go listen to the other show.

3299
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:05,660
Meanwhile, let's get into the calls.

3300
02:47:05,660 --> 02:47:07,660
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

3301
02:47:07,660 --> 02:47:09,660
or our username on Skype is OrangeLaundryAD.

3302
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:10,660
The phones are open.

3303
02:47:10,660 --> 02:47:14,660
PSN, Xbox, whatever you want to talk about in the gaming world.

3304
02:47:14,660 --> 02:47:15,660
Give us a call.

3305
02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:17,660
We'll let you talk for a minute here.

3306
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:18,660
Kaijuto in our chatroom says,

3307
02:47:18,660 --> 02:47:20,660
I think Diablo 3 is going to be a letdown.

3308
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:21,660
I really hope not.

3309
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:24,660
Like, there's a part of me that doesn't want to argue with you.

3310
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:26,660
Because you might be right, but I just really hope not.

3311
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:27,660
I hope you're wrong.

3312
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:29,660
I think it won't be worth the development time.

3313
02:47:29,660 --> 02:47:30,660
I'll put it that way.

3314
02:47:30,660 --> 02:47:32,660
I mean, I don't know.

3315
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:34,660
Blizzard doesn't really seem to put out bad games, though.

3316
02:47:34,660 --> 02:47:36,660
You know, Starcraft 2 is still really good.

3317
02:47:36,660 --> 02:47:38,660
WoW has all been great.

3318
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:40,660
But then again, Cataclysm did have a lot of problems.

3319
02:47:40,660 --> 02:47:43,660
It's been the weakest WoW expansion so far.

3320
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:46,660
It hasn't lived through its life expectancy yet.

3321
02:47:46,660 --> 02:47:50,660
But so far, it has not WoWed people,

3322
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:55,660
ironic, across the spectrum that the other expansions have, I would say.

3323
02:47:55,660 --> 02:47:57,660
S.J. in chat says,

3324
02:47:57,660 --> 02:48:02,660
I have zero hopes that it's coming out till it's in my hands.

3325
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:03,660
Well, you may be waiting for a little while.

3326
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:04,660
We'll see.

3327
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:06,660
Anyway, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

3328
02:48:06,660 --> 02:48:07,660
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

3329
02:48:07,660 --> 02:48:08,660
Who's this?

3330
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:10,660
It's Deathwishing.

3331
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:12,660
Hey, Deathwishing, how are you?

3332
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:15,660
I'm pretty good.

3333
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:16,660
I have to comment.

3334
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:17,660
I'm full of patriotism.

3335
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:18,660
Yeah, I know.

3336
02:48:18,660 --> 02:48:20,660
It's crazy what's going on in the world.

3337
02:48:20,660 --> 02:48:21,660
But I have to comment on this.

3338
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:22,660
It's so much more important.

3339
02:48:22,660 --> 02:48:24,660
I'm looking at your little Skype picture,

3340
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:26,660
which is very MySpace-y.

3341
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:27,660
Like, what is this?

3342
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:29,660
Are you taking a picture of yourself in the bathroom?

3343
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:31,660
Well, it's my senior year, right?

3344
02:48:31,660 --> 02:48:35,660
And my barbershop quartet, we all went to Disneyland,

3345
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:37,660
and my friend bought a fox hat, so I had to take a picture of it.

3346
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:38,660
Oh, that's what you're wearing.

3347
02:48:38,660 --> 02:48:39,660
I think it's a chick magnet.

3348
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:40,660
It's a chick magnet.

3349
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:41,660
All right, awesome.

3350
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:43,660
All right, well, what did you call in to talk about?

3351
02:48:43,660 --> 02:48:46,660
PSN stuff.

3352
02:48:46,660 --> 02:48:47,660
Okay.

3353
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:48,660
What are your thoughts?

3354
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:55,660
I guess PlayStation Network feels that they're obligated to give free stuff

3355
02:48:55,660 --> 02:49:01,660
on a free service to all the whiny 4chan babies.

3356
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:05,660
So you don't think they should be giving anything at all?

3357
02:49:05,660 --> 02:49:09,660
I only think they should be giving reimbursements to the people that pay

3358
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:12,660
for PlayStation Plus, you know, and the people that pay for services

3359
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:17,660
like DC Online and paying customers.

3360
02:49:17,660 --> 02:49:22,660
Not like everyone gets free stuff because you all bitch,

3361
02:49:22,660 --> 02:49:25,660
but we're going to say we're polite.

3362
02:49:25,660 --> 02:49:29,660
It's, I don't know, it kind of ends in the fact that I can't play SOCOM before.

3363
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:30,660
Now, be honest.

3364
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:34,660
Now, see, usually that sort of reaction comes from what you would call

3365
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:36,660
a Sony fanboy, so be honest.

3366
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:39,660
Are you a Sony fanboy?

3367
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:45,660
I own all systems, but I really, I mean, I kind of like it

3368
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:48,660
because I can get PlayStation Plus for free now just to try it out,

3369
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:52,660
but I guess I kind of am a Sony fanboy.

3370
02:49:52,660 --> 02:49:54,660
All right, see, see, all right.

3371
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:57,660
Well, I mean, what did you think of all this, the hacking and all that?

3372
02:49:57,660 --> 02:50:00,660
I mean, as a Sony fanboy, are you like, this could happen to anyone,

3373
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:03,660
or are you like, wow, maybe Sony kind of asked for this?

3374
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:06,660
I first went, wow, holy shit, I can't believe this happened,

3375
02:50:06,660 --> 02:50:09,660
and then after I saw, oh, we didn't have a crypt and stuff,

3376
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:14,660
I kind of just went, Sony, you set yourself up to this, you morons.

3377
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:18,660
I mean, you would think a company with all this money, with services,

3378
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:21,660
you know, in this age of day that has a service where, okay,

3379
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:25,660
we have for the developers, we can buy all of each other's games

3380
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:28,660
off our PlayStation Network, but we're going to keep it on the same server

3381
02:50:28,660 --> 02:50:31,660
because that's the smart thing to do.

3382
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:33,660
Oh, no, guys, we're hacked now, and guess what?

3383
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:36,660
Your credit card's out, and the whole thing with the way they work

3384
02:50:36,660 --> 02:50:38,660
the information, that just pissed me off, too.

3385
02:50:38,660 --> 02:50:43,660
It's like the United States, which I love.

3386
02:50:43,660 --> 02:50:52,660
Yeah, so do you agree with what we were saying earlier in the show

3387
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:56,660
about Sony is just hard-headed?

3388
02:50:56,660 --> 02:50:58,660
Very, very much so.

3389
02:50:58,660 --> 02:51:01,660
Why is it?

3390
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:05,660
Is Sony just drunk with power from being from the rampant success

3391
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:08,660
of the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2?

3392
02:51:08,660 --> 02:51:14,660
Well, yeah, I think so that. I think that what they're trying to,

3393
02:51:14,660 --> 02:51:19,660
you know, they're too afraid of the $599 US dollar system being, like, compromised.

3394
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:21,660
You know?

3395
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:22,660
Right.

3396
02:51:22,660 --> 02:51:26,660
What I'm talking about here, how it's like, oh, we have such an expensive system.

3397
02:51:26,660 --> 02:51:29,660
Oh, shit, we fucked up.

3398
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:32,660
I think that whole not encrypting the data is going to be a real thing

3399
02:51:32,660 --> 02:51:34,660
that comes back to bite him in the ass.

3400
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:37,660
I think if this thing does go to trial, that's going to be the piece of it.

3401
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:40,660
You saw the stock prices go down, right?

3402
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:43,660
Oh, well, of course. Of course their stock price is going to go down.

3403
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:45,660
Yeah, it already bit them.

3404
02:51:45,660 --> 02:51:46,660
Oh, yeah.

3405
02:51:46,660 --> 02:51:49,660
Especially how much of big releases for them came out that week, too.

3406
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:53,660
Hence me buying, actually, one of those releases and not being able to play it.

3407
02:51:53,660 --> 02:51:54,660
Yeah.

3408
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:56,660
Well, not being able to play it online, but still.

3409
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:58,660
What is going on with SOCOM right now?

3410
02:51:58,660 --> 02:52:02,660
Does SOCOM even have a single player? It does, right?

3411
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:06,660
If you can call it that.

3412
02:52:06,660 --> 02:52:10,660
Interesting question. I like this comment from bonds006 in the chat room.

3413
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:14,660
If any one of us was working in the higher ranks of Sony,

3414
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:18,660
would we do something different?

3415
02:52:18,660 --> 02:52:22,660
I told, I mean, I was trying to get, if I was in the higher ranks,

3416
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:26,660
I would have ran up to the frickin' night key people in there

3417
02:52:26,660 --> 02:52:29,660
and punched them all in the dick.

3418
02:52:29,660 --> 02:52:31,660
Let me put it this way.

3419
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:36,660
Yes, if I were Kazurai, I would have promptly fired the person in IT

3420
02:52:36,660 --> 02:52:38,660
and I would have announced to the world that that's what we did

3421
02:52:38,660 --> 02:52:40,660
and that's what we're going to change.

3422
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:42,660
But, I don't know.

3423
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:45,660
That's, yeah, that's I think what I would have done, too.

3424
02:52:45,660 --> 02:52:48,660
I don't know if I would have punched them in the dick, but maybe with words.

3425
02:52:48,660 --> 02:52:51,660
Hey, hey, they had it coming.

3426
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:52,660
Yeah, I know.

3427
02:52:52,660 --> 02:52:58,660
But Xbox fanboys, user service did go down for three weeks in 2007, too.

3428
02:52:58,660 --> 02:52:59,660
Three weeks?

3429
02:52:59,660 --> 02:53:01,660
I don't remember Xbox being down for three weeks.

3430
02:53:01,660 --> 02:53:03,660
Three days, maybe.

3431
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:06,660
I had to do over like December like a shitload of people rushed online

3432
02:53:06,660 --> 02:53:08,660
because they got their Xboxes.

3433
02:53:08,660 --> 02:53:11,660
That was like three days. It was not three weeks.

3434
02:53:11,660 --> 02:53:12,660
I think it was three weeks.

3435
02:53:12,660 --> 02:53:13,660
No, I think you're wrong.

3436
02:53:13,660 --> 02:53:16,660
It was like three days, three weeks of like getting the network back up fully running.

3437
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:20,660
If you want to get the Xbox fanboys, you need to go to the Red Ring of Death.

3438
02:53:20,660 --> 02:53:22,660
But again, because that was terrible.

3439
02:53:22,660 --> 02:53:26,660
However, Microsoft handled it much better than Sony's handling it so far.

3440
02:53:26,660 --> 02:53:29,660
So, all right.

3441
02:53:29,660 --> 02:53:30,660
True.

3442
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:31,660
Anyhow.

3443
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:33,660
It's all good in the tent. At least everything may have Prince money.

3444
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:36,660
All right, I got to let you guys, we can get more calls, and you're breaking up a little bit anyway.

3445
02:53:36,660 --> 02:53:38,660
So, take care, buddy.

3446
02:53:38,660 --> 02:53:39,660
Bye.

3447
02:53:39,660 --> 02:53:42,660
All right, that was Death Wishing, ladies and gentlemen,

3448
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:45,660
who apparently sings in a barbershop quartet that once performed at Disneyland.

3449
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:47,660
I never knew.

3450
02:53:47,660 --> 02:53:48,660
The things we learn about the listeners.

3451
02:53:48,660 --> 02:53:53,660
Maybe we need our listeners to tell us more secrets about themselves.

3452
02:53:53,660 --> 02:53:55,660
That's what I'd like to hear from the listeners that call in tonight.

3453
02:53:55,660 --> 02:53:57,660
We want to know something about you.

3454
02:53:57,660 --> 02:53:58,660
Tell us the secret.

3455
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:02,660
Nobody would know this by looking at me.

3456
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:04,660
All right, let's go to the phones and get another call.

3457
02:54:04,660 --> 02:54:05,660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3458
02:54:05,660 --> 02:54:08,660
Who's this?

3459
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:10,660
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

3460
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:11,660
¿Quien es?

3461
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:12,660
Hello?

3462
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:14,660
Hi, who's this?

3463
02:54:14,660 --> 02:54:15,660
Hey, can you hear me?

3464
02:54:15,660 --> 02:54:16,660
Yes.

3465
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:17,660
Hi, who is this?

3466
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:19,660
I've got a bad echo.

3467
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:20,660
Uh-oh, that's a problem.

3468
02:54:20,660 --> 02:54:21,660
Hold on a second.

3469
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:22,660
I'm sorry.

3470
02:54:22,660 --> 02:54:24,660
I didn't expect you guys to pick up that quick.

3471
02:54:24,660 --> 02:54:27,660
Sure, we'll hold.

3472
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:29,660
Can you hear us at all?

3473
02:54:29,660 --> 02:54:30,660
Yeah, there we go.

3474
02:54:30,660 --> 02:54:31,660
I had to kill my stream.

3475
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:32,660
That's all right.

3476
02:54:32,660 --> 02:54:33,660
It happens.

3477
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:34,660
Yeah, yeah.

3478
02:54:34,660 --> 02:54:35,660
First rule of calling into radio.

3479
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:36,660
Turn off your radio.

3480
02:54:36,660 --> 02:54:37,660
All right.

3481
02:54:37,660 --> 02:54:38,660
Who is this?

3482
02:54:38,660 --> 02:54:39,660
Hey, this is Blue Swim.

3483
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:40,660
Hi, Blue Swim.

3484
02:54:40,660 --> 02:54:44,660
All right, tell us something we wouldn't know by looking at you.

3485
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:51,660
Well, I'm a Spice Girls fan.

3486
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:52,660
Awesome.

3487
02:54:52,660 --> 02:54:53,660
Awesome.

3488
02:54:53,660 --> 02:54:54,660
All right, great secret.

3489
02:54:54,660 --> 02:54:55,660
All right.

3490
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:58,660
All right, what's on your mind tonight?

3491
02:54:58,660 --> 02:55:01,660
Forgive me if you already touched on this.

3492
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:03,660
I was in and out of the room.

3493
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:04,660
Yeah, I know.

3494
02:55:04,660 --> 02:55:06,660
There's a lot of news going on in the world.

3495
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:08,660
It's fine.

3496
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:16,660
Did you weigh in on the show about IGN's little fake or gay article?

3497
02:55:16,660 --> 02:55:21,660
No, there was a part of me that didn't want to go there, but if the listeners want to

3498
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:22,660
go there, then fine.

3499
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:25,660
Why don't you do some reporting on this?

3500
02:55:25,660 --> 02:55:28,660
Tell us a little bit about what happened and how you feel about it.

3501
02:55:28,660 --> 02:55:40,660
Well, basically, IGN took the time to write a little article detailing the sexuality of

3502
02:55:40,660 --> 02:55:44,660
Yoshi and Turok, of all people.

3503
02:55:44,660 --> 02:55:54,660
Basically, they went through this whole long detailed article explaining that Yoshi is,

3504
02:55:54,660 --> 02:56:00,660
I believe they used the phrase technically queer or something to that effect, because

3505
02:56:00,660 --> 02:56:10,660
he is dating Birdo, who apparently is a transsexual, if I got the article right.

3506
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:16,660
My browser's kind of going slow there for a minute.

3507
02:56:16,660 --> 02:56:18,660
Yeah, so yeah.

3508
02:56:18,660 --> 02:56:23,660
I was told on Twitter that the article was actually written by somebody who was gay,

3509
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:25,660
which makes it stranger.

3510
02:56:25,660 --> 02:56:26,660
I don't know.

3511
02:56:26,660 --> 02:56:27,660
It makes the whole thing weirder.

3512
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:32,660
But as I mentioned on Twitter, articles are written to generate hits, and that's one reason

3513
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:36,660
why I wouldn't link it for my Twitter, because I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.

3514
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:42,660
And I think these sorts of rampant speculation, it just adds fuel to all that stuff, and it's

3515
02:56:42,660 --> 02:56:43,660
just unnecessary.

3516
02:56:43,660 --> 02:56:50,660
If you want to write an interesting article about sexuality, why not talk about the impact

3517
02:56:50,660 --> 02:56:51,660
of that?

3518
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:55,660
Or why are more games not putting it in their storylines?

3519
02:56:55,660 --> 02:56:59,660
Or what is it that gay folks want in gaming?

3520
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:01,660
Maybe interview them.

3521
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:03,660
It's probably the same thing as everyone else, to be honest.

3522
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:04,660
I'll tell you that.

3523
02:57:04,660 --> 02:57:06,660
I don't know, just an article like that just seemed so unnecessary.

3524
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:11,660
Or give us an article with a developer for Dragon Age, or one of the studios that actually

3525
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:15,660
put a gay character in the game, about how they did it, and how they made sure to address

3526
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:20,660
the sensitivity by making it realistic without being a joke.

3527
02:57:20,660 --> 02:57:22,660
I don't know.

3528
02:57:22,660 --> 02:57:27,660
Other than like, oh, Birdo's gay because of a misprint that was in an instruction manual

3529
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:29,660
so many years ago, because they used to rush the translation.

3530
02:57:29,660 --> 02:57:30,660
I mean, it's stupid.

3531
02:57:30,660 --> 02:57:34,660
But it actually has been official that Birdo is transgender.

3532
02:57:34,660 --> 02:57:35,660
But still.

3533
02:57:35,660 --> 02:57:39,660
Wasn't that confirmed in Captain Rainbow or something like that?

3534
02:57:39,660 --> 02:57:44,660
That Nintendo Wii game that only came out in Japan several years ago?

3535
02:57:44,660 --> 02:57:48,660
Also, there's plenty of folks that would argue that just because you date somebody who's

3536
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:50,660
transsexual doesn't make you one sexuality or another.

3537
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:53,660
I think some people just care too much about who's gay and who's straight.

3538
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:57,660
I think just love whoever you want to love and be over it, you know?

3539
02:57:57,660 --> 02:57:59,660
That's just me.

3540
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:04,660
I'm all for equal rights.

3541
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:06,660
Well, what did you think when you read the article?

3542
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:09,660
Did it piss you off, or were you like, too many people were getting their panties ruffled

3543
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:12,660
over this?

3544
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:20,660
When I first saw on IGN's Twitter, when I first saw the title of this, I didn't even

3545
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:26,660
have to click on it before I'm thinking, what are they fucking doing?

3546
02:58:26,660 --> 02:58:32,660
It just seemed like a desperate grab for hits.

3547
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:36,660
It was unnecessary.

3548
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:39,660
It just seemed like pure bullshit to me.

3549
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:45,660
It's not an article that they needed to write.

3550
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:49,660
It's not an editorial they needed to write.

3551
02:58:49,660 --> 02:58:53,660
I'm looking at our chatroom here, and Makeup Boy X is in our chatroom saying,

3552
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:56,660
yeah, the guy on IGN came out as gay recently.

3553
02:58:56,660 --> 02:58:58,660
He was just trying to write a fun article about it.

3554
02:58:58,660 --> 02:59:03,660
I'm just kind of like, well, why not write an article about coming out as gay then in

3555
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:06,660
gaming culture?

3556
02:59:06,660 --> 02:59:08,660
Is Yoshi gay?

3557
02:59:08,660 --> 02:59:09,660
Is this so weird?

3558
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:10,660
I don't know.

3559
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:11,660
It's unnecessary.

3560
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:12,660
It's unnecessary.

3561
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:15,660
That's, I think, the best thing I can think of to describe it.

3562
02:59:15,660 --> 02:59:17,660
It was just unnecessary.

3563
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:24,660
Yeah, I know they were kind of joking about whether Yoshi was a man or a woman in Super

3564
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:33,660
Smash Brothers during Snake and Otacon's conversation before a fight with Yoshi.

3565
02:59:33,660 --> 02:59:42,660
I remember them just bickering back and forth about, but he lays eggs, but it's a boy.

3566
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:43,660
Oh my gosh.

3567
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:45,660
All right, well, we've got to let you go to get some more calls.

3568
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:48,660
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3569
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:52,660
I just want to tell Defective Candy thank you for, I tell you what I want, what I really,

3570
02:59:52,660 --> 02:59:54,660
really want over Twitter.

3571
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:55,660
All right.

3572
02:59:55,660 --> 03:00:01,660
Well, I have one final thought for you along those lines.

3573
03:00:01,660 --> 03:00:04,660
There you go.

3574
03:00:04,660 --> 03:00:06,660
That's not Viva Forever.

3575
03:00:06,660 --> 03:00:08,660
It's not Viva Forever.

3576
03:00:08,660 --> 03:00:09,660
It's the song I happen to have up.

3577
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:10,660
All right.

3578
03:00:10,660 --> 03:00:11,660
Have a go on Blue Swim.

3579
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:12,660
Take care, buddy.

3580
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:13,660
Thank you very much.

3581
03:00:13,660 --> 03:00:14,660
You too.

3582
03:00:14,660 --> 03:00:15,660
All right.

3583
03:00:15,660 --> 03:00:16,660
1877 Game OLR.

3584
03:00:16,660 --> 03:00:18,660
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3585
03:00:18,660 --> 03:00:21,660
Let me ask if there's any last minute stories.

3586
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:22,660
I guess I should check in with Loki.

3587
03:00:22,660 --> 03:00:24,660
I hate to pull you from the portal.

3588
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:25,660
No, that's all right.

3589
03:00:25,660 --> 03:00:26,660
All right.

3590
03:00:26,660 --> 03:00:27,660
No, we do have some last minute stories.

3591
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:32,660
Of course, there's, I don't know why you would buy in the collection now, maybe because Final

3592
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:34,660
Fantasy XIV is still broken.

3593
03:00:34,660 --> 03:00:37,660
But Final Fantasy XI, if you happen to want to join that right now, there's actually a

3594
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:39,660
good collection they have out there.

3595
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:45,660
They updated their ultimate collection now with the Ibiza edition, and it includes basically

3596
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:54,660
the game plus all the expansions plus the extra Ibiza, I guess, expansions.

3597
03:00:54,660 --> 03:00:58,660
There are three add-on scenarios, all for 20 bucks.

3598
03:00:58,660 --> 03:01:01,660
Okay, Loki, I want you to point at me and get ready to laugh.

3599
03:01:01,660 --> 03:01:02,660
Yeah.

3600
03:01:02,660 --> 03:01:08,660
Because I kind of want to go back and play, just for a couple weeks, just to relive old

3601
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:10,660
times, like revisiting an old friend.

3602
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:16,660
And then on top of that, you do get a special beret that I guess will increase skill gain,

3603
03:01:16,660 --> 03:01:21,660
extra movement speed, and both magic and health regeneration.

3604
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:26,660
And that's, I guess the new edition will be available to download May 16th.

3605
03:01:26,660 --> 03:01:28,660
That's kind of cool.

3606
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:37,660
I want to, it's just a small part of me that kind of wants to go, just go hug an old friend.

3607
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:44,660
And then there's rumor that Ocarina of Time 3D is going to be a limited initial release.

3608
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:45,660
Why?

3609
03:01:45,660 --> 03:01:53,660
I mean, other than them being disappointed about the 3DS launch numbers, why would you

3610
03:01:53,660 --> 03:01:55,660
do that?

3611
03:01:55,660 --> 03:02:00,660
Make it extremely small so that people are trying to find it?

3612
03:02:00,660 --> 03:02:02,660
See, Nintendo toys with their customers like that.

3613
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:04,660
That's the type of company they are.

3614
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:05,660
Awesome.

3615
03:02:05,660 --> 03:02:09,660
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll free up one extra copy for those people looking for it,

3616
03:02:09,660 --> 03:02:14,660
because I'm not buying it.

3617
03:02:14,660 --> 03:02:19,660
And last but not least, if you don't like Madden, yet you still want a football game,

3618
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:24,660
All Pro Football 2K8, they have released, there's an editor that's been released for

3619
03:02:24,660 --> 03:02:29,660
it, for the Xbox 360 version, using some file editing.

3620
03:02:29,660 --> 03:02:33,660
And this can be done on non-modded consoles, by the way.

3621
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:41,660
You can actually update your rosters, you can also create custom teams, I guess adjusting

3622
03:02:41,660 --> 03:02:50,660
stats and players and all that stuff, ratings, abilities, physical appearance, and basically

3623
03:02:50,660 --> 03:02:57,660
create your own teams if you want, or base them off of the actual NFL teams.

3624
03:02:57,660 --> 03:03:03,660
And I'm sure All Pro Football 2K8 is probably dirt cheap nowadays.

3625
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:08,660
So if you're interested in that, check out operationsports.com, they had a feature running

3626
03:03:08,660 --> 03:03:15,660
on it, it's Flying Finn releases All Pro Football 2K8 editor.

3627
03:03:15,660 --> 03:03:16,660
That's it.

3628
03:03:16,660 --> 03:03:17,660
That's it.

3629
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:21,660
Alright, again, I'll give the number one more time, 1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype

3630
03:03:21,660 --> 03:03:26,660
is Orange Lounge Radio, I know probably not a lot of people want to call in at this point,

3631
03:03:26,660 --> 03:03:29,660
I thought it was going to be a busy phone line tonight, but probably just too many people

3632
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:33,660
distracted with other things going on in the world, and I guess I can understand that.

3633
03:03:33,660 --> 03:03:40,660
But one more time, 1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3634
03:03:40,660 --> 03:03:45,660
So, what do we talk about for a few more minutes while we wait for the phones to ring?

3635
03:03:45,660 --> 03:03:48,660
This is such a funny image.

3636
03:03:48,660 --> 03:03:49,660
Oh, one of the...

3637
03:03:49,660 --> 03:03:53,660
Yeah, someone finally did like a little image of Obama, it says, sorry it took so long to

3638
03:03:53,660 --> 03:03:57,660
get you a copy of my birth certificate, I was too busy killing Osama Bin Laden.

3639
03:03:57,660 --> 03:03:58,660
That's funny.

3640
03:03:58,660 --> 03:04:01,660
I don't know, I don't know.

3641
03:04:01,660 --> 03:04:05,660
I don't want to, I have things I want to say, but I don't want to get too political on the

3642
03:04:05,660 --> 03:04:12,660
show, but I'm just, I just hope that this will be the first step in this all being over.

3643
03:04:12,660 --> 03:04:15,660
So, that's all I'll say on that.

3644
03:04:15,660 --> 03:04:20,660
Alright, well, I guess that's it, we're done.

3645
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:22,660
We're going to go ahead and close up the lines.

3646
03:04:22,660 --> 03:04:26,660
It is, it's got, it's 1230 on the east coast anyway, so we're done.

3647
03:04:26,660 --> 03:04:29,660
Let's go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

3648
03:04:29,660 --> 03:04:34,660
But first, let me also say this, if you liked Orange Lounge Radio, if you like the show

3649
03:04:34,660 --> 03:04:37,660
here, do help spread the word about the show.

3650
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:40,660
Tell a friend or, you know, a nice five star review on iTunes is great too.

3651
03:04:40,660 --> 03:04:43,660
There's been some really nice ones written in the past couple days, really appreciate

3652
03:04:43,660 --> 03:04:44,660
it you guys.

3653
03:04:44,660 --> 03:04:47,660
I do read them and they make me smile, so thank you guys very much for those that leave

3654
03:04:47,660 --> 03:04:48,660
those.

3655
03:04:48,660 --> 03:04:49,660
Really appreciate it.

3656
03:04:49,660 --> 03:04:51,660
So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3657
03:04:51,660 --> 03:04:53,660
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

3658
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:55,660
We.

3659
03:04:55,660 --> 03:04:57,660
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3660
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:59,660
Portal 2 is pretty awesome.

3661
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:02,660
Chapter 2, getting into it.

3662
03:05:02,660 --> 03:05:06,660
My final thought is ice cream.

3663
03:05:06,660 --> 03:05:07,660
What?

3664
03:05:07,660 --> 03:05:08,660
I know.

3665
03:05:08,660 --> 03:05:10,660
There's Baskin Robbins around the corner.

3666
03:05:10,660 --> 03:05:13,660
I know, but they'll be closed by the time we're done with Afterbirth and all that.

3667
03:05:13,660 --> 03:05:14,660
Alright, that's it guys.

3668
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:16,660
Thank you so much for listening to the show.

3669
03:05:16,660 --> 03:05:20,660
Let's hope that PSN comes back in the next week and maybe we'll forget about it by next

3670
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:21,660
week.

3671
03:05:21,660 --> 03:05:22,660
Likely not.

3672
03:05:22,660 --> 03:05:25,660
But all the latest in gaming news and all that good stuff and your voices.

3673
03:05:25,660 --> 03:05:27,660
Once again, same bat time, same bat channel.

3674
03:05:27,660 --> 03:05:28,660
We'll see you next week.

3675
03:05:28,660 --> 03:05:29,660
Thanks everybody.

3676
03:05:29,660 --> 03:05:32,660
