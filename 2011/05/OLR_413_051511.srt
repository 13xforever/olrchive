00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,840
Tonight, May 15th, 2011, PlayStation Network returns after a three-week hiatus, a new entry

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,980
in a popular fighting franchise is announced, and a classic Sega Genesis video game is localized

3
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,840
for a new release.

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,800
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,620
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,520
First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Hi.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
How are you?

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
I am accomplished.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
You're accomplished.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Why is that?

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
Because I beat Portal 2 just now.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
Congratulations.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,720
I walked in like right as the ending was going on.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm not going to spoil what happens, but I was like, oh, it's this part.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
I like this part.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,440
So I like the all of that part.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,800
I figured you would.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
All right.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,640
Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Hello.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
Now what is this you're eating tonight?

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
That looks burnt.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,280
Yeah, they don't, they don't understand what well done means versus, you know, torch.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
Your pizza looks burnt or dead.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
It's certainly well done.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
What is this?

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Is this quadruple bacon pizza again?

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
No, it's still triple bacon.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
Oh, my bad.

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,160
How, how, how dare I increase the bacon anyhow?

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
We're going to get into the show.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,320
Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,160
right after the Bobby black Wolf show at all games radio, www dot all games.com.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,760
It's very easy to hear the show.

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,800
All you do is you go to all games.com and as long as you have what flash installed,

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
it comes right up.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
So it's very easy.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,760
You don't, you don't have to worry about any of those complicated, getting it into your

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,640
win amp or iTunes or whatever.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Very easy.

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
I said it were easy, but if you, but if you want to put it in, when you have an iTunes,

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you can do that too.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,760
There's more information at all games.com.

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,520
Um, also our chat room chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,080
It's very important to know we don't use the normal all games chat room.

49
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Why?

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
I don't know.

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
It's just the way we've done it.

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
And we've had our own chat room for like nine years.

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,840
Plus we like being in charge of our own chat room.

54
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,320
So it's a power thing.

55
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,220
Anyhow so chat dot orange lounge, radio.com is where you can join us to chat with us live

56
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,640
and give us your comments on what's going on, uh, such as break man in our chat room

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,000
tonight who says there is no such thing as too much bacon.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,120
I think we remember when we had the bacon party for one of your birthdays and there

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,160
was like all these bacon dishes here in house.

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
That was, that was too much bacon.

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,740
I have to say actually the smell is turning my stomach.

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,640
I was going to have a heart attack.

64
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,720
So anyhow, well you need, you'll have to get some Febreze or something to smell.

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
I don't know.

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,360
I've got Moroccan spice Febreze to cover Shermy's ass.

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,520
Yes, it smells good.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,080
All right.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,920
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into how was your gaming week.

70
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,260
Every week we talk about some of the games we've been playing this week, which I guess

71
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,160
every single podcast pretty much does that this day and age, but I swear we were doing

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
it this way for a long time.

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
How was your gaming week?

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,920
Well, I just beat portal two and I played some well and because certain people in our

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,200
guild are going to be helping me run through a dungeon and learn how to tank on Rebecca

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,240
black, I still love the character and I still have people's reactions.

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,440
I have made another character.

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,880
I remade my, my shaman and named her after my old, uh, one of my old tabletop characters.

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,480
His name is Bloodwin, very Welsh.

81
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,560
And uh, she's level 10, 11, 11.

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
She's 11.

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Wow.

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,520
You're starting to sound like me.

85
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
I played.

86
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Wow.

87
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Wow.

88
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
And more.

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Wow.

90
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm getting pissed off though.

91
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,240
I'm getting pissed off at the core and nobody can give me the 300 gold.

92
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,320
I need to get, uh, you'll have to earn it.

93
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,040
Do a herbalism and mining.

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
That's how I did it.

95
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,760
You just go collect things for a while and then sell.

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
That's how you do it.

97
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,000
Then I just need to get rid of tailoring anyhow.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
I don't want to fill up too much of a wow chat cause there's a whole nother show for

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
that now.

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
So anything else you've been playing this week?

101
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
No.

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
Seen any good movies lately?

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,960
I see a Tron thing behind you and that made me think like, Oh, Tron's on blue.

104
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm supposed to go see, um, Thor on Tuesday with Becky.

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Stay till after the credits.

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I know.

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
That's what everybody says.

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
I know.

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
All right.

110
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,320
There's only one character in that whole movie I care about seeing and he's only in one part

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
cause it's my dude.

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
All right.

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
But no spoilers.

114
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
All right.

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Loki, how was your gaming week?

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
What have you been playing?

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,560
Um, just really two things.

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Um, you know, portal two and um, grant the data and portal two.

119
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,200
I've chapter eight and um, grand theft auto.

120
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Well it's just grand theft auto.

121
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,960
We decided to start playing some grenade launcher only games, which is kind of fun.

122
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,360
Um, man, that's pretty much, that's about it.

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Wow.

124
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,020
You guys both haven't been playing anything new.

125
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
That's all right.

126
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,280
Uh, let's see me.

127
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
Uh, actually a lot of it's the same.

128
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,360
I have not played a lot of new stuff.

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
A lot of the same stuff.

130
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,560
I've also been playing portal two, uh, a little bit of mortal combat.

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,760
Um, as is, you know, I know we're getting into this in the news in a little bit, but

132
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,680
it's pretty completely fucking obvious.

133
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,560
PlayStation network came back up yesterday, so I was finally able to get in there and

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,680
uh, play some mortal combat online and I got my ass handed to me cause I'm just, I guess

135
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm just not good at fighters.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know.

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I need more practice.

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
Uh, but I was trying first match was a little laggy.

139
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,060
I was a little bit disappointed at how kind of laggy and it was one of those things where

140
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,280
the frames per second suffer.

141
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,580
Like that's how mortal combat kind of compensates for the lag is that your, your frames suffer.

142
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,680
But then I played another match today and it was fine.

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,940
It was very smooth and, and worked fine.

144
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,400
So I guess it really is just about who you're connecting to or the service is a little bit

145
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,560
wonky still.

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,600
Like I tried to log in today and I got the PlayStation is down for maintenance message.

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,880
So I did it like four times and it finally let me in.

148
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,400
So kind of weird how that's working, but whatever.

149
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,060
Um, otherwise, as far as new games go, there is one new game I've been playing this week

150
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,320
and uh, that is a downloadable game on Xbox live.

151
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,200
I believe it's on PlayStation network as well, but you know, haven't really been able to

152
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
tell for the past three weeks.

153
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
So, uh, it's on Xbox live arcade.

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,600
It's called might and magic clash of heroes, I think is what it's called.

155
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
It's a school.

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
Well, yeah, it's, it's interesting because it's, it's a DS game.

157
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,920
It was a DS game a few years ago, but I have kind of lost touch of the Nintendo DS scene

158
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
about four years ago.

159
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,640
There just hasn't really been a lot on the DS.

160
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,280
I really wanted to play that wasn't like a first party game.

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,520
Uh, but apparently this one was pretty good and I totally missed it.

162
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,200
Uh, so it's out now on Xbox live and apparently PlayStation network, not that you'll be able

163
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,840
to download that anytime soon.

164
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,680
Um, but it's a port of the DS version.

165
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,320
And from what I understand, they've done some redone graphics and things like that.

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,160
But let me tell you a little bit about the game.

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,920
It's very much a puzzle quest, gyro mancer, RPPG game, role playing puzzle game.

168
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,080
It's another one of these, um, the battle system.

169
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
If you watch somebody else play it, you're not going to understand what the hell is going

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,200
on, but it has a really good ramp up in the single player mode to kind of get you used

171
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
to things.

172
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,740
And the best way I could explain it, it's kind of like magical drop where you pull things

173
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,920
down from one column and put them in another column.

174
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,520
Only it's not like it doesn't move down slowly like magical drop does.

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,120
You only have a certain number of moves per turn and you do offensive attacks by vertical

176
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,580
lines and defensive attacks by horizontal lines.

177
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
So it's kind of neat.

178
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,960
And there's special pieces thrown in the mix.

179
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,080
And most importantly, you're playing head to head.

180
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,240
So there's like a line in the middle of the screen and you're working up towards that

181
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,080
middle line and your opponent is working, it's flipped.

182
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,960
They're working down in reverse.

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,040
So kind of neat how that makes the battle draw out.

184
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,240
So it's obviously because of that, it's a very slow paced RPG because each battle takes

185
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,320
some time.

186
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,840
But again, if you're into the puzzle quest two type of games where every battle is a

187
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,880
full Bejeweled match basically, this game is really right up that alley.

188
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,400
And I would say I actually found the game itself, the puzzle interface, to be kind of

189
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,120
a neat little thinker.

190
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,880
You know, and it's something a lot different from the Bejeweled-esque games, which pretty

191
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,440
much a lot of the other games that are out there in the RPPG series kind of fall into

192
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
right now.

193
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,400
Maybe the lone exception is that unremarkable one that Konami put out.

194
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,000
Puzzle Chronicles, I played that one for a little bit, didn't really find that that remarkable.

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,020
Sorry to Puzzle Chronicle fans.

196
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,240
But I did enjoy Puzzle Quest 2 and I enjoyed this Clash of Heroes.

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,120
So if you are into the puzzle games, you at least have to download the demo and check

198
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
it out.

199
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,900
That's the nice thing about Xbox Live Arcade and PSN whenever it's up, is that there are

200
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
demos.

201
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,900
So you know, there's not any harm in that other than I guess the bandwidth and time

202
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,280
to download the demo.

203
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,640
But yeah, if you're into the puzzle games, I really encourage you to check this one out

204
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,760
because I think it would be worthy to your collection.

205
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,960
Not just a single player mode, you can do Xbox Live matches.

206
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,040
I have not delved so far into that section yet, so I can't say a lot, but I can imagine

207
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,000
that is definitely something that the DS version probably didn't have.

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,180
Maybe it had it locally.

209
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,960
I don't know, I could be totally misstating, maybe someone in the chat will correct me.

210
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,440
I don't know if it had internet play.

211
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
Like I know DS has internet play, but obviously Xbox Live I think is a much bigger internet

212
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,320
audience than probably the DS was, so there you go.

213
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,440
Night Magic, Clash of Heroes, if you're into puzzle, RPPGs, check it out.

214
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,480
Otherwise that was pretty much my gaming week.

215
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,200
So let's get into housekeeping tonight, not a whole lot.

216
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,560
Still some shows coming up over the next few weeks.

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,680
We don't plan to have any weeks off anytime soon.

218
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,940
E3 week might be a challenge, which is weird because none of us are actually going to E3,

219
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,440
but Dark Soccer and I are going to LA.

220
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,720
Long story.

221
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,320
So we may or may not be back that Sunday.

222
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,280
I think we're going to try and make it back in time for the show, which would be good.

223
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
No promises though.

224
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
No promises though.

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Exactly.

226
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
So we'll let you know a little closer.

227
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
So you have to stop by the cheese factory on the way back.

228
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,960
That's still what, about three weeks away?

229
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
So we got a little time to figure that all out.

230
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,320
Meanwhile join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash

231
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,840
OLR, and of course our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,560
Alright let's move on.

233
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

234
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,320
CD Thunder in our chatroom says RPPG means Rob playing a video game rated PG.

235
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
Rob playing PG.

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,680
I guess my magic clash of heroes would be PG.

237
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,760
I mean there's cartoony sword fights, but no blood or anything like that.

238
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,520
Me playing Mortal Kombat would definitely not be rated PG because I giggle all the time

239
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,220
at the fatalities.

240
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,600
And I got to see the, what is it called?

241
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,800
Is that called the Deadpool?

242
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,640
Like I know that's also one of Dark Soccer's favorite comic book characters, but I think

243
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
it's what it's called.

244
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
The acid room.

245
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,320
I saw the stage fatality for that for the first time.

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
It was gross.

247
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
But I giggled.

248
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
It was funny.

249
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,400
I need to get my mom back over and show her that one.

250
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
You're supposed to bring the game over.

251
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh my bad.

252
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I forgot.

253
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Well I mean at some point.

254
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Come bring it over and play.

255
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,080
I need to take my phone for fantasy 13 back.

256
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,280
I'll go find it.

257
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
You better.

258
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,840
It's in the vault.

259
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
It's in there somewhere.

260
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,200
You know it's well taken care of.

261
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,600
Brakeman in our chatroom says Sky and Dark Sakura are going to Hollywood.

262
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
I bet they are going to be in a movie.

263
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
What are you hiding from us?

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Hmm.

265
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Maybe.

266
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Maybe not.

267
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Rama says.

268
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
A YouTube movie maybe.

269
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,600
Rama says Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and an all new team up special, Fear and Loathing

270
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
in Los Angeles.

271
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,000
Well we don't want to leave Loki out of all the fun stuff, but you know he has the baby.

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We can't stop here.

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,520
This is Activision country.

274
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Alright anyhow, let's move on.

275
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Gaming news.

276
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Start us off.

277
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Loki.

278
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,480
So there was like a firmware update today for the PlayStation Network.

279
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Yay.

280
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
3.61.

281
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,000
It's basically the update that makes you change your PlayStation Network ID.

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,440
It was yesterday, but nobody knew.

283
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,600
Today, yesterday, who cares.

284
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
It all blends together.

285
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,040
You know, I don't really give a shit.

286
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,920
B, U, C. And I will say, okay, according to this post, this post was made on the 14th.

287
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,880
That would be, oh that would be yesterday.

288
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,800
Well I don't know my days, okay, so what can I say?

289
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,960
They all just blend together.

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
They all blend together, seriously.

291
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
What day is today?

292
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
No, I don't know.

293
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,960
Anyways, so yeah, firmware update, um, and of course that of course led to the PlayStation

294
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Network starting to come up, and I love this little very official Kazurai video where he's

295
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,760
like making a State of the Union address or something like that.

296
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,960
It was the blandest fucking message I've ever seen.

297
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,040
Like how bad, I'm like, I hate kicking these guys when they're down, but I was watching

298
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
it, I was falling asleep.

299
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,240
Like this is why people are drawn to Reggie Fils-Aime from Nintendo, because you feel

300
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,200
his enthusiasm, even when he's hawking such bullshit, like the vitality sensor or whatever,

301
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
you at least really feel his enthusiasm.

302
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,000
I think that's why he's very popular with gamers, but Kazurai is very, just like, so

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
vanilla.

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,640
Hello, my name is Kazurai, and I like to party.

305
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:16,920
We here at Sony embrace fun, hurrah, and I know my friends over here are now enjoying

306
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,320
the fun PlayStation Network.

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,480
Everybody happy.

308
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Party time.

309
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

310
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
Yesterday was Thursday, tomorrow is Saturday.

311
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,000
Hold on, I actually want to play a little bit of this.

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,040
Did you watch this Dark Sakura?

313
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,760
Tell me if this does not scream, I am a party animal.

314
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,800
All the patients that you've shown as we work through this restoration process.

315
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,160
Since the attacks on our networks, we've been working around the clock to bring game and

316
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,060
media services back online.

317
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,320
The service is being restored in phases, and I'm pleased to say that the first phase has

318
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,840
now been launched in most regions of the world.

319
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,080
And then I just spent a bunch of- What is he doing with his hands?

320
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,720
He makes these very, very distinct, like, this is the part where I'm going to clasp

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
my hands.

322
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,840
The teleprompter tells him to.

323
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,240
You think?

324
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,600
Fast Pines.

325
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,120
Now for the secret ingredient.

326
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,520
And with the money that we have lost, we're going to actually be raising a few of our

327
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,040
rates in the next few months to pay for this new teleprompter.

328
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,560
We had to keep it on a separate network because PSN is actually still down, and we're just

329
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,040
put psychedelics into your breakfast cereal so that you'll believe it's back up.

330
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,600
No seriously, we had to work around the clock, because some dumbass put a giant clock in

331
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,920
our server room, and we had to work around that damn thing because we couldn't move it

332
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
out of the way.

333
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,680
By we had to work around the clock, I mean everybody except me, where I went home and

334
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,800
ate crayons.

335
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,840
I especially like the green one, because when I cough it up later on, it looks like mucus

336
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,280
and I can gross out my kids.

337
00:14:51,280 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know, it just reminded me of, like, one of those, like, it's really cheesy acting

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
or something.

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know.

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I- Whatever.

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,560
He's reading off the teleprompter, because if you look where his eyes are fixated the

342
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,760
entire time, he's reading a teleprompter.

343
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,600
Or he's staring into your soul.

344
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
He can't, he has no soul.

345
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,160
Only people with souls can stare at other people with souls.

346
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,000
It's in the unwritten book of souls.

347
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,280
So anyways, yeah, PlayStation Network, the first phase, I guess leading up to the full

348
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,480
return by the end of May, included the following services, obviously the ability to sign into

349
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,920
the PlayStation Network and Curiosity, including resetting the passwords, restoration of online

350
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:48,520
gameplay, including PlayStation 3 and PSP, playback of rental video content, music unlimited

351
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,560
services from Curiosity, access to third party services such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and

352
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,120
MLB TV.

353
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,640
The friends category and PlayStation Home.

354
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,220
Yes, thank God PlayStation Home was part of that.

355
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,560
I missed it so much, because there's so much partying going on in PlayStation Home.

356
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:18,820
And then of course, it's fully back up throughout North America, which is awesome for us.

357
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,200
And I'm just running home right now to go sign up on the PlayStation Network to change

358
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,240
my password and play some games, oh wait it's not, because I don't care.

359
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,040
And then finally, Sony Online Entertainment announced that they're going to be offering

360
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,240
their members a free month, which is great since it's been down for a month, and they're

361
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,800
rewarding their players for the affected downtime, I guess some double XP events for EverQuest

362
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,840
and Vanguard, and they're going to be doing some special gear in DC Universe and Star

363
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Wars Galaxies.

364
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,640
I did see, well the DC Universe one, it's like some stupid cowl thing that looks like

365
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,560
you could be Batman or something.

366
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,880
And then Star Wars Galaxies, I'm surprised, I didn't even realize that was still up.

367
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
But hey, learned something.

368
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,480
And then finally, I guess lifetime subscribers will get another load in, or I guess some

369
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,240
more in-game currency, 500 station cash.

370
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
Whatever station cash is.

371
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm sorry, what?

372
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry, you're right.

373
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,440
My brain shut off for that whole thing right there.

374
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,440
So here's what I have to say, now that everybody's relieved to be back online and playing, is

375
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,840
anyone still mad?

376
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,520
Because I have a feeling by next week no one's going to be mad anymore, they're just forgetting

377
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
about it.

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,120
Well- Love Steam, I don't care.

379
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,480
I don't know.

380
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,520
With E3 so close and around the corner too, I mean, this is still going to be fresh in

381
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,700
people's minds when E3 rolls around, and that's one of the disadvantages that Sony's going

382
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
into this with.

383
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,760
I mean, and you can say that the Red Ring of Death thing was a big debacle too, but

384
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,280
you know, remember, Microsoft kind of finally, it took them long enough, they kind of came

385
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,160
out and admitted fault for that, and they were generally able to get over that whole

386
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
thing.

387
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,800
Whereas, I don't know, this is still really fresh in people's minds, we're still going

388
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,080
to have lawsuits after this that have yet to be settled and so on.

389
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,180
This is not over today, I mean, PlayStation Network is still not 100% back up.

390
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,640
You can't buy games online right now, and if you're a developer, that kind of sucks.

391
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
You know what I mean?

392
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Yeah.

393
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,880
Yeah, I don't know if you read one of the stories, well, there's some ridiculous stories,

394
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,960
you know, regarding this whole thing, but I mean, I don't know.

395
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,760
For me, it doesn't really matter, because I'm never on PlayStation Network, so it just

396
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,640
was an inconvenience because now I had to wait to activate my Steam copy of Portal 2.

397
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,200
Well, technically I didn't have to wait, but you know, it was such a non-event for me.

398
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I was like, eh, whatever.

399
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
So I'm not on it.

400
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
I can't be on it.

401
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Don't care.

402
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,240
Oh, actually, this is late breaking.

403
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,040
There's another video that was just released by Sony of Kazurai giving an update as to

404
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,480
what's going on on PlayStation Network.

405
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,280
Let's take a look and see what's going on in this latest announcement from Kazurai.

406
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,840
Bueller?

407
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,400
Bueller?

408
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,920
Bueller?

409
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,360
Bueller?

410
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,680
Bueller?

411
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:38,480
Oh, I guess the Bueller network will be coming back soon, I don't know.

412
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,680
All right, there you go.

413
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Anyhow.

414
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,960
I have some more PlayStation updates and what's going on.

415
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,760
Actually, mentioning about developers being pissed off, apparently publishers and developers

416
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,560
obviously have been out quite a bit of money.

417
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,040
You know, that's three weeks of lost sales and then some.

418
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,440
Again, the story is not back up just yet.

419
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,800
Apparently, Sony was not telling the developers and publishers really anything.

420
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,320
They only had the same information that the rest of us had.

421
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,040
Sony finally sent out a letter to its publishing partners.

422
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,080
It was sent out three weeks after the PlayStation Network went down, which is interesting.

423
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
Here's a clip of the letter.

424
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,880
Dear partner, as you know, certain PlayStation Network curiosity is, which by the way is

425
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
how you pronounce it, not core-yorosity.

426
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Curiosity?

427
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Queue.

428
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Curiosity.

429
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
Curiosity.

430
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,560
Well, I don't care.

431
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,760
Once again, I don't care.

432
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,440
Whoa, you're so clever for putting a queue there and making me try to figure out how

433
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,760
to pronounce a fucking thing.

434
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Guess what?

435
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,800
It's a service I don't fucking care to use, so I don't care to fucking know how to pronounce

436
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
it either.

437
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,920
As you know, blah, blah, blah, account information was compromised, criminal attacks, blah, blah,

438
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
blah.

439
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,960
I want to assure you as a PlayStation partner that it is Sony's top priority to restore

440
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,120
our network operations and see that business is returned to usual as soon as possible.

441
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,040
We are working around the clock to restore service, but we'll do so only when we can

442
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,680
ensure that the network can operate safely and securely, blah, blah, blah.

443
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,320
And then they go over exactly what happened, which really is all the stuff that you would

444
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,960
have got just reading the internet and the various game blogs and what's going on.

445
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,160
Let's see.

446
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,600
As a valued partner, we aim to keep the lines of communication open so that you are aware

447
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,320
of our progress.

448
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,080
Our focus has been to confirm the security of the networks, protect customer data, and

449
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,080
get the services back online as quickly as possible.

450
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,560
We will do our best to respond to all of your inquiries and we will do everything we can

451
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,880
to possibly support you.

452
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,700
I mean, that is a load of crap if I've ever heard it.

453
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,000
We aim to keep the lines of communication open.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,560
So that's why you're regurgitating what every news outlet has been saying for the past three

455
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
weeks.

456
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
That sucks.

457
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,960
If I was a PlayStation Network developer, I would be so mad about this.

458
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,120
Why weren't you upfront with us sooner?

459
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,440
And it's really going to give me pause in developing a PlayStation Network exclusive.

460
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,060
Sony is really going to have to, you know, as their game plan to get up and going again,

461
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,980
they're really going to have to shell out money for exclusive agreements.

462
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,240
It's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.

463
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,800
Anyhow, some other stuff with the whole PlayStation breach.

464
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,440
There's a rumor going around that a rented Amazon server was actually used to launch

465
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,520
the attack, which is interesting because Amazon was having all their issues, you know, and

466
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,360
the web service, not the, not the same portion of Amazon that sells the books and CDs.

467
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,720
We have to remember Amazon is a very large service and they also sell like web hosting

468
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
as part of their service.

469
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,200
And you might remember that a bunch of sites they hosted went down, which was a big deal

470
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,000
for Amazon because they have like, you know, service level agreements that were being broken

471
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and so forth.

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,160
Well, according to Bloomberg News, they are saying that the hackers who actually hacked

473
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,760
PlayStation Network rented a server from Amazon.com to do so, signing up for the service using

474
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,240
fake information.

475
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,800
Hmm.

476
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Interesting theory.

477
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,800
But, you know, pardon my ignorance, but how would this server be used to hack PlayStation

478
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Network?

479
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,160
I mean, a DDoS is one thing, but that's not what we're talking about happened here.

480
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,120
This is not a simple DDoS.

481
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,200
Somebody got in there and the information got exposed.

482
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,320
So how does that work using a cloud, uh, the cloud computer?

483
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,760
I mean, I just don't know enough about hacking Loki.

484
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Any ideas?

485
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,000
Well, if they're brute forcing something, the more computers they have working on it,

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the faster it goes.

487
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Hmm.

488
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,100
Well, you can, it can be guaranteed that if this is true, you can see a subpoena will

489
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,880
be going to out to Amazon very soon to try and figure out, you know, whose credit card

490
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,960
was used to sign up, which if that ends up being true, that was, um, it was kind of dumb

491
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,840
the hackers to do, but they probably used a fake or stolen credit card.

492
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Yeah, I'm sure.

493
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,800
Oh, we'll put all the real, you know, we'll put fake names, but the credit card, we'll

494
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,680
put a real credit card or a real credit card name or something like that.

495
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Hmm.

496
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:09,920
Uh, also one other quick thing, uh, about, um, this whole thing, uh, retailers are saying

497
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,400
that PlayStation three owners are just ditching the platform altogether and migrating to the

498
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
360.

499
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,800
This is gonna be ironic, hold on, just real quick.

500
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,240
You know, uh, one of the stories that came out before they were saying that there was

501
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,240
people that were hacking the PlayStation three using the, um, you know, the, it's a new custom

502
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,900
firmware called re, was it a re-bug or something like that.

503
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,800
And basically it gave them access to like the developer side of things where you can

504
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:42,100
buy PlayStation content using this, uh, credit card number that they had or whatever that

505
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,080
was associated with the developer stuff that allowed them to add, you know, funds to their

506
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,600
account and buy stuff without actually spending real money.

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh yeah.

508
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,040
Wouldn't it be ironic if they use that credit card number?

509
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,160
That would be hilarious.

510
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,000
Uh, apparently a lot of people were canceling their pre-orders for brink, uh, for the PlayStation

511
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
three.

512
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,520
Uh, lots of stuff going on in the used market, which I think dark soccer is going to get

513
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,800
into in a minute here, but, uh, yeah, lots of PlayStation threes being traded in.

514
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,160
People going to Xbox three 60 again, this is just from a source in Belgium.

515
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:23,180
Uh, you know, I'm sure, I'm sure there's an increase over normal, but I'm not sure if

516
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,280
it's a, Oh shit, PlayStation is damned a situation yet.

517
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,400
I mean people, I mean, if you're that fickle that you're going to just, you know, dump

518
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,720
your system because the networks down for a couple of weeks, then whatever, then you're

519
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,900
going to be, then you're going to be fickle enough to, you know, buy the system again

520
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,240
later on when there's something that you want to play on it, cause that's, what's going

521
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
to end up happening.

522
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,400
I mean, live goes down every once in a while for a day and stuff.

523
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,720
You don't see people like running on mass, you know, selling their console.

524
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,480
To be fair, it doesn't go down because somebody stole my credit card information.

525
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,000
It's never been down for 22 days.

526
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
True.

527
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,640
You know, there is a big difference than that, but I just think, you know, I do think selling

528
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,080
your PlayStation on this alone might be a little bit throwing out the baby with the

529
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
bathwater a little bit.

530
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,440
I mean, I, I, there could be that exclusive that comes out that makes you kind of want

531
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,720
to come back sorta.

532
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,400
I mean, if you, if you sell this and you mean it, then Hey, everybody has that right to

533
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,360
make those types of choices, but I just, I know too many people that sell systems only

534
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,560
to buy them back when the game they really want comes out, kind of like the 3DS, like

535
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,720
if you're selling a 3DS back already, you really should question why you bought one

536
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
in the first place.

537
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,800
I mean, that's really the underlying problem right now.

538
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,040
I mean, everybody knows the 3DS lineup right now is weak at best.

539
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,680
So, but there's going to be much better 3DS games by the end of the year between the Kid

540
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,320
Icarus, the assumed Mario game that's going to be announced at E3 and so forth.

541
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,800
There'll be more reasons to have it.

542
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,360
So why sell back a 3DS now just to buy one six months later?

543
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,120
So, but there are people, I mean, and there are going to be a certain percentage of people

544
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,160
that just feel so violated by this whole thing.

545
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,000
They've sworn off Sony and this could damage the PlayStation 4 later on.

546
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But I don't know.

547
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,240
I think it's a bit too early to really see the full ramifications.

548
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,000
I think it is so important more than ever this year to really see what Sony's bringing

549
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,280
out the big guns this year at E3.

550
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,680
But you know, I'm not exactly loving the fact that Sony's PlayStation network was down for

551
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,840
22 days, that my credit card information was stolen.

552
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,320
But at the same token, I kind of keep going back and forth on that crap, too.

553
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,560
They're like, oh, well, we have no evidence that it actually was stolen.

554
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Oh, well, but you still want to, you know, be sure and take all these safety precautions.

555
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,860
Oh, but we have really no evidence that's been stolen.

556
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,280
They're going back and forth on it.

557
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,840
Just like say, listen, it's been compromised and be done with it.

558
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,640
People will say, well, you know, there's really no evidence that they looked at it.

559
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
You know, they have the data.

560
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
They stole all of it.

561
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Who knows?

562
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
They maybe just deleted the file and said, pat themselves on the back and say, good job

563
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
me.

564
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
I hacked Sony.

565
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,600
So, um, I just, it's going to be interesting because later on this year you still have

566
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,320
some big, you know, The Last Guardian is a game that a lot of people are foaming at the

567
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
mouth over.

568
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,640
So it's very, it's going to be like, you know, will people forgive us if the games are good

569
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
enough?

570
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,040
It's going to be very, very interesting these next few months.

571
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,360
So anyhow, let's move on.

572
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,880
I think Dark Sakura has a little more to add to this whole retail angle.

573
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:42,160
Well, actually there is a notice that at least in the U S that, uh, diff 10 of the most popular

574
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:49,520
online titles that were for PlayStation three dropped by an average of 7.4%, um, basically

575
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,720
since the 20th of April.

576
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,560
And then the same 10 titles saw a 0.7% increase on Xbox three 60 for sales.

577
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,600
Also, um, uh, one of the UK retailers was reporting that they had double the amount

578
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,160
of PS threes being brought in and then half of those people picking up an Xbox three 60

579
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:18,240
that also sales of, uh, use titles have just completely been borked by PS three going to

580
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,520
sell like two coming in at four.

581
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
It's all fuzzy map.

582
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:34,400
It sounds like, well, at any rate, I, most people really are that fickle and it's, it's

583
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,560
really people in general I think are just so fickle that they're going to not put up

584
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,560
with any type of inconvenience when high real life doesn't always work out for you.

585
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,920
You're going to have to wait.

586
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,080
I didn't care.

587
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,880
Let's go to the chat room at chat dot orange lunch radio dot com for some feedback going

588
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
on right now.

589
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,360
A game guru in our chat room says red ring of death and PlayStation network being hacked

590
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,060
are only comparable in terms of showing the deficiencies that Microsoft and Sony has.

591
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Kind of interesting.

592
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,880
Yes, because Microsoft was always a software company and then they were getting into hardware.

593
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,880
But you know, in Microsoft though, I think that their response was a little bit better

594
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
than Sony's.

595
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,360
I mean, at least I granted they, I don't think they ever really admitted how many are affected.

596
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,400
Trust me, it's more than the 1% that they were quoting.

597
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,440
It's every single one, every single, every single one launch, every single one will be

598
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,000
absolutely be affected.

599
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,880
If you have one that's from the launch, you know, 2005 or whatever, and it's still working

600
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
today, that's a fluke.

601
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Trust me.

602
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,720
I, I know every single one will die a salacious pop responding to something you just said

603
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,760
a little bit ago.

604
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,240
I think Loki is under recognizing the huge dude broke contingent who only play black

605
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,800
ops battlefield, modern warfare all day.

606
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,240
And that's all they play.

607
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,680
And they're Sony geeks and never got into halo.

608
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Or I would add to that that the Blu-ray player was enticing.

609
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,760
I mean, like it or not, the Blu-ray factor being in the PlayStation three is still selling

610
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,560
a lot of those over Xbox three six to the dude broke contingent that salacious pop brings

611
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
up.

612
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,000
Not the audience that would be listening to this show, but the people that are like, Oh,

613
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,840
this thing plays Blu-rays and it plays modern warfare.

614
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Cool.

615
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,480
You know, well, first of all, your Blu-ray player will still work and it's back up.

616
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,800
So what's the problem?

617
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,580
Oh, those people that it took my credit card info.

618
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,080
So you gave them your credit card info.

619
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,960
Well, on top of that, just call the bank and change your shit.

620
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,800
You know, a little inconvenience for your own security.

621
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Sorry.

622
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
You're going to have to deal with it.

623
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,800
You're going to end up, uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says, I don't know, call me crazy, but

624
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,460
I'd rather have my three 60 red ring of death than my private information stolen.

625
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
That's just me.

626
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,320
If you say it's the same, then you obviously don't know what it's like to have your credit

627
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,040
card or identity stolen.

628
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,240
Uh, I still don't give a shit because if somebody tries to use my number, guess what?

629
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,320
We'll call and cancel the card and then they'll trace it back to whoever did it.

630
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,760
Don't care.

631
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Really don't care.

632
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,120
Well, it's going to be, I mean, if that happens, you're going to care when it happens.

633
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,800
If it happens at a bad time, but it's not gonna affect my credit.

634
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,540
It's not going to affect my finances.

635
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
It will.

636
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,580
All the funds will be frozen and I'll get a new card and hopefully they'll catch whoever

637
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
did it.

638
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Other than that.

639
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Don't give a shit.

640
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Yeah.

641
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
And I said this a couple of weeks before on the show.

642
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,860
If somebody were to use this credit card information has been stolen, you're really an idiot and

643
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,560
you're just asking to, uh, get caught for this whole thing.

644
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,040
I mean, the FBI is on this now, you know, they're just waiting for someone to fuck this

645
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,420
up and give away how this all, you know, kind of happened.

646
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:48,200
So and also the amount of information they actually got, um, you know, it's going to

647
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,120
take them forever to parse through that stuff anyways.

648
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,460
So yeah, there is a, there is the risks that your identity might be stolen or something

649
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,600
like that, but it's, I think it's very unlikely even even still, I think they'll catch them

650
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,640
before they even come close to parsing through all the data that's on there.

651
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I agree with this comment in our chat room.

652
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
Defective candy at chat, that orange sounds radio.com says, if someone tries to use my

653
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,460
credit card, guess what sucks to be them.

654
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
I'm broke.

655
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:27,440
I was just thinking that, you know, I really, I really, okay, wasting time freaking out

656
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,520
over this is really exactly just that.

657
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,320
Wasting time.

658
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,640
All you're doing is working yourself up.

659
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,500
You selling your PlayStation three is going to mean you're not going to be able to play

660
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
whatever that is.

661
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,960
It's going to come out later and then you're going to have to spend more money to get another

662
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,280
one if you want to play it badly enough.

663
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,360
So in the end, lacking patience just makes you a loser.

664
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
That's it.

665
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,320
Well, but I, at the same time, I can understand where somebody is going to sell their PlayStation

666
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
three back over this.

667
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
I really do.

668
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,600
But I just would say, think ahead cause you don't want to do something reactive only to

669
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,240
get sweetened back by Sony later on.

670
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,000
We also still don't know what they plan to do to kind of wrong the right or excuse me,

671
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
right?

672
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Wrong.

673
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The right, right?

674
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
The wrong.

675
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,600
And uh, you know what they're going to give as part of this, I guess you could see severance

676
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,760
package or whatever to kind of come back to the place.

677
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Wait, wait, wait.

678
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
You don't know.

679
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,960
Didn't you see the party look in Kaz's eyes?

680
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,200
It's obvious that he's going to throw one hell of a party.

681
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,160
That guy is a party animal.

682
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,080
And again, I, all I know, if I was thinking of selling my PlayStation three back, I'd

683
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,720
kind of be waiting until after E3 to make sure I really want to do it.

684
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,720
I'm not selling my fucking PS3 back because it's a fully backwards compatible PS3 with

685
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,360
the 500 gig hard drive in it that I don't play on the PlayStation network and hardly

686
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,480
ever buy games for.

687
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,540
So you know, I'm content with it.

688
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,040
I use it for Blu-rays.

689
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Great.

690
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
You know what?

691
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,000
If there's a Sony game that really is awesome that I have to have, I can get it.

692
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,720
But for everything else that's multi-platform, you better believe it.

693
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,320
I'm getting in on the Xbox 360 because that's just what I play more.

694
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,640
It's more convenient for me.

695
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
PS3 sucked up to the front TV.

696
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,160
Nelly wants to play Animal Crossing still.

697
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,440
So, you know, all right.

698
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,360
I feel like it's been PlayStation network all the time for the past three weeks.

699
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,060
Believe it or not, there is news in other parts of the gaming world and I think it's

700
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,400
time we took a trip there.

701
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
How about Xbox?

702
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,200
Let's talk about something going on in the 360 world, Loki.

703
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,860
Well, remember they were beta testing an update that's gonna change kind of the disk format

704
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,860
a little bit.

705
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:44,560
They're gonna allow developers to use another gigabyte of space that was dedicated for like

706
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,640
a video partition that basically says Xbox.

707
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,700
It's a little swirl logo thing that lets you know, hey, dumbass, that's not a DVD movie.

708
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,240
It is an Xbox game.

709
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,340
But you know what?

710
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,560
I think most people can figure out that it's an Xbox game.

711
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,200
They don't need a little video that shows that.

712
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,000
So get that out of the way and you have more space for storing stuff.

713
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,400
So along with that, there's also gonna be, you know, some other updates including PayPal.

714
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,240
It's coming on May 19th, which is interesting.

715
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,280
You'll be able to use your PayPal account to add funds for buying an Xbox Live Marketplace

716
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
materials and whatnot.

717
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,360
Extremely interesting in light of everything that's going on at Sony, that you can kind

718
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,800
of use a middleman now.

719
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,240
Instead of having to give your information directly to Microsoft, you could use a, for

720
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,380
better or worse, trusted payment delivery source, although I don't know if giving your

721
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,080
info to PayPal is any better or worse than giving it to Microsoft, to be honest.

722
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,400
And then Avatar Connect, that's coming May 27th.

723
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,220
That's the, you know, program that you can chat with your friends and, you know, use

724
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,440
the connect to move your avatar around, kind of like a talk show almost.

725
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,360
This sounds kind of weird to me because don't they have a video chat program as it is right

726
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
now?

727
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,440
They do, but you can't wave around as your avatar.

728
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Okay.

729
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,000
So this is for people who don't want to be seen as themselves.

730
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They want to be seen as their avatar online in chat.

731
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes.

732
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,100
So this is for like pedophiles and ugly people like, no, I mean, no offense to the ugly people

733
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,960
out there, but like, right?

734
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,480
Like why would you just use video chat?

735
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Yeah.

736
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,080
Um, and then of course, you know, as I mentioned, uh, the, uh, XGD3, uh, that's the new format

737
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,120
that's going to be for the disks.

738
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,480
The other thing is, of course, they're going to be adding some more copy protection.

739
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,320
It's also going to be flashing all of those people that have flash modded drives.

740
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,480
It's going to be flashing those drives back to their stock firmwares and going to be,

741
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,280
um, fixing it in a way where you can't change it.

742
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,560
Well, you can't easily change it.

743
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,240
We'll get to that a little bit later, but a neat, you know, that also saves me a step

744
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,880
because I have one flash system still that we, it was leftover from, I just didn't want

745
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,160
to bother the flash it back and now I don't have to, they're going to do it for me.

746
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Awesome.

747
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,880
I, what do you think about this news of what's coming out in the Xbox three spring update?

748
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,000
I mean, usually these updates are pretty exciting.

749
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,640
There's at least one little tidbit in there where you're like, Oh, that's going to be

750
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,200
awesome to have like the, I don't know, like the USB storage or whatever, but this time

751
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,720
around I'm looking at the updates going, eh, none of this, I mean, PayPal, okay.

752
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,040
I don't know who would use that, but not me.

753
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,440
Uh, I'd use it.

754
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,000
I mean, if I was buying a lot of content on Xbox live, I'd use it because I sell a lot

755
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
of shit on eBay.

756
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,040
So I have, I usually, when I'm not dumping my funds back into my bank account, I usually

757
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,680
have quite a bit sitting in my PayPal account.

758
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I guess I can get that.

759
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,460
See, I don't, I don't really use PayPal like that.

760
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,880
Like I use PayPal to pay for Skype and that's about it.

761
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,720
And that's cause I, we've been using Skype ever since they were like a company based

762
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,160
in the UK and it was actually very easy to do the international funds through PayPal.

763
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,360
Um, so that's why I have a PayPal account.

764
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
I don't use it for anything.

765
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,200
I also use, I use it a lot for just buying stuff online.

766
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,520
I buy a lot of stuff on eBay.

767
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,320
I buy a lot of stuff like subscriptions for things.

768
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,960
I'll pay for that.

769
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,000
That makes sense though, that for those people that actually use PayPal as a wallet from

770
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,360
like eBay and things like that, that is kind of a neat way to be able to pay for the games.

771
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,440
It's online for eBay and Dan uses it for his RC cars.

772
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
All right, I get it.

773
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,840
I guess that is a little bit more exciting, but I don't know.

774
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
But once again.

775
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Let's talk about me again.

776
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
I am not excited.

777
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
There's nothing in it for me.

778
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Yeah.

779
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,240
See, I don't buy a lot of download content anymore for games other than like maybe like

780
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,960
a Grand Theft Auto or something like that.

781
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,500
I probably wouldn't buy, you know, download content for a lot of things.

782
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,360
I may or may not have bought Dan Central songs the other day.

783
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:59,760
You know, I have certain hardware configurations in various places that facilitate the ability

784
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,720
to not have to purchase that stuff and yet enjoy the full range of content.

785
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,680
I think that's the place where I can say that.

786
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,280
But yeah, I really don't buy a lot.

787
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
Mainly because, you know, look at what I'm playing each week, Grand Theft Auto, Grand

788
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto.

789
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,760
I mean, there's not any new content coming out for that, so there's nothing for me to

790
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
buy.

791
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
DJ Hero.

792
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
You know, Grand Theft Auto 5.

793
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
You know, 1.5.

794
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
Yeah.

795
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Hell yeah.

796
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
1.5.

797
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Anything they put out, I'll buy.

798
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,360
I mean, that's just, you know, the way it is.

799
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,080
All right.

800
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,560
Let me move on to a story about something that maybe you'll be using your PayPal money

801
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
to download.

802
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
I don't know.

803
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,360
Sega has been an ESRB rating that's come out for the Genesis game Monster World 4 coming

804
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,200
out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

805
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,840
Now, that kind of spilled the news a little early.

806
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,520
Sega of Europe actually confirmed that they are bringing the game over to PlayStation

807
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,640
Network and Wii Virtual Console.

808
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,860
So odd that they left Xbox Live Arcade out of that, but whatever.

809
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,640
Maybe something's happening in the future.

810
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,800
I don't know.

811
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,000
There's gonna be a vintage collection that actually comes out later in the year.

812
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,960
You know, they've been milking those Genesis games for all their worth and there's still

813
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,680
people that will pay five bucks a game for it, so whatever.

814
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,040
This collection is gonna have Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Revenge of Shinobi, Alex Kidd

815
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,200
in Miracle World, Wonder Boy in Monster World.

816
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,480
Now, all those games have already come out on the Virtual Console here in North America.

817
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,800
But the interesting thing about this, Monster World 4, it was never actually officially

818
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,920
released on a console outside of Japan.

819
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,080
And get this.

820
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,020
It's gonna be localized as a part of this collection.

821
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:47,320
So Sega is actually localizing this ages-old, what is this, 94, I think, game?

822
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Wasn't this first game?

823
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
Don't say that, Rob.

824
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
It was, uh, sorry.

825
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,680
That's when I graduated.

826
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
I don't write the news.

827
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
I just report it.

828
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,400
As, uh, trolls would say on the internet, Sega does but intend don't.

829
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,120
In other words, localizing an old game that maybe fans might want to play just because

830
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
they can.

831
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
That's the best zing I've heard on a show.

832
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Hey, Joe Aniki came out.

833
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Don't say that.

834
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
What's that?

835
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Joe Aniki came out.

836
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
But that's not a Nintendo game.

837
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
They didn't translate it.

838
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Yeah, it wasn't Nintendo.

839
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,280
They didn't, yeah, when Sin and Punishment, the original came out, they didn't bother

840
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
to translate it.

841
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,800
I mean, a lot of those games didn't need translation, but this is really the first time that they've

842
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,840
gone back and actually are gonna translate a game.

843
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,480
Now, I can't imagine Monster World 4 has the epic dialogue of a role-playing game, but

844
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,040
it's probably got, what, it's kind of a Mario-y style game, right?

845
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,460
Sort of a side-scrolling adventure game, right?

846
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,560
So it's probably got a decent amount of dialogue.

847
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,720
It's kind of neat that they're localizing it.

848
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,920
But at the same time, if I have to buy this whole big collection with all these other

849
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,040
Genesis games just to get it, I don't know.

850
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,240
And I gotta be honest, well, I don't know, I hear Monster World 4 is really, really good

851
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,080
and I'm missing a lot by not playing it, but my desire to go and pay money for this old

852
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,000
94 game, I don't know, I just, I'm not, like, super excited about it.

853
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,760
I just think there's other stuff in the gaming world my money would be spent on.

854
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,440
But I guess I'll wait and see when this comes out.

855
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,640
Maybe everybody will be like, you have to play it, it's great, and we were missing so

856
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,720
much before.

857
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,880
A good game is still a good game at the end of the day, right?

858
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
So.

859
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Alright, moving on.

860
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,660
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

861
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,760
I have other news related to Disney, although I, okay, this is, I'm first gonna point out

862
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,880
something that I totally loathe that this article does.

863
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,840
Okay, the article says, Disney Studio coughs up 3 million for violating kiddie gamer's

864
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,320
privacy.

865
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,520
But Disney didn't do it.

866
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,120
It was titles that had been acquired before Disney acquired Playdom, which is their online

867
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,760
kids gaming thing.

868
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,840
So to say Disney did it, yeah, Disney may have accepted all the liability, but it wasn't

869
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,280
Disney that did it, and I hate when titles are misleading like that, so.

870
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:57,280
But at any rate, Playdom, which is the Disney social game studios, paid 3 million dollars

871
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,300
as a settlement for titles that were there before Playdom acquired, I'm sorry, that were

872
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,440
acquired by Playdom before Disney acquired it, were collecting kids' ages and email addresses

873
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,080
without parental consent.

874
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,740
It was posted without parental consent.

875
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
So Disney coughed up the cash for it.

876
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,440
And isn't, there is some type of law where like if you're under 13.

877
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
It's COPA.

878
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Yeah.

879
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Yeah.

880
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,480
So basically, um, you know, they have to have consent to be able to do something like that,

881
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,400
and it was a game called Pony Stars, which was like a My Little Pony game.

882
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,800
Oh shit, my information probably got compromised.

883
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,200
Oh Rob.

884
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,120
But basically, these were all done by Acclaim.

885
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,440
At the time, it was under Acclaim's management.

886
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,880
Uh, the Curse of Acclaim.

887
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah.

888
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
And then Playdom bought out Acclaim.

889
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
So.

890
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,600
But actually, the former Acclaim CEO, Howard Marks, is also being named in the case.

891
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
Oh snap.

892
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:05,160
So I would say, uh, you know, whoever holds whatever rights are left, you know, Disney

893
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,240
needs to go after them.

894
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,480
Um, it's really tricky, especially when you're talking about games marketed towards kids.

895
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,460
Like a lot of kids, you know what game comes to mind for me is that Smurfs Village game

896
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,760
on iOS has taken a lot of heat and that's a Capcom game, if I'm not mistaken.

897
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,000
The Smurfs Village game, because of how easy it is for kids to get sucked into that game

898
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and buy the little Smurf Berries, like, you know, it's just touch, touch, touch to do

899
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
it.

900
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,280
And you buy those, like you've heard these stories of kids spending hundreds of dollars

901
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,740
on these dumb ass Smurf Berries to make things grow faster in the game, but you know, a lot

902
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:42,880
of 10 year olds who don't have a true concept of money don't understand that.

903
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
I think back to when-

904
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,160
And parents that don't have a concept of parenting don't understand that their kids are buying

905
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,240
stuff through their phone.

906
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,520
I think it's funny though, cause I think back to a time when I was probably like 14 or 15

907
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,160
and I was on Prodigy and Prodigy used to charge for using chat rooms and one month I ran up

908
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,280
like a $90 bill in the chat room or something like that and my mother, oh God, I never heard

909
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
the end of it.

910
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
You guys never heard the end of it.

911
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah, we did the same thing in Prodigy, but it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily because of

912
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,800
the, um, the chat room.

913
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,080
It was because, um, the number that it picked to dial was long distance.

914
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,080
No.

915
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,080
Yeah.

916
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,080
That's not good.

917
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Love dialing.

918
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:32,600
See, I used to have the hookup on AOL back in the day because I dialed in on an 800 number.

919
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,080
I thought you had to pay for that.

920
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,080
And had a free account.

921
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,840
I was gonna say, I thought you had to pay for the 800 number.

922
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,680
I was a chat room host for Cartoon Network.

923
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,540
It was almost impossible not to have a free account through AOL because you'd threaten

924
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:50,240
to cancel or, you know, they'd just send you another 72, you know, day trial or whatever.

925
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,240
Just a ridiculous amount of 720 hour trial.

926
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,080
That's what it was, you know, oh, wait, that's 30 days.

927
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
Awesome.

928
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:07,700
Uh, yeah, but I'm referring to back when it was like $3 an hour or something.

929
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,480
Back when it had just gotten out of DOS.

930
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,560
Rama in the chat room says, Sky, if she didn't beat you with the belt, you got off lucky.

931
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,560
LOL.

932
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,560
No.

933
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
All the abuse in my household was always emotional, never physical.

934
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Alright.

935
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,740
That's not abuse.

936
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,520
Let's move on.

937
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,720
Let's move on and talk about release dates and what's coming out to a store near you

938
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,800
depending on where you live.

939
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,480
We'll start with the US.

940
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Not much this week.

941
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,200
LA Noire on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 being the biggest title of the week.

942
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,920
It's kind of a big title, right?

943
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,320
Yeah, just a little bit.

944
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,960
The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings on PC, coming out from Atari.

945
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,560
The First Templar on Xbox 360.

946
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,040
Spongebob Squigglepants for the 3DS, this is the game that's sort of like Warioware,

947
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,620
but here it's terrible, so, you know, keep that in mind.

948
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,240
Another terrible title for the 3DS.

949
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,240
Cake Man-

950
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
What a shock!

951
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
Yeah, shocker.

952
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,960
Cake Mania Main Street for the Nintendo DS, I'm sure it's all like the other Cake Mania

953
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
games.

954
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,440
Fable 3 on PC this week.

955
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,440
And that's it.

956
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,140
Alright, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there.

957
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,960
You get your version of Portal 2 this week on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, those

958
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,060
coming out on May the 19th.

959
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,160
And yeah, those are like localized versions for Japan.

960
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,200
I don't know if they have all new voice actors or if it uses subtitles or what, but yeah,

961
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,400
they're getting their own version of Portal 2 so they can get in on the fun that we're

962
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
having over here.

963
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,460
Again, that's on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

964
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,200
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week, excuse me, is a price reduction, not

965
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,560
a new game, but FIFA Soccer 11 moves into the best hit series from EA, it's like it's

966
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,360
a big price reduction in Japan this week.

967
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,400
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nuttin' this week, what a surprise, the Nintendo 3DS Dead

968
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,140
or Alive Dimensions finally gets its release this week in Japan, so I'm sure we'll be hearing

969
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:07,460
some reports on that game and how it turned out, because we'll be getting it soon enough.

970
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:14,560
Also on the 3DS over there, Animal Resort, Dobutsen o Suikuro comes out, and Tom Clancy's

971
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,120
Ghost Recon Shadow Wars also comes out.

972
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,480
Trying to look at this Animal Resort, and honestly, when I see the box, the first thing

973
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,580
I think of, honest, Africa.

974
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,120
Because it looks just like that game.

975
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,240
Who's putting out Animal Resort?

976
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,280
Animal Resort is being put out by, who is this, AQ Interactive is putting out the game,

977
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,920
but look at this, there's elephants you can take pictures of, and hippopotamus, it looks

978
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,200
like you feed them, because there's little items there on the bottom, and it looks like

979
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,520
this guy is dragging a type of fruit to feed the hippopotamus, but this is adorable, there's

980
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,680
apparently penguins in this, so now I kind of want it, to be honest.

981
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Looks pretty good, I mean, for a 3DS title, the graphics are pretty good.

982
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,200
It's kind of an interesting twist on Nintendogs, I bet what this is, is it's kind of like Nintendzoo.

983
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,400
Maybe it's like Animonsnap.

984
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,600
Well I was just wondering if, the only reason I asked who made it, is because there's a

985
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,840
title coming from Ubisoft called Zoo Mania that looks similar to that, and I'm wondering

986
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,320
if it's actually the exact same game.

987
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,160
Perhaps, we'll have to look that up.

988
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,900
On the Sony PSP this week on May the 19th, Akiba's Trip comes out.

989
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,560
This is, uh, oh what do they do, it's a trip.

990
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,040
It's a game where you get people to strip.

991
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,840
No you don't get people to strip, I don't, what?

992
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:38,340
Yes, you, by fighting them, they will remove, their clothes will be removed.

993
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,840
I'm serious, there's an article about it.

994
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,880
Oh my god, that is what's really happening in this picture, it looks like she's wearing

995
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,440
cat ears and no pants.

996
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,200
Now, not completely naked because, you know, it's a PSP title, but yes, that's exactly

997
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
what happens.

998
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,280
They do have porn titles for PSP.

999
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,440
Yeah, but those are video titles, they're not actual game titles.

1000
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
Well.

1001
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,960
No, there's games.

1002
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,680
They do not have fully-nude games on the PSP.

1003
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,600
Trust me, I've looked.

1004
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,840
The wife really wants one.

1005
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,000
Well no, they sell them on J-list.

1006
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,920
They're x-rated UMDs, that's what those are, but they don't have actual PSP games.

1007
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,120
I mean, come on, this is Japan we're talking about, they're very conservative when it comes

1008
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,480
to video games.

1009
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,480
Uh-huh.

1010
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,000
Alright, and then there's a few games that move into best hits on the PSP as well, including

1011
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,560
FIFA Soccer 11 and Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos, but that does it for your Japanese releases.

1012
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,560
Let's go to the UK.

1013
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
In the UK.

1014
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,000
Actually, as soon as I voice somebody in our chat room.

1015
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,600
Okay, in the UK we have on the 17th Fallout New Vegas, Honest Hearts, and The Witcher

1016
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:52,440
2, Assassins of Kings for PC, and a new beginning on the 20th, Dead or Alive Dimensions and

1017
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,240
L.A. Noire.

1018
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
And that's it.

1019
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Alright.

1020
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,700
Couple news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1021
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,080
What will it be this week?

1022
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,860
We'll find out in two more stories.

1023
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,800
So Microsoft had some money to spend and, you know, what did they decide to do?

1024
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,120
They bought Skype.

1025
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:16,640
So they bought Skype for $8.5 billion, and apparently they're gonna be, um, you know,

1026
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,920
Skype will be supported on Microsoft devices like the Xbox and Kinect, Windows Phone, and

1027
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,800
an array of other Windows devices, and also, of course, they announced that, um, you know,

1028
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,320
they'll still be supporting, you know, the platforms that it's on already, so, um, you

1029
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,880
know, the PSP and whatnot.

1030
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,880
And I guess this is also Skype users with Link, Outlook, and Xbox Live and other communities

1031
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:48,400
will be able to connect with Skype as well, so that's kind of neat.

1032
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,080
So I'm wondering now if we're gonna see, like, Windows with Skype, you know, built in as,

1033
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,680
you know, like a default program and stuff like that, or, you know, why this thing is

1034
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,480
kind of neat that they're gonna have Skype.

1035
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,000
I wonder if they're gonna do, like, the Avatar Kinect with Skype.

1036
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Maybe.

1037
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,920
Certainly this is gonna be coming to the 360 sooner rather than later.

1038
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm kind of surprised this isn't being rushed for the spring update, uh, because that's

1039
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
a pretty big addition.

1040
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,680
Like, I understand that, I guess right now, the Kinect video chat will work with Windows

1041
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Messenger, but I don't know anyone that uses Windows Messenger that's not also on an Xbox,

1042
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,060
so I don't know.

1043
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,840
But you know the interesting thing about this is we've been using Skype here at Orange

1044
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,480
Lounge Radio since before podcasting.

1045
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,240
I think we took our first Skype call probably in 03, however old Skype is, we were on that

1046
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,240
really early.

1047
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,680
So it's gonna be very, you know, we're pretty loyal to the program.

1048
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,080
I mean, until it, I don't know, steals our credit card information or something, we're

1049
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,160
not gonna go anywhere.

1050
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,000
Until it out parties Caz.

1051
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Exactly.

1052
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,320
I'm gonna be, it's gonna be very interesting because pretty soon we're gonna be able to

1053
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,880
invite phone calls from people on their Kinects to chat with the show.

1054
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,060
That's gonna be something.

1055
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,840
That is pretty something, except the only problem is you still can't stream the show

1056
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,120
onto the 360.

1057
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,120
Not yet.

1058
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,360
I wish there was something they would do about that.

1059
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:16,040
Not unless, you know, you have, I don't, no, you can't do it through Pandora or last, was

1060
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,120
it last FM that's on there or Pandora?

1061
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,240
I can't remember.

1062
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,440
Last FM's on there.

1063
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
Last FM.

1064
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
I don't think you can get it through there.

1065
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,800
I mean, you could hook it up to a PC, but what's the point?

1066
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,080
I mean, you know, if it's hooked up to a PC already, then you might as well just use the

1067
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
PC.

1068
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,880
Misty, who is one of our archive experts in our chat room says she knows we were taking

1069
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,520
them at least by episode 111, uh, which would have been 04.

1070
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:46,680
I'm pretty sure we were taking them before that, but yeah, so it was a while ago.

1071
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,040
Anyhow, um, be very curious to see what this kind of all pans out to.

1072
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,440
Do you think, a lot of people are saying they paid too much for Skype.

1073
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
What do you think?

1074
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,360
I don't know how much Skype is worth.

1075
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,640
It's worth nothing to me.

1076
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,320
I'm not paying for it.

1077
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:08,840
Uh, yeah, I mean, Skype doesn't really do ads and they're free, you know, it's, it's,

1078
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,320
they're going to have to add ads to it at some point I think, and I don't know how people

1079
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
are going to feel about that.

1080
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,160
Well, they have to have some, I mean, they're, they have, you know, the Skype out services

1081
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
and stuff like that.

1082
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,580
That's kind of neat, you know, um, and you know, if they're pushing the whole family

1083
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,580
angle and stuff.

1084
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:32,480
Hey, now you can call your friends on their phones and stuff like that or, I don't know.

1085
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,040
Alright well, the Level Up event was held by Namco Bandai this week and we want to go

1086
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,760
over some news from that event including, and this makes me very excited, a new Soul

1087
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,840
Calibur game was announced and I love the Soul Calibur series.

1088
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,560
So yeah, Soul Calibur 5 was announced this week, uh, that's pretty cool, that's going

1089
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,560
to be happening.

1090
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,700
Um, there was a little teaser trailer that was released, let me see if I can play a little

1091
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,120
bit of it here in the studio.

1092
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,120
Not a whole lot of characters showed up in there, but I think, like, nightmares in there

1093
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:04,840
and apparently there's a new character named Patroclus who's supposed to be the son of

1094
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,680
Sophitia and Rothian, so it could be interesting.

1095
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,520
The game is going to be out in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.

1096
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,280
It is set 17 years after the events of Soul Calibur 4.

1097
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,600
So yeah, I guess there's going to be quite a bit of roster revision going on there.

1098
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,840
Siegfried is also supposed to be in the game, uh, so, could be interesting.

1099
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,560
Uh, trailer won't load for me right now, YouTube's being kind of dumpy, being very slow.

1100
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,600
Has anyone else noticed that over the past few days, that it's just been running kind

1101
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,600
of like crap?

1102
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Uncertain files, yeah.

1103
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Yeah.

1104
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:48,880
So this is one of those certain files for sure.

1105
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,600
So this trailer is more like the opening cutscene that you would see in the game, probably.

1106
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,080
It doesn't really show a lot of gameplay.

1107
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,200
It's your very typical announcement trailer, but, uh, I'm looking forward to it.

1108
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,200
It's going to be awesome.

1109
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,120
I hope you still get to, like, make your own character and all that stuff.

1110
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,480
Yeah, I actually didn't play any of the make your own character ones.

1111
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,760
Very interesting tweet that actually came out in response to this.

1112
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,880
The game director Daishi Odoshima actually tweeted this.

1113
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,560
I asked the company if we can call the game Soul Edge 2, but they said no.

1114
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,760
So that might give you an idea about where this is going also, because remember the first

1115
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,640
Soul Calibur game, if you will, was really Soul Edge.

1116
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,240
Also news coming out of the event, Tekken Cross Street Fighter hasn't even started yet.

1117
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,920
Keep in mind there's two games being made.

1118
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,920
There's Street Fighter Cross Tekken and Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

1119
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,560
Apparently Namco Bandai said they haven't even really started work on Tekken Cross Street

1120
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Fighter yet.

1121
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,600
So yeah, interesting.

1122
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,480
The quote from producer Katushiro Harada said, quote, we really haven't started on Tekken

1123
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,760
Cross Street Fighter.

1124
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,920
Things are going well with Street Fighter Cross Tekken and we'll have more on that at

1125
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
E3.

1126
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,320
We hope you look forward to that.

1127
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,440
So I don't know, maybe they're spacing the games out a little bit.

1128
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,440
Kind of interesting.

1129
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,160
By the way, speaking of Street Fighter Cross Tekken, a new teaser came out for it this

1130
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,640
week and it shows Kami.

1131
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,240
So Kami will be in the game, which really doesn't surprise anyone, I'm sure.

1132
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,440
Some other little bits and pieces that came out of that as well.

1133
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,860
Ace Combat Assault Horizons coming out October 11th in the US and the 14th in Europe.

1134
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,920
There's a new CG feature film based on Tekken called Tekken Blood Vengeance.

1135
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,440
Tales of Graces and Tales of Abyss also coming out on the PS3 and the 3DS respectively.

1136
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,360
And wait for it, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact coming out on the PSP because

1137
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,120
your life just wasn't complete without another Naruto game.

1138
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,400
I also know your lives just aren't complete unless we do the segment here on the show

1139
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,860
called the Classic Game of the Week.

1140
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,080
Every week we take a trip down memory lane where Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault

1141
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,880
and finds a game that she thinks you kids need to be playing.

1142
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,440
This is one some of you might remember.

1143
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,960
This isn't too old.

1144
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
No.

1145
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,680
And funny enough, totally ironically, I had no idea Dark Sakura was going to pick this

1146
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,680
game.

1147
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,200
I was playing this last night.

1148
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,200
Crazy.

1149
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,080
Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1150
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,080
Umjama-lami.

1151
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,080
Umjama-lami.

1152
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,080
Okay.

1153
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,340
And I put in the one I thought was your favorite.

1154
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:18,200
This is my favorite song in the soundtrack.

1155
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:27,600
Anyway, Umjama-lami, yeah, and I did cover Parappa series, but I'm doing Umjama-lami

1156
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
anyway.

1157
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,600
I don't care.

1158
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,520
Umjama-lami was put out by Nana On'Sha and Namco in the arcade, well Namco in the arcade.

1159
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,080
Sorry the music died behind you.

1160
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,920
It's just YouTube's failing us tonight.

1161
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,920
Sorry guys.

1162
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,920
It's being uber fail.

1163
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:47,200
Um, at any rate, it came out in Japan on March 18th, 1999 and in North America on August

1164
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,200
17th, 1999.

1165
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,760
And yeah, it plays like Parappa, pretty much.

1166
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:58,240
Um, Namco released the arcade version and it had a guitar controller so that, um, you

1167
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
could get the sensation of playing a guitar.

1168
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,400
I mean, it's very similar to Guitar Freaks.

1169
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,560
We've seen one of these machines, remember?

1170
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,560
I do.

1171
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,560
I do remember the machine.

1172
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,560
I had to like get on my knees to play it.

1173
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,840
Get your minds out of the gutter, people.

1174
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,800
It was made for kids and I'm a little tall.

1175
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,680
Anyway, it's like a Simon Says sort of thing, so, you know, they, their characters will

1176
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,920
do something and then you do something and you have to basically repeat whatever it tells

1177
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,680
you to do.

1178
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,920
And so through the game, you have a Chop Chop Master Onion from Parappa and that's where

1179
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,480
you get Dojo Casino.

1180
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,480
It's all in the mind.

1181
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,000
And she goes, yeah, my guitar is in my mind.

1182
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,520
And then, um, but the whole thing is basically Lammy trying to get to her concert with her

1183
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,120
group Milk Can at the Chop Chop Master Arena.

1184
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,560
And so she has to put out a fire and babysit babies with Kathy Pillar, which is a song,

1185
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,760
and then fly an airplane and then chop down a tree to make a new guitar.

1186
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:07,800
And then she actually, um, well, gets sent to an island, but in the Japanese version,

1187
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,360
she's actually, she actually dies and goes to hell.

1188
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,440
And I found a movie file of that to play for everybody.

1189
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,840
Oh, that's my cue, isn't it?

1190
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
Sorry.

1191
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,840
Yes, it is, Rob.

1192
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,840
Here we go.

1193
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,400
And this is where Rob stops texting on his iPhone.

1194
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Hold on.

1195
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Let me bring this up.

1196
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:38,640
Here, you can have this too.

1197
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
Distortion.

1198
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Thank you.

1199
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:47,640
Two more minutes and I'm history.

1200
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,880
She's running in front of traffic.

1201
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,880
These interludes were so bad.

1202
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,800
So it's not the banana peel that PJ Berry is eating the bananas.

1203
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,800
Cracks her head and dies.

1204
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,960
Stupid PJ Berry.

1205
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
Stupid fat bear.

1206
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,960
Phew.

1207
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,960
It was a dream.

1208
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
Am I dead?

1209
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
No, bitch.

1210
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,960
You're 2D.

1211
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,960
Is this hell?

1212
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:30,200
That's what I think every time I show up to this show, too.

1213
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,320
What a stupid game.

1214
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,320
And then the credits roll.

1215
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,320
This is great.

1216
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:58,400
And then she goes on stage with, uh, Teriyaki Yoko.

1217
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,440
Yeah, and that whole thing was cut out of the U.S. version.

1218
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,240
Yeah, they had her showing up on a desert island.

1219
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,200
And so it went into the whole Vital Idol song.

1220
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:21,480
And where she gets faxed back to life instead of teleported via fax from the island.

1221
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,480
So yeah.

1222
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,760
Um, now I will tell you something, because I'll tell you why I picked this, is that Dan

1223
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,020
and I discussed this today.

1224
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:35,520
And I was saying how I had a demo disc of this, and it had all of the stuff in the game

1225
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,380
just locked out.

1226
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:43,120
And it had the original, you know, because in Time Trap Master Onion's song it said,

1227
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,320
you could play in hell and go far.

1228
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:50,600
And it's on the demo disc, not on, anyway, but all this was left in in Europe and Japan.

1229
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,760
But in the U.S. people had to get a stick up their butt and have her go to an island.

1230
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:02,120
So anyway, um, you have four different ranks, you have good, you have bad, and you have

1231
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,200
awful, and if you get a little awful, then your song ends.

1232
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,320
And the quality of the music changes also with each, each one too.

1233
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,680
But now you can also get cool, and so you basically freestyle unless you, uh, really

1234
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,680
screw up.

1235
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,800
But if you keep cool by the end of the song, you'll get a cool ending to the level.

1236
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:24,840
And, but if it flashes good, then you go back into normal play.

1237
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,240
Like, uh, for this one, you know, if you get cool, then Terry Akioka goes, okay, you can

1238
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,840
go by yourself, and then you're in this tunnel.

1239
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:35,760
But if, uh, you, you drop back down to good, he goes, okay, well you need me after all.

1240
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,600
But you also get different, um, uh, morphers to your sound.

1241
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,840
You get a flanger, you get a harmonizer, you get the wah-wah, you get distortion and a

1242
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
reverb.

1243
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,600
And then there are actually some different, uh, items that you get, like, in order, it's

1244
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:56,680
a fire siren, a caterpillar rattle, um, Captain Fuss and Pepper's false teeth, who was the,

1245
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,680
uh, head-banging pilot in, uh, I think stage four.

1246
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
Uh, you get-

1247
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,680
Oh god, I love that stage.

1248
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,680
Can I play that music?

1249
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,680
Sure.

1250
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,680
That music was awesome.

1251
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,600
You know, I could never beat that unless I did it cool.

1252
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,600
Really?

1253
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,600
That level?

1254
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,600
Uh-huh.

1255
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,600
But I could always get it to go cool.

1256
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:36,760
That's a trap level.

1257
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,720
This person's going for cool, too, so, anyhow.

1258
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Yeah.

1259
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:50,720
Um, and so you also got, um, like, a, uh, a thievertime, so that if, you know, when

1260
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:56,360
you enter a level after it's been completed, it brings up a chocolate screen with symbols,

1261
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:02,040
and if you input everything in the right order, when the level is cool, the screen goes really

1262
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,680
crazy, and symbols fly all over the place, and then you can hit those buttons repeatedly

1263
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,320
and get uber points.

1264
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:15,840
So yeah, the, um, the arcade version was called Um Jammer Lamy Now, and it had a guitar controller,

1265
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,560
and it had, um, the buttons for triangle, circle, x, and square are strummers in the

1266
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,720
middle of the guitar, and the L button is a slider at the top of the guitar, and there's

1267
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:30,240
a scratch disk at the bottom, um, that's, instead of the R button, and, but it's really

1268
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:38,080
the same as the, uh, home version, and there, uh, is, uh, an ability to play with Parappa

1269
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,080
in that, too.

1270
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:44,120
So you've got Lamy mode, and then you have your co-op, which is Lamy and Ramy, who is

1271
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:51,760
the dark version of Lamy, then you have versus, which is Lamy versus Ramy, you have solo Parappa,

1272
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,240
you have Lamy and Parappa, and then you have, um, versus Lamy and Parappa, and then you

1273
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,240
have a special mode.

1274
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:05,800
So, um, it's, uh, basically you can just listen to any of the songs in good, bad, awful, or

1275
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:11,560
cool mode, and, of course, you could also do that if you had the PSX play a little program

1276
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,840
and could rip all your files, but, uh, I digress.

1277
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,880
So, um, you also had, uh, yeah, like I said, there were the, the changes.

1278
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:27,120
Now, I, I brought up the hell changes, um, but for, uh, Paul Chuck in stage five, instead

1279
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,600
of chopping trees down for the fun, it was changed knowing that we're here for the fun,

1280
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:40,920
and then, of course, Terry Akioko, like I said, and, uh, Lamy is actually wearing a

1281
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:49,160
camouflage t-shirt and, uh, has jungle makeup to show that she's in the jungle, ooh, and

1282
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:56,600
then, um, also, uh, this, the scene before stage seven has Catty Cat and Masan riding

1283
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:03,520
a camel, and, uh, the ending credits is, uh, an instrumental version of Keep Your Head

1284
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,080
Up, and then Chop Chop Master Onion's music was, of course, changed.

1285
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,880
The demo, like I said, has everything in it, and then there was, uh, there was three soundtracks

1286
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,920
came out, one called Make It Sweet, which is all the music done by Milk Can, and, uh,

1287
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:24,120
there was called Ice Cream, which was remixed versions of the songs, and then, um, and that

1288
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:29,600
was with, uh, Dread Fox's Parappa, and then the whole original soundtrack, which I've

1289
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,600
got somewhere.

1290
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:38,080
So yeah, the game is super awesome, it's super fun, and, uh, it's, uh, really great, but

1291
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,720
I still think it's stupid that they had to change it.

1292
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,920
In fact, uh, Game Vortex, uh, criticized it, and I think this is the best way of saying

1293
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,760
something that said it was an unfortunate thing, and said, did I miss some logical leap?

1294
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,640
I think our kids can handle such a basic concept as hell.

1295
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,640
The end.

1296
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,080
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Umm Jamma Lemmy.

1297
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,360
You know, and I was none the wiser when I first played this game, because, you know,

1298
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,960
I wasn't really following the import gaming scene, you know.

1299
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:09,820
See, I had bought a certain game, actually, it was at Anime Expo, and I talked my way

1300
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,360
into a demo disc, because I was so excited about this game.

1301
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,360
Nice.

1302
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,360
Alright.

1303
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,280
Well, there it is, your classic game of the week, uh, anyhow, we, uh, are gonna take a

1304
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,920
quick break here live, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1305
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,840
We got plenty more to come in Part B tonight, including some other new game announcements.

1306
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:31,360
Uh, in rapid fire news tonight, uh, a big arcade collection's been announced, also,

1307
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,640
uh, a big popular beta has been announced for later this year, it's gonna be huge.

1308
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,400
Uh, also we're gonna get into some more lawsuits in Part B, some Portal 2 news, and, uh, yeah,

1309
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:46,760
some more, uh, localization, or maybe not, just, uh, unlocalized games that you can still

1310
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,760
buy locally.

1311
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,360
That'll make sense in a little bit.

1312
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,960
Anyhow, we're gonna take a break, but stay tuned, guys, we'll be back with more of Orange

1313
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:01,240
Lounge Radio.

1314
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,720
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1315
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:09,600
We are live with our 413th episode on this Sunday, May the 15th of 2011, and of course,

1316
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,620
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

1317
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,440
Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com.

1318
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,640
So we're just coming out on a music break, and some discussions there in Part A about,

1319
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,600
uh, PlayStation Network, of course, coming back online, although, I don't know, it's

1320
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,280
still a little spotty for some people.

1321
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,920
Monster World 4 getting a localization finally, and of course the big story this week about

1322
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,680
Microsoft buying Skype.

1323
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,600
Uh, I noticed in studio here that Loki is playing Portal 2.

1324
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,800
It looks very nice on your laptop, I gotta say, the graphics for that are, uh, pretty

1325
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,800
smooth.

1326
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,240
You must have a pretty powerful little laptop there, I didn't realize.

1327
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
Yes, I do.

1328
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,240
Nice.

1329
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
So, are you enjoying the game so far?

1330
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
Yeah.

1331
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,640
I'm not too far into it, from what I can tell, so, awesome.

1332
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,680
Even though you had the ending ruined for you already, but that's alright.

1333
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,200
I haven't had it ruined a long time ago.

1334
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,360
You kinda like the spoiler stuff anyway, so, usually.

1335
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,680
Yeah, I don't care.

1336
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,520
Alright, uh, we don't just do Orange Lounge Radio, all of us hosts here, we do have some

1337
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,020
side projects, we usually like to take this opportunity to plug those projects.

1338
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,560
If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, you might enjoy these other great shows.

1339
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,560
Dark Sakura?

1340
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:16,960
I do Comic Insanity with, uh, Tiara, also known as Mara & Marvel, and Dan Shadow, and

1341
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,480
we have a new one coming up on Tuesday with our new format, where we introduce a few new

1342
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,760
segments and, uh, condense a couple other segments, so it's new stuff.

1343
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:33,560
But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S, and you can also find us on Twitter at Comic

1344
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,200
Insanity, with no I.

1345
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Alright.

1346
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:42,600
Well, uh, my podcast that I do with my buddy, Extafur, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth,

1347
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,080
about all things World of Warcraft, we're not having a format switch this week, but

1348
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,520
I believe we're having Dark Sakura on as our guest this week, so that'll be exciting.

1349
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Hopefully.

1350
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
Yep.

1351
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,400
So, uh, yeah, you can check that out, www.hordehouse.com for more information about our little program

1352
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,040
there, uh, where we talk about the World of Warcraft, but never too seriously, because

1353
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:04,520
I'll tell you what, I've been kind of a jaded Warcraft player lately, so I have not been

1354
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,880
the most happy-go-lucky about the game.

1355
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,800
And I know everybody's like, well then quit, asshole!

1356
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,200
But uh, I've got too many friends that play, and how would I slay internet dragons without

1357
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,200
my wow?

1358
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,280
Anyhow, uh, more talk about World of Warcraft on that show.

1359
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,280
Fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap,

1360
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,280
fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap.

1361
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,280
I do not fap to Warcraft.

1362
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,880
Although, apparently, I don't wanna give too much away, but apparently Extafur's been playing

1363
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:32,040
on a server notorious for the fap chat, and uh, he's gonna give us a report on that this

1364
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,880
week, so that should be exciting.

1365
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,520
As a role-player, you're gonna really look forward to that, huh, Dar Sakura?

1366
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,520
Oh, baby.

1367
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,640
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick stuff.

1368
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,040
There was a lot of little stories this week that unfortunately the PlayStation Network

1369
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,880
was kind of dominating over, but let's get to it.

1370
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,880
Loki, some quick stuff.

1371
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,500
And oh, by the way, your Twitter topic's coming up after this.

1372
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,480
If you haven't gotten your tweets in, you got like two minutes to do it, twitter.com

1373
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,480
slash o-l-r.

1374
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,600
Including one item that actually will be played on the PlayStation Network, Starhawk.

1375
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,520
It is the new, I guess, more futuristic sequel to Warhawk.

1376
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,240
That'll be coming soon, hopefully.

1377
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,920
I'm sure it's gonna be something they show off at E3, and been teased for a while.

1378
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,640
I even think there's some assets or something that leaked out about it.

1379
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,400
But apparently, oh, next year is when it's due out.

1380
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,880
It'll be the same kind of format as Warhawk was.

1381
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,800
They even promised space battles at some point.

1382
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,520
Not sure how that's gonna really work, but also a single player story mode, and a build

1383
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,320
and battle system will be coming to it as well.

1384
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,520
So, if you like that game, you may wanna check it out.

1385
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,320
I know that the original game's really cheap right now, so if you wanna check that out,

1386
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,600
it might be worth it.

1387
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:59,520
And then, of course, yes, the developers of Splosion Man comes Splosion, Ms. Splosion Man.

1388
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:11,280
And of course, not to pass up capitalizing on what might be an internet sensation, 2G1C.

1389
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,060
Some people may think Two Girls, One Cup, but no, Two Girls, One Controller.

1390
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:19,160
So in this game mode, you'll- I try not to think about Two Girls, One Cup ever.

1391
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,160
Yeah.

1392
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,500
Thanks, Loki.

1393
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,400
Two Girls, One Controller, it's a different mode that's gonna be in the game.

1394
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:31,980
You're actually gonna control each one of the Ms. Splosion Men with one analog stick

1395
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:37,240
on the controller, and you would detonate them with the trigger buttons, I believe.

1396
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:42,740
So that's interesting.

1397
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:46,260
I don't know how that'll play, but it's something that they're throwing in that you can try

1398
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,680
out.

1399
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:54,160
And then finally, as I was mentioning earlier, of course, the new update coming out for the

1400
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,160
Xbox 360.

1401
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:01,040
It's gonna reflash those people that had modified firmwares on their DVD drives.

1402
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:09,160
Well, to combat that, of course, people out there have tools to get around things, and

1403
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:16,360
one hacker or tool maker, I guess, Electron, has released E-Tool version 0.2.

1404
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:22,280
It is a new tool for extracting and injecting the key from the light-on fat drives that

1405
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,680
were flashed with the new firmware by the Beta Dash.

1406
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:32,680
So because those firmwares, once they get flashed, it's unable to be read by popular

1407
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,460
programs like the Jungle Flasher and stuff like that.

1408
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,360
So now this program will actually read the keys from that, and it will also reflash the

1409
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,360
drives for you.

1410
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:45,940
So I have a feeling that this new format that they're gonna be putting out there will get

1411
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,680
bypassed very quickly.

1412
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:52,760
In fact, I have a feeling it will be bypassed within a month.

1413
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:59,360
That's probably being very generous.

1414
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,800
And then, yeah, that's it.

1415
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,800
All right.

1416
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,560
So do you think that hack poses a pretty serious threat to all the researchers?

1417
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,560
Well, it's one of many.

1418
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:15,480
I mean, Commodore Forever, they're working on a new firmware for all drives, actually,

1419
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,940
and I believe that already is almost done.

1420
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:24,780
They're just doing some further testing with the new XG, what is it, the XG-D3 format.

1421
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,120
So I'm assuming, though, that that's probably gonna be bypassed.

1422
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:35,120
Then there's also the X360 key, which is supposed to be coming out at some point.

1423
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,880
That's gonna emulate the drive altogether, and that, I think, is the worst threat they

1424
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:47,760
could possibly have, because right there, that's playing game ISOs off of a hard drive

1425
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,300
without needing to really modify your system.

1426
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,300
It's plug-and-play.

1427
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,600
You just plug it in between your drive and the system.

1428
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,960
All right.

1429
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,560
Well, let's move on to some other games coming out this year that, oh my gosh, this one is

1430
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,920
highly anticipated, and I say this year as I hope it comes out this year, although they

1431
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,880
haven't really said.

1432
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,680
Diablo 3, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this, apparently, the internal

1433
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:16,440
company-wide testing has begun, the internal testing process for Diablo 3.

1434
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:21,120
According to Mike Morheim, who's the Blizzard CEO, or I guess he's the guy in charge over

1435
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,960
there, he's saying the game looks great.

1436
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,560
We are currently targeting a quarter-three launch for external beta testing.

1437
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,560
Awesome.

1438
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,120
They are working to get the game out before 2012, but no promises as of yet.

1439
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:38,760
Also, in regards to Diablo 3, apparently there was a promotional video that showed up on

1440
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,840
the internet.

1441
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,080
It did finally go official, but it wasn't supposed, I think this was leaked early from

1442
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,280
the Korean side of Blizzard Entertainment.

1443
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,080
There's a new follower system in Diablo 3.

1444
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,840
You actually hire characters to help you out in the game.

1445
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,920
This kind of sounds inspired by Torchlight, actually, because you can kind of have the

1446
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,040
pet in one of the classes, you can get all these little demon followers, pretty cool.

1447
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,240
But these followers will actually be in different classes, Enchantress, Scoundrel, Templars.

1448
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,760
You're gonna be able to give these guys weapons, rings, and you'll even be able to give them

1449
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,760
their own skills.

1450
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,320
Yeah, this really sounds like the pets from Torchlight, but maybe a little more fleshed

1451
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,320
out.

1452
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,320
So that's pretty exciting.

1453
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,120
Dark Souls, this game is gonna be hard as hell.

1454
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,560
It's gonna come out October 11th, of course, this is the unofficial, well, I shouldn't

1455
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:31,040
say unofficial, but the, don't call it a sequel, but it is to Demon's Souls, which was one

1456
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,240
of those hard as hell games on the PlayStation 3.

1457
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,320
One of the best, hands down, PlayStation 3 exclusive games.

1458
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:41,440
Dark Souls is gonna be coming out on October 11th.

1459
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,880
Even though there's been the PlayStation Network outages and so forth, that's not gonna stop

1460
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,880
them.

1461
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,720
But Kai Hirono, who's the producer of the game, spoke with CVG saying that the outage

1462
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:55,160
caused, quote, some problems for the development, but that the team is, quote, in contact with

1463
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,680
Sony and is aiming to meet a street date of October 11th.

1464
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,640
Well, it's nice that Sony's talking to some of their people.

1465
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:07,320
And also, finally, from me tonight, oh God, it's taken only 413 episodes of Orange Lounge

1466
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:12,000
Radio, but finally, I get to report on a story about Lady Gaga.

1467
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yay!

1468
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,040
And yes, it reports, I'm sorry, it relates to gaming.

1469
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:25,080
That's right, Lady Gaga is coming to, I can't believe I'm gonna say this either, Farmville.

1470
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,600
Oh, I saw the ads for that.

1471
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:34,040
Yeah, Lady Gaga and Zynga a while ago had this whole donation for Japanese disaster

1472
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:41,240
relief going on, and I guess that partnership has grown into the May 17th opening of Gagaville.

1473
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:46,120
It is going to be a neighbor to Farmville.

1474
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:52,000
It's gonna feature unicorns, crystals, and your chance to listen to new tracks from the

1475
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,680
album Born This Way.

1476
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:59,840
Apparently, you're gonna get, like, download vouchers for the album with $25 gift cards,

1477
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:05,540
a word with friends contest to get exclusive DACA merchandise, and so forth.

1478
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,540
Kind of interesting.

1479
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:11,320
At first, I kind of looked at this and I was like, oh God, really, this is so gross.

1480
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,780
I'm gonna have to go and play Farmville again if I want to hear new Gaga songs.

1481
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,520
Like fuck you, Lady Gaga, I don't want to do this.

1482
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:23,080
But then I kind of thought about it and I'm like, actually, considering that Gaga's fan

1483
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:32,920
base is a lot of, let's face it, losers, fuck you, middle aged to teenage girls, and who's

1484
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,760
playing mostly Farmville?

1485
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,360
Middle aged to teenage girls.

1486
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,240
So whereas I'm not super excited about this, like, they're targeting the right audience.

1487
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,080
So it is really smart marketing.

1488
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:48,120
Of course, just as a person who's not a big fan of Zynga products, I'm not that excited,

1489
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,980
but I get it.

1490
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,120
She was on American Idol the other day and I just, I don't get it.

1491
01:20:54,120 --> 01:21:00,200
I really don't understand the appeal of her and I have no appeal of her as a person, her

1492
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,520
as an artist, her music.

1493
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,800
It's just, it's seriously lost on me.

1494
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,400
I think her music's very catchy.

1495
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,400
That's what it's all about.

1496
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,640
And I think she's a very genuine person from her interviews and so forth.

1497
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,640
She's genuine.

1498
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,640
Yeah, I understand.

1499
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:20,340
I mean, yes, there's a lot of marketing machine behind it, yes, but I, she's a living, breathing

1500
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,360
piece of art.

1501
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:26,020
That's how I see her, but that's okay if you don't get it.

1502
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,520
Art is meant to be interpreted in many different ways.

1503
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,520
Yeah.

1504
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,520
Okay.

1505
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,320
I'm sorry.

1506
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,240
Being as strange as possible is not art.

1507
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,900
How fucking cra- What's your excuse?

1508
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,720
How fucking crazy can I be?

1509
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:45,600
Well, hey, I'm not fucking calling what I do art, but seriously, if anyone calls it-

1510
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,880
I just keep thinking of Eddie Izzard now.

1511
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:52,640
It was like, I'm going to put poop on my head and sell myself to an art gallery.

1512
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:59,120
Yes, I'm waiting for the full fecal suit from, you know, Lady Gaga, because it's, it's,

1513
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,120
it's on its way.

1514
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,320
That's the path that she is traveling.

1515
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,440
Maybe when she's in the retirement home, 50 years from now, she'll be wearing a poop suit.

1516
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,440
Please.

1517
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:16,120
It's just gonna be, I don't know, she'll have, uh, she'll make, like, some sort of suit out

1518
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:22,240
of some sort of dinosaur fossil, come out there, you know, calling like an eagle or

1519
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:27,840
something like that, take a giant dump on stage, roll around in it, and set herself

1520
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,040
on fire.

1521
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,040
Boom!

1522
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,040
Lady Gaga concert!

1523
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,040
Next year!

1524
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,040
Okay?

1525
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,040
Alright, look, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but this is too much Lady Gaga chat

1526
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,160
for our show, so let's move on with some more gaming news.

1527
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,760
Do you, do you never saw the link I sent, the two links I sent you?

1528
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,760
What's that?

1529
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:47,760
Well, you know, I keep up with the, uh, gal fashion, and one of the companies that I like

1530
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,000
their clothes is actually Lady Gaga's working with one of the men's styles to release a

1531
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,400
bunch of t-shirts.

1532
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,920
I get all my news from the Fuck Yeah Lady Gaga Tumblr.

1533
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,920
Anyhow.

1534
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,880
And I sent you paper dolls.

1535
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,880
Let's move on.

1536
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,880
More gaming news.

1537
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,720
Okay, well, how about Angry Birds?

1538
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:10,360
It's on Chrome OS and the Chrome browser.

1539
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:15,240
You can actually, uh, play it, um, now, apparently.

1540
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:21,880
Um, it's free to play, has microtransactions, but the, uh, web-exclusive ones have Chrome

1541
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:27,640
bombs, and exclusive Chrome levels, and the paper use Mighty Eagle.

1542
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,000
Yeah, don't care.

1543
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,520
What, Rob?

1544
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,440
So I'm just reading our chatroom chat.orangelandraday.com.

1545
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,600
Tiger Claw says, doing OLR should be considered an art form.

1546
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,000
And Salacious Pop says, OMG Lady Gaga channeling GG Allen.

1547
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,320
He did all those, or maybe Alin, I don't know this artist, but he did all of those things

1548
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,240
that Loki just, he did all those things that Loki just said, by the way, including the

1549
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,520
fire in the poop.

1550
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,520
Yeah.

1551
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,840
So it's already been done, Loki, so I can't do it.

1552
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,840
I'm sorry.

1553
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,840
How about gaming?

1554
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,840
Yes.

1555
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,840
Minecraft stuff.

1556
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:08,120
Uh, basically the creator, um, Marcus Pearson, is, uh, has a poll on his blog about Minecraft

1557
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,720
Con, seeing if people would be interested in attending it in Las Vegas, so there is

1558
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:20,520
a, uh, a no and a yes, and so far no is winning, so.

1559
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,960
I will be bringing a bunch of blocks to put in front of the door to trap everyone in Minecraft

1560
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,280
Con.

1561
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:31,440
I'm looking at this screen capture from, I'm guessing, from Minecraft, and it looks completely,

1562
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,560
these people have too much damn time.

1563
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,840
So how about Mortal Kombat?

1564
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,800
Yeah, I don't know, I think Minecraft Con's not a terrible idea, because hell, they have

1565
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,760
cons for people that dress up like furry animals, so, you know, if the furries can have their

1566
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,360
con, you know.

1567
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:54,580
Mortal Kombat Collection will be, the original trilogy will be going on the Xbox Live Arcade

1568
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:58,880
and the Playstation Network, and, of course, Collection is spelled with a K, and it will

1569
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,160
also be on PC for 800 Microsoft points.

1570
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,160
Does Lady Gaga have a convention?

1571
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,760
Would it be called Gaga for GagaCon?

1572
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,760
Perhaps.

1573
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,440
I know Cher has a convention, did I ever tell you about that story?

1574
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,520
I was in, uh, LA, I was in Woodland Hills specifically for work, doing some stuff down

1575
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,440
there, and, uh, I was staying at a hotel, and I get in this elevator with literally

1576
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,920
fifteen people all decked out in Cher shirts and concert, and I was kinda like, oh, is

1577
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Cher in town?

1578
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,320
They're like, no, there's a Cher convention going on here at the hotel.

1579
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,000
And I'm like, oh.

1580
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Is she here?

1581
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,840
And they're like, no, she's in France.

1582
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,340
Like, oh.

1583
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,480
But she sent a video or something like that.

1584
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,240
If I could turn back time.

1585
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:42,960
I literally walked into a Cher convention, and despite what you may think about homosexuals,

1586
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,160
I'm not, like, screaming, ah, for Cher.

1587
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,160
Like, she's cool.

1588
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,160
I think she's pretty fierce.

1589
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,960
I wonder what's the show about Chaz.

1590
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,360
I don't, yeah, I don't really follow the Cher stuff, but my mother loves Cher.

1591
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,240
I got dragged to a Cher concert by my mother.

1592
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,520
Rob.

1593
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,080
I just love Cher.

1594
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,480
She's so funny.

1595
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,720
She's such a diva, Rob.

1596
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,160
I like your mom.

1597
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,400
I want your mom to adopt me.

1598
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,600
I can't believe she's younger than me, though.

1599
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,340
All right, anyhow, um, oh yeah, Mortal Kombat Collection, sounds great.

1600
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,400
If we didn't already have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox Live Arcade and Mortal Kombat

1601
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,920
2 on PlayStation Network.

1602
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,240
But then they stopped selling 3 or something?

1603
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,240
They did.

1604
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,120
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was delisted some time ago.

1605
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,640
Yeah, it was delisted after they decided, hey, we're gonna re-release it again.

1606
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,640
Haha.

1607
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,280
All right.

1608
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,120
Anyhow, Rama in our chatroom says, Gaga convention?

1609
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,060
It's called the West Village, Rob.

1610
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,400
So noted.

1611
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,560
I would like to pick up that whole Mortal Kombat with the new arcade stick they're gonna

1612
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,600
put out, though, because Mortal Kombat 2 especially was so awesome, especially with the real stick.

1613
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,120
Well, they were, whatever happened to, they were supposed to be putting out an HD collection

1614
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,120
or something like that on the PlayStation 3, it's gonna be all the Mortal Kombat games,

1615
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,120
like, re-done.

1616
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,120
I think that's this.

1617
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,160
But this isn't this, or this isn't that.

1618
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:06,480
It's basically just, hey, look, we're porting the shit straight over, we're not doing anything

1619
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,480
to it.

1620
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,480
Then they decide, hey, you know what?

1621
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,760
They decide to put out some poop and set it on fire.

1622
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,520
It's too much work to actually do something, let's just re-release the old shit.

1623
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,520
Alright.

1624
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,520
Let's go to some Twitter.

1625
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,000
Let's do the Nintendo way.

1626
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,160
Let's go to the tweets, twitter.com slash olr, tweet, tweet, tweet.

1627
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,720
Every week you guys tweet us and we read your tweets, unless you're gonna tweet something

1628
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,160
that we're gonna talk about on the show in about 30 minutes, anyway.

1629
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,400
I'mNotBenji sends us a tweet, well then who are you?

1630
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,280
Sends us a tweet saying, can I pre-F you?

1631
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,280
If so, F you to being at a place tonight where I can't listen to OLR.

1632
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,840
That is screwed up, F that.

1633
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:49,160
I would say though, just a tip, if you are a smartphone owner, especially like the iPhones,

1634
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,520
I'm not sure how well this works on Android and the other stuff, because I'm an iPhone

1635
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:56,960
owner, but allgames.com runs on HTML5, so you can actually get the feed by just going

1636
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,720
to allgames.com on your iPhone or whatever, so just saying, just for future reference.

1637
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,920
BobbyBlackWolf tweeted us that he has now sent the best email ever.

1638
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,240
I'm looking forward to it.

1639
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:14,440
FunnyTman tweets us saying, this is a fun little Metroidvania type game I found.

1640
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:20,920
So I'm going to the link here, it's IndieGames.com, and the game is called Hydra Castle Labyrinth

1641
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,920
Buster.

1642
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,740
Oh, maybe that's the author, I don't know, but Hydra Castle Labyrinth.

1643
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:31,720
It's a freeware 2D platformer created by E. Hashimoto, who made Akuji the Demon and Guardian

1644
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,800
of Paradise.

1645
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:40,200
It's similar to La Mulana, and the Castlevania series.

1646
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,580
The health gauge and sub weapon indicator are both displayed on the top left corner

1647
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,200
of the screen.

1648
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:52,280
Hydra Castle Labyrinth you can download from Buster's site, hp.vector.code.jp.

1649
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,220
This sounds pretty cool, and it's only 1.25 megs.

1650
01:28:55,220 --> 01:29:00,880
I will kindly link this in our chat room, so if you guys want to check that out, there

1651
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:01,880
you go.

1652
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,640
Enjoy.

1653
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,960
It sounds like Dark Tetsuya has already played it, I'm so not surprised.

1654
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,960
Alright.

1655
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,240
Sj100matt tweets us a couple things, one of them is coming up a little later in the show,

1656
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,360
but the other one I want to mention is, with arcades being closed down, a new video game

1657
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:20,060
themed lounge has opened up in Las Vegas, looks nice.

1658
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:25,120
You know, I heard there's a new arcade in San Francisco as well, and I can't remember

1659
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,180
for the life of me what the name is.

1660
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:31,240
Maybe somebody in chat won't figure it out for me, but there's a new arcade in San Francisco

1661
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,880
I think, I haven't been to yet.

1662
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,440
And now apparently there's this place called Insert Coins in Las Vegas, it's a video lounge

1663
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,440
game bar.

1664
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,080
Yeah, I remember seeing that.

1665
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,980
Huh, that sounds kind of neat.

1666
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:46,800
It will, according to the website here that I'm on right now, Insert Coins will electrify

1667
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:53,720
all your senses with its revolutionary amalgamation of classic arcades, ultra lounge service,

1668
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,480
console video gaming, and the world's greatest video DJs, all under its 7,000 square foot

1669
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:03,560
roof, nestled in the iconic neon-laden Fremont East District of Las Vegas.

1670
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,200
That actually sounds kind of awesome, I got to say.

1671
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:11,960
It sounds like it's video games meets booze meets loud music.

1672
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:12,960
Sounds awesome.

1673
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,440
Maybe this type of shit's ready to make a resurgence.

1674
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,440
That's kind of what I'm hoping.

1675
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:19,960
Like, you know, I got to say, when I went to Portland, one of the most awesome places

1676
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:24,600
I went to was the barcade that they had there, and I apologize, I forget the name of it,

1677
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,600
but it's-

1678
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,600
Ground control.

1679
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,600
Thank you.

1680
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,600
Thank you.

1681
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,720
Dan's yelling at it from the other room.

1682
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,720
Ground control.

1683
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,920
Yeah, that place was- isn't that place fucking rad, Dan?

1684
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:36,120
Oh, God, Dan, you got to go.

1685
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:40,000
Oh my God, it's beer and 80s games.

1686
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,160
All right, Dan says road trip.

1687
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,920
We might just have to.

1688
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,920
It's awesome.

1689
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:52,080
So, anyhow, you know, it's a bummer you're starting school that week, because before

1690
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,120
we go to LA, we could go to Portland and go to ground control.

1691
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,880
You know, yeah, screw Dark Sakura.

1692
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:00,880
You and I'll go, Dan.

1693
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,480
Hey.

1694
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:10,000
Dan and I are going to go on a bro trip.

1695
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Dan's yelling from the kitchen.

1696
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
What's the first gayest thing you've ever done?

1697
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,520
It'll be the second gayest thing-

1698
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,960
Oh, yeah.

1699
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,600
This is horrible radio, because they can't hear you.

1700
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,880
We need to have a boom mic in the kitchen just for Dan.

1701
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,560
Dan, get in here and do a report.

1702
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:29,200
Dan said the first gayest thing he did was play rock band at Matt's party.

1703
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,560
Let me move on to some more tweets.

1704
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,360
Spazinator PSN tweets us saying PlayStation Network is down again as of 9 p.m. Eastern,

1705
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,720
6 p.m. Pacific.

1706
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,600
And I was like, well, wait a minute, Spazinator.

1707
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,880
Maybe you just need to try it four times before you get in, like I had to do earlier.

1708
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,960
But I'm looking at the official PlayStation blog.

1709
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,360
Guess what?

1710
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,640
We are currently experiencing an extremely heavy load of password resets.

1711
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,640
And so we recently had to turn off services for approximately 30 minutes to clear the

1712
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,720
queue.

1713
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:03,380
As such, a large number of people are attempting to change their passwords at the same time.

1714
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:08,560
It's taking longer than expected for all those emails to clear all of the ISPs.

1715
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:14,600
So yep, not even 24 hours after it came back up, PlayStation Network had to go back down.

1716
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,600
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

1717
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,240
What a whore.

1718
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,120
More tweets for, what, did you call it a whore?

1719
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,120
Exactly.

1720
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:28,200
Had to go back down.

1721
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:33,800
Hey, Tiger Claw sends us a couple tweets.

1722
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,680
Oops, I guess I just reported on one of them.

1723
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:40,220
But I'll read this other one about the Sony Online Entertainment Senior Producer is now

1724
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:43,680
the Zynga Austin GM.

1725
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,800
That's John Blakely.

1726
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,240
He did some projects including Star Wars Galaxies and DC Universe Onlines.

1727
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,360
Now he's leading Zynga in Austin.

1728
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,680
So he went from the dark side to the darker side.

1729
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,840
All from his LinkedIn profile.

1730
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,960
Let's see.

1731
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,840
Candied Critique sends us a tweet saying, someone makes Counter-Strike, Osama compound

1732
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,840
map.

1733
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,840
Yay or nay?

1734
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,800
I thought something like this we had discussed on the show this week.

1735
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,740
And this isn't all too surprising.

1736
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:20,100
Give a bunch of gamers a blank palette and controversial things are sure to be made everywhere

1737
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,840
from nude patches to overly violent things to real life scenarios that may or may not

1738
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,880
be kind of tacky playing out.

1739
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:33,360
So yeah, we get linked to this article here about the Pakistani compound where Osama bin

1740
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,800
Laden of course, I mean unless you've been living under a fucking rock, was found and

1741
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:43,480
killed by US Navy Seals, is now a playable mod in, what is this, Counter-Strike.

1742
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,700
Oh great.

1743
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,200
So I can go into Counter-Strike and play this game.

1744
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,480
Not only can I play real life news, but I can get called every name in the book while

1745
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:55,000
doing it because Counter-Strike has a really rude online community, just so you know.

1746
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,520
Lastly, here's a question for the host.

1747
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,040
I like these tweets.

1748
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,640
They're questions for the host.

1749
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,860
That's what this really should all be about, but here you go.

1750
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:09,560
TheBaconBits tweets us, IDK if it's been asked before, but what is your guys' favorite game

1751
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,800
soundtrack of all time?

1752
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:17,640
Personally, mine is the SMG OST, I'm assuming that means Super Mario Galaxy OST.

1753
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:22,040
BaconBits asking, what is your favorite game soundtrack of all time?

1754
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,560
Dark Sakura?

1755
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,240
Uh, I...

1756
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,240
I...

1757
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,240
I...

1758
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,240
I...

1759
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,240
I...

1760
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,240
I...

1761
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,240
I...

1762
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,240
I...

1763
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,240
I...

1764
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,240
I...

1765
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,240
I...

1766
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,240
I...

1767
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,240
I...

1768
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,240
I...

1769
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,240
I...

1770
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,960
Um, I don't know.

1771
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:51,600
It would have to be kind of a tossup between, um, well I did like, I listened the crap out

1772
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:57,440
of the Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix soundtrack when that was out because I actually bought

1773
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:02,040
that at Anime Convention, which is pretty awesome, and then I'd say it's either between

1774
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:11,160
4th, 5th, Max, 2, or DJ Hero 1, because DJ Hero 2 is kind of dumb.

1775
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:16,480
Um, as tempted as I am to throw in a Bamani soundtrack like DDR 3rd Mix, probably my favorite

1776
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,600
soundtrack ever, or BeatMania 2DX Fist Style, honestly, I go to the Super Nintendo and there's

1777
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:27,760
three games on the Super Nintendo that for me all kind of tie, maybe one slightly ahead

1778
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,760
for first place.

1779
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,600
Actually, I'm going to add Super Metroid to that one.

1780
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:37,360
Super Metroid would be on my top three, absolutely, Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call

1781
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:42,400
it, would also be up there, but I think just the slight edge, I think probably the greatest

1782
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,840
video game soundtrack ever made, Actraiser.

1783
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,160
I love the Actraiser soundtrack, it is beautiful, gorgeous music.

1784
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,000
You know what actually I'd have to add to my list would be Chrono Trigger.

1785
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,040
Oh, Chrono Trigger's got a pretty fucking sweet soundtrack.

1786
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,840
Linked to a pass is pretty awesome too.

1787
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:02,600
I'm gonna find my favorite piece of music in Chrono Trigger and send it to you to play.

1788
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,160
Alright you do that.

1789
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:08,040
But maybe next week during the break, we're out of music breaks tonight.

1790
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,040
Alright, that's going to do it for the tweets, twitter.com slash olr if you want to get in

1791
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,160
early for next week.

1792
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:18,680
In the meantime, more news, and oh boy, it's the lawsuit segment time.

1793
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,680
Yay!

1794
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,680
Yay!

1795
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:25,160
This is retarded, but a former Navy- Now, Loki, don't use the R word.

1796
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,000
You can say butt-tarded.

1797
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,360
It's retarded.

1798
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,520
Say gay-tarded, because it's doubly offensive.

1799
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,520
No, it's retarded.

1800
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:40,320
Former Navy pilot John Ryan McLaughlin, he is suing Bethesda, because he says that Elder

1801
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:46,320
Scrolls IV Oblivion gave him a grand mal seizure that cost him his flight status.

1802
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:52,040
It was his first seizure he had ever had, and it was violent enough to break a bone,

1803
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:57,920
and I guess he's permanently barred from flying the F-18 planes, which he was trained on.

1804
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,920
And he's suing them because he says Oblivion was designed that it exceeds the upper acceptable

1805
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:09,280
limit of more than three flashes over one second period, as well as an acceptable spatial

1806
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,040
pattern and luminance flash limits.

1807
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:18,440
These risks were not made known to the plaintiff and or ordinary customer prior to the time

1808
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,440
of purchase.

1809
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,700
Bullshit, they're in the manual.

1810
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:27,160
Every fucking manual has a goddamn epilepsy warning in it.

1811
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:31,280
So I'm sorry, that is some serious bullshit right there.

1812
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:39,520
Anyways, he wants damages for negligence, breach of warranty, and product liability.

1813
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,520
He's gonna lose.

1814
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:48,800
But yeah, every goddamn manual, and fuck, every goddamn manual since games had manuals,

1815
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,800
have had that warning in there.

1816
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,120
I think like from the Nintendo, well I'm sure they've had manuals for games before that,

1817
01:37:54,120 --> 01:38:01,240
but Nintendo I think was one of the first series of games or whatever that had manuals

1818
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:06,800
that had that warning in there because I always thought it was ridiculous, but I mean people

1819
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:13,720
have seizures because of flashing lights sometimes, but I'm sorry, just take some responsibility

1820
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,720
for yourself.

1821
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:18,800
Yeah, it sucks that you can't fly anymore, but you know what, if you had this problem

1822
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,680
to begin with and this game set it off, then it's probably a good thing that you're not

1823
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:28,600
flying a plane.

1824
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,880
I mean seriously, oh he didn't realize he had seizure problems or whatever and something

1825
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,440
flashes and he crashes the damn plane into an orphanage.

1826
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,720
I don't remember there being an amazing seizure mode in Oblivion either, you know it wasn't

1827
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:45,480
like that Pokemon cartoon from years ago where it flashed the red and blue rapidly that kind

1828
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:49,840
of caused all those kids to have seizures, I don't, like, you know Oblivion's been out

1829
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:56,480
for a long time now too, you know, but I think seizures are an unfortunate side effect to

1830
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:01,120
gaming in general for some people, you know, unfortunately some people have to really watch

1831
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,240
the video games they play.

1832
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:06,200
For example, Dark Sakura has talked openly on the show about how she can't play first

1833
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,360
person shooters very long, she gets motion sick, you know.

1834
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,880
I have thrown up, Portal 2 made me throw up.

1835
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:17,320
You have to control yourself, you know, and unfortunately some people have limits and

1836
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,640
you gotta, you know, control those limits.

1837
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:20,640
You can't-

1838
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,920
Turn the brightness down on your TV when you play Oblivion or something, you know.

1839
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:28,400
You can't blame a game for a problem that clearly existed before that.

1840
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:35,880
If other, okay, you've got person A who has zero inclination towards epilepsy, and you've

1841
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:40,920
got person B who doesn't know they have any inclination towards epilepsy, but they do.

1842
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,820
And you sit them both in front of the same product, well of course the one who has the

1843
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:50,040
inclination, whether they know about it or not, is going to react to it.

1844
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:53,320
It's like how I found out I was allergic to bell peppers.

1845
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,320
I didn't know.

1846
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,320
My mom eats them.

1847
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:58,120
I ate a bell pepper, my tongue swelled up, and I got sick.

1848
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,120
Yeah.

1849
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,120
You know.

1850
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,680
And besides that, they're nasty.

1851
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,680
BlackWolf in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com says, at least he got the seizure while playing

1852
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,760
a video game rather than well flying.

1853
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,000
Yeah, so like I said, yeah, would you rather he be flying a plane and, you know, get a

1854
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,880
seizure than crash into, I don't know, an orphanage, orphanage, a mall, and-

1855
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,880
Would you rather be-

1856
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,880
Children.

1857
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,880
Children.

1858
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,880
For dead.

1859
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:23,800
Well, let's talk about another lawsuit and this one, oh boy.

1860
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,200
This is a lawsuit against Chuck E. Cheese.

1861
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:30,280
Is it for the fact that they got rid of all their good arcade games?

1862
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,280
Because I wanted to join in on that one.

1863
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,240
Actually sort of.

1864
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:38,920
It's a lawsuit against the ticket dispensing games at Chuck E. Cheese because it creates

1865
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,600
gambling addiction in little children.

1866
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,300
A lawsuit has been filed in California.

1867
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,400
They're looking for five million dollars.

1868
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,600
The person who filed the lawsuit, Denise Keller.

1869
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,880
She's a mom, two girls, five and three.

1870
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,980
Chuck E. Cheese's arcade games are akin to slot machines, says the complaint.

1871
01:40:55,980 --> 01:41:01,000
By offering tickets as a payout that can be redeemed for prizes, the machines, quote,

1872
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,680
create the same highs and lows experienced by adults who gamble their paychecks or the

1873
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,160
mortgage payment.

1874
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:11,200
The lawyer says, it's not about the money, it's about the kids.

1875
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,200
Right.

1876
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:15,600
California law forbids gambling.

1877
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,480
That's only like partially true because I can think of poker rooms out in Rancho Cordova,

1878
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,000
which is an incorporated city.

1879
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,880
And I can think of Indian casinos not far up the free with Thunder Valley, not that

1880
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,760
far up 80, Red Hawk, not that far up 50.

1881
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,520
And fuck, Reno is only like two hours away.

1882
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:37,620
I mean, if California bans gambling, I get it.

1883
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,360
The Indian casinos are on Indian land.

1884
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,360
I understand that.

1885
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,360
And the California lottery?

1886
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,080
Yeah, the lottery.

1887
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:47,420
So they don't ban gambling that well, you know what I mean?

1888
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:51,240
But anyhow, it does make an exception for payouts if the contest is predominantly a

1889
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:57,520
game of skill, which as you know, these crane games and skeeball games and so forth, they

1890
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,040
are of course mainly games of skill.

1891
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,920
Well that's awesome that those, well I don't know if it's really awesome.

1892
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,000
It's tragic that that three and five year old are spending their hard-earned mortgage

1893
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,200
payments and their paychecks that they get for doing what?

1894
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,200
Coloring well?

1895
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,240
I mean, seriously, it's the parent that's taking them to Chuck E. Cheats.

1896
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:22,200
It's the parent giving them money to spend money on these games.

1897
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,960
I don't understand.

1898
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,040
I don't even understand the problem here.

1899
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:30,420
I actually would take an unpopular opinion somewhat with this and say she actually kind

1900
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:32,120
of has a point with this whole thing.

1901
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:38,400
I do think this is probably not healthy for all children, but at the same time, why sue

1902
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,960
Chuck E. Cheese over it?

1903
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:44,040
That's ridiculous because you absolutely have the right to not go there.

1904
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,040
And you know what?

1905
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:50,260
I bet if enough people didn't go to Chuck E. Cheese and didn't go to have their birthday

1906
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:54,100
parties at Chuck E. Cheese and let their kids have birthday parties there, they would probably

1907
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:57,520
have to get rid of these machines or the company would go bankrupt or maybe they'd go back

1908
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:58,880
to having legitimate arcade games.

1909
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,880
I don't know.

1910
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:04,340
I want to know why, you know, all of these, because ticket redemption games have been

1911
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,640
around forever since I was a little kid.

1912
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,640
Right.

1913
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,640
It's not forever.

1914
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,640
Don't say that.

1915
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,640
Anyway.

1916
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,400
Um, but why is it that we're just now getting somebody complaining about it?

1917
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,560
I really don't get it, especially when everybody else seems to be just fine with it.

1918
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,920
People can get addicted to anything.

1919
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,200
I'm not finished.

1920
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,200
Sorry.

1921
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,200
Thank you.

1922
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,840
The, the whole point is that it's a parenting issue.

1923
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,760
You don't want your kids to participate in something.

1924
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,200
You don't take them there or you don't let them play it.

1925
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:36,760
Um, Salacious Pop in our chat room says many ticket games are a test of skill.

1926
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,800
Some ticket games are goddamn bullshit.

1927
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,800
Agreed.

1928
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:44,720
Uh, The Legend of Zaku says, remember kids, America equals Sue the bastard's land.

1929
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,840
You know, he kind of has a point.

1930
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:49,960
I almost see she's teaching these kids a worse lesson by going through with this lawsuit.

1931
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:50,960
This is my opinion.

1932
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,320
Well, that's the way it is now.

1933
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:57,120
If people find an opportunity to make money, they're going to gamble their chances and

1934
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,120
do it.

1935
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,840
I mean, it's all it.

1936
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,560
People can make the argument that they can be addicted to anything.

1937
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,960
So, so we get rid of everything because that's really what it's going to come down to.

1938
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,960
You get rid of these ticket redemption games, they're going to say, oh, well, I'm addicted

1939
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,440
to winning at arcade games.

1940
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,240
Then you get rid of the arcade games.

1941
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:21,700
Well, oh, well, I'm addicted to, uh, I don't know, um, riding in a little motorized cars

1942
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:24,840
that they have at, you know, Chuck E. Cheese or something like that.

1943
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,400
Well, then we got to get rid of those too.

1944
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,000
Oh, well, now I'm addicted to eating pizza.

1945
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,680
Let's get rid of pizza.

1946
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,680
Where does it stop?

1947
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:36,760
I mean, it's just people are going to be finding anything to sue over.

1948
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,520
And this, unfortunately, is the latest in many, I'm sure lawsuits that are going to

1949
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:45,620
be in our legal system forever.

1950
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,880
We've already had this regarding casinos.

1951
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,120
We've already had it regarding online gaming, you know, just put it this way, people, it's

1952
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,840
like you're saying, people do have addictive personalities.

1953
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:56,840
The thing exists.

1954
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:01,200
Everyone's going to have their crack, whether it's, you know, watching Monday night football,

1955
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:07,000
ooh, or, you know, people get obsessed about things that they're into.

1956
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,800
It's just a matter of teaching people to control themselves.

1957
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,660
And quite honestly, if a person can't control themselves, well, that's not my problem.

1958
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:15,160
Why should my life be affected by that?

1959
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,680
God forbid the kids have fun playing a game, you know?

1960
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,680
Oh, hey, let's try to earn some tickets to go get a prize.

1961
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,900
Oh, that's just blasphemy.

1962
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:26,800
Why are we letting these kids, you know, get addicted to getting tickets?

1963
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,960
They're not getting addicted to getting tickets to her kids.

1964
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,160
They're having fun.

1965
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,640
If they have a problem, they're like, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I need you to take me back and

1966
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,080
go get more tickets so I can get a bigger prize.

1967
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,040
Well, then know what you do, you say, no, I'm not fucking taking you back to get more

1968
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,040
tickets.

1969
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,200
And if they cry and have a tantrum, then you give them a time out or you spank them.

1970
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:47,720
Is it seriously that terrible to parent your child?

1971
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,640
I mean, shit, I know as being a parent, it's not that hard to say no.

1972
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,680
And not only a parent, a Mensa member.

1973
01:45:55,680 --> 01:46:01,080
That doesn't mean it's a smart thing to do, right, Logie?

1974
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,840
This is what smart people do.

1975
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:08,200
I can't say that Akuma JP in our chat, literally, I cannot say that because you can literally

1976
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:12,000
get kicked out of Mensa for saying as a Mensa member, I really, yes.

1977
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Oh my God.

1978
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Can I just lie?

1979
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,520
It's not a tangent here.

1980
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:21,360
Can I lie and say I'm a Mensa member and just say as a Mensa member, I'll get sued.

1981
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,320
I'll probably, no, no, no, no, no.

1982
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,040
There's some, some hilarious shit in here.

1983
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,600
Sorry to get sidetracked here very quick.

1984
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,520
I was going to read this comment real quick.

1985
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:31,280
Akuma JP in our chatroom at chat.orangishontraday.com.

1986
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,160
Logie is addicted to Grand Theft Auto for sure.

1987
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:39,600
Oh yeah, I don't, no, seriously, I spent an unhealthy amount of my day thinking about

1988
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,480
Grand Theft Auto, playing Grand Theft Auto.

1989
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,400
I may or may not be addicted to World of Warcraft.

1990
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:48,040
And let's face it, everyone is addicted to video games.

1991
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:51,140
No, no, it's not that I'm addicted to Grand Theft Auto.

1992
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:55,420
I have fun playing Grand Theft Auto, and I have fun modding Grand Theft Auto.

1993
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:58,720
Why is that a problem that I like doing something, you know?

1994
01:46:58,720 --> 01:46:59,720
It's not like I can't stop.

1995
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,720
You're not allowed to have fun.

1996
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:08,600
Okay, um, I'm just going to tell you something.

1997
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,600
It's just really hilarious.

1998
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,320
I got to find, and my wife was reading this to me because she was, oh, here it is.

1999
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:17,640
I think this is it right here.

2000
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,320
Here's some rules or whatever that they have.

2001
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:24,720
Oh, member policies, let's see here.

2002
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,760
Are you allowed to read these?

2003
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,760
Well, it's not like it's, you know, some secret guide or something.

2004
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,760
That's not masonry.

2005
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:39,160
Well, I, okay, anyways, one of the things, yeah, you can't really, you know, say something

2006
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:44,440
as like saying, oh, well, as a member of Mensa, you know, I believe, blah, blah, blah.

2007
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,800
But that wasn't even the part that I thought was ridiculous.

2008
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:52,840
They give you a sample press, I kid you not, a sample press release of how you can form

2009
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,760
your own press release to send out to your local paper and your friends saying that you

2010
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:57,760
got in the Mensa.

2011
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,320
No, I'm not that vain.

2012
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:00,320
Sorry.

2013
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,320
I, you know what though?

2014
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:05,460
Like in the, it may be in a suburbia town, you know, in a big market like Sacramento,

2015
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:08,920
you know, as much as we joke about ourselves, we are still like what the 20th largest market

2016
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:09,920
in the nation.

2017
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:13,080
But go to like the Midwest and a lot of those little towns, maybe it is kind of a big deal.

2018
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:18,920
It's just like, you know, putting a big giant sign on my back that says, nerd, make fun

2019
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:22,560
of me and beat my ass while you're at it.

2020
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:29,440
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm not going to invite that kind of, um, attention.

2021
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,440
All right.

2022
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:34,880
Well, the next story up is dark soccer is, but she's left, so she has left the building.

2023
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:40,400
Let's talk more sewer for not fulfilling your obligations to garden burgers and I was preparing

2024
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,400
mine.

2025
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,400
All right.

2026
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,400
So that's it.

2027
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,400
I'm suing garden burgers.

2028
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,400
We're going to get rid of those crap.

2029
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,400
God damn you.

2030
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,400
Garden burgers.

2031
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:52,120
I'm now available for beta for PC gamers.

2032
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:55,120
Shut up, Dan.

2033
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:58,440
I love you.

2034
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,800
Okay.

2035
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:04,320
So for people who want to do more for portal to valve has portal to authoring tools.

2036
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,320
Yay.

2037
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,520
If you've got a PC, you can do this.

2038
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:12,320
Um, it's free for anyone who owns the game on PC and it's in the tools tab on your steam

2039
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,680
account.

2040
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:19,400
So I'm basically, you'll just be able to go into everything, character skins, a single

2041
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,160
player, co-op level, sound effects, music, 3d models.

2042
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,160
They are all there.

2043
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,980
You can do them all.

2044
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:34,960
But there's also nasty, Hey, there's also an updated version of face poser and a different

2045
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,300
example maps and instances to help you learn.

2046
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:44,640
So there's a new suite of command line compiling utilities.

2047
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:48,480
I want someone to make the orange lounge level, made the orange lounge level.

2048
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,480
Put it up.

2049
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,480
All right.

2050
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,300
Why are you looking at doors?

2051
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:59,520
I'm looking at something from online, something that, uh, Alan's doing.

2052
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:00,520
All right.

2053
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,520
Moving on.

2054
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,800
He's probably giggling that that came out.

2055
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:03,800
All right.

2056
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:04,800
Uh, moving on.

2057
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,800
Loki.

2058
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:06,800
What do you have for us?

2059
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,800
Yes.

2060
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,000
So this is kind of funny.

2061
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,480
Apparently the PlayStation one classics, they've been slow to sell.

2062
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,000
Um, really?

2063
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,640
No one's wanting to buy your PlayStation one games to play them on a device that most likely

2064
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:29,320
doesn't have, uh, buttons, but no, these are actually meant for the, uh, Xperia play phone

2065
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:32,120
that you know, the PlayStation phone, if you will.

2066
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:40,720
Um, apparently I guess there's only, um, you know, a very few, uh, sales for each one.

2067
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:46,160
They're saying that under a thousand installs for each title, uh, co-orders two destruction

2068
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,880
Derby, medieval siphon filter and jumping flash.

2069
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,880
And most of those are actually only in the few hundreds.

2070
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:57,320
Um, they're saying that also that, um, they're saying it's not really a concern since there's

2071
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:01,720
only a few, um, at the, um, moment.

2072
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:07,200
Um, PlayStation one titles, um, here or there, there's more coming on a regular basis.

2073
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:12,000
He said, and as a whole, the PlayStation as a content provider exclusive to the device.

2074
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,400
So there's no real concerns.

2075
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,080
It's a revolutionary device and it's shaking up the marketplace and we're very pleased

2076
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,080
with it.

2077
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:23,000
Um, also it should be meant, you know, there is a reason why that maybe it's not working

2078
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:29,800
is because, um, not necessarily on the marketplace, but you can get it for that phone.

2079
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,200
Um, there actually are other PlayStation emulators that you can download ROMs for and those don't

2080
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:38,640
cost you anything.

2081
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,640
So maybe that's the issue.

2082
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,700
I think a lot of people are just buying the phone because you know what?

2083
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:50,000
It's kind of cool to play other games with buttons, you know, like some of the other

2084
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,720
Android games.

2085
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:58,160
I, I, yeah, this whole like lack of buttons thing, just, I can't believe they've even

2086
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,480
sold as many as they have.

2087
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,240
The sound is just absolutely terrible.

2088
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,120
It's as terrible as the PSP go.

2089
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:07,480
Well, I, I mean, one of the things I think that they're, they're forgetting about is

2090
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:11,880
like, listen, just because this, you know, system's a PlayStation and it's not really

2091
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:16,920
a PlayStation Xperia play fine, you know, just because it has a PlayStation controller

2092
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:21,360
set up on it doesn't mean people are going to necessarily buy just PlayStation one games

2093
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,360
with it.

2094
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:27,620
I mean, you can get a bunch of other games that support this, you know, type of a controller

2095
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:30,880
mapping and you can play those just fine.

2096
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:35,020
Have you ever thought that maybe, you know, a game that was put out 10 years ago might

2097
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:38,280
not stand up well against, you know, some of the newer games?

2098
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:41,840
Yeah, I think Sony's just losing touch there with what people want.

2099
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,280
Granted, Cool Borders is a pretty fun game and Destruction Derby's not bad on its own

2100
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:55,620
and Medieval's all right, but like, I don't know, it's just, they're showing their age.

2101
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:58,040
But you know, Kazurai's a real party animal.

2102
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,200
He's hip to what the kids are into.

2103
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,200
Exactly.

2104
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:05,880
He's, he's, he's got his finger on the pulse of what's hot.

2105
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:07,800
What gamers really want.

2106
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,800
Absolutely.

2107
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,800
All right.

2108
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:14,000
Yeah, when he's not partying in his, you know, yacht.

2109
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,320
Let's talk about the Xbox for a minute and their games on demand service.

2110
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:21,560
Of course, you can buy full games through the games on demand service and download them

2111
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:22,920
to your hard drive.

2112
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,860
Usually these are games that have been out for a little while.

2113
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:28,920
You don't see a lot of stuff that comes out like as they're new, but this is interesting.

2114
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:35,220
Cave is going to be releasing Death Smiles 2X directly to games on demand.

2115
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:38,280
There will not be a disc release in North America.

2116
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:41,740
The game will cost $30, excuse me, $29.99.

2117
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:42,960
They're not translating it.

2118
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,600
It's going to be straight up in Japanese.

2119
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:48,920
You are buying basically the import game, but playable on your Xbox 360 through games

2120
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,040
on demand.

2121
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:53,040
But because it's a shooter game, it's not like you need to have a real thorough knowledge

2122
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,040
of Japanese.

2123
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,320
You have to have no knowledge of Japanese, seriously.

2124
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,960
It's going to launch Tuesday, May 17th.

2125
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,920
Facebook is where they announced this.

2126
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,240
Boy, what a sign of the times.

2127
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:07,720
Cave announced this on Facebook saying, quote, it will be giving this format a try for getting

2128
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:11,320
some of our Japan-only shooters released overseas.

2129
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:16,120
I have to be honest, it's kind of a neat idea.

2130
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:19,760
Like, you know, there's a lot of people that really like import games and would like to

2131
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,400
be playing them, and it sucks that the Xbox is region-locked the way it is.

2132
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:28,600
And import games are fucking expensive, so $30 for a game like that, even if they aren't

2133
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:35,320
doing any translations whatsoever, it's awesome because you're saving yourself, you know,

2134
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:40,800
probably about, you know, 50% of the cost of an import.

2135
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:41,800
I think...

2136
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,900
Actually more than that, probably.

2137
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:47,280
This would actually kind of discourage some of the hacking, because sometimes people hack

2138
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,760
their systems to play import games.

2139
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,560
That's the reason why I hacked my original PlayStation 1.

2140
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:56,560
So there you go.

2141
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,560
Interesting.

2142
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,600
I...

2143
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,240
Maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale, eventually.

2144
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,040
$30, I don't know, I never...

2145
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,000
I'm not, like, super good at shooters.

2146
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,760
Also, you know what's interesting about this?

2147
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,860
By not getting a disc release, you won't be able to get it through Gamefly or anything

2148
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:13,120
like that, or Rental, and you have to either pay the 30 bucks or don't play.

2149
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:15,520
We'll see how well that goes over.

2150
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,800
Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

2151
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:22,840
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2152
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:27,360
DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out a few emails that she says,

2153
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:33,040
hey, you guys should be reading, er, you guys should be, er, writing us more emails.

2154
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,040
First email.

2155
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:35,040
First email.

2156
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:39,360
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here with a question for you all.

2157
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:43,040
After having done this radio show for a long time, do you ever get that itch to work closer

2158
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,040
to the video game industry?

2159
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,040
No, not at all.

2160
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,040
Not at all.

2161
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:49,320
I mean, I know that Loki works in distribution, but do any of you feel like you would enjoy

2162
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:54,120
having a hand in a game's development rather than simply reporting the news and your opinions?

2163
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:58,200
Or do you prefer to stay at arm's length and pay no mind to the man behind the curtain?

2164
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,200
Absolutely.

2165
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:03,380
And I've already pitched, you know, or I've already pitched the idea that I want to pitch

2166
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:09,080
an idea to Konami to, you know, it's tough actually going up to them and saying, listen,

2167
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:12,920
I want to fix your franchise because they don't really take kindly to that kind of stuff.

2168
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:18,640
But re-imagine and modernize a franchise, I suppose, would be the better way to do it.

2169
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:19,960
But yeah, I'd love to do that.

2170
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:23,280
But at the same time, you know, I have a day job, so it'd be kind of hard to quit a day

2171
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,280
job to go work on a game.

2172
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,560
And God knows they're not going to actually listen to one person that has an idea about

2173
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:36,600
how they can improve a certain franchise because I'm sure they get thousands of emails from

2174
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,080
people that do, you know, something very similar.

2175
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:44,140
But if they were ballsy and wanted to take a chance, that'd be pretty cool.

2176
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:46,240
It's a question that's bugged me for a long time as well.

2177
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:50,040
I finally decided to take the plunge and leave my steady e-commerce job for a spot in the

2178
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:55,440
games industry as a programmer for GameSpyTech, who support matchmaking and other online infrastructure

2179
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:59,620
for games such as Command & Conquer, Pokemon Black & White, Crysis 2, and most recently

2180
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:00,940
Mortal Kombat.

2181
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:04,180
My fear is that I'll become jaded to video games or just not be able to keep up with

2182
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:08,160
the crazy hours that I've heard you need to put in to make it in the industry.

2183
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:09,940
So OLR men and women, what are your thoughts?

2184
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:14,040
Are you content to admire the industry from afar or do you want to dive into the trenches?

2185
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:18,360
Yours truly is EHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient and general grammar advocate.

2186
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:22,200
P.S. have started a scientific poll on my Facebook to prove that everyone appreciates

2187
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,200
boobs.

2188
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:27,960
Aside from the insignificant outliner data, the results support OLR's hypothesis.

2189
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:31,840
Feel free to share it in chat so that I can obtain more data and I will copy it into chat.

2190
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,840
There you go.

2191
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:44,120
So I actually, if certain things require a relocation on our part, I'm planning on applying

2192
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:49,280
with Valve, Nintendo, and Microsoft because what I want to do is publication.

2193
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:54,240
Gee, I wonder if she might be thinking of relocating too.

2194
01:57:54,240 --> 01:58:01,140
I'm wanting to do publication, like manuals, advertising, anything that's going to go into

2195
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:04,640
a digital or physical print.

2196
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,640
I have to admit, I'm a little torn on it.

2197
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,680
I honestly have to say no.

2198
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:11,440
I don't think there's a lot I could contribute on the front lines.

2199
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,440
I'm not a programmer.

2200
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:13,440
I'm not an artist.

2201
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:16,720
Sure, I have ideas about games, but you know what?

2202
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:19,600
Some people kind of do it a little bit better and I'm okay with that.

2203
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,040
I would have no problem being an advisor, a tracker, hell, having done this show as

2204
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:28,080
long as I have, I think I could probably get away with being some type of games analyst.

2205
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,680
But at the same time, I have a day job I rather enjoy.

2206
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,760
I make a decent amount of money.

2207
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,320
I don't really see myself leaving at any time soon.

2208
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:41,240
However, I'm not going to lie, especially from the journalism ends of things, if I ever

2209
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:47,000
had the opportunity to host a show about games, especially on TV, although there's such little

2210
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,080
demand for that, I don't know how that would ever happen, I would jump at that opportunity

2211
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:52,600
in a heartbeat, absolutely.

2212
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,280
Although I worry I'm starting to get a little old for that.

2213
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:00,600
A lot of that stuff is targeted towards 20-somethings and teens and now I'm starting to enter my

2214
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,600
mid thirties.

2215
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:04,680
So I don't know if I would really be wanted for that.

2216
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:08,440
I would tell you what I would love, love, love to do more than anything.

2217
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:13,880
I would love to host a game show as especially like a throwback to the old Starrcade.

2218
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,560
Because Rob's hero is Bob Barker.

2219
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,760
Even something like Nick Arcade or something like that.

2220
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,760
You want to be painted orange.

2221
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:23,920
I love Bob Barker, but I also love Jean Rayburn from old seventies match game.

2222
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,920
Like I would say.

2223
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,040
You know who my person is?

2224
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,040
Dude from Press Your Luck.

2225
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,040
Oh, Peter Tamarkin.

2226
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,040
Tamarkin.

2227
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,040
Tamarkin.

2228
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,040
Tamarkin.

2229
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:37,280
So yeah, I would absolutely leave my day job in a heartbeat to go be a game show host.

2230
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:43,120
In fact, I actually had an old boss who thought she heard of some TV station casting for who

2231
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:47,220
wants to be a game show host, and she told me I could take leave from work to participate

2232
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,220
in that show.

2233
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:50,440
And she said that it's possible to be arranged.

2234
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:53,160
Unfortunately that show didn't turn out to be legit, but if they ever had something like

2235
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,120
that, I'd go on in a heartbeat, absolutely.

2236
01:59:56,120 --> 02:00:01,280
But at the same time, we've been doing Orange on the Radio as a hobby for nine years now.

2237
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,680
And just radio in general.

2238
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:06,640
I was on Understation Live before that and was doing college radio before that.

2239
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:10,300
Like the radio industry especially is highly competitive.

2240
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:13,760
And I kind of like the fact that we get to do radio on our own terms.

2241
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,040
Yeah, we're not the biggest show out there.

2242
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,580
A lot of people, even after nine years, have no idea who the fuck we are.

2243
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:23,980
But nobody gets between me and you, the listener.

2244
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:25,480
Nobody gets between that.

2245
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,120
Nobody tells us how to do our show but us.

2246
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,920
Nobody gets between Rob and his Calvin Klein's.

2247
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:30,920
And that.

2248
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:35,000
But like literally, no one tells us what to do.

2249
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:39,960
And unfortunately when you go commercial for that, you lose a lot of that.

2250
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:40,960
Yeah.

2251
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,840
And so I don't know how much of that I'd be willing to give up.

2252
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,560
If ever we took any kind of sponsorship, it'd still have to be on our terms.

2253
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:48,560
Absolutely.

2254
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,220
Which is why we'll probably be independent forever.

2255
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:56,000
But that's, I think it's the way at least ye small but loyal few like it.

2256
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,200
And that's how we roll.

2257
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,200
That and we have Shermie.

2258
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,160
That's where we all, we'll always have Shermie.

2259
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:03,160
Yeah.

2260
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,160
So.

2261
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:05,160
Dances would sell out.

2262
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:08,600
I think he's full of crap.

2263
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,600
I don't know.

2264
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:15,260
Like I just, I think it's unrealistic to think like, oh, suddenly big name gaming website

2265
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:18,140
dot com wants to buy OLR as their official show.

2266
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:22,320
Like I think we'd be really stupid and naive to think something like that would actually

2267
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,320
happen.

2268
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:26,620
I, I just, we've been, I totally think it's going to happen.

2269
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:30,400
If it was going to happen, it would have happened in 2006 when podcasting first broke.

2270
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:35,000
If it had happened and you guys didn't take the money, I would kill all three of you.

2271
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Hold on, hold on.

2272
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Dan, Dan, say that on the mic.

2273
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,500
I think he might've got picked up, but, uh, my husband likes to just come in here and

2274
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:42,500
shout things.

2275
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:44,320
He said, if we didn't take the money, he'd kill all of us.

2276
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:46,200
Um, I, I will say this though.

2277
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:50,900
There's definitely, I think, I think one thing we always want to make sure we do here at

2278
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:54,100
orange launch rate is we don't want to rest on our laurels too much.

2279
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:58,540
And I think if there's ways we can push things forward and push ourselves more and push the

2280
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:01,020
hobby forward, we're going to try and do that.

2281
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:06,120
So I'm not saying anything, but trust me, we're always thinking about how can things

2282
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:09,300
be even better than they are right now?

2283
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:16,380
But on our terms, very important on our terms.

2284
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:18,020
Yes.

2285
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,020
Next email.

2286
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:20,020
Yes.

2287
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:23,020
Destructoid article that's linked by Rob-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

2288
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:25,820
I was getting my b-b-b-b's ready.

2289
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:28,980
Originally scheduled for launch sometime this month, Nintendo has pushed back the already

2290
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:33,420
late release because it should have been ready when the damn system was out of the 3DS eShop

2291
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:34,420
until June.

2292
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:37,700
According to the company, North America will get it June 6th and Japan will get it June

2293
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:38,700
7th.

2294
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:39,700
So hey, we get it first.

2295
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:40,700
Neener.

2296
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:43,220
Well, technically it's sort of at the same time.

2297
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:48,140
I was emailing a friend about this and I also mentioned the big three addresses by Microsoft,

2298
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:49,780
Sony and Nintendo respectively.

2299
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:56,740
I realized that the eShop will open the day Microsoft and Sony talk, open on the day Microsoft

2300
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:59,260
and Sony talk June 6th, USA, June 7th, Japan.

2301
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:00,260
How clever.

2302
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:03,900
Rob-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

2303
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,240
Last two emails.

2304
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,500
I'm glad they finally got it back up.

2305
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:10,180
This is called thoughts on PSN.

2306
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:12,180
They got it up.

2307
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:17,100
While it's still unclear if their security was up to standard before, I'm confident

2308
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:19,420
slash hopeful it will be now.

2309
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:21,400
Another incident like this would be devastating.

2310
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:24,620
On the other hand, once it's fully up and running, many gamers will be quick to simply

2311
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:26,580
go back to their favorite games.

2312
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:30,220
Personally, I had other options so I didn't feel very put out when it was done.

2313
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:31,220
Same here.

2314
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,540
And got a bit lucky that I picked up Portal 2 and had it linked and downloaded to Steam

2315
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:38,140
before the disaster.

2316
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:42,980
Michael Pacher did a 24 plus minute video on how this will impact Sony.

2317
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:44,300
A very interesting watch.

2318
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:48,780
He certainly feels that while they lost money slash sales, they'll be fine.

2319
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:51,040
Here's the link and I will copy it in the chat room.

2320
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:57,580
But for those listening, it's game trailers dot com slash video slash episode dash 215

2321
02:03:57,580 --> 02:03:58,580
dash patch.

2322
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:01,400
I guess P-A-C-H is how it's written on there.

2323
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,500
Dash attack slash seven one three nine zero zero.

2324
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:07,260
So they're giving the analysts video time now too.

2325
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:10,980
I assume if you just go to game trailers dot com and search for his name you'll find it.

2326
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:14,020
Well yeah, but I'm thorough.

2327
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:18,580
I don't want to be a hater, but how is this guy any different from the indie podcast out

2328
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:20,400
there and all the speculation they do?

2329
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,260
Like I realize maybe he went to school or whatever.

2330
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:26,540
I got played by Morgan, what was it, uh, Webb Brish or whatever.

2331
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:28,200
I'm really not trying to be a hater.

2332
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:31,620
Like everybody's gotta make a living, I get that, but I don't, like, why is his opinion

2333
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:32,620
so important?

2334
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:33,620
Dude, the guy is wrong.

2335
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:35,980
More times than he's right.

2336
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:37,980
And no one seems to remember that.

2337
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,980
I'm just reading the email.

2338
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:39,980
No, I know, I know.

2339
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:40,980
I'm responding to the email.

2340
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:41,980
Take care.

2341
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:42,980
Listen to the podcast every week.

2342
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:43,980
Keep up the good work.

2343
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:44,980
And it's from Sepwin.

2344
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:47,540
I will say this though, I actually, I do kind of agree.

2345
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:49,940
I think Sony is going to recover from it in the long run.

2346
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:52,580
Um, I think they're going to feel a lot of hurt.

2347
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:56,380
And the real question might be, is Sony going to find this worth it to do it all over again

2348
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:57,940
with PlayStation 4?

2349
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:01,700
Uh, but I think at the end of the day, yes.

2350
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:07,700
I think, I think they will recover if Apple recovered from the antenna thing, if Microsoft

2351
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:11,940
recovered from the red ring thing, if you know, they'll, they'll come back.

2352
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:12,940
It's Sony.

2353
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:16,860
Do you know they've already got a business, they've already adjusted their business model

2354
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:17,860
to accommodate.

2355
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:26,500
Also, uh, Bobby, did you know that PSN is back up and did you know that it still does

2356
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,820
not deliver tacos?

2357
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:28,820
I am sad.

2358
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:32,060
All caps, brown face, all caps, Bobby.

2359
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:33,060
I had to yell.

2360
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:37,380
That possibly is the best email ever actually.

2361
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:38,380
That is very sad.

2362
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:39,380
How was my caps lock voice?

2363
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:42,020
I want tacos as part of my PlayStation severance package.

2364
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:43,020
Can we get on that?

2365
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:44,580
I only got four emails, Rob.

2366
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:46,260
Well, we need more emails.

2367
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:47,260
No talk.

2368
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:49,980
That's why you didn't get tacos tonight.

2369
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:53,540
Send me more emails so that Rob will get me another taco.

2370
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:57,540
Send me emails so that dark soccer buys me a taco.

2371
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:02,100
I'll buy you a taco if you buy me a taco.

2372
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:04,380
Dan says he's going to make tacos next week.

2373
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,380
Awesome.

2374
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:06,380
Rad.

2375
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:09,000
All right, we're almost to the Skype line.

2376
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,860
Not just yet, but we will be there in just a moment.

2377
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:14,460
One eight seven seven game O L R or I use your name on Skype is orange lounge radio,

2378
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:17,660
but first two more stories for you.

2379
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:19,060
Mm hmm.

2380
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:24,620
Um, so this is kind of neat though there, you know, as part of like the Xbox indie service,

2381
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:28,900
it's been very unpredictable when games are going to be released on there.

2382
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:33,240
It's kind of like, well, they're up for review now, so, uh, it should be out hopefully soon.

2383
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:38,180
Well now actual indie studios can pick their publishing dates.

2384
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:44,860
Apparently, um, they will allow, um, people to be able to market their games actually

2385
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:50,780
have some sort of, um, set release date once it's past peer review.

2386
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:53,540
And um, that's kind of neat I guess.

2387
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:59,700
And I guess, uh, you know, such like events like the indie games winter uprising will

2388
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:07,220
be more coordinated and, uh, you know, cause I guess some of their titles were, um, missed

2389
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:11,140
on that because of the release date whole thing.

2390
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:17,700
Um, uh, they're saying also it's kind of a mixed to positive, um, feedback according

2391
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:19,380
to the development community.

2392
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:25,580
Um, some people like the decision and then, uh, saying that the chance to schedule a release

2393
02:07:25,580 --> 02:07:28,260
helps them plan the game promotion more sensibly.

2394
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:33,180
Others noted that scheduling would, uh, likely lead to an open stampede to release on specific

2395
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:40,260
days like Friday and a game of chicken trying to figure out, uh, the best time.

2396
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:44,540
I think that's not really going to be an issue, but it's still kind of neat.

2397
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:48,140
Uh, just a note for our live listeners, yeah, we're aware it looks like the stream is skipping

2398
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:49,140
a little bit.

2399
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:51,820
Anyway, looking at the upload numbers, it looks okay now.

2400
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:56,540
It's not stalling like it was, but everybody in the studio make sure all your excess transmits

2401
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:58,340
are turned off cause we're skipping right now.

2402
02:07:58,340 --> 02:07:59,940
It's having trouble uploading everything.

2403
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:03,020
It looks like we're okay right now looking at the numbers, but we were having a skippy

2404
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:04,740
period for a minute there.

2405
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:08,500
Anyhow, um, moving on, but otherwise there's not a lot we can do about it.

2406
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,880
If the cable's not going to cooperate, then it's not going to cooperate.

2407
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,900
So we move on with one last story here tonight before we go to the Skype line, which if we're

2408
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:17,500
still skipping is really going to be a hoot and holler tonight.

2409
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:21,700
Uh, this is about Chrono Trigger, which funny enough Dark Soccer brought up earlier in the

2410
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:22,700
show.

2411
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:23,700
Chrono Trigger, guess what?

2412
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:25,340
It's coming out on Virtual Console.

2413
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:30,100
So if you do not own the Super Nintendo cartridge or you don't want to pay $70 for it or however

2414
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:34,660
much it goes for on eBay these days, you'll be able to pick up your copy on May 16th.

2415
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:39,060
Uh, don't know exactly how much, that's tomorrow, shit, probably by the time most of you are

2416
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:40,060
hearing this show.

2417
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:41,060
Uh, it's not online.

2418
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:43,060
If we hadn't learned that, are we?

2419
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:48,660
Uh, anyhow, uh, it's just a straight up release of the Super Nintendo version, so don't expect

2420
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:50,500
anything fabulous to be changed.

2421
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:53,740
That means you're not going to have the extra dungeons and stuff in the DS version, but

2422
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:54,740
there you go.

2423
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:55,740
It is coming out.

2424
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:59,500
No price announced yet, but everybody is speculating it will be 900 Wii Points.

2425
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:04,660
800 for a Super Nintendo game and that 100 point premium for the special of the special

2426
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:07,700
games, which honestly Chrono Trigger, it's probably worth it.

2427
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:10,340
So, uh, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people checking that out.

2428
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:13,900
And especially like if you were too young to remember Chrono Trigger, just never got

2429
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:17,140
a chance to play it back in the day, you really should check it out.

2430
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:21,460
Like I know, I know I sometimes hate on it on the show cause I don't think it's the best

2431
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:27,140
Super Nintendo RPG, but, cause I just, I love Final Fantasy 3 too god damn much, but, or

2432
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:28,820
6, whatever you want to call it.

2433
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:30,860
But uh, it's, it's really good.

2434
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:31,860
It's really good.

2435
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:32,860
You want to know what's great?

2436
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,860
Huh?

2437
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:40,700
Now keep in mind that I got the game in 95, 96 when it came out for, well, first of all,

2438
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:42,820
my friend loaned it to me and then he moved.

2439
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:45,540
Um, my save file is still intact.

2440
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,540
Oh wow.

2441
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:47,540
Yeah.

2442
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:51,980
Well, you know, a lot about those batteries were only ever guaranteed to last five years,

2443
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:55,180
but most people I know with old NES cartridges, those things still work.

2444
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:56,180
Yeah.

2445
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:57,180
It's just a lithium battery.

2446
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:58,180
It depends on how much you used it.

2447
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:59,180
Yeah.

2448
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:01,180
I mean, if you, as long as you don't have the game on 24 seven.

2449
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:02,180
Yeah.

2450
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:03,180
So interesting.

2451
02:10:03,180 --> 02:10:04,180
Interesting.

2452
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:07,820
Now our Saturn batteries, however, have burned and burned and burned and burned.

2453
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:08,820
All right.

2454
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:12,860
We are going to now open the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username

2455
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:14,220
on Skype is orange launch radio.

2456
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:18,700
I'm going to really hope our live transmit issues don't get in the way, but the sky,

2457
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:23,500
excuse me, hiccups, the Skype radio's worst enemy, uh, the Skype line is now open for

2458
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:24,500
your calls.

2459
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,780
If you want to give feedback on any of tonight's topics or anything else that might be on your

2460
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:28,780
mind, look at that.

2461
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:29,900
It's already ringing.

2462
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:33,780
We will of course also go to look you as some last minute stories in between calls higher

2463
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:34,780
on orange launch radio.

2464
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:35,780
Who's this?

2465
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:36,780
It's the one and only Ron.

2466
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:37,780
How's everyone?

2467
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,780
Who else gets in first on this show?

2468
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,780
How are you?

2469
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:40,780
Rama?

2470
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:41,780
I'm pretty good.

2471
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,780
I'm pretty, pretty happy.

2472
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:43,780
That's all.

2473
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:44,780
You're happy.

2474
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:45,780
Why are you happy?

2475
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,780
There's no start a new job.

2476
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,780
Come tomorrow.

2477
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:48,780
Oh, well that's a reason to be happy.

2478
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:49,780
Congratulations.

2479
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:50,780
Thank you.

2480
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:51,780
What kind of job are you going to be doing?

2481
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:54,820
If you don't mind me asking, I'll still be doing tech support in the school district,

2482
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:58,540
but with a different company with a lot more pay and better benefits.

2483
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:01,180
Well, more pay and better benefits are always a good thing.

2484
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,180
Congrats.

2485
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:03,180
Thanks.

2486
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:04,180
Awesome.

2487
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:05,180
So what's in your mind tonight gaming wise?

2488
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:06,180
Oh, a couple of things.

2489
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:10,980
I wanted to kind of finish up what I was trying to talk about last week about Nintendo and

2490
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:12,540
their touchscreen controllers.

2491
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:13,540
Yeah.

2492
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:17,900
I could tell you that they won't be that expensive because touchscreens are not that expensive

2493
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:18,900
per se.

2494
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:22,540
It's the software that powers it that makes it more expensive.

2495
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:26,460
What I see is it's probably like a simple controller with a touchscreen in the middle

2496
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:31,260
of it preset for certain buttons to do certain things in according to the way the game is

2497
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:32,380
going to be.

2498
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,580
I can actually agree with that.

2499
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:36,420
It seems like almost everything has a touchscreen in this day and age.

2500
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:39,580
Like pretty much every smartphone these days has one.

2501
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:43,020
Like I was talking about earlier when we were talking about the Nintendo, the new Nintendo

2502
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:49,780
console in the first place, the touchscreens on the printer devices, those things.

2503
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:50,780
Yeah.

2504
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:51,780
I've seen those.

2505
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:52,780
Yeah.

2506
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,700
I don't think the touchscreens will be that expensive.

2507
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:58,660
It's just, you know, all this other stuff too, you know?

2508
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:00,020
Pretty much.

2509
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:03,140
So what do you, what are your expectations for the new Nintendo console?

2510
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:05,860
We are only three weeks away from E3.

2511
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:11,940
They're saying it's going to be on par with the 360 and the PS3.

2512
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:17,060
Just show me what it can do and what, and the features.

2513
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:18,060
That's it.

2514
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:20,260
I'm a very simple person with basic needs.

2515
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:23,860
I mean, if there's going to be some great gaming on it, I will pick up the console.

2516
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:31,300
If it's going to be the Wii 2nd gen with more shovelware, it can stay on the shelf and collect

2517
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:32,860
more dust.

2518
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:38,380
Well, you know the golden rule of OLR, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

2519
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:39,380
Yes, indeed.

2520
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:41,060
That's the problem with the 3DS right now too.

2521
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:44,620
You know I left my 3DS here after the show last week and never bothered to come get it.

2522
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,620
Well, actually that's a lie.

2523
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:47,260
I did try to come by Monday, but nobody was here.

2524
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:49,260
So, because I was in the neighborhood.

2525
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:50,260
But yeah.

2526
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:51,260
Quite understandable.

2527
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,260
I didn't really miss it that much.

2528
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:57,420
I took mine out of my bag because I didn't like lugging it back and forth around because

2529
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:58,420
I'm not using it.

2530
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:00,220
Now I have no one to street pass with.

2531
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:02,220
Oh, darn.

2532
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:03,220
You're going to street pass with me.

2533
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:04,220
Take it to E3.

2534
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:06,500
Try to street pass with people there.

2535
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:07,500
You're going to loiter outside E3?

2536
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:08,500
Bobby will street pass with me.

2537
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:12,100
Yeah, I'm going to loiter outside E3 just to street pass.

2538
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:14,440
I'm just going to walk around with a big cardboard sign.

2539
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:15,620
I should do this.

2540
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,260
Big cardboard sign.

2541
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:19,780
Media not good enough to get into E3.

2542
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:21,780
Please street pass with me.

2543
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:24,780
That would be fun.

2544
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:25,780
Wow.

2545
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,780
Anyhow.

2546
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:30,780
Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

2547
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:34,780
Yes, in regards to PAX East 2012.

2548
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:35,780
Yes.

2549
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:36,780
Okay.

2550
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:42,380
I expect this to be announced soon, but I don't know if you know, but next year PAX

2551
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:45,180
East is the same weekend as Anime Boston.

2552
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:46,180
Oh, snap.

2553
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:47,180
City of City.

2554
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:48,940
Two separate convention centers.

2555
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:49,940
Oh my god.

2556
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:50,940
Yeah.

2557
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:54,860
That's going to be a mess.

2558
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:56,420
That is bad planning.

2559
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:57,420
I'm sorry.

2560
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:59,420
That is bad planning.

2561
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:06,260
Yeah, I know, but the problem is sometimes when these convention centers have these dates,

2562
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:08,220
it's like take it or leave it, you know?

2563
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:12,920
So that's probably what it boiled down to.

2564
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,180
But here's the thing.

2565
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:19,380
This was announced at Anime Boston's Masquerade, and I actually talked to a few people that

2566
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:23,820
are staff and that was there that actually verified this, but it will not surprise me

2567
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,520
if this changes.

2568
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:31,700
They made the announcement that if you purchase a pass for Anime Boston 2012, it is good for

2569
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:36,900
entrance to PAX East 2012 as well, and they will have shuttle buses going between both

2570
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:39,740
convention centers.

2571
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:45,020
That's a little weird to me considering the attendance caps that PAX keeps hitting.

2572
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:50,220
Like why would you want to, you know, because if everybody who goes to Anime Boston gets

2573
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:54,900
a free pass into PAX, that's less people that can go to PAX.

2574
02:14:54,900 --> 02:15:00,220
So that seems like, if I were on the PAX, I wouldn't agree to that if I were behind

2575
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:01,220
that show.

2576
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:05,860
I figure it's like, you know, you got so many gamers going to this convention, you got so

2577
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:10,420
many anime fans going to this convention, give them a free pass, check out the other

2578
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:11,420
side per se.

2579
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:15,660
Well then why not, is the other half going to be true too?

2580
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,820
It would not surprise me if it is.

2581
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:21,980
But correct me if I'm wrong, Anime Boston is going to be at the old convention center,

2582
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:22,980
the Heinz, right?

2583
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:23,980
Yes.

2584
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:27,940
And then the Uber one that PAX is at this year is where PAX will be.

2585
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:31,500
What if everybody decides to go to Anime Boston one of those days, I mean that Heinz place

2586
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:33,500
is going to collapse?

2587
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:39,860
Honestly, with the numbers that PAX East generates, I find that hard to believe because I'm planning

2588
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:41,820
to do PAX East instead.

2589
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:48,020
And knowing how some fans are, how lazy they can be per se, no offense, but to be perfectly

2590
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:52,800
honest, I don't think a lot of them are going to take shuttle buses to go 15 minutes across

2591
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:55,100
town to another convention and then come back.

2592
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:58,620
One of the two needs to move, end of story, one of the two needs to move.

2593
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:00,580
They shouldn't be the same weekend.

2594
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:05,140
I know, but this is what I'm hearing from a lot of my sources, that this could be the

2595
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:07,220
end for AB, who knows?

2596
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:10,560
Well then move, you know?

2597
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,220
I don't know, that's going to be tricky.

2598
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:15,940
It's going to be an interesting weekend next year.

2599
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:19,500
I know, I am curiously seeing how this is all going to play out.

2600
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:24,100
It's still a long ways away all things considered, so some things may change, we'll see.

2601
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:27,020
I don't doubt your sources, but I'm still skeptical.

2602
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:30,340
It seems like wishful thinking on Anime Boston's part.

2603
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:34,100
I know, it wouldn't surprise me as if AB says this is what they're going to do.

2604
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:38,180
Wouldn't surprise me if PAX comes out and says, yeah, you buy one of our badges, it's

2605
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,180
not good for AB.

2606
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:45,620
Maybe they're trying to be all buddy-buddy, friendly-friendly, because you have two different

2607
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:50,340
convention companies in the same town fighting for top dog, or in this case, a one-legged

2608
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:51,340
ass-kicking contest.

2609
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:55,680
Yeah, and I was going to say, you'd think in most situations the two would be fighting

2610
02:16:55,680 --> 02:17:01,380
each other, but I'm sorry Anime fans, PAX, with the people that come as far away as they

2611
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:06,620
do, you know, all the way from like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and all like the southern

2612
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:11,220
East States, you know, because that's still the closest thing they've got, I'm sorry,

2613
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:14,580
Anime Boston's going to get their ass handed to them if they stay that same weekend.

2614
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:18,160
And you're absolutely right, but the funny thing is, there are people that travel as

2615
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:21,780
far south as Florida and Texas that come up to Anime Boston.

2616
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:22,780
Why do they do it?

2617
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:23,780
For the guests.

2618
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:27,620
But for next year, you may travel way across the country for the guests, but as for me,

2619
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:30,500
I'll travel way across the country to check out these great games.

2620
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,500
Yeah.

2621
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,500
True.

2622
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:33,500
True.

2623
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:34,500
All right.

2624
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:35,500
Yes.

2625
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,500
We gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much, buddy.

2626
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:37,500
Hey, no problem, dude.

2627
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:38,500
Take care.

2628
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:39,500
Bye.

2629
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:40,500
All right.

2630
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:41,500
Later.

2631
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:42,500
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us

2632
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:43,500
a call.

2633
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,700
Uh, Loki, any last minute stories while we wait for a call?

2634
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:46,220
Yeah, there's some weird stuff.

2635
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:47,940
Um, this is kind of funny.

2636
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:50,380
I don't know if you remember the game YouStar2.

2637
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:56,180
It was kind of like a karaoke sort of game where you reenact scenes for movies and stuff

2638
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:57,180
like that.

2639
02:17:57,180 --> 02:17:58,180
Looked dumb.

2640
02:17:58,180 --> 02:17:59,380
Yes, it was terrible, actually.

2641
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:03,900
I've played it, but there's some free download content coming out, and guess what it ties

2642
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:04,900
into?

2643
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:05,900
What?

2644
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:06,900
The Royal Wedding.

2645
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:07,900
That's ridiculous.

2646
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:11,140
Yes, it will allow players to replace either Prince William or Kate Milton, so you could

2647
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:12,140
do a...

2648
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:13,140
Wait, I can be Princess Kate?

2649
02:18:13,140 --> 02:18:14,500
You can be Princess Kate, yes.

2650
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:15,500
I mean, he's actually...

2651
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:18,980
In their first public kiss following the Royal Wedding.

2652
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:19,980
Wow.

2653
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:21,260
It says the scene's offered free.

2654
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:23,820
Clearly, I attempt to subvert otherwise rational people.

2655
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:25,300
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

2656
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:26,300
Let's go back to the phones.

2657
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:27,300
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2658
02:18:27,300 --> 02:18:28,300
Who's this?

2659
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:30,060
Oh, I thought I had a call.

2660
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:31,060
I guess not.

2661
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:32,060
I guess I missed it.

2662
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:33,060
Sorry.

2663
02:18:33,060 --> 02:18:34,060
Keep going.

2664
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:37,380
Um, so yeah, apparently there's gonna be some other footage and stuff that's available.

2665
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:40,340
But seriously, though, I've played USAR 2.

2666
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:45,740
It's a cool concept, but it's so terribly executed.

2667
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:46,980
It's such a terrible game.

2668
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:50,780
My favorite is how the camera cannot frame you properly.

2669
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:55,940
I remember my coworker playing it, though.

2670
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:59,900
He's just like, he's doing this scene and it's framed so his head's at the very bottom

2671
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:00,900
of the screen.

2672
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:01,900
It's hilarious.

2673
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,900
Alright, let me go to the phones.

2674
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:03,900
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2675
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:04,900
Who's this?

2676
02:19:04,900 --> 02:19:05,900
It's Death Wishing.

2677
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:07,780
Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

2678
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:13,300
I'm playing a very amazing gem of a game that people need to start playing again.

2679
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:14,300
What's that?

2680
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:15,300
Freelancer.

2681
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:18,380
I have not even think I've heard of this.

2682
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:19,380
What is this game?

2683
02:19:19,380 --> 02:19:28,460
It's a PC game from 2004, I believe, and it's kind of say, like, Eve Online, minus being

2684
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,460
an MMORPG.

2685
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:33,580
But you can play it with, like, 200 people online at once, and you do missions.

2686
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:36,940
Think, like, Neverwinter Nights kind of style, you know, you can do missions and stuff, all

2687
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:37,940
that, but it's space combat.

2688
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:38,940
Oh, yeah, okay.

2689
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:41,940
It's pretty fun.

2690
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:53,020
Anyways, that Nintendo thing, I'm kind of looking, I'm totally seeing fail in the future.

2691
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:54,020
Why so negative?

2692
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:59,180
Well, it's like, they're saying, oh, it's going to be, like, on par with PS3, Xbox 360,

2693
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:02,300
but then you see the thing about, oh, we're going to be inventing some new peripheral

2694
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:06,620
where you can, like, feel things, I'm like, oh, great, so now we're going to have a bunch

2695
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:09,620
of games instead of playing Wii Tennis, we're going to be playing Wii Tennis where we can

2696
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:11,780
feel like we're holding the ball, or...

2697
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:15,580
I kind of think the feel thing is bullshit.

2698
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:19,200
I truly think the feel thing is bullshit, that's not coming from the same source that

2699
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:24,320
originally leaked the news about the Nintendo Wii Next system and the whole, that came from

2700
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,320
a different source.

2701
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:28,920
I really think the feel, I think the feel stuff holds about as much weight as the fact

2702
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:36,300
that the revolution was going to project 3D graphics, remember that?

2703
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:40,940
So yes, I think there's a new Nintendo system, yes, I think the controller does have some

2704
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:45,100
type of video screen that probably has a touch on it, or at least some type of touch, I mean,

2705
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:50,740
who's to say that feel isn't just the fact that you're touching a screen?

2706
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:55,180
You know, that's still feel, it doesn't mean that you're getting that tactile response

2707
02:20:55,180 --> 02:21:01,260
of, like, feeling snakeskin and petting a snake, so I don't know, I kind of think the

2708
02:21:01,260 --> 02:21:07,900
whole, like, touch, I think that's just, like, weird, crazy fanboy bullshit, I truly do.

2709
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:16,580
Um, sorry, so I'm going down here, over here, uh, I bet you don't frickin' tend to think

2710
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:20,480
for us, it's also going to have a button that says, give Nintendo money, because anything

2711
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:25,180
in there is going to put money regardless, it's going to sell, I know for a fact it will.

2712
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:26,180
Well, which-

2713
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:29,100
They got the soccer mom market on the Nintendo Wii.

2714
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:30,540
Yeah, but will you buy one?

2715
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:32,780
Do you own a Wii?

2716
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:38,620
Uh, I owned a Wii, I had it for three months, and then I was like, wow, this is the most

2717
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:42,020
gimmicky piece of crap I've ever owned, and I gave it to my cousins because I didn't want

2718
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:45,140
to sell it, so I gave it to some kids, I wouldn't use it.

2719
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:48,300
Do you worry you might make the same mistake with the new Nintendo system?

2720
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:53,820
Uh, I know I won't because I'm just going to switch to PC Master Race.

2721
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:54,880
Are you sure, though?

2722
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:58,180
What could Nintendo announce on this thing that would make you be like, maybe I should

2723
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:00,180
get this?

2724
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:06,340
Um, that they're actually going to make a new Goldeneye that isn't stupid and handle

2725
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:09,420
like ass, and my ship just blew up.

2726
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:12,700
Well, have fun in the PC Master Race.

2727
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:18,940
Alright, alright Death Wishing, we'll be looking for your reactions after E3.

2728
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:25,140
Alright, well, um, have fun with whoever's coming, like I was going to PAX East or whatever,

2729
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,540
have fun with all the Japanese Wii, there's an anime.

2730
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:28,540
We will.

2731
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:29,540
Alright.

2732
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:30,540
Bye.

2733
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:31,540
Bye.

2734
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:35,180
There's going to be some great, like, crossover interviews and things like that.

2735
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:39,620
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2736
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:42,620
I really think Anime Boston's going to be forced to move weekends.

2737
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:47,900
I know, you know, I know there's only so much convention center space and so on, but, uh,

2738
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:50,060
think outside the box, people.

2739
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:54,020
Anyhow, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2740
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:57,140
In the meantime, more last minute stories from Loki!

2741
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:02,900
There's an NES cartridge that's being developed that will turn your NES into a MIDI synthesizer.

2742
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:09,060
It's called Chip Maestro, it was actually part of a Kickstarter program, and for $50

2743
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:12,940
you can grab one of these cartridges that plugs into a MIDI keyboard and you can start

2744
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:21,700
creating your own 8-bit sounding music using a keyboard, it's kind of cool.

2745
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:29,060
And then, of course, there is a new Xbox Live and PlayStation Network game that's been announced.

2746
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:32,180
Jeremy McGrath Offroad.

2747
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:37,180
No word on what the game is exactly, obviously it's going to be a Baja Racing type of game.

2748
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:42,980
It's actually being developed, I guess, from the people that did Baja Edge of Control for

2749
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:48,620
THQ, and I guess they've also done some work on the MX vs ATV series, so they've got a

2750
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:52,820
good pedigree there, but don't really know that many details about it.

2751
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:58,100
People are kind of hoping that it's maybe a spiritual successor to Ivan Ironman Stewart's

2752
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:59,460
Offroad Racing game.

2753
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:00,460
That game was fucking awesome.

2754
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:02,500
Alright, let's go to the phones, we've got another call coming in.

2755
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:03,500
1877, I'm sorry.

2756
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:05,500
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2757
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:07,500
You've already called the number.

2758
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:10,180
Hey guys, it's CD Thunder.

2759
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:15,100
CD Thunder, what's in your mind?

2760
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:18,460
Well I have a couple of things to talk to you about.

2761
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:21,940
Go for it.

2762
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:24,180
There must be like hella lag going on here.

2763
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:25,180
Go ahead.

2764
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:32,900
Well, let's see, the two games I want to talk about, Perfect Dark and GoldenEye 007.

2765
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:34,820
Some classic games?

2766
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:36,380
Go for it.

2767
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:44,820
Well, I like them both, and the Perfect Dark is basically like a space version of the GoldenEye

2768
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:48,300
007, if you know what I'm talking about.

2769
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:49,380
These are some old games.

2770
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:53,020
These games have been out a very long time.

2771
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:56,780
Are you just kind of getting around to playing classics, like rediscovering old stuff, kind

2772
02:24:56,780 --> 02:25:00,140
of like our last caller's playing some PC game from 2004?

2773
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:02,580
Are you rediscovering classic games?

2774
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:08,340
Are you finding these through the new versions of GoldenEye or Perfect Dark Zero, or what

2775
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:11,340
has peaked your interest in these games?

2776
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:18,100
It's GoldenEye 007, talking about that, is actually one of the games we got when we got

2777
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:21,940
the Nintendo 64 for the first time.

2778
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:29,420
Oh, you're the guy that called in a few weeks ago, and you just recently got a 64, right?

2779
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:35,220
Actually not recently, but a few Christmases ago or something.

2780
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:38,060
You don't have a lot of the new systems, right?

2781
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:39,060
You play on like...

2782
02:25:39,060 --> 02:25:40,060
No, uh-uh.

2783
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:41,060
Okay, I remember you.

2784
02:25:41,060 --> 02:25:44,020
All right, you've got like all the classic stuff in your house.

2785
02:25:44,020 --> 02:25:45,020
So you're...

2786
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:47,260
Yeah, a lot of the good stuff.

2787
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:51,020
You're gaming in a time capsule, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because there's

2788
02:25:51,020 --> 02:25:54,980
a lot of shit out there right now, and so it really gives you time to focus on the classics.

2789
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:59,860
So you're kind of rediscovering a lot of these games like they're totally new, right?

2790
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,860
Yeah.

2791
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:03,100
That's pretty cool, actually.

2792
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:08,020
I'd like to be living in a bubble like that sometimes, because there's a lot of real crap

2793
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:09,020
out there right now.

2794
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:13,380
All right, well tell us, how was it playing Perfect Dark and GoldenEye for the first time?

2795
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:18,900
Well, GoldenEye I actually had a lot of fun with, I like the James Bond.

2796
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:23,900
So since it was James Bond, I really liked it a lot, and well, a lot of the levels are

2797
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:27,860
really difficult.

2798
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:33,300
And with Perfect Dark, it's space...

2799
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:34,580
Go ahead.

2800
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:36,180
Oh.

2801
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:43,340
And the Perfect Dark is basically like a space age version of GoldenEye 007, except he plays

2802
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:49,820
a woman, and you have on-screen reloads, but in the GoldenEye 007, you have off-screen

2803
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:50,820
reloads.

2804
02:26:50,820 --> 02:26:52,820
And the bitch can't jump.

2805
02:26:52,820 --> 02:26:56,660
Yeah, she can jump only a little bit.

2806
02:26:56,660 --> 02:26:59,680
You know, they made a new GoldenEye, in fact it's funny, I think one of the previous callers

2807
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:03,740
brought this up, they made a new GoldenEye last year on the Wii, so you'll be playing

2808
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:05,460
that in about 2018.

2809
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:10,540
But they made this game, and a lot of people aren't really fans of it, like they say it

2810
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:13,700
blows, it isn't like the original at all.

2811
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:16,640
Why do you think people are so partial to the original GoldenEye?

2812
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:20,820
What is the charm in the original GoldenEye?

2813
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:26,780
Well because, it could be maybe because they like the movie, and because of that they like

2814
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:35,420
the game, and since they remade the GoldenEye 007 on the Wii with Daniel Craig, they're

2815
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:39,540
thinking it's a reboot of the original, so maybe that's one of the reasons.

2816
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:40,540
Alright.

2817
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:44,260
Well buddy, we're gonna let you go to take some more calls, but I'm just gonna leave

2818
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:48,300
you with this, don't bother with Majora's Mask, it's not nearly as good as Ocarina of

2819
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:49,300
Time.

2820
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:50,300
Just so you know.

2821
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:51,300
Alright.

2822
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:52,300
Alright, take care buddy.

2823
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:53,300
Thanks, you too.

2824
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:59,900
1877 game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2825
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:05,100
You know, I really do mean it, sometimes I kind of wish I could just kind of go back

2826
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:08,220
in gaming, like seriously, Super Nintendo?

2827
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:13,420
There's so many good games on that, I probably still have yet to play, alright.

2828
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:17,580
And some folks in chatroom vehemently disagree with me, DarkToaGak in chat says, Majora's

2829
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:20,660
Mask is orgasmic, what the hell is Sky talking about?

2830
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:22,220
Majora's Mask was annoying.

2831
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:23,220
I didn't like it.

2832
02:28:23,220 --> 02:28:26,940
Of course I always thought that Ocarina of Time was a little bit overrated too.

2833
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:29,620
I liked Ocarina, but my favorite's Silling to the Past.

2834
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:32,900
Alright, let's wrap up with last minute stories, Loki, if you had anything else.

2835
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:35,220
His last minute story is Portal.

2836
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:36,740
I had nothing else.

2837
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:38,160
Oh okay.

2838
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:44,140
And I'm getting a private message about Square Enix might be going bankrupt, and I do remember

2839
02:28:44,140 --> 02:28:48,660
reading the article online, I don't have it up in front of me, but I think they reported

2840
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:51,240
huge losses recently.

2841
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:55,540
And I assumed a lot, well I don't, like I think part of it they were trying to say might

2842
02:28:55,540 --> 02:28:59,700
have been the tsunami, which makes sense, you know, obviously everybody heard from that.

2843
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:06,020
But I think a really large part of it that I don't think was really announced in the

2844
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:10,820
story was the utter dismal cataclysmic failure of Final Fantasy XIV.

2845
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:15,180
Because keep in mind, that game was supposed to come out on Playstation 3 by now, but it

2846
02:29:15,180 --> 02:29:16,180
hasn't.

2847
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:21,980
So yeah, I think Square's probably way overestimated what they were going to make last quarter,

2848
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:25,740
and I think a lot of that has to do with Final Fantasy XIV, honestly.

2849
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:29,700
Oh, I'm getting more information, thank you to the person who's messaging me right now,

2850
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:34,540
let me pull up this link in our little browser box here.

2851
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:37,740
Oh, and of course it's all in Japanese, I can't read that.

2852
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:40,980
That's why you should use Nifty.

2853
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:48,420
No, I, oh yeah, I could use Nifty, hold on, or I could use Google Translate.

2854
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:52,900
But Final Fantasy XIII apparently plays into this as well, Final Fantasy XIII not quite

2855
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:57,780
selling as much as they thought.

2856
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:00,780
I'm translating it now.

2857
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:06,460
16 billion yen, extraordinary loss and damage.

2858
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:09,020
The earthquake did stop them to some development.

2859
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:13,620
Ah, they are attributing this to Final Fantasy XIV and postponing that.

2860
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:21,220
Let's see, they're thinking though the, they say the business environment is rapidly changing.

2861
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:29,100
Yeah, they do cite Final Fantasy XIV multiple times here.

2862
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:34,460
Final Fantasy XI, I guess it talks about that Final Fantasy XIV wasn't the same quality

2863
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:41,100
as Final Fantasy XI, and they actually apologized for the unusual situation it has become.

2864
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:42,100
Yikes.

2865
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:47,980
Well, I, we told you when we first reported on Final Fantasy XIV, heads were gonna roll,

2866
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:52,540
so Final Fantasy XIII-2 it sounds like might be delayed too.

2867
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:55,580
Good times!

2868
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:58,900
Alright that's gonna do it for Last Minute Stories tonight, I think we're all done.

2869
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:02,660
So this is the part we go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but first I'm gonna thank

2870
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:05,740
all you guys for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight, and remember if you like what

2871
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:09,580
you heard, you know, we got into this during the email bag, but we don't have big corporate

2872
02:31:09,580 --> 02:31:14,100
dollars behind the show, we do this just because we like having a show, hanging out with each

2873
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:17,300
other and hanging out with you guys every Sunday, so tell some friends to come join

2874
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:18,300
the party.

2875
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:19,300
Lots of them.

2876
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:20,300
Open invite.

2877
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:24,260
So yeah, we hope to hear from your friends, tell a couple friends about the show, and

2878
02:31:24,260 --> 02:31:28,260
spread the word about Orange Launch Radio, and you can keep having the show for free.

2879
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:29,660
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2880
02:31:29,660 --> 02:31:32,420
I'll start with the portal-loving Loki.

2881
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:33,900
Your final thought tonight.

2882
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:37,820
Uh, my final thought is we never did it after Use of the Week.

2883
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:38,820
No we didn't.

2884
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:39,820
Oh we didn't!

2885
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:41,820
Shit, I guess we should do that now then, shouldn't we?

2886
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:42,820
I don't care.

2887
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:43,820
You don't care?

2888
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:44,820
No, we can do it.

2889
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:45,820
Alright, here they go.

2890
02:31:45,820 --> 02:32:03,700
F.U. to this little patch of Eximo on my right hand ring finger.

2891
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:04,700
The end.

2892
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:05,700
Loki?

2893
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:10,780
F.U. to the woman that wasn't watching where she was driving and hit the back of my car.

2894
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:11,780
Doh!

2895
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:14,300
Um, F.U. to hangovers.

2896
02:32:14,300 --> 02:32:16,300
I had a bad one this morning.

2897
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:18,500
Alright there you go, Loki, we did the F.U.s of the week.

2898
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:20,620
Uh, my F.U. of the week, er, not my F.U.

2899
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:27,620
My final thought, um, is weekend's already over and that makes me sad.

2900
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:28,620
Eh.

2901
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:29,620
Dark Sakura?

2902
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:34,740
He who controls the spice controls the universe.

2903
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:38,020
Alright that does it everybody, thank you again for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

2904
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:39,780
What say we do it all again next week?

2905
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:40,780
Sound good?

2906
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:43,020
Alright, have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week.

2907
