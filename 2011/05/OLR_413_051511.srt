00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:25,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, May 15, 2011, PlayStation Network returns after a three-week hiatus, a new entry in a popular fighting franchise is announced, and a classic Sega Genesis video game is localized for a new release.

2
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:36,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:42,298
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.

5
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:45,300
[SPEAKER_02]: First up, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:45,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

7
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,441
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

8
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:48,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I am accomplished.

9
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:49,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You're accomplished.

10
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:49,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

11
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:52,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I beat Portal 2 just now.

12
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

13
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:55,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in like right as the ending was going on.

14
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:59,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to spoil what happens, but I was like, oh, it's this part.

15
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:00,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this part, so...

16
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the all of that part.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured you would.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:07,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

20
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:09,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what is this you're eating tonight?

21
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:10,782
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks burnt.

22
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:16,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they don't understand what well done means versus, you know, torch.

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Your pizza looks burnt or dead.

24
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:19,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly well done.

25
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:20,105
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

26
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this quadruple bacon pizza again?

27
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:22,605
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's still triple bacon.

28
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple bacon.

29
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:23,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad.

30
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,867
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare I increase the bacon?

31
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we're going to get into the show, of course.

32
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,757
[SPEAKER_02]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

33
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to hear the show.

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,444
[SPEAKER_02]: All you do is you go to allgames.com, and as long as you have Flash installed, it comes right up.

35
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very easy.

36
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:51,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about any of those complicated, getting it into your Winamp or iTunes or whatever.

37
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:52,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easy.

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob said it, we're easy.

39
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,534
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to put it in WinF and iTunes, you can do that too.

40
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more information at allgames.com.

41
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

42
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to know.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,981
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use the normal All Games chat room.

44
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:06,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

45
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:06,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

46
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:07,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way we've done it.

47
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had our own chat room for like nine years.

48
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're Bethel.

49
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:12,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we like being in charge of our own chat room.

50
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:13,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a power thing.

51
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so chat.orangeslamstrator.com is where you can join us to chat with us live and give us your comments on what's going on.

52
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:24,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as Breakman in our chat room tonight who says there is no such thing as too much bacon.

53
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:29,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I think, remember when we had the bacon party for one of your birthdays?

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like all these bacon dishes here in house, that was too much bacon, I'm sorry.

55
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:37,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, actually, the smell is turning my stomach.

56
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:41,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

57
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,340
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

58
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just beat Portal 2 and I played some well.

59
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:19,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And because certain people in our guild are going to be helping me run through a dungeon and learn how to tank on Rebecca Black.

60
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I still love the character and I still love people's reactions

61
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I played WoW WoW and more WoW.

62
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:52,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting pissed off though because every time I try to play on Drenden I realize everybody's poor and nobody can give me the 300 gold I need to get flying.

63
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,005
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to earn it.

64
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Do herbalism and mining.

65
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I did it.

66
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,548
[SPEAKER_02]: You just go collect things for a while and then sell.

67
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:00,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you do it.

68
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I just need to get rid of tailoring.

69
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:06,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I don't want to fill up too much of WoW chat because there's a whole other show for that now.

70
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:08,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

71
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:11,276
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

72
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:11,336
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

73
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,666
[SPEAKER_02]: See any good movies lately?

74
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a Tron thing behind you and that made me think like, oh, Tron's on Blu-ray.

75
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm supposed to go see Thor on Tuesday.

76
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:19,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

77
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:20,189
[SPEAKER_07]: With Becky.

78
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay till after the credits.

79
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:22,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

80
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everybody says.

81
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

82
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,690
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

83
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,371
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only one character in that whole movie I care about seeing and he's only in one part.

84
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's my dude.

85
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,033
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

86
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:33,893
[SPEAKER_02]: But no spoilers.

87
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:36,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

88
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:36,895
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been playing?

89
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really two things.

90
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Portal 2 and Grand Theft Auto.

91
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: In Portal 2, I have Chapter 8 and Grand Theft Auto.

92
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:52,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just Grand Theft Auto.

93
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided to start playing some grenade launcher only games, which is kind of fun.

94
00:04:56,128 --> 00:05:00,711
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's pretty much about it.

95
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:02,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal 2 Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat

96
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got my ass handed to me because I guess I'm just not good at fighters.

97
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:30,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

98
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I need more practice.

99
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:32,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was trying.

100
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: First match was a little laggy.

101
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little bit disappointed at how kind of laggy.

102
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:40,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of those things where the frames per second suffer.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's how Mortal Kombat kind of compensates for the lag is that your frames suffer.

104
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I played another match today and it was fine.

105
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very smooth and worked fine.

106
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it really is just about who you're connecting to.

107
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,369
[SPEAKER_02]: The service is a little bit wonky still.

108
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:23,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to log in today and I got the PlayStation is down for maintenance message so I did it like four times and it finally let me in so kind of weird how that's working but whatever otherwise as far as new games go there is one new game I've been playing this week and that is a downloadable game on Xbox Live I believe it's on PlayStation Network as well but you know haven't really been able to tell for the past three weeks so it's on Xbox Live Arcade it's called Might and Magic Clash of Heroes I think is what it's called it's a that's old school

109
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's interesting because it's a DS game.

110
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:32,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a DS game a few years ago, but I have kind of lost touch of the Nintendo DS scene about four years ago.

111
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:36,951
[SPEAKER_02]: There just hasn't really been a lot on the DS I really wanted to play that wasn't like a first-party game.

112
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:40,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently this one was pretty good, and I totally missed it.

113
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:46,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's out now on Xbox Live and apparently PlayStation Network, not that you'll be able to download that anytime soon.

114
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a port of the DS version.

115
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:52,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I understand, they've done some redone graphics and things like that.

116
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:53,646
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me tell you a little bit about the game.

117
00:06:54,146 --> 00:07:00,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much a puzzle quest, gyromancer, RPPG game.

118
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Role playing puzzle game.

119
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:02,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another one of these.

120
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:08,736
[SPEAKER_02]: The battle system, if you watch somebody else play it, you're not going to understand what the hell is going on.

121
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has a really good ramp up in the single player mode to kind of get you used to things.

122
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:16,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way I could explain it, it's kind of like Magical Drop.

123
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

124
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:38,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

125
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:06,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, if you're into the Puzzle Quest 2 type of games where every battle is a full Bejeweled match, basically, this game is really right up that alley.

126
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:14,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, I actually found the game itself, the puzzle interface, to be kind of a neat little thinker.

127
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something a lot different from the Bejeweled-esque games, which pretty much a lot of the other games that are out there in the RPPG series kind of fall into right now.

128
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the lone exception is that...

129
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Chronicles Puzzle Quest

130
00:08:54,199 --> 00:09:18,625
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh yeah if you're into the puzzle games I really encourage you to check this one out because I think it would be worthy to your collection um not just a single player mode you can do Xbox Live matches I have not delved so far into that section yet so I can't say a lot but I can imagine that is definitely something that the DS version probably didn't have maybe it had it locally I don't know I could be totally misstating maybe someone shall correct me I don't know if it had internet play like I know DS has internet play

131
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live, Might Magic, Clash of Heroes

132
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But DarkSakura and I are going to LA.

133
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:50,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story.

134
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may or may not be back that Sunday.

135
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to try and make it back in time for the show, which would be good.

136
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,192
[SPEAKER_07]: No promises, though.

137
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,052
[SPEAKER_02]: No promises, though.

138
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:58,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

139
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll let you know a little closer.

140
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to stop by the cheese factory on the way back.

141
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still, what, about three weeks away?

142
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we got a little time to figure that all out.

143
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, join us on Facebook.

144

00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:41,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com CD Thunder in our chatroom says RPPG means Rob playing a video game, rated PG Rob playing PG I guess my Magic Clash of Heroes would be PG I mean there's cartoony sword fights, but no blood or anything like that Me playing Mortal Kombat would definitely not be rated PG Because I giggle all the time at the fatalities

148
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:44,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to see the, uh, what is it called?

149
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:46,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that called the Deadpool?

150
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:51,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know that's also one of DarkSakura's favorite comic pairs, but I think that's what it's called, the acid room?

151
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I saw the stage fatality for that for the first time.

152
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gross, but I giggled.

153
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:57,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.

154
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get my mom back over and show her that one.

155
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,520
[SPEAKER_07]: You're supposed to bring the game over.

156
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad, I forgot.

157
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:05,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky and Dark Sakura are going to Hollywood.

158
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet they are going to be in a movie.

159
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you hiding from us?

160
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:22,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe not.

161
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says... A YouTube movie, maybe.

162
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:31,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and an all-new team-up special, Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles.

163
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:35,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't want to leave Loki out of all the fun stuff, but, you know, he has the baby.

164
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:36,874
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't stop here.

165
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:38,156
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Activision country.

166
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:40,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

167
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming news, start us off, Loki.

168
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was like a firmware update today for the PlayStation Network, yay.

169
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,783
[SPEAKER_03]: 3.61, it's basically the update that makes you change your PlayStation Network ID.

170
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It was yesterday, but nobody knew.

171
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, yesterday, who cares, it all blends together, you know, I don't really give a shit.

172
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:02,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see, and I will say, okay.

173
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,850
[SPEAKER_03]: According to this post, this post was made on the 14th.

174
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be, oh, that would be yesterday.

175
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know my days, okay?

176
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So what can I say?

177
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:13,975
[SPEAKER_02]: They all just blend together.

178
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:15,476
[SPEAKER_03]: They all blend together, seriously.

179
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:16,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What day is today?

180
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:16,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

181
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:19,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so yeah, firmware update.

182
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, that, of course, led to the PlayStation Network starting to come up.

183
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:35,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love this little, very official Kaz Harai video where he's, like, making a State of a Union address or something like that.

184
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:35,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch?

185
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:38,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the blandest fucking message I've ever seen.

186
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:39,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how bad?

187
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I hate kicking these guys when they're down, but I was watching it.

188
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I was falling asleep.

189
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,410
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why people are drawn to Reggie Fils-Aimé from Nintendo, because you feel his enthusiasm.

190
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:55,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when he's hawking such bullshit, like the Vitality Sensor or whatever, you at least really feel his enthusiasm.

191
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why he's very popular with gamers.

192
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:01,533
[SPEAKER_02]: But Kaz Hirai is very, just like, so vanilla.

193
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my name is Kaz Hirai.

194
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to party.

195
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,365
[SPEAKER_03]: We here at Sony embrace fun.

196
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:11,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurrah.

197
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know my friends over here are now enjoying the fun PlayStation Network.

198
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:20,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody happy.

199
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:22,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Party time.

200
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:25,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun, fun, fun, fun.

201
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday was Thursday.

202
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow is Saturday.

203
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I actually want to play a little bit of this.

204
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch this, DarkSakura?

205
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:34,853
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

206
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:37,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me if this does not scream, I am a party animal.

207
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:50,830
[SPEAKER_01]: What is he doing with his hands?

208
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,352
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes these very, very distinct, like, this is the part where I'm going to clasp my hands.

209
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,953
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because the teleprompter tells him to.

210
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:56,293
[SPEAKER_01]: You think?

211
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:56,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Clasp hands.

212
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:58,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And now for the secret ingredient.

213
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:20,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the money that we have lost, we're going to actually be raising a few of our rates in the next few months to pay for this new teleprompter.

214
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:29,811
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to keep it on a separate network because PSN is actually still down and we're just put psychedelics into your breakfast cereal so that you'll believe it's back up.

215
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:37,404
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, we had to work around the clock, because some dumbass put a giant clock in her server room, and we had to work around that damn thing because we couldn't move it out of the way.

216
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:42,406
[SPEAKER_07]: By we had to work around the clock, I mean everybody except me, where I went home and ate crayons.

217
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:49,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I especially like the green one, because when I cough it up later on, it looks like mucus, and I can gross out my kids.

218
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it just reminded me of one of those...

219
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:00,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cheesy acting or something.

220
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

221
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:04,539
[SPEAKER_07]: He's reading off a teleprompter.

222
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you look where his eyes are fixated the entire time, he's reading a teleprompter.

223
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Or he's staring into your soul.

224
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:14,068
[SPEAKER_07]: He can't.

225
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:14,929
[SPEAKER_07]: He has no soul.

226
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:18,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Only people with souls can stare at other people with souls.

227
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the unwritten book of souls.

228
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:31,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, yeah, the PlayStation Network, the first phase, I guess leading up to the full return by the end of May, included the following services.

229
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:36,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the ability to sign into the PlayStation Network and Curiosity, including resetting the passwords.

230
00:15:37,707 --> 00:16:03,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Restoration of online gameplay including PlayStation 3 and PSP Playback of rental video content Music and limited services from Curiosity Access to third party services such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and MLB TV The Friends category and PlayStation Home Yes, thank god PlayStation Home was part of that I missed it so much

231
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's so much partying going on in PlayStation Home.

232
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:17,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, it's fully back up throughout North America, which is awesome for us.

233
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:25,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just running home right now to go sign up on the PlayStation Network to change my password and play some games.

234
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, I'm not, because I don't care.

235
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:40,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, Sony Online Entertainment announced that they're going to be offering their members a free month, which is great since it's been down for a month, and they're rewarding their players for the affected downtime.

236
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:46,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess some double XP events for EverQuest and Vanguard, and they're going to be doing...

237
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:53,554
[SPEAKER_03]: and some special gear in DC Universe and Star Wars Galaxies.

238
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:59,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see, well the DC Universe one, it's like some stupid cowl thing that looks like you could be Batman or something.

239
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:05,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Star Wars Galaxies, I'm surprised, I didn't even realize that was still up.

240
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, learn something.

241
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:17,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, I guess Lifetime subscribers will get another load in, or I guess some more in-game currency.

242
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,578
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 station cash.

243
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever station cash is.

244
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:26,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, what?

245
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:28,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you're right.

246
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,234
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain shut off for that whole thing right there.

247
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what I have to say.

248
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:37,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody's relieved to be back online and playing.

249
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anyone still mad?

250
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have a feeling by next week no one's going to be mad anymore.

251
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,920
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to be forgetting about it.

252
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:46,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

253
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:56,626
[SPEAKER_02]: With E3 so close and around the corner too, this is still going to be fresh in people's minds when E3 rolls around.

254
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the disadvantages that Sony's going into this with.

255
00:17:59,448 --> 00:17:59,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

256
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:23,056
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can say that the Red Ring of Death thing was a big debacle too but you know remember Microsoft kind of finally it took them long enough but they kind of you know came out and admitted fault for that and they were generally able to get over that whole thing whereas I don't know this is still really fresh in people's minds we're still going to have lawsuits after this that have yet to be settled and so on this is not over today I mean

257
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Network is still not 100% back up.

258
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,839
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't buy games online right now.

259
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:30,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a developer, that kind of sucks.

260
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:31,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

261
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:31,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

262
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:36,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you read one of the stories.

263
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:44,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's some ridiculous stories regarding this whole thing, but I mean, I don't know.

264
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:56,074
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it doesn't really matter because I'm never on PlayStation Network, so it just was an inconvenience because now I had to wait to activate my Steam copy of Portal 2.

265
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, technically I didn't have to wait, but...

266
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a non-event for me.

267
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, eh, whatever.

268
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not on it.

269
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be on it.

270
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

271
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, this is late breaking.

272
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:18,634
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another video that was just released by Sony of Kaz Hirai giving an update as to what's going on on PlayStation Network.

273
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:22,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look and see what's going on in this latest announcement from Kaz Hirai.

274
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:28,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Bueller Bueller Bueller

275
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:30,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Bueller?

276
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:33,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Bueller?

277
00:19:50,346 --> 00:20:18,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Publishers and developers obviously have been out quite a bit of money That's three weeks of lost sales and then some Again, the story is not back up just yet Apparently, Sony was not telling the developers and publishers really anything They only had the same information that the rest of us had Sony finally sent out a letter to its publishing partners It was sent out three weeks after the PlayStation Network went down Which is interesting Here's a clip of the letter

278
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:25,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear partner, as you know, certain PlayStation Network curiosity is, which by the way is how you pronounce it, not core-y-ro-city.

279
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Curiosity.

280
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:28,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Q, curiosity.

281
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:29,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Curiosity.

282
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:33,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't care.

283
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I don't care.

284
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:39,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, you're so clever for putting a Q there and making me try to figure out how to pronounce a fucking thing.

285
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,775
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

286
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:23,585
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they go over exactly what happened which really is all the stuff that you would have got just reading the internet and the various game blogs and what's going on let's see as a valued partner we aim to keep the lines of communication open so that you are aware of our progress

287
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:31,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Our focus has been to confirm the security of the networks, protect customer data, and get the services back online as quickly as possible.

288
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:36,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We will do our best to respond to all of your inquiries, and we will do everything we can to possibly support you.

289
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:40,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is a load of crap, if I've ever heard it.

290
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,902
[SPEAKER_02]: We aim to keep the lines of communication open.

291
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:44,503
[SPEAKER_02]: From now on.

292
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:48,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Regurgitating what every news outlet has been saying for the past three weeks.

293
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:49,988
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

294
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:55,013
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a PlayStation Network developer, I would be so mad about this.

295
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Why weren't you up front with us sooner?

296
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:03,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really going to give me pause in developing a PlayStation Network exclusive.

297
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:11,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is really going to have to, as their game plan to get up and going again, they're really going to have to shell out money for exclusive agreements.

298
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.

299
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:20,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, some other stuff with the whole PlayStation breach.

300
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:29,708
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rumor going around that a rented Amazon server was actually used to launch the attack, which is interesting because Amazon was having all their issues.

301
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,670
[SPEAKER_02]: The web service, not the...

302
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the same portion of Amazon that sells the books and CDs.

303
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:40,754
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to remember, Amazon is a very large service, and they also sell web hosting as part of their service.

304
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:48,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might remember that a bunch of sites they hosted went down, which was a big deal for Amazon because they have service-level agreements that were being broken and so forth.

305
00:22:49,039 --> 00:23:00,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to Bloomberg News, they are saying that the hackers who actually hacked PlayStation Network rented a server from Amazon.com to do so, signing up for the service using fake information.

306
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:00,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

307
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:10,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting theory, but pardon my ignorance, but how would this server be used to hack PlayStation Network?

308
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:14,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a DDoS is one thing, but that's not what we're talking about happening here.

309
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a simple DDoS.

310
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:19,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody got in there, and the information got exposed.

311
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:24,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does that work using the cloud computer?

312
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:25,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just don't know enough about hacking.

313
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:27,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, any ideas?

314
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:27,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

315
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:32,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if they're brute forcing something, the more computers they have working on it, the faster it goes.

316
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:43,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it can be guaranteed that if this is true, you can see a subpoena will be going out to Amazon very soon to try and figure out whose credit card was used to sign up.

317
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:47,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, if that ends up being true, that was kind of dumb of the hackers to do.

318
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But they probably used a fake or stolen credit card.

319
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:51,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure.

320
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:56,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put fake names, but the credit card, we'll put a real credit card.

321
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:14,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a real credit card name or something like that Also, one other quick thing about this whole thing Retailers are saying that PlayStation 3 owners are just ditching the platform altogether and migrating to the 360

322
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:16,108
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would be ironic?

323
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, just real quick.

324
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:31,072
[SPEAKER_03]: You know one of the stories that came out before they were saying that there was people that were hacking the PlayStation 3 using the... It's a new custom firmware called Rebug or something like that.

325
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:38,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it gave them access to the developer side of things where you can buy PlayStation content using this...

326
00:24:39,574 --> 00:24:40,215
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

327
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:02,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently a lot of people were canceling their pre-orders for Brink for the PlayStation 3.

328
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff going on in the used market, which I think DarkSakura is going to get into in a minute here.

329
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:13,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, lots of PlayStation 3s being traded in, people going to Xbox 360.

330
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:15,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is just from a source in Belgium.

331
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sure...

332
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:26,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's an increase over normal, but I'm not sure if it's a, oh shit, PlayStation is damned situation yet.

333
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:35,498
[SPEAKER_03]: People, I mean, if you're that fickle that you're going to just dump your system because the network's down for a couple weeks, then whatever.

334
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:36,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That's most people.

335
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:43,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to be fickle enough to buy the system again later on when there's something that you want to play on it, because that's what's going to end up happening.

336
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

337
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Live goes down every once in a while for a day and stuff.

338
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't see people running out in mass selling their consoles.

339
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:55,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, it doesn't go down because somebody stole my credit card information.

340
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:56,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never been down for 22 days.

341
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:56,745
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

342
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there is a big difference to that.

343
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:10,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think, you know, I do think selling your PlayStation on this alone might be a little bit throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

344
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,739
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

345
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:17,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there could be that exclusive that comes out that makes you kind of want to come back, sorta.

346
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you sell this and you mean it, then...

347
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:24,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everybody has that right to make those types of choices.

348
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:31,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know too many people that sell systems only to buy them back when the game they really want comes out.

349
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:33,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the 3DS.

350
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're selling a 3DS back already, you really should question why you bought one in the first place.

351
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really the underlying problem right now.

352
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:46,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody knows the 3DS lineup right now is weak at best.

353
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:55,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, there's going to be much better 3DS games by the end of the year between the Kid Icarus, the assumed Mario game that's going to be announced at E3, and so forth.

354
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be more reasons to have it.

355
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:59,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So why sell back a 3DS now just to buy one six months later?

356
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:06,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are people, I mean, and there are going to be a certain percentage of people that just feel so violated by this whole thing.

357
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:07,348
[SPEAKER_02]: They've sworn off Sony.

358
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:11,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could damage the PlayStation 4 later on.

359
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know, I think it's a bit too early to really see the full ramifications.

360
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:21,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is so important more than ever this year to really see what Sony's bringing out the big guns this year at E3.

361
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:22,635
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know...

362
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly loving the fact that Sony's PlayStation Network was down for 22 days that my credit card information was stolen.

363
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same token, I kind of go... And they keep going back and forth on that crap, too.

364
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:39,284
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, well, we have no evidence that it actually was stolen.

365
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, but you still want to be sure and take all these safety precautions.

366
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:47,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but we have really no evidence that it's been stolen.

367
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:49,030
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going back and forth on it.

368
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like saying, listen, it's been compromised.

369
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:53,692
[SPEAKER_03]: and be done with it.

370
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:58,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say, well, you know, there's really no evidence that they looked at it.

371
00:27:58,494 --> 00:27:59,574
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have the data.

372
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:00,394
[SPEAKER_03]: They stole all of it.

373
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:00,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

374
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:04,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They maybe just deleted the file and said, pat themselves on the back and said, good job me.

375
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I hacked Sony.

376
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:17,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just, it's going to be interesting because later on this year, you still have some big, you know, The Last Guardian is a game that a lot of people are foaming at the mouth over.

377
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very, it's going to be like, you know,

378
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:23,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Will people forgive us if the games are good enough?

379
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:27,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very, very interesting these next few months.

380
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyhow, let's move on.

381
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I think DarkSakura has a little more to add to this whole retail angle.

382
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:50,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, there is a notice that, at least in the U.S., that 10 of the most popular online titles that were for PlayStation 3 dropped by an average of 7.4%, basically since the 20th of April.

383
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:56,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the same 10 titles saw a 0.7% increase on Xbox 360 for sales.

384
00:28:58,312 --> 00:29:09,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, one of the UK retailers was reporting that they had double the amount of PS3s being brought in and then half of those people picking up an Xbox 360.

385
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:17,678
[SPEAKER_07]: That also sales of used titles have just completely been borked by PS3.

386
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:19,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So like two coming in at four?

387
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:22,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

388
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all fuzzy map it sounds like.

389
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at any rate, most people really are that fickle.

390
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:41,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really people in general, I think, are just so fickle that they're going to not put up with any type of inconvenience.

391
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:45,571
[SPEAKER_07]: When high real life doesn't always work out for you, you're going to have to wait.

392
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:47,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't care.

393
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:51,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chat room at chat.orange.com for some feedback going on right now.

394
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:59,196
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru in our chat room says Red Ring of Death and PlayStation Network being hacked are only comparable in terms of showing the deficiencies that Microsoft and Sony has.

395
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting.

396
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:05,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because Microsoft was always a software company then they were getting into hardware.

397
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:10,864
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in Microsoft, though, I think that their response was a little bit better than Sony's.

398
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:16,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least, granted, I don't think they ever really admitted how many are affected.

399
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:19,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, it's more than the 1% that they were quoting.

400
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every single one.

401
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:21,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one.

402
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one launched.

403
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:22,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

404
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:27,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one will be affected.

405
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:34,650
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have one that's from the launch, you know, 2005 or whatever, and it's still working today, that's a fluke.

406
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, I know every single one will die.

407
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop responding to something you just said a little bit ago.

408
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:50,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Loki is under-recognizing the huge dude-bro contingent who only play Black Ops, Battlefield, Modern Warfare all day and that's all they play.

409
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:53,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're Sony geeks and never got into Halo.

410
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:56,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I would add to that, the Blu-ray player was enticing.

411
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:57,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

412
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:06,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it or not, the Blu-ray factor being in the PlayStation 3 is still selling a lot of those over Xbox 360s to the dude bro contingent that Salacious Pop brings up.

413
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the audience that would be listening to this show, but the people that are like, oh, this thing plays Blu-rays and it plays Modern Warfare?

414
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

415
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:38,941
[SPEAKER_07]: well first of all your blu-ray player will still work and it's back up so what's the problem all of those people now that it took my credit card info so if you gave them your credit card info well on top of that just call the bank and change your shit you know a little inconvenience for your own security sorry you're gonna have to deal with it suck it up

416
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:40,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't give a shit.

417
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if somebody tries to use my number, guess what?

418
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,980
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call and cancel the card.

419
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll trace it back to whoever did it.

420
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:44,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't care.

421
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Really don't care.

422
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:09,326
[SPEAKER_02]: If that happens, you're going to care when it happens if it happens at a bad time.

423
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not going to affect my credit.

424
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,910
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to affect my finances.

425
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:18,134
[SPEAKER_07]: The funds will be frozen and I'll get a new card.

426
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:20,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully they'll catch whoever did it.

427
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:22,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, don't give a shit.

428
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:24,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I said this a couple weeks before on the show.

429
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody were to use this credit card information that's been stolen, you're really an idiot.

430
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:33,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just asking to get caught for this whole thing.

431
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:36,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the FBI is on this now.

432
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:41,038
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just waiting for someone to fuck this up and give away how this all kind of happened.

433
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:45,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the amount of information they actually got.

434
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take them forever to parse through that stuff anyways.

435
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:56,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there is the risk that your identity might be stolen or something like that.

436
00:32:57,485 --> 00:33:01,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's very unlikely even still.

437
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:06,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'll catch them before they even come close to parsing through all the data that's on there.

438
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with this comment in our chatroom.

439
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:15,531
[SPEAKER_02]: DefectiveCandy at chat.ornersoundtrade.com says, If someone tries to use my credit card, guess what?

440
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:16,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks to be them.

441
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:17,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm broke.

442
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:17,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.

443
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just thinking that, you know.

444
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:24,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I really... I really...

445
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:30,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, wasting time freaking out over this is really exactly just that, wasting time.

446
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:34,507
[SPEAKER_07]: All you're doing is working yourself up.

447
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:41,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Selling your PlayStation 3 is going to mean you're not going to be able to play whatever that is that's going to come out later.

448
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:45,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're going to have to spend more money to get another one if you want to play it badly enough.

449
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:50,275
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the end, lacking patience just makes you a loser.

450
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:51,536
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

451
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:58,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but at the same time, I can understand where somebody is going to sell their PlayStation 3 back over this.

452
00:33:58,145 --> 00:33:58,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

453
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:07,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just would say think ahead because you don't want to do something reactive only to get sweetened back by Sony later on.

454
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We also still don't know what they plan to do to kind of right the wrong and what they're going to give as part of this, I guess you could say, severance package or whatever to kind of come back to the PlayStation 4.

455
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

456
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,381
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know?

457
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I...

458
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,492
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was thinking of selling my PlayStation 3 back, I'd kind of be waiting until after E3 to make sure I really want to do it.

459
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:51,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not selling my fucking PS3 back because it's a fully backwards compatible PS3 with a 500 gig hard drive in it that I don't play on the PlayStation Network and hardly ever buy games for.

460
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:54,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm content with it.

461
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it for Blu-rays.

462
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:57,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

463
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:57,716
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

464
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:01,779
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a Sony game that really is awesome that I have to have, I can get it.

465
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:06,503
[SPEAKER_03]: But for everything else that's multi-platform, you better believe it, I'm getting it on the Xbox 360.

466
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:08,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's just what I play more.

467
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,286
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more convenient for me.

468
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3's hooked up to the front TV.

469
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelly wants to play Animal Crossing still.

470
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:23,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's been PlayStation Network all the time for the past three weeks.

471
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:27,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, there is news in other parts of the gaming world and I think it's time we took a trip there.

472
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,251
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Xbox?

473
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about something going on in the 360 world, Loki.

474
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:31,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

475
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

476
00:36:06,975 --> 00:36:13,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So along with that, there's also going to be some other updates including PayPal.

477
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming on May 19th, which is interesting.

478
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:24,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to use your PayPal account to add funds for buying Xbox Live Marketplace materials and whatnot.

479
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:30,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely interesting in light of everything that's going on at Sony that you can kind of use a middleman now.

480
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:31,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

481
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:31,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

482
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:32,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

483
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:32,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

484
00:36:52,208 --> 00:37:04,940
[SPEAKER_03]: you know use the connect to move your avatar around kind of like a talk show almost this sounds kind of weird to me because don't they have a video chat program as it is right now they do but you can't wave around as your avatar

485
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:06,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And ugly pedophiles.

486
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:06,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

487
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:28,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, as I mentioned, the XGD3.

488
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,537
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new format that's going to be for the discs.

489
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:35,158
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is, of course, they're going to be adding some more copy protection.

490
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:39,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also going to be flashing all of those people that have flashed modded drives.

491
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be flashing those drives back to their stock firmwares and going to be fixing it in a way where you can't change it.

492
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:50,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't easily change it.

493
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:51,964
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that a little bit later.

494
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:52,725
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

495
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:54,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

496
00:37:55,087 --> 00:38:03,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that also saves me a step because I have one flash system still that we... It was left over from... I just didn't want to bother to flash it back.

497
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:04,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I don't have to.

498
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:05,567
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do it for me.

499
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:06,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

500
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,908
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about this news of what's coming out in the Xbox Spring Update?

501
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, usually these updates are pretty exciting.

502
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,372
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least one little tidbit in there where you're like, oh, that's going to be awesome to have.

503
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, I don't know, like the USB storage or whatever.

504
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:23,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But this time around, I'm looking at the updates going, eh, none of this.

505
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, PayPal, okay.

506
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:27,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who would use that, but not me.

507
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd use it.

508
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

509
00:38:31,121 --> 00:38:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was buying a lot of content on Xbox Live, I'd use it because I sell a lot of shit on eBay.

510
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:42,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, when I'm not dumping my funds back into my bank account, I usually have quite a bit sitting in my PayPal account.

511
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:43,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can get that.

512
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,310
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I don't really use PayPal like that.

513
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I use PayPal to pay for Skype, and that's about it.

514
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:55,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been using Skype ever since they were a company based in the UK, and it was actually very easy to do the international funds through PayPal.

515
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:23,237
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's why I have a PayPal account I don't use it for anything else I use it a lot for just buying stuff online I buy a lot of stuff on eBay I buy a lot of stuff like subscriptions for things I'll pay for that that makes sense though for those people that actually use PayPal as a wallet from like eBay and things like that that is kind of a neat way to be able to buy the games I use mine for eBay and Dan uses it for his RC cars alright I get it I guess that is a little bit more exciting but I don't know

516
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:25,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about me again.

517
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:26,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not excited.

518
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing in it for me.

519
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,883
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I don't buy a lot of download content anymore for games other than maybe like a Grand Theft Auto or something like that.

520
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:39,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably wouldn't buy download content for a lot of things.

521
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:42,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I may or may not have bought Dance Central songs the other day.

522
00:39:44,168 --> 00:40:03,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just, you know, I have certain hardware configurations in various places that facilitate the ability to not have to purchase that stuff and yet enjoy the full range of content.

523
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the play's way I can say that.

524
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I really don't buy a lot.

525
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly because look at what I'm playing each week.

526
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto.

527
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:19,134
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not any new content coming out for that, so there's nothing for me to buy.

528
00:40:19,154 --> 00:40:22,216
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Hero, anything they put out, I'll buy.

529
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way it is.

530
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:37,171
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me move on to a story about something that maybe you'll be using your PayPal money to download.

531
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:37,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

532
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:47,155
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been an ESRB rating that's come out for the Genesis game Monster World 4 coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

533
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:49,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that kind of spilled the news a little early.

534
00:40:49,816 --> 00:41:07,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega of Europe actually confirmed that they are bringing the game over to PlayStation Network and Wii Virtual Console so odd that they left Xbox Live Arcade out of that but whatever maybe something's happening in the future I don't know there's going to be a vintage collection that actually comes out later in

535
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:14,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've been milking those Genesis games for all they're worth, and there's still people that'll pay five bucks a game for it, so whatever.

536
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:22,312
[SPEAKER_02]: This collection's gonna have Wonder Boy and Monster Land, Revenge of Shinobi, Alex Kidd and Miracle World, Wonder Boy and Monster World.

537
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, all those games have already come out on the virtual console here in North America.

538
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:35,396
[SPEAKER_02]: But the interesting thing about this, Monster World 4, it was never actually officially released on a console outside of Japan,

539
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:39,521
[SPEAKER_02]: and get this, it's going to be localized as a part of this collection.

540
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:46,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sega is actually localizing this ages old, what is this, 94, I think, game?

541
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:48,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say that, Rob.

542
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

543
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:51,458
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I graduated.

544
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't write the news, I just report it.

545
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: As trolls would say on the internet, Sega does when Nintendo don't.

546
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, localizing an old game that maybe fans might want to play just because they can.

547
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:05,396
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best zing I've heard on the show.

548
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:05,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say that.

549
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:07,778
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

550
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:08,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Cho Aniki came out.

551
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not a Nintendo game.

552
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it wasn't Nintendo.

553
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:16,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when Sin and Punishment, the original, came out, they didn't bother to translate it.

554
00:42:16,144 --> 00:42:21,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of those games didn't need translation, but this is really the first time that they've gone back and actually are going to translate a game.

555
00:42:21,928 --> 00:42:28,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I can't imagine Monster World 4 has the epic dialogue of a role-playing game, but it's probably got what?

556
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:30,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a Mario-y style game, right?

557
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:32,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of a side-scrolling adventure game, right?

558
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:35,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably got a decent amount of dialogue.

559
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:37,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat that they're localizing it.

560
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:43,667
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if I have to buy this whole big collection with all these other Genesis games just to get it, I don't know.

561
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:45,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta be honest.

562
00:42:46,178 --> 00:43:14,507
[SPEAKER_02]: well I don't know I hear Monster World 4 is really really good and I'm missing a lot by not playing it but my desire to go and pay money for this old 94 game I don't know I'm not like super excited about it I think there's other stuff in the gaming world my money would be spent on but I guess I'll wait and see when this comes out maybe everybody will be like you have to play it it's great and we were missing so much before a good game is still a good game at the end of the day right so alright moving on DarkSakura what do you got for us

563
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:18,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I have other news related to Disney.

564
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:24,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm first going to point out something that I totally loathe that this article does.

565
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:30,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the article says, Disney Studio costs up $3 million for violating kiddie gamers' privacy.

566
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But Disney didn't do it.

567
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:40,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It was titles that had been acquired before Disney acquired Playdom, which is their online kids gaming thing.

568
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:48,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So to say Disney did it, yeah, Disney may have accepted all the liability, but it wasn't Disney that did it, and I hate when titles are misleading like that, so...

569
00:43:49,688 --> 00:44:11,945
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, Playdom, which is the Disney Social Game Studios, paid $3 million as a settlement for titles that were there before Playdom acquired, I'm sorry, that were acquired by Playdom before Disney acquired it, were collecting kids' ages and email addresses without parental consent.

570
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,086
[SPEAKER_07]: It was posted without parental consent.

571
00:44:14,727 --> 00:44:16,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So Disney coughed up the cash for it.

572
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Curse of Acclaim

573
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:48,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then Playdom bought out Acclaim.

574
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:55,392
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually the former Acclaim CEO, Howard Marks, is also being named in the case.

575
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:56,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

576
00:44:57,073 --> 00:45:05,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I would say, you know, whoever holds whatever rights are left, you know, Disney needs to go after them.

577
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:11,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really tricky, especially when you're talking about games marketed towards kids.

578
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:17,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what game comes to mind for me is that Smurfs Village game on iOS has taken a lot of heat.

579
00:45:17,557 --> 00:45:19,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a Capcom game, if I'm not mistaken.

580
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:25,802
[SPEAKER_02]: The Smurfs Village game, because of how easy it is for kids to get sucked into that game and buy the little Smurf berries.

581
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just touch, touch, touch to do it.

582
00:45:28,744 --> 00:45:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard these stories of kids spending hundreds of dollars on these dumbass Smurf berries to make things grow faster in the game.

583
00:45:38,271 --> 00:45:42,115
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 year olds who don't have a true concept of money don't understand that.

584
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:49,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And parents that don't have a concept of parenting don't understand that their kids are buying stuff through their phone.

585
00:45:53,334 --> 00:46:07,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's funny though because I think back to a time when I was probably like 14 or 15 and I was on Prodigy and Prodigy used to charge for using chat rooms and one month I ran up like a $90 bill in the chat room or something like that and my mother... Oh God, I never heard the end of it, you guys.

586
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Never heard the end of it.

587
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:12,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did the same thing in Prodigy but it wasn't necessarily because of the...

588
00:46:14,992 --> 00:46:20,677
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room, it was because the number that it picked to dial was long distance.

589
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:21,358
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

590
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:22,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

591
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:24,721
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good.

592
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:25,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Love dialing.

593
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:31,428
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I used to have the hookup on AOL back in the day because I dialed in on an 800 number.

594
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:33,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you had to pay for that.

595
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:34,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And had a free account.

596
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:36,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I thought you had to pay for the AOL.

597
00:46:36,971 --> 00:46:38,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a chatroom host for Cartoon Network.

598
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:50,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost impossible not to have a free account through AOL because you'd threaten to cancel or they'd just send you another 72-day trial or whatever.

599
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:54,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a ridiculous amount of... 720-hour trial, that's what it was.

600
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy, that's 30 days.

601
00:46:58,778 --> 00:46:59,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

602
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm referring to back when it was like $3 an hour or something Back when it had just gotten out of DOS Ranma in the chatroom says Sky, if she didn't beat you with the belt, you got off lucky, lol No, all the abuse in my household was always emotional, never physical

603
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,011
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not abuse.

604
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:23,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

605
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:31,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about release dates and what's coming out to a store near you, depending on where you live.

606
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:32,540
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with the US.

607
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:34,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much this week.

608
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:35,022
[SPEAKER_03]: L.A.

609
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:39,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 being the biggest title of the week.

610
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:40,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a big title, right?

611
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:41,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a little bit.

612
00:47:42,348 --> 00:47:45,411
[SPEAKER_03]: The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings on PC.

613
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:53,669
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out from Atari, The First Templar on Xbox 360, SpongeBob SquigglePants for the 3DS.

614
00:47:53,709 --> 00:48:00,133
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the game that's sort of like WarioWare, but here it's terrible, so, you know, keep that in mind.

615
00:48:00,413 --> 00:48:02,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Another terrible title for the 3DS.

616
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:03,915
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shock!

617
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:05,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, shocker.

618
00:48:05,536 --> 00:48:08,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Cake Mania Main Street for the Nintendo DS.

619
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:11,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's all like the other Cake Mania games.

620
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:13,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable 3 on PC this week.

621
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:15,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

622
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:40,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it Alright, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there You get your version of Portal 2 this week on the Xbox 360 And the PlayStation 3, those coming out on May the 19th And yeah, those are like localized versions for Japan I don't know if they have all new voice actors or if it uses subtitles or what But yeah, they're getting their own version of Portal 2 So they can get in on the fun that we're having over here

623
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: again that's on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 also coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week excuse me it's a price reduction not a new game but FIFA Soccer 11 moves into the best hit series from EA it's like it's a big price reduction in Japan this week moving on to the Nintendo Wii nothing this week what a surprise

624
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo 3DS Dead or Alive Dimensions finally gets its release this week in Japan.

625
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:07,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure we'll be hearing some reports on that game and how it turned out because we'll be getting it soon enough.

626
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:13,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the 3DS over there, Animal Resort, Dobutsu no Tsukuro comes out.

627
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:17,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars also comes out.

628
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:22,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to look at this Animal Resort and honestly when I see the box, the first thing I think of, honest, Africa.

629
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: because it looks just like that game.

630
00:49:26,078 --> 00:49:27,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's putting out Animal Resort?

631
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Resort is being put out by... Who is this?

632
00:49:31,662 --> 00:49:33,244
[SPEAKER_02]: AQ Interactive is putting out the game.

633
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:33,644
[SPEAKER_02]: But look at this.

634
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,767
[SPEAKER_02]: There's elephants you can take pictures of and hippopotamus.

635
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:44,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you feed them because there's little items there on the bottom and it looks like this guy is dragging a type of fruit to feed the hippopotamus.

636
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:45,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is adorable.

637
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:47,834
[SPEAKER_02]: There's apparently penguins in this.

638
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:49,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I kind of want it, to be honest.

639
00:49:49,496 --> 00:49:50,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty good.

640
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:53,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for a 3DS title, the graphics are pretty good.

641
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,062
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of an interesting twist on Nintendogs.

642
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet what this is is it's kind of like Nintenzu.

643
00:50:01,046 --> 00:50:03,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's like Anemon Snap.

644
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:13,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was just wondering if the only reason I asked who made it is because there's a title coming from Ubisoft called Zoo Mania that looks similar to that.

645
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if it's actually the exact same game.

646
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:16,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

647
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:17,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to look that up.

648
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,262
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Sony PSP this week on May the 19th, Akiba's Strip comes out.

649
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:26,644
[SPEAKER_02]: This is... That's what it sounds like.

650
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game where you get people to strip.

651
00:50:30,046 --> 00:50:31,187
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't get people to strip.

652
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:31,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.

653
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

654
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:33,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

655
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:35,790
[SPEAKER_03]: By fighting them, their clothes will be removed.

656
00:50:38,491 --> 00:50:41,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that is what's really happening in this picture.

657
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:44,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like she's wearing cat ears and no pants.

658
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:44,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

659
00:50:59,912 --> 00:51:02,474
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not have fully nude games on the PSP.

660
00:51:02,634 --> 00:51:03,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, I've looked.

661
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,716
[SPEAKER_07]: The wife really wants one.

662
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:08,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, they sell them on J-List.

663
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,880
[SPEAKER_03]: They're X-rated UMDs, that's what those are.

664
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't have actual PSP games.

665
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:19,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, this is Japan we're talking about.

666
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:22,986
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very conservative when it comes to video games.

667
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

668
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:25,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead or Alive Dimensions, and L.A.

669
00:51:25,913 --> 00:51:26,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire

670
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

671
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:23,436
[SPEAKER_03]: and Kinect, Windows Phone and an array of other Windows devices.

672
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:30,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, of course, they announced that they'll still be supporting the platforms that it's on already.

673
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:34,123
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP and whatnot.

674
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:44,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it says also Skype users with Link, Outlook and Xbox Live and other communities will be able to connect with Skype as well.

675
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

676
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

677
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:56,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering now if we're going to see Windows with Skype built in as a default program and stuff like that.

678
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's kind of neat that they're going to have...

679
00:53:01,703 --> 00:53:03,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they're going to do the Avatar Connect with Skype.

680
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

681
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly this is going to be coming to the 360 sooner rather than later.

682
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:13,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of surprised this isn't being rushed for the spring update because that's a pretty big addition.

683
00:53:13,176 --> 00:53:21,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that I guess right now the Connect to video chat will work with Windows Messenger, but I don't know anyone that uses Windows Messenger.

684
00:53:21,145 --> 00:53:21,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

685
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:50,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not also on an Xbox So I don't know But you know the interesting thing about this We've been using Skype here at Orange Lounge Radio Since before podcasting I think we took our first Skype call Probably in 03 However old Skype is We were on that really early We're pretty loyal to the program Until it steals our credit card information Or something We're not going to go anywhere Until it out parties Kaz Exactly

686
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:58,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interesting because pretty soon we're going to be able to invite phone calls from people on their connects to chat with the show.

687
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,681
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be something.

688
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:04,466
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty something, except the only problem is you still can't stream the show onto the 360.

689
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:07,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

690
00:54:07,526 --> 00:54:09,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was something they would do about that.

691
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:14,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Not unless you have... No, you can't do it through Pandora.

692
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:18,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Last.fm that's on there or Pandora?

693
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:18,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

694
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Last.fm's on there.

695
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:20,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Last.fm.

696
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:22,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can get it through there.

697
00:54:23,876 --> 00:54:26,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could hook it up to a PC, but what's the point?

698
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:31,301
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's hooked up to a PC already, then you might as well just use the PC.

699
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty, who is one of our archive experts in our chatroom, says she knows we were taking them at least by episode 111, which would have been 04.

700
00:54:40,734 --> 00:54:42,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure we were taking them before that.

701
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:45,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it was a while ago.

702
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:51,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, be very curious to see what this kind of all pans out to.

703
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are saying they paid too much for Skype.

704
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

705
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much Skype is worth.

706
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:00,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth nothing to me.

707
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:01,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying for it.

708
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:31,417
[SPEAKER_03]: uh yeah I mean Skype doesn't really do ads and they're free you know it's it's they're gonna have to add ads to it at some point I think and I don't know how people are gonna feel about that well they have to have some I mean they're they have you know the Skype out services and stuff like that that's kinda neat you know um and you know if they're pushing the whole family angle and stuff hey now you can call your friends on their phones and stuff like that or I don't know

709
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, the Level Up event was held by Namco Bandai this week, and we want to go over some news from that event, including, and this makes me very excited, a new Soul Calibur game was announced, and I love the Soul Calibur series.

710
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:46,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Soul Calibur V was announced this week.

711
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:47,305
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

712
00:55:47,325 --> 00:55:48,125
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be happening.

713
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,828
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little teaser trailer that was released.

714
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can play a little bit of it here in Z Studio.

715
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:59,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot of characters showed up in there, but I think Nightmare's in there.

716
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:06,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's a new character named Patroclus, who's supposed to be the son of Sophitia and Rothian.

717
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:08,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So, could be interesting.

718
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,183
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is going to be out in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

719
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:16,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It is set 17 years after the events of Soul Calibur 4.

720
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:20,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I guess there's going to be quite a bit of roster revision going on there.

721
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Siegfried is also supposed to be in the game, so could be interesting.

722
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:26,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Our kind should not exist in this world Not ever again

723
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So this trailer is more like the opening cutscene that you would see in the game, probably.

724
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:53,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really show a lot of gameplay.

725
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:55,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your very typical announcement trailer.

726
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,152
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking forward to it.

727
00:56:58,172 --> 00:56:58,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.

728
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:01,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you still get to make your own character and all that stuff.

729
00:57:01,654 --> 00:57:03,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually didn't play any of the make your own character ones.

730
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:07,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting tweet that actually came out in response to this.

731
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:11,413
[SPEAKER_02]: The game director, Daishi Odashima, actually tweeted this.

732
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:16,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked the company if we can call the game Soul Edge 2, but they said no.

733
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:24,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might give you an idea about where this is going also, because remember, the first Soul Calibur game, if you will, was really Soul Edge.

734
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:25,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

735
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:30,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Also news coming out of the event, Tekken X Street Fighter hasn't even started yet.

736
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:32,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind there's two games being made.

737
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:35,555
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.

738
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Namco Bandai has said they haven't even really started work on Tekken X Street Fighter yet.

739
00:57:40,258 --> 00:57:42,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, interesting.

740
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:48,284
[SPEAKER_02]: The quote from producer Katushiro Harada said, quote, we really haven't started on Tekken X Street Fighter.

741
00:57:48,624 --> 00:58:10,964
[SPEAKER_02]: things are going well with Street Fighter X Tekken and we'll have more on that at E3 we hope you look forward to that so I don't know maybe they're spacing the games out a little bit kind of interesting by the way speaking of Street Fighter X Tekken a new teaser came out for it this week and it shows Cammy so Cammy will be in the game which really doesn't surprise anyone I'm sure some other little bits and pieces that came out of that as well

742
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:16,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Ace Combat Assault Horizons coming out October 11th in the US and the 14th in Europe.

743
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:21,318
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new CG feature film based on Tekken called Tekken Blood Vengeance.

744
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:26,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Tales of Graces and Tales of Abyss also coming out on the PS3 and the 3DS respectively.

745
00:58:27,344 --> 00:58:35,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And wait for it, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact coming out on the PSP because your life just wasn't complete without another Naruto game.

746
00:58:36,255 --> 00:58:36,595
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

747
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:57,618
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

748
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And funny enough, totally ironically, I had no idea DarkSakura was going to pick this game.

749
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing this last night.

750
00:59:04,526 --> 00:59:04,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

751
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:06,769
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

752
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:07,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Oom Jamalami.

753
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:10,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Oom Jamalami.

754
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:11,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

755
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:14,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And I put in the one I thought was your favorite.

756
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:16,020
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite song in the soundtrack.

757
00:59:22,004 --> 00:59:28,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Umjermalami, yeah, and I did cover Parappa series, but I'm doing Umjermalami anyway, I don't care.

758
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:35,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Umjermalami was put out by Nana Onsha and Namco in the arcade.

759
00:59:35,547 --> 00:59:36,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the music died behind you.

760
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:38,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just YouTube's failing us tonight.

761
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:39,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

762
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:40,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being uber fail.

763
00:59:41,508 --> 01:00:04,881
[SPEAKER_07]: at any rate, it came out in Japan on March 18th, 1999 and in North America on August 17th, 1999 and yeah, it plays like Parappa, pretty much Namco released the arcade version and it had a guitar controller so that you could get the sensation of playing a guitar I mean, it's very similar to Guitar Freaks we've seen one of these machines, remember?

764
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:06,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I do!

765
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember the machine.

766
01:00:07,422 --> 01:00:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get on my knees to play it.

767
01:00:10,323 --> 01:00:10,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't.

768
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your minds out of the gutter, people.

769
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made for kids, and I'm a little tall.

770
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:18,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it's like a Simon Says sort of thing.

771
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:23,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, their characters will do something, and then you do something.

772
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:26,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to basically repeat whatever it tells you to do.

773
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:31,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And so through the game, you have a Chop Chop Master Onion from Parappa.

774
01:00:33,025 --> 01:00:35,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where you get Dojo Casino.

775
01:00:35,467 --> 01:00:36,387
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all in the mind.

776
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:38,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And she goes, yeah, my guitar is in my mind!

777
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:40,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

778
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:49,029
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole thing is basically Lammy trying to get to her concert with her group Milk Can at the Chop Shop Master Arena.

779
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:54,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And so she has to put out a fire and babysit babies with Kathy Pillar, which is this song.

780
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:55,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And then fly an airplane.

781
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:59,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And then chop down a tree to make a new guitar.

782
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:10,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she actually, well, gets sent to an island, but in the Japanese version she actually dies and goes to hell.

783
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:16,380
[SPEAKER_07]: and I found a movie file of that to play for everybody.

784
01:01:18,701 --> 01:01:19,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's my cue, isn't it?

785
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:20,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, hold on.

786
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:20,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is, Rob.

787
01:01:21,363 --> 01:01:22,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

788
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where Rob stops texting on his iPhone.

789
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me bring this up.

790
01:01:28,107 --> 01:01:28,727
Distortion.

791
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:29,028
Thank you.

792
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Two more minutes and I'm history.

793
01:01:52,394 --> 01:01:53,615
[SPEAKER_07]: She's running in front of traffic.

794
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:55,116
[SPEAKER_02]: These interludes were so bad.

795
01:01:55,696 --> 01:01:59,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Slips on the banana peel that PJ Berry is eating the bananas.

796
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:01,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Cracks her head.

797
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And dies.

798
01:02:05,482 --> 01:02:06,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid PJ Berry.

799
01:02:08,743 --> 01:02:09,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid fat bear.

800
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:22,614
[SPEAKER_07]: No bitch or 2D.

801
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:29,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think every time I show up to this show, too.

802
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:30,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the credits roll.

803
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:31,077
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.

804
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:46,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there's the guitarist!

805
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:47,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, hurry, hurry!

806
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:49,877
[SPEAKER_11]: We need you out there!

807
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:51,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet, not yet!

808
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:57,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she goes on stage with Teriyaki Yoko.

809
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:03,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that whole thing was cut out of the US version.

810
01:03:03,623 --> 01:03:06,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they had her showing up on a desert island.

811
01:03:08,172 --> 01:03:11,735
[SPEAKER_07]: and so it went into the whole Vital Idol song.

812
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:19,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And where she gets faxed back to life instead of teleported via fax from the island.

813
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.

814
01:03:23,824 --> 01:03:26,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I will tell you something, because I'll tell you why I would pick this.

815
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:28,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan and I discussed this today.

816
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:33,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was saying how I had a demo disc of this and it had...

817
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,713
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the stuff in the game just locked out.

818
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:44,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had the original, you know... Because in Chop Chop Master Onion's song it said, you could play in hell and go far.

819
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:50,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's on the demo disc, not on... Anyway, but all this was left in Europe and Japan.

820
01:03:50,503 --> 01:03:51,503
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the U.S.

821
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:54,025
[SPEAKER_07]: people had to get a stick up their butt and have her go to an island.

822
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, you have four different ranks.

823
01:03:57,768 --> 01:03:58,228
[SPEAKER_07]: You have...

824
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:05,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, you have bad, and you have awful, and if you get below awful, then your song ends.

825
01:04:06,113 --> 01:04:09,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And the quality of music changes also with each one too.

826
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:14,479
[SPEAKER_07]: But now you can also get cool, and so you basically can freestyle unless you really screw up.

827
01:04:14,899 --> 01:04:19,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you keep cool by the end of the song, you'll get a cool ending to the level.

828
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:23,365
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it flashes good, then you go back into normal play.

829
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:35,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for this one, you know, if you get cool, then Teriyaki Yoko goes, okay, you can go by yourself, and then you're in this tunnel, but if you drop back down to Goji, he goes, okay, well, you need me after all.

830
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:40,562
[SPEAKER_07]: But you also get different morphers to your sound.

831
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:46,263
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a flanger, you get a harmonizer, you get the wah-wah, you get distortion and a reverb.

832
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:49,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually from different items you get.

833
01:04:49,904 --> 01:05:00,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, in order, it's a fire siren, a caterpillar rattle, Captain Fuss and Pepper's false teeth, who was the headbanging pilot in, I think, Stage 4.

834
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:02,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, I love that stage.

835
01:05:02,808 --> 01:05:03,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I play that music?

836
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:03,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

837
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:05,569
[SPEAKER_02]: That music was awesome.

838
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,171
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I could never beat that unless I did it cool.

839
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:09,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

840
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,012
[SPEAKER_07]: That level, uh-huh.

841
01:05:10,112 --> 01:05:11,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But I could always get it to go cool.

842
01:05:12,713 --> 01:05:13,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me play a little bit.

843
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:19,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Horns on!

844
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,191
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a trap level.

845
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:27,296
[SPEAKER_09]: This person's going for cool, too, so... Anyhow.

846
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:27,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

847
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:27,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um...

848
01:05:43,864 --> 01:05:55,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you also got a fever time so that when you enter a level after it's been completed, it brings up a chocolate screen with symbols.

849
01:05:56,187 --> 01:06:04,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you input everything in the right order, when the level is cool, the screen goes really crazy and symbols fly all over the place.

850
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:09,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can hit those buttons repeatedly and get uber points.

851
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:28,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, the arcade version was called Um Jammer Lamy Now, and it had a guitar controller, and it had the buttons for triangle, circle, X, and square are strummers in the middle of the guitar, and the L button is a slider at the top of the guitar, and there's a scratch disc at the bottom instead of the R button.

852
01:06:29,734 --> 01:06:38,576
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really the same as the home version, and there is an ability to play with Parappa in that too.

853
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:46,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got Lamy mode, and then you have your co-op, which is Lamy and Ramy, who is the dark version of Lamy.

854
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you have Versus, which is Lamy versus Ramy.

855
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:55,429
[SPEAKER_07]: You have Solo Parappa, you have Lamy and Parappa, and then you have Versus, Lamy, and Parappa.

856
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have a special mode.

857
01:06:58,192 --> 01:06:59,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

858
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:06,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically, you can just listen to any of the songs in good, bad, awful, or cool mode.

859
01:07:07,472 --> 01:07:14,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, you could also do that if you had the PSX Play little program and could rip all your files, but I digress.

860
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:20,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you also had, like I said, there were the changes.

861
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:22,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I brought up the hell changes.

862
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:23,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

863
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:31,327
[SPEAKER_07]: But for Paul Chuck in Stage 5, instead of chopping trees down for the fun, it was changed knowing that we're here for the fun.

864
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, Teriyaki Yoko, like I said.

865
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:47,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And... Lammy is actually wearing a camouflage t-shirt and has jungle makeup to show that she's in the jungle.

866
01:07:47,259 --> 01:07:47,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh...

867
01:07:49,028 --> 01:08:17,398
[SPEAKER_07]: and then also the scene before stage 7 has Catty Cat and Masan riding a camel and the ending credits is an instrumental version of Keep Your Head Up and then Chop Chop Master Onion's music was of course changed the demo like I said has everything in it and then there was three soundtracks came out one called Make It Sweet which is all the music done by Milk Can and

868
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:30,444
[SPEAKER_07]: and there was called Ice Cream which was remixed versions of the songs and that was with Dread Fox as Parappa and then the whole original soundtrack which I've got somewhere.

869
01:08:31,044 --> 01:08:35,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, the game is super awesome, it's super fun and it's...

870
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:40,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Really great, but I still think it's stupid that they had to change it.

871
01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:46,235
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, GameVortex criticized it, and I think this is the best way of saying something.

872
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:49,758
[SPEAKER_07]: They said it was an unfortunate thing, and said, Did I miss some logical leap?

873
01:08:49,878 --> 01:08:52,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I think our kids can handle such a basic concept as hell.

874
01:08:53,602 --> 01:08:53,862
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

875
01:08:54,867 --> 01:08:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Um Jamalami.

876
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:02,613
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I was none the wiser when I first played this game, because, you know, I wasn't really following the import gaming scene, you know.

877
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:12,901
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I had bought a certain game, actually, it was at Anime Expo, and I talked my way into a demo disc, because I was so excited about this game.

878
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:13,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

879
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:15,327
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

880
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:17,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.

881
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:21,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere, guys.

882
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:25,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got plenty more to come in Part B tonight, including some other new game announcements.

883
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:30,297
[SPEAKER_02]: In Rapid Fire News tonight, a big arcade collection has been announced.

884
01:09:30,437 --> 01:09:34,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a big popular beta has been announced for later this year.

885
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be huge.

886
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:43,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we're going to get into some more lawsuits in Part B, some Portal 2 news, and, yeah, some more localization, or maybe not.

887
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:54,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlocalized games that you can still buy locally That'll make sense in a little bit Anyhow, we're going to take a break But stay tuned guys, we'll be back with more Of Orange Lounge Radio

888
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:01,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

889
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:25,899
[SPEAKER_02]: and some discussions there in part A about PlayStation Network, of course, coming back online, although I don't know, it's still a little spotty for some people.

890
01:10:26,259 --> 01:10:31,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster World 4 getting a localization finally, and of course the big story this week about Microsoft buying Skype.

891
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:35,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed in studio here that Loki is playing Portal 2.

892
01:10:35,624 --> 01:10:37,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very nice on your laptop, I gotta say.

893
01:10:37,325 --> 01:10:39,166
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics for that are pretty smooth.

894
01:10:39,586 --> 01:10:42,247
[SPEAKER_02]: You must have a pretty powerful little laptop there, I didn't realize.

895
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:42,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

896
01:10:43,128 --> 01:10:43,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

897
01:10:43,728 --> 01:10:44,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So, are you enjoying the game so far?

898
01:10:45,009 --> 01:10:45,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

899
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:47,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're pretty far into it, from what I can tell.

900
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:48,150
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

901
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:15,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I do Comic Insanity with Tiara, also known as Mar and Marvel, and Dan Shadow.

902
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:26,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a new one coming up on Tuesday with our new format, where we introduce a few new segments and condense a couple other segments.

903
01:11:26,023 --> 01:11:26,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's new stuff.

904
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:29,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.

905
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:35,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, with no I.

906
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

907
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my podcast that I do with my buddy, Extifer, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, about all things World of Warcraft.

908
01:11:44,364 --> 01:11:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not having a format switch this week, but I believe we're having DarkSakura on as our guest this week, so that'll be exciting.

909
01:11:49,446 --> 01:11:49,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

910
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:50,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

911
01:11:50,507 --> 01:12:03,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, you can check that out, www.hordehouse.com for more information about our little program there where we talk about the World of Warcraft, but never too seriously, because I'll tell you what, I've been kind of a jaded Warcraft player lately.

912
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:06,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have not been the most happy-go-lucky about the game.

913
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:09,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know everybody's like, well then quit, asshole!

914
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:15,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got too many friends that play, and how would I slay internet dragons without my WoW?

915
01:12:16,387 --> 01:12:19,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, more talk about World of Warcraft on that show.

916
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:20,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not fap to Warcraft.

917
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:29,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Although apparently, I don't want to give too much away, but apparently Extifer has been playing on a server notorious for the FAP chat.

918
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:33,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to give us a report on that this week, so that should be exciting.

919
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:36,393
[SPEAKER_02]: As a role player, you're going to really look forward to that, huh, DarkSakura?

920
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:38,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, baby.

921
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:43,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.

922
01:12:43,617 --> 01:12:48,218
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of little stories this week that unfortunately the PlayStation Network was kind of dominating over.

923
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:49,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's get to it.

924
01:12:49,838 --> 01:12:50,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, some quick stuff.

925
01:12:51,378 --> 01:12:53,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, your Twitter topic is coming up after this.

926
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,959
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't gotten your tweets in, you've got like two minutes to do it.

927
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:57,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

928
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:02,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Including one item that actually will be played on the PlayStation Network, Starhawk.

929
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:07,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the new, I guess, more futuristic sequel to Warhawk.

930
01:13:08,402 --> 01:13:10,883
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be coming soon, hopefully.

931
01:13:11,383 --> 01:13:13,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be something they show off at E3.

932
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:15,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been teased for a while.

933
01:13:15,965 --> 01:13:18,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I even think there's some assets or something that leaked out about it.

934
01:13:19,587 --> 01:13:21,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently... Oh, next year is when it's due out.

935
01:13:22,408 --> 01:13:24,809
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be the same kind of format as Warhawk was.

936
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:27,970
[SPEAKER_03]: They even promised space battles at some point.

937
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:30,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure how that's going to really work, but...

938
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:36,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a single-player story mode and a build-in battle system will be coming to it as well.

939
01:13:37,317 --> 01:13:41,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you like that game, you may want to check it out.

940
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:47,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the original game is really cheap right now, so if you want to check that out, it might be worth it.

941
01:13:48,586 --> 01:13:49,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course...

942
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:57,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yes, the developers of Splosion Man comes, uh, Splosion, uh, Ms.

943
01:13:58,013 --> 01:14:14,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Splosion Man, and, of course, not to, um, you know, pass up capitalizing on what might be an internet sensation, um, you know, 2G1C, you know, might, some people may think Two Girls, One Cup, but no, Two Girls, One Controller.

944
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:18,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in this game mode... I try not to think about Two Girls, One Cup ever.

945
01:14:19,527 --> 01:14:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

946
01:14:20,008 --> 01:14:20,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Loki.

947
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:28,172
[SPEAKER_03]: uh two girls one controller it's a different mode that's going to be in the game you're actually going to control each uh one of the Ms.

948
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:41,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Splosion men um with one analog stick on the controller and you would detonate them with the you know trigger buttons I believe so um it's interesting um

949
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:46,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that'll play, but it's something that they're throwing in that you can try out.

950
01:14:47,658 --> 01:14:54,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, as I was mentioning earlier, of course, a new update coming out for the Xbox 360.

951
01:14:54,765 --> 01:15:00,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna reflash those people that had modified firmwares on their DVD drives.

952
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:08,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to combat that, of course, people out there have tools to get around things.

953
01:15:08,977 --> 01:15:16,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And one hacker or toolmaker, I guess, Electron, has released eTool version 0.2.

954
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:24,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a new tool for extracting and injecting the key from the light-on fat drives that were flashed with the new firmware by the beta dash.

955
01:15:25,627 --> 01:15:34,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So because those firmwares, once they get flashed, it's unable to be read by popular programs like the Jungle Flasher and stuff like that.

956
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:40,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So now this program will actually read the keys from that and it will also read flashed drives for you.

957
01:15:40,313 --> 01:15:47,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a feeling that this new format that they're going to be putting out there will get bypassed very quickly.

958
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:51,317
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I have a feeling it will be bypassed within a month.

959
01:15:52,597 --> 01:15:54,498
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably being very generous.

960
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:01,014
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, yeah, that's it.

961
01:16:01,835 --> 01:16:02,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

962
01:16:02,795 --> 01:16:06,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that hack poses a pretty serious threat to all the research?

963
01:16:06,418 --> 01:16:07,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's one of the many.

964
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:18,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Commodore Forever, they're working on a new firmware for their all drives, actually, and I believe that already is almost done.

965
01:16:18,906 --> 01:16:22,128
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just doing some further testing with the new XGD3 format.

966
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:22,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um...

967
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:29,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming, though, that that's probably bypassing it.

968
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:34,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's also the X360 key, which is supposed to be coming out at some point.

969
01:16:34,893 --> 01:16:50,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to emulate the drive altogether, and that, I think, is the worst threat they could possibly have because right there, that's playing game ISOs off of a hard drive without needing to really modify your system.

970
01:16:50,256 --> 01:16:51,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's plug-and-play.

971
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:54,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You plug it in between your drive and the system.

972
01:16:55,637 --> 01:16:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

973
01:16:56,337 --> 01:16:57,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

974
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:22,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

975
01:17:41,843 --> 01:17:44,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It did finally go official, but it wasn't supposed to.

976
01:17:44,024 --> 01:17:47,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this was leaked early from the Korean side of Blizzard Entertainment.

977
01:17:48,145 --> 01:17:50,786
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new follower system in Diablo 3.

978
01:17:51,086 --> 01:17:54,487
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually hire characters to help you out in the game.

979
01:17:54,787 --> 01:18:02,130
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of sounds inspired by Torchlight, actually, because you can kind of have the pet and one of the classes, you can get all these little demon followers.

980
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

981
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But these followers will actually be in different classes.

982
01:18:05,513 --> 01:18:08,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Enchantress, Scoundrel, Templars.

983
01:18:08,175 --> 01:18:13,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be able to give these guys weapons, rings, and you'll even be able to give them their own skills.

984
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:17,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this really sounds like the pets from Torchlight, but maybe a little more fleshed out.

985
01:18:17,465 --> 01:18:18,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty exciting.

986
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:22,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Souls, this game is going to be hard as hell.

987
01:18:22,129 --> 01:18:24,051
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to come out October 11th.

988
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this is the unofficial, well, I shouldn't say unofficial, but the don't call it a sequel, but it is to Demon's Souls, which was one of those hard as hell games on the PlayStation 3.

989
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,503
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best hands down PlayStation 3 exclusive games.

990
01:18:37,404 --> 01:18:39,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Souls is going to be coming out on October 11th.

991
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:45,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though there's been the PlayStation Network outages and so forth, that's not going to stop them.

992
01:18:46,211 --> 01:18:58,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Kai Hirono, who's the producer of the game, spoke with CVG saying that the outage caused, quote, some problems for the development, but that the team is, quote, in contact with Sony and is aiming to meet a street date of October 11th.

993
01:18:58,798 --> 01:19:00,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's nice that Sony's talking to some of their people.

994
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, finally from me tonight, oh god, it's taken only 413 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio But finally, I get to report on a story about Lady Gaga And yes, it reports, I'm sorry, it relates to gaming That's right, Lady Gaga is coming to, I can't believe I'm going to say this either, Farmville Oh, I saw the ads for that

995
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:34,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Lady Gaga and Zynga a while ago had this whole donation for Japanese disaster relief going on.

996
01:19:35,318 --> 01:19:41,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that partnership has grown into the May 17th opening of GagaVille.

997
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:43,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be a...

998
01:19:43,789 --> 01:19:45,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

999
01:20:05,393 --> 01:20:06,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting.

1000
01:20:06,393 --> 01:20:10,015
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, I kind of looked at this and I was like, oh, God, really?

1001
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,116
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so gross.

1002
01:20:11,196 --> 01:20:14,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm going to have to go and play Farmville again if I want to hear new Gaga songs.

1003
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:16,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, fuck you, Lady Gaga.

1004
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:17,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do this.

1005
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:18,579
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I kind of thought about it.

1006
01:20:18,599 --> 01:20:25,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, actually, considering that, like, you know, Gaga's fan base is a lot of like, you know, let's face it, like.

1007
01:20:26,423 --> 01:20:26,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Losers?

1008
01:20:27,544 --> 01:20:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you Middle-aged to teenage girls And who's playing mostly Farmville?

1009
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:49,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Middle-aged to teenage girls So whereas I'm not super excited about this They're targeting the right audience So it is really smart marketing Of course, just as a person who's not a big fan of Zynga products I'm not that excited, but I get it

1010
01:20:49,952 --> 01:20:53,654
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on American Idol the other day, and I don't get it.

1011
01:20:54,234 --> 01:21:02,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't understand the appeal of her, and I have no appeal of her as a person, her as an artist, her music.

1012
01:21:02,497 --> 01:21:04,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's seriously lost on me.

1013
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I think her music's very catchy.

1014
01:21:06,522 --> 01:21:07,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's all about.

1015
01:21:07,323 --> 01:21:11,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think she's a very genuine person from her interviews and so forth.

1016
01:21:11,526 --> 01:21:12,167
[SPEAKER_03]: She's genuine.

1017
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:13,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand.

1018
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,090
[SPEAKER_02]: How strange can it be?

1019
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:21,034
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of marketing machine behind it, yes, but she's a living, breathing piece of art.

1020
01:21:21,214 --> 01:21:21,955
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I see her.

1021
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:25,418
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay if you don't get it.

1022
01:21:25,938 --> 01:21:27,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is meant to be interpreted in many different ways.

1023
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

1024
01:21:30,942 --> 01:21:31,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1025
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:34,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Being as strange as possible is not art.

1026
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:39,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How fucking crazy can I be?

1027
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:42,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, I'm not fucking calling what I do art.

1028
01:21:44,377 --> 01:21:46,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, if anyone calls it... I just keep thinking of Eddie Izzard now.

1029
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:50,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put poop on my head and sell myself to an art gallery.

1030
01:21:53,465 --> 01:21:58,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm waiting for the full fecal suit from Lady Gaga.

1031
01:21:59,007 --> 01:22:00,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on its way.

1032
01:22:00,388 --> 01:22:02,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the path she is traveling.

1033
01:22:02,129 --> 01:22:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when she's in the retirement home 50 years from now, she'll be wearing a poop suit.

1034
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:10,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, it's just going to be... I don't know.

1035
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:11,313
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll have...

1036
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:18,173
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll make some sort of suit out of some sort of dinosaur fossil.

1037
01:22:18,754 --> 01:22:23,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Come out there, you know, calling like an eagle or something like that.

1038
01:22:23,476 --> 01:22:25,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a giant dump on stage.

1039
01:22:25,957 --> 01:22:28,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll around in it and set herself on fire.

1040
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:29,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom!

1041
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:31,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Lady Gaga concert next year, okay?

1042
01:22:32,800 --> 01:23:01,108
[SPEAKER_07]: alright look I can't believe I'm about to say this but this is too much Lady Gaga chat for our show so let's move on with some more gaming news do you never saw the link I sent the two links I sent you what's that well you know I keep up with the gal fashion and one of the companies that I like their clothes is actually Lady Gaga's working with one of the men's styles to release a bunch of t-shirts I get all my news from the fuck yeah Lady Gaga Tumblr anyhow and I sent you paper dolls

1043
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:02,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1044
01:23:02,418 --> 01:23:03,079
[SPEAKER_02]: More gaming news.

1045
01:23:04,219 --> 01:23:06,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, how about Angry Birds?

1046
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:09,742
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Chrome OS and the Chrome browser.

1047
01:23:10,303 --> 01:23:14,885
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually play it now, apparently.

1048
01:23:16,226 --> 01:23:27,192
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free to play, has microtransactions, but the web-exclusive ones have Chrome bombs and exclusive Chrome levels and the pay-per-use Mighty Eagle.

1049
01:23:28,312 --> 01:23:29,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't care.

1050
01:23:30,574 --> 01:23:31,054
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Rob?

1051
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:34,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm just reading our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com.

1052
01:23:34,403 --> 01:23:37,243
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, doing OLR should be considered an art form.

1053
01:23:38,543 --> 01:23:42,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And SalaciousPop says, OMG, Lady Gaga channeling Gigi Allen.

1054
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:51,166
[SPEAKER_02]: He did all those, or maybe Alin, I don't know this artist, but he did all of those things that Loki just said, by the way, including the fire and the poop.

1055
01:23:52,326 --> 01:23:54,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's already been done, Loki, so Gaga can't do it.

1056
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:55,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1057
01:23:55,427 --> 01:23:56,427
[SPEAKER_07]: How about gaming?

1058
01:23:56,807 --> 01:23:57,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1059
01:23:57,188 --> 01:23:58,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Minecraft stuff.

1060
01:23:59,108 --> 01:24:11,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the creator, Marcus Pearson, has a poll on his blog about MinecraftCon, seeing if people would be interested in attending it in Las Vegas.

1061
01:24:11,912 --> 01:24:13,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a...

1062
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,881
[SPEAKER_07]: A no and a yes.

1063
01:24:17,061 --> 01:24:18,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And so far, no is winning.

1064
01:24:19,482 --> 01:24:25,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So... I will be bringing a bunch of blocks to put in front of the door to trap everyone in MinecraftCon.

1065
01:24:26,345 --> 01:24:34,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at the screen capture from, I'm guessing, from Minecraft and it looks completely... These people have too much damn time.

1066
01:24:35,495 --> 01:24:36,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So how about Mortal Kombat?

1067
01:24:37,216 --> 01:24:37,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

1068
01:24:38,216 --> 01:24:44,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Minecraft con's not a terrible idea because, hell, they have cons for people that dress up like furry animals.

1069
01:24:44,318 --> 01:24:55,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if the furries can have their con... Mortal Kombat Collection will be... The original trilogy will be going on the Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.

1070
01:24:56,181 --> 01:25:02,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, collection is spelled with a K. And it will also be on PC for 800 Microsoft points.

1071
01:25:02,724 --> 01:25:04,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Lady Gaga have a convention?

1072
01:25:05,885 --> 01:25:07,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it be called Gaga for GagaCon?

1073
01:25:07,846 --> 01:25:08,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

1074
01:25:08,587 --> 01:25:09,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Cher has a convention.

1075
01:25:09,828 --> 01:25:11,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I ever tell you about that story?

1076
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:11,349
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1077
01:25:11,549 --> 01:25:12,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in LA.

1078
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Woodland Hills specifically for work doing some stuff down there.

1079
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:22,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was staying at a hotel and I get in this elevator with literally 15 people all decked out in Cher shirts and concert.

1080
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:24,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, oh, is Cher in town?

1081
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,821
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, no, there's a Cher convention going on here at the hotel.

1082
01:25:27,261 --> 01:25:29,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, is she here?

1083
01:25:29,883 --> 01:25:31,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, she's in France.

1084
01:25:31,784 --> 01:25:32,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh.

1085
01:25:33,286 --> 01:25:35,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But she sent a video or something like that.

1086
01:25:35,427 --> 01:26:04,373
[SPEAKER_02]: if I can turn back time I literally walked into a Cher convention and despite what you may think about homosexuals I'm not like screaming ah for Cher like she's cool I think she's pretty fierce I want to watch the show about Chaz oh I don't yeah I don't really follow the Cher stuff but my mother loves Cher I got dragged to a Cher concert by my mother Rob I just love Cher she's so funny she's such a diva Rob I like your mom

1087
01:26:06,226 --> 01:26:07,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I want your mom to adopt me.

1088
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:09,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe she's younger than me though.

1089
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

1090
01:26:12,112 --> 01:26:13,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Mortal Kombat Collection.

1091
01:26:13,393 --> 01:26:13,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.

1092
01:26:14,314 --> 01:26:19,539
[SPEAKER_02]: If we didn't already have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox Live Arcade and Mortal Kombat 2 on PlayStation Network.

1093
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But didn't they stop selling 3 or something?

1094
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:23,603
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.

1095
01:26:23,863 --> 01:26:26,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was delisted some time ago.

1096
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:30,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was delisted after they decided hey, we're going to re-release it again.

1097
01:26:30,129 --> 01:26:30,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha!

1098
01:26:32,649 --> 01:26:32,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1099
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:36,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Ranma in our chatroom says, Gaga convention?

1100
01:26:37,032 --> 01:26:38,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the West Village, Rob.

1101
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:39,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So noted.

1102
01:26:40,635 --> 01:26:48,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to pick up that whole Mortal Kombat with the new arcade stick they're going to put out, though, because Mortal Kombat 2 especially was so awesome.

1103
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:54,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they were, whatever happened to, they were supposed to be putting out an HD collection or something like that on the PlayStation 3.

1104
01:26:54,364 --> 01:26:55,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be all the Mortal Kombat games.

1105
01:26:55,966 --> 01:26:57,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's this.

1106
01:26:58,067 --> 01:27:14,442
[SPEAKER_03]: but this isn't this or this isn't that it's basically just hey look we're porting the shit straight over we're not doing anything to it hey you know what it's too much work to actually do something let's just release the old shit

1107
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to some Twitter.

1108
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:18,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it the Nintendo way.

1109
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:20,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the tweets.

1110
01:27:20,924 --> 01:27:22,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1111
01:27:22,925 --> 01:27:23,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1112
01:27:24,106 --> 01:27:26,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys tweet us and we read your tweets.

1113
01:27:26,887 --> 01:27:29,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're going to tweet something that we're going to talk about on the show in about 30 minutes.

1114
01:27:29,748 --> 01:27:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1115
01:27:31,389 --> 01:27:32,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not Benji.

1116
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:33,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Sends us a tweet.

1117
01:27:33,029 --> 01:27:33,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then who are you?

1118
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:36,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Sends us a tweet saying, can I pre-F you?

1119
01:27:37,331 --> 01:27:40,833
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, F you to being at a place tonight where I can't listen to OLR.

1120
01:27:41,213 --> 01:27:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: That is screwed up.

1121
01:27:42,714 --> 01:27:43,054
[SPEAKER_02]: F that.

1122
01:27:43,974 --> 01:27:58,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say though, just a tip, if you are a smartphone owner, especially like the iPhones, I'm not sure how well this works on Android and the other stuff because I'm an iPhone owner, but allgames.com runs on HTML5, so you can actually get the feed by just going to allgames.com on your iPhone or whatever.

1123
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:00,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So just saying, just for future reference.

1124
01:28:02,746 --> 01:28:05,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf tweeted us that he has now sent the best email ever.

1125
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it.

1126
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:13,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny T-Man tweets us saying this is a fun little Metroidvania type game I found.

1127
01:28:14,418 --> 01:28:16,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to the link here.

1128
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:21,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's IndieGames.com and the game is called Hydra Castle Labyrinth Buster.

1129
01:28:22,826 --> 01:28:25,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe that's the author, I don't know, but Hydra Castle Labyrinth.

1130
01:28:25,688 --> 01:28:32,331
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a freeware 2D platformer created by E. Hashimoto, who made Akuji the Demon and Guardian of Paradise.

1131
01:28:33,752 --> 01:28:39,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It's similar to La Mulana, uh-oh, I hear Dark Tetsuya running to download this immediately, and the Castlevania series.

1132
01:28:40,236 --> 01:28:44,278
[SPEAKER_02]: The health gauge and sub-weapon indicator are both displayed on the top left corner of the screen.

1133
01:28:45,219 --> 01:29:02,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydra Castle Labyrinth you can download from Buster's site hp.vector.co.jp this sounds pretty cool and it's only 1.25 megs I will kindly link this in our chat room so if you guys want to check that out there you go enjoy

1134
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:06,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Dark Tetsuya has already played it.

1135
01:29:06,381 --> 01:29:07,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so not surprised.

1136
01:29:07,362 --> 01:29:08,944
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1137
01:29:09,084 --> 01:29:10,906
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt tweets us a couple things.

1138
01:29:10,986 --> 01:29:13,288
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is coming up a little later in the show, but the other one I want to mention this.

1139
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:18,674
[SPEAKER_02]: With arcades being closed down, a new video game themed lounge has opened up in Las Vegas.

1140
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:19,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks nice.

1141
01:29:20,075 --> 01:29:23,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I heard there's a new arcade in San Francisco as well.

1142
01:29:23,799 --> 01:29:41,566
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't remember for the life of me what the name is maybe somebody in chat will figure it out for me but there's a new arcade in San Francisco I think I haven't been to yet and now apparently there's this place called Insert Coins in Las Vegas it's a video lounge game bar yeah I remember seeing that huh that sounds kind of neat a while ago

1143
01:29:42,684 --> 01:30:03,558
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the website here that I'm on right now, Insert Coins will electrify all your senses with its revolutionary amalgamation of classic arcades, ultra lounge service, console video gaming, and the world's greatest video DJs, all under its 7,000 square foot roof, nestled in the iconic neon-laden Fremont East District of Las Vegas.

1144
01:30:04,019 --> 01:30:05,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually sounds kind of awesome, I gotta say.

1145
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's video games meets booze meets loud music.

1146
01:30:11,704 --> 01:30:39,121
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds awesome maybe this type of shit's ready to make a resurgence that's kind of what I'm hoping like you know I gotta say when I went to Portland one of the most awesome places I went to was the um barcade that they had there and I apologize I forget the name of it but it's just thank you ground control Dan's yelling it from the other room ground control yeah that place was isn't that place fucking rad Dan oh god Dan you gotta go oh my god it's it's beer and 80s games

1147
01:30:41,368 --> 01:30:42,649
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Dan says road trip.

1148
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:44,830
[SPEAKER_02]: We might just have to.

1149
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:45,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1150
01:30:47,491 --> 01:30:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, you know, it's a bummer you're starting school that week because before we go to L.A., we could go to Portland and go to ground control.

1151
01:30:56,114 --> 01:30:57,815
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, screw DarkSakura.

1152
01:30:57,895 --> 01:30:58,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I will go, Dan.

1153
01:30:58,916 --> 01:30:59,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

1154
01:31:02,517 --> 01:31:04,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I are going to go on a broad trip.

1155
01:31:09,824 --> 01:31:13,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan said the first gayest thing he did was play rock band at Matt's party.

1156
01:31:27,657 --> 01:31:30,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let me move on to some more tweets.

1157
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:38,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator PSN tweets us saying, PlayStation Network is down again as of 9pm Eastern, 6pm Pacific.

1158
01:31:38,689 --> 01:31:47,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well wait a minute Spazinator, maybe you just need to try it four times before you get in like I had to do earlier, but I'm looking at the official PlayStation blog, guess what?

1159
01:31:48,328 --> 01:31:51,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, not even 24 hours after it came back up, PlayStation Network had to go back down.

1160
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:51,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1161
01:32:17,878 --> 01:32:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's all I'm going to say about that.

1162
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:20,841
[SPEAKER_02]: What a whore.

1163
01:32:21,122 --> 01:32:22,323
[SPEAKER_02]: More tweets.

1164
01:32:22,443 --> 01:32:22,664
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1165
01:32:22,724 --> 01:32:23,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you call it a whore?

1166
01:32:23,985 --> 01:32:24,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1167
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:25,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Had to go back down.

1168
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:33,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Tigerclaw sends us a couple tweets.

1169
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I guess I just reported on one of them.

1170
01:32:35,631 --> 01:32:43,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll read this other one about the Sony Online Entertainment senior producer is now the Zynga Austin GM.

1171
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:45,313
[SPEAKER_02]: That's John Blakely.

1172
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:49,814
[SPEAKER_02]: He did some projects including Star Wars Galaxies and DC Universe Onlines.

1173
01:32:50,194 --> 01:32:52,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's leading Zynga in Austin.

1174
01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:56,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went from the dark side to the darker side.

1175
01:32:57,595 --> 01:32:58,695
[SPEAKER_02]: All from his LinkedIn profile.

1176
01:33:00,696 --> 01:33:01,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1177
01:33:02,722 --> 01:33:07,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Candid Critique sends us a tweet saying, Someone makes Counter-Strike Osama compound map.

1178
01:33:08,003 --> 01:33:08,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay or nay?

1179
01:33:09,124 --> 01:33:12,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought something like this we had discussed on the show this week.

1180
01:33:12,664 --> 01:33:14,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And this isn't all too surprising.

1181
01:33:15,605 --> 01:33:19,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Give a bunch of gamers a blank palette and controversial things are sure to be made.

1182
01:33:19,746 --> 01:33:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere from nude patches to overly violent things to real life scenarios that may or may not be kind of tacky playing out.

1183
01:33:27,808 --> 01:33:37,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, and we get linked to this article here about the Pakistani compound where Osama Bin Laden, of course, I mean, unless you've been living under a fucking rock, was found and killed by U.S.

1184
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:42,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Navy SEALs, is now a playable mod in, what is this, Counter-Strike.

1185
01:33:43,591 --> 01:33:44,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

1186
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:53,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can go into Counter-Strike and play this game, and not only can I play real-life news, but I can get called every name in the book while doing it, because Counter-Strike has a really rude online community, just so you know.

1187
01:33:54,774 --> 01:33:55,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly...

1188
01:33:56,414 --> 01:33:57,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a question for the host.

1189
01:33:57,635 --> 01:33:58,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I like these tweets.

1190
01:33:58,995 --> 01:34:00,316
[SPEAKER_02]: They're questions for the host.

1191
01:34:00,536 --> 01:34:01,977
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this really should all be about.

1192
01:34:01,997 --> 01:34:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But here you go.

1193
01:34:02,877 --> 01:34:11,421
[SPEAKER_02]: TheBaconBits tweets us, IDK if it's been asked before, but what is your guys' favorite game soundtrack of all time?

1194
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, mine is the SMG OST.

1195
01:34:14,702 --> 01:34:17,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that means Super Mario Galaxy OST.

1196
01:34:17,603 --> 01:34:21,585
[SPEAKER_02]: BaconBits asking, what is your favorite game soundtrack of all time?

1197
01:34:21,905 --> 01:34:22,465
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

1198
01:34:22,485 --> 01:34:22,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

1199
01:34:30,984 --> 01:34:36,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't know, but I'd have to say maybe Bust Move 2.

1200
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:37,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1201
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:39,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it had a really good soundtrack.

1202
01:34:40,573 --> 01:34:40,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1203
01:34:42,870 --> 01:35:10,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know it would have to be kind of a toss up between well I did like I listened the crap out of the Dance Dance Revolution 4th mix soundtrack when that was out because I actually bought that at an anime convention which is pretty awesome I'd say it's either between 4th, 5th, Max 2 or DJ Hero 1 because DJ Hero 2 is kind of dumb

1204
01:35:12,356 --> 01:35:28,489
[SPEAKER_02]: As tempted as I am to throw in a Bomani soundtrack like DDR3rd Mix, probably my favorite soundtrack ever, or Beatmania 2D X-Fist style, honestly, I go to the Super Nintendo, and there's three games on the Super Nintendo that for me all kind of tie, maybe one slightly ahead for first place.

1205
01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:30,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm going to add Super Metroid to the list.

1206
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:33,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Metroid would be on my top three, absolutely.

1207
01:35:34,253 --> 01:35:38,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call it would also be up there.

1208
01:35:38,654 --> 01:35:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think just the slight edge, I think probably the greatest video game soundtrack ever made, ActRaiser.

1209
01:35:46,076 --> 01:35:47,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the ActRaiser soundtrack.

1210
01:35:47,756 --> 01:35:49,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It is beautiful, gorgeous music.

1211
01:35:49,136 --> 01:35:51,777
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what actually I'd have to add to my list would be Chrono Trigger.

1212
01:35:52,477 --> 01:35:54,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Chrono Trigger's got a pretty fucking sweet soundtrack.

1213
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Link to a Pass is pretty awesome too.

1214
01:35:57,598 --> 01:36:01,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna find my favorite piece of music in Chrono Trigger and send it to you to play.

1215
01:36:02,603 --> 01:36:03,243
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you do that.

1216
01:36:04,044 --> 01:36:06,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe next week during the break.

1217
01:36:06,645 --> 01:36:07,946
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of music breaks tonight.

1218
01:36:08,506 --> 01:36:10,207
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's going to do it for the tweets.

1219
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:12,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get in early for next week.

1220
01:36:13,169 --> 01:36:15,230
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, more news.

1221
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh boy, it's the lawsuit segment time.

1222
01:36:18,972 --> 01:36:19,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1223
01:36:19,812 --> 01:36:20,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1224
01:36:20,553 --> 01:36:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: This is retarded, but a former Navy... Now, Loki, don't use the R word.

1225
01:36:26,015 --> 01:36:26,936
[SPEAKER_07]: You can say butt-tarded.

1226
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's retarded.

1227
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:50,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It was his first seizure he had ever had, and it was violent enough to break a bone.

1228
01:36:51,982 --> 01:36:57,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess he's permanently barred from flying the F-18 planes, which he was trained on.

1229
01:36:57,868 --> 01:37:03,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's suing them because he says Oblivion was designed that it exceeds the upper acceptable limit of...

1230
01:37:04,014 --> 01:37:05,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullshit, they're in the manual.

1231
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:08,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Every fucking manual has a goddamn epilepsy warning in it.

1232
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that is some serious bullshit right there.

1233
01:37:31,742 --> 01:37:36,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, he wants damages for negligence, breach of warranty, and product liability.

1234
01:37:39,435 --> 01:37:40,056
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gonna lose.

1235
01:37:40,973 --> 01:38:09,468
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, every goddamn manual and fuck, every goddamn manual like, since games had manuals have had that warning in there, I think like from the Nintendo, well I'm sure they've had manuals for games before that, but like Nintendo, I think was one of the first you know series of games or whatever, they had manuals that had that warning in there because I always thought it was ridiculous, but I mean people have seizures because of flashing lights sometimes, but

1236
01:38:11,676 --> 01:38:14,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, just take some responsibility for yourself.

1237
01:38:28,703 --> 01:38:30,505
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1238
01:38:47,945 --> 01:38:48,905
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1239
01:39:09,413 --> 01:39:10,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I have thrown up.

1240
01:39:10,614 --> 01:39:11,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal 2 made me throw up.

1241
01:39:11,895 --> 01:39:14,657
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to control yourself.

1242
01:39:14,898 --> 01:39:19,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, some people have limits and you've got to control those limits.

1243
01:39:20,263 --> 01:39:22,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn the brightness down on your TV when you play Oblivion or something.

1244
01:39:22,964 --> 01:39:28,488
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't blame a game for a problem that clearly existed before that.

1245
01:39:29,849 --> 01:39:40,896
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got person A who has zero inclination towards epilepsy, and you've got person B who doesn't know they have any inclination towards epilepsy, but they do.

1246
01:39:41,437 --> 01:39:43,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And you sit them both in front of the same product.

1247
01:39:43,378 --> 01:39:49,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, of course, the one who has the inclination, whether they know about it or not, is going to react to it.

1248
01:39:50,002 --> 01:39:52,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like how I found out I was allergic to bell peppers.

1249
01:39:53,463 --> 01:39:53,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know.

1250
01:39:53,963 --> 01:39:54,683
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom eats them.

1251
01:39:55,403 --> 01:39:57,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate a bell pepper, my tongue swelled up, and I got sick.

1252
01:39:59,304 --> 01:39:59,584
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

1253
01:40:00,644 --> 01:40:01,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides that, they're nasty.

1254
01:40:01,724 --> 01:40:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackwolf in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, at least he got the seizure while playing a video game rather than while flying.

1255
01:40:08,185 --> 01:40:15,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so like I said, would you rather he fly in a plane and get a seizure than crash into, I don't know, an orphanage, a mall, children, schools?

1256
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:15,967
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1257
01:40:19,492 --> 01:40:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's talk about another lawsuit, and this one, oh boy.

1258
01:40:23,694 --> 01:40:26,397
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a lawsuit against Chuck E. Cheese.

1259
01:40:27,197 --> 01:40:30,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it for the fact that they got rid of all their good arcade games?

1260
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I wanted to join in on that one.

1261
01:40:31,962 --> 01:40:32,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, sort of.

1262
01:40:34,163 --> 01:40:41,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lawsuit against the ticket dispensing games at Chuck E. Cheese because it creates gambling addiction in little children.

1263
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:43,772
[SPEAKER_02]: A lawsuit has been filed in California.

1264
01:40:44,232 --> 01:40:46,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for $5 million.

1265
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:48,496
[SPEAKER_02]: The person who filed the lawsuit, Denise Keller.

1266
01:40:48,536 --> 01:40:50,978
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a mom, two girls, five and three years old.

1267
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:55,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Chuck E. Cheese's arcade games are akin to slot machines, says the complaint.

1268
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:06,525
[SPEAKER_02]: By offering tickets as a payout that can be redeemed for prizes, the machines, quote, create the same highs and lows experienced by adults who gamble their paychecks or the mortgage payment.

1269
01:41:07,185 --> 01:41:10,707
[SPEAKER_02]: The lawyer says, it's not about the money, it's about the kids.

1270
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:14,448
[SPEAKER_02]: California law forbids gambling

1271
01:41:36,016 --> 01:41:41,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it, the Indian casinos are in Indian land, I understand that And the California lottery?

1272
01:41:41,759 --> 01:41:45,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the lottery, so they don't ban gambling that well, you know what I mean?

1273
01:41:47,382 --> 01:41:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow, it does make an exception for payouts if the contest is predominantly a game of skill Which, as you know, these crane games and skee-ball games and so forth, they are of course mainly games of skill

1274
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1275
01:42:22,288 --> 01:42:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

1276
01:42:24,089 --> 01:42:26,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even understand the problem here.

1277
01:42:26,151 --> 01:42:32,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually would take an unpopular opinion somewhat with this and say she actually kind of has a point with this whole thing.

1278
01:42:32,275 --> 01:42:35,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think this is probably not healthy for all children.

1279
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:36,798
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time.

1280
01:42:38,007 --> 01:42:39,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Why sue Chuck E. Cheese over it?

1281
01:42:39,788 --> 01:42:43,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous because you absolutely have the right to not go there.

1282
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:44,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1283
01:42:45,091 --> 01:42:58,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if enough people didn't go to Chuck E. Cheese and didn't go have their birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and let their kids have birthday parties there, they would probably have to get rid of these machines or the company would go bankrupt or maybe they'd go back to having legitimate arcade games.

1284
01:42:58,999 --> 01:42:59,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1285
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:06,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know why, you know, all of these, because Ticket Redemption games have been around forever since I was a little kid.

1286
01:43:06,725 --> 01:43:06,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1287
01:43:07,246 --> 01:43:08,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not forever, don't say that.

1288
01:43:08,747 --> 01:43:14,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, but why is it that we're just now getting somebody complaining about it?

1289
01:43:14,572 --> 01:43:18,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't get it, especially when everybody else seems to be just fine with it.

1290
01:43:18,476 --> 01:43:20,998
[SPEAKER_07]: People can get addicted to anything.

1291
01:43:21,018 --> 01:43:21,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not finished.

1292
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:22,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1293
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:22,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1294
01:43:24,941 --> 01:43:26,682
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole point is that it's a parenting issue.

1295
01:43:27,802 --> 01:43:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want your kids to participate in something, you don't take them there, or you don't let them play it.

1296
01:43:33,025 --> 01:43:36,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Many ticket games are a test of skill.

1297
01:43:36,607 --> 01:43:38,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Some ticket games are goddamn bullshit.

1298
01:43:38,888 --> 01:43:39,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

1299
01:43:39,909 --> 01:43:44,391
[SPEAKER_02]: The Legend of Zaku says, Remember kids, America equals Sue the Bastard's Land.

1300
01:43:44,692 --> 01:43:45,832
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he kind of has a point.

1301
01:43:45,952 --> 01:43:49,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost think she's teaching these kids a worse lesson by going through with this lawsuit.

1302
01:43:49,914 --> 01:43:50,615
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my opinion.

1303
01:43:51,255 --> 01:43:52,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the way it is now.

1304
01:43:52,295 --> 01:43:57,458
[SPEAKER_03]: If people find an opportunity to make money, they're going to gamble their chances and do it.

1305
01:43:57,538 --> 01:44:03,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people can make the argument that they can be addicted to anything.

1306
01:44:04,181 --> 01:44:05,841
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get rid of everything?

1307
01:44:05,941 --> 01:44:07,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's really what it's going to come down to.

1308
01:44:07,882 --> 01:44:12,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You get rid of these ticket redemption games, they're going to say, oh, well, I'm addicted to winning at arcade games.

1309
01:44:12,744 --> 01:44:14,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you get rid of the arcade games.

1310
01:44:14,465 --> 01:44:15,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I'm addicted to...

1311
01:44:18,155 --> 01:44:18,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1312
01:44:19,956 --> 01:44:24,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Riding in little motorized cars that they have at Chuck E. Cheese or something like that.

1313
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we gotta get rid of those too.

1314
01:44:26,581 --> 01:44:28,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, now I'm addicted to eating pizza.

1315
01:44:28,883 --> 01:44:29,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get rid of pizza.

1316
01:44:30,524 --> 01:44:31,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does it stop?

1317
01:44:31,485 --> 01:44:35,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just people are gonna be finding anything to sue over.

1318
01:44:36,628 --> 01:44:41,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, unfortunately, is the latest in many, I'm sure, lawsuits that are gonna be

1319
01:44:43,831 --> 01:44:44,612
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1320
01:45:02,352 --> 01:45:03,553
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1321
01:45:24,608 --> 01:45:25,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1322
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:44,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they cry and have a tantrum, then you give them a timeout or you spank them.

1323
01:45:44,222 --> 01:45:47,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it seriously that terrible to parent your child?

1324
01:45:47,804 --> 01:45:52,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, shit, I know as being a parent, it's not that hard to say no.

1325
01:45:52,586 --> 01:45:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only a parent, a Mensa member.

1326
01:45:58,354 --> 01:45:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1327
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:19,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I lie and say I'm a Mensa member and just say as a Mensa member?

1328
01:46:19,939 --> 01:46:21,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get sued, probably.

1329
01:46:21,859 --> 01:46:23,139
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

1330
01:46:23,179 --> 01:46:24,920
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some hilarious shit in here.

1331
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:26,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sorry to get sidetracked here very quick.

1332
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and read this comment real quick.

1333
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,821
[SPEAKER_02]: AkumaJP in our chatroom at chat.orangehauntry.com.

1334
01:46:31,061 --> 01:46:32,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is addicted to Grand Theft Auto for sure.

1335
01:46:33,581 --> 01:46:33,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1336
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:34,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1337
01:46:35,301 --> 01:46:41,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I spend an unhealthy amount of my day thinking about Grand Theft Auto, playing Grand Theft Auto.

1338
01:46:41,623 --> 01:46:43,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I may or may not be addicted to World of Warcraft.

1339
01:46:44,305 --> 01:46:47,888
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's face it, everyone is addicted to video games.

1340
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:51,050
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's not that I'm addicted to Grand Theft Auto.

1341
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:54,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I have fun playing Grand Theft Auto and I have fun modding Grand Theft Auto.

1342
01:46:55,352 --> 01:46:58,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that a problem that I like doing something, you know?

1343
01:46:58,654 --> 01:46:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I can't stop.

1344
01:46:59,815 --> 01:47:00,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not allowed to have fun!

1345
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:04,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1346
01:47:07,162 --> 01:47:08,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to tell you something.

1347
01:47:08,404 --> 01:47:09,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really hilarious.

1348
01:47:09,445 --> 01:47:12,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to find, and my wife was reading this to me.

1349
01:47:12,088 --> 01:47:13,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here it is.

1350
01:47:13,389 --> 01:47:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is it right here.

1351
01:47:17,413 --> 01:47:20,497
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some rules or whatever that they have.

1352
01:47:21,738 --> 01:47:23,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, member policies.

1353
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:24,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1354
01:47:25,282 --> 01:47:26,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you allowed to read these?

1355
01:47:27,796 --> 01:47:30,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not like it's some secret guide or something.

1356
01:47:30,617 --> 01:47:35,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not masonry.

1357
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:43,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyways, one of the things, yeah, you can't really say something as like saying, oh, well, as a member of Mensa, I believe blah, blah, blah.

1358
01:47:44,343 --> 01:47:46,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But that wasn't even the part that I thought was ridiculous.

1359
01:47:46,764 --> 01:47:48,485
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you a sample press.

1360
01:47:48,505 --> 01:47:50,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I kid you not.

1361
01:47:50,145 --> 01:47:57,408
[SPEAKER_03]: A sample press release of how you can form your own press release to send out to your local paper and your friends saying that you got in the Mensa.

1362
01:47:57,768 --> 01:47:58,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not that vain.

1363
01:47:59,049 --> 01:47:59,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1364
01:48:00,289 --> 01:48:01,770
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what though?

1365
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:09,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in a suburbia town, in a big market like Sacramento, as much as we joke about ourselves, we are still the 20th largest market in the nation.

1366
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:13,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But go to the Midwest, in a lot of those little towns, maybe it is kind of a big deal.

1367
01:48:13,037 --> 01:48:17,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like putting a big giant sign on my back that says, Nerd!

1368
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Make fun of me!

1369
01:48:20,943 --> 01:48:22,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat my ass while you're at it!

1370
01:48:23,224 --> 01:48:27,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm not going to invite that kind of attention.

1371
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:29,806
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1372
01:48:30,327 --> 01:48:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next story up is DarkSakura's, but she's left, so... She has left the building.

1373
01:48:34,809 --> 01:48:38,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk more about... Let's sue her for not fulfilling her obligations.

1374
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:40,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm addicted to garden burgers, and I was preparing mine.

1375
01:48:40,893 --> 01:48:41,213
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1376
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:43,034
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know what?

1377
01:48:43,074 --> 01:48:43,334
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1378
01:48:43,354 --> 01:48:44,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm suing garden burgers.

1379
01:48:44,155 --> 01:48:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get rid of those crappy garden burgers.

1380
01:48:45,616 --> 01:48:46,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Goddamn you, garden burgers.

1381
01:48:47,057 --> 01:48:48,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm suing you because I thought you were meat.

1382
01:48:48,257 --> 01:48:51,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal 2 Authoring Tools is now available for beta for PC gamers.

1383
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:53,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up, Dan!

1384
01:48:54,481 --> 01:48:55,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you!

1385
01:48:57,083 --> 01:48:57,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1386
01:48:57,363 --> 01:48:57,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1387
01:48:59,739 --> 01:49:27,580
[SPEAKER_07]: so for people who want to do more for Portal 2 Valve has Portal 2 authoring tools yay if you've got a PC you can do this it's free for anyone who owns the game on PC and it's in the tools tab on your Steam account so basically you'll just be able to go into everything character skins, single player co-op levels, sound effects, music, 3D models they are all there you can do them all but there's also that sounds nasty

1388
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:37,065
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also an updated version of Faceposer and different example maps and instances to help you learn.

1389
01:49:38,106 --> 01:49:41,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there's a new suite of command line compiling utilities.

1390
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:46,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I want someone to make the Orange Lounge level.

1391
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Make the Orange Lounge level, put it up.

1392
01:49:52,535 --> 01:49:52,855
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1393
01:49:52,916 --> 01:49:53,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you looking at doors?

1394
01:49:54,457 --> 01:49:55,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at something from online.

1395
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that Alan's doing.

1396
01:49:59,483 --> 01:49:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1397
01:50:00,204 --> 01:50:00,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1398
01:50:01,285 --> 01:50:02,647
[SPEAKER_02]: He's probably giggling that that came out.

1399
01:50:02,707 --> 01:50:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1400
01:50:03,608 --> 01:50:04,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1401
01:50:04,669 --> 01:50:05,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you have for us?

1402
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1403
01:50:07,572 --> 01:50:09,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of funny.

1404
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:12,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the PlayStation 1 Classics...

1405
01:50:13,098 --> 01:50:15,180
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been slow to sell.

1406
01:50:16,462 --> 01:50:24,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, no one's wanting to buy your PlayStation 1 games to play them on a device that most likely doesn't have buttons.

1407
01:50:25,230 --> 01:50:31,356
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, these are actually meant for the Xperia Play Phone, the PlayStation phone, if you will.

1408
01:50:32,217 --> 01:50:40,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, apparently, I guess, there's only, um, you know, very few, uh, sales for each one.

1409
01:50:40,602 --> 01:50:51,249
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that under a thousand installs for each title, uh, Cool Porters 2, Destruction Derby, Medieval, Siphon Filter, and Jumping Flash, and most of those are actually only in the few hundreds.

1410
01:50:52,269 --> 01:51:04,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're saying that also that, um, they're saying it's not really a concern since there's only a few, um, at the, um, moment, but PlayStation 1 titles, um, here are there.

1411
01:51:05,181 --> 01:51:11,547
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more coming on a regular basis, he said, and as a whole PlayStation as a content provider exclusive to the device.

1412
01:51:11,988 --> 01:51:13,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no real concerns.

1413
01:51:13,389 --> 01:51:17,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a revolutionary device and it's shaking up the marketplace and we're very pleased with it.

1414
01:51:18,353 --> 01:51:23,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also it should be meant, you know, there's a reason why that maybe it's not working.

1415
01:51:23,076 --> 01:51:29,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because, um, not necessarily on the marketplace, but you can get it for that phone.

1416
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:36,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there actually are other PlayStation emulators that you can download ROMs for, and those don't cost you anything.

1417
01:51:38,645 --> 01:51:39,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that's the issue.

1418
01:51:40,246 --> 01:51:45,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are just buying the phone because, you know what, it's kind of cool to play other games with buttons.

1419
01:51:47,657 --> 01:51:48,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Xperia Play Fine

1420
01:52:14,637 --> 01:52:21,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it has a PlayStation controller setup on it doesn't mean people are going to necessarily buy just PlayStation 1 games with it.

1421
01:52:22,263 --> 01:52:30,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can get a bunch of other games that support this type of controller mapping and you can play those just fine.

1422
01:52:30,831 --> 01:52:36,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever thought that maybe a game that was put out 10 years ago might not stand up well against...

1423
01:52:37,476 --> 01:52:38,297
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the newer games.

1424
01:52:38,417 --> 01:52:41,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think Sony's just losing touch there with what people want.

1425
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:49,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, Cool Borders is a pretty fun game and Destruction Derby's not bad on its own and Medieval's alright, but I don't know.

1426
01:52:50,006 --> 01:52:51,968
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just they're showing their age.

1427
01:52:55,591 --> 01:52:57,893
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, Kazurai's a real party animal.

1428
01:52:57,993 --> 01:52:59,834
[SPEAKER_02]: He's hip to what the kids are into.

1429
01:53:00,235 --> 01:53:01,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1430
01:53:01,496 --> 01:53:05,839
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his finger on the pulse of what's hot.

1431
01:53:05,859 --> 01:53:06,820
[SPEAKER_03]: What gamers really want

1432
01:53:08,579 --> 01:53:09,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1433
01:53:10,265 --> 01:53:12,533
[SPEAKER_03]: When he's not partying in his yacht.

1434
01:53:13,938 --> 01:53:18,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the Xbox for a minute and their Games on Demand service.

1435
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:22,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can buy full games through the Games on Demand service and download them to your hard drive.

1436
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:24,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, these are games that have been out for a little while.

1437
01:53:24,862 --> 01:53:28,123
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see a lot of stuff that comes out as they're new, but this is interesting.

1438
01:53:28,843 --> 01:53:35,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Cave is going to be releasing Death Smiles 2X directly to Games on Demand.

1439
01:53:35,186 --> 01:53:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: There will not be a disc release in North America.

1440
01:53:38,307 --> 01:53:39,267
[SPEAKER_02]: The game will cost $30, excuse me, $29.99.

1441
01:53:41,668 --> 01:53:42,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not translating it.

1442
01:53:42,909 --> 01:53:44,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be straight up in Japanese.

1443
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:49,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You are buying basically the import game, but playable on your Xbox 360 through Games on Demand.

1444
01:53:49,993 --> 01:53:54,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it's a shooter game, it's not like you need to have a real thorough knowledge of Japanese anyhow.

1445
01:53:54,295 --> 01:53:56,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have no knowledge of Japanese, seriously.

1446
01:53:56,516 --> 01:53:59,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to launch Tuesday, May 17th.

1447
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook is where they announced this.

1448
01:54:01,979 --> 01:54:03,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, what a sign of the times.

1449
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:10,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Cave announced this on Facebook, saying, quote, It will be giving this format a try for getting some of our Japan-only shooters released overseas.

1450
01:54:11,671 --> 01:54:12,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be honest.

1451
01:54:14,273 --> 01:54:16,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a neat idea.

1452
01:54:17,095 --> 01:54:24,179
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that really like import games and would like to be playing them, and it sucks that the Xbox is region locked the way it is.

1453
01:54:24,339 --> 01:54:25,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And import games are fucking expensive.

1454
01:54:26,101 --> 01:54:36,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So $30 for a game like that, even if they aren't doing any translations whatsoever, it's awesome because you're saving yourself probably about...

1455
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:51,583
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% of the cost of an import actually more than that probably this would actually kind of discourage some of the hacking because sometimes people hack their systems to play import games that's the reason why I hacked my original Playstation 1

1456
01:54:53,573 --> 01:54:54,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1457
01:54:56,915 --> 01:54:57,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1458
01:54:58,515 --> 01:55:00,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale, eventually.

1459
01:55:00,656 --> 01:55:00,536
$30?

1460
01:55:00,696 --> 01:55:01,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1461
01:55:02,177 --> 01:55:03,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not super good at shooters.

1462
01:55:04,438 --> 01:55:05,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you know what's interesting about this?

1463
01:55:05,778 --> 01:55:09,380
[SPEAKER_02]: By not getting a disc release, you won't be able to get it through Gamefly or anything like that.

1464
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Or rental.

1465
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:12,661
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to either pay the $30 or don't play.

1466
01:55:13,602 --> 01:55:14,882
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how well that goes over.

1467
01:55:15,723 --> 01:55:17,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

1468
01:55:18,726 --> 01:55:20,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1469
01:55:20,207 --> 01:55:29,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out a few emails that she says, hey, you guys should be writing us more emails.

1470
01:55:31,878 --> 01:55:32,178
[SPEAKER_02]: First email.

1471
01:55:35,734 --> 01:55:38,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here with a question for you all.

1472
01:55:39,277 --> 01:55:44,241
[SPEAKER_07]: After having done this radio show for a long time, do you ever get that itch to work closer to the video game industry?

1473
01:55:44,721 --> 01:55:45,382
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

1474
01:55:45,982 --> 01:55:54,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that Loki works in distribution, but do any of you feel like you would enjoy having a hand in a game's development rather than simply reporting the news and your opinions?

1475
01:55:54,629 --> 01:55:57,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you prefer to stay at arm's length and pay no mind to the man behind the curtain?

1476
01:55:58,372 --> 01:56:04,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, and I've already pitched the idea that I want to pitch an idea to Konami to...

1477
01:56:06,638 --> 01:56:32,120
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's tough actually going up to them and saying listen I want to fix your franchise because they don't really take kindly to that kind of stuff but reimagine and modernize a franchise I suppose would be the better way to do it but yeah I'd love to do that but uh at the same time you know I have a day job so it'd be kind of hard to quit a day job to go work on a game and god knows they're not going to actually listen to one person that has an idea about how they can

1478
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:43,356
[SPEAKER_03]: improve a certain franchise because I'm sure they get thousands of emails from people that do something very similar but if they were ballsy and wanted to take a chance that'd be pretty cool

1479
01:56:44,042 --> 01:56:44,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1480
01:57:08,098 --> 01:57:09,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So, OLR men and women, what are your thoughts?

1481
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:13,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you content to admire the industry from afar or do you want to dive into the trenches?

1482
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:18,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yours truly is EHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient and general grammar advocate.

1483
01:57:18,922 --> 01:57:19,182
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

1484
01:57:19,242 --> 01:57:22,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I've started a scientific poll on my Facebook to prove that everyone appreciates boobs.

1485
01:57:23,423 --> 01:57:27,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from the insignificant outliner data, the results support OLR's hypothesis.

1486
01:57:27,865 --> 01:57:31,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel free to share it in chat so that I can obtain more data and I will copy it into chat.

1487
01:57:31,726 --> 01:57:32,146
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1488
01:57:32,666 --> 01:57:46,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I actually, if certain things require a relocation on our part, I'm planning on applying with Valve, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

1489
01:57:47,337 --> 01:57:49,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what I want to do is publication.

1490
01:57:49,478 --> 01:57:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee, I wonder if she might be thinking of relocating too.

1491
01:57:54,122 --> 01:58:02,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wanting to do publication, like manuals, advertising, anything that's going to go into digital or physical print.

1492
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:06,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I'm a little torn on it.

1493
01:58:07,007 --> 01:58:08,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly have to say no.

1494
01:58:08,848 --> 01:58:11,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's a lot I could contribute on the front lines.

1495
01:58:11,489 --> 01:58:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a programmer.

1496
01:58:12,429 --> 01:58:13,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an artist.

1497
01:58:13,610 --> 01:58:16,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I have ideas about games, but you know what?

1498
01:58:16,671 --> 01:58:19,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people kind of do it a little bit better, and I'm okay with that.

1499
01:58:19,752 --> 01:58:22,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have no problem being an advisor personally.

1500
01:58:22,233 --> 01:58:22,834
[SPEAKER_02]: A tracker.

1501
01:58:22,914 --> 01:58:28,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, having done this show as long as I have, I think I could probably get away with being some type of games analyst.

1502
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:30,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I have a day job I rather enjoy.

1503
01:58:31,103 --> 01:58:32,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a decent amount of money.

1504
01:58:33,085 --> 01:58:35,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really see myself leaving it anytime soon.

1505
01:58:36,027 --> 01:58:52,332
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'm not going to lie, especially from the journalism ends of things, if I ever had the opportunity to host a show about games, especially on TV, although there's such little demand for that, I don't know how that would ever happen, I would jump at that opportunity in a heartbeat, absolutely.

1506
01:58:52,452 --> 01:58:55,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I worry I'm starting to get a little old for that.

1507
01:58:55,292 --> 01:58:56,673
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that stuff is targeted towards...

1508
01:58:57,453 --> 01:58:59,114
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 20-somethings and teens.

1509
01:58:59,254 --> 01:59:01,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm starting to enter my mid-30s.

1510
01:59:01,316 --> 01:59:04,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if I would really be wanted for that.

1511
01:59:05,098 --> 01:59:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tell you what I would love, love, love to do more than anything.

1512
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to host a game show.

1513
01:59:10,942 --> 01:59:13,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially like a throwback to the old Starrcade.

1514
01:59:13,443 --> 01:59:15,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Rob's here with Bob Barker.

1515
01:59:15,444 --> 01:59:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Even something like Nick Arcade or something like that.

1516
01:59:17,706 --> 01:59:18,646
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to be painted orange.

1517
01:59:18,666 --> 01:59:23,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Bob Barker, but I also love Gene Rayburn from old 70s match game.

1518
01:59:23,829 --> 01:59:24,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would say...

1519
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,021
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who my person is?

1520
01:59:26,841 --> 01:59:27,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude from Press Your Luck.

1521
01:59:28,403 --> 01:59:29,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Peter Tamarkin.

1522
01:59:31,885 --> 01:59:37,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would absolutely leave my day job in a heartbeat to go be a game show host.

1523
01:59:37,289 --> 01:59:44,515
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I actually had an old boss who thought she heard of some TV station casting for who wants to be a game show host.

1524
01:59:44,895 --> 01:59:54,967
[SPEAKER_02]: and she told me I could take leave from work to participate in that show and she said that it's possible to be arranged unfortunately that show didn't turn out to be legit but if they ever had something like that I'd go on it in a heartbeat absolutely

1525
01:59:56,080 --> 02:00:00,561
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know, we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio as a hobby for nine years now.

1526
02:00:01,182 --> 02:00:06,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And just radio in general, you know, I was on Understated Nation Live before that and was doing college radio before that.

1527
02:00:06,543 --> 02:00:09,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the radio industry especially is highly competitive.

1528
02:00:10,244 --> 02:00:13,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of like the fact that we get to do radio on our own terms.

1529
02:00:14,025 --> 02:00:15,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're not the biggest show out there.

1530
02:00:16,126 --> 02:00:19,167
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, even after nine years, have no idea who the fuck we are.

1531
02:00:19,487 --> 02:00:22,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody gets between me and you.

1532
02:00:22,668 --> 02:00:23,949
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1533
02:00:47,452 --> 02:00:50,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, which is why we'll probably be independent forever.

1534
02:00:50,134 --> 02:00:55,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, I think it's the way at least ye small but loyal few like it.

1535
02:00:55,897 --> 02:00:57,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we roll.

1536
02:00:58,058 --> 02:00:58,919
[SPEAKER_07]: That and we have Shermie.

1537
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll always have Shermie.

1538
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1539
02:01:04,101 --> 02:01:05,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan says we'd sell out.

1540
02:01:05,062 --> 02:01:05,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's full of crap.

1541
02:01:08,729 --> 02:01:12,790
[SPEAKER_02]: If it happened and you guys didn't take the money, I would kill all three of you

1542
02:01:34,838 --> 02:01:35,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on.

1543
02:01:35,479 --> 02:01:36,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan said that on the mic.

1544
02:01:37,081 --> 02:01:38,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he might have got picked up.

1545
02:01:40,187 --> 02:01:42,110
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband likes to just come in here and shout things.

1546
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: He said if we didn't take the money, he'd kill all of us.

1547
02:01:45,115 --> 02:01:45,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this, though.

1548
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:47,439
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely, I think...

1549
02:01:48,755 --> 02:01:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one thing we always want to make sure we do here at Orange Lounge Radio is we don't want to rest on our laurels too much.

1550
02:01:54,038 --> 02:02:00,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if there's ways we can push things forward and push ourselves more and push the hobby forward, we're going to try and do that.

1551
02:02:00,983 --> 02:02:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not saying anything, but trust me, we're always thinking about how can things be even better than they are right now.

1552
02:02:09,548 --> 02:02:10,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Better.

1553
02:02:11,429 --> 02:02:12,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But on our terms.

1554
02:02:13,251 --> 02:02:14,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important on our terms.

1555
02:02:14,431 --> 02:02:14,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1556
02:02:16,707 --> 02:02:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1557
02:02:17,888 --> 02:02:18,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1558
02:02:18,488 --> 02:02:18,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1559
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:34,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Destructoid article that's linked by... I was getting my... Originally scheduled for launch sometime this month, Nintendo has pushed back the already late release because it should have been ready when the damn system was out of the 3DS eShop until June.

1560
02:02:34,436 --> 02:02:38,038
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the company, North America will get it June 6th and Japan will get it June 7th.

1561
02:02:38,638 --> 02:02:39,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we get it first.

1562
02:02:39,558 --> 02:02:39,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Neener.

1563
02:02:40,959 --> 02:02:42,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, technically, it's sort of at the same time.

1564
02:02:43,381 --> 02:02:49,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I was emailing a friend about this, and I also mentioned the big three addresses by Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, respectively.

1565
02:02:49,947 --> 02:02:59,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I realized that the eShop will open on the day Microsoft and Sony talk, June 6th, USA, June 7th, Japan.

1566
02:02:59,215 --> 02:02:59,896
[SPEAKER_07]: How clever.

1567
02:03:00,196 --> 02:03:02,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1568
02:03:03,701 --> 02:03:04,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Last two emails.

1569
02:03:05,347 --> 02:03:07,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad they finally got it back up.

1570
02:03:07,453 --> 02:03:09,018
[SPEAKER_07]: This is called Thoughts on PSN.

1571
02:03:10,182 --> 02:03:10,924
[SPEAKER_07]: They got it up.

1572
02:03:12,165 --> 02:03:13,005
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1573
02:03:38,132 --> 02:03:42,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Patcher did a 24 plus minute video on how this will impact Sony.

1574
02:03:43,094 --> 02:03:44,234
[SPEAKER_07]: A very interesting watch.

1575
02:03:44,274 --> 02:03:48,535
[SPEAKER_07]: He certainly feels that while they lost money slash sales, they'll be fine.

1576
02:03:48,695 --> 02:03:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the link and I will copy it into the chat room.

1577
02:03:50,916 --> 02:03:58,118
[SPEAKER_07]: But for those listening, it's GameTrailers.com slash video slash episode dash 215 dash patch.

1578
02:03:59,038 --> 02:04:00,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess P-A-C-H is how it's written on there.

1579
02:04:01,259 --> 02:04:03,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Dash attack slash 713900.

1580
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:04,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're giving...

1581
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:07,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving the analyst video time now, too.

1582
02:04:07,501 --> 02:04:10,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume if you just go to GameTrailers.com and search for his name, you'll find it.

1583
02:04:10,703 --> 02:04:12,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but I... But, I mean... Ben Thoreau!

1584
02:04:14,084 --> 02:04:20,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be a hater, but how is this guy any different from the indie podcasts out there and all the speculation they do?

1585
02:04:20,347 --> 02:04:24,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I realize maybe he went to school or whatever, but... I get played by Morgan... What was it?

1586
02:04:25,309 --> 02:04:26,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Webbrush or whatever?

1587
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:28,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not trying to be a hater.

1588
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:29,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, everybody's got to make a living.

1589
02:04:29,511 --> 02:04:30,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

1590
02:04:30,071 --> 02:04:31,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't... Like, why is his...

1591
02:04:31,852 --> 02:04:35,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, the guy is wrong more times than he's right.

1592
02:04:36,876 --> 02:04:37,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1593
02:04:37,476 --> 02:04:38,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just reading the email.

1594
02:04:38,877 --> 02:04:39,458
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.

1595
02:04:39,558 --> 02:04:40,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm responding to the email.

1596
02:04:40,799 --> 02:04:41,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1597
02:04:41,159 --> 02:04:42,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to the podcast every week.

1598
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:43,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the good work.

1599
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:44,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's from Sepwin.

1600
02:04:45,268 --> 02:04:45,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this, though.

1601
02:04:45,989 --> 02:04:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I do kind of agree.

1602
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:49,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Sony is going to recover from it in the long run.

1603
02:04:50,232 --> 02:04:51,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're going to feel a lot of hurt.

1604
02:04:52,474 --> 02:04:57,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real question might be, is Sony going to find this worth it to do it all over again with PlayStation 4?

1605
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:01,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think at the end of the day, yes.

1606
02:05:02,042 --> 02:05:04,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they will recover.

1607
02:05:04,945 --> 02:05:11,410
[SPEAKER_02]: If Apple recovered from the antenna thing, if Microsoft recovered from the red ring thing, they'll come back.

1608
02:05:11,883 --> 02:05:12,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Sony.

1609
02:05:12,744 --> 02:05:17,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You know they've already got a business, they've already adjusted their business model to accommodate.

1610
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Bobby.

1611
02:05:22,753 --> 02:05:24,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that PSN is back up?

1612
02:05:25,215 --> 02:05:27,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And did you know that it still does not deliver tacos?

1613
02:05:28,077 --> 02:05:30,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sad, frown face, all caps, Bobby.

1614
02:05:32,141 --> 02:05:32,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to yell.

1615
02:05:32,841 --> 02:05:34,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That possibly is the best email ever, actually.

1616
02:05:37,301 --> 02:05:37,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very sad.

1617
02:05:38,001 --> 02:05:39,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my Caps Lock voice.

1618
02:05:39,142 --> 02:05:42,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I want tacos as part of my PlayStation Severance package.

1619
02:05:42,183 --> 02:05:42,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get on that?

1620
02:05:43,064 --> 02:05:44,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I only got four emails, Rob.

1621
02:05:44,945 --> 02:05:45,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need more emails.

1622
02:05:46,645 --> 02:05:47,946
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you didn't get tacos tonight.

1623
02:05:49,807 --> 02:05:52,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me more emails so that Rob will get me another taco.

1624
02:05:53,428 --> 02:05:57,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me emails so that DarkSakura buys me a taco.

1625
02:05:57,590 --> 02:06:01,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll buy you a taco if you buy me a taco.

1626
02:06:02,152 --> 02:06:03,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan says he's going to make tacos next week.

1627
02:06:04,173 --> 02:06:04,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1628
02:06:05,014 --> 02:06:05,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Rad.

1629
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:08,821
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're almost to the Skype line.

1630
02:06:08,881 --> 02:06:10,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just yet, but we will be there in just a moment.

1631
02:06:10,762 --> 02:06:14,383
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1632
02:06:14,403 --> 02:06:16,424
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, two more stories for you.

1633
02:06:19,826 --> 02:06:22,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of neat, though.

1634
02:06:22,587 --> 02:06:28,510
[SPEAKER_03]: As part of the Xbox indie service, it's been very unpredictable when games are going to be released on there.

1635
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:32,632
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, well, they're up for review now, so it should be out hopefully soon.

1636
02:06:33,072 --> 02:06:34,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1637
02:06:52,037 --> 02:06:53,038
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

1638
02:06:53,718 --> 02:07:00,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess such events like the Indie Games Winter Uprising will be more coordinated.

1639
02:07:03,426 --> 02:07:10,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess some of their titles were missed on that because of the release date whole thing.

1640
02:07:13,363 --> 02:07:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying also it's kind of mixed a positive feedback according to the development community.

1641
02:07:20,188 --> 02:07:27,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like the decision and saying that the chance to schedule a release helps them plan the game promotion more sensibly.

1642
02:07:28,193 --> 02:07:38,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Others noted that scheduling would likely lead to an open stampede to release on specific days like Friday and a game of chicken trying to figure out the best time.

1643
02:07:40,321 --> 02:07:40,661
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1644
02:08:00,106 --> 02:08:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we're okay right now looking at the numbers, but we were having a skippy period for a minute there.

1645
02:08:04,928 --> 02:08:08,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, moving on, but otherwise there's not a lot we can do about it.

1646
02:08:08,509 --> 02:08:10,770
[SPEAKER_02]: If the cable's not going to cooperate, then it's not going to cooperate.

1647
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:17,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So we move on with one last story here tonight before we go to the Skype line, which if we're still skipping is really going to be a hoot and a holler tonight.

1648
02:08:17,592 --> 02:08:19,093
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1649
02:08:43,090 --> 02:09:09,979
[SPEAKER_02]: uh anyhow uh they're not it's just a straight up release of the Super Nintendo version so don't expect anything fabulous to be changed that means you're not going to have the extra dungeons and stuff in the DS version but there you go uh it is coming out no price announced yet but everybody is speculating it'll be 900 Wii points 800 for a Super Nintendo game and that 100 point premium for the special of the special games which honestly Chrono Trigger it's probably worth it so uh I'm sure there'll be a lot of people checking that out

1650
02:09:10,339 --> 02:09:17,623
[SPEAKER_02]: and especially if you were too young to remember Chrono Trigger or just never got a chance to play it back in the day, you really should check it out.

1651
02:09:18,063 --> 02:09:30,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I sometimes hate on it on the show because I don't think it's the best Super Nintendo RPG because I love Final Fantasy 3 too goddamn much, or 6, whatever you want to call it, but it's really good.

1652
02:09:30,830 --> 02:09:31,591
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.

1653
02:09:31,691 --> 02:09:32,511
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to know what's great?

1654
02:09:32,691 --> 02:09:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

1655
02:09:33,972 --> 02:09:40,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Now keep in mind that I got the game in 95, 96 when it came out.

1656
02:09:40,038 --> 02:09:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, my friend loaned it to me and then he moved.

1657
02:09:43,741 --> 02:09:45,322
[SPEAKER_07]: My save file is still intact.

1658
02:09:46,623 --> 02:09:47,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

1659
02:09:47,384 --> 02:09:47,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1660
02:09:47,704 --> 02:09:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, a lot about those batteries were only ever guaranteed to last five years, but most people I know with old NES cartridges, those things still work.

1661
02:09:55,311 --> 02:09:56,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just a lithium battery.

1662
02:09:56,832 --> 02:09:58,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on how much you used it.

1663
02:09:58,254 --> 02:09:59,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, as long as you don't have the game on 24-7.

1664
02:10:01,653 --> 02:10:01,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1665
02:10:02,113 --> 02:10:03,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So, interesting.

1666
02:10:04,475 --> 02:10:07,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, our Saturn batteries, however, have burned and burned and burned and burned.

1667
02:10:07,837 --> 02:10:08,158
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1668
02:10:08,218 --> 02:10:14,302
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to now open the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1669
02:10:14,322 --> 02:10:17,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to really hope our live transmit issues don't get in the way.

1670
02:10:18,024 --> 02:10:19,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Skype... Oh, excuse me.

1671
02:10:19,565 --> 02:10:19,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Hiccups.

1672
02:10:20,786 --> 02:10:28,148
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skype line is now open for your calls if you want to give feedback on any of tonight's topics or anything else that might be on your mind.

1673
02:10:28,288 --> 02:10:29,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that, it's already ringing.

1674
02:10:29,929 --> 02:10:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We will of course also go to Loki with some last minute stories in between calls.

1675
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:34,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1676
02:10:35,491 --> 02:10:37,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one and only Ranma, how's everyone tonight?

1677
02:10:37,231 --> 02:10:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else gets in first on this show?

1678
02:10:38,872 --> 02:10:39,452
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you Ranma?

1679
02:10:40,412 --> 02:10:40,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good.

1680
02:10:40,992 --> 02:10:42,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty happy.

1681
02:10:42,293 --> 02:10:42,633
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1682
02:10:43,013 --> 02:10:43,533
[SPEAKER_02]: You're happy?

1683
02:10:43,593 --> 02:10:44,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you happy?

1684
02:10:44,713 --> 02:10:46,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I start a new job come tomorrow.

1685
02:10:46,194 --> 02:10:47,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's a reason to be happy.

1686
02:10:47,594 --> 02:10:48,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

1687
02:10:48,795 --> 02:10:49,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1688
02:10:49,335 --> 02:10:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of job are you going to be doing, if you don't mind me asking?

1689
02:10:52,536 --> 02:10:58,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll still be doing tech support in the school district, but with a different company with a lot more pay and better benefits.

1690
02:10:58,677 --> 02:11:00,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, more pay and better benefits are always a good thing.

1691
02:11:00,518 --> 02:11:00,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

1692
02:11:01,653 --> 02:11:03,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1693
02:11:22,481 --> 02:11:31,826
[SPEAKER_10]: What I see is it's probably going to be like a simple controller with a touch screen in the middle of it kind of preset for certain buttons to do certain things according to the way the game is going to be.

1694
02:11:32,626 --> 02:11:33,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually agree with that.

1695
02:11:33,566 --> 02:11:36,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like almost everything has a touch screen in this day and age.

1696
02:11:36,668 --> 02:11:38,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much every smartphone these days has one.

1697
02:11:39,569 --> 02:11:49,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was talking about earlier when we were talking about the new Nintendo console in the first place, the touch screens on the printer devices and those things.

1698
02:11:50,115 --> 02:11:50,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've seen those.

1699
02:11:52,170 --> 02:12:13,243
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah I don't think the touchscreens will be that expensive it's just you know all this other stuff too you know pretty much so what do you what are your expectations for the new Nintendo console we are only three weeks away from E3 they're saying it's going to be on par with the 360 and the PS3 just show me what it can do

1700
02:12:14,935 --> 02:12:31,882
[SPEAKER_10]: and what and the features that's it I'm a very simple person with basic needs I mean if there's gonna be some great gaming on it I will pick up the console if it's going to be the Wii second gen with more more shovelware it can stay on the shelf and collect more dust

1701
02:12:34,819 --> 02:12:36,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know the golden rule of OLR.

1702
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,120
[SPEAKER_02]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1703
02:12:38,661 --> 02:12:39,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, indeed.

1704
02:12:39,381 --> 02:12:41,061
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem with the 3DS right now, too.

1705
02:12:41,101 --> 02:12:44,563
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I left my 3DS here after the show last week and never bothered to come get it.

1706
02:12:44,583 --> 02:12:45,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, that's a lie.

1707
02:12:45,343 --> 02:12:48,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I did try to come by Monday, but nobody was here because I was in the neighborhood.

1708
02:12:49,165 --> 02:12:51,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite understandable.

1709
02:12:51,245 --> 02:12:52,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really miss it that much.

1710
02:12:53,366 --> 02:12:58,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I took mine out of my bag because I didn't like lugging it back and forth around because I'm not using it.

1711
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have no one to street pass with.

1712
02:13:00,391 --> 02:13:00,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, darn.

1713
02:13:02,092 --> 02:13:02,993
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to street pass with me.

1714
02:13:03,013 --> 02:13:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it to E3.

1715
02:13:03,513 --> 02:13:06,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Try a street pass with people there.

1716
02:13:06,435 --> 02:13:07,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to loiter outside E3?

1717
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:08,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby will street pass with me.

1718
02:13:09,797 --> 02:13:11,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to loiter outside E3 just to street pass.

1719
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:14,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to walk around with a big cardboard sign.

1720
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:15,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I should do this.

1721
02:13:15,561 --> 02:13:16,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Big cardboard sign.

1722
02:13:17,242 --> 02:13:19,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Media not good enough to get into E3.

1723
02:13:19,764 --> 02:13:20,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Please street pass with me.

1724
02:13:24,986 --> 02:13:25,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

1725
02:13:26,327 --> 02:13:26,647
Wow.

1726
02:13:27,607 --> 02:13:27,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1727
02:13:28,067 --> 02:13:29,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Ranma?

1728
02:13:30,908 --> 02:13:33,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, in regards to PAX East 2012.

1729
02:13:34,609 --> 02:13:34,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1730
02:13:36,209 --> 02:13:36,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1731
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:45,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I expect this to be announced soon, but I don't know if you know, but next year, PAX East is the same weekend as Anime Boston.

1732
02:13:46,132 --> 02:13:48,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Same city, two separate convention centers.

1733
02:13:49,013 --> 02:13:49,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1734
02:13:49,693 --> 02:13:50,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1735
02:13:52,372 --> 02:13:54,515
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be a mess.

1736
02:13:54,715 --> 02:13:56,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That is bad planning.

1737
02:13:56,517 --> 02:13:57,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1738
02:13:57,138 --> 02:13:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: That is bad planning.

1739
02:14:00,702 --> 02:14:02,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

1740
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:08,131
[SPEAKER_10]: But the problem is sometimes when the conventions have these dates, it's like take it or leave it, you know?

1741
02:14:08,192 --> 02:14:10,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's probably what it boiled down to.

1742
02:14:10,374 --> 02:14:10,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1743
02:14:12,827 --> 02:14:24,778
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing, this was announced at Anime Boston's Masquerade, and I actually talked to a few people that are staff, and that was it, that actually verified this, but it will not surprise me if this changes.

1744
02:14:25,499 --> 02:14:37,891
[SPEAKER_10]: They made the announcement that if you purchase a pass for Anime Boston 2012, it is good for entrance to PAX East 2012 as well, and they will have shuttle buses going between both convention centers.

1745
02:14:39,443 --> 02:14:44,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little weird to me considering the attendance caps that PAX keeps hitting.

1746
02:14:44,913 --> 02:14:51,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why would you want to, you know, because if everybody who goes to Anime Boston gets a free pass into PAX...

1747
02:14:52,045 --> 02:14:53,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's less people that can go to PAX.

1748
02:14:54,866 --> 02:14:58,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So that seems like, if I were on the PAX, I wouldn't agree to that.

1749
02:14:59,647 --> 02:15:00,707
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were behind that show.

1750
02:15:01,808 --> 02:15:05,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I figure it's like, you know, you got so many gamers going to this convention.

1751
02:15:05,589 --> 02:15:07,989
[SPEAKER_10]: You got so many anime fans going to this convention.

1752
02:15:08,509 --> 02:15:11,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Give them a free pass to check out the other side, per se.

1753
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:12,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then why not?

1754
02:15:12,671 --> 02:15:14,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the other half going to be true, too?

1755
02:15:15,688 --> 02:15:17,489
[SPEAKER_10]: It would not surprise me if it is.

1756
02:15:17,729 --> 02:15:22,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But correct me if I'm wrong, Anime Boston is going to be at the old convention center, the Heinz, right?

1757
02:15:23,091 --> 02:15:23,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1758
02:15:23,411 --> 02:15:27,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Uber one that PAX was at this year is where PAX will be.

1759
02:15:27,852 --> 02:15:30,413
[SPEAKER_02]: What if everybody decides to go to Anime Boston one of those days?

1760
02:15:30,473 --> 02:15:32,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that Heinz place is going to collapse.

1761
02:15:33,451 --> 02:15:41,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, with the numbers that PAX East generates, I find that hard to believe because I'm planning to do PAX East instead.

1762
02:15:41,738 --> 02:15:54,909
[SPEAKER_10]: And knowing how some fans are, how lazy they can be per se, no offense, but to be perfectly honest, I don't think a lot of them are going to take shuttle buses to go 15 minutes across town to another convention and then come back.

1763
02:15:55,109 --> 02:15:56,210
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the two needs to move.

1764
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:57,351
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

1765
02:15:57,451 --> 02:15:58,411
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the two needs to move.

1766
02:15:58,852 --> 02:16:00,113
[SPEAKER_02]: They shouldn't be the same weekend.

1767
02:16:01,016 --> 02:16:06,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but this is what I'm hearing from a lot of my sources that this could be the end for AEB.

1768
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:06,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1769
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:07,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then move.

1770
02:16:08,741 --> 02:16:09,121
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1771
02:16:10,902 --> 02:16:11,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1772
02:16:11,522 --> 02:16:13,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be tricky.

1773
02:16:13,183 --> 02:16:15,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an interesting weekend next year.

1774
02:16:16,125 --> 02:16:16,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1775
02:16:16,785 --> 02:16:19,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I am curious to see how this is all going to play out.

1776
02:16:19,447 --> 02:16:22,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a long ways away, all things considered, so some things may change.

1777
02:16:22,729 --> 02:16:23,089
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1778
02:16:24,229 --> 02:16:26,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't doubt your sources, but I'm still skeptical.

1779
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:29,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like wishful thinking on Anime Boston's part.

1780
02:16:30,413 --> 02:16:33,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it wouldn't surprise me as if, like, AB says this is what they're going to do.

1781
02:16:33,956 --> 02:16:39,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't surprise me if Paxix comes out and says, yeah, you buy one of our badges, it's not good for AB.

1782
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:47,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're trying to be all buddy-buddy, friendly-friendly, because you have two different convention companies in the same town.

1783
02:16:47,861 --> 02:16:51,344
[SPEAKER_10]: fighting for Top Dog, or in this case, a one-legged ass-kicking contest.

1784
02:16:51,684 --> 02:17:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I was going to say, you'd think in most situations the two would be fighting each other, but I'm sorry, anime fans, Pax, with the people that come as far away as they do, you know, all the way from, like, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and all, like, the southern east states, you know, because that's still the closest thing they've got.

1785
02:17:10,016 --> 02:17:10,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1786
02:17:11,237 --> 02:17:14,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Anime Boston's going to get their ass handed to them if they stay that same weekend.

1787
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:21,401
[SPEAKER_10]: and you're absolutely right but the funny thing is there are people that travel as far south as Florida and Texas that come up to Anime Boston.

1788
02:17:21,741 --> 02:17:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do they do it?

1789
02:17:22,621 --> 02:17:23,242
[SPEAKER_10]: For the guests.

1790
02:17:23,642 --> 02:17:30,164
[SPEAKER_10]: But for next year you may travel way across the country for the guests but as for me I'll travel way across the country to check out these great games.

1791
02:17:30,484 --> 02:17:30,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1792
02:17:31,344 --> 02:17:31,564
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1793
02:17:31,764 --> 02:17:31,944
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1794
02:17:32,024 --> 02:17:32,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1795
02:17:32,264 --> 02:17:34,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks so much buddy.

1796
02:17:34,825 --> 02:17:35,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey no problem dude.

1797
02:17:35,485 --> 02:17:35,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1798
02:17:35,905 --> 02:17:36,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1799
02:17:36,306 --> 02:17:37,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1800
02:17:37,466 --> 02:17:37,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1801
02:17:37,886 --> 02:17:41,607
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1802
02:17:42,627 --> 02:17:44,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki any last minute stories while we wait for a call?

1803
02:17:44,902 --> 02:17:45,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The Royal Wedding

1804
02:18:06,438 --> 02:18:10,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it will allow players to replace either Prince William or Kate Milton.

1805
02:18:11,119 --> 02:18:12,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, I can be Princess Kate?

1806
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:15,000
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be Princess Kate, yes.

1807
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:18,741
[SPEAKER_03]: In their first public kiss following the royal wedding.

1808
02:18:18,981 --> 02:18:19,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1809
02:18:19,862 --> 02:18:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It says the scene's offered free, clearly an attempt to subvert otherwise rational people.

1810
02:18:23,923 --> 02:18:25,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how I feel about that.

1811
02:18:25,243 --> 02:18:26,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to the phones.

1812
02:18:26,123 --> 02:18:27,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1813
02:18:27,044 --> 02:18:27,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1814
02:18:29,264 --> 02:18:30,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought I had a call.

1815
02:18:30,264 --> 02:18:30,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not.

1816
02:18:30,945 --> 02:18:31,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I missed it.

1817
02:18:31,525 --> 02:18:31,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1818
02:18:31,945 --> 02:18:32,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep going.

1819
02:18:33,722 --> 02:18:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, apparently there's going to be some other footage and stuff that's available.

1820
02:18:37,487 --> 02:18:39,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously though, I've played Ysar 2.

1821
02:18:40,310 --> 02:18:43,754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool concept, but it's so terribly executed.

1822
02:18:44,655 --> 02:18:46,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a terrible game.

1823
02:18:47,037 --> 02:18:50,421
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite is how the camera cannot frame you properly.

1824
02:18:51,142 --> 02:18:51,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1825
02:18:53,971 --> 02:18:58,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Deathwishing I'm playing a very amazing gem of a game that people need to start playing again Freelancer

1826
02:19:20,089 --> 02:19:38,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a PC game from 2004, I believe, and it's kind of, say, like, EVE Online, minus being an MMORPG, but you can play with, like, 200 people online at once, and you do missions, I think, like, Neverwinter Nights kind of style, you know, you can do missions and stuff, all that, but it's space combat.

1827
02:19:38,573 --> 02:19:40,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, okay.

1828
02:19:40,413 --> 02:19:41,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty fun.

1829
02:19:42,254 --> 02:19:47,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, that Nintendo thing, I'm...

1830
02:19:48,564 --> 02:19:52,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of looking, I'm totally seeing fail in the future.

1831
02:19:52,967 --> 02:19:53,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Why so negative?

1832
02:19:55,209 --> 02:20:03,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like, they're saying, oh, it's going to be like on par with PS3, Xbox 360, but then you see the thing about, oh, we're going to be inventing some new peripheral where you can like feel things.

1833
02:20:03,535 --> 02:20:05,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, great.

1834
02:20:12,427 --> 02:20:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think the feel thing is bullshit.

1835
02:20:15,748 --> 02:20:17,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly think the feel thing is bullshit.

1836
02:20:17,589 --> 02:20:22,051
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not coming from the same source that originally leaked the news about the Nintendo Wii Next system.

1837
02:20:22,071 --> 02:20:25,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That came from a different source.

1838
02:20:25,752 --> 02:20:31,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the feel stuff holds about as much weight as the fact that the revolution was going to project 3D graphics.

1839
02:20:31,294 --> 02:20:31,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

1840
02:20:33,581 --> 02:20:34,262
[SPEAKER_04]: True, true.

1841
02:20:34,282 --> 02:20:34,602
[SPEAKER_04]: True enough.

1842
02:20:34,622 --> 02:20:35,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if...

1843
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:00,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1844
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:05,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think the whole, like, touch, I think that's just, like, weird, crazy fanboy bullshit.

1845
02:21:06,301 --> 02:21:06,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly do.

1846
02:21:15,003 --> 02:21:16,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you don't frickin' Nintendo things for us.

1847
02:21:16,923 --> 02:21:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna have a button that says, give Nintendo money.

1848
02:21:19,864 --> 02:21:22,145
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's anything in there, it's gonna put money regardless.

1849
02:21:22,225 --> 02:21:22,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna sell.

1850
02:21:23,145 --> 02:21:24,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I know for a fact it will.

1851
02:21:25,915 --> 02:21:28,957
[SPEAKER_04]: They got the soccer mom market on Nintendo Wii.

1852
02:21:29,297 --> 02:21:30,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but will you buy one?

1853
02:21:30,498 --> 02:21:31,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you own a Wii?

1854
02:21:33,379 --> 02:21:34,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I owned a Wii.

1855
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:40,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it for three months and then I was like, wow, this is the most gimmicky piece of crap I've ever owned.

1856
02:21:40,503 --> 02:21:42,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave it to my cousin because I didn't want to sell it.

1857
02:21:42,504 --> 02:21:43,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gave it to some kids.

1858
02:21:44,045 --> 02:21:44,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I would use it.

1859
02:21:45,126 --> 02:21:48,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you worry you might make the same mistake with a new Nintendo system?

1860
02:21:49,868 --> 02:21:52,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I won't because I'm just going to switch to PC Master Race.

1861
02:21:52,830 --> 02:21:53,290
Ha ha ha.

1862
02:21:53,832 --> 02:21:54,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure, though?

1863
02:21:54,773 --> 02:21:58,675
[SPEAKER_02]: What could Nintendo announce on this thing that would make you be like, maybe I should get this?

1864
02:22:00,116 --> 02:22:08,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... That they're actually gonna make a new GoldenEye that isn't stupid and handle like ass, and my ship just blew up.

1865
02:22:10,001 --> 02:22:11,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, have fun in the PC Master Race.

1866
02:22:14,463 --> 02:22:14,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1867
02:22:15,364 --> 02:22:18,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DeathWishing, we'll be looking for your reactions after E3.

1868
02:22:19,846 --> 02:22:20,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, um...

1869
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun, whoever's gonna, like I was gonna pack seats or whatever, have fun with all the Japanese weeaboo's at Anime.

1870
02:22:27,405 --> 02:22:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we will.

1871
02:22:28,366 --> 02:22:28,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1872
02:22:29,347 --> 02:22:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1873
02:22:29,887 --> 02:22:30,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1874
02:22:31,749 --> 02:22:34,752
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be some great, like, crossover interviews and things like that.

1875
02:22:34,772 --> 02:22:38,055
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1876
02:22:38,696 --> 02:22:42,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I... I really think Anime Boston's gonna be forced to move weekends.

1877
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I know...

1878
02:22:44,017 --> 02:22:49,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's only so much convention center space and so on, but think outside the box, people.

1879
02:22:50,579 --> 02:22:54,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, 1-877-GAME-O-L-R or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

1880
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:56,421
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, more last minute stories from Loki.

1881
02:22:57,041 --> 02:22:59,222
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an NES cartridge that's being developed.

1882
02:22:59,802 --> 02:23:02,563
[SPEAKER_03]: That will turn your NES into a MIDI synthesizer.

1883
02:23:02,883 --> 02:23:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Chip Maestro.

1884
02:23:04,604 --> 02:23:07,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually part of a Kickstarter program.

1885
02:23:07,805 --> 02:23:10,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And for $50, you can grab one of these cartridges.

1886
02:23:10,747 --> 02:23:17,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It plugs into a MIDI keyboard, and you can start creating your own 8-bit sounding music using a keyboard.

1887
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:18,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

1888
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:28,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, of course, um, there is a new Xbox Live and PlayStation Network game that's been announced.

1889
02:23:28,766 --> 02:23:31,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Jeremy McGrath Off-Road.

1890
02:23:31,367 --> 02:23:33,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no word on what the game is exactly.

1891
02:23:33,989 --> 02:23:36,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it's gonna be a Baja Racing type game.

1892
02:23:37,151 --> 02:23:43,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually being, um, developed, I guess, uh, from the people that did Baja Edge of Control for THQ.

1893
02:23:44,576 --> 02:23:52,543
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess they've also done some work on the MX vs. ATV series so they've got a good pedigree there but don't really know that many details about it.

1894
02:23:52,683 --> 02:23:59,288
[SPEAKER_03]: People are kind of hoping that it's maybe a spiritual successor to Ivan Ironman Stewart's off-road racing game.

1895
02:23:59,429 --> 02:24:00,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was fucking awesome.

1896
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:01,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

1897
02:24:01,530 --> 02:24:03,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got another call coming in.

1898
02:24:04,273 --> 02:24:05,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1899
02:24:05,293 --> 02:24:05,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1900
02:24:05,774 --> 02:24:06,554
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already called the number.

1901
02:24:08,136 --> 02:24:09,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, it's CD Thunder.

1902
02:24:10,197 --> 02:24:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: CD Thunder, what's on your mind?

1903
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:17,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have a couple of things to talk to you about.

1904
02:24:18,503 --> 02:24:19,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

1905
02:24:21,886 --> 02:24:23,627
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be like hella lag going on here.

1906
02:24:24,187 --> 02:24:24,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1907
02:24:26,009 --> 02:24:27,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's see.

1908
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:31,273
[SPEAKER_05]: The two games I want to talk about, Perfect Dark and Gold 9007.

1909
02:24:32,855 --> 02:24:34,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Some classic games.

1910
02:24:34,856 --> 02:24:35,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

1911
02:24:37,478 --> 02:24:39,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like them both, and...

1912
02:24:40,419 --> 02:24:46,562
[SPEAKER_05]: The Perfect Dark is basically like a space version of the GoldenEye 007, if you know what I'm talking about.

1913
02:24:48,223 --> 02:24:49,343
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some old games.

1914
02:24:49,363 --> 02:24:51,684
[SPEAKER_02]: These games have been out a very long time.

1915
02:24:52,205 --> 02:24:59,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you just kind of getting around to playing classics, like rediscovering old stuff, kind of like our last callers playing some PC game from 2004?

1916
02:25:00,148 --> 02:25:01,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you rediscovering classic games?

1917
02:25:02,589 --> 02:25:10,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you finding these through the new versions of GoldenEye, Perfect Dark Zero, or what has piqued your interest in these games?

1918
02:25:11,124 --> 02:25:14,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're the guy that called in a few weeks ago and you just recently got a 64, right?

1919
02:25:29,142 --> 02:25:33,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, not recently, but a few Christmases ago or something.

1920
02:25:33,685 --> 02:25:37,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but you don't have a lot of the new systems, right?

1921
02:25:38,008 --> 02:25:38,248
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1922
02:25:39,729 --> 02:25:40,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I remember you.

1923
02:25:40,770 --> 02:25:43,912
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you've got all the classic stuff in your house.

1924
02:25:44,692 --> 02:25:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of the good stuff.

1925
02:25:47,174 --> 02:25:54,919
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gaming in a time capsule, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because there's a lot of shit out there right now, and so it really gives you time to focus on the classics.

1926
02:25:54,979 --> 02:25:58,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're kind of rediscovering a lot of these games like they're totally new, right?

1927
02:25:59,943 --> 02:26:00,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1928
02:26:00,563 --> 02:26:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool, actually.

1929
02:26:03,225 --> 02:26:08,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to be living in a bubble like that sometimes, because there's a lot of real crap out there right now.

1930
02:26:08,868 --> 02:26:12,991
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, tell us, how was it playing Perfect Dark and Goldeneye for the first time?

1931
02:26:14,172 --> 02:26:16,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Goldeneye I actually had a lot of fun with.

1932
02:26:16,613 --> 02:26:21,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the James Bond, so since it was James Bond, I really liked it a lot.

1933
02:26:23,017 --> 02:26:24,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of the levels are really difficult.

1934
02:26:25,539 --> 02:26:25,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1935
02:26:27,703 --> 02:26:33,588
[SPEAKER_05]: and with Perfect Dark it's basically... Go ahead.

1936
02:26:34,669 --> 02:26:34,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1937
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:50,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Perfect Dark is basically like a space age version of Goldmine 007 except you play as a woman and you have on-screen reloads but in Goldmine 007 you have off-screen reloads.

1938
02:26:50,383 --> 02:26:51,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bitch can't jump.

1939
02:26:53,243 --> 02:26:56,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she can jump only a little bit.

1940
02:26:56,625 --> 02:26:58,006
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they made a new GoldenEye.

1941
02:26:58,046 --> 02:26:58,606
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's funny.

1942
02:26:58,626 --> 02:27:00,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the previous callers brought this up.

1943
02:27:00,288 --> 02:27:04,570
[SPEAKER_02]: They made a new GoldenEye last year on the Wii, so you'll be playing that in about 2018.

1944
02:27:05,431 --> 02:27:08,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But they made this game, and a lot of people aren't really fans of it.

1945
02:27:09,053 --> 02:27:11,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they say it blows.

1946
02:27:11,194 --> 02:27:13,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't like the original at all.

1947
02:27:13,656 --> 02:27:16,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think people are so partial to the original GoldenEye?

1948
02:27:16,578 --> 02:27:18,159
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the charm in the original GoldenEye?

1949
02:27:20,748 --> 02:27:38,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because it could be maybe because they like the movie, and because of that they like the game, and since they remade the Goldeneye 007 on the Wii with Daniel Craig, they're thinking it's a reboot of the original, so maybe that's one of the reasons.

1950
02:27:40,626 --> 02:27:40,946
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1951
02:27:41,507 --> 02:27:44,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, buddy, we're going to let you go to take some more calls, but I'm just going to leave you with this.

1952
02:27:45,051 --> 02:27:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bother with Majora's Mask.

1953
02:27:46,532 --> 02:27:48,414
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not nearly as good as Ocarina of Time.

1954
02:27:48,495 --> 02:27:48,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know.

1955
02:27:49,696 --> 02:27:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1956
02:27:50,136 --> 02:27:50,357
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1957
02:27:50,397 --> 02:27:50,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

1958
02:27:51,498 --> 02:27:51,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1959
02:27:51,898 --> 02:27:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

1960
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:57,144
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1961
02:27:59,911 --> 02:28:02,473
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really do mean it.

1962
02:28:02,513 --> 02:28:05,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I kind of wish I could just kind of go back in gaming.

1963
02:28:05,795 --> 02:28:07,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, seriously, Super Nintendo?

1964
02:28:08,157 --> 02:28:09,418
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good games on that.

1965
02:28:09,458 --> 02:28:10,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably still have yet to play.

1966
02:28:11,519 --> 02:28:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1967
02:28:13,380 --> 02:28:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And some folks in chat room vehemently disagree with me.

1968
02:28:16,002 --> 02:28:18,884
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkToagak in chat says, Majora's Mask is orgasmic.

1969
02:28:19,124 --> 02:28:20,565
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is Sky talking about?

1970
02:28:20,725 --> 02:28:21,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Majora's Mask was annoying.

1971
02:28:22,326 --> 02:28:22,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it.

1972
02:28:23,567 --> 02:28:26,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I always thought that Ocarina of Time was a little bit overrated, too.

1973
02:28:27,229 --> 02:28:29,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Ocarina, but my favorites still link to the past.

1974
02:28:30,069 --> 02:28:32,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's wrap up with last minute stories, Loki, if you had anything else.

1975
02:28:33,192 --> 02:28:34,453
[SPEAKER_07]: His last minute story is Portal.

1976
02:28:35,293 --> 02:28:35,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I had nothing else.

1977
02:28:36,314 --> 02:28:37,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1978
02:28:38,136 --> 02:28:53,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm getting a private message about Square Enix might be going bankrupt, and I do remember reading the article online, I don't have it up in front of me, but I think they reported huge losses recently, and I assumed a lot, well, I

1979
02:28:53,628 --> 02:28:57,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of it, they were trying to say, might have been the tsunami, which makes sense.

1980
02:28:57,790 --> 02:28:59,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, everybody heard from that.

1981
02:28:59,571 --> 02:29:09,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a really large part of it that I don't think was really announced in the report was the utter, dismal, cataclysmic failure of Final Fantasy XIV.

1982
02:29:10,597 --> 02:29:15,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Because keep in mind, that game was supposed to come out on PlayStation 3 by now, but it hasn't.

1983
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:18,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think Square is probably way...

1984
02:29:19,921 --> 02:29:21,982
[SPEAKER_02]: and overestimated what they were going to make last quarter.

1985
02:29:22,002 --> 02:29:25,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of that has to do with Final Fantasy XIV, honestly.

1986
02:29:26,245 --> 02:29:27,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm getting more information.

1987
02:29:27,726 --> 02:29:29,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the person who's messaging me right now.

1988
02:29:29,868 --> 02:29:34,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me pull up this link in our little browser box here.

1989
02:29:35,131 --> 02:29:36,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and of course it's all in Japanese.

1990
02:29:36,552 --> 02:29:37,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't read that.

1991
02:29:39,414 --> 02:29:41,375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you should use Nifty.

1992
02:29:41,936 --> 02:29:43,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I could use Nifty.

1993
02:29:43,477 --> 02:29:44,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1994
02:29:44,518 --> 02:29:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could use Google Translate.

1995
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:47,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Do-do-do-do-do.

1996
02:29:48,618 --> 02:29:58,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII apparently plays into this as well, Final Fantasy XIII not quite selling as much as they thought I'm translating it now

1997
02:30:02,808 --> 02:30:26,760
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 billion yen extraordinary loss and damage the earthquake did stop them to some development they are attributing this to Final Fantasy XIV and postponing that let's see, they're thinking though they say the business environment is rapidly changing yeah, they do cite Final Fantasy XIV multiple times here

1998
02:30:28,901 --> 02:30:40,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI I guess it talks about that Final Fantasy XIV wasn't the same quality as Final Fantasy XI and they actually apologized for the unusual situation it has become.

1999
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:41,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

2000
02:30:42,151 --> 02:30:47,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we told you when we first reported on Final Fantasy XIV heads were going to roll.

2001
02:30:48,975 --> 02:30:51,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII too it sounds like might be delayed too.

2002
02:30:52,678 --> 02:30:53,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times!

2003
02:30:53,699 --> 02:30:53,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

2004
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:57,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.

2005
02:30:57,620 --> 02:30:58,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all done.

2006
02:30:58,861 --> 02:31:01,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is the part where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2007
02:31:01,881 --> 02:31:04,662
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I'm going to thank all you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2008
02:31:04,962 --> 02:31:10,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, if you like what you heard, you know, we got into this during the email bag, but we don't have big corporate dollars behind the show.

2009
02:31:11,063 --> 02:31:15,804
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this just because we like having a show, hanging out with each other, and hanging out with you guys every Sunday.

2010
02:31:16,124 --> 02:31:17,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So, tell some friends to come join the party.

2011
02:31:17,944 --> 02:31:18,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of them.

2012
02:31:18,244 --> 02:31:18,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Open invite.

2013
02:31:19,944 --> 02:31:21,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we hope to hear from your friends.

2014
02:31:21,865 --> 02:31:22,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell a couple friends about the show.

2015
02:31:24,185 --> 02:31:25,607
[SPEAKER_02]: and spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2016
02:31:26,647 --> 02:31:28,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can keep having this show for free.

2017
02:31:28,189 --> 02:31:29,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2018
02:31:29,710 --> 02:31:31,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with the portal-loving Loki.

2019
02:31:32,373 --> 02:31:34,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Your final thought tonight.

2020
02:31:34,414 --> 02:31:37,297
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is we never did FU's of the Week.

2021
02:31:37,797 --> 02:31:38,218
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we didn't.

2022
02:31:38,538 --> 02:31:39,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we didn't.

2023
02:31:40,179 --> 02:31:41,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I guess we should do that now then, shouldn't we?

2024
02:31:41,861 --> 02:31:42,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

2025
02:31:42,521 --> 02:31:42,982
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't care?

2026
02:31:43,562 --> 02:31:44,123
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we can do it.

2027
02:31:44,563 --> 02:31:45,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here they go.

2028
02:32:00,482 --> 02:32:03,344
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to this little patch of eczema on my right hand ring finger.

2029
02:32:03,704 --> 02:32:03,984
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

2030
02:32:05,665 --> 02:32:05,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

2031
02:32:06,305 --> 02:32:09,427
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the woman that wasn't watching where she was driving and hit the back of my car.

2032
02:32:09,967 --> 02:32:11,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't!

2033
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:13,369
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to hangovers.

2034
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:15,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bad one this morning.

2035
02:32:16,311 --> 02:32:17,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go, Loki.

2036
02:32:17,131 --> 02:32:17,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the F yous of the week.

2037
02:32:19,132 --> 02:32:26,796
[SPEAKER_02]: My F you of the week, or not my F you, my final thought is weekend's already over and that makes me sad.

2038
02:32:29,178 --> 02:32:29,558
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

2039
02:32:30,495 --> 02:32:32,459
[SPEAKER_07]: He who controls the spice controls the universe.

2040
02:32:34,743 --> 02:32:35,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that does it everybody.

2041
02:32:36,005 --> 02:32:37,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2042
02:32:37,969 --> 02:32:39,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we do it all again next week.

2043
02:32:39,913 --> 02:32:40,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound good?

2044
02:32:40,995 --> 02:32:42,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good night everybody.

2045
02:32:42,377 --> 02:32:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week.

2046
02:32:43,928 --> 02:32:46,708
