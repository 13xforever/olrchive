00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:19,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May 22, 2011, some PSP games are rumored to be remade for the PlayStation 3.

2
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,452
[SPEAKER_02]: An anticipated 3DS title is delayed, and will Nintendo's new home console be equipped with a camera?

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:41,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice and this is episode number 414 for May the 22nd of 2011.

5
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:43,344
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:46,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts.

7
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:49,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

9
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:49,987
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

10
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:50,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Yo.

11
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:51,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

12
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:52,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Ho.

13
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:52,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

14
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you got drunk last night.

15
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:56,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan coming to say hi on the show?

16
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:28,943
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's currently just... Alright, well I have to introduce the other host that's here that's not Dan.

17
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:31,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster, Loki!

18
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:32,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm definitely not Dan.

19
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:33,464
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you, Loki?

20
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:34,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

21
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:36,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good, Loki.

22
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:38,246
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new with you?

23
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:40,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

24
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sitting at home.

25
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:43,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You're boring.

26
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:47,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I started some projects.

27
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, more projects.

28
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ponding projects.

29
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:55,051
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I started my three foot tall paper craft statue of the portal turret.

30
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:56,771
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

31
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep forgetting you're building your own portal turret.

32
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:00,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of cracks me up.

33
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:01,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

34
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:03,153
[SPEAKER_13]: I want one.

35
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:18,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as soon as I get the design correct, because right now, unfortunately, the 3D model I ported over using Peppercura had a lot of internal stuff, because it was actually a full 3D model with the actual guns and stuff.

36
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:21,290
[SPEAKER_03]: This turret's not going to have the doors open with the guns showing.

37
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:32,298
[SPEAKER_03]: But it still tried to create papercraft pieces for all that stuff that you're never going to see, so I had to filter out the stuff that I didn't need.

38
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:33,719
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:01,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some World of Warcraft and slept in And then I went to a very gay Jewish party

40
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:27,517
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, can I say fuck that Rapture guy?

41
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:35,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, fuck him in the ear, and fuck CNN, and fuck MSNBC, and all these websites that give him attention, and, like, make people want to tweet about it and all that stuff.

42
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I'm no better.

43
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I made my fair share of Rapture jokes, but I'm not talking about, like, snarky Facebook posts, because that's what websites like that are for.

44
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,643
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, you know, there's real news going on in the world.

45
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:45,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

46
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:59,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I realize this is a video game podcast, but I'm on my soapbox I made a funny picture It just astounds me that some asshole can come out and say No, really guys, it's gonna end May 21st, so sell your shit I'm totally surreal For real, for real, real

47
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm going to just say the world's going to end on Christmas.

48
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be really fucking ironic.

49
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,979
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to all die on Christmas.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,761
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

51
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:15,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Now listen to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to hear more of the gospel.

52
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:20,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it allegedly supposed to end December 2012 because of the Mayan calendar?

53
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always supposed to fucking end.

54
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, on top of that, too, this is...

55
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Me getting into a little bit of technical history.

56
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:33,804
[SPEAKER_13]: If I am right, the Mayans used a lunar calendar, meaning that their months are on a different basis than it would be on the Gregorian calendar.

57
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Because right now, it's like halfway through the Jewish year.

58
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:42,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm sure no one would jump to conclusions in saying that the world's going to end on a specific date.

59
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,201
[SPEAKER_03]: They obviously have some scientific fact to back that up.

60
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what are we, savages?

61
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:57,270
[SPEAKER_03]: No one just goes out spouting random garbage like the world's going to end yesterday and it doesn't happen without any sort of...

62
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Proof.

63
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,511
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just the irony to me is that they can't find the dude.

64
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Camping was named Harold Camping.

65
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:10,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And that the family radio, the site that he's like the president of, is down.

66
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:14,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So I posted in the chat room the picture that I made about the URL being raptured.

67
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:16,279
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

68
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,498
[SPEAKER_13]: You're my crack dealer now.

69
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, by the way, I need you to look at my setup later.

70
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:37,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I will.

71
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I played some World of Warcraft.

72
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:41,664
[SPEAKER_13]: I put Rebecca Black on hold.

73
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:46,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am now playing Bladwyn, who is a shammy, who I'm kicking butt with.

74
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:47,909
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

75
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,637
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days I'm going to actually read a comic book and then be all like, I should be on Comic Insanity.

76
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:19,721
[SPEAKER_13]: I did that on Comic Insanity this morning too because Shadow was talking about Final Fantasy IX and he and Tiara were like, oh, Final Fantasy IX.

77
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, I don't play it.

78
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I got up and got some coffee.

79
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,123
[SPEAKER_15]: DoorPrize

80
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:40,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

81
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:11,239
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're in the top office, you go in behind a file cabinet is a door that leads you to three more vitrified doors and then where the Borealis dock is.

82
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:18,301
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll get the door prize thing for listening to Cave Johnson rant like a madman and then finding the remnants of the Borealis.

83
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:21,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I did that.

84
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:28,083
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one I'm doing is Smash TV where you have to break all the 11 monitors that Wheatley's jabbering at you at.

85
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:29,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those are pretty hard.

86
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:34,406
[SPEAKER_13]: The key to doing the Wheatley ones is lasers.

87
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know that, but I'm just saying some of the ones that had no lasers.

88
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,211
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've got to go back and get the turret symphony.

89
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:42,292
[SPEAKER_13]: The turrets practicing singing.

90
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

91
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that one.

92
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:49,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also need to get secret transmission, which actually, there's two secret transmissions in Portal 2, I found out.

93
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:50,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

94
00:07:51,557 --> 00:08:04,178
[SPEAKER_13]: and everybody listen up when you're doing the aerial faith plate test the big one with all the room full of faith plates and GLaDOS shoots garbage at you you take

95
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:06,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

96
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:47,810
[SPEAKER_13]: but you also go back and when you launch into the one that's on the ramp but your other portal is going to be on this thing across from the part jutting out and it busts you through a window and you find another Ratman Den and if you've got the radio with you it will play a modem sound and what that does is it actually translates into an image if you've got a decoder.

97
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

98
00:08:49,871 --> 00:09:00,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, you know, they had the whole ARG thing going on, the alternate reality game, that was basically connecting to a BBS with an old 33K modem or something.

99
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:00,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

100
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,436
[SPEAKER_13]: And all these images and stuff would go through.

101
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:05,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss BBSs.

102
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:11,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a BBS for Orange Lounge Radio where I can play Trade Wars 2002 all over again.

103
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:21,271
[SPEAKER_13]: The other one is when you're in the lower labs and you're playing in commentary mode, you'll find a developer commentary that's nothing but modem noise and it's a picture too.

104
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, it's not a picture.

105
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,494
[SPEAKER_13]: It's them talking about part of the development of Portal 2.

106
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:29,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, this is important.

107
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerds in chat, I need to know.

108
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:36,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you still download Telguard and stuff and set it up to run off of Telnet or whatever?

109
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:37,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

110
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:37,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that possible?

111
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we need to make that happen.

112
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:40,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably.

113
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:46,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, come on, there's so many retro gamers out there that I bet there's still a gemstone server running somewhere.

114
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, I haven't played that in forever.

115
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,874
[SPEAKER_03]: The third achievement is by picking up the broken turret that gets launched in there.

116
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:52,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, turret dactyl.

117
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:57,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, if you launch a turret with an aerial faith plate, you get an achievement for it.

118
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:58,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that I've done.

119
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I did that.

120
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't do that one either.

121
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,963
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to do more co-op.

122
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:02,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played enough.

123
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,907
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll play co-op with you, but I'll probably end up throwing up all over Shermie.

124
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:07,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, he's a cat.

125
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I watch the Human Vault section, so.

126
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:15,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf in the chatroom says, yes, and there are lots of Telnet BBSs out there.

127
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,490
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, I want an OLR1.

128
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, really bad.

129
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:20,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on, you guys.

130
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody in the chatroom, do it.

131
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:23,072
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'll do it.

132
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:24,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob will do it, okay.

133
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it, because I want to be the sysop.

134
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:26,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

135
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:32,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I always wanted my own BBS when I was a kid, but my mom wouldn't let me get a second phone line.

136
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,485
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's set up the OLRBBS.

137
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want an OLRBBS.

138
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:37,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

139
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:37,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make that happen.

140
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

141
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:39,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

142
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like two different conversations going on here.

143
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:49,956
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them very modern with Portal 2 and the other one not so modern with BBSs and Telnet and The Pit and Trade Wars.

144
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:51,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually... Legend of the Red Dragon.

145
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:58,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually did try to play some of the DAC, but my computer farted on me while I was trying to play the Star Trek.

146
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And I tried playing Darwinia.

147
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,003
[SPEAKER_13]: That game's confusing.

148
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:04,925
[SPEAKER_13]: And it gives me a bit of a headache.

149
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:10,148
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm gonna have to probably take a whole bunch of Midol and try playing it again.

150
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Because no, it really does give me a headache.

151
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,991
[SPEAKER_13]: The modeling in it, and the colors, makes my head hurt.

152
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:19,133
[SPEAKER_13]: So, sadness.

153
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:19,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Sadness.

154
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,970
[SPEAKER_13]: No, stuff like that's always done it to me.

155
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,871
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I played Buy Shermie Cat Food the game.

156
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:30,532
[SPEAKER_13]: The end.

157
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:36,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could say that I played exciting stuff, but I haven't.

158
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just played Grand Theft Auto.

159
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And a brief bit of Portal, because I was trying to test something on my graphics card.

160
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:47,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for some reason in Grand Theft Auto on my PC, it decided, hey, you know what, I'm going to run really slow now.

161
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:48,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what?

162
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:53,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you running slow when you're running perfectly fine just, you know, all the other days?

163
00:11:53,878 --> 00:12:04,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ended up that I was trying to overclock my laptop's graphics card, and I think the program running in the background slowed things down, actually.

164
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:11,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I did a cooling mod on this thing, so I actually have the fans kicked up, and there's a big old intake vent in the back now.

165
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:16,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I normally have, like, a cooling pad that go on the bottom of this, but I don't have it with me right now.

166
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:23,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's running much cooler, and so now I can actually overclock the GPU when I get a chance.

167
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:25,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really bothered to make it stable yet.

168
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:34,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but I will be playing later on tonight, once I get done moving some stuff around.

169
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:43,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a leaked copy of the Duke Nukem Forever demo that I will be checking out, because Duke Nukem Forever is awesome, and the fact that I can play a part of it

170
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize it already had leaked.

171
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, they have an internal demo that's really, really buggy.

172
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:54,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the real one's out, what, June 3rd or something like that?

173
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:54,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

174
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:56,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

175
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:57,912
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

176
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:20,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not new.

177
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:23,160
[SPEAKER_04]: This game's like two years old, and I'm just now getting around to it.

178
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame Collection I played this week on Xbox 360.

179
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:36,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had this game on the Wii a few years ago, and there was like a year difference between the releases.

180
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,488
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them came out in 08, I think, and the other one came out in 09.

181
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played the newer one, the 360 one, which was also released on PS3.

182
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's old pinball games, and they're classic tables.

183
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:48,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Redone for the 360

184
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:08,958
[SPEAKER_13]: We had one in my garage.

185
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,159
[SPEAKER_04]: The old school Black Knight, Pinbot.

186
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:14,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows Pinbot because they had an NES game of Pinbot so you can play the authentic table.

187
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinbot's actually kind of a crappy table.

188
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a cheap ass table.

189
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:18,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Bride of Pinbot is great.

190
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:21,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Bride of Pinbot but that sadly is not in this compilation.

191
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither is Theater of Magic.

192
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:26,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually Jackbot is the best of the bot ones.

193
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:28,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, no, not in the collection either.

194
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some other interesting tables.

195
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about 12 tables in all.

196
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:35,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly the

197
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I sound quiet?

198
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't sound quiet?

199
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:40,201
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

200
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in chat says I sound fine.

201
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, live radio, the joys of that.

202
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:48,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I'll turn myself up just a wee bit.

203
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

204
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Other things about the compilation.

205
00:14:52,889 --> 00:15:03,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of weird because some of the games are free, and then some of them will cost you credits, which is odd to me, that you just don't get everything for free at the start, but I guess it wants to give you something to work towards.

206
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:09,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the important stuff, the translation itself, you know, it works.

207
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:09,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.

208
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:22,130
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit pricey probably, you know, considering it's, I think it was about 40 bucks when it came out, you know, just for 12 tables when you got Pinball FX that offers, you know, some pretty competitive tables at a good price.

209
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,093
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that the game's kind of old, you can probably find it really cheap.

210
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:29,797
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are a pinball fan, you should probably pick it up because it's a good compilation of games.

211
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:44,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, continuing to play some of the games I talked about last week, like Might and Magic, Order of Chaos, or whatever it's called, the puzzle game on 360, and some other stuff, like Mortal Kombat, which I've had very mixed success playing it online.

212
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:53,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's very laggy, sometimes it's pretty smooth, but every time I lose horrifically, because I'm really bad at Mortal Kombat, and that makes me sad.

213
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,351
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

214
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to be here with the show next week.

215
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:20,129
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to take the week off because of Memorial Day.

216
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm actually going to be out of town on top of that.

217
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So sadly, we will not be here next week, Memorial Day.

218
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:26,712
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hating you right now, Rob.

219
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:27,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

220
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:28,472
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm being hateful and judgmental.

221
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I will make it up to you in three weeks.

222
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:31,293
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

223
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: In three weeks, it's going to be more awesomer.

224
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:37,656
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to find 50 bucks to get a Duffy.

225
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be going to the happiest place on earth twice within a month's span.

226
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,117
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just the way it works.

227
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:43,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Hateful, jealous, judgmental.

228
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:44,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, deal with it.

229
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:46,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, Hearts

230
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:25,964
[SPEAKER_04]: so we're hoping we can kind of get some reports from him and interject that with our own sassy commentary and the rest of your voices on the internet through Twitter and so forth so we're looking at doing some type of E3 specials we're not sure exactly what time yet but that will happen the week of E3 I've already been limbering my eyes up

231
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:32,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can roll them like nothing else when I see the Nintendo press conference.

232
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,993
[SPEAKER_13]: He's gonna roll it like a Katamari.

233
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be like, oh god, seriously?

234
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,737
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your great idea?

235
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I have low expectations for Nintendo.

236
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if they can limbo under that.

237
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we'll see.

238
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:50,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really hoping we can get Loki to come to the show whenever Nintendo's press conference.

239
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:53,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Ideally, well you'll have to work whenever.

240
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:54,464
[SPEAKER_04]: When is the Nintendo press conference?

241
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:55,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's during the day.

242
00:17:55,964 --> 00:18:00,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I technically don't work when those are going on because I'll stop what I'm doing and watch it.

243
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to get your immediate reaction to those press conferences.

244
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:05,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll be on Twitter.

245
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:08,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what the fuck is that?

246
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:09,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

247
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your great idea?

248
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:12,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.

249
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:17,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do some type of like where we are commenting on the press conferences as they're going on.

250
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can like download it later on.

251
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:20,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a Rift Tracks type of thing.

252
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:21,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

253
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

254
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

255
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:31,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's technically possible because they do syndicate that stuff later on so that you can rewatch the actual videos and stuff.

256
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could do that.

257
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, too much effort.

258
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:36,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

259
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:38,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that.

260
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:41,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we will not be here next week on Memorial Day weekend, sadly.

261
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back the week after, though, which happens to be the Sunday before E3.

262
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when the news is really going to start to roll in.

263
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,213
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I think we're going to get to a story on this later.

264
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:54,615
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the developers is doing their press conference Sunday night.

265
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,197
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of getting a jump on everybody else.

266
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's going to be very interesting.

267
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the news will start flooding in in two weeks.

268
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I might actually do a little bit of commentary on my Tumblr as well.

269
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,084
[SPEAKER_03]: All across the internets.

270
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:07,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, why not?

271
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:11,246
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking to have one million viewers.

272
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

273
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

274
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:21,212
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a lot going on in the gaming world ramping up to E3 this week.

275
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go to Loki who's going to start us off tonight.

276
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:28,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Sony announced their titles that are going to be a part of the Welcome Back program.

277
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:37,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the Welcome Back program includes a free 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus for all PlayStation Network users.

278
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:43,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're going to be giving out a 30-day trial to Curiosity, I guess.

279
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:47,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Her Curiosity, whatever.

280
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm calling it Curiosity.

281
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:58,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, apparently, two free PlayStation games and two free PlayStation Portable games.

282
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:07,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the free PlayStation 3 games that are available for North America, because it's a little bit different in each region...

283
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:14,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Nation, Infamous, LittleBigPlanet, SuperStardustHD, and WipeoutHD plus Fury.

284
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I already own two of those, so that's going to narrow down my choices of what I'm going to get.

285
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:20,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

286
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Same here.

287
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:30,401
[SPEAKER_03]: For PSP owners, I guess, you'll be able to get LittleBigPlanet on PSP, Mod Nation Racers, Pursuit Force, or Killzone Liberation.

288
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:53,556
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course they're going to have a selection of On Us movie rentals through the PlayStation Network and I guess existing PlayStation Plus subscribers will receive an additional 60 days of free subscription and existing Music Unlimited Premium Trial subscription members will receive an additional 30 days of free music as well and also an additional 30 days

289
00:20:54,817 --> 00:21:00,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus time lost for existing members of the Music Unlimited Premium Basic Subscription fee free of charge.

290
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:08,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And in home, of course, they're going to have 100 free items in home.

291
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Can one of those items be useful clubhouses?

292
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:12,797
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

293
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

294
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:19,498
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe, they're going to be doing some slightly different titles.

295
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:28,850
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have Ratchet & Clank, Quest for Booty, Wipeout HD, Fury, Dead Nation, Infamous, and LittleBigPlanet.

296
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, on PSP... Actually, the titles are the same on PSP.

297
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it can be slightly different for each region.

298
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Which begs the question, since PlayStation Network accounts are free to create, I had three of them.

299
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:49,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I get six games because I had three accounts created.

300
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:54,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there going to be a thing where maybe you have to have used a credit card in a transaction or something?

301
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:55,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

302
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:56,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

303
00:21:56,396 --> 00:22:06,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Because technically, I mean, I could download some free download content or something like that and never had to buy anything, but I'm still out of, you know, the three, four weeks or whatever it was down.

304
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:09,279
[SPEAKER_04]: What if I share a PlayStation with somebody else?

305
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, my significant other lives with me and we share an account.

306
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sorry, we don't share an account.

307
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We share a PlayStation, but we have two separate accounts.

308
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So will I get to get two and he'll get to get the other two?

309
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:18,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm thinking.

310
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:19,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice!

311
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:21,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's what I'm thinking

312
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:24,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could be wrong.

313
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, let me put it this way.

314
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:36,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have LittleBigPlanet already, and I would never... I wouldn't want to download it, because I have my really rare LittleBigPlanet with the band music in there.

315
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,151
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'd probably pick up Infamous, because that looked pretty good.

316
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:45,632
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of the PlayStation Network games, I just don't really care too much about those.

317
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:51,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe... I don't know, Dead Nation looked alright, or Wipeout...

318
00:22:53,430 --> 00:23:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't care, but if I can pick six titles then I'll probably get everything and then we'll see what Japan has whenever they get around to come back up.

319
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,007
[SPEAKER_03]: See, some other fun stuff Sony related.

320
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:26,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation Network, they had opened up their website for changing your password, and apparently the sign-ins, they've disabled them because they found a potential exploit that people could use to basically hack your account.

321
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:27,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

322
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:29,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

323
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now keep reading.

324
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:04,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess it allowed people to go some roundabout way to change their password and get access to their account.

325
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

326
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:15,878
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very minor and it got fixed pretty quick, but it's just you can't keep making these mistakes.

327
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:17,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You really got to be on your toes.

328
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:18,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

329
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this comment in our chat room from Islander.

330
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, OLR, a lot of people...

331
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:26,341
[SPEAKER_04]: on home right now.

332
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:29,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's like I3 Linder, but I'm saying... Blender?

333
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:32,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a little B. Okay, Blender.

334
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:38,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Blender says, by the way, OLR, a lot of people on home right now are having freezing issues when they get a new item.

335
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:40,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sort of bug since the relaunch.

336
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So, home is freezing whenever you get a new item.

337
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Hacked and people have started stealing virtual currency.

338
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I guess, some Sony run internet service provider called Sonet.

339
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:20,855
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some virtual points or whatever and people apparently stole roughly 100,000 yen or $1,200 worth of virtual points.

340
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:30,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says no personal information was compromised or any other accounts.

341
00:25:30,588 --> 00:25:34,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's still kind of pathetic that you're having multiple accounts assigned.

342
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:44,614
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, there's another story that I don't even think was on here where they had another account, another website that got hacked and became a phishing account now, a phishing website.

343
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:50,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So, man, Sony is just the Internet's bitch right now.

344
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:51,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

345
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:52,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sad.

346
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:54,499
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:15,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Japanese government refuses to let Sony relaunch the PlayStation Network there.

348
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,991
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't given approval for it.

349
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, apparently, the Ministry of Economy, Content Industry says the government refused Sony's initiative to...

350
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,598
[SPEAKER_03]: to launch the platform again.

351
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:40,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It says as of May 13th, Sony was incomplete in exercising measures that they said they will do on the May 1st press conference.

352
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:44,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It says the details of which the measures haven't been enacted yet were not released.

353
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:51,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The source added that the government wants clear terms of what Sony is planning on doing to protect its users.

354
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:57,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Credit card info saying there were similar cases in the past that were caused by other firms and we're asking Sony

355
00:26:57,695 --> 00:27:02,598
[SPEAKER_03]: whether their measures are good enough when compared to countermeasures taken in the past.

356
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that sounds fair enough.

357
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a big deal.

358
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:13,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the country's basically saying, no, you're not coming back up because you're not proven that you're secure.

359
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:19,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we keep hearing all these stories about other facets of the company getting hacked, it's kind of not helping their case.

360
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:20,470
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

361
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:25,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know why the Roman Empire fell?

362
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:26,714
[SPEAKER_13]: The Roman Empire?

363
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:30,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Dreamcast 2 Overlooked

364
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:54,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to some more hopeful news.

365
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:57,248
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not all the news that comes out of Sony these days is bad.

366
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And this could be possibly giving us a sign of some things that we could look forward to at E3.

367
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:09,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gotta say, man, Sony... Sony is gonna have... I mean, I realize Nintendo has just announced that they're showing a new fucking console at E3.

368
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,681
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am still most interested in Sony's prefs conference.

369
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:13,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I really am.

370
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:14,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's either gonna be...

371
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:20,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest, like, redemption ever, or it's gonna be just the nail in the coffin.

372
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there is so much writing on Sony's press conference this year, I can't even, like...

373
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:26,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine.

374
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really curious to see what their thing looks like.

375
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:33,977
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be one of the things that they're going to announce at the press conference at E3 this year.

376
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:42,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there's a God of War portable collection that is going to be coming out to the PlayStation 3 in Asian regions in July.

377
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:48,989
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a press release that was sent by Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan and picked up by International Gaming News websites.

378
00:28:50,210 --> 00:29:16,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the God of War PSP games Chains of Olympus and Ghosts of Sparta are going to be revamped HD Chinese and English language options and will be released on July 7th in Asia And of course a lot of people kind of their minds go well if it's coming out in Asia why the heck isn't it coming out in the rest of the world So this could be something that's being announced In fact And I mean if it's going to be in England or you know if it's coming out in Asia you can import it even if it wasn't coming out right away

379
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:17,230
[SPEAKER_04]: God of War 3

380
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:54,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony, in fact, unveiled a new initiative this week where certain PlayStation Portable titles will be ported to the PlayStation 3 with improvements made that are, you know, like exactly what we're hearing about the God of War collection.

381
00:29:54,322 --> 00:29:59,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in my mind, this confirms the God of War thing because, duh, of course they're going to do the God of War game.

382
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,029
[SPEAKER_03]: They already showed off.

383
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster Hunter Portable 3

384
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:33,190
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, what other games might be included as part of this?

385
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,573
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the other, like, huge PlayStation Portable titles that could be a part of this?

386
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throwing it out there, maybe Metal Gear Acid?

387
00:30:42,636 --> 00:30:43,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they would do Acid.

388
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they would do the last Metal Gear Solid.

389
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:46,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the last one.

390
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:47,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

391
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:47,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace Walker.

392
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Peace Walker could be one, certainly.

393
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:57,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'd learn about that pretty quick if that was going to be the case, because Konami would probably announce it during their press conference, which would be the Sunday prior.

394
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certainly looking forward to the... Unless they're told not to say that.

395
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:06,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certainly hoping that those Final Fantasy remakes would be a part of it, although I doubt it.

396
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:25,237
[SPEAKER_04]: uh that would nah plus I'd be a little bit irritated because I already bought those I would see that maybe uh you know Dissida or um you know oh yeah that I bet that's that's a big one or the other Final Fantasy game the seven spin-off Crisis Core thank you yeah yeah

397
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:28,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are definite contenders from Squeenix, absolutely.

398
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And who's to say they couldn't just do some of these as download games?

399
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, why not?

400
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would make sense to me.

401
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:35,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

402
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:39,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the Half Minute Hero games as well.

403
00:31:39,646 --> 00:31:40,167
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.

404
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:47,672
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all but certain to show up at E3, so it's just a matter of what titles and when.

405
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:49,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens with that.

406
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:59,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's great about it, though, is like some of those games, you know, that were kind of, they're just all right, you know, with control-wise because they didn't have a second analog.

407
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we can fix that.

408
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:01,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

409
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:06,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that little nub thing that the PSP has kind of starts to wear on your finger.

410
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:06,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I the only one?

411
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:09,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't use that thing for a long period of time because it hurts.

412
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the texture on that button is yuck.

413
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:13,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

414
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:17,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had a replacement so I could, you know, put on there.

415
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,294
[SPEAKER_03]: But I never had a problem with it.

416
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:21,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I guess it's just me.

417
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:23,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

418
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:25,393
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some Mortal Kombat news out there.

419
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:37,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, with the PlayStation 3, you had the Kombat Pass so that you could... You'd have to have it to play online, but you can only, of course, use it while the PlayStation Store is online, which, of course, it wasn't.

420
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:43,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's being waived until everything is pretty much back up full-time.

421
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:53,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't even really think about that until I had heard about this story because I cashed in my pass because I bought the game the day it came out or I had Amazon deliver it the day it came out.

422
00:32:53,877 --> 00:32:57,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So I cashed in my pass that day and the next day is when PlayStation went down.

423
00:32:57,938 --> 00:32:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never had a problem.

424
00:32:58,899 --> 00:32:59,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to play online.

425
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:04,800
[SPEAKER_04]: But it didn't occur to me that, oh yeah, with the store being down, you can't redeem those passes.

426
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you didn't get this game on launch day, you were screwed.

427
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:14,324
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're actually waiving the need for the pass until the PlayStation Store is fully operational.

428
00:33:14,504 --> 00:33:26,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And good, that's the right thing to do, but I don't feel sorry for them for the amount of shit they probably got from their fanbase and threatens of lawsuits and so forth, because that's what you get for putting these passes in the game in the first place.

429
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It really doesn't just end with Mortal Kombat.

430
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,030
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a growing trend.

431
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Capcom, Capcom, Capcom, Capcom.

432
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,453
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, you know, here's the thing.

433
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom isn't doing that at all.

434
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're doing that with their download content.

435
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:38,596
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it with their DRM.

436
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:46,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their DRM with their download content sucks, but they're not one of these companies putting out this, oh, we've got to buy it new in order to play online for free.

437
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,242
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's kind of bullshit.

438
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:54,206
[SPEAKER_03]: THQ, THQ, THQ, and now Warner Brothers is kind of following suit with EA.

439
00:33:54,606 --> 00:33:56,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are your evil three right there.

440
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:57,788
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

441
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:42,229
[SPEAKER_03]: since the Super Nintendo days to be quite honest honestly I think if what's gonna happen here the whole reason they're doing those online passes anyways is trying to recoup some money they're losing from piracy because if you want to play it online you gotta pay the $10 which some people have no problem doing especially if they've pirated the game but I don't know I still think it's dumb

442
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and it's especially dumb that when I am supporting the company and I buy it new that I get locked out.

443
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:50,676
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

444
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:55,178
[SPEAKER_13]: They realized they probably had to set everything up before they could announce it.

445
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but there were certainly a few days there where they probably got a lot of shit from people.

446
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying they deserved it.

447
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:06,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Even still though, someone bought that copy at one time, so they already made their sale for it.

448
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:08,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they need more money after the fact?

449
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Because someone else decides to play.

450
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:13,732
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be like, oh hey Rob, I watched this DVD once and I'm going to loan it to you.

451
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Should the company get money for that?

452
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,536
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because they already bought it once.

453
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:19,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They already got the money made from that.

454
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:23,241
[SPEAKER_03]: If they wanted a pay-per-view service or something like that, then they should do something different.

455
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:33,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com TigerClaw in our chat says, Not only that, anyone who bought a game that comes with a code for some DLC in the box, they can't redeem it until the store goes back up.

456
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:44,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like, funny enough, although I redeemed the combat pass, I did not redeem my reptile original outfit that I got for buying the game, but I don't, you know, I'm a little, it's a stupid costume.

457
00:35:44,953 --> 00:35:50,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not, the Barbie features, I'm not so bent out of shape about, you know, it doesn't really impact the game.

458
00:35:51,957 --> 00:36:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: but I mean it's certainly still a valid point maybe some other games had DLC that were impacted by this so there you go Frisbee in our chat room flat out says DRM is a poison it's such a bummer because I get why companies have to do it I mean obviously piracy is an issue and it is something that has to be dealt with but it just sucks when the people that get affected most by the change is the ones that are trying to do everything legitimately

459
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

460
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:24,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It never ends.

461
00:36:25,274 --> 00:36:25,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

462
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:26,495
[SPEAKER_03]: New story, Loki.

463
00:36:53,311 --> 00:37:20,957
[SPEAKER_03]: hmm could possibly maybe I don't know adding DS or DSi download games to the virtual console or whatever they're going to call that because now you'll have your touch screen and your one screen in your controller and your other screen is up on TV but then of course I have to say is why would you spend more money on a controller which I'm assuming is going to be at least a hundred bucks you know when you can buy DS or DSi

464
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm black

465
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:23,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

466
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:30,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I heard about this, I was thinking more of the Kinect-style features, but I guess that doesn't work if it's on a controller, does it?

467
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:32,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really think that one through.

468
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:32,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

469
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:41,642
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like this console is going to have gimmicks out the ass.

470
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:45,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what possible gimmicks can we throw in on this thing?

471
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:51,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got motion controls, it's got a touchscreen, it's got a camera on it, it's got, you know...

472
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Microwave, I mean, what else can we throw on this fucking... I just have to see how they're going to use it because I'm going to tell you this much.

473
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,692
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Nintendo gimmicks that have been out there haven't been that great.

474
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the motion control stuff, yeah.

475
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:15,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you get all these launch games that are all these just waggle this, waggle this when it could have been just a button for all that.

476
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:24,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, just the Zapper or the Wii Fit balance board or Motion Plus.

477
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:28,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of it is just rehash, you know, or...

478
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:33,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a gimmicky game that's not really that original.

479
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all this extra crap that you don't really need in there.

480
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:41,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they're throwing in all these gimmicks, they gotta be doing something really smart with it.

481
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:48,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the problem why it seems like there's so many gimmicks as well is because we're in that rumor phase where people are just fucking making shit up.

482
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not even sure I totally agree with this rumor.

483
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:55,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just somebody making a good odds prediction.

484
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:57,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

485
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,420
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

486
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the stuff they promise will not make it at launch or at all.

487
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:47,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're going to promise you all this stuff that this console is going to be doing.

488
00:39:48,382 --> 00:39:49,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that feature is not done yet.

489
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:52,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be out for six months after the console is released.

490
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the 3DS.

491
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:55,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

492
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just stupid.

493
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:02,224
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't release a console that's halfway done and then your sales are pretty shitty as it is.

494
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:05,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And then stuff that's promised at the launch of that stuff, you know,

495
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:34,052
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just delay after delay I'm not quite as negative as Loki is on this issue really Nintendo really only needs to do just a couple things to make me buy the new system as long as it's high definition and capable of pretty graphics and it has a new F-Zero game on it and it has a type of controller that's not quite so gimmicky where maybe I understand there's going to be some gimmick of some sort but as long as we can kind of tone it down a little bit I'll be in I'm fine

496
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Even like 2 out of 3 ain't bad.

497
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:38,035
[SPEAKER_04]: If they don't really give me an F-Zero game, I guess I can't be that upset.

498
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:39,236
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really want it.

499
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, really want an F-Zero game.

500
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:43,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And now would be a perfect time.

501
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:50,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless this whole touch thing ends up actually being true, because I don't know how you'd incorporate that into an F-Zero game.

502
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,787
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think the touch thing is utter bullshit.

503
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:55,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's total bullshit, but I guess we'll see.

504
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong.

505
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:58,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

506
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:00,222
[SPEAKER_04]: 360, Sony, Nintendo

507
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,820
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

508
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

509
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,780
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what the rumors say.

510
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,642
[SPEAKER_04]: The official Microsoft statement says,

511
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,682
[SPEAKER_04]: and are proactively reaching out to customers that may be impacted to replace their console.

512
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:31,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Any Xbox 360 owners receiving this error are encouraged to contact us at xbox.com support contact so we can verify if the console has been impacted.

513
00:42:32,026 --> 00:42:32,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

514
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Using that whole fact that they send information over the internet automatically about your console to Microsoft, they're able to tell exactly who's affected by this and send them replacements.

515
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:44,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

516
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,274
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

517
00:43:13,644 --> 00:43:19,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it's the original 360s, but they've all Red Ringed by now anyway, so that's why it's such a small number.

518
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:21,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It is one of the original, I think, drives.

519
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:26,314
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the, either the Samsung, Hitachi, or the... Interesting.

520
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:28,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the last one there.

521
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Toshiba.

522
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:36,196
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, also speaking about Xbox 360, PayPal has been rolling out in certain territories.

523
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:47,662
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an automatic update that was going out, and it's going to certain regions first, and now you can actually use PayPal as a billing option on your console.

524
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:51,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that for Microsoft Points and other types of marketplace content.

525
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently...

526
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That has all been rolling out over the past week.

527
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:58,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember updating my console, but it might have been done when I was around.

528
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,873
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't been, like I didn't get an update on Friday for my consoles.

529
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just certain regions right now.

530
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: May 27th is when Avatar Connect is scheduled to come out.

531
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:13,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the, if you are too shy to use voice chat, or I'm sorry, video chat.

532
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know your Connect has video chat.

533
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:20,308
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to use fake people instead to chat, you'll be able to do that on the 27th.

534
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:23,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

535
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:26,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with another news story and then we'll get to the release dates.

536
00:44:27,954 --> 00:44:35,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, going back to Microsoft, there has been word about something that according to our show role is the Connect Fub Lab.

537
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:36,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

538
00:44:37,645 --> 00:44:40,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I have fubby fat fingers and I think I meant to type fun.

539
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:42,231
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to give you a hard time.

540
00:44:42,982 --> 00:44:48,146
[SPEAKER_13]: The Connect Fun Lab might be revealed at E3.

541
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:57,913
[SPEAKER_13]: They are going to be doing a lot of stuff for the Connect, but there is a source that said that something called Connect Fun Lab is in the works to be revealed there.

542
00:44:57,933 --> 00:45:01,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not really sure what it is.

543
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:09,060
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also another possible Connect title that's called Connect Me that's on the Australia Classifications Board and has Microsoft as a publisher.

544
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:11,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Crimson Alliance and Fusion Genesis

545
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusion Genesis, I know what that is.

546
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another Fusion Frenzy game.

547
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:34,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Crimson Alliance, that sounds like another Crimson Skies game, which sounds kind of cool.

548
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:37,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But Fusion Frenzy, no!

549
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:40,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Crimson Alliance is by Certain Affinity and they did Age of Booty.

550
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:42,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

551
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:46,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't know if that's what it is, but... Fusion Frenzy!

552
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:50,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.

553
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:52,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make another Fusion Frenzy game.

554
00:45:52,026 --> 00:45:52,807
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all terrible.

555
00:45:53,968 --> 00:46:19,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, hopefully that isn't what it is, but I'm a little more worried about Kinect Fun Lab Because I thought that this year was the year we're going to see at E3 what the Kinect can really do Alright, we've seen all the Nintendo rip-offs, now let's see what the Kinect can really do It can really rip off Nintendo now I hear Fun Lab and I think, oh goody, it's a lab full of mini-games Fun, fun, fun, fun

556
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:20,748
[SPEAKER_13]: or it's all puppies.

557
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:21,968
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all lab puppies.

558
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:28,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Fun Lab has to do with genetic mutations of people.

559
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your own monster.

560
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, create your own alien or something.

561
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:32,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want fucking minigames.

562
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that would be Fun Lab.

563
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:36,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you make them fight through Xbox Live.

564
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and it's okay.

565
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:38,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all virtual.

566
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:39,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not real.

567
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.

568
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:44,301
[SPEAKER_04]: A magic pen gel where I draw with my hands.

569
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:50,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I smear paint to make creatures like it's a monkey smearing poop on the wall.

570
00:46:50,463 --> 00:46:51,324
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great.

571
00:46:51,344 --> 00:46:51,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun Lab.

572
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:52,764
[SPEAKER_13]: I would play that.

573
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:54,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Monkey Poo Fun Lab.

574
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:56,245
[SPEAKER_13]: I would play that.

575
00:46:56,685 --> 00:46:57,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Monkey Poo Fun Lab.

576
00:46:58,006 --> 00:46:58,346
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

577
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around the world and look at some release dates.

578
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,032
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

579
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:24,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Kung Fu Panda 2, another movie tie-in game.

580
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:27,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one, it's a little weird.

581
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:30,319
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing something different on every single platform.

582
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:33,759
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation 3 game is just a PlayStation 3 game.

583
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,960
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 is getting a Kinect game.

584
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii is getting a U-Draw game.

585
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:45,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And then DS is just another regular DS game.

586
00:47:47,302 --> 00:48:02,368
[SPEAKER_03]: so those will be out later this week and then let's see here this is fucking slow today other fun stuff like what?

587
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:04,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is updating.

588
00:48:04,543 --> 00:48:05,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Monkey Pooh Smear.

589
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Monkey Pooh Smear, yes.

590
00:48:07,165 --> 00:48:10,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Monkey Pooh Smear is coming out this week on all platforms, including the Atari.

591
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:12,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks very exciting.

592
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:16,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm trying to see what else we have here.

593
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really small week, but I know it's more than just those two titles.

594
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, cooperate.

595
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:26,230
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

596
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeons & Dragons Daggerdale for PC.

597
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:30,071
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out this week.

598
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:36,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Naughty Bear, the Gold Edition, in case you didn't buy that game.

599
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:42,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out now with all the download content at a budget price on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

600
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:45,338
[SPEAKER_03]: NASCAR 2011 on the Wii.

601
00:48:45,778 --> 00:48:48,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been delayed a little bit, so now it's finally coming out.

602
00:48:48,619 --> 00:49:06,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Paws and Claws Pampered Pets 2 for Nintendo DS out this week as well and Murder in Venice kind of an adventure game that's also for DS Cake Mania Main Street that's on DS this week and that is pretty much it

603
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:13,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we have some news for the U.S.

604
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,341
[SPEAKER_13]: For overseas, in the U.K.

605
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:19,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's actually just a few games.

606
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:25,168
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 24th, we have Dirt 3 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.

607
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:28,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also have Kung Fu Panda for the DS.

608
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:33,373
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the 27th is Gladiator Begins on the PSP.

609
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:39,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the 30th, we have Fable 3 for PC, which, why it's taking so dang long to come out, oh well, we don't know.

610
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:40,759
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

611
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Fable 3, I will go ahead and warn our UK viewers.

612
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:48,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I've got friends that love, when I say viewers, it's listeners.

613
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:53,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got friends that love Fable 3, but it's really not all that great.

614
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:55,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Fable 2 is so much of a better game.

615
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:56,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you think?

616
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:05,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable 2 is alright, but Fable 3 didn't look like they added too much stuff to it, so I passed on it.

617
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't trust anything Peter Molyneux says.

618
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:10,051
[SPEAKER_03]: He's full of shit.

619
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:13,332
[SPEAKER_13]: That means he needs to probably go potty.

620
00:50:14,132 --> 00:50:14,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

621
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:16,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Except every time he potties a new game comes out.

622
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

623
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:18,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

624
00:50:20,399 --> 00:50:36,555
[SPEAKER_13]: and uh well I have really nothing else on for UK I mean there's they list games but they don't put dates on them like Back to the Future Double Vision is on the list but they didn't put a date on it so that's all and speaking of uh stuff that's coming out

625
00:50:37,148 --> 00:50:38,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Akai Katana Shin Red Katana New Death

626
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:10,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, people discovered a Bloodsword that takes human sacrifices to unleash its mass-destructive power.

627
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:12,259
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be Redsword Death, then.

628
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:15,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is an existing game that's already been out.

629
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:20,384
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 version will have new stages, new characters, and a new system, and the graphics will fit in a 16.9.

630
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:24,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm assuming this is a prior PlayStation 2 release.

631
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:28,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is coming out this week, and it's a shooter.

632
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:29,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it's a shooter.

633
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:30,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Cave.

634
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:30,631
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you expect?

635
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:31,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Warrior's Legend of Troy

636
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynasty Warriors, but with the Trojan horse.

637
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Trojan condoms, but the Trojan horse.

638
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:56,013
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a whole other type of game.

639
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:06,741
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, Hiro no Kakira Aizoban Akane Hiro no Suyoku comes out this week from Idea Factory in regular and limited edition.

640
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:10,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And this game is an adventure game.

641
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see what it is.

642
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,003
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

643
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it looks like every other.

644
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:36,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Infamous goes into the best series, meaning it gets a price reduction.

645
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:40,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobunaga, Noyabu, Tendo, and a power-up kit.

646
00:52:40,164 --> 00:52:41,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo, come out this week.

647
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,729
[SPEAKER_04]: That's $124 if you want both of those to import.

648
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:54,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Totori no Atelier, Arland no Rekken Jushutsu 2 goes into the Best Hits collection as well.

649
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:56,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So some price reductions this week.

650
00:52:58,173 --> 00:53:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the Nintendo systems, taking a look real quick.

651
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:06,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Wii, Pandora's Tower, Until I Return to Your Side comes out on the Wii this week.

652
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course I hear Pandora and I go, wait a minute, wasn't it what they call the Kid Icarus games over in Japan?

653
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:15,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Pandora's... I thought this was called Pandora's Adventure or something like that.

654
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:16,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Kid Icarus called that in Japan?

655
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:20,048
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is not what this is.

656
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:21,989
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not like a Kid Icarus game.

657
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:23,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some other type of game on the Wii.

658
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's in a black box instead of a white Wii box.

659
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:27,832
[SPEAKER_04]: So, ooh.

660
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

661
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:31,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on to the Nintendo 3DS.

662
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:35,716
[SPEAKER_04]: One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP comes out this week.

663
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:38,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, going to the PSP.

664
00:53:41,078 --> 00:53:49,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Shutsugeki, Kid Icarus, Hikari Shinwa, Palthena no Kagami, Light Myth, Palthena's Mirror

665
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:16,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, the game I was reading on the PSP, Shutsugeki Otomatashi no Senjo 2, comes out from System Soft this week on the PSP.

666
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:23,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a strategy game that involves anime chicks in hot outfits.

667
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:25,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, like, okay, look at these screenshots, okay?

668
00:54:26,355 --> 00:54:28,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You get, like, hot anime babe, right?

669
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:31,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have, like, anime babes in, like, little maid outfits, right?

670
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:32,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's...

671
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Driving in the streets with tanks and airplanes.

672
00:54:37,762 --> 00:54:39,924
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very manly sort of game.

673
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot anime babes and then tanks and fighter jets.

674
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:45,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

675
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:47,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-ordering it today.

676
00:54:49,348 --> 00:54:49,628
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

677
00:54:50,629 --> 00:54:55,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on and go over a couple more news stories, and we'll get into the classic game of the week.

678
00:54:55,872 --> 00:55:00,014
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's picked a very popular series tonight, so we'll get to that.

679
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:00,754
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

680
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:01,915
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, though, Loki.

681
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:03,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

682
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:18,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is kind of disappointing, because this was actually a game I was looking forward to checking out once the delayed Nintendo Store for the 3DS was released.

683
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:22,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but yes, like all things delayed, there are more delays.

684
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mega Man Legends 3 Prototype Version, a demo for a game that's not even finished yet...

685
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:33,927
[SPEAKER_03]: will be delayed from the 3DS eShop launch on June 6th.

686
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:37,930
[SPEAKER_03]: That is terrible.

687
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:46,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And they haven't really said yet when it's going to be released, but I guess you have to wait.

688
00:55:53,447 --> 00:56:06,295
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for that demo, basically, of the potential Mega Man Legends 3 game that might come out should enough people pay to get this demo concept of what it could possibly be.

689
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:18,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, you know, we may make this game, but you have to pay for this demo, and we may, we'll see.

690
00:56:18,399 --> 00:56:20,179
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I'll probably buy it anyway.

691
00:56:20,439 --> 00:56:20,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

692
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:33,702
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as, okay, here's my little stipulation, I guess we won't really know, because of course we're not going to get told, but my wish is as long as the game I'm not buying here in the DS shop ends up being a part of the actual full game.

693
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:38,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not want to be paying for what will be the first two chapters of the retail release.

694
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:42,850
[SPEAKER_04]: A side story or a leading into game, those are fine.

695
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,112
[SPEAKER_04]: A case zero is perfectly acceptable.

696
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:45,733
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

697
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:49,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want something that's just going to end up being the first chapter of the game.

698
00:56:50,797 --> 00:56:55,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom was also behind the Dead Rising case zero, which was actually a pretty cool little idea.

699
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:58,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So my hope is they're going to get this one right too.

700
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:00,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to hold my breath.

701
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:04,657
[SPEAKER_04]: LA Noire is a game that a lot of people are talking about this week.

702
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:08,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very kind of different sort of rock star game from what I understand.

703
00:57:08,482 --> 00:57:11,265
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going into it expecting 1940s Grand Theft Auto.

704
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:12,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not quite what they're getting.

705
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:15,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game seems to be pretty well received.

706
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're one of these people that are affected by the overheating.

707
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:28,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, firmware 3.61 on the PlayStation 3 is causing certain Sony consoles to overheat when playing L.A.

708
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:28,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

709
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:32,108
[SPEAKER_04]: This is according to Rockstar's own customer support.

710
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote,

711
00:57:41,278 --> 00:58:08,746
[SPEAKER_04]: mostly on older 60 and 80 gig fat models oh shit I have one of these models primary reports seem to be that updating to firmware 361 will cause playstations to overheat there have been various reports of this on a few different games now all reporting their playstation 3's turning off or red lighting after having installed 3.6.1 or 3.61 excuse me yikes well now if you're an xbox fanboy pointing and laughing and kicking sony while they're down hold it

712
00:58:09,426 --> 00:58:10,847
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

713
00:58:29,396 --> 00:58:35,180
[SPEAKER_04]: There are reported instances that Microsoft's system is having issues with this as well.

714
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:43,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Rockstar, of course, was blaming Sony originally, but now that the Xbox stuff is coming to light, they've changed a little bit.

715
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:44,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's their latest statement.

716
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:50,970
[SPEAKER_04]: We've received a very small number of customer support questions about PS3s overheating or shutting down while playing L.A.

717
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

718
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, Rockstar Games and Sony can confirm that neither L.A.

719
00:58:55,692 --> 00:58:57,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire or firmware update 3.61...

720
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:00,455
[SPEAKER_04]: are causing the PS3 hardware to overheat.

721
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:05,236
[SPEAKER_04]: We are both committed to working hard to find solutions to this and any issues that may arise.

722
00:59:05,736 --> 00:59:10,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that isn't the vaguest fucking thing I've ever heard, it's not the game and it's not the system.

723
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:14,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's really nothing else between that that would cause your system to overheat.

724
00:59:14,879 --> 00:59:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just you is really what I'm hearing in that statement.

725
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the system and it's not the game.

726
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:22,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just you.

727
00:59:22,962 --> 00:59:23,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not me.

728
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you.

729
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what the fuck kind of press release is that?

730
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:34,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not say, we recognize the problem and we are working on a solution?

731
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:36,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, how hard was that?

732
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:39,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Very hard.

733
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like Sony hasn't got bigger problems right now.

734
00:59:43,396 --> 00:59:46,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, this is more just that corporate bullshit.

735
00:59:46,279 --> 00:59:47,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, stop it.

736
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be real with the consumers.

737
00:59:50,363 --> 00:59:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: We see through your crap.

738
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:54,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

739
00:59:54,884 --> 01:00:00,347
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to go back into a time when gaming wasn't so full of such asshattery and bullshit.

740
01:00:00,907 --> 01:00:03,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

741
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we turn back the clock, take a stroll down memory lane, and find a classic game in the archives that DarkSakura says, Hey!

742
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen up, brats.

743
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:16,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be playing this game.

744
01:00:17,482 --> 01:00:19,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'll set your PlayStation 3 on fire myself.

745
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:20,784
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't even need Ellie anymore.

746
01:00:21,024 --> 01:00:24,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have my engineers invent combustible lemons that'll burn your PS3 down.

747
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:25,706
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

748
01:00:26,106 --> 01:00:27,647
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

749
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:28,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Mother.

750
01:00:31,649 --> 01:00:40,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Mother is, uh... Well, as we all know, is the precursor to Mother 2, which came out over here as Earthbound.

751
01:00:41,635 --> 01:00:42,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, um...

752
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:46,645
[SPEAKER_13]: This was... It came out on the Famicom.

753
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,154
[SPEAKER_13]: And it came out in...

754
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:54,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to find the year and it doesn't list the year on here.

755
01:00:54,553 --> 01:00:54,533
1989.

756
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:55,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, 1989.

757
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:56,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

758
01:00:57,255 --> 01:01:00,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was actually published by Nintendo.

759
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:06,338
[SPEAKER_13]: It was produced by Miyamoto and written by Shigesato Itoi.

760
01:01:06,738 --> 01:01:10,220
[SPEAKER_13]: So it has some fantastic names behind it.

761
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,082
[SPEAKER_13]: It was developed by Ape and Panic Softica and Nintendo Tokyo.

762
01:01:16,952 --> 01:01:17,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

763
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:37,445
[SPEAKER_13]: They localized that.

764
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:44,928
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is an official localized prototype of the game, and that was actually put out by DemiForce.

765
01:01:45,008 --> 01:01:53,111
[SPEAKER_13]: They used the ROM data that was from the prototype, and it's being put out as Earthbound Zero.

766
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:54,532
[SPEAKER_13]: And that actually made it out in 1998.

767
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:02,712
[SPEAKER_13]: The game itself has field maps and a battle system.

768
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:06,996
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't use an overworld map.

769
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:13,881
[SPEAKER_13]: It just basically... Sorry, my throat's getting messed up.

770
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:14,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Ninten

771
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:59,721
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you are on the field map, because like I said, it doesn't have an overall map, just has field maps, you will be attacked by enemies, and then you go into battle mode, where it's a first-person view, and you attack the creature or whatever, like a lamp, through the different menu system commands, and you have different actions for different characters.

772
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,102
[SPEAKER_13]: And you also...

773
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:09,598
[SPEAKER_13]: can do different moves in order that are based on the character's speed statistics.

774
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:12,319
[SPEAKER_13]: And you also, of course, get experience and level up that way.

775
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:19,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you lose all of your hit points, then you go to the hospital and you have to pay to revive your characters.

776
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:31,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And if every character dies, you don't lose your progress, but you go back to the last area that you saved at with only an intent alive and half of your money.

777
01:03:33,003 --> 01:03:34,143
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of crappy, huh?

778
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:36,654
[SPEAKER_13]: So at any rate... That's harsh.

779
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:44,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds harder than the pirated version of Earthbound where it would delete your own saved game when you got to the last boss.

780
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:45,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

781
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:46,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

782
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, after doubling the difficulty?

783
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:59,203
[SPEAKER_13]: At any rate, the game talks about a married couple in America who vanished after a dark shadow covered their town.

784
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:04,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Two years later, George, the husband, returns mysteriously.

785
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:10,527
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he starts studying in complete seclusion and his wife Maria is never heard from again.

786
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:19,731
[SPEAKER_13]: So you fast forward to 1988 where there's a 12-year-old boy named Minton who is attacked by a paranormal event.

787
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:22,074
[SPEAKER_13]: SmartKid

788
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:44,438
[SPEAKER_13]: So at any rate, he finds out that an invading race is, an alien race is, you know, invading.

789
01:04:45,138 --> 01:04:54,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they go to the world of Magicant where the ruler there, Queen Mary, asks Nintendo to find her a song called The Eight Melodies and play it to her.

790
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:55,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Play all the songs to her.

791
01:04:56,783 --> 01:05:03,086
[SPEAKER_13]: So he meets up with a dude named Lloyd and a girl named Anna.

792
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:05,607
[SPEAKER_13]: And she dreamed about him.

793
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:06,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh.

794
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:08,248
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the start of the game.

795
01:05:08,528 --> 01:05:12,711
[SPEAKER_13]: And you keep, you know, going through and you duel some dude named Teddy.

796
01:05:14,612 --> 01:05:17,934
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh... You have to, uh...

797
01:05:19,552 --> 01:05:41,491
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually funny because you have to, um, the queen tells you about an alien named, I'm hoping that I'm pronouncing this right, but I think it's Gigu, that's spelled G-Y-I-Y-G or something, but it's Gigu, which is actually the same way it was initially romanized for Earthbound in the unreleased translation.

798
01:05:41,511 --> 01:05:41,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

799
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it pretty much, you know, more fun, going saving the universe.

800
01:05:47,979 --> 01:05:53,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And the game actually did get a re-release in 2003 with Mother 2.

801
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:59,174
[SPEAKER_13]: And the tagline was, No Crying Until the End and a Guaranteed Masterpiece.

802
01:06:01,517 --> 01:06:09,286
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was actually designed by a Japanese copywriter and television personality, Shigesato Itoi.

803
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And the inspiration for the game was from John Lennon's young mother.

804
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:16,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And he also wanted the game to have a name that wasn't game-like.

805
01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:18,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that part.

806
01:06:18,497 --> 01:06:19,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

807
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:49,621
[SPEAKER_13]: and I like this quote here it said that the last parts of Mother were not tested for bugs and balance issues and when talking about it at a promotional event he humorously stated when we got to fine tuning the difficulty there I was like whatever so yeah there's a lot of people and I've started playing it a while back but never really got too much further into it who says this is a game that you have to grind and grind and grind and grind to get through

808
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:53,456
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

809
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:28,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Phil Sandhop, who said, and I'm quoting, once the NES squatted in the pipeline and shoved the game aside from its appointed time, I believe that the marketing execs just decided that the game would be too expensive to produce and unsuccessful without marketing, and that's why it fell into oblivion.

810
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:36,809
[SPEAKER_13]: They were doing a lot of stuff in localization, which was removing blood from enemy sprites, which was a censorship thing they had at the time.

811
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:40,031
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were going to extend the game's ending.

812
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:49,697
[SPEAKER_13]: So at any rate, Demiforce, as I mentioned before, found a beta cartridge on the internet, and they collected enough money to buy the game.

813
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:51,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when that happened.

814
01:07:52,018 --> 01:07:53,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in college and that was all going on.

815
01:07:55,163 --> 01:08:04,847
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they actually had to do modified versions with the copy protection disabled and renamed it Earthbound Zero so that it could separate it from Earthbound.

816
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:12,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And they actually put everything out.

817
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I thought it was neat that they bought the rights to do it.

818
01:08:15,931 --> 01:08:17,332
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was pretty cool.

819
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:25,588
[SPEAKER_13]: The music in it was done by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka.

820
01:08:26,448 --> 01:08:32,050
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was actually released on CD and cassette by Sony on August 21st, 1989.

821
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:33,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And it had 11 tracks.

822
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,251
[SPEAKER_13]: And 7 of them are vocal remakes.

823
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,893
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's got the eight melodies on there, one called Pollyanna.

824
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:53,678
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, on February 18, 2004, the soundtrack was re-released, digitally remastered, and songs from it appear in EarthBound, Mother 3, Super Smash Bros.

825
01:08:53,718 --> 01:08:54,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Melee, and Super Smash Bros.

826
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:55,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Brawl.

827
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,261
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's actually some pretty...

828
01:09:01,673 --> 01:09:06,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Big names that were included with the CD, including the St.

829
01:09:06,255 --> 01:09:07,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul's Cathedral Choir.

830
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:19,279
[SPEAKER_13]: It sold 400,000 copies in Japan, and in two polls by Famitsu, it was the 9th best game for the Famicom and the 38th best game of all time.

831
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:27,022
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the 4th most-won virtual console game in June 2008, according to Nintendo Power, and moved up to the 2nd most-wanted.

832
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:31,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it was called Dark and Mature.

833
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,280
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the game.

834
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:35,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, your classic game of the week.

835
01:09:36,163 --> 01:09:37,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother or Earthbound Zero?

836
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:39,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The Original.

837
01:09:40,066 --> 01:09:41,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Most folks in the U.S.

838
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:41,607
[SPEAKER_04]: have never seen.

839
01:09:41,787 --> 01:09:42,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

840
01:09:42,588 --> 01:09:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

841
01:09:44,349 --> 01:09:44,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Good pick.

842
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:45,891
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great series.

843
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:47,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that series had a lot of rabid fans.

844
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:51,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It does seem ridiculous that Nintendo really just kind of let it die.

845
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:55,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think I get some of the reasons behind it, but I don't know.

846
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:55,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

847
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:01,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pretty cute little RPG franchise that Nintendo had, and it's just kind of a bummer that they couldn't work around some of that.

848
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand maybe why things can't be re-released, but it's a bummer they can't get the same kind of concept and the whole modern RPG thing and kind of make it work with the new game.

849
01:10:14,097 --> 01:10:17,160
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe some things are just left better as classics.

850
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a break.

851
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:21,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

852
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:24,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a break.

853
01:10:26,124 --> 01:10:29,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming up after the break, we've got stories about Portal 2.

854
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:32,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, some folks find that game highly offensive.

855
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:35,047
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about who and why in a little while.

856
01:10:35,988 --> 01:10:39,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other Portal 2 news and E3 news already starting to come in.

857
01:10:39,789 --> 01:10:42,550
[SPEAKER_04]: How you can actually go to one of the press conferences.

858
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:45,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk a little bit about that when we come back after a quick break.

859
01:10:46,472 --> 01:10:47,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

860
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,015
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into those in just a minute.

861
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:15,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, some quick plugs for some other projects that we do, which we actually referenced already at the top of the show.

862
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:17,236
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to sell them again.

863
01:11:17,617 --> 01:11:18,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what?

864
01:11:18,337 --> 01:11:21,418
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really advertise anything on this show except our other shows.

865
01:11:21,498 --> 01:11:23,879
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's your commercial.

866
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,079
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's your show?

867
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:31,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Comic Insanity, which is at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

868
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:38,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talk about comics, but we also have a new segment where we talk about a classic comic of the week.

869
01:11:39,624 --> 01:11:47,687
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also have what Shadow calls the Random Encounter, which is talking about an old RPG.

870
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:50,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Classic RPG.

871
01:11:51,163 --> 01:11:53,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

872
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Throwing a little video game spin in your comic show.

873
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:55,944
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit.

874
01:11:56,665 --> 01:11:58,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to leave us, aren't you?

875
01:11:58,205 --> 01:12:00,146
[SPEAKER_13]: No, never, never, never, never, never.

876
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:02,886
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my big baby.

877
01:12:04,467 --> 01:12:07,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Your big nine-year-old crying bratty baby that says shit a lot.

878
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, gonna have to wash this mouth out with some lye soap.

879
01:12:13,108 --> 01:12:20,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, but yeah, we talk comics and it's me and Maureen Marvel and Dan Shadow and we're awesome!

880
01:12:20,677 --> 01:12:22,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen to us, we go live every Tuesday.

881
01:12:22,563 --> 01:12:50,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you like the WoW chat that we do at the top of the show sometimes during our gaming weeks there's a whole other show I have with my buddy Extover all about the World of Warcraft it's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth www.hordehouse.com and I promise you this week actually, well, the show that's on the feed right now because we tape Thursdays and we post Thursday night the show that's on the feed right now is the one with DarkSakura on it so it's a great episode I promise on this week's show

882
01:12:50,831 --> 01:12:55,154
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a shocking revelation that I'm going to get tons of shit for.

883
01:12:56,095 --> 01:12:57,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a hatin' on Rob episode.

884
01:12:58,437 --> 01:12:58,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

885
01:12:59,038 --> 01:12:59,218
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

886
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:02,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I was in my pajamas the entire time.

887
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,001
[SPEAKER_13]: It was awesome.

888
01:13:04,362 --> 01:13:04,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

889
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:08,205
[SPEAKER_04]: So, HordeHouse.com if you want more information like that.

890
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:12,829
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not quit WoW and I have not resigned my account, so get those thoughts out of your head.

891
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:17,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I always threaten to do it whenever Blizzard does something that pisses me off, but I have yet to.

892
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's not that.

893
01:13:19,676 --> 01:13:25,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news and then we'll get into the Twitter topics after that.

894
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:29,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Some quick stories that we want to throw at you, although we don't have a whole lot of time to discuss them.

895
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

896
01:13:31,419 --> 01:13:36,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, No More Heroes, Heroes Paradise is coming August 16th.

897
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:38,722
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

898
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a new Carmageddon being announced at E3 this year.

899
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:14,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming from Square Enix, apparently they have a countdown on the Carmageddon.com website.

900
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:19,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is counting down to June 1st, so maybe an announcement...

901
01:14:20,476 --> 01:14:23,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird, because when I think of Squeenix, I don't think of Carmageddon.

902
01:14:23,098 --> 01:14:32,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of role-playing games and dudes with big hair, but I keep forgetting, oh yeah, they have Eidos now, and that's where the Tomb Raider comes from and all that other stuff, so it's interesting.

903
01:14:33,727 --> 01:14:42,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, if you have a homebrew-enabled PSP, there's some pretty cool stuff you can do with that, including the PSP 3D plugin version 2.0.

904
01:14:42,575 --> 01:14:43,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been released.

905
01:14:44,096 --> 01:14:47,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It enables 3D for select PSP games.

906
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:54,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is of course the old school cyan red glasses that you can wear.

907
01:14:55,203 --> 01:14:57,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually play quite a few games in 3D.

908
01:14:57,845 --> 01:15:04,249
[SPEAKER_03]: They've just added support for Crisis Core, God Eater Burst, FIFA 11, and the third birthday.

909
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:09,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a pretty extensive list of games that actually are supported by it.

910
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:16,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Despicable Me, Ape Escape, Ridge Racer 2, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Grip Shift...

911
01:15:18,337 --> 01:15:20,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of big titles.

912
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:24,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Dead to Rights Reckoning, Star Wars Battlefront, Elite Squadron.

913
01:15:24,304 --> 01:15:25,806
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of a mix of everything.

914
01:15:27,508 --> 01:15:28,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Including Eye of Judgment Legends.

915
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:33,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Still won't sell them all the copies.

916
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandrea.com Dungeon Buster says, Carmageddon was so fun.

917
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And Amiga777 says, Carmageddon was Eidos' baby.

918
01:15:40,472 --> 01:15:41,313
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not necessarily.

919
01:15:41,373 --> 01:15:44,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that when I think of Squeenix, I don't really think of Carmageddon.

920
01:15:44,195 --> 01:15:45,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of role-playing games and stuff.

921
01:15:45,556 --> 01:15:51,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize they've done some other stuff throughout their history that wasn't quite like that, but I just, I don't know, I think of the other stuff.

922
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: But then Eidos is kind of the company that

923
01:15:55,663 --> 01:15:56,844
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

924
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

925
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's just they had a lot of paint to polish on it, or maybe they decided to do more with it than they had originally.

926
01:16:51,264 --> 01:16:51,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

927
01:16:51,865 --> 01:16:56,228
[SPEAKER_04]: But the iPad version of the game will come out a little bit later than the iPhone version.

928
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,611
[SPEAKER_04]: This is because of the higher resolution.

929
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:04,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Square does say one thing they are doing, redoing some of the artwork for the higher resolution.

930
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:06,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty awesome, actually.

931
01:17:06,237 --> 01:17:07,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So take a look at that.

932
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:13,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Wake is apparently getting a new game on Xbox Live Arcade.

933
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite what you'd think.

934
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:16,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a sequel or anything.

935
01:17:16,462 --> 01:17:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a game called Alan Wake's Night Springs.

936
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:21,104
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a rumor right now.

937
01:17:21,164 --> 01:17:22,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing that's been confirmed.

938
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:23,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

939
01:17:23,304 --> 01:17:24,185
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes a lot of sense.

940
01:17:24,325 --> 01:17:25,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Wake was a pretty...

941
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:26,186
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

942
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Wake really reminds me of Twin Peaks, but as a video... And when I say Twin Peaks, like the old show from 1990 with Kyle MacLachlan and David Lynch was the guy behind it, right?

943
01:17:53,546 --> 01:17:54,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Who killed Laura Palmer.

944
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:56,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Wake kind of really reminds me of that a lot.

945
01:17:56,568 --> 01:17:58,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And Twin Peaks had a show within a show.

946
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called like Ticket to Love or something like that.

947
01:18:00,712 --> 01:18:04,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the soap opera within the show that would explain some of the things that are actually going on.

948
01:18:04,635 --> 01:18:06,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Alan Wake has something just like that.

949
01:18:06,997 --> 01:18:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Night Springs.

950
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:08,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess that...

951
01:18:09,779 --> 01:18:11,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Show within a game is getting a spin-off.

952
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

953
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'd have a show within a show.

954
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:18,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not Alan Wake 2.

955
01:18:18,645 --> 01:18:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not more download content for the first game.

956
01:18:21,761 --> 01:18:24,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever this is, it is something new.

957
01:18:24,643 --> 01:18:25,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

958
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:35,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming from Capcom, we've talked about Monster Hunter on the PS3, but now Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting is coming to the iOS systems.

959
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom did announce it for June.

960
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:41,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting, it's coming out for the iOS devices.

961
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:44,194
[SPEAKER_04]: A new intuitive control system.

962
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:46,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not use the typical D-pad.

963
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:50,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, because I hate D-pad translations on the iPhone, because there is no D-pad on the iPhone.

964
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:52,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be kind of cool.

965
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use horizontal slashes and vertical slashes.

966
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:56,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a whole different little way of doing it.

967
01:18:57,652 --> 01:18:59,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably more information to come at E3.

968
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

969
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:03,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about some rock band news, too?

970
01:19:04,724 --> 01:19:06,304
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some Lady Gaga, Rob.

971
01:19:07,445 --> 01:19:14,127
[SPEAKER_13]: On this new download content pack is going to be Lady Gaga Pack 02.

972
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Born This Way, Love Game, and Paparazzi.

973
01:19:17,488 --> 01:19:20,188
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's also a couple of... Excuse me.

974
01:19:20,228 --> 01:19:21,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't mean to burp on the mic.

975
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:30,434
[SPEAKER_13]: There also will be a pro guitar upgrade for Alice in Chains Roosters and the White Stripes, Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.

976
01:19:31,074 --> 01:19:35,356
[SPEAKER_13]: And two individual songs that are by Foreigner, Hot-Blooded and Urgent.

977
01:19:36,717 --> 01:19:38,518
[SPEAKER_13]: So, those are in there.

978
01:19:39,299 --> 01:19:41,600
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there is Super Street Fighter 4.

979
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I always love an excuse to be able to play Lady Gaga on the show.

980
01:19:49,312 --> 01:19:50,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, DarkSakura, sing along.

981
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear the voice.

982
01:19:56,944 --> 01:19:58,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid of your voice, DarkSakura.

983
01:19:58,687 --> 01:19:59,929
[SPEAKER_04]: You were born this way, baby.

984
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:00,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

985
01:20:02,373 --> 01:20:03,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not drunk yet.

986
01:20:05,386 --> 01:20:30,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition is going to be coming to Steam and they had some issues bringing it out for the PC but now it's going to be on Steam and it will be $40 there are pre-orders available too and there's not going to be though any download content for Super Street Fighter Super Vanilla Street Fighter 4 I should say but the game will have a 10% discount for the Super Arcade Edition bringing it down to $36

987
01:20:32,734 --> 01:20:33,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay!

988
01:20:34,695 --> 01:20:42,101
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last of my batch of news is Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 has a release date.

989
01:20:43,281 --> 01:20:44,462
[SPEAKER_13]: That's in Europe, by the way.

990
01:20:44,562 --> 01:20:46,244
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be on July 1st.

991
01:20:46,924 --> 01:20:49,446
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's basically all the mobile suits.

992
01:20:49,566 --> 01:21:01,414
[SPEAKER_13]: You have 50 playable and upgradable characters, 70 playable and upgradable mecha, or the mobile suits, I should say, including the mobile suit Gundam 00 and mobile suit Gundam UC.

993
01:21:02,535 --> 01:21:07,777
[SPEAKER_13]: You also have three new gameplay systems that are Partner Strike, Emergency Dash, and Recovery Gauge.

994
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:09,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

995
01:21:10,997 --> 01:21:11,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Gundam.

996
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:12,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Gundam.

997
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:16,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hate to bring it back to Lady Gaga.

998
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

999
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:18,140
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is an important question.

1000
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:18,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important.

1001
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,200
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you don't.

1002
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize to the haters out there as well, but this is actually related to technology.

1003
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:26,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the commercial for Google Chrome with her in it?

1004
01:21:26,642 --> 01:21:27,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't watch TV, Rob.

1005
01:21:27,942 --> 01:21:28,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's on the internet.

1006
01:21:29,063 --> 01:21:29,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all over YouTube.

1007
01:21:30,003 --> 01:21:31,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how you're totally using Yiddish now.

1008
01:21:31,284 --> 01:21:31,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1009
01:21:56,139 --> 01:21:58,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk amongst yourselves.

1010
01:21:58,510 --> 01:21:59,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a topic.

1011
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:05,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Lady Gaga, neither Gaga nor a lady, if certain rumors are to be believed.

1012
01:22:07,058 --> 01:22:07,678
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

1013
01:22:07,898 --> 01:22:08,158
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1014
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:22,987
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, no, like the, and there's a Google Chrome commercial for, it's like a guy who, and you keep seeing the search box fill in with these different terms, like how to speak French, plane ticket to Paris.

1015
01:22:23,087 --> 01:22:26,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, the whole thing is about like a long distance relationship and how Google like helps them.

1016
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is a truffle?

1017
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:28,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1018
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:32,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really adorable and like, oh my god, Google does like the best commercials.

1019
01:22:32,535 --> 01:22:35,458
[SPEAKER_13]: I like people tell me that Chrome is a good... You know what?

1020
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:42,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I upgraded to Firefox 4 and my personal opinion is that it's absolute and utter fucking shit.

1021
01:22:42,426 --> 01:22:48,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it has slowed down my computer, certain websites are bored, Instagram, Firefox 4 is shit.

1022
01:22:48,072 --> 01:22:49,814
[SPEAKER_13]: See, Firefox 4 hasn't done anything...

1023
01:22:50,394 --> 01:22:52,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Firefox 3 is fine.

1024
01:22:52,195 --> 01:22:55,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a huge Firefox fan and supporter up until version 4, which is crap.

1025
01:22:56,196 --> 01:22:57,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I have switched to Chrome.

1026
01:22:57,417 --> 01:22:58,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I will now never look back.

1027
01:22:58,817 --> 01:23:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I did Chrome in the very beginning, and I was like, this is kind of crap.

1028
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:04,620
[SPEAKER_04]: But now Chrome is great.

1029
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,601
[SPEAKER_13]: See, none of my stuff's been borked with the upgrade.

1030
01:23:07,641 --> 01:23:08,821
[SPEAKER_13]: I still use my Fire FTP.

1031
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:09,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I use everything.

1032
01:23:10,442 --> 01:23:18,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, by the way, since we did talk about Lady Gaga's involvement, do you know that George Takei has a video out now?

1033
01:23:19,644 --> 01:23:21,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the It's Okay to Be Takei?

1034
01:23:21,404 --> 01:23:22,565
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Okay to Be Takei.

1035
01:23:22,705 --> 01:23:25,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that whole law in, what is it?

1036
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:25,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Kentucky?

1037
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:29,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever, but fuck, place it is.

1038
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Haha, lol, not anymore.

1039
01:23:31,246 --> 01:23:33,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Bend over.

1040
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:33,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

1041
01:23:34,847 --> 01:23:36,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I've decided that I want him to be my gay daddy.

1042
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:37,009
[SPEAKER_04]: For real, me too.

1043
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:38,090
[SPEAKER_04]: He should be all of our gay daddies.

1044
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:38,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1045
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And then whenever we... Logan, don't you want George Takei as your gay daddy?

1046
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:40,913
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1047
01:23:56,542 --> 01:24:01,043
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when we're naughty, he goes, oh my, you've been naughty.

1048
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:02,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

1049
01:24:02,684 --> 01:24:05,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Him and Betty White need a buddy comedy.

1050
01:24:06,165 --> 01:24:06,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my.

1051
01:24:07,905 --> 01:24:10,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't George Takei and Betty White need a buddy comedy?

1052
01:24:10,186 --> 01:24:10,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they do.

1053
01:24:10,726 --> 01:24:11,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1054
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be their opening day.

1055
01:24:13,547 --> 01:24:14,368
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1056
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:38,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And he really does have just like a sexy voice, especially considering his age.

1057
01:24:38,643 --> 01:24:39,944
[SPEAKER_13]: And he always has had.

1058
01:24:40,044 --> 01:24:40,485
[SPEAKER_13]: God.

1059
01:24:41,365 --> 01:24:44,367
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a voice that could melt like.

1060
01:24:46,108 --> 01:24:47,129
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a voice that.

1061
01:24:47,269 --> 01:24:49,470
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear his voice and your panties come off, right?

1062
01:24:54,853 --> 01:24:55,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a look.

1063
01:24:57,536 --> 01:25:02,162
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to think of what a super dense metal is that's hard to melt because he could melt it.

1064
01:25:02,683 --> 01:25:04,044
[SPEAKER_13]: He could make steam out of it.

1065
01:25:06,098 --> 01:25:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, how did we get on this subject?

1066
01:25:07,298 --> 01:25:08,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and that Kentucky Law?

1067
01:25:08,559 --> 01:25:09,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Total bullshit.

1068
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:10,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1069
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:11,179
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's okay to be TK.

1070
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:12,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I want the mug.

1071
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I love the little Star Trek emblem on it, all in rainbow.

1072
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,240
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.

1073
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even see that.

1074
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want one.

1075
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: My birthday's coming up, just saying.

1076
01:25:21,001 --> 01:25:25,242
[SPEAKER_13]: The website is itsoktobtk.org or .com or something.

1077
01:25:25,282 --> 01:25:26,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we got on a tangent.

1078
01:25:26,582 --> 01:25:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

1079
01:25:27,142 --> 01:25:27,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1080
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:28,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangent train.

1081
01:25:28,643 --> 01:25:30,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And Loki's like, I'm doing other stuff.

1082
01:25:30,649 --> 01:25:32,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, don't forget about the asexual people too.

1083
01:25:58,223 --> 01:25:59,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally missed my reference.

1084
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,245
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably a good thing.

1085
01:26:00,365 --> 01:26:00,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1086
01:26:00,925 --> 01:26:03,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with the Twitter topics for tonight.

1087
01:26:03,887 --> 01:26:06,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1088
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:07,971
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1089
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:14,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually being rude and I'm like totally ignoring chat comments right now.

1090
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, chatters.

1091
01:26:15,076 --> 01:26:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just, I was really into the whole George and Betty buddy comedy talk.

1092
01:26:18,919 --> 01:26:22,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai Judo in the chat room says George and Betty should have a podcast.

1093
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:24,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely they should.

1094
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:25,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1095
01:26:25,831 --> 01:26:32,255
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, George Takei may be best known for Star Trek, but he made a contribution to Star Wars doing a voice for an episode of The Clone Wars.

1096
01:26:32,695 --> 01:26:33,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

1097
01:26:33,776 --> 01:26:39,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob Coffee says, I wanted the powers to be, or that be, to make that Sulu Excelsior series happen.

1098
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been a win.

1099
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:45,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that George Takei is involved with the Star Trek fandom the way he is.

1100
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:46,264
[SPEAKER_04]: He just gets it.

1101
01:26:47,445 --> 01:26:48,226
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just awesome.

1102
01:26:48,926 --> 01:26:49,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1103
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:52,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter topics.

1104
01:26:55,151 --> 01:26:57,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the first Twitter topic tonight.

1105
01:26:57,453 --> 01:27:05,219
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from, and I'm horribly going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize in advance, but it's Ramaditya Knight sends us his first tweet.

1106
01:27:05,739 --> 01:27:12,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me playing Scars of Time with my flute, and we're linked to a YouTubey, and this better not be a Rickroll.

1107
01:27:13,126 --> 01:27:13,766
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, it's not.

1108
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:15,107
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

1109
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:16,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play a little clip of this.

1110
01:27:16,628 --> 01:27:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see one of our listeners playing Scars of Time on the flute.

1111
01:27:19,271 --> 01:27:20,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me fast forward a little bit here.

1112
01:27:27,734 --> 01:27:28,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad!

1113
01:27:31,676 --> 01:27:35,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is not like a sideways flute, this is like a pan flute.

1114
01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:37,339
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he's playing on the tin whistle.

1115
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very authentic.

1116
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:40,861
Yeah.

1117
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:41,761
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

1118
01:27:48,508 --> 01:27:51,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the setup is for this video.

1119
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like he's in a classroom or something.

1120
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,995
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some lady holding the mic there.

1121
01:27:58,395 --> 01:28:00,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And this camera person is making me dizzy.

1122
01:28:00,117 --> 01:28:01,578
[SPEAKER_04]: They just turned the thing sideways.

1123
01:28:02,018 --> 01:28:02,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1124
01:28:02,418 --> 01:28:03,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that theme.

1125
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:03,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1126
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great video game song.

1127
01:28:05,841 --> 01:28:15,448
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know Scars of Time, you need to pause this podcast and go onto YouTube and either look at this guy's rendition or go just find the original song like ASAP.

1128
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1129
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:24,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to some other tweets here from SSJ100 Matt.

1130
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:27,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about this earlier in the week too.

1131
01:28:27,695 --> 01:28:28,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what you guys think of this.

1132
01:28:29,015 --> 01:28:32,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what sucks up the most internet bandwidth in the US?

1133
01:28:32,717 --> 01:28:33,918
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, did you hear this story?

1134
01:28:34,738 --> 01:28:35,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let me have you guess.

1135
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:39,721
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think takes up the most internet bandwidth of anything?

1136
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:42,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I'm assuming you heard this one.

1137
01:28:43,142 --> 01:28:45,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so DarkSakura, since she didn't read it.

1138
01:28:45,142 --> 01:28:48,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if we want to go with all of the hype, I would say Illegal Downloads.

1139
01:28:49,703 --> 01:28:51,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good guess, actually, probably.

1140
01:28:52,084 --> 01:28:52,664
[SPEAKER_04]: What about AFTA?

1141
01:28:52,704 --> 01:28:54,364
[SPEAKER_04]: What legal thing do you think takes up the most bandwidth?

1142
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:58,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if there's one particular site that's eating up more bandwidth than anybody else, who do you think it is?

1143
01:28:58,886 --> 01:28:59,246
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube.

1144
01:29:00,886 --> 01:29:04,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Both good guesses, but actually, the most bandwidth in the U.S.

1145
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:07,708
[SPEAKER_04]: is Netflix on video game consoles right now.

1146
01:29:08,068 --> 01:29:08,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1147
01:29:08,622 --> 01:29:12,684
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt links us to an article about that Netflix is the top user of bandwidth.

1148
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:40,894
[SPEAKER_04]: On the internet, nearly 20% of peak hour downstream traffic in North America is used for streaming video over Netflix through a home video game console representing the most usage of any source.

1149
01:29:41,234 --> 01:29:45,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a testament to how fast this whole technology and the game console stuff picked on.

1150
01:29:46,036 --> 01:29:50,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, game consoles are selling for the mere fact that you can use them as instant Netflix boxes.

1151
01:29:51,437 --> 01:29:58,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't lie to yourself that this isn't a selling point for a lot of 360s and PlayStations and Wii's of the... Excuse me.

1152
01:29:59,604 --> 01:30:00,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiccups are killer.

1153
01:30:00,585 --> 01:30:01,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And Wii's of the world, you know?

1154
01:30:01,986 --> 01:30:08,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo really had to get on with Netflix with the whole Wii, and I'm sure their next console will be on it as well.

1155
01:30:09,052 --> 01:30:09,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1156
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:17,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The three game consoles that support Netflix, the Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, accounted for the majority of that usage.

1157
01:30:17,437 --> 01:30:26,501
[SPEAKER_04]: When combined, consoles accounted for 66.3% of the figure, or 19.7% of overall downstream usage.

1158
01:30:27,762 --> 01:30:28,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

1159
01:30:29,343 --> 01:30:29,783
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1160
01:30:30,103 --> 01:30:34,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, Amiga, it's not porn that is taking up the most bandwidth.

1161
01:30:34,925 --> 01:30:35,886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good guess, though.

1162
01:30:37,394 --> 01:30:37,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1163
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:39,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to some other tweets.

1164
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:48,860
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S tweets us and says, Hey, if you go to www.freeplayday.com, you can get a free $10 play at Dave & Buster's.

1165
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, I just did a total commercial for some website.

1166
01:30:53,242 --> 01:30:56,904
[SPEAKER_04]: If that wasn't Ranma S and I knew he's like a legitimate person, I would have thought that was a spoiler.

1167
01:30:56,924 --> 01:30:57,224
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1168
01:30:57,344 --> 01:31:02,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I've gotten like five $10 off coupons from Dave & Buster's just by being in their little club thing.

1169
01:31:03,047 --> 01:31:04,128
[SPEAKER_13]: So they've...

1170
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:05,669
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.

1171
01:31:26,452 --> 01:31:29,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Same card ever since then, and it has given me problems.

1172
01:31:29,794 --> 01:31:36,659
[SPEAKER_04]: When I went to Times Square once, I went to an OLR lunch with some of the OLR listeners, like Zaku, Ranma, some of the people you've heard call into this show before.

1173
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:46,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Went to lunch with them and some others, and they saw my card get borked by the system because I didn't roam it, so I had to get it saved, and then it happened when I came back.

1174
01:31:46,485 --> 01:31:48,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So long story short, I've used the same card for 10 years.

1175
01:31:49,327 --> 01:31:54,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Dave & Buster's has this program where once you spend a certain amount of chips, you go gold.

1176
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1177
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna go on Wednesday night This is serious business

1178
01:32:37,749 --> 01:32:37,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

1179
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:39,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take Dan.

1180
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:41,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan and I can have date night at Dave and Buster's.

1181
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:43,371
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't have classes on Wednesday night anymore.

1182
01:32:43,511 --> 01:32:43,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1183
01:32:43,831 --> 01:32:49,873
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have to get up at 8.30 in the freaking morning on Monday and Wednesday to go to astronomy, which I don't need astronomy.

1184
01:32:51,153 --> 01:32:51,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get me started.

1185
01:32:53,274 --> 01:32:54,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to go look at the planets?

1186
01:32:55,743 --> 01:32:58,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no need for astronomy as a designer.

1187
01:32:58,225 --> 01:32:59,045
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your major?

1188
01:32:59,065 --> 01:32:59,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Graphic design.

1189
01:33:00,726 --> 01:33:03,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already have... You need to know how to draw lines.

1190
01:33:03,308 --> 01:33:06,670
[SPEAKER_13]: My degree will be here in like a few weeks.

1191
01:33:07,611 --> 01:33:09,012
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm officially a graduate.

1192
01:33:10,753 --> 01:33:11,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1193
01:33:11,193 --> 01:33:15,576
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get a letter in seven degrees saying, sorry, you need some astronomy.

1194
01:33:16,129 --> 01:33:18,250
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me go to a couple tweets from Tigerclaw.

1195
01:33:18,651 --> 01:33:21,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw is funny because he tweeted us a couple things.

1196
01:33:21,673 --> 01:33:24,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, you tweeted us stuff that's going to come up later in the show.

1197
01:33:24,395 --> 01:33:25,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So he tweeted like seven things.

1198
01:33:27,156 --> 01:33:29,558
[SPEAKER_04]: But you only get two, Tigerclaw, but I'll read these.

1199
01:33:29,598 --> 01:33:30,699
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the ones that caught my eye.

1200
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:34,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix is announcing a new game at E3.

1201
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:37,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll file this between Dunn, of course, but, I mean, it's official.

1202
01:33:38,324 --> 01:33:40,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix is going to announce something new at E3.

1203
01:33:40,465 --> 01:33:42,226
[SPEAKER_03]: What does go between Dunn, of course?

1204
01:33:42,387 --> 01:33:45,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central 2 apparently is going to go between those two.

1205
01:33:46,669 --> 01:34:06,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if there is actually like something else with this as well they have said it is not Rock Band 4 that is confirmed and apparently there was an interview with Game Informer saying quote rest assured that Harmonix is still developing new ideas and concepts to advance the Rock Band franchise and we look forward to sharing them when the time is right

1206
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:09,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Harmonix is all about Dance Central necessarily.

1207
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there'll be something new from them.

1208
01:34:11,716 --> 01:34:14,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hope it's a DJ game.

1209
01:34:14,377 --> 01:34:15,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's a DJ game too.

1210
01:34:16,278 --> 01:34:17,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

1211
01:34:17,538 --> 01:34:19,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they should just do it.

1212
01:34:19,539 --> 01:34:21,300
[SPEAKER_04]: If Konami refuses, then you know what?

1213
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:28,843
[SPEAKER_04]: When they fall asleep at the wheel, as they always have with their series that could do great here, then let Harmonix do it better.

1214
01:34:30,544 --> 01:34:30,864
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

1215
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,507
[SPEAKER_04]: One other one I'm going to read here.

1216
01:34:34,107 --> 01:34:34,227
[SPEAKER_04]: L.A.

1217
01:34:34,267 --> 01:34:38,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire, we were talking about earlier in the show, it is banned if you live in the UAE.

1218
01:34:39,509 --> 01:34:40,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yep, there it is.

1219
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:50,893
[SPEAKER_04]: United Arab Emirates, the game magazine there, I'm sorry, the retail chain, Geekay Games, I keep reading it as Geeky Games, updated their Facebook saying, L.A.

1220
01:34:50,913 --> 01:34:51,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire has been banned.

1221
01:34:52,814 --> 01:34:55,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, their National Media Council.

1222
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't say why they've banned the game, but they've banned it.

1223
01:34:58,998 --> 01:35:01,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably has something to do with dead woman beaver.

1224
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just taking a speculation.

1225
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Just guessing.

1226
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:09,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead animals are nothing to, you know.

1227
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:12,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead animals are nothing to ban a video game about.

1228
01:35:12,046 --> 01:35:13,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it Winona's brown beaver?

1229
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think her name's Winona.

1230
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1231
01:35:20,529 --> 01:35:20,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it is.

1232
01:35:21,009 --> 01:35:21,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1233
01:35:21,289 --> 01:35:22,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played Eleanor yet.

1234
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that does it for Twitter topics.

1235
01:35:23,831 --> 01:35:26,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send your shit early for next week.

1236
01:35:27,153 --> 01:35:27,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1237
01:35:27,893 --> 01:35:30,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I just outed myself as a Primus fan.

1238
01:35:32,816 --> 01:35:33,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1239
01:35:33,876 --> 01:35:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, let's get into some other news.

1240
01:35:35,497 --> 01:35:36,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1241
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:40,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is kind of... I don't know...

1242
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:43,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Zynga Frontierville Oregon Trail

1243
01:35:59,491 --> 01:36:00,812
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1244
01:36:17,276 --> 01:36:41,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the learning company, the people that hold the rights to the Oregon Trail They're none too happy about the fact that Zynga is basically ripping off their game And even calling it the Oregon Trail expansion I mean, granted, yes, the Oregon Trail is a real thing But it's also very, very, very, very similar to the Oregon Trail game

1245
01:36:42,632 --> 01:36:46,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually I would go off on a tangent right now about frivolous lawsuits, etc, etc.

1246
01:36:46,933 --> 01:36:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's Zynga and I'm just kind of like, eh, let them.

1247
01:36:49,814 --> 01:37:00,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched the trailer and that damn thing is, you know, if not a really lame version of the Oregon Trail that you would see on Facebook, it is basically everything that's part of the Oregon Trail.

1248
01:37:00,676 --> 01:37:09,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I realize the Oregon Trail is like a historic thing, but the other tricky thing about it is that Oregon Trail is actually on Facebook as a game right now.

1249
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:11,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1250
01:37:13,301 --> 01:37:17,983
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, unpopular opinion, the actual trail was called the Oregon Trail.

1251
01:37:18,043 --> 01:37:21,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt they have the rights to everything related to that historical event.

1252
01:37:21,885 --> 01:37:23,705
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not an unpopular opinion.

1253
01:37:23,745 --> 01:37:24,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

1254
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:25,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I don't know.

1255
01:37:26,727 --> 01:37:32,929
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many other game companies that need to be advocated for that I don't feel the need to save Zynga right now.

1256
01:37:33,269 --> 01:37:33,970
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1257
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:35,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, sorry.

1258
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:35,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga.

1259
01:37:37,714 --> 01:37:42,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look at this trail, er... Hopefully I don't get sued because I said trail.

1260
01:37:42,638 --> 01:37:44,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look at this trailer real fast here.

1261
01:37:58,035 --> 01:38:00,715
[SPEAKER_11]: and a carpenter for fixing the wagon and such like.

1262
01:38:01,436 --> 01:38:05,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And a doctor in case folks come down with the Rocky Mountain Scoots.

1263
01:38:05,436 --> 01:38:11,257
[SPEAKER_11]: You can leave messages and fancy presents for your friends so they'll want to visit your expedition every day.

1264
01:38:11,537 --> 01:38:15,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I gotta be honest, this really does look like the Facebook game, the Oregon Trail Facebook game.

1265
01:38:15,898 --> 01:38:20,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, especially with the hunting thing and the whole fact how you invite your friends to go on the trail with you.

1266
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think they have a point, actually.

1267
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I really can't help zing on this one.

1268
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, sorry.

1269
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1270
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:35,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing video of any Zynga game being played makes me hate Facebook.

1271
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:39,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I have hatred of Facebook, you know, thanks to Zynga.

1272
01:38:39,942 --> 01:38:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, invite your friends!

1273
01:38:41,962 --> 01:38:44,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate when people invite me to shit.

1274
01:38:44,163 --> 01:38:46,143
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I do with people that invite me to shit?

1275
01:38:46,663 --> 01:38:47,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I ignore it.

1276
01:38:48,824 --> 01:38:53,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And perhaps block you from sending me invites for shit.

1277
01:38:54,865 --> 01:38:56,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not play Facebook games.

1278
01:38:57,538 --> 01:39:07,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I deleted all mine You guys would be impressed I didn't even play GagaVille I didn't play it I'm sorry, okay?

1279
01:39:07,287 --> 01:39:10,290
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sold out, okay?

1280
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:16,250
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sold out.

1281
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:16,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1282
01:39:17,091 --> 01:39:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: You're teaming up with Zynga for shit.

1283
01:39:20,434 --> 01:39:29,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit if they donated money to the Tsunami stuff, but they donated it through you or you donated it through them.

1284
01:39:29,684 --> 01:39:30,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

1285
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:30,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1286
01:39:31,385 --> 01:39:33,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's retarded that you're...

1287
01:39:34,829 --> 01:39:40,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I'm not going to play it.

1288
01:39:40,272 --> 01:39:41,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to play it.

1289
01:39:42,333 --> 01:39:43,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, you hit the nail on the head.

1290
01:39:43,754 --> 01:39:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It was smart because it's going after the target audience.

1291
01:39:46,075 --> 01:39:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean to sound like a sexist, but it's a bunch of women playing Farmville.

1292
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:56,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's who a lot of Gaga's music appeals to.

1293
01:39:56,501 --> 01:39:59,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Most, not all, most of the Gaga haters are straight men.

1294
01:39:59,823 --> 01:40:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just...

1295
01:40:01,524 --> 01:40:04,806
[SPEAKER_13]: I did, however, find an incredibly hilarious screen capture.

1296
01:40:05,086 --> 01:40:08,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Madonna, back in the day, did some really weird shit, okay?

1297
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:09,649
[SPEAKER_03]: She was really weird.

1298
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:15,112
[SPEAKER_04]: She sold her soul to Pepsi, and then they just fucked her over after that whole like a prayer thing.

1299
01:40:15,717 --> 01:40:18,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gaga is like, you know, Madonna to Eleven.

1300
01:40:18,819 --> 01:40:22,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... Seriously, she's fucking... No, she is.

1301
01:40:22,421 --> 01:40:25,342
[SPEAKER_03]: She's actually more like Marilyn Manson than she is Madonna.

1302
01:40:25,362 --> 01:40:26,783
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just fucking crazy.

1303
01:40:27,163 --> 01:40:28,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what happened to Marilyn Manson?

1304
01:40:28,985 --> 01:40:30,245
[SPEAKER_03]: People stopped caring!

1305
01:40:30,585 --> 01:40:32,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's gonna happen to Lady Gaga.

1306
01:40:32,386 --> 01:40:33,847
[SPEAKER_03]: People are gonna stop fucking caring.

1307
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:34,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what?

1308
01:40:34,968 --> 01:40:36,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta admit, her... I'll never stop.

1309
01:40:36,449 --> 01:40:36,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.

1310
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:38,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Her early music was okay.

1311
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But each song that comes out after that, I care less and less about.

1312
01:40:44,193 --> 01:40:45,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, she starts making up stuff.

1313
01:40:46,098 --> 01:40:46,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

1314
01:40:48,689 --> 01:40:53,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anybody can use spout out non-words, you know, in a song.

1315
01:40:53,171 --> 01:40:57,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's easy to do, but it's just, I don't get it.

1316
01:40:58,214 --> 01:41:11,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, Born This Way totally sounds like an anthem, you know, a gay anthem or something like that, that she, you know, crafted on purpose so that it gets played in gay clubs to make sure that she has, you know, the gay demographic.

1317
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's all it is.

1318
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:17,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's just figuring out how to, you know,

1319
01:41:20,903 --> 01:41:49,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I did find actually one interesting marketing thing that she did where they were giving away a can of monster fuel now I have to ask this since you talk about how Gaga's music gets weirder and weirder and I really hope I don't get screwed by clicking on random YouTube links but have you heard that Lady Gaga has a new song on her album called Scheisse which is German for shit so she literally has a song called shit on her new album let me play a little bit for you

1320
01:41:52,497 --> 01:41:58,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that isn't weird at all!

1321
01:42:01,845 --> 01:42:05,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Except, like... Wait, wait, wait, keep playing that for a second there.

1322
01:42:06,109 --> 01:42:09,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, it just sounded like a different song for a second.

1323
01:42:09,972 --> 01:42:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they... It sounded like another...

1324
01:42:16,886 --> 01:42:18,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki made me play Gaga, you guys.

1325
01:42:18,787 --> 01:42:19,228
[SPEAKER_04]: He made me.

1326
01:42:19,728 --> 01:42:20,769
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1327
01:42:20,849 --> 01:42:27,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoever did this thing should have used the Ashet instead of the B. Yeah, no.

1328
01:42:29,454 --> 01:42:30,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm serious.

1329
01:42:30,075 --> 01:42:35,758
[SPEAKER_03]: If that picture right there doesn't make her look like a Satan blow-up doll, I don't know what to say.

1330
01:42:35,838 --> 01:42:42,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she was on American Idol the other week as a mentor, which is just like, okay, whatever.

1331
01:42:42,563 --> 01:42:42,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You mad?

1332
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:44,084
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not mad.

1333
01:42:44,124 --> 01:42:46,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I just rolled my eyes.

1334
01:42:46,605 --> 01:42:49,626
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, okay, oh, it's my time on camera?

1335
01:42:49,646 --> 01:42:50,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say something crazy.

1336
01:42:51,888 --> 01:42:52,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.

1337
01:42:53,328 --> 01:42:57,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, okay, that wasn't really helpful at all, but thanks.

1338
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:02,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell she was wearing, but it was something retarded.

1339
01:43:03,014 --> 01:43:03,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

1340
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:08,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to stand for such gaga-hating on this program.

1341
01:43:08,221 --> 01:43:09,181
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a genius.

1342
01:43:10,222 --> 01:43:11,002
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a saint.

1343
01:43:11,043 --> 01:43:12,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1344
01:43:12,524 --> 01:43:13,244
[SPEAKER_04]: A genius?

1345
01:43:13,304 --> 01:43:14,965
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a genius.

1346
01:43:15,425 --> 01:43:19,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, we're talking about her on a fucking video game podcast.

1347
01:43:19,968 --> 01:43:23,311
[SPEAKER_04]: You bought all this crap hook, line, and sink.

1348
01:43:23,351 --> 01:43:25,912
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as an almost genius, I take offense to that.

1349
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:27,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1350
01:43:29,135 --> 01:43:30,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking knew this was going to happen.

1351
01:43:30,576 --> 01:43:31,856
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a fucking mistake.

1352
01:43:31,996 --> 01:43:33,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Revoke his Mensa membership immediately.

1353
01:43:34,818 --> 01:43:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, she's not a fucking genius.

1354
01:43:37,299 --> 01:43:38,899
[SPEAKER_03]: She's good at marketing, okay?

1355
01:43:38,959 --> 01:43:39,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1356
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:42,900
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that are in the magazine business that are good at marketing.

1357
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:51,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Jobs is good at marketing, but he's not fucking... Well, okay, he is fucking crazy, but he's not fucking... overtly fucking crazy, you know?

1358
01:43:53,923 --> 01:43:54,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, you know what?

1359
01:43:54,563 --> 01:43:55,163
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a fad.

1360
01:43:55,183 --> 01:43:55,723
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll go away.

1361
01:43:56,544 --> 01:43:57,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what's gonna happen.

1362
01:43:57,344 --> 01:43:58,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Madonna never went away, neither will she.

1363
01:43:59,004 --> 01:44:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, Madonna never went away.

1364
01:44:00,805 --> 01:44:02,285
[SPEAKER_13]: She showed everyone what the character looks like.

1365
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:04,563
[SPEAKER_03]: She went away, same with Cher.

1366
01:44:04,583 --> 01:44:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Cher, they're both gone.

1367
01:44:05,584 --> 01:44:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Cher turned 65 this week.

1368
01:44:07,046 --> 01:44:08,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Cher's eligible for Medicare.

1369
01:44:09,068 --> 01:44:09,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Feeling old?

1370
01:44:12,831 --> 01:44:13,312
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll go away.

1371
01:44:13,612 --> 01:44:14,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even care.

1372
01:44:15,133 --> 01:44:19,217
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, fact, there will be a Gaga video game sometime in her lifetime.

1373
01:44:19,277 --> 01:44:20,078
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hope so.

1374
01:44:20,659 --> 01:44:21,199
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hope so.

1375
01:44:21,219 --> 01:44:22,000
[SPEAKER_03]: There already is.

1376
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:23,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1377
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:24,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Gaga-ville, I guess.

1378
01:44:25,563 --> 01:44:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1379
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:28,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've all seen her cooch.

1380
01:44:28,587 --> 01:44:28,887
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1381
01:44:30,189 --> 01:44:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like... Is she wearing it on her face?

1382
01:44:32,071 --> 01:44:38,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I swear to God, you know, sometimes I wonder that she's just relocated her vagina to her face.

1383
01:44:38,698 --> 01:44:39,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would not surprise me.

1384
01:44:39,619 --> 01:44:43,203
[SPEAKER_04]: How did we get from the fucking Oregon Trail to Lady Gaga's vagina on her face?

1385
01:44:43,384 --> 01:44:44,004
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

1386
01:44:44,024 --> 01:44:44,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga.

1387
01:44:44,465 --> 01:44:44,945
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1388
01:44:45,686 --> 01:44:49,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet you anything that's going to be the next album cover is her with a...

1389
01:44:51,294 --> 01:44:59,201
[SPEAKER_03]: VJ Face It will be her coming out of her own vagina That'll be the Elmar right there She'll be coming out of her own vagina She's like, I'll be born!

1390
01:44:59,381 --> 01:45:17,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you need to see last night's I swear this will be the end of it, guys You need to see last night's Saturday Night Live performance Because she was on Saturday Night Live And she did Born This Way, her song And what she did during the performance She actually got pregnant And gave birth live on stage To a bunch of glitter During the performance

1391
01:45:18,377 --> 01:45:21,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an art piece and it was brilliant.

1392
01:45:21,559 --> 01:45:22,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It was brilliant.

1393
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:23,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I was moved.

1394
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:27,242
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, this is the last of the Gaga for me.

1395
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:30,383
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what she did to everybody who was camping out in line?

1396
01:45:30,904 --> 01:45:37,547
[SPEAKER_13]: She bought them dinner and donuts and coffee and signed autographs and took pictures with people waiting in line.

1397
01:45:38,267 --> 01:45:39,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Because she's a nice person.

1398
01:45:39,608 --> 01:45:41,189
[SPEAKER_04]: She genuinely likes her fans.

1399
01:45:42,249 --> 01:45:43,590
[SPEAKER_03]: She genuinely likes her fans.

1400
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:44,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1401
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:45,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1402
01:45:45,291 --> 01:45:47,052
[SPEAKER_03]: That still doesn't make you a fucking whore.

1403
01:45:47,972 --> 01:45:55,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you call what she did on stage art, then I'm sorry, a peep show is fucking art then.

1404
01:45:55,995 --> 01:45:56,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1405
01:45:56,535 --> 01:46:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more peep shows out there than there are gaga, so I guess we have that to be thankful.

1406
01:46:01,457 --> 01:46:02,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hate on peep shows.

1407
01:46:03,078 --> 01:46:06,159
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing you'll never hear me ranting about on this program, Loki.

1408
01:46:06,219 --> 01:46:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never touch your sacred pornography collection.

1409
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never.

1410
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing sacred about that.

1411
01:46:16,929 --> 01:46:17,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1412
01:46:17,529 --> 01:46:17,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1413
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:18,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1414
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:20,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get back to video games?

1415
01:46:20,391 --> 01:46:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's.

1416
01:46:20,772 --> 01:46:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1417
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:22,233
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very important.

1418
01:46:22,273 --> 01:46:22,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Look.

1419
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:27,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to go from Lady Gaga talking about very important video game news such as this.

1420
01:46:30,258 --> 01:46:37,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat Food Maker Friskies has released iPad and Android games for your cat.

1421
01:46:39,602 --> 01:46:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why Gaga's podcast has to end.

1422
01:46:41,643 --> 01:46:42,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute.

1423
01:46:42,083 --> 01:46:46,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have to talk about tasty treasures, party mix-up, and catfishing.

1424
01:46:47,105 --> 01:46:48,925
[SPEAKER_04]: iPad games for your cat.

1425
01:46:49,265 --> 01:46:51,166
[SPEAKER_03]: In iPad, pussy play with you.

1426
01:46:52,846 --> 01:46:56,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, you know, I watched the little video and it is super adorable.

1427
01:46:56,968 --> 01:47:00,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I would get this for Shermie if I had an iPad and she didn't have paws.

1428
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, this looks so cute.

1429
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:08,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Your little pet can touch the food and it splits up.

1430
01:47:09,804 --> 01:47:10,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Catfishing Catfishing

1431
01:47:32,887 --> 01:47:38,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Salacious Pop, my significant other in chatroom says, I am not buying Maruko, our cat, an iPad.

1432
01:47:38,394 --> 01:47:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.

1433
01:47:39,215 --> 01:47:40,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And to that I'm saying, no, no, no.

1434
01:47:40,316 --> 01:47:41,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not buying Maruko an iPad.

1435
01:47:41,457 --> 01:47:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You're buying me an iPad and maybe I'll let your cat play with it.

1436
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:49,267
[SPEAKER_04]: My birthday is June 26th.

1437
01:47:49,287 --> 01:47:49,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1438
01:47:49,767 --> 01:47:50,348
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so cute.

1439
01:47:50,408 --> 01:47:51,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting you a Takei mug.

1440
01:47:53,228 --> 01:48:06,654
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but in all seriousness, there's a lot to laugh at here when you're talking about kitties playing games on the iPad, but at the same time, it's oddly fucking fascinating that we are now to the point where we're making video games for the cats.

1441
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:09,789
[SPEAKER_13]: They're free, right?

1442
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:12,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope so because they're kind of commercial games.

1443
01:48:13,352 --> 01:48:13,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1444
01:48:15,313 --> 01:48:19,416
[SPEAKER_04]: The games do keep score and your cats can compete to see who has the best reaction time.

1445
01:48:19,436 --> 01:48:20,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Your cat don't give a shit.

1446
01:48:21,257 --> 01:48:22,879
[SPEAKER_13]: My cat gives a shit all over the floor.

1447
01:48:23,299 --> 01:48:25,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm not sure if they're free or not.

1448
01:48:27,102 --> 01:48:27,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see.

1449
01:48:29,227 --> 01:48:30,708
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't be more than a dollar.

1450
01:48:30,768 --> 01:48:31,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're not more than a dollar.

1451
01:48:31,889 --> 01:48:32,849
[SPEAKER_13]: They're probably free.

1452
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:36,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Because given the simplicity of the games, they're probably free.

1453
01:48:36,431 --> 01:48:38,413
[SPEAKER_13]: See, look, Shermie is not sleeping anymore.

1454
01:48:38,453 --> 01:48:39,613
[SPEAKER_13]: She's looking up and listening.

1455
01:48:40,294 --> 01:48:40,634
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1456
01:48:40,654 --> 01:48:43,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Shermie's like, fuck yeah, mommy, I want that.

1457
01:48:43,796 --> 01:48:45,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, mommy wants an iPad, baby, so you have to wait.

1458
01:48:46,778 --> 01:48:47,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell daddy that mommy wants an iPad.

1459
01:48:47,898 --> 01:48:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: She only wants an iPad so she can shit on it.

1460
01:48:49,559 --> 01:48:50,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what your cat will do.

1461
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:51,340
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1462
01:48:51,501 --> 01:48:52,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Your cat will be like, what's this game?

1463
01:48:53,582 --> 01:48:55,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Shermie, do you just want to shit on everything?

1464
01:48:58,021 --> 01:49:00,804
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw How long till they make games for dogs or ferrets?

1465
01:49:17,196 --> 01:49:18,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Byron D. Zero said something even funnier.

1466
01:49:18,857 --> 01:49:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1467
01:49:19,357 --> 01:49:20,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Rorschach and Deadpool.

1468
01:49:21,077 --> 01:49:24,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they played the same music that they played in part of that.

1469
01:49:26,718 --> 01:49:39,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop in our chat room says, This is a game for people who make their cats real Facebook pages and then comment with meow meow on their IRL profile with coworkers and shit on them.

1470
01:49:40,161 --> 01:49:46,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the people that creep me the crap out on Facebook when they do that for their pets and their babies.

1471
01:49:48,483 --> 01:49:49,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Your baby can't speak.

1472
01:49:50,943 --> 01:49:53,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And if your baby can speak, it's not anything intelligible by most people.

1473
01:49:54,924 --> 01:49:55,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Your baby doesn't need a Facebook.

1474
01:49:56,084 --> 01:49:57,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Your cat doesn't need a Facebook.

1475
01:49:57,064 --> 01:49:58,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Your dog doesn't need a Facebook.

1476
01:49:58,284 --> 01:50:02,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Your children, probably, even if they're up to seven years old, don't need a Facebook.

1477
01:50:02,845 --> 01:50:06,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the baby hit random buttons and autocorrected everything.

1478
01:50:06,986 --> 01:50:07,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, anyhow.

1479
01:50:35,444 --> 01:50:35,765
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1480
01:50:43,674 --> 01:50:47,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm actually still on the German alphabet website.

1481
01:50:47,336 --> 01:50:47,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Portal!

1482
01:50:48,717 --> 01:50:49,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Portal 2, Offended People.

1483
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:52,878
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know who the people had offended?

1484
01:50:53,639 --> 01:50:54,399
[SPEAKER_13]: The Adopted.

1485
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:00,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of all the cracks that GLaDOS makes in the game about the character being adopted.

1486
01:51:01,362 --> 01:51:04,664
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, I like it in the end when Wheatley's doing, goes, Fatty!

1487
01:51:04,804 --> 01:51:05,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Adopted Fatty!

1488
01:51:06,124 --> 01:51:09,586
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you are adopted and that's terrible.

1489
01:51:11,207 --> 01:51:11,747
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um...

1490
01:51:12,627 --> 01:51:31,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, basically this dude named Neil Staple was playing Portal 2, and he's the adopted father to Zoe, a Chinese orphan, and got pissed off when GLaDOS was going off on Chell for being adopted.

1491
01:51:32,406 --> 01:51:40,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, also overweight people and idiots are offended too, because they also talk about all that.

1492
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:45,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And probably trash is insulted, and probably turrets.

1493
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:57,511
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, it's the adopter who is insulted, not the adoptee.

1494
01:51:59,176 --> 01:51:59,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Again.

1495
01:51:59,957 --> 01:52:02,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, do we have local news story on this that we can play?

1496
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I love these.

1497
01:52:04,601 --> 01:52:08,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when local news media like completely misrepresents video games.

1498
01:52:08,084 --> 01:52:08,945
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be amazing.

1499
01:52:09,265 --> 01:52:10,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to play this.

1500
01:52:10,186 --> 01:52:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?

1501
01:52:12,528 --> 01:52:16,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're lucky, maybe somehow Loki can turn this into Lady Gaga chat.

1502
01:52:17,352 --> 01:52:22,596
[SPEAKER_00]: And tonight, a father is shocked at the insensitivity he says he witnessed.

1503
01:52:22,857 --> 01:52:23,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the clip.

1504
01:52:24,378 --> 01:52:25,499
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with being adopted?

1505
01:52:25,519 --> 01:52:25,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

1506
01:52:27,248 --> 01:52:34,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the quality of this is rather shit, and it's really quiet, so I don't know if I should really play the whole thing, because it's not really coming through.

1507
01:52:35,957 --> 01:52:37,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I won't do that.

1508
01:52:37,338 --> 01:52:39,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me see if I can crank it up some other way.

1509
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:40,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on one sec, guys.

1510
01:52:40,922 --> 01:52:42,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio is tons of fun.

1511
01:52:43,825 --> 01:52:45,566
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have wave up as high as it'll go.

1512
01:52:45,987 --> 01:52:46,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get that any louder.

1513
01:52:47,548 --> 01:52:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: What a shit little...

1514
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play some of it.

1515
01:52:50,991 --> 01:52:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's too quiet.

1516
01:52:51,672 --> 01:52:52,252
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't hear it.

1517
01:52:54,214 --> 01:52:55,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go to YouTube.

1518
01:52:55,474 --> 01:52:56,455
[SPEAKER_04]: See if I can find it real quick.

1519
01:52:57,676 --> 01:52:58,697
[SPEAKER_04]: WBTV Portal 2.

1520
01:52:58,917 --> 01:52:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1521
01:52:59,277 --> 01:53:00,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Find Portal 2 being adopted.

1522
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to see if this works better.

1523
01:53:07,102 --> 01:53:10,164
[SPEAKER_00]: We have discovered a popular video game making fun of adoption.

1524
01:53:10,405 --> 01:53:15,668
[SPEAKER_00]: And tonight, a father is shocked at the insensitivity he says he witnessed.

1525
01:53:15,908 --> 01:53:16,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the clip.

1526
01:53:17,446 --> 01:53:18,988
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with being adopted?

1527
01:53:19,188 --> 01:53:22,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, um, lack of parents.

1528
01:53:25,953 --> 01:53:29,476
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is called Portal 2, and it's only been available for about a month.

1529
01:53:29,836 --> 01:53:34,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Regina Mack just talked to the father who shared this, who saw this with his daughter.

1530
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:37,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet he was shocked and really surprised by something like this.

1531
01:53:37,543 --> 01:53:41,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no idea, particularly because this is a game that builds itself as educational.

1532
01:53:42,207 --> 01:53:43,908
[SPEAKER_10]: It's rated E for everyone.

1533
01:53:43,989 --> 01:53:49,533
[SPEAKER_10]: As we said, Neil Staple was playing the game with his 10-year-old adopted daughter when they saw the clip tonight.

1534
01:53:49,854 --> 01:53:53,417
[SPEAKER_10]: He says he and his wife are still searching for a way to try to explain it.

1535
01:53:55,209 --> 01:53:55,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know what to do.

1536
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I still don't know what to do.

1537
01:53:57,211 --> 01:54:08,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Neil Staples still can't believe what he heard while playing the video game Portal 2 with his 10-year-old adopted daughter Zoe.

1538
01:54:09,422 --> 01:54:12,345
[SPEAKER_04]: They really do make this look pretty terrible, I gotta admit.

1539
01:54:12,385 --> 01:54:15,087
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, I feel like this is, like, really taken out of context.

1540
01:54:15,688 --> 01:54:16,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1541
01:54:16,468 --> 01:54:16,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, like...

1542
01:54:17,489 --> 01:54:21,331
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to remember, they're taunting everything about her.

1543
01:54:21,792 --> 01:54:23,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, no matter what it is.

1544
01:54:23,132 --> 01:54:26,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I don't think they ever really proved that she's adopted.

1545
01:54:26,734 --> 01:54:26,914
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1546
01:54:27,315 --> 01:54:28,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

1547
01:54:28,295 --> 01:54:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I just kind of feel like this is really selective hearing.

1548
01:54:31,936 --> 01:54:33,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my biggest issue of what's going on here.

1549
01:54:33,477 --> 01:54:38,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But I watch this news report and I go, wow, this game's fucking rude.

1550
01:54:38,539 --> 01:54:41,160
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've played through the game and I didn't get that impression at all.

1551
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,441
[SPEAKER_13]: It's E10+.

1552
01:54:42,461 --> 01:54:46,242
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a baseline E for everyone.

1553
01:54:46,923 --> 01:54:53,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, the 10-year-old daughter, since she's not 10+, she's 10, probably shouldn't have been watching.

1554
01:54:53,785 --> 01:54:54,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's 10 and over.

1555
01:54:55,612 --> 01:54:56,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not over 10.

1556
01:54:56,273 --> 01:54:57,275
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn you, Loki.

1557
01:54:57,295 --> 01:54:58,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You always gotta fucking disagree with me.

1558
01:54:58,657 --> 01:54:59,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear that?

1559
01:54:59,819 --> 01:55:04,627
[SPEAKER_10]: The character in the popular kids video game is actually taunted for being adopted.

1560
01:55:04,967 --> 01:55:06,189
[SPEAKER_09]: It literally pokes fun...

1561
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:13,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, and you literally proved that you're an idiot.

1562
01:55:14,117 --> 01:55:14,738
[SPEAKER_09]: She's Chinese.

1563
01:55:14,798 --> 01:55:16,880
[SPEAKER_09]: She obviously doesn't look like us.

1564
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:25,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It throws the question, the most ultimate question that that child is ever going to have for you.

1565
01:55:28,211 --> 01:55:29,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just throws her right in the living room.

1566
01:55:30,206 --> 01:55:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he going to cry?

1567
01:55:31,947 --> 01:55:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I really needed attention.

1568
01:55:34,347 --> 01:55:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I contacted the news, because I needed attention, because I'm an idiot.

1569
01:55:38,988 --> 01:55:39,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1570
01:55:39,569 --> 01:55:40,289
[SPEAKER_10]: But he'd heard.

1571
01:55:40,309 --> 01:55:50,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Neil immediately cut the game off, hoping Zoe hadn't heard the cruel joke from a video game billed as educational and appropriate for everyone 10 and up.

1572
01:55:50,411 --> 01:55:52,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says rated E for everybody.

1573
01:55:53,371 --> 01:55:56,537
[SPEAKER_07]: and I was thinking maybe it's rated E for everybody except for orphans.

1574
01:55:56,918 --> 01:56:00,124
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not an adoptive parent, it's probably not that big a deal to you.

1575
01:56:01,026 --> 01:56:05,254
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are an adoptive parent, it was literally the worst thing I could possibly have heard.

1576
01:56:05,962 --> 01:56:07,403
[SPEAKER_07]: But did Zoe hear it?

1577
01:56:08,024 --> 01:56:13,628
[SPEAKER_07]: She's sticking to her guns that she didn't hear it and to me that message means she's not ready to talk about it and I'm not going to force it.

1578
01:56:13,889 --> 01:56:14,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1579
01:56:14,869 --> 01:56:17,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Eyes rolling too much.

1580
01:56:18,352 --> 01:56:25,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Neil says they steer clear of that part of the game and hope their daughter never feels like she's any less because she's adopted.

1581
01:56:25,959 --> 01:56:27,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine my life without her.

1582
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:31,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she's just such an awesome child.

1583
01:56:32,104 --> 01:56:34,305
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just made our lives so much better.

1584
01:56:35,486 --> 01:56:37,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Now again, we did say this game was edgy.

1585
01:56:37,688 --> 01:56:39,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely there'll be a counterpoint to this, right?

1586
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:43,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, surely they tried to reach out to Valve for comment, right?

1587
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:46,896
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because you have to sort of figure out a way to get out of every single room.

1588
01:56:47,156 --> 01:56:49,598
[SPEAKER_10]: We did contact Sony, who distributes the game.

1589
01:56:49,939 --> 01:56:53,882
[SPEAKER_10]: They told us to contact Valve, the company that actually created the game.

1590
01:56:54,242 --> 01:56:54,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

1591
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:56,164
[SPEAKER_10]: We have not heard back from them.

1592
01:56:56,184 --> 01:56:58,606
[SPEAKER_10]: They're passing the buck onto somebody else.

1593
01:56:58,886 --> 01:56:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh!

1594
01:56:59,967 --> 01:57:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch!

1595
01:57:00,707 --> 01:57:01,868
[SPEAKER_10]: That is so not the way it works.

1596
01:57:01,888 --> 01:57:04,168
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, Sony doesn't distribute the game.

1597
01:57:04,248 --> 01:57:06,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It's EA that distributes the game, idiot.

1598
01:57:07,489 --> 01:57:11,391
[SPEAKER_13]: God, you're fucking... Send me the link to that place because I'm going to type one hell of a rebuttal.

1599
01:57:11,891 --> 01:57:13,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

1600
01:57:13,811 --> 01:57:19,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they didn't respond back to our claim, they're wrong.

1601
01:57:19,493 --> 01:57:29,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Having interned in local news as long as I did, I mean, I know this means a lot, but by trying to contact them, they probably gave a couple hours tops.

1602
01:57:29,716 --> 01:57:31,638
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1603
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:59,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched that piece and I agree, Portal looks pretty fucked up.

1604
01:57:59,629 --> 01:58:03,517
[SPEAKER_13]: The website is WBTV.com Email them all.

1605
01:58:03,777 --> 01:58:04,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Email them, please.

1606
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:05,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Email them.

1607
01:58:06,443 --> 01:58:25,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I think honestly the part that they kind of leave out that kind of irritates me is that if you're going to play that game with your kid you kind of have to be able to explain it all to them and you have to explain that these characters will mock anything to try that's what GLaDOS does she mocks everything what's next is somebody going to be upset because the game called them fat

1608
01:58:27,406 --> 01:58:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just a little silly

1609
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:46,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I actually am going to email them.

1610
01:58:46,631 --> 01:58:48,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was my story, so... Loki.

1611
01:59:13,551 --> 01:59:13,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

1612
01:59:15,752 --> 01:59:17,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not complaining about that kind of stuff.

1613
01:59:18,613 --> 01:59:24,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Ubisoft, you know, they're looking at maybe taking the next step with some of their franchises.

1614
01:59:24,595 --> 01:59:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of leaving it in the hands of people that may not be able to do their franchises well in the motion picture world, they're going to go ahead and form...

1615
01:59:33,699 --> 01:59:43,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Ubisoft Motion Pictures They're going to adapt some of their biggest properties Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Ghost Recon into 3D features

1616
01:59:46,148 --> 02:00:04,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very disappointed though that Rabbids were not part of that Because honestly I think that would work much better as a 3D animated feature than some of this stuff But whatever They said in addition to the trio of feature projects, the studio is reportedly developing 3D CGI animated series Oh, they are!

1617
02:00:04,803 --> 02:00:06,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the Rabbids properties, awesome!

1618
02:00:08,326 --> 02:00:11,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So they comprise of 78 episodes, 7 minutes a piece.

1619
02:00:12,888 --> 02:00:15,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like they're little trailers that they have.

1620
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:17,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1621
02:00:18,171 --> 02:00:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously though, they should get their own full length theater or theatrical movie.

1622
02:00:23,854 --> 02:00:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't be any worse than some of the other stuff I've seen.

1623
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:26,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1624
02:00:28,762 --> 02:00:29,103
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1625
02:00:29,863 --> 02:00:30,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1626
02:00:30,404 --> 02:00:33,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, two other quick E3-related stories.

1627
02:00:33,787 --> 02:00:34,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Konami.

1628
02:00:34,768 --> 02:00:37,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this was brought up earlier in the show, but let's just throw it out there.

1629
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:41,094
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to be doing their E3 press conference a little bit early this year.

1630
02:00:41,934 --> 02:00:46,539
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be doing their press conference, I believe it is the Sunday beforehand.

1631
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1632
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:49,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on...

1633
02:00:51,981 --> 02:01:01,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-E3 show 2011, and it is happening... Is there really a press release that doesn't have the fucking time of the event in here?

1634
02:01:03,049 --> 02:01:07,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami today announced the venue picks for the company's first annual global pre-E3 show 2011.

1635
02:01:08,092 --> 02:01:08,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1636
02:01:13,504 --> 02:01:14,724
[SPEAKER_04]: at the times listed below.

1637
02:01:31,169 --> 02:01:34,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so they're going to be doing their press conference on the Thursday beforehand.

1638
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:37,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Give bloggers and people a chance to talk about it.

1639
02:01:37,551 --> 02:01:39,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can attend live if you want.

1640
02:01:39,811 --> 02:01:47,174
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to actually be renting places in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, Sao Paulo, Mexico City.

1641
02:01:47,274 --> 02:01:48,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're getting international with this.

1642
02:01:48,894 --> 02:01:52,797
[SPEAKER_03]: See now, my only thing about this though is they said it's like live viewing parties.

1643
02:01:52,997 --> 02:01:56,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Now are they just watching the press conference or are they actually going to be able to play games there and stuff?

1644
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:57,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1645
02:01:58,061 --> 02:01:59,002
[SPEAKER_04]: They aren't really saying.

1646
02:01:59,102 --> 02:02:01,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it sound like they're just going to be able to watch.

1647
02:02:02,345 --> 02:02:05,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you'll just get to be able to watch this.

1648
02:02:06,168 --> 02:02:09,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can register online for a chance to attend.

1649
02:02:11,251 --> 02:02:14,113
[SPEAKER_04]: The place here in San Francisco they're going to be doing at is Temple Nightclub.

1650
02:02:14,533 --> 02:02:17,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not familiar with that place, but I imagine it's at 4 o'clock.

1651
02:02:17,334 --> 02:02:18,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of early.

1652
02:02:18,494 --> 02:02:23,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But they probably have to pick a time like that because 4 o'clock would be 7 o'clock on the East Coast.

1653
02:02:23,516 --> 02:02:24,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And what time would that be in Japan?

1654
02:02:24,857 --> 02:02:26,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be 8 a.m.

1655
02:02:27,018 --> 02:02:27,818
[SPEAKER_04]: the next day, I think.

1656
02:02:28,183 --> 02:02:31,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that's why they're doing it at that time.

1657
02:02:31,687 --> 02:02:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1658
02:02:32,528 --> 02:02:36,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they're doing a pre-E3 show 2011 and talking about these venues they picked.

1659
02:02:37,013 --> 02:02:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So facebook.com slash Konami if you want to go to the viewing event or you can just watch it online.

1660
02:02:43,812 --> 02:02:46,074
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1661
02:03:04,591 --> 02:03:10,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is a little weird, because G4, don't they have the exclusive E3 pass or whatever?

1662
02:03:10,912 --> 02:03:15,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually they do for, I know they've done Microsoft's conference in the past.

1663
02:03:15,873 --> 02:03:21,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, though, the press conferences aren't a part of E3, so that's why Spike probably paid money for it.

1664
02:03:22,794 --> 02:03:23,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

1665
02:03:24,255 --> 02:03:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So, everybody's going to be able to watch that live, as long as you have basic cable.

1666
02:03:27,555 --> 02:03:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I'm sure it'll be streamed over Justin TV everywhere, so check that out.

1667
02:03:33,655 --> 02:03:36,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, with that, let's go to the mailbag.

1668
02:03:36,416 --> 02:03:37,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1669
02:03:38,297 --> 02:03:41,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

1670
02:03:42,879 --> 02:03:48,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura is going to dive in the mailbag headfirst and find some emails to read for us today.

1671
02:03:49,318 --> 02:03:50,099
[SPEAKER_13]: First email.

1672
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:51,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Greetings, OLR.

1673
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:52,381
[SPEAKER_13]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1674
02:03:52,821 --> 02:03:54,963
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no game-related comments or questions this week.

1675
02:03:55,003 --> 02:04:00,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to send hearts your way and say that OLR is the best and only gaming podcast that I currently listen to.

1676
02:04:01,509 --> 02:04:05,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And whoever is responsible for putting the podcast up on the internet says doing an awesome job.

1677
02:04:06,133 --> 02:04:06,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1678
02:04:06,553 --> 02:04:10,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I literally don't allow myself to do anything else Sunday nights until the show is posted.

1679
02:04:24,588 --> 02:04:32,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, the other thing that made it a lot easier, I changed the way I write descriptions, so I don't actually have to think of a sassy commentary on what happened during the show.

1680
02:04:32,973 --> 02:04:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I just basically post the first five stories from the show roll, and then that's it.

1681
02:04:36,995 --> 02:04:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's reading the descriptions?

1682
02:04:38,396 --> 02:04:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Our subscribers?

1683
02:04:40,577 --> 02:04:41,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they really read the description.

1684
02:04:41,938 --> 02:04:45,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong, but in the interest of getting it up faster, I just...

1685
02:04:47,321 --> 02:05:12,570
[SPEAKER_04]: and we don't edit the show either I mean I have to edit it to take out the middle part where we play copyright music and just clean up the beginning and end but as for like the actual content in the middle it's live radio we don't really edit like something has to go really really wrong or somebody has to say something really really bad for us to edit and I don't remember I haven't edited any content out in easily a year at least so

1686
02:05:13,846 --> 02:05:18,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess this doesn't really apply to you anymore, Rob, since I know you've got the trial.

1687
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:23,713
[SPEAKER_13]: But Holly D sent an invite and said any of us can use it to play Rift.

1688
02:05:25,955 --> 02:05:29,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's been pimping out on Horde House on the forums over there.

1689
02:05:29,417 --> 02:05:33,620
[SPEAKER_04]: She's desperate to get her Corgi and the other little rewards that she can get, so...

1690
02:05:34,724 --> 02:05:36,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's there.

1691
02:05:36,405 --> 02:05:39,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll look at it, but I really can't.

1692
02:05:39,327 --> 02:05:39,887
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no time.

1693
02:05:39,927 --> 02:05:41,328
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you liking Rift?

1694
02:05:42,709 --> 02:05:44,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to plead the fifth until later.

1695
02:05:44,930 --> 02:05:45,270
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1696
02:05:47,311 --> 02:05:51,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say without a doubt, though, that it is better than Final Fantasy XIV.

1697
02:05:52,454 --> 02:05:52,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1698
02:05:53,155 --> 02:05:53,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1699
02:05:55,556 --> 02:05:58,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I was still writing my angry email to WBTV.

1700
02:05:58,238 --> 02:05:58,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1701
02:05:59,011 --> 02:06:00,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, we have another one from Holly.

1702
02:06:28,181 --> 02:06:32,664
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, but you gotta admit, there's a ton of people doing it out of being purely fickle.

1703
02:06:33,724 --> 02:06:35,545
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of people, there's just, that's how people are.

1704
02:06:36,205 --> 02:06:37,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I can understand it.

1705
02:06:37,166 --> 02:06:47,552
[SPEAKER_13]: For every, you know, one person who's got true, authentic integrity and turning it in, there's gonna be 25 other that are gonna just be, I'm telling you.

1706
02:06:48,572 --> 02:06:48,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

1707
02:06:49,853 --> 02:06:51,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, okay, to continue.

1708
02:06:51,034 --> 02:06:51,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's...

1709
02:06:51,954 --> 02:06:53,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I say this real quick though?

1710
02:06:55,275 --> 02:06:58,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's where the line is between fickle and yeah, I meant it.

1711
02:06:59,496 --> 02:07:05,437
[SPEAKER_04]: When a game like The Last Guardian comes out, are you going to rebuy a PS3 if you sold yours back?

1712
02:07:06,077 --> 02:07:09,698
[SPEAKER_04]: If you mean it and you stick to your guns, then you know what?

1713
02:07:09,718 --> 02:07:10,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You have every right.

1714
02:07:10,558 --> 02:07:11,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your money.

1715
02:07:11,138 --> 02:07:12,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You should spend it on what you want.

1716
02:07:13,659 --> 02:07:14,100
[SPEAKER_04]: To continue?

1717
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:14,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1718
02:07:30,652 --> 02:07:31,573
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1719
02:07:49,725 --> 02:07:52,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I stopped playing WoW because of something Blizzard did that I find unacceptable.

1720
02:07:53,267 --> 02:07:54,648
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter that I like the game.

1721
02:07:54,688 --> 02:08:00,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to put money into a company that treats its customers badly and I really feel this is why people are abandoning ship on Sony.

1722
02:08:00,672 --> 02:08:11,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Holly D. Like I said, I think that for every one person that's got a legitimate reason with actual integrity behind it, the rest of them are sheeping.

1723
02:08:13,099 --> 02:08:30,079
[SPEAKER_04]: you know and I would fully admit there's been times I really would want to leave Blizzard but I kind of feel like I'd be being one of those fickle people like I just go right back six months later when that patch comes out that I really want to play so I don't know it's tough when you stick to your guns that's pretty admirable

1724
02:08:30,739 --> 02:08:31,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

1725
02:08:53,087 --> 02:08:56,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and no, I'm not, don't hear me wrong.

1726
02:08:56,129 --> 02:09:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not knocking vegans, but there are some people who like do it for a couple weeks and they're like, this is too hard.

1727
02:09:02,694 --> 02:09:04,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to go back to eating chicken, you know?

1728
02:09:05,015 --> 02:09:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

1729
02:09:09,278 --> 02:09:11,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I personally, I've tried to go vegetarian.

1730
02:09:11,319 --> 02:09:11,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it.

1731
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even go vegetarian.

1732
02:09:13,721 --> 02:09:14,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too hard.

1733
02:09:14,281 --> 02:09:15,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get enough protein.

1734
02:09:16,849 --> 02:09:40,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I know how to get protein, I just still wasn't getting enough of it Anyway, I don't know when I just started comparing Blizzard to being a vegetarian, but okay Next email Hello guys, first of all, congratulations on your awesome show I listen to it at work and it makes my hours go by faster I would like your opinion on these two topics One, games with poor or no control configuration options Yeah, that sucks

1735
02:09:41,903 --> 02:09:44,105
[SPEAKER_13]: and games that don't allow you to pause the cutscenes.

1736
02:09:44,586 --> 02:09:45,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you and good luck with your show.

1737
02:09:46,327 --> 02:09:51,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's from... I'll just say... Cadius.

1738
02:09:54,089 --> 02:10:15,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish the emailer had given us some specific examples of games like I know there are games like that that don't have the custom and I know I've gone on this tangent on the show before like games that have the really whack controls that you just can't recustomize and yet now I'm drawing a total blank like I can't remember any of them I'm sure a chat room will help us out here this is why I love having a live chat

1739
02:10:16,817 --> 02:10:19,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And then cutscenes, yeah, that's kind of annoying.

1740
02:10:19,579 --> 02:10:21,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Or unskippable ones, too.

1741
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mortal Kombat, story mode, it's pretty cool.

1742
02:10:25,222 --> 02:10:27,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can pause cutscenes, but you can't skip them.

1743
02:10:30,704 --> 02:10:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: unless it's your second time playing through which I think is really weird because what I don't like is that in Mortal Kombat if you are stuck on a certain part you have to keep watching the cutscene leading up to it over and over until you beat it if you turn off the game because if you just hit retry you don't have to watch the whole thing over and over but like sometimes I get so frustrated I need to walk away for a little bit and then come back and the last thing I want to do when I come back is watch the cutscene again so yeah

1744
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:02,282
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, Xenocore says no vegan diet, no vegan powers.

1745
02:11:02,302 --> 02:11:04,324
[SPEAKER_13]: I loved that whole scene.

1746
02:11:04,364 --> 02:11:05,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's from Scott Pilgrim, huh?

1747
02:11:05,685 --> 02:11:05,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1748
02:11:06,245 --> 02:11:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

1749
02:11:08,707 --> 02:11:08,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1750
02:11:11,048 --> 02:11:12,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving forward.

1751
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:13,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, OLA crew.

1752
02:11:13,951 --> 02:11:14,331
[SPEAKER_13]: This is...

1753
02:11:16,102 --> 02:11:20,885
[SPEAKER_13]: and Ramadija, I guess that's how I hope I pronounce it right, a blind gamer from Indonesia.

1754
02:11:21,606 --> 02:11:26,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I sent you some emails a long time ago and this email will absolutely be the sign that I'm still following you until now.

1755
02:11:27,069 --> 02:11:27,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Great show as always.

1756
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:36,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I cannot contribute my thoughts like the other listeners because I cannot play games like others do, I hope I can still be part of OLR's discussion with my personal thought about video games.

1757
02:11:37,396 --> 02:11:43,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I consider myself as one of the veteran gamers because when I was a child, video games were so easy to be played even without my sight.

1758
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, can I interrupt for real quick?

1759
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:45,502
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the name of the emailer again?

1760
02:11:47,542 --> 02:11:48,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Ramadija?

1761
02:11:48,303 --> 02:11:51,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the same person that sent the Scars of Time flute thing?

1762
02:11:51,663 --> 02:11:52,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

1763
02:11:52,423 --> 02:11:52,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1764
02:11:53,104 --> 02:11:59,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, like, don't invalidate your opinion just because you have, like, a challenge.

1765
02:12:00,065 --> 02:12:07,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, in watching what you did with the Scars of Time thing, clearly you have a love and passion for video games.

1766
02:12:07,847 --> 02:12:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So that makes you just as much of a gamer as anybody else with just as much a right to your opinion as anyone else.

1767
02:12:12,408 --> 02:12:13,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throwing that out there.

1768
02:12:13,868 --> 02:12:14,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1769
02:12:14,568 --> 02:12:14,868
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1770
02:12:31,036 --> 02:12:58,808
[SPEAKER_13]: so I would like to share the enjoyment I've gotten several months ago it was when I found the Angry Video Game Nerd I love Angry Video Game Nerd and imported the DVDs from the author I don't know if any one of you ever heard about AVGN it's a series of classic video games featuring James as a nerd that plays old video games actually he reviewed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the DVD sets recently and it was hilarious but my favorite that he does is the Friday the 13th review so funny anyway

1771
02:13:00,737 --> 02:13:04,523
[SPEAKER_13]: He reviews the negative sides of games with badass style.

1772
02:13:04,903 --> 02:13:08,088
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see and hear a lot of fucks and shits in there, beer included.

1773
02:13:08,789 --> 02:13:11,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Just Google it or go to Wikipedia for more information.

1774
02:13:13,696 --> 02:13:14,397
[SPEAKER_13]: He linked a video.

1775
02:13:17,834 --> 02:13:27,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to share it because this show is very enjoyable for me even without my ability to see what's happening on screen I don't know what will happen to me if I am not blind and able to watch those

1776
02:13:37,900 --> 02:14:01,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe you all can find some amusement there too now on to me like I said that I am blind so I cannot play video games the same like others but I do enjoy online games text based and right now I'm playing Blade of Eternity and the link is bladeofeternity.com and reach level 148 besides I do enjoy video game music and I love playing some of them using my flute just go to my YouTube channel it is the same guy yeah

1777
02:14:02,663 --> 02:14:04,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to spell it out.

1778
02:14:04,864 --> 02:14:08,525
[SPEAKER_13]: R-A-M-A-D-I-T-Y-A Skywalker and watch.

1779
02:14:08,685 --> 02:14:11,286
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite is when I played Scars of Time from Chrono Cross.

1780
02:14:11,986 --> 02:14:12,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's all from me.

1781
02:14:13,046 --> 02:14:16,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope this email can be read and I will get more friends to talk about video games.

1782
02:14:16,387 --> 02:14:20,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I only have a few local friends that understand English and stuff I like anyway.

1783
02:14:20,829 --> 02:14:24,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheers from, and I hope I'm pronouncing it right, Ramaditya.

1784
02:14:24,330 --> 02:14:26,450
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's Ramaditya.

1785
02:14:26,470 --> 02:14:27,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I said it too, yeah.

1786
02:14:28,671 --> 02:14:29,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.

1787
02:14:30,612 --> 02:14:31,813
[SPEAKER_13]: That's very sweet.

1788
02:14:32,673 --> 02:14:34,114
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the Angry Video Game Nerds corruption.

1789
02:14:34,594 --> 02:14:34,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Hater.

1790
02:14:36,215 --> 02:14:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole nother layer, but I'm not going to get into it.

1791
02:14:39,717 --> 02:14:40,518
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

1792
02:14:41,478 --> 02:14:41,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1793
02:14:43,339 --> 02:14:46,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually has nothing to do with that show specifically.

1794
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:47,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that makes no sense at all.

1795
02:14:48,482 --> 02:14:48,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the dude.

1796
02:14:49,392 --> 02:14:50,653
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1797
02:14:51,033 --> 02:14:52,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I'll tell you another day.

1798
02:14:52,895 --> 02:14:53,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1799
02:14:54,156 --> 02:14:54,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, all.

1800
02:14:55,077 --> 02:14:56,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's another one from Holly.

1801
02:14:57,879 --> 02:14:59,561
[SPEAKER_13]: No offense, Holly, you email us a lot.

1802
02:15:00,502 --> 02:15:00,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, all.

1803
02:15:00,962 --> 02:15:03,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't panic too much, but SE just got hacked too.

1804
02:15:03,224 --> 02:15:10,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I was ready to flip out having played Final Fantasy XI, but it turns out that they only got email addresses unless you're a Canadian.

1805
02:15:10,931 --> 02:15:14,013
[SPEAKER_13]: They got resumes for 350 Canadian potential employees too.

1806
02:15:18,102 --> 02:15:18,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Holly.

1807
02:15:19,283 --> 02:15:20,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the last one.

1808
02:15:20,664 --> 02:15:22,466
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I did hear about that.

1809
02:15:23,187 --> 02:15:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, somebody needs to catch these hackers.

1810
02:15:25,068 --> 02:15:28,852
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, these hackers are going to get too bold.

1811
02:15:29,172 --> 02:15:32,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me warn you, because this might not be the same person that's doing the Sony stuff.

1812
02:15:32,915 --> 02:15:34,136
[SPEAKER_03]: How much bolder can you get?

1813
02:15:34,356 --> 02:15:35,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know, right?

1814
02:15:35,598 --> 02:15:41,503
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is, one of these days, hacker, you're going to get sloppy.

1815
02:15:43,366 --> 02:15:51,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't matter which video game website you get caught hacking, you're going to get blamed for the Sony thing by the mass media.

1816
02:15:51,991 --> 02:16:02,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't believe me, go watch, go re-watch that zany local news report about Portal 2 to watch the way that the media will construe things to get a story.

1817
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:05,100
[SPEAKER_04]: They can say whatever they want.

1818
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:05,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1819
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:11,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you had nothing to do with the Sony hack, if you get caught hacking Square Enix's website, you'll be the Sony hacker.

1820
02:16:12,105 --> 02:16:12,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch.

1821
02:16:14,989 --> 02:16:15,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1822
02:16:16,492 --> 02:16:18,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand hackers gonna hack.

1823
02:16:18,755 --> 02:16:22,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always said on the show, I'm not trying to infringe on your freedom to hack.

1824
02:16:22,302 --> 02:16:22,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

1825
02:16:24,628 --> 02:16:25,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch it.

1826
02:16:25,689 --> 02:16:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And I shouldn't say your freedom to hack because whoever hacked the Sony website did a fucked up thing and that's not acceptable.

1827
02:16:30,751 --> 02:16:34,293
[SPEAKER_13]: You just totally made me think of Life of Brian.

1828
02:16:34,733 --> 02:16:40,437
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, well, you can't physically have babies, but we'll protect your right to have them.

1829
02:16:42,157 --> 02:16:42,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Eric Idle's character.

1830
02:16:43,078 --> 02:16:43,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1831
02:16:43,278 --> 02:16:45,519
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, so we'll protect your right to hack.

1832
02:16:45,619 --> 02:16:46,640
[SPEAKER_13]: You just can't hack.

1833
02:16:48,175 --> 02:16:48,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1834
02:16:49,495 --> 02:16:50,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Last one.

1835
02:16:50,856 --> 02:16:58,138
[SPEAKER_13]: There is still no taco delivery service on the PSN now that it is partially... Now that it is partially... It has a sad... Clearly this is an email written in all caps.

1836
02:16:59,699 --> 02:16:59,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1837
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:01,259
[SPEAKER_13]: That's from all caps Bobby.

1838
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:03,960
[SPEAKER_13]: All caps Bobby has a sad frown.

1839
02:17:05,021 --> 02:17:05,341
[SPEAKER_13]: The end.

1840
02:17:06,701 --> 02:17:07,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I saved it for last.

1841
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:12,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1842
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:14,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for emails.

1843
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:18,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us.

1844
02:17:18,204 --> 02:17:19,866
[SPEAKER_04]: But try to not use all caps.

1845
02:17:20,426 --> 02:17:22,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it when Jamie reads all caps emails.

1846
02:17:22,489 --> 02:17:22,749
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1847
02:17:23,349 --> 02:17:25,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how about you?

1848
02:17:26,664 --> 02:17:37,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, apparently the Fox Entertainment Group has an FCC filing that points to possibly a new video service coming to consoles.

1849
02:17:38,453 --> 02:17:50,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that Fox Entertainment Group and its multi-channel video programming distribution partners have shown intent that they're planning on broadening their platforms that they offer content on.

1850
02:17:51,082 --> 02:18:00,729
[SPEAKER_03]: and that it will see subscription and on-demand video services available directly to wide-marketed consumer electronics devices such as game consoles sometime in the near future.

1851
02:18:02,811 --> 02:18:09,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe something that will be announced later on, maybe something that's, you know, time of, like, a capable provider or something like that.

1852
02:18:10,016 --> 02:18:12,338
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to see.

1853
02:18:14,099 --> 02:18:14,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1854
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1855
02:18:16,529 --> 02:18:19,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we have enough video services on consoles at this point, though?

1856
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:19,350
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.

1857
02:18:19,370 --> 02:18:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot.

1858
02:18:19,971 --> 02:18:21,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Between Netflix and Hulu.

1859
02:18:21,931 --> 02:18:25,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Hulu Plus kind of sucks because of their ads.

1860
02:18:25,313 --> 02:18:29,054
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm not a fan of ads and paying for it.

1861
02:18:29,634 --> 02:18:30,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one or the other, not both.

1862
02:18:33,556 --> 02:18:35,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one other story for you guys tonight.

1863
02:18:35,717 --> 02:18:37,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to get into the Skype line.

1864
02:18:37,378 --> 02:18:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopee!

1865
02:18:38,599 --> 02:18:39,859
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1866
02:18:39,919 --> 02:18:40,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I lie.

1867
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:43,801
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week and then the Skype line.

1868
02:18:43,821 --> 02:18:45,142
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1869
02:18:45,182 --> 02:18:52,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, let me read this quick story about Kid Icarus Uprising, which of course is the 3DS Kid Icarus game that's coming out soon.

1870
02:18:53,806 --> 02:18:54,327
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1871
02:19:11,201 --> 02:19:24,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other stuff that's coming out of this though is that Nintendo is going to be using fan Miis on a float that will show up at the Goshogawara Tachi Neputa Festival that happens in August.

1872
02:19:25,206 --> 02:19:35,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Miis will be joining Pit and Patena and there's a whole page in Japanese on how you can create a Mii on your 3DS, save it and send it into Nintendo.

1873
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1874
02:20:05,942 --> 02:20:07,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So yay, me's on parade!

1875
02:20:07,903 --> 02:20:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!

1876
02:20:09,524 --> 02:20:12,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week before I forget.

1877
02:20:12,546 --> 02:20:14,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week on this show we do a little bit of ranting.

1878
02:20:29,935 --> 02:20:31,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to WBTV.

1879
02:20:32,748 --> 02:20:33,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Logi.

1880
02:20:49,605 --> 02:20:56,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to my new portable hard drive that's USB powered for deleting said data on portable hard drive.

1881
02:20:57,291 --> 02:20:57,892
[SPEAKER_03]: One I didn't want to.

1882
02:20:57,912 --> 02:20:59,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why is this not working?

1883
02:20:59,413 --> 02:21:00,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked on it.

1884
02:21:00,414 --> 02:21:01,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's empty.

1885
02:21:01,915 --> 02:21:03,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1886
02:21:04,257 --> 02:21:05,298
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's never doing that to me.

1887
02:21:06,118 --> 02:21:07,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I blame partly my 360.

1888
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:11,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to create a 360 data partition in it.

1889
02:21:11,623 --> 02:21:15,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really a data partition, but usually they'll do it without erasing any data.

1890
02:21:15,626 --> 02:21:16,627
[SPEAKER_03]: But it decided.

1891
02:21:17,007 --> 02:21:19,009
[SPEAKER_13]: But you used mine and mine was fine.

1892
02:21:19,795 --> 02:21:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but my 360 was being retarded and didn't want to see the drive until I did that.

1893
02:21:24,741 --> 02:21:25,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it finally sees the drive.

1894
02:21:26,062 --> 02:21:27,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, too bad.

1895
02:21:27,965 --> 02:21:28,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1896
02:21:30,788 --> 02:21:34,132
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to Loki because he doesn't like Lady Gaga.

1897
02:21:34,612 --> 02:21:35,173
[SPEAKER_04]: She's brilliant.

1898
02:21:37,075 --> 02:21:37,596
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a hater.

1899
02:21:39,597 --> 02:21:42,061
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's my FU of the week, then that means things are going pretty good.

1900
02:21:42,101 --> 02:21:43,584
[SPEAKER_04]: How about FU to Headaches?

1901
02:21:44,345 --> 02:21:48,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had a bad one yesterday and I kind of was antisocial at a party because of it and that's never any fun.

1902
02:21:48,873 --> 02:21:49,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like being antisocial.

1903
02:21:50,696 --> 02:21:51,137
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

1904
02:21:52,339 --> 02:21:53,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And then FU to Loki.

1905
02:21:53,516 --> 02:21:56,340
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the Skype line.

1906
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:59,984
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Every week we give you guys a chance to call in and share your voices.

1907
02:22:00,285 --> 02:22:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1908
02:22:00,645 --> 02:22:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's the same people that call every week, and that's fine.

1909
02:22:03,829 --> 02:22:05,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It's open for all right now.

1910
02:22:05,491 --> 02:22:08,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm actually really proud of this line, and I would like to read it from my email.

1911
02:22:08,094 --> 02:22:09,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, go ahead, because the phone's not ringing yet.

1912
02:22:09,336 --> 02:22:09,997
[SPEAKER_13]: It's item number five.

1913
02:22:10,377 --> 02:22:10,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1914
02:22:11,058 --> 02:22:12,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to hear my email so far?

1915
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sure, what the hell.

1916
02:22:14,380 --> 02:22:15,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm cutting you off as soon as the call comes in.

1917
02:22:16,081 --> 02:22:19,261
[SPEAKER_13]: To whom it may concern, first and foremost, I am an adult, a fan of video games, and female.

1918
02:22:19,341 --> 02:22:26,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I am friends with several adopted friends who were shocked you gave attention to the single person Okay.

1919
02:22:27,022 --> 02:22:28,163
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to rephrase that.

1920
02:22:28,263 --> 02:22:29,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, I've got friends that are adopted that play Portal.

1921
02:22:30,063 --> 02:22:30,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't care.

1922
02:22:30,483 --> 02:22:31,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1923
02:22:31,883 --> 02:22:35,544
[SPEAKER_13]: I said my friends play Portal too with me and think adoption jokes are just as funny.

1924
02:22:35,564 --> 02:22:37,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm cutting you off because you're getting a phone call.

1925
02:22:37,044 --> 02:22:41,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAVE-OLR Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1926
02:22:41,125 --> 02:22:41,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1927
02:22:42,085 --> 02:22:42,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is X-Link.

1928
02:22:42,926 --> 02:22:44,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, X-Link, how you doing?

1929
02:22:44,507 --> 02:22:45,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, doing good.

1930
02:22:45,327 --> 02:22:49,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to call in and chime in for a minute about Blizzard and their customer service.

1931
02:22:49,109 --> 02:23:01,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said they didn't like the way they were doing it, but actually, every time when I have talked to somebody through the customer service through very few problems I had, of course, playing WoW and whatnot, I had really good service, including an item that I ordered from their store.

1932
02:23:02,199 --> 02:23:02,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Do tell.

1933
02:23:02,779 --> 02:23:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Share a little more about your positive experience.

1934
02:23:05,221 --> 02:23:07,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we often have a lot of negativity.

1935
02:23:07,363 --> 02:23:08,283
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's hear something good.

1936
02:23:08,844 --> 02:23:10,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll talk about the store.

1937
02:23:11,205 --> 02:23:17,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow with my PayPal account, instead of putting the right address, which was on there, they somehow got my old address.

1938
02:23:18,130 --> 02:23:19,451
[SPEAKER_01]: This was before I moved.

1939
02:23:19,671 --> 02:23:21,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I got changed, I didn't realize it.

1940
02:23:21,613 --> 02:23:24,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized it the night after the order was placed.

1941
02:23:25,626 --> 02:23:54,635
[SPEAKER_01]: I called in but unfortunately the package had already shipped so they had to wait for it to try to be delivered and then they can cancel so they whoever was at the door thank god there was nobody there living there in my old apartment at the time so it got sent back to them but they were they not only replaced the old package with a new one but they also refunded the money to my account which I thought was a little odd but hey it was you know so I technically got the item for free but

1942
02:23:55,802 --> 02:24:11,352
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy who walked me through and tried to help me as much as he could, not only did he do it through the phone in a very positive and nice fashion, but also kept up with quarterly, like almost every few hours by email, which was very nice.

1943
02:24:11,632 --> 02:24:14,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, he did flood the mailbox like every three to four hours.

1944
02:24:14,193 --> 02:24:18,256
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one email in the morning, one email in the evening saying, here's what we got.

1945
02:24:18,276 --> 02:24:19,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what we're going to do.

1946
02:24:19,957 --> 02:24:20,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what the game is.

1947
02:24:20,597 --> 02:24:21,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So constant communication.

1948
02:24:21,898 --> 02:24:21,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1949
02:24:22,378 --> 02:24:22,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

1950
02:24:37,641 --> 02:24:39,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not okay for the two lines to be crossed.

1951
02:24:40,083 --> 02:24:42,985
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I trained for nine years in customer service.

1952
02:24:43,025 --> 02:24:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I trained for a large, large call center here in the area on customer service.

1953
02:24:47,148 --> 02:24:53,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you, one of the things that we were really big on was making sure that information was always communicated to the customer.

1954
02:24:53,552 --> 02:25:02,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Communication is so key, I think, because people don't call into places or email or whatever to hear, I don't know, or there's nothing we can do about that.

1955
02:25:03,178 --> 02:25:04,379
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it resolution.

1956
02:25:04,599 --> 02:25:06,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you pick up the phone and call somebody in the first place.

1957
02:25:08,082 --> 02:25:30,400
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was it was really cool because he's like yes sir no sir and he had a very positive attitude it's like it's like almost that he was like talking to my talk to like a best friend or a good friend about something he's like yeah you know hey it happens you know no problem let me look into it uh hey what's the got place to unfold um i promise i'll be right back and if i don't i got your information right here i'll call you right back and we'll walk we'll try to see what we can do

1958
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:47,092
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was very nice and a lot of companies most times when you call it's kind of like I don't care I'm just going to do it's more robotic and you know it's like why did I do this in the first place when I'm just going to do this through email and just probably get the same response so

1959
02:25:47,884 --> 02:25:52,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look, I don't know what Holly's thing is with Blizzard right now.

1960
02:25:52,387 --> 02:25:53,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know specifically.

1961
02:25:53,188 --> 02:25:56,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I might, but I wouldn't try to tell it on the show for somebody else anyway.

1962
02:25:57,090 --> 02:25:59,872
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell you where I come from.

1963
02:26:00,933 --> 02:26:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we play WoW together.

1964
02:26:02,214 --> 02:26:03,074
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I love WoW.

1965
02:26:04,195 --> 02:26:07,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have a fucking podcast about WoW if I didn't love World of Warcraft.

1966
02:26:07,417 --> 02:26:15,222
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes I get a little negative on Horde House because Blizzard just makes these decisions as a corporation that you just look at it and your jaw is just dropped.

1967
02:26:15,242 --> 02:26:16,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what the fuck are you doing?

1968
02:26:17,964 --> 02:26:18,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give you an analogy.

1969
02:26:18,744 --> 02:26:19,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

1970
02:26:19,105 --> 02:26:19,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give you an analogy.

1971
02:26:20,205 --> 02:26:25,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, like let's assume you've got a friend and like, you know, this is your bro.

1972
02:26:25,248 --> 02:26:26,348
[SPEAKER_04]: He's your guy.

1973
02:26:26,628 --> 02:26:29,310
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of your best friends, you know, whatever.

1974
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:37,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly this guy starts dating this girl and you just don't like her because she's drama and she just –

1975
02:26:38,154 --> 02:26:38,414
[SPEAKER_04]: ActaVision

1976
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:17,032
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been times when I've seen some of the stuff they're supposedly going to do inside the game, and I'm looking at the stuff and announcements, I'm like, what the fuck are they doing with this shit?

1977
02:27:17,112 --> 02:27:21,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, are they going to actually make us pay for all this stuff that should be free in the first place?

1978
02:27:22,497 --> 02:27:28,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love listening to other people's, also other people's podcasts, of course, I listen to yours too, Rob.

1979
02:27:28,894 --> 02:27:58,230
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's kind of funny hearing that people come up like you would say something and you'd be like okay I can't believe Blizzard's doing this what the fuck and then somebody else on the same line going you know what I think Blizzard's going overboard with this and this is stupid and I can't believe they're actually doing this because they're trying to get more money into the pot so to speak so I think they could do a lot of this stuff or you know everything doesn't have to be quote unquote a premium fee I think that's taking a little overboard

1980
02:27:58,490 --> 02:28:03,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what's funny is that, yet again, we have a case of the worker bee is doing a great job.

1981
02:28:03,434 --> 02:28:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And the worker bee, in this case, being the customer service reps you interact with.

1982
02:28:06,496 --> 02:28:08,097
[SPEAKER_04]: They're representing their company very well.

1983
02:28:08,358 --> 02:28:11,920
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem, when we talk about issues we have with Blizzard, it is not with the worker bees.

1984
02:28:12,441 --> 02:28:13,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's with the queen bee.

1985
02:28:13,982 --> 02:28:16,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's with the people up top that are making the decisions.

1986
02:28:16,364 --> 02:28:17,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just... Don't hit your head.

1987
02:28:17,945 --> 02:28:18,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

1988
02:28:19,706 --> 02:28:20,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Face palm.

1989
02:28:20,867 --> 02:28:23,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me that picture of Captain Jean-Luc Picard face palming.

1990
02:28:23,989 --> 02:28:24,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's...

1991
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:27,975
[SPEAKER_04]: God, half the stories I read on Horde House need that caption.

1992
02:28:28,857 --> 02:28:30,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Any MMO Any MMO goes through this

1993
02:28:57,669 --> 02:29:06,948
[SPEAKER_04]: and WoW just happens to be a big one but any MMO goes through this love-hate relationship with their fanbase, my god, look at Final Fantasy XIV right now, hello like the same problem

1994
02:29:07,677 --> 02:29:08,117
[SPEAKER_04]: What, Rob?

1995
02:29:08,237 --> 02:29:08,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Final what?

1996
02:29:08,997 --> 02:29:09,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

1997
02:29:10,538 --> 02:29:11,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1998
02:29:11,818 --> 02:29:12,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.

1999
02:29:13,378 --> 02:29:15,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I got to wrap up so we can get more calls.

2000
02:29:15,839 --> 02:29:16,539
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you so much.

2001
02:29:16,619 --> 02:29:17,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything really quick.

2002
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:18,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quick.

2003
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:18,880
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

2004
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,000
[SPEAKER_04]: No, anything else real quick you want to get out?

2005
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:21,420
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

2006
02:29:21,541 --> 02:29:21,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing else.

2007
02:29:22,141 --> 02:29:22,641
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then bye.

2008
02:29:24,101 --> 02:29:25,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to read you the line that I'm proud of.

2009
02:29:25,822 --> 02:29:26,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, go for it.

2010
02:29:26,562 --> 02:29:26,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2011
02:29:27,202 --> 02:29:27,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I hang up?

2012
02:29:27,802 --> 02:29:28,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I hung up.

2013
02:29:28,542 --> 02:29:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2014
02:29:29,483 --> 02:29:29,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang up.

2015
02:29:30,343 --> 02:29:30,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang up.

2016
02:29:34,222 --> 02:29:34,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I hang up?

2017
02:29:34,942 --> 02:29:40,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2018
02:29:40,446 --> 02:29:41,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2019
02:29:41,387 --> 02:29:44,929
[SPEAKER_13]: The character in the game is, as admitted by one of the other antagonists, a moron.

2020
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:51,834
[SPEAKER_13]: The same antagonist is a passive-aggressive homicidal computer that takes steps to discourage the character being played, not the player.

2021
02:29:52,234 --> 02:29:56,277
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also insults slung out towards overweight people and those of lower than average intelligence.

2022
02:29:56,917 --> 02:29:58,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Should they also rise up in protest?

2023
02:29:58,858 --> 02:30:02,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Should the fatties and morons also call your station and expect the same coverage as the adoptive parents?

2024
02:30:05,919 --> 02:30:12,626
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that's a very good point that the story overlooks, is that the character is supposed to be a moron.

2025
02:30:13,767 --> 02:30:13,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2026
02:30:13,988 --> 02:30:16,370
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not somebody you're supposed to model yourself after.

2027
02:30:16,771 --> 02:30:18,172
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an idiot bully.

2028
02:30:19,333 --> 02:30:26,541
[SPEAKER_13]: As it said in the game, designed by the greatest minds of their generation to create the dumbest moron who ever lived.

2029
02:30:27,085 --> 02:30:27,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2030
02:30:27,765 --> 02:30:28,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that perspective.

2031
02:30:28,786 --> 02:30:29,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2032
02:30:29,686 --> 02:30:33,967
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2033
02:30:34,007 --> 02:30:36,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe I'll try to hang up on you and not succeed.

2034
02:30:38,348 --> 02:30:41,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask if there's any last minute stories, but Loki left the room real quick.

2035
02:30:41,389 --> 02:30:43,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's chatting with Dan about something real quick.

2036
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:45,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he chatting up my men?

2037
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:45,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

2038
02:30:45,811 --> 02:30:48,051
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing gaming something in the living room.

2039
02:30:48,731 --> 02:30:50,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't do anything kinky in there!

2040
02:30:51,492 --> 02:30:52,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Without taking pictures.

2041
02:30:52,893 --> 02:30:53,833
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only porn if you tape it.

2042
02:30:54,656 --> 02:30:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki's coming back.

2043
02:30:56,157 --> 02:30:56,978
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing, Loki?

2044
02:30:57,639 --> 02:30:58,780
[SPEAKER_13]: He's chatting up my husband.

2045
02:30:58,900 --> 02:30:59,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

2046
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:00,501
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2047
02:31:00,801 --> 02:31:01,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Last minute stories?

2048
02:31:01,782 --> 02:31:02,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2049
02:31:02,463 --> 02:31:02,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2050
02:31:03,144 --> 02:31:08,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, real quick, there's some leaked video that kind of shows off some of the new features for FIFA 12.

2051
02:31:09,789 --> 02:31:10,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks kind of neat.

2052
02:31:10,610 --> 02:31:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of making it more realistic.

2053
02:31:12,332 --> 02:31:19,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they have... Apparently, you can do some... They have unexpected behaviors that will happen.

2054
02:31:19,518 --> 02:31:20,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example...

2055
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:26,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a defender coming in, offensive player making a move that flips the player.

2056
02:31:28,221 --> 02:31:34,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, apparently you can get injuries and realistic injuries.

2057
02:31:34,523 --> 02:31:43,684
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have better dribbling and basically kind of a whole new engine that they're putting in place here.

2058
02:31:44,024 --> 02:31:45,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get to the phone because we've got another call coming in.

2059
02:31:45,745 --> 02:31:46,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Laundry.

2060
02:31:46,585 --> 02:31:46,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2061
02:31:48,294 --> 02:31:49,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo guys, it's Unicorn.

2062
02:31:49,334 --> 02:31:49,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Long time no see.

2063
02:31:50,015 --> 02:31:50,375
[SPEAKER_08]: How y'all doing?

2064
02:31:50,395 --> 02:31:51,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it has been a while.

2065
02:31:51,435 --> 02:31:52,136
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, buddy?

2066
02:31:52,756 --> 02:31:54,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Just trying to make that paper, you know.

2067
02:31:56,077 --> 02:31:56,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it rain.

2068
02:31:56,638 --> 02:31:57,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what's up?

2069
02:31:57,938 --> 02:31:58,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much, man.

2070
02:31:58,619 --> 02:31:59,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

2071
02:31:59,119 --> 02:32:02,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Just blowing some time trying to get through L.A.

2072
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:05,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Noire without cursing my head off and waking up the entire neighborhood.

2073
02:32:05,181 --> 02:32:06,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us a little bit about L.A.

2074
02:32:06,402 --> 02:32:06,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Noire.

2075
02:32:06,922 --> 02:32:08,263
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually have a question real quick.

2076
02:32:08,463 --> 02:32:09,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Is time enjoying being blown?

2077
02:32:10,524 --> 02:32:10,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

2078
02:32:11,044 --> 02:32:11,284
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2079
02:32:11,304 --> 02:32:12,184
[SPEAKER_04]: L.A.

2080
02:32:12,225 --> 02:32:12,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

2081
02:32:12,405 --> 02:32:13,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a dirty girl.

2082
02:32:13,725 --> 02:32:14,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

2083
02:32:14,665 --> 02:32:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

2084
02:32:15,106 --> 02:32:16,206
[SPEAKER_04]: She's off the hook tonight.

2085
02:32:16,266 --> 02:32:16,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2086
02:32:17,407 --> 02:32:19,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about L.A.

2087
02:32:19,267 --> 02:32:26,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire a little bit because it's not a game I've played yet because I didn't think it would be something I was interested in because I'm not super into the whole Grand Theft Auto thing.

2088
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:28,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool and all, but I'm just not very good at it.

2089
02:32:28,371 --> 02:32:36,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But in listening to Bobby's show before us tonight, he doesn't really play these types of games either, but his callers are like, no, dude, this is like a throwback to an adventure game.

2090
02:32:36,754 --> 02:32:37,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of L.A.

2091
02:32:37,775 --> 02:32:38,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire?

2092
02:32:38,797 --> 02:32:41,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so you guys actually haven't covered it on your show yet.

2093
02:32:42,602 --> 02:32:45,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I was chasing behind all my shows I'm trying to get in touch with.

2094
02:32:45,786 --> 02:32:46,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I ask you a question?

2095
02:32:47,367 --> 02:32:51,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you find the period specificness of the game a little bit bothersome?

2096
02:32:52,253 --> 02:32:53,455
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually I enjoy it.

2097
02:32:54,454 --> 02:32:54,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2098
02:32:55,934 --> 02:33:02,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I didn't know what Dan was playing at the time, and then I was hearing the guy make in the comments about Jews, and I was like, what the hell are you playing?

2099
02:33:03,017 --> 02:33:03,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that first game.

2100
02:33:03,997 --> 02:33:05,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even think of that.

2101
02:33:05,637 --> 02:33:06,798
[SPEAKER_04]: He's quite livid, he is.

2102
02:33:06,918 --> 02:33:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you should call the local news media and tell them how offended you were.

2103
02:33:09,619 --> 02:33:09,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2104
02:33:10,159 --> 02:33:13,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't give a shit, because it's a period-specific game.

2105
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:16,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't know what he was playing at the time, so I was like, what the hell are you listening to?

2106
02:33:17,455 --> 02:33:20,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that guy is a racist, so of course he's going to curse it up a bit.

2107
02:33:21,058 --> 02:33:23,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, so let me get back to the game a little bit.

2108
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:25,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't say we haven't covered L.A.

2109
02:33:25,661 --> 02:33:26,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire on the show.

2110
02:33:26,161 --> 02:33:26,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've talked about it.

2111
02:33:26,902 --> 02:33:28,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just none of us have yet to play it.

2112
02:33:28,723 --> 02:33:31,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't tell you how it is as a game.

2113
02:33:31,605 --> 02:33:33,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm relying on you, my friend.

2114
02:33:33,106 --> 02:33:33,586
[SPEAKER_04]: How is L.A.

2115
02:33:33,907 --> 02:33:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire as a game?

2116
02:33:34,987 --> 02:33:35,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about it.

2117
02:33:36,158 --> 02:33:42,545
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let me set it up so I can describe it and be as rhetorical as possible, but you get all the information in there.

2118
02:33:43,907 --> 02:33:52,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It plays like Grand Theft Auto, but it doesn't play like Grand Theft Auto in the fact that you are a police officer and you're not supposed to run amok, which is the whole game.

2119
02:33:53,057 --> 02:33:55,099
[SPEAKER_08]: The focus is on police investigation.

2120
02:33:56,511 --> 02:33:59,136
[SPEAKER_08]: and the process of police investigation.

2121
02:33:59,837 --> 02:34:07,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And the highlighting of the facial animations and using that to be able to tell if people are lying or not is the main focus of the game.

2122
02:34:08,604 --> 02:34:11,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's CSI 1940s, basically.

2123
02:34:12,105 --> 02:34:14,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like Law and Order in 1940s.

2124
02:34:15,146 --> 02:34:16,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's exactly what that is.

2125
02:34:16,666 --> 02:34:17,726
[SPEAKER_04]: All it needs is dong dong.

2126
02:34:19,767 --> 02:34:27,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this game, if you're not going to cheat your way through it and use the online stuff, it truly is a mental game.

2127
02:34:27,489 --> 02:34:28,749
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to think your way through it.

2128
02:34:29,069 --> 02:34:35,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can still get through the game and still fail left and right, but you will get a completely different experience because you didn't really...

2129
02:34:36,871 --> 02:34:59,644
[SPEAKER_08]: if you investigate a person and you're able to draw information out of them you have more things to use and search for later on in the case until you come to the end of it so am I hearing you right that you can't really lose this game it's just that there will be hallways you never go down if you don't do it well correct interesting yeah so the replay is in trying to do the cases better

2130
02:35:01,098 --> 02:35:01,618
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

2131
02:35:28,936 --> 02:35:29,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a ball.

2132
02:35:29,637 --> 02:35:31,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I even slip into jargon every once in a while.

2133
02:35:33,498 --> 02:35:35,779
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the way we are in the house here, role players.

2134
02:35:35,799 --> 02:35:38,160
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got to flex their role play muscles.

2135
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:40,241
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the life of a pig, man.

2136
02:35:40,281 --> 02:35:41,241
[SPEAKER_08]: You've just got to deal with it.

2137
02:35:42,782 --> 02:35:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: This game was on my radar, certainly, because everybody's been talking about it.

2138
02:35:46,803 --> 02:35:48,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was like, oh, it's a rock star game.

2139
02:35:49,344 --> 02:35:50,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't usually feel those so much.

2140
02:35:51,045 --> 02:35:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2141
02:35:51,785 --> 02:35:54,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're great games, but I'll never probably get into it.

2142
02:35:54,486 --> 02:35:54,947
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2143
02:36:18,385 --> 02:36:22,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So like all the billboards are where they're supposed to be and all this other stuff.

2144
02:36:22,868 --> 02:36:26,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I'll get the anagram in our chat room.

2145
02:36:26,490 --> 02:36:28,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, this sounds like Ace Attorney.

2146
02:36:28,251 --> 02:36:28,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2147
02:36:28,711 --> 02:36:31,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a Phoenix Wright type thing?

2148
02:36:31,113 --> 02:36:34,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's actually closer to that than anything else.

2149
02:36:34,394 --> 02:36:36,116
[SPEAKER_08]: You do have to drive from point to point.

2150
02:36:36,396 --> 02:36:39,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And they add the Grand Theft Auto things by responding to calls.

2151
02:36:39,538 --> 02:36:42,419
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll hear a call for officer needs support, this and that.

2152
02:36:42,739 --> 02:36:46,702
[SPEAKER_08]: You roll up on a bank robbery or somebody's trying to rob a convenience store.

2153
02:36:47,563 --> 02:36:50,450
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Officers and Chase, you gotta cut them off.

2154
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:54,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's all in there, as well as your standard stuff of driving your car.

2155
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:55,221
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

2156
02:36:56,172 --> 02:36:57,833
[SPEAKER_08]: The focus is on the investigation itself.

2157
02:36:57,873 --> 02:37:06,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for instance, for example, one of the cases involves a woman and her niece getting put in a car while they're drugged and the car goes over a cliff.

2158
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:08,240
[SPEAKER_08]: But they survive it.

2159
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So you do your interviews to figure out what's going on.

2160
02:37:11,482 --> 02:37:16,966
[SPEAKER_08]: You later on tail her and figure out she's got ties to the mob and she's going after the guy that drugged them and put them in the car.

2161
02:37:17,686 --> 02:37:31,225
[SPEAKER_08]: if you don't get to the spot if you get there in time you can catch them in the act of trying to toss the place and arrest them if you don't if you take too long to get there you have to deal with the aftermath and you have to use your CSI skills to figure out what they were looking for

2162
02:37:32,756 --> 02:37:59,726
[SPEAKER_08]: so yeah it's the way they put the gameplay in there plus later on the order that you investigate the locations determines who's available when so if you go to like for instance there's this grocery you have to investigate but for some reason they're closed until like 2-3 o'clock in the afternoon so if you go there too early you'll miss your chance to do something else like catch this one guy while he's in the bar you have to go hunt him down later yeah so the entire case is interwoven like that like a big twist-a-plot but

2163
02:38:00,134 --> 02:38:04,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you another question real quick before we let you go because I want to make sure we can free up for more calls.

2164
02:38:04,096 --> 02:38:10,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've heard a lot about how this game really seems to be pushing that line between game and movie.

2165
02:38:10,559 --> 02:38:13,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've heard about some cases where it's actually being considered art.

2166
02:38:13,841 --> 02:38:18,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody, I don't know, some gallery or something was actually kind of putting this game on display or what have you.

2167
02:38:19,024 --> 02:38:20,264
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about this game?

2168
02:38:20,304 --> 02:38:29,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this game really pushing the envelope between what is a movie, television, visual art, and a video game, which not everyone considers art if you're Roger Ebert?

2169
02:38:29,676 --> 02:38:31,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me say it like this.

2170
02:38:32,037 --> 02:38:35,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching, you guys familiar with Red Letter Media?

2171
02:38:36,899 --> 02:38:37,200
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2172
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:44,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Red Letter Media is the guys that went behind Mr. Plinkett and ripping apart the Star Wars trilogy.

2173
02:38:44,203 --> 02:38:46,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Their movies, their reviews are extremely in-depth.

2174
02:38:46,964 --> 02:38:53,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And they started up a show, and they mentioned the fact that movies have become the lowest form of entertainment.

2175
02:38:54,156 --> 02:38:58,600
[SPEAKER_08]: as far as outlook and what you expect from them.

2176
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:01,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people aren't willing to throw $10 at a bad movie.

2177
02:39:02,403 --> 02:39:08,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way movies have been going now, maybe they're not making as much money as they could be if they're spending more time writing scripts and stuff.

2178
02:39:08,668 --> 02:39:10,010
[SPEAKER_08]: They are doing that in gaming.

2179
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:13,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So that has stepped up as far as the public eye is looking for entertainment.

2180
02:39:13,633 --> 02:39:16,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just going to add fuel to that fire.

2181
02:39:16,715 --> 02:39:17,656
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that the...

2182
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:30,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Facial expressions add so much to the way you're trying to... I mean, literally, I was second guessing almost every decision I was making on whether these people were lying or not based off what I knew about the case.

2183
02:39:31,273 --> 02:39:32,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was driving me nuts.

2184
02:39:33,743 --> 02:39:34,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2185
02:39:34,503 --> 02:39:42,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way they added, there's a small audio cue that lets you know whether or not you picked if they're telling the truth, if you doubt their answer, or if they're flat out lying.

2186
02:39:43,166 --> 02:39:48,668
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a little three-note piano thing that lets you know when you pick correctly, incorrectly, the instant you push the button.

2187
02:39:48,728 --> 02:39:52,369
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just adds to that suspense when you're waiting to hear that tone.

2188
02:39:53,169 --> 02:39:56,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you miss it up, you just want to go rage comic all over the thing, but it's great.

2189
02:39:57,171 --> 02:39:58,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I love every minute of it.

2190
02:39:58,342 --> 02:40:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well you guys have sold me that I need to check it out.

2191
02:40:00,563 --> 02:40:03,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'll drop $60 for it, but I'm certainly going to rent it and check it out.

2192
02:40:03,744 --> 02:40:05,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely worth the rental.

2193
02:40:05,425 --> 02:40:06,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, absolutely.

2194
02:40:06,525 --> 02:40:09,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Xenocore, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but take care and thanks for calling.

2195
02:40:10,247 --> 02:40:11,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Ain't no problem, guys.

2196
02:40:11,067 --> 02:40:11,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it easy.

2197
02:40:11,707 --> 02:40:16,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love hearing from you because we've been talking about great voices tonight, such as the one and only George Takei.

2198
02:40:16,609 --> 02:40:17,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have a great voice.

2199
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:18,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my.

2200
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:20,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was awesome.

2201
02:40:20,941 --> 02:40:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very well done.

2202
02:40:23,282 --> 02:40:26,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear how excited Jamie got?

2203
02:40:27,243 --> 02:40:28,104
[SPEAKER_04]: The ladies love it.

2204
02:40:28,124 --> 02:40:28,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it up.

2205
02:40:28,764 --> 02:40:29,024
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2206
02:40:29,564 --> 02:40:30,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

2207
02:40:31,765 --> 02:40:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2208
02:40:32,005 --> 02:40:33,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for the Skype calls tonight.

2209
02:40:33,385 --> 02:40:35,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a couple long calls there, so we're going to go ahead and close up.

2210
02:40:35,526 --> 02:40:36,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you guys so much for calling.

2211
02:40:37,487 --> 02:40:40,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those who didn't get through, but please send us emails.

2212
02:40:40,588 --> 02:40:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2213
02:40:41,308 --> 02:40:42,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We always appreciate emails.

2214
02:40:42,669 --> 02:40:45,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's wrap up the last minute stories and then get on out of here for the night.

2215
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:45,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2216
02:40:47,409 --> 02:40:50,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so last story here.

2217
02:40:51,752 --> 02:40:52,512
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of funny.

2218
02:40:52,853 --> 02:41:04,719
[SPEAKER_03]: They have... Kenji Unifune is actually in the new Japanese RPG Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2.

2219
02:41:04,799 --> 02:41:12,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the sequel to the Hyperdimension Neptunia game that came out, I believe, last year and over here in March.

2220
02:41:13,885 --> 02:41:15,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, he plays...

2221
02:41:16,406 --> 02:41:17,146
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2222
02:41:34,554 --> 02:41:35,194
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's weird.

2223
02:41:36,414 --> 02:41:36,734
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2224
02:41:36,855 --> 02:41:39,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2225
02:41:40,275 --> 02:41:44,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to now go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we wrap up for the show tonight.

2226
02:41:44,896 --> 02:41:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

2227
02:41:45,856 --> 02:41:46,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I want Pinkberry.

2228
02:41:47,977 --> 02:41:48,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinkberry's closed.

2229
02:41:50,357 --> 02:41:50,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

2230
02:41:51,438 --> 02:41:53,118
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time we're done with the post show.

2231
02:41:53,178 --> 02:41:54,518
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2232
02:41:55,058 --> 02:41:55,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in two weeks.

2233
02:41:55,859 --> 02:41:57,499
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do with the week off?

2234
02:42:01,376 --> 02:42:12,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be sad that the season of Supernatural is over for two whole weeks and then go back to the episode where Sam had no shirt and no soul.

2235
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:15,281
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all about just what...

2236
02:42:16,121 --> 02:42:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Get you going tonight.

2237
02:42:44,269 --> 02:42:49,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't hate, my friend had to wait in line for four hours Not hating, I'm not hating, but you have to bring me back a Duffy

2238
02:42:49,884 --> 02:42:50,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not bringing you back a Duffy.

2239
02:42:51,025 --> 02:42:52,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll bring you back a Star Wars preview or something.

2240
02:42:53,007 --> 02:42:53,907
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm teasing.

2241
02:42:53,927 --> 02:42:54,568
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a good girl.

2242
02:42:54,948 --> 02:42:55,569
[SPEAKER_13]: You know I'm teasing.

2243
02:42:55,689 --> 02:42:55,889
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2244
02:42:56,449 --> 02:42:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki, your final thought tonight?

2245
02:42:59,212 --> 02:43:03,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I'll play some more games this week other than Grand Theft Auto.

2246
02:43:03,255 --> 02:43:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be nice.

2247
02:43:03,835 --> 02:43:06,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are you going to do with the week off?

2248
02:43:07,038 --> 02:43:12,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an invite to go to the new members party for Mensa, but I don't know if I'm going to.

2249
02:43:12,523 --> 02:43:13,443
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to go to that.

2250
02:43:14,844 --> 02:43:18,845
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I can only imagine the type of people that are there.

2251
02:43:19,865 --> 02:43:21,525
[SPEAKER_03]: We want pictures of hot Mensa chicks.

2252
02:43:24,086 --> 02:43:24,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

2253
02:43:24,586 --> 02:43:26,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm just picturing old... Look at that Mensa booty!

2254
02:43:27,306 --> 02:43:31,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pictured old people playing cards and boring card games.

2255
02:43:31,407 --> 02:43:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to play Bunko?

2256
02:43:33,127 --> 02:43:36,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Bunko, they're like playing... Canasta.

2257
02:43:36,108 --> 02:43:37,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Cribbage and hearts.

2258
02:43:37,888 --> 02:43:38,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan plays Cribbage.

2259
02:43:38,628 --> 02:43:40,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I can play Cribbage, I can be a Mensa.

2260
02:43:40,489 --> 02:43:41,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play Cribbage with Mensa people.

2261
02:43:42,649 --> 02:43:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2262
02:43:47,355 --> 02:43:48,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I joined up just to get the plaque.

2263
02:43:48,918 --> 02:43:50,300
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what it was all about.

2264
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:55,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I have the plaque hanging at my desk at work, the rest is all optional.

2265
02:43:55,768 --> 02:43:57,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

2266
02:43:57,729 --> 02:43:59,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys that there won't be a show next week.

2267
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:00,691
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope this is enough to hold you over.

2268
02:44:00,991 --> 02:44:01,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Look forward to this.

2269
02:44:01,712 --> 02:44:06,635
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very, very likely going to be multiple shows during E3 week, so look forward to that.

2270
02:44:06,735 --> 02:44:09,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have more details on that when we come back in two weeks.

2271
02:44:09,577 --> 02:44:11,518
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

2272
02:44:11,558 --> 02:44:12,459
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a free show.

2273
02:44:12,499 --> 02:44:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't charge you.

2274
02:44:13,320 --> 02:44:16,802
[SPEAKER_04]: We really don't do commercials outside of the ones for our side shows, which I think is okay.

2275
02:44:17,202 --> 02:44:17,863
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2276
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:37,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So please help us spread the word.

2277
02:44:37,722 --> 02:44:38,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend.

2278
02:44:38,522 --> 02:44:43,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave a nice review on iTunes, Five Stars, or whatever podcast website, podcast alley, anywhere.

2279
02:44:43,666 --> 02:44:44,606
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it.

2280
02:44:45,227 --> 02:44:49,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Until next time, we'll be back in two weeks with another edition of Orange Lingerie.

2281
02:44:50,130 --> 02:44:53,252
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you in America, have a wonderful Memorial Day holiday.

2282
02:44:53,592 --> 02:44:54,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Be safe.

2283
02:44:54,973 --> 02:44:58,416
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you going to Fatima or whatever conventions are going on that weekend, don't get too drunk.

2284
02:44:58,976 --> 02:45:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you not in America, have a great Sunday night next week without us.

2285
02:45:03,479 --> 02:45:04,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in two weeks.

2286
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:04,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, guys.

2287
02:45:05,060 --> 02:45:05,452
