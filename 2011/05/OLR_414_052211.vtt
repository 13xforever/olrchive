00:00.000 --> 00:20.520
Tonight, May 22nd, 2011, some PSP games are rumored to be remade for the PlayStation 3

00:20.520 --> 00:23.000
and anticipated 3DS title is delayed.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.400
And will Nintendo's new home console be equipped with a camera?

00:31.400 --> 00:34.400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:34.400 --> 00:35.400
Lounge Radio.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.560
It's the show where every gamer has a voice and this is episode number 414 for May the

00:40.560 --> 00:42.520
22nd of 2011.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.520
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.280
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.800
First off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
Yo.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
How are you doing?

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
Yo.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Yo.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
No.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.640
I heard you got drunk last night.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.340
I didn't get as drunk as I did at the last party.

00:58.340 --> 01:03.040
You got drunk and played rock band and sang Lady Gaga and yet there's no video of this.

01:03.040 --> 01:11.500
I've got video though of the guys at the party doing a Snoop Dogg song.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.160
It's really a dark video but I have it.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
It's on my phone.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.160
Alright.

01:15.160 --> 01:20.800
But I also tried to sing Bon Jovi and it's sad when men have a higher range than I do.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.600
Hi spouse.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.960
Is Dan coming to say hi on the show?

01:23.960 --> 01:24.960
No.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
I guess not.

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
Alright.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.000
Well, I have to introduce the other host that's here that's not Dan.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.240
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
Yes.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
I'm definitely not Dan.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
How are you, Loki?

01:34.240 --> 01:35.640
I'm fine.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.800
That's good, Loki.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
What's new with you?

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Not much.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.880
Just sitting at home.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.880
You're boring.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.920
Well, you know, I started some projects.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.160
Well, more projects on projects.

01:49.160 --> 01:55.280
No, I started my three foot tall papercraft statue of the portal turret.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
That's right.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.280
Ooh.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.200
I keep forgetting you're building your own portal turret.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.880
That kind of cracks me up.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.440
I don't know why.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
I want one.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.640
Well, as soon as I get the design correct, because right now unfortunately the 3D model

02:09.640 --> 02:16.360
I ported over using Pepakura had a lot of internal stuff because it was actually a full

02:16.360 --> 02:18.840
3D model with the actual guns and stuff.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.480
This turret's not going to have the doors open with the guns showing.

02:22.480 --> 02:28.900
But it still tried to create papercraft pieces for all that stuff that you're never going

02:28.900 --> 02:29.900
to see.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.540
So I had to filter out the stuff that I didn't need.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.920
You know, I've actually done a turret model that doesn't have the doors or anything, right?

02:35.920 --> 02:41.320
Yeah, but I've already printed it all out and I don't know.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.160
If I run into problems, then yeah.

02:43.160 --> 02:48.360
Let me introduce the always present fourth guest on our show at the chat room at chat.orangelountraining.com

02:48.360 --> 02:52.280
because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at

02:52.280 --> 02:56.520
All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.160
So we invite you to join us for a live show sometime or all the time.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.160
Like a lot of our chatties, we see a lot of familiar faces.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.560
One of those familiar faces starts us off tonight with this chat comment.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.560
Tigerclaw says, what's up Sky Dark Soccer Loki?

03:08.560 --> 03:10.400
I got to ask you guys this.

03:10.400 --> 03:16.680
What did the three of you do on the day of the rapture, Sind?

03:16.680 --> 03:25.600
I played some World of Warcraft and slept in and then I went to a very gay Jewish party.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.760
First off, can I say fuck that rapture guy?

03:27.760 --> 03:32.480
Like fuck him in the ear and fuck CNN and fuck MSNBC and all these websites that give

03:32.480 --> 03:35.680
him attention and like make people want to tweet about it and all that stuff.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.680
And look, I'm no better.

03:36.680 --> 03:41.040
I made my fair share of rapture jokes, but I'm not talking about like snarky Facebook

03:41.040 --> 03:43.040
posts because that's what websites like that are for.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.320
But like, you know, there's real news going on in the world that's just, yes, I realize

03:47.320 --> 03:50.920
this is a video game podcast, but I'm on my soapbox and made a funny picture.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.760
It just, it just downs me that some asshole can come out and say, no, really guys, it's

03:54.760 --> 03:56.080
going to end May 21st.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
So sell your shit.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.420
I'm totally surreal for real, for real, real here.

04:01.420 --> 04:06.160
So I'm going to just say the world's going to end on Christmas.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.760
It's going to be really fucking ironic.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.400
We're going to all die on Christmas.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.160
So there you go.

04:11.160 --> 04:15.840
And now listen to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to hear more of the Gospel.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.440
Isn't it like allegedly supposed to end in like December 2012 because of the Mayan calendar

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
seems garbage?

04:21.440 --> 04:22.440
It's always supposed to fucking end.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
The same guy says it's going to end in the 90s.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.920
Okay, on top of that too, okay, and this is me getting into a little bit of technical

04:27.920 --> 04:28.920
history.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.000
If I am right, the Mayans used a lunar calendar, meaning that their months are on a different

04:32.000 --> 04:35.920
basis than it would be on the Gregorian calendar, because right now it's like halfway through

04:35.920 --> 04:36.920
the Jewish year.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.140
Yeah, but I'm sure no one would jump to conclusions and saying that the world's going to end

04:41.140 --> 04:42.140
on a specific date.

04:42.140 --> 04:45.600
They obviously have some scientific fact to back that up.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.280
I mean, what are we, savages?

04:48.280 --> 04:54.280
I mean, no one just goes out spouting random garbage like the world's going to end yesterday

04:54.280 --> 04:58.200
and it doesn't happen without any sort of proof.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.280
This is just the irony to me is that they can't find the dude, Camping was named Harold

05:02.280 --> 05:10.480
Camping, and that the family radio, the site that he's like the president of, is down.

05:10.480 --> 05:15.120
So I posted in the chatroom the picture that I made about the URL being raptured.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.520
Well, he was a false prophet and he's going to burn in hell for all eternity.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
Yay!

05:19.520 --> 05:21.000
Can we talk about video games now?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Hell's his concept.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
He can go there.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
All right.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Let's go to how was your gaming week?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.960
Uh, DarkSakura, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.800
I caught World of Warcraft, addict.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
Dealer.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.760
You're my crack dealer now, which, by the way, I need you to look at my setup later.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.760
I will.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.240
Yeah, I played some World of Warcraft.

05:40.240 --> 05:46.480
I put Rebecca Black on hold and I am now playing Blodwin, who is a shammy, who I'm kicking

05:46.480 --> 05:47.480
butt with.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.480
I was on Hoard House, which was fun.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
You were.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.480
Yeah.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.480
We had a good time.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.480
Except when, when you and Extrofer were going off about something, so I got up and got some

05:55.480 --> 05:56.480
water.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.480
I didn't even know you left.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
Because I'm that good.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.680
Was the show getting too nerdy for you?

06:00.680 --> 06:01.680
No, no.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.520
I was actually super thirsty the entire time.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.920
Hoardhouse.com, plug, plug, plug.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.720
One of these days I'm going to actually read a comic book and then be all like, I should

06:08.720 --> 06:09.720
be on Comic Insanity.

06:09.720 --> 06:17.120
I did that on Comic Insanity this morning, too, because Shadow was talking about Final

06:17.120 --> 06:20.120
Fantasy IX and he and Tiara were like, oh, Final Fantasy IX, blah, blah, blah.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
I'm like, I didn't play it.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.280
I got up and got some coffee.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.280
Nice.

06:24.280 --> 06:28.520
Yeah, now everybody knows how professional I am.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.680
But I also played, I started back on going back through some of the chapters on Portal

06:32.680 --> 06:34.720
2 to try to get achievements.

06:34.720 --> 06:41.520
So I already got the door prize, which is super easy.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.240
But there's also, you can get the two achievements at one time.

06:45.240 --> 06:50.060
The door prize, when you first find like the first area that's got these doors, three doors

06:50.060 --> 06:53.380
up in the top, you go up there and you listen to each door and he talks about your blood

06:53.380 --> 06:58.120
turning into gasoline and having to pee and something else.

06:58.120 --> 07:03.000
And then when, right before you get GLaDOS again, I don't care if I'm spoiling, when

07:03.000 --> 07:08.320
you're in the top office, you go in behind a file cabinet is a door that leads you to

07:08.320 --> 07:11.480
three more vitrified doors and then where the Borealis dock is.

07:11.480 --> 07:16.440
So you'll get the door prize thing for listening to Cave Johnson rant like a madman and then

07:16.440 --> 07:18.900
finding the remnants of the Borealis.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.280
So I did that.

07:21.280 --> 07:26.680
The next one I'm doing a Smash TV where you have to break all the like 11 monitors that

07:26.680 --> 07:28.240
Wheatley's jabbering at you at.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.880
Yeah, some of those are pretty hard.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.000
The key to doing the Wheatley ones is lasers.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.300
Yeah, I know that, but I'm just saying some of the ones that had no lasers.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.100
And I've got to go back and get the Turret Symphony.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.400
The Turrets practicing singing.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.000
Oh yes, I have that one.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.260
And I also need to get secret transmission, which actually there's two secret transmissions

07:48.260 --> 07:51.560
in Portal 2 I found out.

07:51.560 --> 07:58.360
When you're on the, and everybody listen up, when you're doing the aerial faith plate test,

07:58.360 --> 08:03.840
it's a big one with all the room full of faith plates, and GLaDOS shoots garbage at you.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.840
You take...

08:04.840 --> 08:07.680
Okay, I'm trying to explain exactly where the things are.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.080
You take the radio, you can actually get two achievements here.

08:11.080 --> 08:15.920
One of them is putting your portal on top of the place over the giant button, and then

08:15.920 --> 08:16.920
the...

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920
Three achievements actually.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.540
Oh, let me do the two I know.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.000
And then you put your portal on the ramp so that when the thing goes in the ramp it falls

08:23.000 --> 08:27.200
down and falls right on the button and you get the achievement for not touching a thing

08:27.200 --> 08:32.480
and having it land on the button, but you also go back and when you launch into the

08:32.480 --> 08:36.240
one that's on the ramp but your other portal is going to be on this thing across from the

08:36.240 --> 08:39.920
part jutting out, and it busts you through a window and you find another rat man den

08:39.920 --> 08:46.160
and if you've got the radio with you it will play a modem sound, and what that is it actually

08:46.160 --> 08:48.840
translates into an image if you've got a decoder.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
Wow.

08:49.840 --> 08:55.040
Because, you know, they had the whole ARG thing going on, the alternate reality game,

08:55.040 --> 09:02.160
it was basically connecting to a BBS with an old 33k modem or something, and all these

09:02.160 --> 09:04.640
images and stuff would go through.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.880
I miss BBSs.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.640
I want a BBS for Orange Lounge Radio where I can play Trade Wars 2002 all over again.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.000
The other one is when you're in the lower labs and you're playing in commentary mode

09:15.000 --> 09:21.200
you'll find a developer commentary that's nothing but modem noise, and it's a picture

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
too.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
Hey nerds.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.600
Actually it's not a picture.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.560
It's them talking about part of the development of Portal 2.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.560
Wait, this is important.

09:29.560 --> 09:34.160
Nerds in chat, I need to know, can you still download like Telguard and stuff and set it

09:34.160 --> 09:36.600
up to run off of like Telnet or whatever?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.600
Probably.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
Is that possible?

09:38.600 --> 09:39.600
Because we need to make that happen.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
Probably.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.400
Oh come on, there's so many retro gamers out there that I bet there's still a gemstone

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
server running somewhere.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.840
Ooh, I haven't played that in forever.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.960
The third achievement is by picking up the broken turret that gets launched in there

09:51.960 --> 09:52.960
and you launch it.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.960
Oh yeah, turret dactyl.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.600
Yeah, if you launch a turret with an aerial faith plate you get an achievement for it.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.600
Oh, that I've done.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.600
I know I did that.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
I think that was a different statement.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
I didn't do that one either.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.600
I need to do more co-op.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
I haven't played enough.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.240
I'll play co-op with you, but I'll probably end up throwing up all over Sharmi.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.720
I don't know, he's a cat.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.000
I watch the human vault section, so.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.040
Blackwolf in the chat room says yes, and there are lots of Telnet BBSs out there.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.440
OMG, I want an OLR1.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.440
Like really bad.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.440
Let's do it.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.440
Like come on you guys.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.440
Somebody in the chat room, do it.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.440
No, I'll do it.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.440
Rob will do it, okay.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.440
I'll do it, because I want to be the sis-op.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.440
Okay.

10:26.440 --> 10:32.400
I always wanted my own BBS when I was a kid, but my mom wouldn't let me get a second phone

10:32.400 --> 10:33.400
line.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
So let's set up the OLR BBS.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400
Yeah, I want an OLR BBS.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
Okay.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.400
Let me make that happen.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
Alright, anyhow.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.400
Anything else?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.440
We have like two different conversations going on here.

10:42.440 --> 10:46.640
One of them very modern with Portal 2, and the other one not so modern with BBSs and

10:46.640 --> 10:52.080
Telnet and The Pit and Trade Wars, Legend of the Red Dragon.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.600
I actually did try to play some of the DAC, but my computer farted on me while I was trying

10:56.600 --> 10:59.320
to play the Star Trek.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.480
And I tried playing Darwinia.

11:01.480 --> 11:06.320
That game's confusing, and it gives me a bit of a headache.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.280
So I'm going to have to probably take a whole bunch of mydol and try playing it again.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.680
Because no, it really does give me a headache.

11:13.680 --> 11:18.380
The modeling in it, and the colors, makes my head hurt.

11:18.380 --> 11:21.280
So sadness.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.280
Getting old sucks.

11:22.280 --> 11:26.920
No, it's definitely, that's always done it to me.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.200
And then I played By Shermy Cat Food the game.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
The end.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.880
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:33.880 --> 11:37.080
I wish I could say that I played exciting stuff, but I haven't.

11:37.080 --> 11:41.280
I just played Grand Theft Auto, and a brief bit of Portal, because I was trying to test

11:41.280 --> 11:45.520
something on my graphics card, because for some reason in Grand Theft Auto on my PC,

11:45.520 --> 11:47.520
it decided, hey, you know what, I'm going to run really slow now.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.020
And I was like, what?

11:49.020 --> 11:53.960
Why are you running slow when you're running perfectly fine, just all the other days?

11:53.960 --> 11:59.960
And it ended up that I was trying to overclock my laptop's graphics card, and I think the

11:59.960 --> 12:03.560
program ran in the background.

12:03.560 --> 12:07.400
Slowed things down, actually, because I did a cooling mod on this thing, so I actually

12:07.400 --> 12:12.000
have the fans kicked up, and there's a big old intake vent in the back now.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.280
And I normally have a cooling pad that go on the bottom of this, but I don't have it

12:16.280 --> 12:17.280
with me right now.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.860
But it's running much cooler.

12:18.860 --> 12:24.000
And so now I can actually overclock the GPU when I get a chance.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.440
I haven't really bothered to make it stable yet.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.440
So yeah.

12:29.440 --> 12:34.440
But I will be playing later on tonight, once I get done moving some stuff around.

12:34.440 --> 12:39.680
I have a leaked copy of the Duke Nukem Forever demo that I will be checking out, because

12:39.680 --> 12:45.040
Duke Nukem Forever is awesome, and the fact that I can play a part of it, it's like it's

12:45.040 --> 12:46.040
not even...

12:46.040 --> 12:47.480
I didn't realize it already had, like, leaked.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.680
Oh yeah, they have an internal demo that's really, really buggy.

12:50.680 --> 12:51.680
Hmm.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.080
Because the real one's out, what, June 3rd or something like that?

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
Yes.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
Awesome.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.760
Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which

12:59.760 --> 13:05.320
is also, a lot of the same old stuff, you know, it's kind of a slow period for me right

13:05.320 --> 13:07.020
now with games.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.400
More Warcraft, of course, as always.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.000
Another game I don't want to talk about tonight, but I'm going to talk about it on Hoard House

13:12.000 --> 13:15.240
this week, and it'll make sense when we get to Thursday.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.520
And then I want to mention a couple other games I've been playing.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.800
The new one, well not new, this game's like two years old and I'm just now getting around

13:22.800 --> 13:30.240
to it, is the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame Collection I played this week on Xbox 360.

13:30.240 --> 13:35.880
I actually had this game on the Wii a few years ago, and there was like a year difference

13:35.880 --> 13:37.040
between the releases.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.120
One of them came out in 08, I think, and the other one came out in 09.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.680
And I played the newer one, the 360 one, which was also released on PS3.

13:44.680 --> 13:49.360
And it's old pinball games, and they're classic tables, redone for the 360.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.000
So if you like, you know, pinball FX and these types of games, this is right up your alley.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.080
And these are pinball tables most of us remember from, you know, 20 years ago, if, you know,

13:58.080 --> 14:00.960
you were around 20 years ago and going to arcades.

14:00.960 --> 14:05.440
So for example, Tales of Arabian Nights is in this game, I love that table.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.880
Whirlwind, the one that had the little fan at the top.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.200
We had one in my garage.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.520
The old school Black Knight.

14:10.520 --> 14:14.160
Pimbot, everybody knows Pimbot, because they had an NES game of Pimbot, so you can play

14:14.160 --> 14:15.160
the authentic table.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.680
Pimbot's actually kind of a crappy table, like it's a cheap ass table.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.000
Bride of Pimbot is great.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I like Bride of Pimbot, but that sadly is not in this compilation.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.600
Neither is Theater of Magic.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.560
Actually Jackbot is the best of the bot ones.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.040
And that's, no, not in the collection either.

14:29.040 --> 14:35.080
But there's some other interesting tables, I think about 12 tables in all.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.200
Certainly the, I sound quiet, I shouldn't sound quiet.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.800
No, everybody in chat says I sound fine.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.560
Of course, live radio, the joys of that.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.400
Anyhow, I'll turn myself up just a wee bit.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
There you go.

14:49.400 --> 14:54.240
Alright, so other things about the compilation, it's kind of weird because some of the games

14:54.240 --> 14:59.520
are free, and then some of them will cost you credits, which is odd to me, that you

14:59.520 --> 15:03.040
just don't get everything for free at the start, but I guess it wants to give you something

15:03.040 --> 15:04.040
to work towards.

15:04.040 --> 15:09.340
But as far as the important stuff, the translation itself, you know, it works.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.340
It's nice.

15:10.340 --> 15:14.920
A little bit pricey probably, you know, considering it's, I think it was what, about 40 bucks

15:14.920 --> 15:19.960
when it came out, you know, just for 12 tables and you got Pinball FX that offers, you know,

15:19.960 --> 15:22.440
some pretty competitive tables at a good price.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.440
But now that the game's kind of old, you can probably find it really cheap.

15:25.440 --> 15:29.680
And if you are a Pinball fan, you should probably pick it up because it's a good compilation

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
of games.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.200
Otherwise, continuing to play some of the games I talked about last week like Might

15:33.200 --> 15:40.720
Magic, Order of Chaos or whatever it's called, the puzzle game on 360, and some other stuff

15:40.720 --> 15:45.360
like Mortal Kombat, which I've had very mixed success playing it online.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.640
Sometimes it's very laggy.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.900
Sometimes it's pretty smooth, but every time I lose horrifically because I'm really bad

15:51.900 --> 15:54.960
at Mortal Kombat, and that makes me sad.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.440
So that does it for my gaming week.

15:57.440 --> 16:01.680
So let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.760
Join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, or of course our Facebook, facebook.com

16:05.760 --> 16:07.980
slash orange lounge radio.

16:07.980 --> 16:09.280
Something else is important to note.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.320
Next week is Memorial Day weekend, and we know there's several anime conventions going

16:13.320 --> 16:16.520
on and other things of that sort, other types of conventions.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.880
We're not going to be here with the show next week.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.840
We're actually going to take the week off because of Memorial Day, and I'm actually

16:20.840 --> 16:22.920
going to be out of town on top of that.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.580
So sadly, we will not be here next week, Memorial Day.

16:25.580 --> 16:26.840
I'm hating you right now, Rob.

16:26.840 --> 16:27.840
I'm sorry.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.840
I'm being hateful in judgment.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.680
I will make it up to you in three weeks.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.680
I know.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.440
In three weeks is going to be more awesomer.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.440
So I'm going...

16:35.440 --> 16:37.800
I need to find 50 bucks to get a Duffy.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.520
I'm going to be going to the happiest place on earth twice within a month span, but that's

16:41.520 --> 16:42.520
just the way it works.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.520
Hateful, jealous, judgmental.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.140
Well, deal with it.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.680
That's the sound of my falling sunglasses.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
Deal with it.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
All right.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.680
Rob, hearts.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.680
What?

16:51.680 --> 16:52.680
Hearts.

16:52.680 --> 16:59.780
So yeah, no show next week, but we are looking at doing some special shows the week of E3,

16:59.780 --> 17:02.080
and I'm not sure how that's going to work yet.

17:02.080 --> 17:06.120
I know that's weird because we're not actually going to E3, but we have a pal of ours who

17:06.120 --> 17:09.280
does a show before us here at All Games Radio who's going to E3.

17:09.280 --> 17:13.680
So we're hoping we can kind of get some reports from him and interject that with our own sassy

17:13.680 --> 17:18.000
commentary and the rest of your voices on the internet through Twitter and so forth.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.760
So we're looking at doing some type of E3 specials.

17:19.760 --> 17:24.220
We're not sure exactly what time yet, but that will happen the week of E3.

17:24.220 --> 17:27.800
I've already been limbering my eyes up.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.760
So I can roll them like nothing else when I see the Nintendo press conference.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
He's going to roll it like a katamari.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.360
I'm going to be like, oh god, seriously?

17:36.360 --> 17:38.880
This is your great idea?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.560
I have low expectations for Nintendo.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.400
Let's see if they can limbo under that.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.400
All right.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.480
Well, we'll see.

17:45.480 --> 17:50.760
And I'm really hoping we can get Loki to come to the show whenever Nintendo's press conference.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.400
Ideally, well, you'll have to work whenever.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
When is the Nintendo press conference?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
It's during the day.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
So you'll have to be at work.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.880
I really don't work when those are going on because I'll, I'll stop what I'm doing and

17:59.880 --> 18:00.880
watch it.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.480
Cause I want to get your immediate reaction to those press conferences.

18:04.480 --> 18:09.240
Oh, I'll be on Twitter, but what the fuck is that?

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
Really?

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
That's a great idea.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.960
Oh, awesome.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.140
We need to do some type of like where we are commenting on the press conferences as they're

18:17.140 --> 18:19.440
going on and then you can like download it later on.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.000
It's like a riff tracks type of thing.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't know.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
We'll see.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
No, not really.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.240
Well, it's technically possible because they do syndicate that stuff later on so that you

18:29.240 --> 18:31.980
can re-watch the actual videos and stuff.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.920
So we could do that.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.320
Nah, too much effort.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.320
All right.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.320
Yeah, exactly.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.320
I would say that.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.320
All right.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.740
So we will not be here next week on Memorial Day weekend, sadly.

18:41.740 --> 18:46.280
We will be back the week after though, which happens to be the Sunday before E3.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.440
And that's when the news is really going to start to roll in.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.440
In fact, I think we're going to get to a story on this later.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.640
One of the developers is doing their press conference Sunday night.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.640
They're kind of getting a jump on everybody else.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.680
So it's going to be very interesting.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.640
So the news will start flooding in in two weeks.

19:00.640 --> 19:06.000
I might actually do a little bit of a commentary on my Tumblr as well.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
All across the internets.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah, why not?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
All right.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.440
They're looking to have 1,000,000 viewers.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.440
Let's move on.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.760
Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.280
There's still a lot going on in the gaming world, ramping up to E3 this week.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.720
So let's go to Loki, who's going to start us off tonight.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.720
Yes.

19:24.720 --> 19:29.560
Sony announced their titles that are going to be a part of the Welcome Back program.

19:29.560 --> 19:36.040
Of course, the Welcome Back program includes a free 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus for

19:36.040 --> 19:37.960
all PlayStation Network users.

19:37.960 --> 19:45.760
Also they're going to be giving out a 30-day trial to Curiosity, I guess.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.760
Or Curiosity.

19:46.760 --> 19:47.760
Whatever.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.320
I'm calling it Curiosity.

19:50.320 --> 20:00.880
And then also, apparently, two free PlayStation games and two free PlayStation Portable games.

20:00.880 --> 20:06.520
Of the free PlayStation 3 games that are available for North America, because it's a little bit

20:06.520 --> 20:13.520
different in each region, Dead Nation, Infamous, LittleBigPlanet, SuperStardust HD, and Wipeout

20:13.520 --> 20:14.960
HD Plus Fury...

20:14.960 --> 20:19.240
Well, I already own two of those, so that's going to narrow down my choices of what I'm

20:19.240 --> 20:20.240
going to get.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
Exactly.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.240
Same here.

20:22.240 --> 20:28.080
For PSP owners, I guess, you'll be able to get LittleBigPlanet on PSP, Modination Racers,

20:28.080 --> 20:31.520
Pursuit Force, or Killzone Liberation.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.640
And then, of course, they're going to have a selection of On Us movie rentals through

20:35.640 --> 20:39.840
the PlayStation Network, and I guess existing PlayStation Plus subscribers will receive

20:39.840 --> 20:46.920
an additional 60 days of free subscription, and existing Music Unlimited Premium trial

20:46.920 --> 20:52.920
subscription members will receive an additional 30 days of free music as well, and also an

20:52.920 --> 20:58.040
additional 30 days plus time lost for existing members of the Music Unlimited Premium basic

20:58.040 --> 21:02.920
subscription fee, free of charge.

21:02.920 --> 21:09.600
And Home, of course, they're going to have 100 free items in Home.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.160
Can one of those items be useful clubhouses?

21:13.160 --> 21:14.560
No.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.400
Damn.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.560
In Europe, they're going to be doing some slightly different titles.

21:20.560 --> 21:27.760
They're going to have Ratchet & Clank, Quest for Booty, Wipeout HD, Fury, Dead Nation,

21:27.760 --> 21:29.400
Infamous, and LittleBigPlanet.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.760
And then, of course, on PSP, actually the titles are the same on PSP.

21:33.760 --> 21:38.840
But I guess it's going to be slightly different for each region, which begs the question,

21:38.840 --> 21:44.680
since PlayStation Network accounts are free to create, I had three of them, so I guess

21:44.680 --> 21:49.720
I get six games, because I had three accounts.

21:49.720 --> 21:54.200
Is there going to be a thing where maybe you have to have used a credit card in a transaction

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
or something?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
I don't think so.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
Interesting.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.000
Because technically, I mean, I could download some free download content or something like

22:01.000 --> 22:05.600
that and never had to buy anything, but I'm still out of, you know, the three, four weeks

22:05.600 --> 22:07.120
or whatever it was down.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.960
What if I share a PlayStation with somebody else, like, you know, my significant other

22:10.960 --> 22:14.320
lives with me and we share an account, or I mean, I'm sorry, we don't share an account,

22:14.320 --> 22:17.560
we share a PlayStation, but we have two separate accounts, so will I get to get two and he'll

22:17.560 --> 22:18.560
get to get the other two?

22:18.560 --> 22:19.560
That's what I'm thinking.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.560
Nice!

22:20.560 --> 22:21.560
Yes, that's what I'm thinking.

22:21.560 --> 22:28.240
I mean, I could be wrong, either way, let me put it this way, I mean, I have LittleBigPlanet

22:28.240 --> 22:33.400
already and I would never, I wouldn't want to download it, because I have my, you know,

22:33.400 --> 22:39.020
really rare LittleBigPlanet with the band music in there, you know, I'd probably pick

22:39.020 --> 22:43.600
up Infamous because that looked pretty good, but the rest of the PlayStation Network games,

22:43.600 --> 22:50.480
I just don't really care too much about those, maybe, I don't know, Dead Nation looked alright

22:50.480 --> 22:56.800
or Wipeout, I really don't care, but, you know, if I can pick six titles, then I'll

22:56.800 --> 23:01.120
probably get everything and then we'll see what Japan has whenever they get around to

23:01.120 --> 23:03.160
come back up.

23:03.160 --> 23:09.800
Let's see, some other fun stuff, Sony-related, the PlayStation Network, they had opened up

23:09.800 --> 23:16.840
their website for changing your password, and apparently, the sign-ins, they've disabled

23:16.840 --> 23:25.160
them because they found a potential exploit that people could use to, you know, basically

23:25.160 --> 23:26.520
hack your account.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
Awesome.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.760
Okay, now keep reading.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.520
And this is great, it says, Sony has issued a statement on the PlayStation Blog describing

23:37.520 --> 23:44.280
the issue as a URL exploit we have subsequently fixed, it says consumers who have resetted

23:44.280 --> 23:48.560
their passwords for PlayStation Network are still encouraged to do so directly on their

23:48.560 --> 23:52.860
PS3, otherwise they can continue to do so via the website as soon as we bring that back

23:52.860 --> 23:53.860
up.

23:53.860 --> 24:02.400
But apparently, yeah, I guess it allowed people to go some roundabout way to change their

24:02.400 --> 24:08.440
password and get access to their account.

24:08.440 --> 24:14.800
It's very minor and it got, you know, fixed pretty quick, but it's just, you can't keep

24:14.800 --> 24:18.200
making these mistakes, you really gotta be on your toes, you know.

24:18.200 --> 24:24.240
Oh wait, I love this comment in our chat room from Islander, by the way, O-L-R, a lot of

24:24.240 --> 24:28.920
people on home right now, actually it's like i3linder, but I'm just saying.

24:28.920 --> 24:29.920
Blender?

24:29.920 --> 24:32.880
Oh, it's, oh, it's a little bee, okay, Blender.

24:32.880 --> 24:36.920
Blender says, by the way, O-L-R, a lot of people on home right now are having freezing

24:36.920 --> 24:38.760
issues when they get a new item.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.720
Some sort of bug since the relaunch.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.800
So home is freezing whenever you get a new item.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.080
I guess home is hell.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.520
Awesome.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.080
And then this is great, and it keeps on going from here.

24:55.080 --> 25:03.080
Now this isn't necessarily PlayStation related, but apparently Sony had another website hacked

25:03.080 --> 25:07.080
and people have started stealing virtual currency.

25:07.080 --> 25:14.400
It's, I guess, some Sony-run internet service provider called Sonet.

25:14.400 --> 25:19.880
They had some virtual points or whatever and people apparently stole roughly a hundred

25:19.880 --> 25:25.880
thousand yen or, you know, twelve hundred dollars worth of virtual points.

25:25.880 --> 25:32.280
And it says no personal information was compromised or any other accounts, but, you know, it's

25:32.280 --> 25:34.880
still kind of pathetic that you're having multiple accounts assigned.

25:34.880 --> 25:38.640
In fact, there's another story that I don't even think was on here where they had another

25:38.640 --> 25:44.800
account, another website that got hacked and became a phishing account now, phishing websites.

25:44.800 --> 25:51.120
So man, Sony is just the Internet's bitch right now.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.200
I don't know.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.200
It's kind of sad.

25:53.200 --> 25:58.080
Well, somebody is seriously kicking them while they're down, which is pretty much sad.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.800
I feel bad for them in a way.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.680
And on top of all that, you know, because, you know, the one site that was turned into

26:03.680 --> 26:09.960
kind of a phishing site was actually, I believe, a Japanese website for Sony.

26:09.960 --> 26:16.520
Well, the Japanese government refuses to let Sony relaunch the PlayStation Network there.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.520
They haven't given approval for it.

26:18.520 --> 26:27.000
And it says apparently the Ministry of Economy, Content, Industry says the government refused

26:27.000 --> 26:32.960
Sony's initiative to launch the platform again.

26:32.960 --> 26:38.600
As of May 13th, Sony was incomplete in exercising measures that they said they will do on the

26:38.600 --> 26:43.520
May 1st press conference, says the details of which the measures haven't been enacted

26:43.520 --> 26:45.560
yet were not released.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.040
The source added that the government wants clear terms of what Sony is planning on doing

26:50.040 --> 26:54.320
to protect its users credit card info, saying there were similar cases in the past that

26:54.320 --> 26:59.080
were caused by other firms and we're asking Sony whether their measures are good enough

26:59.080 --> 27:03.840
to good enough when compared to countermeasures taken in the past.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.600
I mean, that sounds fair enough.

27:05.600 --> 27:11.800
It's kind of a big deal, like, that the country's basically saying, uh, no, you're not coming

27:11.800 --> 27:14.160
back up because you're not proven that you're secure.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.640
And then as we keep hearing all these stories about other facets of the company getting

27:17.640 --> 27:19.880
hacked, it's kind of not helping their case.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.880
No, it's not.

27:21.880 --> 27:26.160
Well, you know why the Roman Empire fell?

27:26.160 --> 27:29.280
The Roman Empire.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.600
Sony sort of said it the same way?

27:32.600 --> 27:34.400
I've been saying this for weeks now.

27:34.400 --> 27:41.800
There needs to be a major, major shakeup within the senior management at Sony and otherwise

27:41.800 --> 27:44.600
there's not going to be a PlayStation 4.

27:44.600 --> 27:49.600
I mean, I don't, or there might be one, but it's going to be overlooked.

27:49.600 --> 27:54.280
Anyhow, uh, let's move on to some more hopeful news.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.760
Um, you know, not all the news that comes out of Sony these days is bad and this could

27:57.760 --> 28:00.720
be possibly giving us a sinus and things that we could look forward to at E3.

28:00.720 --> 28:06.760
And I got to say, man, Sony, Sony is going to have, I mean, I realized Nintendo has just

28:06.760 --> 28:11.280
announced that they're showing a new fucking console at E3, but I am still most interested

28:11.280 --> 28:12.640
in Sony's press conference.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.640
I really am.

28:13.640 --> 28:19.160
Like it's either going to be the biggest like redemption ever, or it's going to be just

28:19.160 --> 28:20.440
the nail in the coffin.

28:20.440 --> 28:27.180
Like there is so much writing on Sony's press conference this year, I can't even like imagine.

28:27.180 --> 28:30.840
So I am, I'm really curious to see what their thing looks like.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.240
This might be one of the things that they're going to announce at the press conference

28:33.240 --> 28:35.240
at E3 this year.

28:35.240 --> 28:39.280
Apparently there's a God of War portable collection that is going to be coming out to the PlayStation

28:39.280 --> 28:43.260
3 in Asian regions in July.

28:43.260 --> 28:47.120
That's a press release that was sent by Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan and picked up

28:47.120 --> 28:50.220
by international gaming news websites.

28:50.220 --> 28:55.580
So apparently the God of War PSP games Chains of Olympus and Ghosts of Sparta are going

28:55.580 --> 29:01.000
to be revamped HD Chinese and English language options and will be released on July 7th in

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Asia.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.520
And of course a lot of people kind of their minds go, well, if it's coming out in Asia,

29:04.520 --> 29:06.100
why the heck isn't it coming out in the rest of the world?

29:06.100 --> 29:08.800
So this could be something that's being announced.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.800
In fact...

29:09.800 --> 29:13.620
And I mean, if it's going to be in English or, you know, if it's coming out in Asia,

29:13.620 --> 29:16.760
you can import it, even if it wasn't coming out right away.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.760
Correct.

29:17.760 --> 29:21.480
Of course it would not be unlike Sony to repackage God of War.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.840
They've done it already.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.400
The God of War collection right before God of War 3 came out.

29:26.400 --> 29:31.240
The first two PlayStation 2 games were packaged together and re-released.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.880
And then I think it's available as a download game now as well.

29:34.880 --> 29:40.400
Now taking this a step further, it might not be just God of War.

29:40.400 --> 29:46.240
Sony in fact unveiled a new initiative this week where certain PlayStation portable titles

29:46.240 --> 29:52.640
will be ported to the PlayStation 3 with improvements made that are, you know, like exactly what

29:52.640 --> 29:54.320
we're hearing about the God of War collection.

29:54.320 --> 29:58.720
So in my mind, this confirms the God of War thing because Durr, of course, they're going

29:58.720 --> 29:59.720
to do the God of War game.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.720
They already showed off.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.720
That's their biggest franchise.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.880
Was it Monster Hunter Portable 3?

30:02.880 --> 30:03.880
Yeah.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.400
And they have the trailer for it and it looks pretty awesome.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.400
Exactly.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.400
Yeah.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.960
That's the first one that's been announced for it is, thank you for taking my story,

30:09.960 --> 30:10.960
Doki.

30:10.960 --> 30:11.960
Sorry.

30:11.960 --> 30:12.960
Monster Hunter Portable 3.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.500
It's going to be released on the PlayStation 3 this summer.

30:15.500 --> 30:19.340
More game announcements from more publishers coming down the pipeline.

30:19.340 --> 30:23.440
They have not said when it's coming out in other territories, but I can't imagine it's

30:23.440 --> 30:25.360
not going to be announced at E3.

30:25.360 --> 30:29.100
And that God of War, I'm thinking is all but certain to be a part of this.

30:29.100 --> 30:33.260
The question is what other games might be included as part of this?

30:33.260 --> 30:39.000
What are the other like huge PlayStation portable titles that could be a part of this?

30:39.000 --> 30:42.480
Just throwing it out there, maybe Metal Gear Acid?

30:42.480 --> 30:43.600
I don't think they would do Acid.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.320
I think that they would do the last- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.320
The last one.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.320
I'm sorry.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.320
Peace Walker.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.320
That would be one.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.320
Certainly.

30:51.320 --> 30:54.120
Well, we'd learn about that pretty quick if that was going to be the case because Konami

30:54.120 --> 30:57.440
had probably announced it during their press conference, which would be that Sunday prior.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.920
I'm certainly looking forward to the- Unless they're told not to say that.

31:00.920 --> 31:06.120
I'm certainly hoping that those Final Fantasy remakes would be a part of it, although I

31:06.120 --> 31:07.120
doubt it.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.120
Nah.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.080
Plus, I'd be a little bit irritated because I already bought those.

31:11.080 --> 31:16.120
I would see that maybe, you know, Dissida or, you know.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
Oh, yeah.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.280
I bet that's a big one.

31:19.280 --> 31:23.120
Or the other Final Fantasy game, the seven spin-off-

31:23.120 --> 31:24.120
Crisis Core.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.120
Crisis Core, thank you.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
Yeah.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.120
Yeah.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.120
So, those are definite contenders from Squeenix, absolutely.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.040
And who's to say, I mean, they couldn't just do some of these as download games?

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
I mean, why not?

31:33.040 --> 31:35.160
I mean, that would make sense to me.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.160
Mm-hmm.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.160
Absolutely.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.280
Maybe the half-minute hero games as well?

31:39.280 --> 31:41.280
That would be cool.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.280
Yep.

31:42.280 --> 31:47.160
So, we'll- This is all but certain to show up at E3, so it's just a matter of what titles

31:47.160 --> 31:50.000
and when, so we'll see what happens with that.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.760
And what's great about it, though, is like, some of those games, you know, that were kinda,

31:54.760 --> 31:59.400
they're just alright, you know, with control-wise, because they didn't have a second analog.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.840
Well, now we can fix that.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.160
That's true.

32:02.160 --> 32:06.120
Or that little nub thing that the PSP has kinda starts to wear on your finger.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.120
Am I the only one?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.840
Like, I can't use that thing for a long period of time because it hurts.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.480
Like, just the texture on that button is yuck.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.560
I don't know.

32:14.560 --> 32:19.040
I actually had a replacement, so I could, you know, put on there, but I never had a

32:19.040 --> 32:20.040
problem with it.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.560
Alright, I guess it's just me.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
Movin' on!

32:22.560 --> 32:23.920
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

32:23.920 --> 32:26.080
There's some Mortal Kombat news out there.

32:26.080 --> 32:31.640
Basically, with the PlayStation 3, you had the combat pass so that you could, um, it's-

32:31.640 --> 32:35.440
you'd have to have it to play online, but you can only, of course, use it while PlayStation

32:35.440 --> 32:38.840
Store is online, which, of course, it wasn't, so it's being waived.

32:38.840 --> 32:43.240
Until everything is, uh, you know, pretty much back up full-time.

32:43.240 --> 32:48.200
You know, I didn't even really think about that until I'd heard about this story, because

32:48.200 --> 32:52.120
I cashed in my pass because I bought the game the day it came out, or, excuse me, I had

32:52.120 --> 32:53.880
Amazon delivery the day it came out.

32:53.880 --> 32:58.280
So I cashed in my pass that day, and the next day is when PlayStation went down, so I never

32:58.280 --> 32:59.280
had a problem.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.360
I was able to play online.

33:00.360 --> 33:04.120
But it didn't occur to me that, oh yeah, with the store being down, you can't redeem those

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
passes.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.080
So if you didn't get this game on launch day, you were screwed.

33:08.080 --> 33:14.560
So they're actually waiving the need for the pass until PlayStation Store is fully operational.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.280
And good, that's the right thing to do, but, um, I don't feel sorry for them for the amount

33:18.280 --> 33:22.880
of shit they probably got from their fan base and threatens of lawsuits and so forth, because

33:22.880 --> 33:26.280
that's what you get for putting these passes in the game in the first place, and it really

33:26.280 --> 33:27.900
doesn't just end with Mortal Kombat.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.120
This is a growing trend.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.920
Capcom, Capcom, Capcom, Capcom.

33:30.920 --> 33:31.920
Yeah.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.920
And the bummer-

33:32.920 --> 33:33.920
No, actually, you know, here's the thing.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.560
Capcom isn't doing that at all.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.280
I mean, they're doing that with their download-

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
With their DRM.

33:38.280 --> 33:42.680
Well, their DRM with their download content sucks, but they're not one of these game,

33:42.680 --> 33:46.320
you know, companies putting out this, oh, we gotta buy it new in order to play online

33:46.320 --> 33:47.320
for free.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.520
You know, that's kinda bullshit.

33:49.520 --> 33:54.600
THQ, THQ, THQ, and now Warner Brothers is kinda following suit with EA.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.640
So those are your evil three right there.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.720
And what's most interesting about this is that the people that were affected ended up

33:59.720 --> 34:03.440
being the ones who bought the game new, because nobody's buying Mortal Kombat used right now.

34:03.440 --> 34:08.160
Like, maybe one in a thousand have already given the game back, and maybe were able to

34:08.160 --> 34:12.360
get a used copy from that, but, you know, Mortal Kombat's doing very well in the sales,

34:12.360 --> 34:16.680
and this has been a successful reboot, absolutely, and, you know, people are talking about what

34:16.680 --> 34:18.080
a great game it is, including me.

34:18.080 --> 34:22.720
I think it's the best Mortal Kombat they've done since the Super Nintendo days, to be

34:22.720 --> 34:23.720
quite honest.

34:23.720 --> 34:27.280
Honestly, I think if what's gonna happen here, the whole reason that they're doing those

34:27.280 --> 34:31.040
online passes anyways is trying to recoup some money that you're losing from piracy,

34:31.040 --> 34:35.760
because if you wanna play it online, you gotta pay, you know, the ten dollars, which some

34:35.760 --> 34:39.880
people have no problem doing, especially if they've pirated the game.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.280
But I don't know.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.520
I still think it's dumb.

34:42.520 --> 34:47.900
Well, and it's especially dumb that when I am supporting the company and I buy it new,

34:47.900 --> 34:50.160
that I get locked out.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.160
You know what I mean?

34:51.160 --> 34:55.120
Or they realize that they probably had to set everything up before they could announce

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
it, so.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.800
I know, but there were certainly a few days there where they probably got a lot of shit

34:58.800 --> 34:59.800
from people.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.240
And I understand they deserved it.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.700
Even still, though, I mean, people, someone bought that copy at one time, so they already

35:04.700 --> 35:06.480
made their sale for it.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.280
Why do they need more money after the fact?

35:08.280 --> 35:09.560
Because someone else decides to play.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.000
That'd be like, you know, oh, hey, Rob, you know, I watched this DVD once and I'm gonna

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
loan it to you.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.240
You know, should the company get money for that?

35:16.240 --> 35:17.600
No, because they already bought it once.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.320
They already got the money made from that.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.500
If they wanted, you know, a pay-per-view service or something like that, then they should do

35:22.500 --> 35:23.500
something different.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.360
Let me go to our chatroom at chat.orangelauntrader.com.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.840
Tigerclaw in our chat says, not only that, anyone who bought a game that comes with a

35:29.840 --> 35:33.960
code for some DLC in the box, they can't redeem it until the store goes back up.

35:33.960 --> 35:39.560
Yeah, like, funny enough, although I redeemed the combat pass, I did not redeem my reptile

35:39.560 --> 35:43.360
original outfit that I got for buying the game, but I don't, you know, I'm a little

35:43.360 --> 35:45.000
less, it's a stupid costume.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.800
Like I'm not, the Barbie features, I'm not so bent out of shape about, you know, it doesn't

35:49.800 --> 35:52.120
really impact the game.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.840
But I mean, it's certainly still a valid point.

35:54.840 --> 35:58.840
Maybe some other games had DLC that were impacted by this.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.840
So there you go.

36:01.840 --> 36:06.160
Frisbee in our chatroom flat out says, DRM is a poison.

36:06.160 --> 36:10.040
It's such a bummer because I get why companies have to do it.

36:10.040 --> 36:14.880
I mean, obviously, piracy is an issue and it is something that has to be dealt with.

36:14.880 --> 36:19.220
But it just sucks when the people that get affected most by the change is the ones that

36:19.220 --> 36:21.240
are trying to do everything legitimately.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.060
Oh well.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.060
It never ends.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.060
Moving on.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.060
New story, Loki.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.060
Yeah.

36:28.060 --> 36:32.960
So there's a rumor that the new Nintendo console that's supposed to be announced at E3 is gonna

36:32.960 --> 36:36.080
have a front-facing camera built into the controller.

36:36.080 --> 36:41.040
Which, you know, I think that was one of the, part of the rumors that was going around for

36:41.040 --> 36:42.040
a while now.

36:42.040 --> 36:47.480
And it makes sense, so, if you think about it, if this is supposed to be, you know, a

36:47.480 --> 36:54.880
controller with a 6-inch touchscreen on it and you have a widescreen TV, hmm, could possibly

36:54.880 --> 37:03.200
they be, I don't know, adding DS or DSi download games to the virtual console or whatever they're

37:03.200 --> 37:04.800
gonna call that.

37:04.800 --> 37:09.040
Because now, you'll have your touchscreen and your one screen in your controller and

37:09.040 --> 37:11.720
your other screen is up on TV.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.720
But then, of course, I have to say is, why would you spend more money on a controller,

37:15.720 --> 37:20.440
which I'm assuming is gonna be at least 100 bucks, you know, when you can buy a DS.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.440
Or DSi.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.440
I don't know.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.440
But.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
Really?

37:24.440 --> 37:28.200
Cause when I heard about this, I was thinking more of the Kinect-style features, but I guess

37:28.200 --> 37:30.640
that doesn't work if it's on a controller, does it?

37:30.640 --> 37:31.960
I really think that one through.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.400
Let me put it this way.

37:33.400 --> 37:41.760
This sounds like this console is gonna have gimmicks out the ass.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.760
It's like, what possible gimmicks can we throw in on this thing?

37:45.760 --> 37:52.200
It's got motion controls, it's got a touchscreen, it's got a camera on it, it's got, you know,

37:52.200 --> 37:57.400
a microwave, I mean, what else can we throw on this fucking, I just have to see how they're

37:57.400 --> 38:05.820
gonna use it because, I'm gonna tell you this much, all the Nintendo gimmicks that have

38:05.820 --> 38:07.560
been out there haven't been that great.

38:07.560 --> 38:11.480
I mean, the motion control stuff, yeah, but then you get all these launch games that are

38:11.480 --> 38:16.760
all these just waggle this, waggle this one, it could have been just a button for all that.

38:16.760 --> 38:25.040
Or you know, just the Zapper, or the Wii Fit balance board, or motion plus, I mean a lot

38:25.040 --> 38:33.920
of it is just rehash, you know, or just like gimmicky game that's not really that original.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.560
It's just like all this extra crap that you don't really need in there.

38:36.560 --> 38:41.200
So if they're throwing in all these gimmicks, they gotta be doing something really smart

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
there.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.280
I think the problem why it seems like there's so many gimmicks as well is because we're

38:45.280 --> 38:48.840
in that rumor phase where just people are just fucking making shit up, and I'm not even

38:48.840 --> 38:51.600
sure I totally agree with this rumor.

38:51.600 --> 38:56.400
Like it could, I think it's just somebody making a good odds prediction.

38:56.400 --> 39:00.760
You know, cameras being integrated into devices is a pretty common thing these days, you know,

39:00.760 --> 39:02.680
between the DS and the iPhone.

39:02.680 --> 39:07.260
I think someone's just hedging their bets to make a rumor and all that stuff.

39:07.260 --> 39:10.080
So I'm not so sure that makes it true.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.440
I mean, we'll see.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.440
We'll see, I mean...

39:12.440 --> 39:17.600
But I just want to remind everyone, at one point the Wii was supposed to project 3D imagery

39:17.600 --> 39:18.600
all on its own.

39:18.600 --> 39:23.520
It was a magical little fucking box where you would just, it's the holodeck, and that

39:23.520 --> 39:28.040
didn't quite end up being the case, actually, so...

39:28.040 --> 39:33.840
I don't know, I'm just, I have very, like I said, I have very low expectations for this

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
new console.

39:34.840 --> 39:40.080
And remember, you know, the other thing too, you have to remember about Nintendo, half

39:40.080 --> 39:45.040
the stuff they promise will not make it at launch, or at all.

39:45.040 --> 39:48.240
I mean, they're going to promise you all this stuff that this console's going to be doing.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.600
Oh yeah, that feature's not done yet, it's not going to be out for six months after the

39:51.600 --> 39:52.600
console's release.

39:52.600 --> 39:57.140
Like, you know, the 3DS, I mean, come on, that's just stupid.

39:57.140 --> 40:01.560
You can't release a console that's halfway done, and then your sales are pretty shitty

40:01.560 --> 40:07.080
as it is, and then stuff that's promised at the launch of that stuff, you know, it's just

40:07.080 --> 40:08.800
delay after delay.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.400
I'm not quite as negative as Loki is on this issue.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.920
Really Nintendo really only needs to do just a couple things to make me buy the new system,

40:15.920 --> 40:20.800
as long as it's high definition and capable of pretty graphics, and it has a new F-Zero

40:20.800 --> 40:27.440
game on it, and it has a type of controller that's not quite so gimmicky where maybe,

40:27.440 --> 40:30.800
I understand there's going to be some gimmick of some sort, but as long as we can kind of

40:30.800 --> 40:33.520
tone it down a little bit, I'll be in.

40:33.520 --> 40:34.520
I'm fine.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.600
Even like two out of three ain't bad.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.800
If they don't really give me an F-Zero game, I guess I can't be that upset, but I really

40:38.800 --> 40:39.800
want it.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.400
Just say, I really, really want an F-Zero game.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.920
And now would be a perfect time.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.640
Unless this whole touch thing ends up actually being true, because I don't know how you'd

40:48.640 --> 40:52.480
incorporate that into an F-Zero game, but again, I think the touch thing is utter bullshit.

40:52.480 --> 40:57.880
Like I think it's total bullshit, but I guess we'll see, I could be wrong.

40:57.880 --> 41:02.080
Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about the 360.

41:02.080 --> 41:05.680
We've talked Sony, we've talked Nintendo, let's talk 360 for a little bit here.

41:05.680 --> 41:12.720
There is an update coming, and yeah, the firmware update, unfortunately, it's sporking some

41:12.720 --> 41:19.560
consoles from playing newer games, because it has to do with the way that they're changing

41:19.560 --> 41:22.700
the game discs to try and circumvent piracy.

41:22.700 --> 41:26.720
They're changing the retail game discs, and it's also going to be, I guess, freeing up

41:26.720 --> 41:30.400
a gig of space, which is good news for the folks that are trying to cram a lot into one

41:30.400 --> 41:31.400
disc.

41:31.400 --> 41:38.320
But the problem is, is that certain types of drives don't actually read these discs

41:38.320 --> 41:42.160
okay, so their 360s might actually be borked.

41:42.160 --> 41:47.800
Now, here's the deal, Microsoft is actually being proactive about finding where those

41:47.800 --> 41:53.560
issues are, and they're actually going to send them, I guess, a new Xbox.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.820
At least that's what the rumors say.

41:55.820 --> 41:59.940
The official Microsoft statement says, following a recent update to our system software, we

41:59.940 --> 42:04.400
have become aware of an issue that is preventing a very small number of Xbox 360 owners from

42:04.400 --> 42:06.220
playing retail game discs.

42:06.220 --> 42:10.900
This issue manifests itself as a unique disc unreadable or disc unsupported error on the

42:10.900 --> 42:14.080
screen and is unrelated to our recent public beta.

42:14.080 --> 42:19.520
We are also able to detect this issue over Xbox Live and are proactively reaching out

42:19.520 --> 42:23.160
to customers that may be impacted to replace their console.

42:23.160 --> 42:28.640
Many Xbox 360 owners receiving this error are encouraged to contact us at Xbox.com support

42:28.640 --> 42:32.120
contact, so we can verify if the console has been impacted.

42:32.120 --> 42:37.500
Very interesting, using that whole fact that they send information over the internet automatically

42:37.500 --> 42:41.660
about your console to Microsoft, they're able to tell exactly who's affected by this and

42:41.660 --> 42:43.520
send them replacements.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.520
Interesting.

42:44.520 --> 42:50.600
Of course, they don't say exactly what percentage, I mean, they say a small amount, but how small?

42:50.600 --> 42:52.920
It's a certain drive, I believe, that doesn't work with it.

42:52.920 --> 42:57.420
I don't remember which kind, but there is one that I know that the update doesn't work

42:57.420 --> 42:58.420
on it.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.420
Interesting.

42:59.420 --> 43:04.720
It's also one of the, I think, one of the consoles that they haven't had, like, hacked

43:04.720 --> 43:10.840
firmware or, like, new hacked firmwares for because, I guess, like, the AP 2.5 checks

43:10.840 --> 43:13.520
aren't able to be flashed to it and all this stuff.

43:13.520 --> 43:17.720
I wonder if it's the original 360s, but they've all red ringed by now anyway, so that's why

43:17.720 --> 43:18.960
it's such a small number.

43:18.960 --> 43:24.800
It is one of the original, I think, drives, one of the, either the Samsung Hitachi or

43:24.800 --> 43:25.800
the...

43:25.800 --> 43:26.800
Interesting.

43:26.800 --> 43:29.800
I don't remember the last one there.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.600
Toshiba.

43:31.600 --> 43:37.080
By the way, also speaking about Xbox 360, PayPal has been rolling out in certain territories.

43:37.080 --> 43:43.640
There's an automatic update that was going out, and it's going to certain regions first,

43:43.640 --> 43:48.220
and now you can actually use PayPal as a billing option on your console.

43:48.220 --> 43:52.440
You can do that for Microsoft Points and other types of Marketplace content.

43:52.440 --> 43:56.160
Apparently, that has all been rolling out over the past week.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.960
I don't remember updating my console, but it might have been done when I wasn't on it.

43:58.960 --> 43:59.960
They haven't been...

43:59.960 --> 44:03.480
Like, I didn't get an update on Friday for my consoles.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.520
So it's just certain regions right now.

44:05.520 --> 44:10.380
May 27th is when Avatar Connect is scheduled to come out, and that is the...

44:10.380 --> 44:14.920
If you are too shy to use voice chat, or I'm sorry, video chat, because you know your

44:14.920 --> 44:19.440
Connect has video chat, but if you want to use fake people instead to chat, you'll be

44:19.440 --> 44:22.000
able to do that on the 27th.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.440
Interesting.

44:24.440 --> 44:27.480
Let's move on with another news story, and then we'll get to the release dates.

44:27.480 --> 44:33.160
Well, going back to Microsoft, there has been word about something that, according to our

44:33.160 --> 44:36.280
show role, is the Connect Fub Lab.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.280
I'm sorry.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.920
Sorry, I have fubby, fat fingers, and I think I meant to type fun.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.640
I had to give you a hard time.

44:42.640 --> 44:49.040
Now, the Connect Fun Lab might be revealed at E3.

44:49.040 --> 44:53.600
They are going to be doing a lot of stuff for the Connect, but there is a source that

44:53.600 --> 44:59.520
said that something called Connect Fun Lab is in the works to be revealed there, and

44:59.520 --> 45:01.600
not really sure what it is.

45:01.600 --> 45:06.260
There's also another possible Connect title that's called Connect Me that's on the Australia

45:06.260 --> 45:10.280
Classifications Board and has Microsoft as a publisher.

45:10.280 --> 45:16.000
And there's also two others that are probably not Connect games, but there's Crimson Alliance

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
and Fusion Genesis.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.920
And Crimson Alliance is being developed by Certain Affinity.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.080
Fusion Genesis?

45:24.080 --> 45:25.920
I know what that is.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.480
That's another Fusion Frenzy game.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.480
I know, God, I hate that.

45:29.480 --> 45:30.800
God, I hope not.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.320
And then Crimson Alliance, that sounds like another Crimson Skies game, which sounds kind

45:34.320 --> 45:35.500
of cool.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.720
But Fusion Frenzy, no!

45:37.720 --> 45:41.000
Crimson Alliance is by Certain Affinity, and they did Age of Booty.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Oh.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Well.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.560
I still don't know if that's what it is, but Fusion Frenzy, ohhhh!

45:47.560 --> 45:49.120
Bleh, bleh.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.640
It's terrible.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.120
Don't make another Fusion Frenzy game.

45:52.120 --> 45:54.120
They're all terrible.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.120
Alright.

45:55.120 --> 46:00.440
Uh, I, I hope, hopefully that isn't what it is, but I'm a little more worried about Connect

46:00.440 --> 46:05.640
Fun Lab, because I thought that this year was the year we're going to see at E3 what the

46:05.640 --> 46:07.200
Connect can really do.

46:07.200 --> 46:10.480
Alright, we've seen all the Nintendo rip-offs, now let's see what the Connect can really

46:10.480 --> 46:11.480
do.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.480
It can really rip off Nintendo now.

46:12.480 --> 46:17.360
I know, and I hear Fun Lab, and I think, oh goody, it's a lab full of minigames.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.960
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.240
Or it's all puppies.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
It's all lab puppies.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.240
Ugh.

46:23.240 --> 46:28.600
I hope Fun Lab has to do with, like, genetic mutations of, like, you know, people and...

46:28.600 --> 46:29.600
Make your own monster.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600
Yes.

46:30.600 --> 46:31.600
Create your own alien or something.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.600
That would be fun.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.600
I don't want fucking minigames.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.600
Exactly.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
That would be Fun Lab.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
And then you make them fight through Xbox Live.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.600
Yes.

46:37.600 --> 46:38.600
And it's okay.

46:38.600 --> 46:39.600
Kind of like Magic Pen Gel.

46:39.600 --> 46:40.600
It's all virtual.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.600
It's not real.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.600
Yeah.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.600
There you go.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.600
A Magic Pen Gel where I draw with my hands.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.640
I smear paint to make creatures.

46:47.640 --> 46:50.320
Like it's a monkey smearing poop on the wall.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.440
That would be great.

46:51.440 --> 46:52.440
Fun Lab.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.440
I would play that.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.440
Monkey Poo Fun Lab.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.820
I would play that.

46:56.820 --> 46:58.280
Monkey Poo Fun Lab.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.600
Alright.

46:59.600 --> 47:02.320
Let's go around the world and look at some release dates.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.760
That sounds terrible, Monkey Poo Fun Lab.

47:05.760 --> 47:10.040
This week, actually, there's some decent stuff coming out.

47:10.040 --> 47:19.120
Dirt 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week, which is pretty cool.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.400
Adding Gymkhana this time.

47:21.400 --> 47:25.720
Kung Fu Panda 2, another movie tie-in game.

47:25.720 --> 47:29.840
And this one, it's a little weird, they're doing something different on every single

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
platform.

47:30.840 --> 47:34.480
The PlayStation 3 game is just, you know, just a PlayStation 3 game.

47:34.480 --> 47:38.480
The Xbox 360 is getting a Kinect game.

47:38.480 --> 47:42.400
The Wii is getting a U-Draw game.

47:42.400 --> 47:47.360
And then DS is just, you know, another regular DS game.

47:47.360 --> 47:51.040
So those will be out later this week.

47:51.040 --> 47:58.760
And then, let's see here, man this is fucking slow today.

47:58.760 --> 48:01.960
Other fun stuff.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.600
Like what?

48:03.600 --> 48:06.080
Like Monkey Poo Smear.

48:06.080 --> 48:07.320
Monkey Poo Smear, yes.

48:07.320 --> 48:11.920
Monkey Poo Smear is coming out this week on all platforms, including the Atari.

48:11.920 --> 48:12.920
Looks very exciting.

48:12.920 --> 48:16.520
No, um, I'm trying to see what else we have here.

48:16.520 --> 48:22.860
It's a really small week, but I know it's more than just those two titles.

48:22.860 --> 48:25.700
Come on, cooperate.

48:25.700 --> 48:26.700
There we go.

48:26.700 --> 48:30.920
Dungeons and Dragons Daggerdale for PC, that's coming out this week.

48:30.920 --> 48:37.060
Also Naughty Bear, the Gold Edition, in case you didn't buy that game.

48:37.060 --> 48:41.240
It's coming out now with all the download content at a budget price on PlayStation 3

48:41.240 --> 48:43.640
and Xbox 360.

48:43.640 --> 48:48.640
NASCAR 2011 on the Wii, been delayed a little bit so now it's finally coming out.

48:48.640 --> 48:54.080
Paws and Claws Pampered Pets 2 for Nintendo DS, out this week as well.

48:54.080 --> 48:59.280
And Murder in Venice, kind of an adventure game that's also for DS.

48:59.280 --> 49:04.040
Cake Mania Main Street, that's on DS this week.

49:04.040 --> 49:10.440
And that is pretty much it.

49:10.440 --> 49:17.600
Well we have some news for the U.S., for overseas in the UK.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.520
And it's actually just a few games.

49:19.520 --> 49:26.640
On the 24th we have Dirt 3 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.

49:26.640 --> 49:29.680
And we also have Kung Fu Panda for the DS.

49:29.680 --> 49:33.960
And on the 27th is Gladiator Begins on the PSP.

49:33.960 --> 49:38.680
And on the 30th we have Fable 3 for PC, which why it's taken so dang long to come out, oh

49:38.680 --> 49:39.680
well, don't know.

49:39.680 --> 49:41.920
But I don't know.

49:41.920 --> 49:45.560
Fable 3, I will go ahead and warn our UK viewers.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.960
Now I've got friends that love, why do I say viewers, it's listeners.

49:48.960 --> 49:54.040
I've got friends that love Fable 3, but it's really not all that great.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.360
Fable 2 is so much of a better game.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.360
What do you think?

49:59.360 --> 50:04.280
Fable 2 is alright, but Fable 3 didn't look like they added too much stuff to it, so I

50:04.280 --> 50:06.880
passed on it.

50:06.880 --> 50:11.560
I can't trust anything Peter Milano says, he's full of shit.

50:11.560 --> 50:13.680
That means that he needs to probably go potty.

50:13.680 --> 50:14.680
Yes.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.680
Except every time he potties a new game comes out.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.320
That's true.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.320
Yeah.

50:19.320 --> 50:25.880
And, well, I have really nothing else on, for UK, I mean, they list games but they don't

50:25.880 --> 50:29.840
put dates on them, like Back to the Future Double Vision is on the list, but they didn't

50:29.840 --> 50:32.320
put a date on it, so.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.320
That's all.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.800
And speaking of stuff that's coming out.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.400
Can we go to Japan and take a look at the Japanese releases?

50:40.400 --> 50:41.400
Yes.

50:41.400 --> 50:47.280
Oh, let's see, we're gonna start off on the Xbox 360 and this week on the 26th, Akai Katana

50:47.280 --> 50:49.760
Shin comes out on the 360.

50:49.760 --> 50:52.840
And that is gonna be in regular and limited edition.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.640
And now that's from Cave.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.120
That's it?

50:56.120 --> 50:58.560
Akai Katana Shin comes out this week.

50:58.560 --> 51:00.120
That's Red Katana New?

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
Death?

51:01.120 --> 51:05.320
It takes place in a parallel world that resembles Japan's Taisho period.

51:05.320 --> 51:09.320
Here people discovered a blood sword that takes human sacrifices to unleash its mass

51:09.320 --> 51:10.960
destructive power.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.120
That would be Red Sword Death then.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.320
Now this is an existing game that's already been out.

51:15.320 --> 51:19.680
The 360 version will have new stages, new characters, and a new system, and the graphics

51:19.680 --> 51:20.680
will fit in a 16-9.

51:20.680 --> 51:25.360
So I'm assuming this is a prior 16, I'm sorry, a prior PlayStation 2 release.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.800
So that is coming out this week and it's a shooter.

51:28.800 --> 51:29.800
Of course, it's a shooter.

51:29.800 --> 51:30.800
It's Cave.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.800
What'd you expect?

51:31.800 --> 51:37.040
Also coming out on the Xbox 360, Fighters Uncaged and Troy Musou comes out this week.

51:37.040 --> 51:42.640
And I'm not sure what this, oh this is about like, like Trojan Troy, Helen of Troy, all

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
that stuff.

51:43.640 --> 51:49.360
It's myth, oh, Warriors Legend of Troy for Japan?

51:49.360 --> 51:54.080
diversity Warriors, but with the Trojan horse, not the Trojan condoms with the Trojan horse.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.800
That'll be a whole nother type of game.

51:56.800 --> 52:03.840
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Hiro no Kakira Aizoban Akane Hiro no Suyoku comes out this

52:03.840 --> 52:07.600
week from Idea Factory in regular and limited edition.

52:07.600 --> 52:11.000
And this game is an adventure game.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.480
I'm trying to see what it is.

52:14.480 --> 52:19.480
It's gotta be something that I've heard of before because it's regular and limited.

52:19.480 --> 52:23.320
Let me see, trying to get some screenshots here and it's an adventure game.

52:23.320 --> 52:25.000
No, I guess not.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.120
The artwork on this does not look familiar to me.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.800
So it's some type of new game we don't have here.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.280
Well, yeah, it looks like every other.

52:33.280 --> 52:37.160
Infamous goes into the best series, meaning it gets a price reduction.

52:37.160 --> 52:41.740
Nobunaga no Yabu, Tendo and a power-up kit, woohoo, come out this week.

52:41.740 --> 52:46.360
That's 124 bucks if you want both of those to import.

52:46.360 --> 52:54.080
Also, Tottori no Atlier, Arland no Rekin ju Shutsi 2 goes into the best hits collection

52:54.080 --> 52:55.560
as well.

52:55.560 --> 52:58.320
So some price reductions this week.

52:58.320 --> 53:01.480
Going to the Nintendo systems, taking a look real quick.

53:01.480 --> 53:06.740
Nintendo Wii, Pandora's Tower, Until I Return to Your Side comes out on the Wii this week.

53:06.740 --> 53:09.280
And of course I hear Pandora and I go, wait a minute, wasn't that what they call the Kid

53:09.280 --> 53:10.520
Icarus games over in Japan?

53:10.520 --> 53:14.400
It was called like Pandora's, I thought this was what it was called, Pandora's Adventure

53:14.400 --> 53:15.400
or something like that.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.600
Wasn't Kid Icarus called that in Japan?

53:18.600 --> 53:22.040
But that is not what this is, just so you know, it is not like a Kid Icarus game.

53:22.040 --> 53:24.020
It's some other type of game on the Wii.

53:24.020 --> 53:27.240
And it's in a black box instead of a white Wii box.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.040
So ooh.

53:29.040 --> 53:37.160
Let's see, going on to the Nintendo 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP comes out this week.

53:37.160 --> 53:42.920
And lastly, going to the PSP, Shutsugeki, what?

53:42.920 --> 53:49.680
Kid Icarus Hikari Shinwa, Palthena no Kagami, which is Light Myth Palthena's Mirror.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.680
Palthena's Mirror, not Pandora, Palthena.

53:51.680 --> 53:54.200
Okay, so I missed, P something.

53:54.200 --> 53:56.280
But it had like a totally different name in Japan.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.520
At least I was like 20% right.

53:58.520 --> 53:59.840
That's a much cooler name.

53:59.840 --> 54:03.120
It is kind of a cool name, but I don't know, Kid Icarus kind of grew on me.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.120
It's cool.

54:04.120 --> 54:14.280
Anyhow, the game I was reading on the PSP, Shutsugeki no Senjotou comes out from System

54:14.280 --> 54:17.680
Soft this week on the PSP.

54:17.680 --> 54:23.280
And this is a strategy game that involves anime chicks in hot outfits.

54:23.280 --> 54:26.400
And then like, okay, look at these screenshots, okay?

54:26.400 --> 54:28.760
You get like hot anime babe, right?

54:28.760 --> 54:32.060
And then you have like anime babes in like little maid outfits, right?

54:32.060 --> 54:37.800
And then it's driving in the streets with tanks and airplanes.

54:37.800 --> 54:40.880
This is a very manly sort of game.

54:40.880 --> 54:45.040
Hot anime babes and then tanks and fighter jets.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.800
Awesome.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.400
Pre-ordering it today.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.760
All right.

54:50.760 --> 54:54.600
Let's move on and go over a couple more news stories and we'll get into the classic game

54:54.600 --> 54:55.600
of the week.

54:55.600 --> 54:59.360
Dark Soccer has picked a very popular series tonight.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.360
So we'll get to that.

55:00.360 --> 55:03.080
All right, for now though, Loki.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.320
Ah yes.

55:04.320 --> 55:09.240
So this is kind of disappointing because this was actually a game I was looking forward

55:09.240 --> 55:19.680
to checking out once the delayed Nintendo store for the 3DS was released.

55:19.680 --> 55:23.400
But yes, like all things delayed, there are more delays.

55:23.400 --> 55:27.920
And Mega Man Legends 3 prototype version, a demo for a game that's not even finished

55:27.920 --> 55:37.240
yet, will be delayed from the 3DS eShop launch on June 6th.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.600
That is terrible.

55:38.600 --> 55:41.520
And they haven't really said yet when it's going to be released.

55:41.520 --> 55:53.000
But I guess you have to wait.

55:53.000 --> 56:00.200
And this is for that demo, basically, of the potential Mega Man Legends 3 game that might

56:00.200 --> 56:05.680
come out should enough people pay to get this demo concept of what it could possibly be.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.480
Yeah, that's a big ol' fuck you to Capcom.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.480
I'm sorry.

56:08.480 --> 56:17.680
Oh well, you know, we may make this game, but you have to pay for this demo and we may.

56:17.680 --> 56:18.680
We'll see.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.120
To be honest, I'll probably buy it anyway.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.600
As long as, okay, here's my little stipulation.

56:23.600 --> 56:27.200
I guess we won't really know because of course we're not going to get told, but my wish is

56:27.200 --> 56:33.080
as long as the game I'm not buying here in the DS shop ends up being a part of the actual

56:33.080 --> 56:34.260
full game.

56:34.260 --> 56:38.480
Like I do not want to be paying for what will be the first two chapters of the retail release.

56:38.480 --> 56:42.740
Like a side story or a leading into game, those are fine.

56:42.740 --> 56:45.320
Like a case zero is perfectly acceptable.

56:45.320 --> 56:46.320
That's fine.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.120
But I don't want something that's just going to end up being like the first chapter of

56:49.120 --> 56:50.120
the game.

56:50.120 --> 56:54.480
I, you know, Capcom was also behind the Dead Rising case zero, which was actually a pretty

56:54.480 --> 56:55.960
cool little idea.

56:55.960 --> 57:02.000
So my hope is they're going to get this one right too, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.080
L.A. Noire is a game that a lot of people are talking about this week and it's a very

57:06.080 --> 57:08.600
kind of different sort of rock star game from what I understand.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.360
People are going into it expecting 1940s Grand Theft Auto.

57:11.360 --> 57:15.960
That's not quite what they're getting, but the game seems to be pretty well received

57:15.960 --> 57:20.400
unless you're one of these people that are affected by the overheating.

57:20.400 --> 57:26.880
Apparently firmware 3.61 on the PlayStation 3 is causing certain Sony consoles to overheat

57:26.880 --> 57:29.360
when playing L.A. Noire.

57:29.360 --> 57:32.080
This is according to Rockstar's own customer support.

57:32.080 --> 57:37.520
Quote, we have received some reports of PlayStation 3's overheating while playing L.A. Noire or

57:37.520 --> 57:42.960
beeping three times before shutting down and turning themselves off, mostly on older 60

57:42.960 --> 57:44.480
and 80 gig fat models.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.960
Oh shit, I have one of these models.

57:46.960 --> 57:52.560
Primary reports seem to be that updating to firmware 3.61 will cause PlayStations to overheat.

57:52.560 --> 57:56.080
There have been various reports of this on a few different games now, all reporting their

57:56.080 --> 58:00.440
PlayStation 3's turning off or red lighting after having installed 3.61.

58:00.440 --> 58:01.440
Yikes.

58:01.440 --> 58:07.840
Well now, if you're an Xbox fan boy pointing and laughing and kicking Sony while they're

58:07.840 --> 58:09.560
down, hold it.

58:09.560 --> 58:10.560
Because guess what?

58:10.560 --> 58:16.120
Apparently the Xbox 360 version is locking up as well.

58:16.120 --> 58:20.560
According to a poster on the Xbox.com forums, quote, it's been freezing since the first

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
mission.

58:21.560 --> 58:24.360
Now I'm about four in and it won't stop freezing.

58:24.360 --> 58:29.080
Rockstar has advised that folks, quote, clear the 360 cache.

58:29.080 --> 58:34.920
So there are reported instances that Microsoft's system is having issues with this as well.

58:34.920 --> 58:40.520
So Rockstar, you know, of course was blaming Sony originally, but now that the Xbox stuff

58:40.520 --> 58:43.560
is coming to light, they've changed a little bit.

58:43.560 --> 58:47.600
Here's their latest statement, quote, we've received a very small number of customer support

58:47.600 --> 58:52.080
questions about PS3s overheating or shutting down while playing LA Noire.

58:52.080 --> 58:56.720
At this time, Rockstar Games and Sony can confirm that neither LA Noire or firmware

58:56.720 --> 59:00.840
update 3.61 are causing the PS3 hardware to overheat.

59:00.840 --> 59:04.640
We are both committed to working hard to find solutions to this and any issues that may

59:04.640 --> 59:05.640
arise.

59:05.640 --> 59:09.880
Well, if that isn't the vaguest fucking thing I've ever heard, it's not the game and it's

59:09.880 --> 59:11.240
not the system.

59:11.240 --> 59:14.920
And there's really nothing else between that that would cause your system to overheat.

59:14.920 --> 59:19.600
It's just you is really what I'm hearing in that statement.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.520
It's not the system and it's not the game.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.000
It's just you.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.280
It's not me, it's you.

59:26.280 --> 59:29.700
I mean, what the fuck kind of press release is that?

59:29.700 --> 59:34.680
Why not say we recognize the problem and we are working on a solution?

59:34.680 --> 59:35.920
Oh, my God.

59:35.920 --> 59:39.040
How hard was that?

59:39.040 --> 59:40.040
Very hard.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.520
Not like Sony hasn't got bigger problems right now.

59:42.520 --> 59:46.280
This is more just that corporate bullshit.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.200
Like stop it.

59:48.200 --> 59:50.320
Just be real with the consumers.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.960
We see through your crap.

59:52.960 --> 59:54.860
Yes.

59:54.860 --> 01:00:00.880
We need to go back into a time when gaming wasn't so full of such asshattery and bullshit.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:08.080
And it's a segment we call the classic game of the week, where we turn back the clock,

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.240
take a stroll down memory lane and find a classic game in the archives.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:15.240
The Dark Sakura says, hey, listen up, brats.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.680
You should be playing this game or I'll set your PlayStation 3 on fire myself.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.880
You won't even need L anymore.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.960
I'll have my engineers invent combustible lemons that'll burn your PS3 down.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960
There you go.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.320
What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320
Mother.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:41.640
Mother is, well, as we all know, is the precursor to Mother 2, which came out over here as Earthbound.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:52.560
Now this was, it came out on the Famicon and it came out in, I'm trying to find the year

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.400
and it doesn't list the year on here.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.400
1989.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.400
Yeah, 1989.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400
Sorry.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.560
And it was actually, it was published by Nintendo.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.760
It was produced by Miyamoto and written by Shigesato Itoi.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.800
So has some fantastic names behind it.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.000
It was developed by Ape and Panexsoftica and Nintendo Tokyo.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.640
At any rate, it was an RPG.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:24.720
It never had a release outside of Japan, although it was initially supposed to be released.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.240
They had already started localizing it to be the first Earthbound.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.240
And basically that's also when the SNES was coming out.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.480
And so they decided to use Mother 2 instead.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.080
They localized that.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.920
So there is an official localized prototype of the game and that was actually put out

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.000
by Demiforce.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:53.600
They used the ROM data that was from the prototype and it's being put out as Earthbound Zero.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.480
And that actually made it out in 1998.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:03.400
The game itself has field maps and a battle system.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.400
It doesn't use, it doesn't use an overworld map.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:14.600
It just basically, sorry, my throat's getting messed up.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.440
Basically you can go around and talk to other NPCs, you can buy equipment, items.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.320
You can, you know, stay in hotels, you can go to other buildings.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.780
And in the, if you use a telephone, you can actually, your character can talk to Daddy

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.780
who gives you money.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.640
And he saves your progress.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.400
The main character's name is Ninten by the way, I thought that's funny.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.880
So when you are on the field map, because like I said it doesn't have an overworld map

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.040
just as field maps, you will be attacked by enemies and then you go into battle mode where

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.280
it's a first person view.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:56.880
And you attack the creature or whatever, like a lamp, through the different menu system

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.200
commands and you have different actions for different characters.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:09.720
And you also can do different moves in order that are based on the character's speed statistics.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.420
And you also of course get experience and level up that way.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.440
And if you lose all of your hit points, then you go to the hospital and you have to pay

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.000
to revive your characters.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.280
And if every character dies, you don't lose your progress, but you go back to the last

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.000
area that you saved at with only Ninten alive and half of your money.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.320
So that's kind of crappy, huh?

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.320
So at any rate.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.320
That's harsh.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.800
That sounds harder than the pirated version of Earthbound where it would delete your own

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.120
saved game when you got to the last boss, remember that?

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120
Yeah.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.280
Oh, after doubling the difficulty?

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.980
At any rate, the game talks about a married couple in America who vanished after a dark

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.120
shadow covered their town.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:07.780
Two years later, George, the husband, returns mysteriously and then he starts studying in

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.320
complete seclusion and his wife Maria is never heard from again.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:18.420
So you fast forward to 1988 where there's a 12 year old boy named Ninten who is attacked

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.740
by a paranormal event.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.320
And actually he looks a lot like Ness.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.240
Of course, Ness was the one in Earthbound.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.200
So he's got psychic powers and he likes penguins, Rob.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200
Smart kid.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.840
He likes penguins.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:44.880
So at any rate, he finds out that an invading race is, an alien race is, you know, invading

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.480
and so they go to the world of Magicant where the ruler there, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.880
find her a song called the Eight Melodies and play it to her.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.780
Play all the songs to her.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:06.000
So he meets up with a dude named Lloyd and a girl named Ana and she dreamed about him.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Ooh.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.680
So that's the start of the game and you keep, you know, going through and you duel some

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:23.240
dude named Teddy and you have to, it's actually funny because you have to, the Queen tells

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.000
you about an alien named, I'm hoping that I'm pronouncing this right, but I think it's

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.840
Gigu, that's spelled G-Y-I-Y-G or something, but it's Gigu, which is actually the same

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:42.800
way it was initially romanized for Earthbound in the unreleased translation.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:49.060
So it pretty much, you know, more fun going saving the universe and the game actually

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:57.560
did get a re-release in 2003 with Mother 2 and the tagline was no crying until the end

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.520
and a guaranteed masterpiece.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:08.880
So it was actually designed by a Japanese copywriter and television personality Shigesato

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.720
Itoi and the inspiration for the game was from John Lennon's song Mother and he also

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.140
wanted the game to have a name that wasn't game-like.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.400
I didn't know that part, that's interesting.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.540
And I like this quote here, it said that the last parts of Mother were not tested for bugs

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:32.240
and balance issues and when talking about it at a promotional event he humorously stated

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.400
when we got to fine-tuning the difficulty there I was like whatever.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:42.880
So yeah there's a lot of people and I've started playing it a while back but never really got

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:48.100
too much further into it who says this is a game that you have to grind and grind and

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.540
grind and grind to get through.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:57.480
So at any rate, like I said it was going to be put out in the US as Earthbound, actually

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.440
two words, Earthbound.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.240
And the localization was finished in 1990 but the release kept getting pushed back into

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.300
fall of 1991 and then it got put on hold.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:16.200
So the guy who was the producer and script writer, Phil Sandhop, he said and I'm quoting

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:22.640
once the NES squatted in the pipeline and shoved the game aside from its appointed time

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.840
I believe that the marketing execs just decided that the game would be too expensive to produce

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.600
and unsuccessful without marketing and that's why it fell into oblivion.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.800
They were doing a lot of stuff in localization which was removing blood from enemy sprites

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.440
which was a censorship thing they had at the time and they were going to extend the game's

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440
ending.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:47.120
So at any rate, Demiforce, as I mentioned before, found a beta cartridge on the internet

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.400
and they collected enough money to buy the game.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.280
I remember when that happened, I was in college and that was all going on.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:01.440
And so they actually had to do modified versions with the copy protection disabled and renamed

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.360
it Earthbound Zero so that it could separate it from Earthbound.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:15.040
And they actually put everything out, I mean I thought it was neat that they bought the

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.200
rights to do it so that was pretty cool.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:27.880
The music in it was done by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka and it was actually released

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:38.040
on CD and cassette by Sony on August 21st, 1989 and it had 11 tracks and 7 of them are

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
vocal remakes.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:47.560
So it's got the 8 melodies on there, one called Pollyanna and actually on February 18th, 2004

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.400
the soundtrack was re-released, digitally remastered and songs from it appear in Earthbound,

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:57.640
Mother 3, Super Smash Bros Melee and Super Smash Bros Brawl.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:05.880
So there's actually some pretty big names that were included with the CD, including

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.220
the St. Paul's Cathedral Choir.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:16.080
It sold 400,000 copies in Japan and in two pulls by Famitsu it was the 9th best game

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.960
for the Famicon and the 38th best game of all time.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.080
It was the 4th most wanted virtual console game in June 2008 according to Nintendo Power

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.520
and moved up to the 2nd most wanted.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:33.520
So it was called Dark and Mature and that's the game.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.200
Alright, your classic game of the week, Mother or Earthbound Zero, the original that most

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.320
folks in the US have never seen.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.320
Yep.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.320
Alright.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.800
Good pick, that's a great series and you know that series had a lot of rabid fans.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.580
It does seem ridiculous that Nintendo really just kind of let it die.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:57.000
I mean, I think I get some of the reasons behind it but I don't know, it was a pretty

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.440
cute little RPG franchise that Nintendo had and it's just kind of a bummer that they couldn't

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440
work around some of that.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.160
Like I understand maybe why things can't be re-released but it's a bummer they can't,

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:11.600
you know, get that, you know, the same kind of like concept and the whole modern RPG thing

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.200
and kind of make it work with the new game but maybe some things are just left better

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.200
as classics.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.840
Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a break but don't go anywhere

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.840
guys.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:26.240
We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a break.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.880
Coming up after the break, we've got stories about Portal 2.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.040
Apparently, some folks find that game highly offensive when we're talking about who and

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.000
why in a little while.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.960
Some other Portal 2 news and E3 news already starting to come in, how you can actually

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.280
go to one of the press conferences.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.240
We're going to talk a little bit about that when we come back after a quick break with

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:53.880
more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.360
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:02.280
We are live on this Sunday, May the 22nd of 2011 with the 414th episode of our show.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.480
We're on into part B tonight.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.560
We're going to get into some rapid fire news and your Twitter topics at twitter.com

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:12.400
slash O-L-R. We're going to get into those in just a minute but first some quick plugs

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.280
for some other projects that we do which we actually referenced already at the top of

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.320
the show but we're going to sell them again because you know what?

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.240
We don't really advertise anything on this show except our other shows.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240
So here's your commercial.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.800
Darcyra what's your show?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:33.920
Comic Insanity which is at Infamous.net N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net and we talk about comics but we also

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:43.480
have a new segment where we talk about a classic comic of the week and we also have what Shadow

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.680
calls the random encounter which is talking about an old RPG.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.280
Classic RPG so.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280
Very cool.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.440
Throwing a little video game spin in your comic show.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.440
A little bit.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.440
You're trying to leave us aren't you?

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.480
No never never never never never.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.560
This is my big baby.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.160
Your big nine year old crying bratty baby that says shit a lot.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160
Yes.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.160
I'm going to have to wash its mouth out with some lye soap.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160
But anyway.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.680
But yeah we talk comics and it's me and Mari and Marvel and Dan Shadow and we're awesome!

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.720
Listen to us we go live every Tuesday.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720
Alright.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:28.320
If you like the wow chat that we do at the top of the show sometimes during our gaming

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.840
weeks there's a whole other show I have with my buddy Extover all about the World of Warcraft

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.280
it's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth www.hordehouse.com and I promise you

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.280
this week actually well the show that's on the feed right now because we tape Thursdays

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.880
and we post Thursdays night the show that's on the feed right now is the one with Dark

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.240
Soccer on it so it's a great episode.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240
Yep.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.440
I promise on this week's show there's going to be a shocking revelation that I'm going

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.160
to get tons of shit for.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.560
It's going to be a hatin' on Rob episode.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560
Guess what?

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.560
What?

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.600
Also I was in my pajamas the entire time it was awesome.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600
Awesome.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.320
So hordehouse.com if you want more information like that.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.520
No I have not quit WoW and I have not resigned my account so get those thoughts out of your

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520
head.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.920
I always threaten to do it whenever Blizzard does something it pisses me off but I have

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.680
yet to so it's not that.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.680
Alright anyhow let's get into some rapid fire news and then we'll get into the Twitter topics

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.680
after that.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.680
Some quick stories that we want to throw at you although we don't have a whole lot of

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.080
time to discuss them.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080
Loki.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080
Ah yes.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:39.200
No More Heroes Heroes Paradise is coming August 16th to North American regions.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:45.160
It's basically the port of No More Heroes Red Zone that's coming out in Japan.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.720
Basically No More Heroes HD graphics with the move support and also you can play it

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:56.140
non move as well with some additional bosses I guess from No More Heroes 2.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:01.680
So that's pretty awesome if you want to check that out it's coming out August 16th on PlayStation

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.680
3.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.700
Maybe a new Carmageddon being announced at E3 this year coming from Square Enix apparently

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:18.560
they have a countdown on the Carmageddon.com website and it is counting down to June 1st

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.520
so maybe an announcement.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.660
It's so weird because when I think of Squeenix I don't think of Carmageddon I think of role

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.080
playing games and dudes with big hair but I keep forgetting oh yeah they have Eidos

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:33.800
now and that's where the Tomb Raider comes from and all that other stuff so it's interesting.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.640
And then finally if you have a homebrew enabled PSP there's some pretty cool stuff you can

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:46.480
do with that including the PSP 3D plugin version 2.0 it's been released it enables 3D for select

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:55.360
PSP games and this is of course the old school cyan red glasses that you can wear and you

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.080
can actually play quite a few games in 3D they just added support for Crisis Core, God

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.120
Eater Burst, FIFA 11, and the third birthday.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.480
And there's a pretty extensive list of games that actually are supported by Despicable

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:21.000
Me, Piscate, Ridge Racer 2, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Grip Shift, lots of big titles

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.360
Dead to the Right's Reckoning, Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron so a little bit of a mix of

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:33.280
everything including Eye of Judgment Legends still won't sell them all the copies.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.160
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com Dungeon Buster says Carmageddon was so fun

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:42.320
and Amiga777 says Carmageddon was Eidos' baby no not necessarily it's just that when I think

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.520
of Squeenix I don't really think of Carmageddon I think of like role playing games and stuff

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:48.240
and I realize they've done some other stuff throughout their history that wasn't quite

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:54.200
like that but I just I don't know I think of the other stuff but then Eidos is you know

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:59.960
kind of the company that was a little more you know America developed games and UK developed

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.720
games and stuff and not so heavy on the Japanese influence until now these two companies have

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.560
come together so it's just interesting that's all.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.620
Alright moving on speaking of Final Fantasy and Squeenix Final Fantasy Tactics is going

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:19.200
to be coming to the iPhone in late June mid-July and then it will be on the iPad after that

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.580
this of course is the PlayStation update if you will of Final Fantasy Tactics although

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:29.000
I don't know to be honest if the other Squeenix IOS games are anything to go by they really

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.840
have kind of souped up the games quite a bit so I don't think this is going to be just

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.560
a port it sounds like there'll be some extra stuff in this now what's interesting about

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.960
this the game was originally supposed to come out at Spring 2011 it was announced at last

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.100
year's E3 so here we are a year later and still no game so I don't know if that's just

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.680
they had a lot of paint to polish on it or maybe they decided to do more with it than

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.440
they had originally who knows but the iPad version of the game will come out a little

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.720
bit later than the iPhone version this is because of the higher resolution Square does

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.360
say one thing they are doing redoing some of the artwork for the higher resolution so

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.800
that's pretty awesome actually so take a look at that.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:14.480
Alan Wake is apparently getting a new game on Xbox Live Arcade it's not quite what you

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.160
think it's not like a sequel or anything but it's a game called Alan Wake's Night Springs

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:24.080
this is a rumor right now it's nothing that's been confirmed but this makes a lot of sense

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:29.200
Alan Wake was a pretty awesome game but unfortunately came out at kind of a bad time and got really

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.460
overlooked by a lot of people but it has its fans so Xbox Live Arcade seems to be a good

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:38.760
place to kind of feel out maybe a real sequel but here's the deal Alan Wake's Night Springs

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:45.720
if you've played Alan Wake Night Springs is kind of the show within the show Alan Wake

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.560
really reminds me of Twin Peaks but as a video and when I say Twin Peaks like the old show

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.960
from 1990 with Kyle MacLachlan and David Lynch was the guy behind it right who killed Laura

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.140
Palmer Alan Wake kind of really reminds me of that a lot and Twin Peaks had a show within

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.560
a show it was called like Ticket to Love or something like that was like the soap opera

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.720
within the show that would explain some of the things that are actually going on well

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:10.520
Alan Wake has something just like that Night Springs so I guess that show within a game

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.720
is getting a spinoff that's kind of neat I guess so they have a show within a show it

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:22.320
is not Alan Wake 2 it is not more download content for the first game so whatever this

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:29.160
is it is something new so that's pretty cool coming from Capcom we've talked about Monster

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:37.120
Hunter on the PS3 but now Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting is coming to the iOS systems Capcom

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.080
did announce it for June Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting it's coming out for the iOS devices

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.500
a new intuitive control system it will not use the typical d-pad hooray because I hate

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.800
d-pad translations on the iPhone because there is no d-pad on the iPhone so that'll be kind

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.080
of cool you can use horizontal slashes and vertical slashes kind of a whole different

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.040
little way of doing it probably more information to come at E3 so there you go

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:10.600
well how about some Rock Band news too there's some Lady Gaga Rob on this new download content

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:17.680
pack is going to be Lady Gaga pack 02 Born This Way Love Game and Paparazzi and there's

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:25.120
also a couple of excuse me I need to burp on the mic there also will be a pro guitar

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.760
upgrade for Alice in Chains Roosters and the White Stripes Dead Leaves in the Dirty Ground

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:39.000
and two individual songs that are by Foreigner Hot-Blooded and Urgent so those are in there

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.760
and then there is Super Street Fighter IV I just I always love an excuse to be able

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:57.080
to play Lady Gaga on the show come on Dark Soccer sing along let's hear the voice don't

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:05.320
be afraid of your voice Dark Soccer you were born this way baby later I'm not drunk yet

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:10.240
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition is going to be coming to Steam and they had some

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.840
issues with bringing it out for the PC but now it's going to be on Steam and it will

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.480
be 40 bucks there are pre-orders available too and there's not going to be though any

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:26.560
download content for Super Street Fighter Super Vanilla Street Fighter IV I should say

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.840
but the game will have a 10% discount on for the Super Arcade Edition bringing it down

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:41.680
to 36 bucks yay and the last of my batch of news is Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 has a release

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:49.000
date that's in Europe by the way it will be on July 1st so it's basically all the mobile

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.680
suits you have 50 playable and upgradeable characters 70 playable and upgradeable mecha

01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:00.960
or the mobile suits I should say including the mobile suit Gundam 00 and mobile suit

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:06.640
Gundam you see you also have three new gameplay systems that are partner strike emergency

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:16.040
dash and recovery gauge so there you go gundam gundam so I hate to bring it back to Lady

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:20.240
Gaga no you don't know this is an important question it's very important and I apologize

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.020
to the haters out there as well but this is actually related to technology did you see

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:28.320
the commercial for Google Chrome with her in it I don't watch TV Rob no well it's on

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.840
the internets it's all over YouTube I'll look on YouTube then yeah you should check it out

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.400
because Google Chrome does great commercials like and if you're not like a Lady Gaga fan

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.840
then go look at the one for the it gets better the commercial they did for like Dan Savage

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.060
and it gets better and how that whole movement was done on the internet like they've like

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:48.480
compressed the feeling of that movement into like a minute and it's just like I mean I

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.800
get a little verklempt it's it's great and then there's another Google Chrome commercial

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:57.520
for I love how you're totally using Yiddish now I know talk amongst yourselves amongst

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:04.440
yourselves I'll give you a topic Lady Gaga neither Gaga nor a lady if certain rumors

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:11.160
are to be believed that was great all right but yeah no like the and there's a Google

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:17.300
Chrome commercial for it's like a guy who and you keep seeing the search box fill in

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:23.400
with these different terms like how to speak French plane ticket to Paris and it's like

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.760
the whole thing is about like a long-distance relationship and how Google like helps them

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:35.080
like what is a truffle it's really adorable and like oh my god Google Chrome is a good

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:41.040
you know what I used it I upgraded to Firefox 4 and my personal opinion is that it's absolute

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.040
and utter fucking shit like it is slowed down my computer certain websites work to fire

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:52.800
Instagram Firefox 4 is shit Firefox 4 hasn't done anything Firefox 3 is fine I was a huge

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.320
Firefox fan and supporter up until version 4 which is crap I have switched to Chrome

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:02.280
I will now never look back because I I did Chrome in the very beginning and I was like

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.360
this is kind of crap but now Chrome is great see none of my stuff none of my stuff's been

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:11.600
worked with the upgrade I still use my fire FTP I use everything but anyway well by the

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:18.060
way since we did talk about Lady Gaga's involvement do you know that George Takei has a video

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:25.000
out now oh the it's okay to be Takei it's okay to be Takei well that whole law in what

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:36.640
is it wherever but fuck place it is haha lol not anymore it's it's stupid but if you haven't

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.080
heard of this oh no no the commercials great no and I love George Takei oh my god I want

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.740
him to be when I'm old I want to be like George Takei I've decided that I want him to be my

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:51.480
gay daddy for real me too he should be all of our gay daddies I know and then whenever

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:57.680
we don't you want George Takei as your gay daddy no and then when we do something and

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:03.840
then when we're naughty he goes oh my you've been naughty oh god him and Betty White I

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:11.640
know any comedy don't George Takei and Betty White need a buddy yes they do oh my god that

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.960
would be I would be their opening day but you know what you know what I thought was

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.000
really hot and I hate that it was for such a bad thing but I totally squeaked and had

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.200
a fangirl moment what when he was doing the the thing asking for donations for the the

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.560
flooding in Japan and he was speaking Japanese and I was like I love listening to Japanese

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.960
spoken in a really hot voice mm-hmm and I was just like be my daddy and he really does

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:42.140
have just like a sexy voice especially considering his age he always has had God he has a voice

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:49.160
that could melt like he has a voice that can you hear his voice and your panties come off

01:24:49.160 --> 01:25:00.080
right I'm getting a look I'm trying to think of what a super dense metal is it's hard to

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:06.960
melt because he could melt it he could make steam out of it anyway how do we get on this

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.120
subject oh yeah and that Kentucky law total bullshit come on but it's okay to be decay

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.120
I want the mug because a little Star Trek emblem on it all in rainbow I didn't even

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:22.400
see that I kind of it's my birthday's coming up just saying the website is it's okay to

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:28.520
be decay dot org or dot-com or something anyway we got on a tangent sorry about tangent rain

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.080
and look he's like I'm doing other stuff you know what though I am on to something with

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.640
the George Takei Betty White buddy comedy I mean I think a lot of our listeners would

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:41.160
see I mean it doesn't you know what I'm gonna go on Twitter right now and ask him would

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.600
you do a buddy comedy with Betty White you absolutely should I'm doing it because it's

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.640
it's you know it's okay to love George Takei cuz he was born this way whether gay straight

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:58.560
or bi lesbian transgender or I forget it don't forget about the asexual people to totally

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.080
miss my reference that's probably a good thing I know let's move on with the Twitter topics

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:12.000
for tonight twitter.com slash o l r tweet tweet tweet I'm actually being rude and I'm

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.760
like totally ignoring chat comments right now sorry chatters I was just I was really

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.360
into the whole George and Betty buddy comedy talk kaijuto in the chat room says George

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:26.720
and Betty should have a podcast absolutely they should let's see Tiger Claw says George

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.440
Takei may be best known for Star Trek but he made a contribution to Star Wars doing

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.020
a voice for an episode of the Clone Wars I didn't know that Bob Coffey says I wanted

01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:41.440
powers to be that be to make that Sulu Excelsior series happen it would have been win I love

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.760
the George Takei is like involved with the Star Trek fandom the way he is like he just

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:55.000
gets it he's just awesome all right moving on Twitter topics doo doo doo doo doo doo

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.560
let's go to the first Twitter topic tonight this is from and I'm horribly gonna mispronounce

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:05.540
this name and I apologize I'm in advance but it's Ramaditya Knight senses his first tweet

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:11.840
it's me playing Scars of Time with my flute and we're linked to a youtubey and this better

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.840
not be a rickroll all right it's not phew all right let's see let's uh let's play a

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.160
little clip of this I want to see one of our listeners playing Scars of Time on the flute

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:33.360
let me fast forward a little bit here not bad now this is not like a sideways flute

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:48.680
it's like a pan flute no he's playing on the tin whistle it's very authentic yeah I don't

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:54.080
know what the setup is for this video it looks like there's like he's in a classroom or something

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.720
because there's some lady holding the mic there and this camera person is making me

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.080
dizzy they just turned the thing sideways very good I love that theme oh god that's

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.400
a great video game song like if you don't know Scars of Time you need to pause this

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.940
podcast and go on to YouTube and either look at this guy's rendition or go just find the

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:26.480
original song like ASAP anyhow moving on to some other tweets here from sj100 Matt I heard

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.360
about this earlier in the week too let's see what you guys think of this you know what

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.160
sucks up the most internet bandwidth in the US sorry did you hear this story let me have

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:41.520
you guess what do you think takes up the most internet bandwidth of anything look yeah I'm

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.600
assuming you heard this one okay so dark soccer since she didn't read it with all of the hype

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:52.640
I would say illegal downloads that's a really good guess actually probably what about that

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.680
what legal thing do you think takes up the most bandwidth like if there's one particular

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:01.120
site is eating up more bandwidth than anybody else who do you think it is YouTube good both

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:07.320
good guesses but actually the most bandwidth in the US is Netflix on video game consoles

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:12.280
right now huh yeah and it makes sense because you know Facebook is mostly text and pictures

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.560
yeah whereas Netflix you know it's kind of a trick question Facebook's probably getting

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:20.440
the most hits I was thinking YouTube but Netflix is HD movies right yeah so yeah it's a little

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.640
bit of a trick question but yeah sj100 Matt links us to an article about the Netflix is

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:32.840
the top user of bandwidth on the internet nearly 20% of peak hour downstream traffic

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:38.800
in North America is used for streaming video over Netflix through a home video game console

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.560
representing the most usage of any source that's a testament to how fast this whole

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:48.080
technology in the game console stuff picked on and you know game consoles are selling

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.400
for the mere fact that you can use them as instant Netflix boxes don't don't lie to yourself

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:58.520
that this isn't a selling point for a lot of 360s and PlayStations and wheeze of excuse

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:04.240
me hiccups are killer and wheeze of the world you know Nintendo really had to get on with

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.400
Netflix with the whole Wii and I'm sure their next console will be on it as well so the

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:15.840
three game consoles that support Netflix the Wii Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 accounted for

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:21.400
the majority of that usage when combined consoles accounted for sixty six point three percent

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:29.480
of the figure or nineteen point seven percent of overall downstream usage that's crazy there

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:35.320
you go and no amiga it's not porn that is taking up the most bandwidth that's a really

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:41.540
good guess though let's see moving on to some other tweets DJ Rama S tweets us and says

01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:49.600
hey if you go to www.freeplayday.com you can get a free ten dollar play at Dave and Busters

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:54.760
boy I just I just did a total commercial for some website if that wasn't Rama S and I knew

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.680
he's like a legitimate person I would have thought that was you know what I've gotten

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:01.760
like five ten dollar off coupons from Dave and Busters just by being in their little

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:07.120
club thing so they they throw it out because they know you're gonna spend their money now

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.120
I'm gonna tell you my fucking bitch about Dave and Busters and this pisses me off pisses

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.520
me off I've been a member of Dave and Busters my little card there ever since I started

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.080
playing DDR and went to the Milpitas Great Mall for the first time literally ten years

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.640
ago literally ten years ago maybe nine was the first time I ever went to a Dave and Busters

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:29.860
and I've had the same card same card ever since then and it has given me problems when

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:33.800
I went to Times Square once I went to an OLR lunch with some of the OLR listeners like

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:38.400
Zaku Rama some people you've heard call into the show before went to lunch with them and

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.460
some others and they saw my card get borked by the system because I didn't roam it so

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:47.520
I had to get it saved and then it happened when I came back so long story short I've

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:51.520
used the same card for ten years now Dave and Busters has this program where once you

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:57.060
spend a certain amount of chips you go gold I went gold without ever having a Dave and

01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:01.840
Busters in Roseville finally just about like three months ago now the Dave Busters is in

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:08.480
Roseville so I go gold and what happens they discontinue the program one month later you

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.840
find this out on my birthday I found this out on Dark Soccer's birthday when I was like

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.160
oh can I get because my card once again borked because I used it at a different Dave and

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.360
Busters well they fix it so you know good on their customer service they always fix

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.760
the issue so fine you know I'm not mad at them for that I'm mad that they got rid of

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.280
the gold program because now it's like oh well we have this new thing now where you

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:34.000
get the coupons it's like I don't want to go on Wednesday night wah yeah this is serious

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.080
business that used to be mine and Dan's date night until I had classes on Wednesday no

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.320
I'll take Dan Dan and I can have date night at Dave and Busters but I don't have classes

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:45.680
on Wednesday night anymore okay so I have to get up at 8 30 in the freaking morning

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:51.280
on Monday and Wednesday to go to astronomy which I don't need astronomy but uh don't

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:57.760
get me started you don't want to go look at the planets I have no need for astronomy as

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:02.560
what's your major graphic design and I'll already have I have my to know how to draw

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:10.880
lines my degree will be here in like a few weeks I am officially a graduate uh I saw

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:16.920
a letter seven degrees saying sorry you need some astronomy all right let me go to a couple

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.680
tweets from Tiger Claw Tiger Claw is funny because uh he tweeted us a couple things I'm

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.000
like dude you tweeted us stuff that's gonna come up later in the show so he tweeted like

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.160
seven things but you only get two Tiger Claw but I'll read these these are the ones that

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.840
caught my eye harmonix is announcing a new game at e3 we'll file this between done of

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.600
course but I mean it's official harmonix is going to announce something new at e3 what

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.400
does go between done of course Dance Central 2 apparently is going to go between those

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.920
two uh I'm wondering if there is actually like something else with this as well they

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:56.480
have said it is not Rock Band 4 that is confirmed uh and apparently uh there was an interview

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:01.540
with Game Informer saying quote rest assured that harmonix is still developing new ideas

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:05.840
and concepts to advance the Rock Band franchise and we look forward to sharing them when the

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.760
time is right I don't think harmonix is all about Dance Central necessarily I think there'll

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:15.960
be something new from them I kind of hope it's a dj oh god I hope it's a dj game too

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:21.400
I I really I think they should be awesome if Konami refuses then you know what when

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.320
they fall asleep at the wheel as they always have with their series that could do great

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:32.960
here uh then you know what let harmonix do it better for real uh one other one I'm gonna

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:38.220
read here uh Ellie Noire we were talking about earlier in the show it is banned if you live

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:44.000
in the UAE so uh yep there it is United Arab Emirates uh the game magazine there the retail

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.440
I'm sorry the retail chain geekay geekay games I keep reading it as geeky games uh updated

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.660
their Facebook saying LA Noire has been banned yep the UAE the United Arab Emirates their

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.560
national media council they didn't say why they've banned the game but they've banned

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:06.280
it it probably has something to do with dead woman beaver I'm just taking a speculation

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:11.240
just guessing dead animals are nothing to you know dead animals are nothing to ban a

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:20.560
video game about is it Winona's brown beaver I don't think her name's Winona uh anyhow

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.120
maybe it is I don't know I haven't played LA Noire yet alright that does it for twitter

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:27.440
topics twitter.com slash olr if you want to send your shit early for next week let's move

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:36.160
on I just outed myself as a primus fan moving on Loki let's get into some other news yes

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:46.880
um so this is kind of I don't know typical of certain companies uh Zynga once again has

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:54.280
another lawsuit on their hands thanks to their game frontierville which has kind of borrowed

01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:02.080
like some ideas from certain games like Oregon Trail in fact on May 30th they they're planning

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:09.060
to launch the Oregon Trail expansion pack uh which basically allows you to go along

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:18.960
the Oregon Trail hunt um you know fording rivers etc um and of course the learning company

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.120
the people that hold the rights to the Oregon Trail they're none too happy about the fact

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:32.120
that Zynga's basically ripping off of their game and uh you know even calling it you know

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.840
the Oregon Trail expansion I mean granted yes the Oregon Trail is a real thing but it's

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:44.400
also very very very very similar to the Oregon Trail game usually I would go off on a tangent

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.660
right now about frivolous lawsuits etc etc but you know it's Zynga and I'm just kind

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:53.240
of like eh let him I watch the trailer and that damn thing is you know if not a really

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:58.880
lame version of the Oregon Trail that you would see on Facebook it is basically everything

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.280
that's part of the Oregon Trail yeah I realize the Oregon Trail is like a historic thing

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:08.560
but the other tricky thing about it is that Oregon Trail is actually on Facebook as a

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:16.800
game right now so uh Black Wolf in our chat room says unpopular opinion the actual trail

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.640
was called the Oregon Trail I doubt they have the rights to everything related to that historical

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.240
event uh no it's not as unpopular opinion it's true it's just I don't know like I just

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.880
I can't like there's so many other game companies that need to be advocated for that I don't

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:38.000
feel the need to save Zynga right now you know what I mean like sorry I want to look

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.880
at this trail or how'd it do hopefully I don't get sued because I said trail I want to look

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:48.080
at this trailer real fast here it's time to load up your connoisseur wagon and set off

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.120
on the whole down trail all you need is a few of your closest friends to join up as

01:37:53.120 --> 01:38:00.000
your crew you'll need a hunter to rustle up vittles and a carpenter for fixing the wagon

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.680
and such like and a doctor in case folks come down with the rocky mountain scoots you can

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:10.540
leave messages and fancy presents for your friends so they'll want to visit your expedition

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:15.120
every day okay I gotta be honest this really does look like the Facebook game the Oregon

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.560
Trail Facebook game like especially with the hunting thing and the whole fact how you invite

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:25.280
your friends to go on the trail with you like I I think um they have a point actually I

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:32.160
I really can't help Zynga on this one actually sorry I'm sorry seeing video of any Zynga

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:38.680
game being played makes me hate Facebook like I have hatred of Facebook you know thanks

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:44.300
to Zynga it's like invite your friends I fucking hate when people invite me to shit you know

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:52.020
what I do with people that invite me to shit I ignore it and perhaps block you from sending

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:59.560
me invites for shit I will not play Facebook games period except for the one time I played

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.300
Chuck Stucks to get the trick you guys would be impressed I didn't even play Gagaville

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:15.660
I didn't play it I'm sorry okay you know she here we go hold out revving the motor she's

01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:20.860
sold out I mean come on you're teaming up with you know Zynga for shit I don't give

01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:26.100
a shit if they donated money to you know some stupid you know to the tsunami stuff but they

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:32.020
donated it through you or you donate it through them big deal you know what I just think it's

01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:38.740
retarded that you're granted it's smart to market yourself as unicorns Rob I think I

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:43.620
know but I'm not gonna play it I am not gonna play it and look you hit the nail on the head

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:47.020
it was smart because it's going after the target audience and I don't mean to sound

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:53.460
like a sexist but it's a bunch of women playing Farmville and that's goo gaga a lot of Gaga's

01:39:53.460 --> 01:40:00.340
music appeals to most of most not all most of the Gaga haters are straight men like it's

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:06.560
just I did however fine don't get me wrong screen capture Madonna back in the day did

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.980
some really weird shit okay she was really weird she sold her soul to Pepsi and then

01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:16.500
they just they just fucked her over after that whole like a prayer thing but Gaga is

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:23.260
like you know Madonna to 11 it's just seriously she's fucking no she is she's actually more

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:27.540
more like Marilyn Manson than she is Madonna she's just fucking crazy and you know what

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:32.260
happened to Marilyn Manson people stop caring and that's what's gonna happen the Lady Gaga's

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:35.980
people are gonna stop fucking caring because you know what I gotta admit her I'll never

01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:42.660
stop I love her her early music was okay but each song comes out after that I care less

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:51.960
and less about like she starts making up stuff now yeah anybody can use spout out non words

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:58.460
you know in a song I mean that that's easy to do but it's just I don't get it like for

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:03.780
example born this way totally sounds like an anthem you know a gay anthem or something

01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:09.620
like that that she you know crafted on purpose so that it gets played in gay clubs make sure

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:14.660
that she has you know the gay demographic you know that's all it is it's seriously it's

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:22.540
just figuring out how to you know achieve you know the most listeners now I did find

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:27.440
actually one interesting marketing thing that she did where they were giving away a can

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.580
of monster fuel now I have to ask this since you talk about how like Gaga's music gets

01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:36.100
weirder and weirder and I really hope I don't get screwed by clicking on random YouTube

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:42.500
links but have you heard that Lady Gaga has a new song on her album called Shiza which

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:48.540
is German for shit so she literally has a song called shit on her new album let me play

01:41:48.540 --> 01:42:04.180
a little bit for you now that isn't weird at all except like it wait wait wait keep

01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:18.700
playing that for a second there it sounded like another Loki made me play Gaga you guys

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:24.860
he made me you know what whoever whoever did this thing should have used the the shit instead

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:30.860
of the instead of the B yeah no I was that's a yeah I'm serious if that picture right there

01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:35.740
doesn't make her look like a Satan blow-up doll I don't know what you know what to say

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:41.460
I mean she was like she was on American Idol the other week as a mentor which is just like

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:47.500
okay whatever you mad no I'm not mad I'm just like I just rolled my eyes it's like she's

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:54.140
like okay oh it's my time on camera I'm gonna say something crazy crazy and it's like you

01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:00.900
know there's okay that wasn't really helpful at all but thanks you know I don't know what

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:05.380
the hell she was wearing but it was something retarded it's like I'm not gonna stand for

01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:13.180
such Gaga hating on this program roll she's a genius oh she's a saint please she a genius

01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:18.660

a fucking mistake revoke his Mensa membership immediately no seriously she's not a fucking

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:41.540
genius she's good at marketing okay you know what there are people that are in the magazine

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:46.940
business that are good at marketing Steve Jobs is good at marketing but he's not fucking

well okay he is fucking crazy but he's not fucking quick overtly fucking crazy you know

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:57.820

week shares eligible for Medicare feeling old she she'll go away I don't even care

01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:19.420
SSU 100 man chat says fact there will be a Gaga video game sometime in her lifetime God

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:27.380
I know I got there already is I mean this is Gaga Ville I guess anyway and we've all

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:32.740
seen her couch all right it looks like she wearing it on her face because I swear to

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:38.860
God you know sometimes I wonder that she's just relocated her vagina to her face I mean

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:43.540
it would get from the fucking Oregon Trail the Lady Gaga's vagina on her face that's

01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:48.780
what I want Zinga there you go I bet you anything that's going to be the next album cover is

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:55.820
her with a vajay face it will be her coming out of her own vagina that'll be the Elmar

01:44:55.820 --> 01:45:00.340
right there she'll be coming out of her own vagina she's like I'll be born actually you

01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:04.220
need to see last night's I swear this will be the end of it guys you need to see last

01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:07.300
night's Saturday Night Live performance because she was on Saturday Night Live and she did

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:12.740
Born This Way her song and what she did during the performance she actually got pregnant

01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:18.980
and gave birth live on stage to a bunch of glitter during the performance it was an art

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:25.220
piece and it was brilliant it was brilliant I was moved if that's an art by the way and

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:29.880
when this is the last of the Gaga for me you know what she did to everybody who's coming

01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:36.180
out in line she bought them dinner and donuts and coffee and signed autographs and took

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:41.580
pictures with people waiting in line yeah because she genuinely likes her fans well

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:45.900
I'm glad that she genuinely likes her fans but you know what I'm sorry that still doesn't

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:52.340
make you a fucking whore and you know and if you if you call what that she did on stage

01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:57.140
art then I'm sorry a peep show is fucking art then and you know what there's more peep

01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:01.700
shows out there than there are Gaga so I guess we have that to be thankful I don't I don't

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:05.780
hate on peep shows that's one thing you'll never hear me ranting about on this program

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:12.160
Loki I would never touch your sacred pornography collection I would never there's nothing sacred

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:21.260
about that all right whatever I'm done can we get back to video games let's all right

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:25.700
this is very important look we need to go from Lady Gaga talking about very important

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:35.540
video game news such as this cat food maker friskies has released I point iPad and Android

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:45.780
games for your cat this is why we have to talk about tasty treasures party mix-up and

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:53.780
catfishing iPad games for your cat an iPad pussy play with you okay you know I watched

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:59.060
a little video and it is super adorable I would get this for Shermy if I had an iPad

01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:07.860
and she didn't have pause oh my god this looks so cute your little pet can touch the food

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:14.460
and it splits up that actually is really cute there's the fishy one is great that's tasty

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:20.820
treasures on here all it is is random shit flying on the screen and the cat just goes

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:25.780
meow meow meow meow meow it's like like it's playing whack-a-mole and they they they burst

01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:34.380
this is it catfishing which is like the little koi app on the iPhone now salacious pop my

01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:39.260
significant other in chat room says I am NOT buying maruko our cat an iPad fuck that and

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.820
to that I'm saying no no no you're not buying maruko an iPad you're buying me an iPad and

01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:50.660
maybe I'll let your cat play with it my birthday is June 26 just saying it's okay I'm getting

01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:56.740
you a TK mug no but all seriousness what do you think I mean there's a lot to laugh at

01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:00.920
here when you're talking about kitties playing games on the iPad but at the same time it's

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.480
oddly fucking fascinating that like we are now to the point where we're making video

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:12.300
games for the cats they're free right um I would hope so because they're kind of commercial

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:18.760
games let's see the games do keep score and your cats can compete to see you as the best

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:23.700
reaction don't give a shit boy oh boy my cat gives a shit all over the floor actually I'm

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:30.700
not sure if they're free or not I can't see they can't they can't be more than a dollar

01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:35.260
I'm sure they're not more than they're probably free because given the simplicity of the games

01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:40.220
are probably free see look sure me is not sleeping anymore she's looking up and listening

01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:45.100
that's right sure means like fuck yeah mommy I want that well mommy wants an iPad baby

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:49.780
so you have to wait tell daddy that she only wants an iPad so she can shit on it that's

01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:54.380
what your cat will do no your cat will be like what's this game sure me do you just

01:48:54.380 --> 01:49:01.220
want to shit on everything if I could show you a picture sometimes this is terrible radio

01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:05.260
but the cat is like smelling the microphone going what is this it smells like mommy it

01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.580
smells like mommy's spaghetti because mommy had spaghetti tiger claw in our chat room

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:18.380
asks how long till they make games for dogs or ferrets um Byron D0 said something even

01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:22.940
funnier what's that Rorschach and Deadpool because they played the same music that they

01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:31.420
played in part of that slashes pop in our chat room says this is a game for people who

01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:37.340
make their cats real Facebook pages and then comment with meow meow on their IRL profile

01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:42.620
with coworkers and shit on them oh my god those are the people that creep me the crap

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:49.620
out on Facebook when they do that for their pets and their babies your baby can't speak

01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:55.420
and if your baby can speak it's not anything intelligible by most people your baby doesn't

01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:58.900
need a Facebook your cat doesn't need a Facebook your dog doesn't need a Facebook your children

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:03.660
probably even if they're up to seven years old don't need a Facebook maybe the baby hit

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:09.980
random buttons and autocorrect things everything he's got a point you know what these iPad

01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:13.300
games I bet would be really good for babies to have proven though that a two-year-old

01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:17.780
can operate an iPhone oh I'm sure text and make calls I brought you know what not to

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:21.300
make myself sound like you or whatever I probably could have when I was younger I had a Commodore

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:26.620
64 when I was five and I knew what I was doing with it I mean for the most part I was typing

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:30.080
up stuff from the back of the book like that was me programming was typing programs in

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:36.860
from the back of the book but you know right anyhow let's move on with some more stories

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:41.820
enough about kitty iPad games let's talk about one of dark soccer favorite games dark

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:49.500
soccer well I'm actually still on the German alphabet website portal portal to offended

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:57.740
people and you know who the people who defended the adopted because of all the cracks that

01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:02.900
glad us makes the game about the character being adopted and of course I like it in the

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:08.940
end when Wheatley's doing goes fatty adopted fatty it's like like you are adopted and that's

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:18.740
terrible but yeah is basically this dude named Neil's staple was playing portal to and he's

01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:29.660
adopted father to Zoe a Chinese orphan and got pissed off when the when glad us was going

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:38.360
off on cell for being adopted of course also overweight people and idiots are offended

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:45.860
to because they also talk about all that and probably trash is insulted and probably turrets

01:51:45.860 --> 01:52:00.180
so yeah it's it's the the the adopter who was insulted not the adoptee again oh wait

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:05.460
we have local news story on this that we can play oh my god I love these I love when local

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:09.880
news media like completely misrepresent video games is gonna be amazing okay I'm gonna play

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:27.460
this ready and if we're lucky maybe somehow Loki can turn this into Lady Gaga chat actually

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:31.740
the quality of this is rather shit and it's really quiet so I don't know if I should really

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:37.400
play the whole thing because it's not really coming through so maybe I won't do that well

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:42.300
let me see if I can crank it up some other way hold on one sec guys live radio is tons

01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:47.660
of fun no I have wave up as high as they'll go it's I can't get that any louder what a

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:54.500
shit little play some of it no it's too quiet they can't hear it let me um let me go to

01:52:54.500 --> 01:53:04.020
YouTube see if I can find it real quick uh WBTV portal to find portal to being adopted

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:09.180
yeah I'm gonna see if this works better administration we have discovered a popular video game making

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:15.860
fun of adoption and tonight a father is shocked at the insensitivity he says he witnessed

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:26.180
here's the clip what's wrong with being adopted that's not well um lack of parents the game

01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:30.740
is called portal 2 and it's only been available for about a month we get him back just to

01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:35.460
talk to the father who's shared this who saw this with his daughter yeah I bet he was shocked

01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:40.020
and really surprised by something like yeah no idea particularly because this is a game

01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:45.220
that builds itself as educational it's rated e for everyone as we said neil staple was

01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:49.860
playing the game with his 10 year old adopted daughter when they saw the clip tonight he

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:55.500
says he and his wife are still searching for a way to try to explain it I didn't know what

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:59.820
to do I still don't know what to do neil staples still can't believe what he heard while playing

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:10.500
the video game portal 2 with his 10 year old adopted daughter Zoe they really do make this

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.360
look pretty terrible I got to admit but like I feel like this like really taken out of

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:20.060
context you know it is it's like you have to remember they're taunting they're taunting

01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:24.420
everything about her you know no matter what it is and to be honest I don't think they

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:29.180
ever really proved that she's adopted no so I don't know like I just kind of feel like

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:33.540
this is really selective hearing that's that's my biggest issue what's going on here but

01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:39.240
like I watch this news report and I go wow this game's fucking rude but I've played through

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:45.300
the game and I didn't get that impression at all it is it's e 10 plus it's not a baseline

01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:51.320
e for everyone oh so in other words the 10 year old daughter since she's not 10 plus

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:56.540
she's 10 probably should have been watching well it's 10 and over it's not over 10 god

01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:00.420
damn you low you always got to fucking disagree with me did you hear that the character in

01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:07.860
the popular kids video game is actually taunted for being adopted it literally pokes fun for

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:12.100
not having parents wow and you literally proved that you're an idiot have never hidden the

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:17.440
fact Zoe is adopted she's Chinese she obviously doesn't look like us they wanted to wait until

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.980
she was ready to talk about it froze the question the most ultimate question that that child

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:30.660
is ever going to have for you and it just throws her right in the living room I needed

01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:36.740
really gonna cry I really needed attention um that's why I contacted the news because

01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:42.460
I needed attention because I'm an idiot hold on but he heard immediately cut the game off

01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:48.540
hoping Zoe hadn't heard the cruel joke from a video game build is educational and appropriate

01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:54.300
for everyone 10 and up and it says rated e for everybody and I was thinking maybe it's

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.700
rated e for everybody except for orphans if you're not an adoptive parent it's probably

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:04.100
not that big a deal to you if you are an adoptive parent it was literally the worst thing I

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:09.300
could possibly have heard but did Zoe hear it she's sticking to her guns that she didn't

01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.100
hear it and to me that message means she's not ready to talk about it and I'm not gonna

01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:20.500
force it oh my god eyes rolling too much Neil says they steer clear of that part of the

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:26.180
game and hope their daughter never feels like she's any less because she's adopted I can't

01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:33.300
imagine my life without her I mean she's just such an awesome child she's just made our

01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.320
lives so much better okay now again we did say this game was now surely there'll be a

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.540
counterpoint to this right like surely they tried to reach out to valve for comment right

01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:46.100
hey you know and it's because you have to sort of figure out a way to get out of every

01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:52.060
single room we did contact Sony who distributes the game they told us to contact valve the

01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:56.900
company that actually created the game I did we have not heard back from them passing the

01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:03.660
buck onto somebody certainly seems oh oh that is so not the way it works Sony doesn't distribute

01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:08.980
the game it's EA that distributes the game idiot god you're funny send me the link to

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:14.140
that place because I'm going to type one hell of a rebuttal well you know what since they

01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:21.820
didn't respond back to our claim they're wrong having interned in local news as long as I

01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:28.020
did I mean I know this means a lot but by trying to contact them they probably gave

01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:33.300
a couple hours tops this was all done within a day most disabled comments most stories

01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:37.260
you do are done or most stories you see on the news are done in a day unless it's like

01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:41.460
for sweeps or something it's it's all done start to finish in a day so valve didn't get

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:47.020
back to this lady within the same day it didn't make the news and it's not going to so I think

01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:51.500
it's kind of screwed up that they didn't really show both sides of it but I got to admit I

01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:58.220
will I mean you might unpopular opinion okay everybody that piece and I agree portal looks

01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:06.300
pretty fucked up the website is WB TV dot-com email them all email them please email them

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:11.260
I think honestly the part that they kind of leave out that kind of irritates me is that

01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:14.100
if you're going to play that game with your kid you kind of have to be able to explain

01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:20.060
it all to them and you have to explain that these characters will mock anything to try

01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:24.540
that's what glad us does she mocks everything what's next is somebody going to be upset

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:31.500
because the game called them fat I don't know it's just a little silly and it's a character

01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:37.940
it's a narrative it's not hey you person playing the game you adopted well you're stupid you're

01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:46.300
adopted your parents loser adopted loser and you're fat parents would have had abortion

01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:50.940
but they couldn't so they had you and gave you away you really sound a lot worse than

01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:57.900
it treated you for for a burger burgers are more desirable than you fatty prey eat tons

01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:08.700
of burgers can we move on new story please well I actually am going to email them well

01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:19.220
that was my story so bogey I yes so when I'm not complaining about that kind of stuff Ubisoft

01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:24.780
you know they're looking at maybe taking the next step with some of their franchises instead

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:30.060
of leaving in the hands of people that may not be able to do their franchise as well

01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:35.940
in the motion picture world they're going to go ahead and form Ubisoft motion pictures

01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:40.780
they're going to adapt some of their biggest properties Assassin's Creed Splinter Cell

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:48.540
and Ghost Recon into 3d features I'm very disappointed though that rabbits were not

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:52.980
part of that because honestly I think that would work much better as a 3d animated feature

01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:59.660
than you know some of this stuff but whatever they said in addition to the trio of future

01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:05.100
projects the studio is reportedly developing 3d CGI animated series oh they are based on

02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:13.140
the rabbit's properties awesome so the comprised of 78 episodes seven minutes apiece it's almost

02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:19.020
like their little trailers that they have that's awesome but seriously though they should

02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:24.540
they should get their own full-length theater or a theatrical movie couldn't be any worse

02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:31.480
than some of the other stuff I've seen yeah all right let's see one other actually two

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:35.820
other quick e3 related stories hello Konami and I think this is brought up earlier in

02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:39.100
the show but let's just throw it out there they are going to be doing their e3 press

02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:43.340
conference a little bit early this year they're going to be doing their press conference I

02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:57.980
believe it is the Sunday beforehand let's see it is on pre e3 show 2011 and it is happening

02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:03.060
is there really a press release that doesn't have the fucking time of the event in here

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:07.460
Konami today announced the venue picks for the company's first animal annual global pre

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:16.500
e3 e3 show 2011 at the Times listed below and they never say what day it is I'm pretty

02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:20.280
sure it's Sunday but that's amazing that the press release doesn't actually say what day

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:25.020
it is oh no there it is the live events taking place June 2nd thank you who it said once

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:31.720
all right so June 2nd that is a Thursday Thursday oh that's really early all right so they're

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:36.180
going to be doing their press conference on the Thursday beforehand give bloggers and

02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:40.420
people will chance talk about it and you can attend live if you want they're going to actually

02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:47.620
be renting places in Los Angeles San Francisco Toronto Sao Paulo Mexico City so they're getting

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:51.980
international with this see now my only thing about this though is they said it's like live

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.340
viewing parties now they just watching the press conference are they actually going to

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:59.420
be able to play games there and stuff I don't know they they aren't really saying it makes

02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:05.020
it sound like they're just going to be able to watch like you'll just get to be able to

02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:11.760
watch this and you can register online for a chance to attend with the place here in

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:15.220
San Francisco they're going to be doing at his temple nightclub I'm not familiar with

02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:19.140
that place but I imagine it's at four o'clock it's kind of early but they probably have

02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:23.540
to pick a time like that because four o'clock would be seven o'clock on the East Coast and

02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:30.180
what time would that be in Japan it would be 8 a.m. the next day I think so maybe that's

02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:35.460
why they're doing it at that time I don't know but yeah they're doing a pre-3 show 2011

02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:39.500
and talking about these venues they picked so facebook.com slash Konami if you want to

02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:47.340
go to the viewing event or you can just watch it online interesting anyhow Microsoft's E3

02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:53.220
briefing will be very easy to watch you can just turn on Spike TV and it'll be on Spike

02:02:53.220 --> 02:03:00.180
TV is announced they will air an Xbox 360 centric show 1230 p.m. Pacific time Monday

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:05.700
June 6th no it's weird is normally that is reserved for g4 yeah it is a little weird

02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:11.900
because g4 don't they have the exclusive e3 like pass or whatever usually they do for

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:17.180
um I know they've done um Microsoft's conference in the past technically though the press conferences

02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:24.860
are a part of e3 so that's why yeah I probably pay money for it so interesting so everybody's

02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:28.340
gonna be able to watch that live as long as you have basic cable otherwise I'm sure it'll

02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:35.500
be streamed over Justin TV everywhere so check that out all right let with that let's go

first and find some emails to read for us today first email greetings olr is your friendly

02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:55.420
neighborhood turtle I have no game related comments or questions this week I just wanted

02:03:55.420 --> 02:04:00.360
to send hearts your way and say that olr is the best and only gaming podcast that I currently

02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:05.100
listen to and whoever is responsible for putting the podcast up on the internet says doing

02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:09.940
an awesome job Oh Rob thank you because every Monday I wake up for work and see that your

02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:15.440
show is available for download it makes my Mondays so much better thank you all so much

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.900
for all the time and effort you put into the show each week your loyal turtle in Philly

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:22.840
serious turtle I literally don't allow myself to do anything else Sunday nights until the

02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:27.780
show is posted plus the other thing that made it a lot easier I changed the way I write

02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:32.300
descriptions so I don't actually have to think of a sassy like commentary on what happened

02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:35.460
during the show I just basically post like the first five stories from the show roll

02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:40.700
and then that's it cuz I who's reading the descriptions like not our subscribers I don't

02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:44.520
think they really read the description I mean I could be wrong but I just in the interest

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:50.020
of getting it up faster I just and we don't edit the show either I mean I have to edit

02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:54.700
it to take out the middle part where we play copyright music and just clean up the beginning

02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:58.240
and end but as for like the actual content in the middle it's live radio we don't really

02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:04.220
edit like something has to go really really wrong or somebody has to say something really

02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:09.580
really bad for us to edit and I don't remember I ease I haven't edited any content out and

02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:17.160
easily a year at least so well I guess this doesn't really apply to you anymore Rob since

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:23.180
I know you've got the trial but Holly D sent an invite and said any of us can use it to

02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:29.900
play rift oh she's been pimping out on a horde house on the forums over there she's desperate

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:36.860
to get her corgi and the other little rewards that she can get so well that's there maybe

02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:42.980
maybe I'll look at it but I really can't I have no time were you liking rift I'm gonna

02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:49.600
plead the fifth until later all right anyway we gotta say without a without a doubt though

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:57.260
that it is better than Final Fantasy 14 absolutely okay I was still in writing my angry email

02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:02.420
to WBTV sorry anyway then we have another one from Holly hi all I was listening to your

02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:06.340
latest podcast about tons of people turning in their ps3s you guys said multiple times

02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:10.060
that you thought it was fickle personally I think it's about people making a statement

02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:13.500
to the company that this sort of thing is not acceptable it's not that they don't want

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:18.060
to play the games it's not that they were hacked it says Sony was adequately protected

02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:22.160
inadequately protected their information new in advance of the protection it was inadequate

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.020
taunted hackers got hacked and then covered it up for three weeks that's not a company

02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:31.440
I want to give my money to that's but you gotta admit there's a ton of people doing

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:35.980
it out of being purely fickle there's a lot of people there's just that's how people are

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:42.100
I can understand it for every you know one person who's got true authentic integrity

02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:49.660
and turning it in there's gonna be 25 other that are gonna just be telling me seriously

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:54.280
I mean okay to continue I mean it's all can I say this real quick though you're you're

02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:59.580
only following the here's where the line is between fickle and yeah I meant it is when

02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:05.220
a game like The Last Guardian comes out are you gonna rebuy a ps3 if you sold yours back

02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:09.580
you know is there gonna be like if you mean it and you stick to your guns then you know

02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:13.700
what you have every right it's your money you should let you spend it on what you want

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:18.380
we only think your fickle when it's you know I'm selling it back but I'm just gonna buy

02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:22.900
one again three months later when I forget that it happened because there's a game that's

02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:30.540
out that I really want but some people never forget it's understandable to continue yes

02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:34.080
I mean it's good that only credit cards are stolen that people finally know but the way

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:38.180
Sony waited to tell everyone to cancel their cards is just unacceptable I really think

02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:42.660
that people dumping their ps3 is really then telling the company that this crosses a line

02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:47.000
people who dump a console or a game over principle they hold dear are really not being fickle

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.420
they just feel the statement they need to make is more important I stopped playing well

02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.260
because of something Blizzard did that I find unacceptable it doesn't matter that I like

02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:57.980
the game I'm not going to put money into a company that treats its customers badly and

02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:03.060
I really feel this is why people are abandoning ship on Sony holiday like I said I think that

02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:09.760
for every one person that's got a legitimate reason with actual integrity behind it the

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:16.220
rest of them are shaping you know and I would fully admit there's been times I really would

02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:20.180
want to leave Blizzard but I kind of feel like I'd be being one of those fickle people

02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:23.780
like I just go right back six months later when that patch comes out that I really want

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:30.020
to play so I don't know it's tough when you stick to your guns that's pretty admirable

02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:35.340
yeah it's kind of like being vegetarian or vegan no don't let's go further people who

02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:40.920
actually like stay vegan for years and years is Gaga vegan no I don't I don't know if she

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:46.140
no she wore a dress made out of meat so she wore meat doesn't mean she eats meat I don't

02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:54.300
think people who are vegan either do it for severe health reasons or for animals and no

02:08:54.300 --> 02:09:00.380
I'm not don't hear me wrong I'm not knocking vegans but there are some people who like

02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:03.540
do it for a couple weeks and they're like this is too hard I gotta go back to eating

02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:11.580
chicken you know so I don't know I think I personally I've tried to go vegetarian I can't

02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:17.140
do it I can't even go vegetarian it's too hard I didn't get enough protein I know how

02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:21.260
to get protein I just still wasn't getting enough of it anyway I don't know when I just

02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:27.300
started comparing like Blizzard of being a vegetarian but okay next email hello guys

02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:31.220
first of all congratulations on your awesome show I listen to it at work and it makes my

02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:36.220
hours go by faster I would like your opinion on these two topics one games with poor and

02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:42.900
are no control configuration options yeah that sucks and games that don't allow you

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:49.100
to pause the cutscenes thank you and good luck with your show and that's from I'll just

02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:58.720
say kds I wish the emailer had given us some specific examples of games like I know there

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.660
are games like that that don't have the customer and I know I've gone on this tangent on the

02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:09.460
show before like games that have the really whack controls that you just can't re-customize

02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:12.900
and yet now I'm drawing a total blank like I can't remember any of them I'm sure a chat

02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:18.140
room will help us out here this is why I love having a live chat but yeah and then cutscenes

02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:24.140
yeah that's kind of annoying or unskippable ones too like Mortal Kombat story mode it's

02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:31.980
pretty cool and you can pause cutscenes but you can't skip them and unless it's your second

02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:35.580
time playing through which I think is really weird because what I don't like is that in

02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:42.020
Mortal Kombat if you are stuck on a certain part you have to keep watching the cutscene

02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:48.980
leading up to it over and over until you beat it if you turn off the game because if you

02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:52.060
just hit retry you don't have to watch the whole thing over and over but like sometimes

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:55.740
I get so frustrated I need to walk away for a little bit and then come back and the last

02:10:55.740 --> 02:11:00.240
thing I want to do when I come back is watch the cutscene again so yeah by the way Xena

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.960
Core says no vegan diet no vegan powers I loved that whole scene oh that's from Scott

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:13.980
Pilgrim huh yeah I see what you did there okay um moving forward um hi Ola Crew this

02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:21.900
is Ramadita I guess that's how I hope I pronounced it right a blind gamer from Indonesia I sent

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:25.920
you some emails a long time ago and this email will be absolutely be the sign that I'm still

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:30.140
following you until now great show as always although I cannot contribute my thoughts like

02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:33.700
the other listeners because I cannot play games like others do I hope I can still be

02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:38.220
part of all our discussion with my personal thought about video games I consider myself

02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:41.780
as one of the veteran gamers because when I was a child video games were so easy to

02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:44.820
be played even without my site sorry can I interrupt for real quick what was the name

02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:50.780
of the email again rum rum Ramadita is that the same person that sent the scars of time

02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:58.280
flute thing I think it is okay so okay like don't invalidate your opinion just because

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:03.760
you have like a challenge because you know in watching what you did with the scars of

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:08.740
time thing clearly you have a love and passion for video games so that makes you just as

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.020
much of a gamer as anybody else with just as much a right to your opinion as anyone

02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:16.260
else just just throwing that out there okay I consider myself as one of the veteran gamers

02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:20.140
because when I was a child video games are so easy to be played even without my site

02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:24.540
my brother and friends helped me anyway that's why I know about classic games a lot and the

02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:28.160
classic game of the week by dark Sakura is enjoyable for me besides Loki's funny mockery

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:34.980
of course so I would like to share the enjoyment I've gotten several months ago it was when

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:40.420
I found a angry video game nerd I love angry video game nerd and imported the DVDs from

02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:45.340
the author I don't know if any one of you ever heard about a VGN it's a series of classic

02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:49.580
video games featuring James as a nerd that plays old video games actually he reviewed

02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:55.460
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the like the DVD sets recently and it was hilarious but

02:12:55.460 --> 02:13:01.100
my favorite that he does is the Friday the 13th review so funny anyway okay he reviews

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:06.900
the negative sides of of games of badass style you'll see in here a lot of fucks and shits

02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:13.980
in there beer included just google it or go to Wikipedia for more information and he linked

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:23.300
a video I want to share you should actually if you can I think a lot of people have seen

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:28.780
it I gotta admit I don't get get the big deal I think it's hilarious I want to share it

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:32.420
because the show is very enjoyable for me even without my ability to see what's happening

02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:37.780
on screen I don't know what will happen to me if I am not blind and able to watch those

02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:42.460
I believe you all can find some amusement there too now on to me like I said that I

02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:46.980
am blind so I cannot play video games the same like others but I do and do enjoy online

02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:51.100
games text-based and right now I'm playing blade of eternity and the link is blade of

02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:57.380
eternity calm and reach level 148 besides I do enjoy video game music and I love playing

02:13:57.380 --> 02:14:02.780
some of them using my flute just go to my youtube channel is the same guy yeah it's

02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:09.580
a rip I'm gonna spell it out r-a-m-a-d-i-t-y-a Skywalker and watch my favorite is when I

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:13.740
played scars of time from chrono cross yep well that's all for me I hope this email can

02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:17.220
be read and I will get more friends to talk about video games I only have a few local

02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:21.900
friends that understand English and stuff like stuff I like anyway cheers from and I

02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:27.140
hope I'm pronouncing it right r-a-m-a-d-i-t-y-a I think that's for muddy jazz I said it too

02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:33.820
yeah very cool that's all that's very sweet I love the angry video game there to rush

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:40.220
it up hater there's a whole nother layer but I'm not gonna get into it that's all I'm gonna

02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:46.420
say okay and it actually has nothing to do with that show specifically and I know that

02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:52.540
makes no sense at all it's the dude no no no no no no no no just I'll tell you another

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:23.780
Holly and then the last one that by the way I did hear about that and man somebody needs

02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:29.380
to catch these hackers like at some point these hackers are gonna get too bold and let

02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:33.500
me warn you because this might not be the same person that's doing the Sony folder can

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:40.940
you get well I know right but the problem is one of these days hacker you're gonna get

02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:46.780
sloppy and you're gonna get caught and it doesn't matter which video game website you

02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:52.260

you don't believe me go watch go rewatch that zany local news report about portal to to

02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:04.580
watch the way that the media will construe things to get a story even if you say whatever

02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:08.500
they want exactly even if you had nothing to do with the Sony hack if you get caught

02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:17.220

02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:31.740
Loki how about you yes apparently the Fox Entertainment Group has an FCC filing that

02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:40.900
points to possibly a new video service coming to consoles and they're saying that Fox Entertainment

02:17:40.900 --> 02:17:47.060
Group and its multi-channel video program distribution partners have shown intent that

02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:51.540
they're planning on broadening their platforms that they offer content on and that it will

02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:56.660
see subscription and on-demand video services available directly to wide-marketed consumer

02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:04.140
electronics devices such as game consoles sometime in the near future so maybe something

02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:09.260
that will be announced later on maybe something that's uh you know time like a capable provider

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:17.900
or something like that um let's see hmm do we don't we have enough video services on

02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:22.700
consoles at this point though there's a lot between Netflix and Hulu although Hulu Plus

02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:28.260
kind of sucks because of their ads you know you know you know I'm not a fan of ads and

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:35.660
paying for it it's one or the other not both anyhow one other story for you guys tonight

02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:40.660
and then we're gonna get into the skype line whoopee 1877 game oil or actually I lie we're

02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:45.700
gonna get into the FUs of the week and then the skype line 1877 game olr but first let

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:51.220
me read this quick story about Kid Icarus Uprising which of course is the 3ds Kid Icarus

02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:55.780
game that's coming out soon maybe they'll announce the date for this at e3 I don't know

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:59.920
but there is a Japanese website out there for the game Kid Icarus Uprising it pretty

02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.180
much recycles trailers that you've already seen but probably when we get to e3 you'll

02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:08.220
see a lot more I imagine this game will be playable on the show floor at e3 so you're

02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:12.540
gonna see a lot of content from it now some other stuff that's coming out of this though

02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:19.700
is that Nintendo is going to be using fan me's on a float that will show up at the go

02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:29.100
show gawara tachi neputa festival that happens in August me's will be joining pit and patina

02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:34.300
and there's a whole page in Japanese on how you can create a me on your 3ds save it and

02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:40.940
send it into Nintendo which I imagine it needs to be a g-rated me and not one of the ones

02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:49.500
where you funny looking things yeah or celebrities but uh what's to stop Nintendo from just doing

02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:54.220
random looking me is like nobody's gonna know the difference nobody knows what me is truly

02:19:54.220 --> 02:20:00.140
a person or not s 200 mat in our chat room says goat say me needs to be on that float

02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:07.100

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:12.660
parade woohoo all right uh let's get into the fus of the week before I forget every

02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:14.420
week on this show we do a little bit of ranting

02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:40.460
fuck you to wbtv for being highly unprofessional I'm sorry you presented yourself as immature

02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:45.380
unprofessional and clearly biased you're a hack you're a hack organization and that's

02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:52.060
our opinion and so I'm writing an email looking fuck you to my new portable hard drive that's

02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:58.220
USB powered for deleting said data on portable hard drive when I didn't want to I was like

02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:04.580
why is this not working and then I looked on it oh it's empty thanks you know that's

02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:10.360
never done that to me yeah I think I blame partly my 360 and I had to create a 360 data

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:14.700
partition in it well not really a data partition but usually they'll do it without erasing

02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:21.940
data but it decided and I went where you use mine and mine was fine yeah but my 360 is

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:25.700
being retarded and didn't want to see the drive until I did that now finally sees the

02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:33.220
drive so oh too bad yeah I'm sorry my fu of the week goes to Loki because he doesn't like

02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:41.340
Lady Gaga she's brilliant he's a hater if that's my fu of the week then that means things

02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:45.460
are going pretty good how about if you f you to headaches because I had a bad one yesterday

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:14.300
about the store um somehow with my paypal account instead of putting the right address

02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:19.780
which was on there they somehow got my old address when um this was before I moved and

02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:24.220
before I got changed I didn't realize it so I realized it the night after the order was

02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:30.860
placed I called in but unfortunately the package had already shipped so they had to wait for

02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:36.300
it to try to be delivered and then they can cancel so they whoever it was at the door

02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:39.900
thank god there was nobody there living there in my old apartment at the time so it got

02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:46.820
sent back to them but they were they not only replaced the old package with a new one but

02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:52.380
they also refunded the money to my account which I thought was a little odd but hey it

02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:57.340
was you know so I technically got the item for free but um the guy who walked me through

02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:02.580
and tried to help me as much as he could not only did TA do it through the phone in a very

02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:09.420
positive and nice fashion but also kept up with accordingly like almost every few hours

02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:13.540
by email which was very nice and I mean he did flood the mailbox like every three to

02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:17.720
four hours it's like one email in the morning one email in the evening saying here's what

02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:22.700
we got here's what we're gonna do here's what the game so constant communication yes

02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:26.900
and that is that is a very important part of customer service you know um I don't talk

02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:30.760
a lot about my day job here on Orange Lawn Tradio because I really want to keep my two

02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:34.040
lives separated I do not want the line being blurred between what I do during the night

02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:38.500
what I do during the day because I you know it's just it's not it's not okay for the

02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:43.260
two lines to be crossed however I trained for nine years in customer service I trained

02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:47.780
for a large large call center here in the area on customer service and I'll tell you

02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:52.000
one of the things that we were really big on was making sure that you know information

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.100
was always communicated the customer communication is so key I think because people don't call

02:24:56.100 --> 02:25:01.540
into places or email or whatever to hear I don't know or you know there's nothing we

02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:05.640
can do about that they want it resolution that's why you pick up the phone and call

02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:10.180
somebody in the first place so yeah and it was it was really cool because he's like yes

02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:14.980
sir no sir and he had a very positive attitude it's like it's like almost that he was like

02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:18.620
talking to my good talk to like a best friend or a good friend about something he's like

02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:23.480
yeah you know hey it happens you know no problem when you look into it hey listen I got a place

02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:27.640
to hold um I promise I'll be right back and if I don't I got your information right here

02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.380
I'll call you right back and we'll walk we'll try to see what we can do and it was very

02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:36.760
nice and a lot of companies most times when you call it's kind of like I don't care I'm

02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:43.100
just going to do it's more robotic and you know it's like why did I do this in the first

02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.700
place when I just can do this through email and just probably get the same response so

02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:53.060
well look I I don't know what Holly's thing is with Blizzard right now I don't know specifically

02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:56.900
well I might but I wouldn't I wouldn't try to tell it on the show for somebody else anyway

02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:02.060
but as I can tell you where I come from and it's you know obviously we play wow together

02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:06.300
you know I love wow I have the I wouldn't have a fucking podcast about wow if I didn't

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:10.380
love World of Warcraft but sometimes I get a little negative on Horde House because Blizzard

02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:14.860
just makes these decisions as a corporation that you just look at it and your jaw is just

02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:18.700
dropped like what the fuck are you doing like okay let me let me let me give you an analogy

02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:23.640
wait hold on let me give me an analogy okay like let's assume you've got a friend and

02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:28.100
like you know this is your bro he's your he's your guy he's one of your best friends you

02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:33.700
know you know whatever and suddenly this guy starts dating this girl and you just don't

02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:40.500
like her because she's drama and she just she is always making it about her and she

02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:45.700
causes him to make bad decisions and she's such just a negative influence on his life

02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:51.300
and she's just a bitch but you smile and you nod through it because you love your friend

02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:56.300
then you know he's happy even though you know she's really really poisonous for him but

02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:03.240
you just kind of just nod knowing that someday he'll wise up and call it off well that bitch's

02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:10.660
name is Activision definitely there's there's been times when I've seen some of the stuff

02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:14.700
they're supposedly going to do inside the game and I'm looking at this stuff and announcements

02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:18.620
I'm like what the fuck are they doing with this shit seriously are they going to actually

02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:24.020
make us pay for all this stuff that should be free in the first place and I love listening

02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:29.380
to other people's also other people's podcasts of course I listen to yours too Rob but it's

02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:34.020
kind of funny hearing that people come up like you you would say something and you'd

02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:37.420
be like okay I can believe blizzard's doing this what the fuck and then somebody else

02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:42.700
staying on the same line going you know what I think blizzard's going overboard with this

02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:46.260
and this is stupid and I can't believe they're actually doing this because they're trying

02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:51.540
to get you know more money into the pot so to speak so I think they could do about a

02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:56.020
lot of this stuff or you know it's everything doesn't have to be quote unquote a premium

02:27:56.020 --> 02:28:00.260
fee I think that's taking a little overboard and you know what's funny is that yet again

02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:04.500
we have a case of the worker bee is doing a great job and the worker bee in this case

02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:07.740
being the customer service reps you interact with they're representing their company very

02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:11.700
well the problem when we talk about issues we have with blizzard it is not with the worker

02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:16.260
bees it's with the queen bee it's with the people up top that are making the decisions

02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:22.420
and you're just your head I can't face palm give me that picture of captain John Luke

02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:27.420
Picard face palming because that's god half the stories I read on horde house need that

02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:32.620
caption yeah no joke all right I didn't need to bring more people like us the average people

02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:36.220
in there and let them tell them what's going on you know like I don't think this is gonna

02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:39.580
be wise you know you're gonna lose a lot of money to deal with this so that you know you

02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:42.840
would think that they have a better group of focus gamers but maybe they're just really

02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:46.820
worried about you know rumors and things getting out because you know the wow community is

02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:51.660
a very passionate group and anything we're saying guys if you're like oh god with the

02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:59.100
wow talk okay any mmo any mmo goes through this and wow just happens to be a big one

02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:03.540
but any mmo goes through this love hate relationship with their fan base my god look at final fantasy

02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:12.540
14 right now hello like the same problem what rob final what yeah exactly oh okay so all

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:16.940
right anyhow uh I gotta wrap up so you get more calls but thank you no problem anything

02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:21.180
really quick really quick what's up no anything else real quick you want to get out no no

02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:26.140
no nothing else all right goodbye I'm going to read you the line that I'm proud of okay

02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:35.020
go for it okay did I hang up I think I hung up no no hang up hang up did I hang up nope

02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:41.860
okay 1877 game olr using everyone skyborn songs radio okay jamie the character in the

02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:47.860
game is as admitted by one of the other antagonists a moron the same antagonist is a passive aggressive

02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:52.300
homicidal computer that takes steps to discourage the character being played not player there's

02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:56.460
also insult slung out towards overweight people and those of lower than average intelligence

02:29:56.460 --> 02:30:00.880
so should they also rise up in protest should the fatties and morons also call your station

02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:07.180
expect the same coverage as the adoptive parent you know what that's a very good point that

02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:14.340
the story overlooks is that um the character is supposed to be a moron yeah this is not

02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:19.780
somebody you're supposed to model yourself after this is an idiot bully as it said in

02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:25.620
the game designed by the greatest minds of their generation to create the dumbest moron

02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:31.580
who ever lived interesting I like that perspective that's pretty cool 1877 game olr or our username

02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:34.780
on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call and maybe I'll try to hang

right um last minute stories yes okay well real quick um there's some leaked video that

02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:10.940
kind of shows off some of the new features for fifa 12 uh looks kind of neat they're

02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:18.340
kind of making more realistic now they have um apparently you can do some they have unexpected

02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:23.480
behaviors that'll happen like for example um you know a defender coming in offensive

02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:30.380
player making a move that you know flips the player um you know uh apparently you can get

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:37.800
injuries and um you know realistic injuries they're going to have better uh dribbling

02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:44.140
and um basically kind of a whole new engine that they're putting in place here let me

02:31:44.140 --> 02:31:46.660
get to the phone so we've got another call coming in hi you're on orange laundry who's

02:31:46.660 --> 02:31:51.460
this yo guys it's in a court long time no see how y'all doing it's been a while how

02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:57.020
are you doing buddy just trying to make that paper you know make it rain all right what's

02:31:57.020 --> 02:32:03.080
up not much man not much blowing some time trying to get through la noir without cursing

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:06.820
my head off and waking up the entire neighborhood tell us a little bit about la noir you know

02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:12.380
i actually have a question real quick oh is time enjoying being blown stop all right la

02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:16.700
you're a dirty girl i want to yes i am yes i am she's off the hook tonight all right

02:32:16.700 --> 02:32:21.300
uh talking about um uh la noir a little bit because you know it's not a game i've played

02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:24.500
yet because i didn't think it would be something i was interested in because i'm not super

02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:27.680
into the whole grand theft auto thing like it's cool and all but i'm just not very good

02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:31.980
at it but in listening to bobby's show before us tonight he doesn't really play these types

02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:35.780
of games either but his callers are like no dude this is like a throwback to an adventure

02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:40.640
game what do you think of la noir oh so you guys actually haven't covered it on your show

02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:45.820
yet i thought i was chasing behind all my shows i'm trying to get in touch with can

02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:52.100
i ask you a question do you find the period specificness of the game a little bit bothersome

02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:57.780
no actually i enjoy it okay well i at first i didn't know what dan was playing at the

02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:01.060
time and then i was hearing the guy making the comments about jews and i was like what

02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:05.900
the hell are you playing uh oh yeah that first guy i didn't even think of that so yeah he's

02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:09.540
quite livid he is oh you should call the local news media and tell them how offended you

02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:14.100
are you know what i don't give a shit because it's a period specific game i just didn't

02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:17.900
know he was playing at the time so like what the hell are you listening to yeah that guy

02:33:17.900 --> 02:33:22.260
is a racist so of course he's gonna curse it up a bit yeah well anyway so so let me

02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:25.900
get back to the game a little bit no i mean i can't say we haven't covered la noir on

02:33:25.900 --> 02:33:29.460
the show i mean we've talked about it it's just none of us have yet to play it so we

02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:33.940
can't tell you like how it is as a game so i'm relying on you my friend how is uh how

02:33:33.940 --> 02:33:37.380
is la noir as a game tell us a little bit about it all right let me let me set it up

02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:42.180
to so i can describe it in as it'd be as rhetorical as possible but you get all the information

02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:47.580
in there uh it plays like grand theft auto but it doesn't play like grand theft auto

02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:52.020
and the fact that you are a police officer and you're not supposed to run amok which

02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:58.900
is the whole game the focus is on police investigation and the process of police investigation so

02:33:58.900 --> 02:34:04.720
and the highlighting of the facial animations and using that to be able to tell if people

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:12.340
are lying or not is the main focus of the game so see it's csi 1940s basically sounds

02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:21.380
a lot like law and order in 1940s yeah it's exactly what that is i mean this game you

02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:26.420
truly if you're not gonna cheat your way through it and use the online stuff uh it truly is

02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:30.660
a mental game you have to think your way through it and you can still get through the game

02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:34.820
and still fail left and right but you will get a completely different experience because

02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:40.260
you didn't real if you investigate a person and you're able to draw information out of

02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:45.740
them you have more things to use and search for later on in the case until you come to

02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:50.580
the end of it so am i hearing you right that you can't really lose this game it's just

02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:56.460
that there will be hallways you never go down if you don't do it well correct interesting

02:34:56.460 --> 02:35:02.380
yeah so the replay is in trying to do the cases better but if you happen to ace all

02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:06.620
the cases you pretty much see most of the content interesting i don't know however it's

02:35:06.620 --> 02:35:10.740
it right away also because the game is built like a twist to plot it's very easy to add

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:16.060
content to all they have to do is since all the tech is done get the actors do the recordings

02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:19.500
and insert them within the engine and you could kick this game could keep going you

02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:24.140
can have like five six volumes of cases they've probably already done and have some waiting

02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:29.300
in the can as far as the voice acting goes don't doubt it yeah it's like i'm having a

02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:34.100
ball even slipping the jargon every once in a while you know yeah but that's the way we

02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:38.380
are in the house here you know role players they gotta flex their role play muscles next

02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:42.860
you know that's the life of a pig man you just got to deal with it you know i i this

02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:46.460
game was i mean it was kind of it was on my radar certainly because everybody's been talking

02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:50.620
about it but i was like oh it's a rock star game i'm not i don't usually feel those so

02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:54.380
much whatever i'm sure i'm sure they're great games but i'll never probably get into it

02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:57.660
but then you know when i heard people tell you about it's like an old school pc adventure

02:35:57.660 --> 02:36:03.080
game with how you kind of like selecting so i was like really now now you i've i'm suddenly

02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:08.060
interested in this a lot more and just kind of sounds pretty cool yeah it's tied in really

02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:14.140
well they do they did their their uh due diligence on actually trying to make the city as closely

02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:21.060
to 19 uh late 1940s la as possible so like all the the billboards are where they're supposed

02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:26.800
to be and all this other stuff um i was gonna say alcan anagram in our chat room says this

02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:31.460
sounds like ace attorney interesting is it like like a phoenix right type thing yeah

02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:35.380
yeah it's actually closer than that than anything else i mean you do you do have to drive from

02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:39.620
point to point and they add the the grand theft auto things by responding to calls you'll

02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:44.580
hear a call for uh officer needs support this and that you roll up on a bank robbery or

02:36:44.580 --> 02:36:49.900
somebody's trying to rob a convenience store you know uh officers and chase you got to

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:54.260
cut them off i mean that's all in there as well as your standard stuff of driving your

02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:59.940
car but the focus is on the investigation itself like for instance for example one of

02:36:59.940 --> 02:37:05.700
the cases involves a woman and her niece getting put in the car while they're drugged and and

02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:10.220
the car goes over a cliff but they survive it so you do you do your interviews to figure

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:14.420
out what's going on you later on tail her and figure out she's got ties to the mob and

02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:18.860
she's going after the guy that drugged them and put them in the car if you don't get to

02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:23.100
the spot if you get there in time you can catch them in the act of trying to toss the

02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:27.580
place and arrest them if you don't if you take too long to get there you have to deal

02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:30.980
with the aftermath and you have to use your csi skills to figure out what they were looking

02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:37.140
for hmm so yeah it's the way they put the gameplay in there plus later on the order

02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:42.940
that you investigate the locations determines who's available when so if you go to like

02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:45.940
for instance there's this grocer you have to investigate but for some reason they're

02:37:45.940 --> 02:37:50.020
closed until like two three o'clock in the afternoon so if you go there too early you'll

02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:53.980
miss your chance to do something else like catch this one guy while he's in the bar you

02:37:53.980 --> 02:37:58.500
have to go hunt him down later interesting yeah so the entire case is interwoven like

02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:01.860
that like a big twist of plot but let me ask you another question real quick for let you

02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:06.460
go because I want to make sure we can free up for more calls but I've heard a lot about

02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:11.020
how this game really seems to be pushing that line between game and movie like I've heard

02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:15.500
about some cases where it's actually being considered art I think somebody I don't know

02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:18.420
some gallery or something was actually kind of putting this game on display or what have

02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:22.340
you what do you think about this game is this game really pushing the envelope between what

02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:28.580
is a movie television visual art and a video game which not everyone considers art if you're

02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:34.580
Roger Ebert well let me let me say it like this I was watching you guys familiar with

02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:40.980
red letter media no okay he's the red letter media is the guys who went behind Mr. Plinkett

02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:45.680
and ripping apart the Star Wars trilogy and they're like their movies are their reviews

02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.060
are extremely in-depth and they started up a show they mentioned the fact that movies

02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:56.940
have become the lowest form of entertainment as far as outlook and what you expect from

02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:02.680
them like you know like some people aren't willing to throw 10 bucks at a bad movie and

02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:06.220
the way movies have been going down now maybe they're not making as much money as they could

02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:10.180
be if they're spending more time writing scripts and stuff they are doing that in gaming so

02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:14.220
that has stepped up as far as the public eye is looking for entertainment and this is just

02:39:14.220 --> 02:39:21.700
going to add fuel to that fire I mean the fact that the the facial expressions add so

02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:27.040
much to the way you're trying to I mean literally I was second-guessing almost every decision

02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:30.560
I was making on whether these people were lying or not based off what I knew about the

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:36.740
case and it was driving me nuts interesting and the way they added there's a small audio

02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:40.580
cue that lets you know whether or not you picked if they're telling the truth if you

02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:44.740
doubt their answer or if they're flat-out lying they have a little three-note piano

02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:48.580
thing to let you know when you pick correctly incorrectly the instant you push the button

02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:54.060
so it just adds to that suspense you're going to hear that tone and when you mess it up

02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:58.000
you just want to go rage comic all over the thing but it's great I love every minute of

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.980
it all right well you guys have sold me that I need to check it out I don't know if I'll

02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:04.860
drop $60 for it but I'm certainly gonna rent it and check it out yeah yeah definitely worth

02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:08.220

on out of here for the night Loki okay so last story here this is kind of funny they

02:40:52.940 --> 02:41:04.940
have Kenji Inafune is actually in the new Japanese RPG Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 it's

02:41:04.940 --> 02:41:12.140
a sequel to the Hyperdimension Neptunia game that came out I believe last year I know over

02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:19.740
here in March basically he plays I don't really know himself but there is screenshots of him

02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:25.560
shooting a laser out of his mouth and he also appears to be a weapon that this woman is

02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:31.180
using and it's kind of like console wars the game because each woman is like a different

02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:37.800
it represents a different console hmm but it's weird all right well that's gonna do

02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.300
it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio tonight we're gonna now go around and get
