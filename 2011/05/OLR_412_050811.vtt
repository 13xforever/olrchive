Today, May 8th, 2011, Sony is on Day 18 of PlayStation Network Outage, has a dev kit

00:19.840 --> 00:25.000
for the next Xbox when spotted in a game developer, and Club Nintendo makes a controversial change

00:25.000 --> 00:32.880
to their privacy policy. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello, my friends out there on the internet

00:32.880 --> 00:37.440
and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It's the show where every gamer

00:37.440 --> 00:41.160
has a voice. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours here

00:41.160 --> 00:47.200
live with my co-host with me. Of course, the one, the only, the awesome DarkStalker, Jamie

00:47.200 --> 00:53.440
Summers. Heck yeah. How are you doing? Awesome. And also very humble, might I add. Heck yeah.

00:53.440 --> 00:58.400
All right. Well, happy Mother's Day to you. What? You're a mommy to Shermy, the kitty.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.840
Oh yeah. Well then happy Mother's Day to you too. Oh, well thank you very much. I appreciate

01:02.840 --> 01:08.240
it. All right. Also joining us tonight, Tech Master, Loki. Hi. And please pass along a

01:08.240 --> 01:12.280
happy Mother's Day to the Mrs. Forest. I will do that. So how are you doing, Loki? I'm doing

01:12.280 --> 01:16.880
fine. I see you're chugging along there on Portal 2. Yes, I am. So awesome. I beat a

01:16.880 --> 01:22.360
game this week. I beat Portal 2. That's a huge landmark for me, you guys, because I

01:22.360 --> 01:25.000
have the worst. If you listen to this show for any length of time, you know, I have the

01:25.000 --> 01:30.760
worst gaming ADD in the world. I play a game for literally five minutes. Then I'm like,

01:30.760 --> 01:34.560
ooh, Shiny, another game. I'll go play that. I mean, there's so much out there to play.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.360
There's so many games that come out every week. I mean, not just like, you know, in

01:38.360 --> 01:43.080
retail, but you have the download games that are available. Well, you know, we're available

01:43.080 --> 01:48.240
on one console. And you know, so on and so forth. There's just so much to play. PC and

01:48.240 --> 01:52.940
so on. I don't always get around everything. But yeah, I actually played Portal 2 to completion

01:52.940 --> 02:00.360
and beat it. Yay. So I feel accomplished. I don't know why. Also, it's short. That helps.

02:00.360 --> 02:06.200
Rob. What? The potato is not a lie. I don't want to spoil it because I know there's some

02:06.200 --> 02:11.440
people that still haven't played it. I have to say the ending. Well, I lulled at the very,

02:11.440 --> 02:15.600
very, very, very end. But for the rest of it, I was kind of like, oh, that's it? I was

02:15.600 --> 02:18.320
kind of, oh, I thought there was going to be a little bit more, but I think something

02:18.320 --> 02:23.000
in my head, I made up a plot point in my head that didn't come to fruition. And I think

02:23.000 --> 02:27.440
that's why it was a little bit like, oh, I see. I was a little let down because I wasn't

02:27.440 --> 02:30.600
right on that point. I was right on everything else. But then when the other thing didn't

02:30.600 --> 02:35.320
come true, I was like, oh, I guess I can't tell the future after all. All right. Anyhow,

02:35.320 --> 02:39.260
join us in our chat room, chat.orangelandrado.com as we do tape live every Sunday night at

02:39.260 --> 02:44.100
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at all games radio, www.allgames.com right

02:44.100 --> 02:47.800
after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We got a lot of gaming news tonight. We're going to

02:47.800 --> 02:51.740
get into a list list in part B tonight that will be themed around of course the big, big

02:51.740 --> 02:56.400
story and so much more in just a little while. But first let's get into how we always start

02:56.400 --> 03:00.780
the show off. How was your gaming week? Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week? I played

03:00.780 --> 03:07.920
Portal 2 and got very sick and actually threw up this time. And I played some World of Warcraft.

03:07.920 --> 03:14.840
And in World of Warcraft, I played Bejeweled, which I think it broke on me because it stopped

03:14.840 --> 03:20.160
letting me fail for real because it's supposed to actually drop enough blocks that eventually

03:20.160 --> 03:24.280
it just, the game will crash on you. Well, not crash, but the game will just end because

03:24.280 --> 03:28.520
you don't have any more moves. And that never happened. So finally I just said, forget it

03:28.520 --> 03:36.560
and went to bed. And then I played Peggle. Yay, Peggle. Yes, I love Peggle. They haven't

03:36.560 --> 03:41.940
done anything with Peggle in a while. It seems like there was the coming to E3 super Peggle.

03:41.940 --> 03:48.960
There was the one that came out with a portal to the valve edition was like extreme Peggle.

03:48.960 --> 03:53.080
It's a freebie on steam. I don't remember that one. I think I missed it. Like a little

03:53.080 --> 03:57.800
like 10 level Peggle, but it's fun. I played the Peggle in wow. I played that too. There

03:57.800 --> 04:01.840
hasn't been a pop cap wow marriage in a while. Well, I mean, I guess there was the peace

04:01.840 --> 04:07.320
bloom versus ghouls or whatever. Cause I haven't done that. Oh, it's in a Hillsbrad mountains.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.760
Do you know where Taran Mill is? It's not far from there. Yeah. I've been going around

04:11.760 --> 04:17.400
actually looking for Easter eggs. Like the one I sent you. Did you get it? I did. I figured

04:17.400 --> 04:21.320
we haven't had that one pop up. So I've been going around looking for all the different

04:21.320 --> 04:25.560
Easter eggs. And the next thing I'm going to do is try to get into the, uh, the troll

04:25.560 --> 04:30.160
crypt because you can still do it, but you can't do it the way you used to be able to

04:30.160 --> 04:34.960
do it. You know what I'm talking about? I think so. Yes. With the upside down centers.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.480
What you should do is you should go for your Explorer achievement if you don't already

04:38.480 --> 04:42.000
have it. Cause it forces you to kind of visit the whole world. I've already got it on, um,

04:42.000 --> 04:52.440
ERISA. Okay. Well, except I don't have the, um, the, uh, uh, yes. All the cataclysm one

04:52.440 --> 04:59.600
yet because I skipped the under the underwater kingdom and I've just recently gone back and

04:59.600 --> 05:05.040
so I could get my, uh, exalted with them. And now I'm just like, people take me on heroics

05:05.040 --> 05:07.880
please. Well, I don't want to turn this too much into the wild show cause I already have

05:07.880 --> 05:11.360
a spinoff show for a while, but I do want to quickly say, um, you know, just, just even

05:11.360 --> 05:14.340
today you do find new stuff in the game once in a while. And that's kind of the fun thing

05:14.340 --> 05:17.880
about a virtual world, no matter what MMO you play. I think this can really be expanded

05:17.880 --> 05:22.200
to any MMO out there. Rift, Star Trek, whatever it is you play. It's always fun to sometimes

05:22.200 --> 05:26.320
go just go explore and like find new things. Like even just today, salacious pop was like,

05:26.320 --> 05:30.560
Hey Rob, I, I, I see this house here I've never seen before. That's kind of, it's not

05:30.560 --> 05:34.840
really on the map or anything. It's just like up here in the hill. And this guy wants junk

05:34.840 --> 05:37.600
boxes. I can't figure out what he's for. So it was just, you know, sometimes you find

05:37.600 --> 05:41.600
random stuff. Did you find the place where the animals have weapons? No. Where's that?

05:41.600 --> 05:44.920
There's um, I'll find it during the course of show, but there's a place that's like the

05:44.920 --> 05:48.380
only way you can get there is if you have a flying mount. And I think at the part that

05:48.380 --> 05:51.800
you're normally there, you don't have one. I think actually if I'm right, I think it's

05:51.800 --> 05:57.120
the Tauran starting area, but it's one place up at the top of the map that you can only

05:57.120 --> 06:02.280
get there with a flying mount. And then randomly different animals are wearing helmets. Okay.

06:02.280 --> 06:08.720
The prairie dogs wear helmets and carry knives. The rabbits carry battle axes and the rats

06:08.720 --> 06:14.000
wear skull helmets and carry two double barreled shotguns. That's kind of awesome. And they

06:14.000 --> 06:17.480
get bigger and then all of a sudden they'll shrink down and go to normal size. And I'm

06:17.480 --> 06:21.720
also going to try to wake up early in the morning and do the gold jar children thing.

06:21.720 --> 06:26.340
The only Easter, the only Easter egg area I've really explored was the one, it's right

06:26.340 --> 06:30.240
outside Stormwind. It's up in the Hills and there's all these sheep, just tons and tons

06:30.240 --> 06:33.840
of sheep that you can kill for the critter achievement. And if you kill them all though,

06:33.840 --> 06:38.760
the guy comes out of his house and he goes, what's wrong with you? That's just wrong.

06:38.760 --> 06:43.120
He starts yelling at you about what a bastard you are. There's another place, but you kill

06:43.120 --> 06:48.040
them. There's another place that has, um, and this will be the end of it, but this one

06:48.040 --> 06:54.160
was one I thought was really nice is there's a monument and a dwarf in red named Roush

06:54.160 --> 07:01.360
kneeling in front of it. And it reads, uh, rest in peace, Anthony T. Stark. People were

07:01.360 --> 07:04.040
calling that the iron man thing, but it's not. It's actually for a guy who was a friend

07:04.040 --> 07:11.000
of the developers and Roush was his character, the dwarf. So they made him an NPC. Very cool.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.300
I thought it was a nice gesture and the smiley face. I'll say this about another MMO, Final

07:15.300 --> 07:18.480
Fantasy 11. You know, I played that for many years before I played. Wow. One of the things

07:18.480 --> 07:22.080
I used to really like about that is that I really liked the ambience of that game. You

07:22.080 --> 07:25.600
know what? The graphics are more first person. I mean, they can be third person depending

07:25.600 --> 07:29.480
on how you play, but I just really liked exploring areas in that game because there were some

07:29.480 --> 07:34.440
really beautiful areas and great music. And because of the way the game was designed,

07:34.440 --> 07:39.620
you wouldn't always like see every area for a long time. So as you were progressing, which

07:39.620 --> 07:42.840
could sometimes take months and months, you would find these new areas and hear new music

07:42.840 --> 07:47.900
and it was just really cool. I mean, it was a frustrating ass grind. That's why I was

07:47.900 --> 07:54.920
so disappointed that 14 was such crap. I mean, sorry to say, I don't know what's going to

07:54.920 --> 07:58.400
happen to 14. We haven't heard of what's going on there in a while. I don't know if they're

07:58.400 --> 08:04.660
going to try to reboot or what. I don't know. Like a sliver in my pinky, the extra part

08:04.660 --> 08:09.000
of my pinky nail. I'd like to come back and make it like really awesome, but I don't know.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.520
I think it might be a lost cause at this point. Anyhow, just update 11 with new graphics and

08:13.520 --> 08:18.240
stuff and that's all you need to do. The game's awesome and not as pain in the ass of the

08:18.240 --> 08:22.720
grind. They did change a lot of stuff in 11 since you and I left. Like the level sinking

08:22.720 --> 08:27.720
thing is huge and you know, but there's only so much you can like cram into an old engine

08:27.720 --> 08:32.520
and that's where Warcraft starting to have that problem. Much different outfits. Seriously.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.520
There's so many different armors that change your look in world of Warcraft, but really

08:36.520 --> 08:43.280
in Final Fantasy 11, it's just like, oh, I'm wearing the bondage gear. Oh, now I'm wearing

08:43.280 --> 08:49.840
white mage robes. They're just very few new things and you can tell what anybody is by

08:49.840 --> 08:54.160
looking at them. And the other problem 14 had was that it tried to change it up too

08:54.160 --> 08:58.920
much. Like instead of being just a white mage and a black mage, now you could be a gladiator

08:58.920 --> 09:04.120
or a Theramaterge. Like what? That's not why I play Final Fantasy to be a fucking Theramaterge.

09:04.120 --> 09:08.680
Seriously, what is the point of having the same races but changing the names? Yeah, that

09:08.680 --> 09:13.160
was retarded. Silly. Anyway. Okay. Enough fan memo ranting. Let's talk about other guys.

09:13.160 --> 09:19.760
By the way, I must say that my wife's character, well, before she had the hairdo change, but

09:19.760 --> 09:24.560
she looked like Mel's Tarot Tarot at one point. Actually, no, she does look like Mel's Tarot

09:24.560 --> 09:28.340
Tarot now. Wait, wait, your wife had a Final Fantasy 11 character? No, I'm saying she's

09:28.340 --> 09:32.840
playing Animal Crossing. Her character in Animal Crossing looks like Mel's little Tarot

09:32.840 --> 09:40.600
Tarot because Mel looked like a little grandma. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always cracked me up. Awesome.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.600
There are those days, like I'll see those sales on Steam where it's like, Final Fantasy

09:43.600 --> 09:48.800
11 is only $20 for the uber mega OMG I can't believe it version. And I'm like, I kind of

09:48.800 --> 09:54.640
want to go back. I kind of want to go back. Resist, resist. I will. I will. Alright, anyhow.

09:54.640 --> 09:59.200
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing? Only really three things.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.680
Wait, more importantly, the chat room wants to know for the betting pool tonight, what

10:03.680 --> 10:11.240
food did you bring to the show? Uh, I brought a Carl's Jr. Western burger. There you go.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.760
I don't think anyone guessed Carl's Jr. We got a lot of losers in chat tonight. I don't

10:14.760 --> 10:19.120
normally get Carl's Jr. Every now and then I get Western. It was today. It was like I

10:19.120 --> 10:25.040
had a big burger for lunch and I didn't really know what I wanted to get. So I just picked

10:25.040 --> 10:28.680
up something because I, you know, if I didn't eat anything, I'd be hungry, but I didn't

10:28.680 --> 10:32.840
feel like anything. I almost brought nothing. I almost just had red bulls and it bought

10:32.840 --> 10:36.560
the wrong size red bull too. So these are like a red bull and a half. I'm still gonna

10:36.560 --> 10:40.600
drink two of them though. I had a red bull last night cause I was up until four 30. It's

10:40.600 --> 10:45.720
still the color of pee. It is, but it keeps you awake. I don't care. It makes my brain

10:45.720 --> 10:50.880
function. All right. Video games. What have you been playing this week? Break man in our

10:50.880 --> 10:55.640
chat asks, what's a Carl's Jr. If you're on the East coast, I think they call it Hardee's.

10:55.640 --> 11:03.040
Hardee's. Anyways, um, I played portal two, a lot of portal two and progressing nicely

11:03.040 --> 11:09.440
through it. See, I started off on the 360, but I decided, you know, okay, here's, here's

11:09.440 --> 11:15.600
that window. And I don't know if you'd, it's not technically piracy because I do own a

11:15.600 --> 11:22.800
copy of it. Just, I'm not playing the copy that I bought. Um, so I have the 360 copy.

11:22.800 --> 11:28.560
I have the PS3 copy that I got for free through my work, which has the PC steam copy. But

11:28.560 --> 11:33.900
as you know, PlayStation network is down, so I can't download my steam copy. So I pirated

11:33.900 --> 11:40.040
the PC copy and I'm playing that. So technically I own it on PC. I just am not playing that

11:40.040 --> 11:46.200
copy, but who cares? I'm enjoying it just fine on my laptop cause it runs very, very

11:46.200 --> 11:53.960
great. I can max out everything and um, let's see. And then I've been playing actually with

11:53.960 --> 11:59.000
my 360 controller, which is awesome. It was kind of a headache to get it to work. Well

11:59.000 --> 12:01.840
originally it was a headache, but until I figured out they have to have the controller

12:01.840 --> 12:07.040
turned on before you start the game. Now it works just fine. You know, it's the only game

12:07.040 --> 12:13.360
that seems like that's the issue for. Um, okay. So then beyond portal, I've been playing

12:13.360 --> 12:21.840
um, unpleasant horse, which is awesome. Especially throwing little flying horses into a meat

12:21.840 --> 12:30.280
grinders. Um, and then of course grand theft auto. That's it. Of course it just wouldn't

12:30.280 --> 12:33.920
be a Loki week without grand theft auto. We always play grand theft auto. The only time

12:33.920 --> 12:37.280
we're not going to play grand theft auto is when grand theft auto or another grand theft

12:37.280 --> 12:41.720
auto comes out. Then it will just be new grand theft auto. Exactly. Uh, video games I've

12:41.720 --> 12:45.440
been playing this week. Um, sadly nothing new. I mean, uh, there hasn't been a lot of

12:45.440 --> 12:49.680
the download games lately that have been very appealing, uh, that I've wanted to grab and

12:49.680 --> 12:54.280
nothing in retail is really jumping out at me right now. Uh, so, uh, just reiterating

12:54.280 --> 12:57.960
the same stuff I'd be portal to, as I said, at the top of the show, that was a big accomplishment.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.640
Still need to work on co-op. Mikkel, Tom, I know you're listening. You work on co-op,

13:01.640 --> 13:06.120
uh, more. I'll join you if, uh, well, I've got my PS3 copy and they'll, I'll join you

13:06.120 --> 13:10.480
once the network comes. Yeah, screw Mikkel top. We'll do it. All right. All right. Sounds

13:10.480 --> 13:15.840
good. Anyhow. Uh, let's see what else, uh, I've been playing or can't you do split screen?

13:15.840 --> 13:21.680
You can, but one of our controller PS3 controllers is still in a box. So there's only one controller.

13:21.680 --> 13:27.720
Well, how can we get it out of this impenetrable cardboard box? No, I know if only there were

13:27.720 --> 13:33.760
a way to break into the, the fortress that is the cardboard box. It's in a box. We don't

13:33.760 --> 13:37.960
know which box it's in. It's, it's like playing a game show. Well, it's very easy. There's

13:37.960 --> 13:42.240
a very simple solution to that. You rip open all the boxes, the PSN controller, the other

13:42.240 --> 13:47.120
box has the lube. We don't know which box you rip open all the boxes, dump them on the

13:47.120 --> 13:53.960
floor and then you'll find it. That's it. And then the cats have a new play space, which

13:53.960 --> 13:58.720
by the way, do you know we portal cats just tangent here? Cause I need to say this. We

13:58.720 --> 14:02.480
bought the cats a new bed, which I understand it takes cats time to get adjusted to a bed.

14:02.480 --> 14:06.640
We bought the cats an awesome pink bed with leopard print. It's the tackiest fucking thing

14:06.640 --> 14:11.160
you'll ever see. And I love it. And uh, yeah. Where did the cat decide to make its home?

14:11.160 --> 14:15.680
In the pile of dirty laundry. Of course you buy them nice things and they don't appreciate

14:15.680 --> 14:21.680
it. That's a cat earlier. I got Shermie this really nice series of cat beds that should

14:21.680 --> 14:26.840
just ignore. And then I pick up this one for 13 bucks on sale and it's her favorite thing.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.680
Just give it time because I know these things take like my cat. I got her a nice new bed

14:31.680 --> 14:37.920
and she was scared of it because it looked like a cat. Do you like your bed? Yeah. Dan

14:37.920 --> 14:42.760
says in the other room she slept on a box. She slept on a box. I had a cat that tried

14:42.760 --> 14:47.120
that he was a little bit bigger than the shoe box, but he ever since he was a kitten would

14:47.120 --> 14:52.560
sleep in the shoe box until he looked like a muffin loaf pouring over the edges of this

14:52.560 --> 14:57.560
box, but he would still cram laundry though. Then they have to use the cat bed. No, no.

14:57.560 --> 15:01.880
You know what they use when there's no dirty laundry? They use my chair. Oh, that's what

15:01.880 --> 15:04.520
they do. Anyway, I don't want to talk about cats. I want to talk about games, but I also

15:04.520 --> 15:07.720
want to talk about this comment. Mielethov just IME. He's like, well, just tell me when

15:07.720 --> 15:11.440
you want to play portal two and I'll play. But he also said, apparently I missed the

15:11.440 --> 15:17.560
remark about I'd go back for $5 to final fantasy 11 if you would to kind of like a suicide

15:17.560 --> 15:25.880
pact. Oh, sad. I like that. Oh man. If I had the time, I know, right. I would just get

15:25.880 --> 15:32.080
old times. Let's, let's just go not have a life again. And that's like, so I don't know.

15:32.080 --> 15:38.320
Uh, nonconformist because you know, everybody's like MMO. Wow. You know, fuck that. We're

15:38.320 --> 15:45.240
going to final fantasy 11. What? It's like, I don't know. Just, I missed grandma Tarou.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.360
Okay. Look, other games I've played, speaking of Final Fantasy, I'm still playing Final

15:48.360 --> 15:51.800
Fantasy four on the PSP. I play it for like 30 minutes before I go to bed every night.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.600
It's a nice little way to kind of, you know, rest before bed. I, I, of course I love that

15:55.600 --> 15:59.560
game on the super Nintendo. So of course I love the PSN port and I'm doing, I'm doing

15:59.560 --> 16:03.240
kind of the Jamie thing where I have to play it chronologically. Like, you know, where

16:03.240 --> 16:07.340
you guys are doing the final fantasy marathon. Well, I'm starting with four and then I'll

16:07.340 --> 16:11.160
play the interlude and then I'll play after years finally, which I played like a little

16:11.160 --> 16:16.680
bit of on the Wii, but I want to play it on the PSP cause I love the new graphics and

16:16.680 --> 16:20.760
it really is just a great looking game and I hope people didn't overlook it because it

16:20.760 --> 16:24.400
came out the same week as portal. Cause that would just be, I really want five and six

16:24.400 --> 16:32.920
to come out the portal. Exactly. Shiny. Um, otherwise I can't play portal on a PSP. That's

16:32.920 --> 16:37.240
most that's, yeah, that's true. He can't play portal in bed. Well actually you probably

16:37.240 --> 16:43.080
could play portal on a PSP if they hacked the, uh, you know, their streaming thing because

16:43.080 --> 16:46.880
I think it has enough buttons to where you can do it and just wouldn't build a zoom who

16:46.880 --> 16:50.160
needs zoom. Oh, and I also played a little bit of mortal combat, which would be very,

16:50.160 --> 16:54.520
very important at the end of the show. So I remember that. And then, um, let's see what

16:54.520 --> 16:59.600
else. Um, Oh, there was one other thing I wanted to mention. Oh, star craft too. Even

16:59.600 --> 17:03.680
though I am terrible, I've said that's the, that's the one I need to encourage a league

17:03.680 --> 17:06.760
for because I always talk to people about star craft too. And everybody I talk to is

17:06.760 --> 17:10.960
like, yeah, I'm really bad too. And I'm like, and nobody wants to play online because everybody's

17:10.960 --> 17:16.320
bad. So we need like a bad league. I have never played star craft too. It's it's the

17:16.320 --> 17:21.400
last RTS I played was red alert. The first red alert. Did you ever play like the original

17:21.400 --> 17:26.560
war craft or war craft too? I played war craft like once because I got a demo disc with PC

17:26.560 --> 17:32.060
gamer. That's how long ago on the CD ROM. It's really not that different. I mean it

17:32.060 --> 17:36.980
grant it's new graphics and all that stuff. I mean, but at its core, the old game or the,

17:36.980 --> 17:41.720
the star craft series is really like the old war craft games. Just, you know, I'm sure

17:41.720 --> 17:45.600
star craft fans get driven bonkers and I say that, but really at its core, it's kind of

17:45.600 --> 17:50.600
what it is, you know, collection, build buildings, build units, attack, kill, destroy, and so

17:50.600 --> 17:55.360
forth. So that was my gaming week. Join us in our chat room at chat dot orange launch

17:55.360 --> 17:59.560
radio.com. If you want to chat with us with tonight's news, we'll be reading a random

17:59.560 --> 18:04.960
comments in chat throughout the show. Um, silver Sonic in our chat room, for example,

18:04.960 --> 18:09.280
says, didn't you mean on Twitter that you played Minecraft? Uh, I, I played that last

18:09.280 --> 18:13.160
week. My review on Minecraft was last week and let me put it this way. I didn't play

18:13.160 --> 18:19.700
it again this week. This is Rob's review. No, it wasn't that I was kind of like, I see,

18:19.700 --> 18:23.320
you know what I think it is. I think Minecraft is a game for artists. I think Minecraft is

18:23.320 --> 18:27.520
very much a game for artists because it's about like creating and you know, destroying

18:27.520 --> 18:31.540
and chiseling. No, I have a question for me. I can't even draw a fucking, I have a question

18:31.540 --> 18:37.120
for you though. If Minecraft weren't say little pixelated blocks and they were Legos, would

18:37.120 --> 18:42.000
that make the game more? I love the little Lego builder. That's, I love that. You can

18:42.000 --> 18:45.760
download this thing on the PC. I think I mentioned this last week. You can make your own little

18:45.760 --> 18:51.260
Lego things and then actually have them ship to you instructions on how to build it because

18:51.260 --> 18:55.120
the computer program remembers how you built it and like, I guess a logic and they will

18:55.120 --> 18:59.200
send you all the appropriate bricks. So it's like this thing for people to do like eight

18:59.200 --> 19:04.480
bit sprites in Legos. That sounds more interesting to me than it really. It's way more interesting

19:04.480 --> 19:09.600
than Minecraft actually because I get something tangible out of it. You know, and not to knock

19:09.600 --> 19:15.680
people that spend a lot of time making stuff in Minecraft, but, um, you know, be also in

19:15.680 --> 19:19.880
Minecraft, you know, if you combine Minecraft, like the world and being able to build everything

19:19.880 --> 19:24.000
like that with ZZT where you can actually make your own games. Fuck yes, I would be

19:24.000 --> 19:30.200
all over that shit. Oh my God. Now we're talking like, I'm just shocked that there's like Minecraft

19:30.200 --> 19:35.840
podcasts and all this stuff. Like I'm, I don't, you know, there's a lot of videos of people

19:35.840 --> 19:41.280
like this is my basement and I want to support all indie podcasters. So look, I'm not knocking

19:41.280 --> 19:45.920
it. Like if you're into that, that's awesome. It's just, I, I feel like I, I feel so not

19:45.920 --> 19:51.240
cool for not understanding Minecraft. There's not, not even like that old crotchety man

19:51.240 --> 19:55.360
sitting in the rocking chair going, these kids in their Minecraft, I don't understand.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.480
We're not like knocking people saying, Oh, well you're wrong for liking Minecraft. It's

19:58.480 --> 20:04.400
just, we don't, don't get it yet. I don't know. It, you know, it might be something.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.040
The problem is I don't have enough free time to tinker with something like this when I

20:08.040 --> 20:13.400
can be playing other things. And you know, if I ever came across, you know, an extra

20:13.400 --> 20:19.840
12 hours in a day where I could just sit there and build in Minecraft, then yeah, that might

20:19.840 --> 20:26.720
be a fun game for me, but I just don't have the time. Although if you want to like say

20:26.720 --> 20:30.800
port that over Nintendo and put some Animal Crossing characters in that and sell it to

20:30.800 --> 20:34.920
my wife, then I might get the play a little bit more. All right. Go into our chat room

20:34.920 --> 20:39.040
at chat.orangelandtrader.com for some comments. Kaijuto in our chat room says, to understand

20:39.040 --> 20:43.000
Minecraft, you have to get the pay version. It has a lot more. The free version is a joke,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.740
but yeah, but if the free version isn't that great, then it doesn't really make me want

20:46.740 --> 20:52.520
to get the pay version, but I get it. Let's see. I apologize if I mispronounced this,

20:52.520 --> 20:58.600
but Entitelus, Entitelitus, Entitelitus says, what's the name of that 8-bit Zelda clone

20:58.600 --> 21:03.840
on the PS3 that came out a while back? That was a 3d.heroes. Yeah, that game was cool.

21:03.840 --> 21:08.920
I want another one of those. I'm surprised I never got sued. Uh, let's see. Black Wolf

21:08.920 --> 21:13.840
in our chat room says, it's okay, Rob. I don't understand. Wow. Yet some people do wow podcasts

21:13.840 --> 21:17.560
too. No, I'm with you Black Wolf. I don't understand wow either, but because you guys

21:17.560 --> 21:22.880
just aren't cool. It's sorry to say it like, you know, I'm not, I still like you guys.

21:22.880 --> 21:27.940
You're just not cool. I just, I never understood, you know, just from looking at the outside

21:27.940 --> 21:32.120
in my, you know, five second opinion of wow, you know, I just don't get it. It doesn't,

21:32.120 --> 21:37.720
I don't, it doesn't look appealing to me at all. Like I just Final Fantasy, it was a little

21:37.720 --> 21:41.080
bit more appealing because I understand, you know, a little bit of the lore at least, and

21:41.080 --> 21:46.320
I recognize the characters and that kind of thing. Wow. I never played enough, you know,

21:46.320 --> 21:51.240
Warcraft to begin with. I don't care. Here's, here's the thing about wow. Like I'll just

21:51.240 --> 21:55.260
like sum it up as fast as I can. It's really about the people that I play with that keep

21:55.260 --> 21:58.880
me doing it because if the people weren't there that I was playing with, I would've

21:58.880 --> 22:02.920
canceled my account a long time ago. I got really close this past week. Oh my God. I

22:02.920 --> 22:06.440
got so frustrated at something in the game. I really wanted to cancel my account, but

22:06.440 --> 22:10.760
I kind of have that podcast now and there's also the community of people I really like

22:10.760 --> 22:15.400
that also play it. So, and that's probably why the Minecraft people do their thing cause

22:15.400 --> 22:19.240
they've got a community too, but I'm just not able to be in that community because of

22:19.240 --> 22:24.680
a terrible, terrible, terrible artist. That's what it is. Well, I'm just saying, you know,

22:24.680 --> 22:32.320
the, uh, the best little tarot house in vanity is not that bad of a name either. All right,

22:32.320 --> 22:35.880
let's uh, let's move on. We need to get to some gaming news quickly. Housekeeping, uh,

22:35.880 --> 22:40.400
visit our website, orange on trader.com. Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange

22:40.400 --> 22:45.320
lounge. And we're also on Twitter as O L R. It's like we have a different username everywhere.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.840
Sorry about that, but it's kind of a long name. All right, let's get to some gaming

22:48.840 --> 22:54.440
news once again. I think y'all know where we're going to go tonight right off the bat.

22:54.440 --> 23:01.280
Let's talk about the Atari. No, um, fucking love Atari combat rocks. Yes. Uh, station.com

23:01.280 --> 23:09.480
part of a Sony online. Apparently Sony online has gone down. Uh, they've dropped the, uh,

23:09.480 --> 23:15.200
or they suspend their services after they discovered an issue. That issue being that

23:15.200 --> 23:23.040
their, um, network was also infiltrated as part of that, uh, PlayStation network infiltration

23:23.040 --> 23:31.320
from hackers. Uh, apparently also they lost, uh, 12,700 credit card account numbers and

23:31.320 --> 23:39.360
24.6 million accounts were compromised. That sucks. And of course they're letting everybody

23:39.360 --> 23:45.280
know, no, this wasn't a second attack. It was just part of the first attack. Yeah, that

23:45.280 --> 23:50.320
makes it all better. You know that they got it one swoop instead of twice because twice

23:50.320 --> 24:01.840
would just be ridiculous now, wouldn't it? Um, so yeah, uh, that does suck. And, um,

24:01.840 --> 24:07.640
you know, they really haven't said what they're doing, at least on the Sony online, um, side.

24:07.640 --> 24:12.120
I mean, I know there's a lot of stuff we'll be getting into about the PlayStation network,

24:12.120 --> 24:18.920
but uh, that sucks. And of course, I think for like the people that are playing, um,

24:18.920 --> 24:22.640
you know, the games on there, I think you're getting like a free month or something. So

24:22.640 --> 24:28.760
not good. It's just kind of interesting that this all comes out the week that, oh yeah,

24:28.760 --> 24:32.840
we're going to get the system back online. Oh shit, we got hacked more. But here's the

24:32.840 --> 24:42.440
thing though. It was from an outdated database, they said from 2007 and it says of the, um,

24:42.440 --> 24:50.920
12,700 total, 4,300, I guess, were from Japan. Um, and then I guess some more from other

24:50.920 --> 24:59.240
European countries. They're saying though that, um, that the, uh, US credit and debit

24:59.240 --> 25:04.840
card numbers and expiration dates, not the security codes were part of that database.

25:04.840 --> 25:09.680
I actually have kind of a crazy question. Has anyone asked this question of Sony yet?

25:09.680 --> 25:14.400
I'm not sure, but I've got to put it out there. Why the fuck did they have credit card information

25:14.400 --> 25:20.000
from 2007? Why are they not required by law to purge that information? Why do they need

25:20.000 --> 25:25.920
it? You don't need credit card information from 2007, do you? I mean, maybe they need

25:25.920 --> 25:32.040
it for tax. It might be a service server backup or something like that. I don't know. Well,

25:32.040 --> 25:38.440
I don't care. You should have to purge that by law. I understand the only benefit of keeping

25:38.440 --> 25:43.160
information that only this just comes from working with loans is that you can go back

25:43.160 --> 25:49.400
and find issues where people have done fraud and you have to track back data that far.

25:49.400 --> 25:54.440
But at the same time though, like a lot of places will have server warehouses or backups

25:54.440 --> 25:59.840
or whatever. They'll pay a third party company to back up everything in like another, another

25:59.840 --> 26:05.280
branch somewhere. Like I know our company, we, uh, they have, I roll my eyes every time

26:05.280 --> 26:13.080
they mentioned something like this. They have a place in Arizona that's like a place that

26:13.080 --> 26:18.600
other companies send their data. It's like a, in case, you know, something catastrophic

26:18.600 --> 26:24.760
happens and the company is like incinerated, at least all this data is backed up in Arizona

26:24.760 --> 26:30.560
in like a mountains or something like that. A little crazy, but hey, you know what? If

26:30.560 --> 26:35.680
a company as small as ours is doing something like that, Sony should be storing it in like

26:35.680 --> 26:41.380
the bottom of a volcano and like the middle of like some sort of evil lair in the ocean

26:41.380 --> 26:45.520
or something or in the bottom of, you know, an iceberg in Antarctica or something. I don't

26:45.520 --> 26:49.760
know. Also, dark soccer, you worked for a bank, right? So for mortgage company owned

26:49.760 --> 26:54.960
by a bank, a financial institution needing that information for that long. I get that

26:54.960 --> 27:00.080
a way more than I do Sony needing that information. Sony is not a financial institution. I think

27:00.080 --> 27:05.520
having the information backed up on a separate server is one thing. Having it is still an

27:05.520 --> 27:13.240
active memory for lack of a better description. That's kind of dumb. I can see holding onto

27:13.240 --> 27:19.600
the information, especially for purposes of bookkeeping, accounting, you know, but it

27:19.600 --> 27:25.920
was how long, how old? Well, here's the thing they were saying. Seven is kinda, here's the

27:25.920 --> 27:33.640
thing they were saying though. Of the 12,700 cards stolen, 900 were still active. Oh, well,

27:33.640 --> 27:38.840
it's just 900 then. Well, that's why are we even making this an issue? Those 900 people

27:38.840 --> 27:45.800
can suck it. Wow. All right. So let's just pop in our chat room, but I give it a spread.

27:45.800 --> 27:49.780
This shines a little light on this saying, uh, I'm pretty sure they are going back two

27:49.780 --> 27:53.840
years or more at the porn place. We were only allowed to archive the last four digits and

27:53.840 --> 27:57.640
expiration date and dark soccer was right. It was in case we were ever subpoenaed or

27:57.640 --> 28:02.440
anything and had to look up legacy order history re sketchy use of a card. Like if it wasn't

28:02.440 --> 28:06.680
stolen and a relative was using it, but the whole card number was purged after a year,

28:06.680 --> 28:12.880
I think. Yeah, that's kind of the transaction history. I get that, but the card number and

28:12.880 --> 28:19.480
data itself, that is very weird. Tax audits was the only thing I can think of. Um, even

28:19.480 --> 28:24.680
then, doesn't your bank take, why did Sony need that? So bank having that, I get it.

28:24.680 --> 28:30.840
Sony having it, I don't. Yeah, I don't. There's a huge problem I have with that. Hence why

28:30.840 --> 28:35.080
we turn to Congress and what, why Congress is getting involved with all of this right

28:35.080 --> 28:39.020
now. And Sony actually responded to Congress this week. You might remember last week we

28:39.020 --> 28:43.160
talked to Congress was getting involved, writing a nice little letter to Sony going, uh, what

28:43.160 --> 28:46.380
the fuck is going on? Are you, did you put all these Americans informations at risk?

28:46.380 --> 28:51.300
You know, just basically in a nutshell there, um, cause her eyes and an open letter back

28:51.300 --> 28:55.520
to Congress detailing Sony's various principles and how they've been dealing with the PlayStation

28:55.520 --> 29:01.000
network outage and all the various leaks. Uh, it is on various blogs all over the place

29:01.000 --> 29:07.740
for you to take a look at. Uh, they also summarized it on the PlayStation blog. Uh, they had various

29:07.740 --> 29:12.960
principles that they worked with during this whole issue. Act with care and caution, provide

29:12.960 --> 29:17.200
relevant information to the public when it has been verified. Take responsibility for

29:17.200 --> 29:23.200
our obligations to our customers. Work with law enforcement authorities. Uh, also they've

29:23.200 --> 29:27.920
talked about the timeline for the attack. Uh, they said, quote, we discovered that the

29:27.920 --> 29:33.200
intruders had placed a file on one of our Sony online entertainment servers named anonymous

29:33.200 --> 29:38.880
with the words, we are, hold on. They hacked my computer too. Look, there is a text file

29:38.880 --> 29:43.440
right here. It says we are Legion. That's impossible. Only they could have done that.

29:43.440 --> 29:47.560
It's impossible that anybody else could create a text file that says we are Legion and they're

29:47.560 --> 29:52.520
named anonymous. How is this possible? How did they do this? I thought my network was

29:52.520 --> 30:01.360
secure. There was also a text. There's also a text file named Crayola in the system. Apparently

30:01.360 --> 30:06.520
with the names of 256 flavors of crayons. I don't know why they had that, but it was

30:06.520 --> 30:11.120
in the system. I have a comment on this. Yes, Dan, how are you Dan? Does anybody else find

30:11.120 --> 30:19.640
it ironic that our government is mad at Sony because when Sony overreacted to somebody

30:19.640 --> 30:25.320
hacking their system, the hackers came back to get them and it backfired on them, right?

30:25.320 --> 30:30.580
And we, we do that all the time. That's what we do. We're Americans. We're like that country

30:30.580 --> 30:37.440
stumbled their nose at us. Let's go get them. Five years later. Fuck. What were we thinking?

30:37.440 --> 30:42.680
Come on guys. Give Sony a break. They're dealing. But at the same time, you know, that's what

30:42.680 --> 30:52.720
they get. Fuckers. Well, it's just like, well, you know, I, I have blamed on this show an

30:52.720 --> 30:59.000
awful lot. The problem is Sony lies with the way they're being managed. They are a horribly

30:59.000 --> 31:06.160
managed company right now. Horribly managed company. And the only thing that is more horribly

31:06.160 --> 31:11.920
managed than Sony is the government. So this whole exchange really, like when I read about

31:11.920 --> 31:26.500
it, this is what I hear in my head. And it's, it's great cause they're like, Oh, we think

31:26.500 --> 31:31.000
anonymous did it because there was this text file. Yeah. Wow. That, that, well, that's,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.640
that's proof right there that somebody, you know, it couldn't have been any other hacker

31:35.640 --> 31:40.840
whatsoever that, you know, put that text file in there to, you know, maybe divert attention

31:40.840 --> 31:50.360
away from them and to anonymous. Or it could have been, you know, keep in mind you've got

31:50.360 --> 31:56.840
a group that's decentralized and leaderless pretty much. So you can't control it. Everybody

31:56.840 --> 32:00.360
who might be associated with it does. I've got more on that in just a moment. Let me,

32:00.360 --> 32:04.600
uh, let me get that here. By the way, Sony says they still have yet to identify the individual

32:04.600 --> 32:08.760
or individuals that are responsible for the breach. Of course not because, Oh my God,

32:08.760 --> 32:14.100
it would be the minute it is identified who did this. And if Sony in any way possible

32:14.100 --> 32:19.280
can tie it to anonymous, it's going to be like the headline on every fucking website

32:19.280 --> 32:25.480
out there. Like anonymous, not so anonymous anymore. Meet the face of anonymous. You know,

32:25.480 --> 32:30.160
it's whoever gets caught with this is going to get drugged through the proverbial street.

32:30.160 --> 32:34.520
It is retarded. I mean, cause once again, you're saying that this is a group with no

32:34.520 --> 32:39.560
real leadership. Okay. There are people that are leaders or whatever and you know, there

32:39.560 --> 32:43.360
are people that are acting on their own on this website or whatever. Well basically it's

32:43.360 --> 32:48.660
4chan. Okay. So let's just not even call it anonymous anymore. It's 4chan. Okay. And then

32:48.660 --> 32:54.680
on top of that, if, if you don't have a, if it's not really a group that has any sort

32:54.680 --> 32:59.580
of, you know, structure to their membership or anything that anybody can claim membership

32:59.580 --> 33:03.880
to it, then you can't even really go after the group. You have to say it's this person

33:03.880 --> 33:09.300
that did it because it's not anonymous because not all of them participated in it. It's this

33:09.300 --> 33:14.160
one dude that says he's an anonymous. Like if I said I'm in anonymous right now and I

33:14.160 --> 33:20.520
kicked Jamie or is she going to go sue anonymous because you know, no, I wouldn't bother suing

33:20.520 --> 33:25.840
you. I just punch you in the face. Dude, dark soccer is going to punch anonymous in the

33:25.840 --> 33:34.840
face. You know, make sure we poop in your soda or something. It's just, it's, it's dumb

33:34.840 --> 33:40.720
is what it is. All right. I need to get some more. Speaking of anonymous, uh, they of course

33:40.720 --> 33:47.780
have denied responsibility for this. Yes. Sorry. And I hate bringing up these guys,

33:47.780 --> 33:55.580
but um, you may remember back with certain people griefing said podcasts that were part

33:55.580 --> 34:04.280
of a certain forum. Yeah. So anonymous was griefing this podcast. That's how retarded

34:04.280 --> 34:12.320
Jamie go punch them in the face. So anyways, it's, it's just, all right, look, you can't

34:12.320 --> 34:16.800
claim that the group is behind it because there is no group. It's just people that say

34:16.800 --> 34:22.160
that they're part of this group. So you'll just find who's behind it. It's people, not

34:22.160 --> 34:26.680
a group. All right, look, speaking of anonymous, uh, they did send a statement to the guardian.

34:26.680 --> 34:30.540
I'm not, I don't, I mean, I just don't understand how it works. Who sent the statement to the

34:30.540 --> 34:34.400
guardian because I didn't think anyone was supposedly in charge, but I guess really there

34:34.400 --> 34:40.220
is like a council or something. So there's like, so there's gotta be some type of hierarchy

34:40.220 --> 34:44.680
and anonymous because who's sending the letter because otherwise Loki could just send a letter

34:44.680 --> 34:51.200
to the guardian thing. Anonymous is official statement is poop, poop, fart, fart, but who's

34:51.200 --> 35:00.360
to say that's not the official statement. Evil council, evil council.

35:00.360 --> 35:05.920
That's a power reference. Anyway, the statement said public support is not gained by stealing

35:05.920 --> 35:09.400
credit card info and personal identities. We are trying to fight criminal activities

35:09.400 --> 35:14.440
by corporations and governments, not steal credit cards. If a legitimate and honest investigation

35:14.440 --> 35:18.520
into the credit card is conducted, anonymous will not be found liable while we are in a

35:18.520 --> 35:24.760
distributed and decentralized group. Our leadership does not condone credit card theft. Poop,

35:24.760 --> 35:33.200
poop, fart. I mean, seriously, who's to say that, you know, since it's, but then apparently

35:33.200 --> 35:38.160
according to a different report in the financial times, two veteran members of anonymous that

35:38.160 --> 35:42.540
I guess the financial times knew, I guess they weren't that anonymous, but somehow they

35:42.540 --> 35:49.720
got in touch there saying that some element of that original attack was probably the likely

35:49.720 --> 35:55.960
reason. The word likely was involved. And then, uh, according to these veteran members

35:55.960 --> 35:59.960
quote, if you say you are anonymous and do something as anonymous, then anonymous did

35:59.960 --> 36:10.640
it. Well, regardless, whoever did this, I mean, whoever did this is going to be in a

36:10.640 --> 36:15.000
whole lot of trouble if they ever get found out. It's going to be public embarrassment.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.560
I mean, at this point, but yeah, if they do, I mean, you know, it's already pretty Sony

36:20.560 --> 36:27.040
systems are unhackable. You can't dare dare on their day of, they're prevented against

36:27.040 --> 36:34.600
all types of intrusions, right? You know why they can't find any way to hack the systems?

36:34.600 --> 36:41.200
Cause they did it with my mind. All this credit cards gone. All right, dark soccer. What do

36:41.200 --> 36:46.760
you know? And then I put that text file there so we'll never know it's me. Well, Sony has

36:46.760 --> 36:53.120
basically, um, because there's still a wallowing in their own poop like a retarded monkeys,

36:53.120 --> 36:58.440
they have decided that, oh, we could do something to help these people maybe. So they are partnering

36:58.440 --> 37:05.480
with Debics, D E B I X to give 12 months of identity theft protection for free. Um, also

37:05.480 --> 37:11.800
not just a 12 months, but also adding the time that the service was out to. Um, so there

37:11.800 --> 37:15.640
should be offers coming out over the next few days with a promotional code for the service

37:15.640 --> 37:22.800
and people will have until June 18th to register for it. Um, I'm wondering though, this is

37:22.800 --> 37:27.920
going to be some sort of, ooh, do we have to pay for a longer term if we get this as

37:27.920 --> 37:34.480
like a free, you know, it better be completely free, no strings attached. That's my thing.

37:34.480 --> 37:38.920
That basically is saying that what the all clear ID service is going to have a cyber

37:38.920 --> 37:43.440
monitoring and surveillance of the Internet to detect exposure of all clear ID plus customers

37:43.440 --> 37:50.320
personal information. Um, a million dollar, um, identity theft insurance policy per user

37:50.320 --> 37:54.160
to provide additional protection. In case of all clear, blah, blah, blah, becomes a

37:54.160 --> 37:59.520
victim of identity theft. So remember, hackers, you need to wait until till they sign up for

37:59.520 --> 38:05.960
it till June 18th, 2012 to do all the stealing of identities. So those bastards aren't covered

38:05.960 --> 38:10.440
at all. That'll suck it to him. What you do is you make, okay, hacker people make friends

38:10.440 --> 38:18.360
with your victim and then say, okay, I'll hack you and we'll split the money. Yeah,

38:18.360 --> 38:25.560
Jamie shame on you. It's just too little too late. Um, and on top of that, you know, identity

38:25.560 --> 38:30.200
protection services are really such, I mean this one says, Oh, we'll cover your legal

38:30.200 --> 38:34.080
costs and blah, blah, blah. But really all you have to do is go to your bank and your

38:34.080 --> 38:39.160
bank covers this shit. You cancel your cards, you know, unless somebody has gone out and

38:39.160 --> 38:46.480
done something wholly illegal, like shoot somebody in the face and then leaves your

38:46.480 --> 38:53.200
driver's license on them. You know, which I don't see anybody about to go do. Then that's,

38:53.200 --> 38:58.040
that's different. And no, don't use that as an idea. I'll leave a card that says anonymous

38:58.040 --> 39:01.720
on it when they shoot them in the face and then they'll think that they just right out.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.020
We are Legion in their blood. You spell it out with their intros. I think the intestines

39:05.020 --> 39:15.840
long enough for that girl. So, uh, you got problems. I do not have problems. I have solutions

39:15.840 --> 39:19.400
and I want to know what this is that you linked me. That's supposed to do with Europe. That

39:19.400 --> 39:23.400
isn't anything about Europe. Somebody made a mistake in our little show, roll thread

39:23.400 --> 39:28.000
and you got the, uh, wrong. Well, apparently they're trying to do the same thing for Europe.

39:28.000 --> 39:38.080
The end. And there you go. So can I read this comment from a chair real quick? Amiga seven

39:38.080 --> 39:43.840
seven seven in our chat room says like some people on the net say gaming needs a WikiLeaks.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.320
I don't know. In theory, that's kind of a neat idea, but I don't know if gaming could

39:47.320 --> 39:52.120
the gaming community could handle something as serious as WikiLeaks. Like gaming needs

39:52.120 --> 39:56.600
a Perez Hilton. That's what, that's what gaming needs. Something a little more. That's what

39:56.600 --> 40:03.840
the, um, our website should do. Draw cocks on people's faces. That would be great. Coconoses

40:03.840 --> 40:11.680
on Marcus Phoenix. Let's do it. Loki. Um, yeah, I'm not about to go draw cocks on people's

40:11.680 --> 40:17.280
faces unless I put anonymous below it and then you know, they'll think that they drew

40:17.280 --> 40:23.120
cocks on people's faces. Ah, yeah. Anyways. Uh, so the PlayStation network supposed to

40:23.120 --> 40:29.680
come up this week, but as you know, it's not up this week. What the hell? It's, uh, been

40:29.680 --> 40:34.760
delayed because apparently they need further testing. Uh, and says, obviously not coming

40:34.760 --> 40:43.400
back this week. And, uh, it says that, you know, uh, based on, you know, this is when

40:43.400 --> 40:48.160
we held the press conference in Japan last week, uh, based on what we knew, we expected

40:48.160 --> 40:52.520
to have services online within a week. We were unaware of the extent of the attack on

40:52.520 --> 40:58.200
Sony online, um, servers and we're taking this opportunity to conduct further testing

40:58.200 --> 41:04.880
of the incredibly complex system. I might add the incredibly complex and poorly guarded

41:04.880 --> 41:15.560
system. Um, yeah, so it's not coming back this week. Surprise, surprise. And, um, apparently

41:15.560 --> 41:20.920
there is some stuff that came out from, to be fair, Loki, I mean, if I'm understanding

41:20.920 --> 41:26.880
correctly what exactly Sony is having to do right now, they are basically having to rewrite

41:26.880 --> 41:33.160
the entire fucking PlayStation network in two weeks. A process that took months to begin

41:33.160 --> 41:37.080
with, right? Am I right? That's kind of what they're doing. They're talking about reconstructing

41:37.080 --> 41:42.400
the whole fucking thing from the ground up. See this? It's the tiniest violin playing

41:42.400 --> 41:48.960
it for them. I feel so bad for them that they had to create an entirely new database. If

41:48.960 --> 41:55.280
only they had known that their database were, um, you know, poorly updated and, uh, just

41:55.280 --> 42:02.000
not ready for any sort of hacker attack. Oh, but they did because I legitimately do feel

42:02.000 --> 42:07.400
sorry for everybody that's having to work plenty of overtime right now. Probably mandatory

42:07.400 --> 42:11.640
overtime trying to fix this situation when it's really not their fault. Well, it's somebody's

42:11.640 --> 42:14.840
fault. They made decisions and unfortunately that's the way it works. Yeah, but it's like

42:14.840 --> 42:18.880
the grunts are having to pay for the queen bees decision and that's very unfortunate.

42:18.880 --> 42:25.320
So I really like this situation will never get better and tell Howard Stringer comes

42:25.320 --> 42:32.240
down. You don't like it. You don't work there. That seems pretty simple to me. Anyways, so

42:32.240 --> 42:38.160
some information coming out of the house of representatives, energy and commerce subcommittee

42:38.160 --> 42:44.000
on the commerce, manufacturing and trade. Wow. That's a long title. Um, according to

42:44.000 --> 42:48.800
the breach and this is, I had to laugh at a little bit too because I think from what

42:48.800 --> 42:54.000
I heard that it's some guy saying that he read somewhere on a forum, this information,

42:54.000 --> 42:59.600
I hope that's not the case, but, uh, apparently they're seeing that Sony had learned several

42:59.600 --> 43:07.120
months ago that, um, apparently the PlayStation network was hosted on servers running very

43:07.120 --> 43:13.600
old versions of Apache software that were unpatched and had no firewall installed. No

43:13.600 --> 43:20.880
firewall. That's awesome. I think that was debunked. I think, uh, uh, some other internet

43:20.880 --> 43:26.000
thing looked into it and found that no, there's caches out there that prove that that isn't

43:26.000 --> 43:31.240
the case. Okay. So this is just a case of Congress kind of understanding something and

43:31.240 --> 43:39.160
further complicating the situation. Exactly. Well, like I even remember reading this and

43:39.160 --> 43:44.400
I had to, I had to find it cause I actually read part of maybe the transcript or something

43:44.400 --> 43:50.080
like that. They were, they were quoted. Yeah. I had read on a, on a Sony or read on a forum

43:50.080 --> 43:54.640
that this was, they literally said, I read this on a forum. You're taking a forum as

43:54.640 --> 44:03.240
fact. Awesome. Nothing wrong with that at all. Now, Sony, I read this on a forum and

44:03.240 --> 44:09.360
I understand you like mudkips. Can you explain to me, Sony, what is a mudkip? Hey, I read

44:09.360 --> 44:15.520
here on another forum fucking Nintendo. It totally told me where the WMDs were in Iraq.

44:15.520 --> 44:22.440
Where's WMDs there. This forum said so we need to go right now. Um, they would never

44:22.440 --> 44:28.320
be wrong. And then this is great. Apparently there is a rumored third attack planned for

44:28.320 --> 44:38.960
Sony. Um, so it says, and this is great. Let's, let's just read through this and laugh at

44:38.960 --> 44:43.920
the source. Okay. A group of hackers says that they're playing another wave of cyber

44:43.920 --> 44:52.160
attacks against Sony retaliation for its handling of the PlayStation network breach. Because

44:52.160 --> 44:59.240
you're mad about the way they're handling this situation. Your plan is to hack them

44:59.240 --> 45:06.600
again. Hey, listen, we're going to, we're going to hack you again. So we're in an observer.

45:06.600 --> 45:12.040
Wait, wait, hold on. This is great. This is where this is coming from. An observer of

45:12.040 --> 45:20.480
an internet relay chat channel used by hackers told Cena. So it's a guy in a chat room that

45:20.480 --> 45:38.880
witnessed random people talking. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm holding, I'm waiting.

45:38.880 --> 45:47.320
He doesn't yet. Loki. Oh my God. Oh my God. Report the news. Apparently I just hacked

45:47.320 --> 45:59.360
Sony. It said so in this internet relay channel. So, um, yes, that, that, that's really credible.

45:59.360 --> 46:06.080
That's about one step below forum posts. But, um, Hey, you know, I guess that that's, uh,

46:06.080 --> 46:13.000
that's fact. So, um, yeah. Should the plant attack and the tax succeed, it would be the

46:13.000 --> 46:17.280
latest blow in the series of devastating tech. That's right. Should this attack a seed? It

46:17.280 --> 46:26.360
would be another attack against Sony. Wow. That's great reporting. Uh, in our chat says

46:26.360 --> 46:34.840
I have a hankering to watch hackers now. Crash override. Zero. Cool. Angelina Jolie. That's

46:34.840 --> 46:40.320
what they should have put in there. They should have put all that stuff like hack the planet

46:40.320 --> 46:52.240
and all this crap from the hackers movie. That would have been hilarious. Ah, I can't.

46:52.240 --> 46:59.080
All right. All right. Yeah, that's it. We're, we're not going to, I don't. So what now?

46:59.080 --> 47:04.120
I mean, that was an exclusive article though. Can I say this though? Cause I read this on

47:04.120 --> 47:09.640
Facebook, so I know it's true. And, and you know, you commented on one of Salacious Pop's

47:09.640 --> 47:13.800
posts and you said, ah, gamers will forget this in a year. Will they really? I mean,

47:13.800 --> 47:17.040
now it's, I realize I say, I've said that on the show before and it's, it's usually

47:17.040 --> 47:20.880
pretty true. Like, you know, most people have pretty much forgiven Microsoft for the whole

47:20.880 --> 47:25.040
red ring of death thing at this point, you know, and a lot of folks have forgiven other

47:25.040 --> 47:29.240
gaming companies for their massive fuckups, but I mean, we're going on date 18 and this

47:29.240 --> 47:35.280
could be like literally a month before this is fixed. I mean, we might forget what happened,

47:35.280 --> 47:39.760
but will the developers who've now lost a month of sales forget what's happened? And

47:39.760 --> 47:46.360
we are getting dangerously close to E3 for Sony. I mean, E3 is less than awesome. Now

47:46.360 --> 47:51.880
imagine if PlayStation network is not up by the time that they all, that is awesome. That

47:51.880 --> 47:56.400
would be awesome. Granted, the system will probably not awesome for PlayStation or people,

47:56.400 --> 48:00.000
but awesome for the press conference. You've seen that GIF on the internet of Michael Jackson

48:00.000 --> 48:03.280
eating the popcorn from the thriller video. That's like all of us right now at the, at

48:03.280 --> 48:08.640
the press conference for Sony. If, if PlayStation network is not a hundred percent working now,

48:08.640 --> 48:12.000
I'm sure at least the multiplayer gaming and all that crap will be back and home will be

48:12.000 --> 48:16.040
up and all that. But if the store's not up, I'm saying, which is the hardest part, I think

48:16.040 --> 48:20.200
for them to fix, it's going to be interesting. Like the keynote is going to be really weird

48:20.200 --> 48:25.280
this year. It's going to be so weird. Like it's just going to be a train wreck, I think.

48:25.280 --> 48:28.880
Well, especially if they're going to be talking about like, you know, it's going to be, it's

48:28.880 --> 48:32.680
going to overshadow whatever they're showing. And there's some awesome, like the last guardian

48:32.680 --> 48:35.880
and shit. Like I want to know more about that. And there's some pretty exciting shit that's

48:35.880 --> 48:39.480
supposed to be coming out for PlayStation, especially when they're talking about like,

48:39.480 --> 48:44.960
you know, the, in the next PlayStation portable system or whatever, that's going to have like

48:44.960 --> 48:49.200
a lot of this, you know, storefront stuff built into it. We'd love to show you it, but

48:49.200 --> 49:02.080
uh, you know, hackers and it's down. Yeah, um, I, I, uh, I'm, I'm curious to see how

49:02.080 --> 49:05.620
many times and we should have a betting pool on this. Actually, you know what? I have the

49:05.620 --> 49:09.440
week off of work. What I would love to do is, yeah, I do. So what we need to do, we

49:09.440 --> 49:14.580
need to have a Sony press conference drinking game and we each need to pick a word. And

49:14.580 --> 49:17.440
every time we hear that word, we're going to take a shot and my word is going to be

49:17.440 --> 49:24.440
secure. So every time we hear the word secure at the PlayStation, E3 press conference, I'm

49:24.440 --> 49:29.360
going to take a shot and I'm going to be hacker. I'm going to put like, you know, even odds

49:29.360 --> 49:36.800
that I will end up in the hospital at the end of the PlayStation press conference.

49:36.800 --> 49:42.720
I pick hacker. Am I trying to kill myself in this or not? I mean, what's, what's what

49:42.720 --> 49:46.420
type of, you're trying to kill yourself, trying to kill myself. So what word would you pick

49:46.420 --> 49:57.720
to make yourself end up in the hospital? PlayStation. No, you can't pick that dummy. You never said

49:57.720 --> 50:07.280
I couldn't find Sony either. And you can't pick NGP or whatever. You're no fun. Oh God,

50:07.280 --> 50:15.000
I hate you. All right. Oh, and then of course, finally, uh, Sony there, this is great. There

50:15.000 --> 50:23.680
apparently, now I don't know if I should really trust this since it's also from CNET the website

50:23.680 --> 50:29.040
that gets their information from people that saw internet relay chats. Um, but apparently

50:29.040 --> 50:33.400
they're saying that Sony is waiting in weather to offer a reward for the information on the

50:33.400 --> 50:38.600
hackers behind the massive network outage. Um, so they're looking, they're going to put

50:38.600 --> 50:43.760
out a reward. It's going to be all Milt Gibson, you know, here's a million dollars. Find them.

50:43.760 --> 50:56.960
Give me back my son. Yes, that's exactly what's going to happen. I need you to find these

50:56.960 --> 51:09.280
and give me back my son. Uh, also I guess, uh, Sony's denied allegations made in the

51:09.280 --> 51:14.460
congressional testimony on Thursday that the servers were not running under the most current

51:14.460 --> 51:19.600
security update. Of course, this is the previous network for Sony network entertainment, international

51:19.600 --> 51:23.680
and Sony online entertainment use servers that were patched and updated recently and

51:23.680 --> 51:30.320
had multiple security measures in place, including firewalls, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

51:30.320 --> 51:37.720
Um, well, you know what, here's what I have to say about that. It didn't do damn good.

51:37.720 --> 51:43.360
It did it. You know, whether you had firewalls up or no firewalls, they still got in. So

51:43.360 --> 51:49.720
I don't know, is that even more pathetic that they were updated and ready to go? I mean,

51:49.720 --> 51:54.720
at least if they weren't updated, you know, I might say, okay, that's how they got in.

51:54.720 --> 51:59.060
But since they were, then how am I going to trust that your brand new network or whatever

51:59.060 --> 52:02.360
that you're rebuilding from the ground up is going to be any different than this one

52:02.360 --> 52:07.760
since you're, you know, superb security was no match for the hackers.

52:07.760 --> 52:11.960
Give me back my son!

52:11.960 --> 52:12.960
Ah, yes.

52:12.960 --> 52:23.400
Um, actually, I think the reward's a pretty good idea. I think, um, I think the reward,

52:23.400 --> 52:27.960
you know, what better way to get all these guys to turn on each other than put a million

52:27.960 --> 52:32.560
dollars on the line, right? It's actually a pretty smart move on Sony's part if they

52:32.560 --> 52:39.760
do it, if they do it, but we'll see. Uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm so looking forward to the E3

52:39.760 --> 52:42.520
press conference, but anyway, I don't know what else to say about the situation at this

52:42.520 --> 52:47.040
point. I feel like there's just, you just like, do you remember the Ricky Lake talk

52:47.040 --> 52:51.960
show in the 1990s? Do you remember Ricky Lake? Go Ricky. Do you remember Ricky Lake? Do you

52:51.960 --> 52:55.240
remember how like whenever her guests would just get like totally out of control on the

52:55.240 --> 52:58.520
stage, she'd just kind of be standing there with a microphone or jaws just all drop. Like

52:58.520 --> 53:03.580
I, like that's me right now. I'm out of my element. Exactly. Like I'm just kind of looking

53:03.580 --> 53:08.720
at the stage at all these people fighting and Sony and anonymous and the Congress and

53:08.720 --> 53:13.640
I'm just looking and I'm just, my mouth just dropped and I'm shaking my head. That's all

53:13.640 --> 53:19.560
I've got left to say on the situation.

53:19.560 --> 53:23.680
So let's talk about something else. Dark Sakura. Yes. Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. I have one of

53:23.680 --> 53:27.960
the things. Sorry. My bad. Whatever it is. It's PlayStation related, but it's not about

53:27.960 --> 53:33.640
the hack. Uh, it has to do with PlayStation rewards. Remember this? Well, you may not

53:33.640 --> 53:39.600
because it never really happened, but there was a beta program that ended on March 31st

53:39.600 --> 53:47.000
and an exclusive t-shirt was sent to the beta testers who got to one of the tiers in this

53:47.000 --> 53:52.600
PlayStation rewards loyalty program. And they were sent a thank you card saying, wear it

53:52.600 --> 53:59.620
proud. And they, yes, they got a t-shirt from this. Sony literally sent these people a t-shirt

53:59.620 --> 54:05.120
that pretty much says I participated in a PlayStation beta and all I got was this lousy

54:05.120 --> 54:06.120
t-shirt.

54:06.120 --> 54:07.120
That's awesome.

54:07.120 --> 54:15.200
Okay. Now Dark Sakura, sorry.

54:15.200 --> 54:21.960
Sony you suck. How about something free? Something happy and free and not at all related to Sony.

54:21.960 --> 54:29.560
There is a Thor game. It's a 16 bit browser based platformer and it is called, uh, Thor

54:29.560 --> 54:36.040
bring the thunder. And, uh, it's basically like Thor, but done Mega Man style. So it

54:36.040 --> 54:47.160
looks pretty neat. I think I would want that. And, uh, there actually is a, uh, DS version

54:47.160 --> 54:50.680
either out or to be out. This is, yeah, I said May 3rd.

54:50.680 --> 54:55.280
I was going to cue my wine. If this is just a 16 bit game, why couldn't like virtual console

54:55.280 --> 54:59.680
be used for something like this? But no, that's too, that's too smart. That's that's that

54:59.680 --> 55:03.680
would be something new and innovative. I'm sorry. But yeah, I like the idea of at least

55:03.680 --> 55:10.680
a free game able to play online that has the rainbow road. I haven't seen the new movie

55:10.680 --> 55:19.560
yet. Okay. I hear it's not bad in the comics. Well, I'll go ahead and I'll use ultimate.

55:19.560 --> 55:25.400
He summons a freaking rainbow that brings us guardian heroes to earth. He brings the

55:25.400 --> 55:33.900
mightiest warriors in the, in all of reality on the rainbow road to kick ass for Norse

55:33.900 --> 55:41.960
justice. And I always like, that's very Norse and his level in, um, Marvel versus Capcom

55:41.960 --> 55:46.520
three has rainbow road in the background. You know, I think he's really Mario. You know

55:46.520 --> 55:52.280
what my favorite part of the Thor movie is though? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That wasn't

55:52.280 --> 55:55.520
Thor at all. Actually. I've actually seen part of it, but just for a cameo that makes

55:55.520 --> 56:00.240
me super excited. Oh, the whole Avengers tie in thing or something else. But one of my

56:00.240 --> 56:07.120
favorite Avengers characters popped up. Okay. Makes me super happy. There you go. All right,

56:07.120 --> 56:13.440
moving on. Let's try to give you a clue. It's it's Mel Gibson. All right, let's travel the

56:13.440 --> 56:17.320
world and see what games are coming out soon in a gaming store near you and what games

56:17.320 --> 56:23.520
you can play to help take your mind off of the, uh, Benny Hill theme song. Uh, this week

56:23.520 --> 56:29.760
we've got some, uh, actually a pretty decent selection of titles Lego Pirates of the Caribbean

56:29.760 --> 56:33.800
because you know, there's a new Pirates movie and there are Lego Pirates of the Caribbean

56:33.800 --> 56:38.560
toys. So it only makes sense that there's Lego Pirates of the Caribbean game. And that's

56:38.560 --> 56:44.720
out on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60. We and a DS. There is some online co-op play

56:44.720 --> 56:47.620
except if you're on the PlayStation or cause you can't play on the PlayStation network

56:47.620 --> 56:55.580
right now. A break coming out on a PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 and a PC this week. Also

56:55.580 --> 56:59.560
with online co-op and multiplayer except on the PlayStation three because the PlayStation

56:59.560 --> 57:06.720
network is down now. All right, I'll stop. Um, Yu-Gi-Oh fifties world championship 2011

57:06.720 --> 57:16.920
from Konami on Nintendo DS. Um, the first Templar from Calypso on Xbox three 60 and

57:16.920 --> 57:22.760
uh, Oh, I guess Lego Pirates was on PSP. How did I forget that? Virtua tennis four on a

57:22.760 --> 57:33.240
PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 and the Wii and a dream trigger finally coming out on

57:33.240 --> 57:37.520
the three DS. Actually though, now that I've seen gameplay of it, I am not picking that

57:37.520 --> 57:42.840
game up. What's dream trigger all about? It was a music, um, kind of shoot him up game.

57:42.840 --> 57:47.560
Um, but it was really weird looking. It's, I thought it was going to be kinda like rez,

57:47.560 --> 57:53.020
but it's not. It's like, um, you have to tap the screen on the bottom and it creates like

57:53.020 --> 57:57.800
a little radar thing and you see enemies. You have to go, Hey, not my thing. Um, if

57:57.800 --> 58:01.780
it was like rez. Well, I'm taking a peek at a little, uh, pretty bad ass trailer here

58:01.780 --> 58:07.080
that's on the YouTube. As you can see here, there are some shut up. I don't want to hear

58:07.080 --> 58:12.800
this guy. Last but not least, MX versus ATV alive coming out, um, from THQ on PlayStation

58:12.800 --> 58:17.400
three and Xbox three 60. And of course this is one of the first games that THQ is experimenting

58:17.400 --> 58:22.120
with their lower price games. So it's only $40 retail and they're going to have a download

58:22.120 --> 58:25.940
content every two weeks. So you know, Hey, if you want to kind of support that type of

58:25.940 --> 58:31.800
thing and try to maybe get the prices of games down, then that'd be the way to go. So, um,

58:31.800 --> 58:35.800
and I hear it's supposed to be pretty good and that's it for this week. See, I'm looking

58:35.800 --> 58:40.640
at, I found a working where some dude isn't talking over it. Hold on. I really hate sometimes

58:40.640 --> 58:44.440
that literally anyone can upload things to YouTube because I hate the people that just

58:44.440 --> 58:47.560
take like someone else's YouTube and then do their own thing over it. Like, Oh, you

58:47.560 --> 58:56.280
heard taste me. Hold on. Okay. So, uh, dream trigger. The next generation of handheld shooters

58:56.280 --> 59:06.520
is here. Mind warping 3D. Over 50 levels. Collectible trophies in multiplayer. Wait,

59:06.520 --> 59:13.720
trophies on a 3DS game. Hold on. It seems like on the bottom screen, you have to tap

59:13.720 --> 59:19.080
it and you see where the enemies are on the top screen and then you have to shoot them.

59:19.080 --> 59:25.920
Weird. I mean, it might be cool, but it's just, you know, I've already gotten three

59:25.920 --> 59:30.960
3DS games that I don't play and so I don't really need to add a fourth to it. So, you

59:30.960 --> 59:37.120
know, I'll just, I'll wait until, you know, I'll tell you what D3, you know, cause they're

59:37.120 --> 59:40.720
the publisher of that game. You really want me to get the, you know, play a game on the

59:40.720 --> 59:47.680
3DS. You'll portal over earth defense for us cause that would be awesome. At least bring

59:47.680 --> 59:53.760
the PSP version of her. You know what? I'll get my PSP working again for that. All right,

59:53.760 --> 59:57.720
let's travel to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates. This week on the Xbox 360 major

59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.520
league baseball 2K11 comes out on May 12th. I should point this out. Portal two is out

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.640
next week and I wonder if that's a localization of the game. Like if they've actually redone

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.560
the voice acting and so forth. I don't know. It's in a lot of languages. Let me put it

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.520
that way. Okay, well maybe, maybe it's just the same version we have here. It's just finally

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.320
getting its Japanese release. I don't know, but I just, I wonder what GLaDOS sounds like

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.560
in Japanese. That's all. That's all I want to know, but that's next week. To give her

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:33.720
like an old, you know, Japanese man voice or whatever. On the PlayStation 3 major league

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:41.800
baseball 2K11 is out there as well as Suzumiya Harui no Suyasu comes out this week. It's

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:48.040
Haruhi. It's the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oh yeah, this is the same anime manga universe.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:54.880
So this is a game coming out on PS3 this week. A whole game about that series. There's also

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.760
a box edition, a special box edition on that if you want to get that if you're a big fan

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:04.760
of the anime. On the Nintendo Wii, nothing. On the 3DS, Steel Diver is out this week in

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.520
Japan. Of course that was a launch game for us here, but they're just now getting that

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:19.840
in Japan. And lastly on the PSP, Planetarian Shisana Hoshi no Yume. That's a charity edition.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.560
I'm not sure what that means. If that's a price reduction or something where the money

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.520
goes to charity. I don't have any translation on this, but it does look like the game is

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:38.640
kind of one of those like cyber anime space robot things. And also another version of

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.000
Suzumiya Harui is coming out there on the PSP as well. And lastly, Makai Senki Disgaea

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.920
2 Portable, of course Disgaea 2. Getting a price reduction this week on the PSP in Japan

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.800
and moves into the best series. There you go. There's your Japanese releases. How about

01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.060
the UK? We do have a few things for the UK. Let me look at my calendar because it's going

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:06.240
to be another week. Oh finals week. Shoot me. Okay. We have on the ninth, Hydrophobia

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:16.080
Prophecy and on the 11th, Alads Online. And then on the 13th, we've got a few things.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:23.320
We have Brink, Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, and that's it. Alright. Just a few more stories

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:30.280
for you guys. Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week. But first. Yes.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:38.440
So apparently though, I kind of think I know what this is. Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:46.720
is working on a core Kinect shooter game. And you know, there's been rumors for a while

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:52.320
now that they're going to be doing a Kinect Halo game. That's probably this. They're saying

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.080
that the studio's mission is to push the limits of the proven and unexplored game development

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:03.400
and show the world what's possible with Microsoft game consoles. That's pretty generic sounding.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:10.120
But if I were to bet money, I would say it's probably going to be a Kinect Halo game. You

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.880
think? Yeah. Although. There were the rumors before about that anyway, so. It would be

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:22.760
cool if it was something original. Or you know, they want to be really cool. Not necessarily

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:29.280
I'd want a Kinect version of this, but Timesplitters isn't getting a lot of love lately. I really

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:37.800
love a new Timesplitters game. Just saying. Alright. One other story for you guys. This

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.040
is another big rumor that's popped up this week, and a lot of people kind of ignored

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.640
it because of everything that's going on with the Playstation. And honestly, this is probably

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.880
something that deserved to be ignored. But apparently, development kits for a brand new

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.920
Microsoft consoles were in the offices of one of EA Studios. This is according to a

01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.480
source. They don't work for EA or Microsoft, but they did say that it came in a PC shell

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:06.640
and it was shipped to EA last month. I guess there's been rumors already about Xbox 360

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.800
dev kits, and this was set to sort of dispel that rumor or what have you. I don't know.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.320
So of course, people are now speculating, is Microsoft set to reveal a new console at

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.720
E3? Well, EA's director of corporate communications came out and said in a statement to IGN that

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:31.880
that story was, quote, a total fabrication. It is 100% not true. And, you know, I absolutely

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.840
no way is there a Microsoft console being shown at E3 this year. I would bet a large

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.480
sum of money on that. Why? Because Kinect has not lived out its full potential yet.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.120
Microsoft's invested a lot in Kinect. Kinect is still, what's that record? It has the best

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.680
selling electronic gadget like ever, or fastest selling, I think, electronic gadget ever,

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:55.020
like more so than the iPhone. It's been crazy popular for them, but yet that hasn't really

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.800
reached his full potential. And they're on a 10 year console cycle. They've been stressing

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.700
that, and that's the whole plan with the Kinect anyway. Yeah, but Nintendo got away with not

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.720
doing that. But of course, Nintendo never said it was going to be a 10 year cycle for

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:10.320
them. Yeah, they never did. So, you know, whatever. But I just, no way are you going

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:17.100
to see a new, I mean, of course you might see maybe a redesigned 360 or a 360 with Kinect

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.760
built in. I don't know, you might see something like that, but I doubt it. I think it's going

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:26.200
to be just more Kinect support, and now it's not going to be so much about the dance games,

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.840
the biggest loser workout games, and those things. Now you're going to see the next wave

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:37.120
of quote unquote hardcore Kinect games, such as this rumored Halo reimagining that's going

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.240
to be done with Kinect. I think that's what E3 is all about this year. Now how do we take

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.680
Kinect to the next, like how do we make Kinect not so gimmicky? Because you haven't seen

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.960
just make it not gimmicky. I mean, that's it. I mean, what you need to do is, yeah,

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.700
you realize that you can do just because you can do something with the hardware doesn't

01:05:54.700 --> 01:06:01.440
mean you should do something with the hardware. Like I don't before, you know, head tracking.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:06.740
That's all you need to like for I don't understand why that's not even available for most first

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:11.360
person shooters nowadays is just have that support in there. OK, it does a little bit

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.680
of head tracking if you want to. That's it. That's all you have to add. I mean, if you

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.600
want to make it so you can throw a grenade by swinging your arms and cool, but it's not

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.720
really necessary because it takes a lot more time to swing my arm in a grenade motion than

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:32.600
it would to push a button. Yeah, so yeah, I just, you know, I think it's going to be

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.300
all about maybe this head tracking or whatever else technologies are going to put in future

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:41.840
games. That's what you're going to see at E3 this year. And of course, Dance Central 2,

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.040
you know, and sequels to the popular wave of first titles. But really, what Kinect releases

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:52.840
have we seen since Christmas until now? Very, very little. I mean, especially that's not

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.760
budget knockoff titles. Now granted, Child of Eden is kind of your lone standout point.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.240
But that's not a Kinect only game. That's a game that has Kinect support. That's OK.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.160
I still would consider that a Kinect title. OK, well, since Christmas, here's what we've

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:15.000
had. We've had Dance Paradise, which was a terrible dancing game from THQ. We had the

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.360
Michael Jackson Experience, which was kind of like Just Dance and a karaoke game. We've

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:27.240
had Fantastic Pets, which was a THQ pet sim game that, you know, it's kind of dumb. And

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:32.280
every game you've named so far is a derivative of one of the Christmas games. We've had...

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:39.480
We've got two Dance Centrals and Kinectimals. I'm trying to think what else we've had. Kung

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:49.800
Fu Panda 2, that's going to be a Kinect game. Michael Phelps, Push the Limit, that's coming

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.480
out in June. Whoopee. It's a swimming game. Nothing, nothing, I mean, you're stretching

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.280
to think of things. I mean, there's nothing that just jumps out at you as like an OMG

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:04.120
must own title. Right? I mean, all these are just little flashes in the pan because there's

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.620
nothing else on Kinect right now and people are hoping that they'll buy this crazy shit.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.320
You know, people that crave new dance games are going to buy this Dance Paradise or what

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.320
have you. Dance Paradise is terrible. Don't buy Dance Paradise. How does it work? Dance

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.640
Paradise, it has your avatars in it, for one. So that's how you know that they're not taking

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:31.680
the damn thing seriously. Two, it's basically, it's got this interface that looks terrible.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.920
You're standing, these kind of outlines of a person are kind of sliding towards you down

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.760
this. Kind of think of it like that Hole in the Wall show or something like that where

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:48.400
you have to move, make a certain gesture or something like that. Isn't that kind of how

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:54.520
Dance Masters works too? Sort of. But Dance Masters is less, you don't really know what's

01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:04.680
coming up. I don't know. It's an interesting idea, but it's really way too Japanese-skewed

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:12.440
Dance Masters, that's for sure. But, yeah, there's not a lot out there. People are looking

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.160
for stuff. It's just, sadly, Michael Jackson Experience is actually probably the best title

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:26.080
out of the bunch so far. Because, I mean, it's got Just Dance as the core to it, because

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:32.480
that's basically what the game's built off of. But, I mean, I'd wait for chat. Some people

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.400
in chat are kind of knocking on it, actually. Kaijuto says, Michael Jackson Inexperience,

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.720
I call it, DDR dollar bill. I was pissed at the experience, not from the dance moves,

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.640
but from being forced, quote unquote, to sing. Those comments from our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:52.720
How can you be forced to sing? The Kinect has a microphone in it. That does suck. Alright.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.160
You should be able to turn that off. Going back to the original story, though, about

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.860
the whole dev kit, actually, you know what's funny? I don't doubt that there actually is

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.720
a dev kit already at EA. I mean, if they are going to announce something next year, which

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:09.520
I'd see is a lot more viable, or maybe the year after, I mean, EA is one of the big,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.360
EA and Activision is probably your two biggest publishers, probably have to already be thinking

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.820
about what launch titles they want to make for it. These games don't take two seconds

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:25.480
to develop. They're going to take some time. So, I actually don't doubt that they're there.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.480
Of course these systems are already under development. You know, I bet EA has a pretty

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.920
good idea what to expect, but you're not going to see it this year. Well, of course not,

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:38.660
because, I mean, if anything, these are like alpha kits or something like that, because,

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:45.000
you know, let's say that they're sticking to the 10-year console cycle, okay? Well,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.600
the 360 was out in 05, and, I mean, the way prices are coming down on all electronic stuff,

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.480
you know, God knows what technology is going to be in five years, or four years, I guess.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.760
Almost five years. I mean, that stuff comes down in price so much, I mean, if they're

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.640
like building it off of specs right now, like say, okay, we're going to have a gig of RAM

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.760
in there or something like that, well, five years, you might be able to afford 16 gigs

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.640
of RAM for the price of that. Honestly, though, a lot of this depends on how much Nintendo

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.380
ups the Ani with what they're doing, because if they are hugely successful and they've

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.960
upped the Ani past the specs that 360 and PlayStation 3 has, it's going to force the

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.640
other two to work faster. Yeah, but I don't know if that's even going to be a big deal.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.420
I mean, they're going to have a little bit of an advantage of being first out there,

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:34.080
but it's all about how they grasp and use it, but if they're just going to be like,

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.080
well, we're out here first, so we're just going to kick on back, because we don't have

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.960
to worry about competition. But here's the thing, though, they've got to be way ahead

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:50.000
of the game, because if it's just making it just a hair better than PlayStation 3 or 360,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.600
it's all going to be gameplay then, and if they can't bring that to the table, then eh.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.800
But I don't think gameplay's a problem for them, because before, they've all focused

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:08.120
on gameplay, and graphics have kind of taken a back seat, so if they bring all the visuals

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.840
and audio and stuff up to snuff, then they have a pretty good system there. But they

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.920
also can't play their games that they've been playing recently, where it's just like, oh,

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.640
let's re-release this. Oh, let's make the graphics on this slightly better and re-release

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.840
it again. Oh, hey, here's another game that's just like this other game. Oh, hey, look,

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:34.480
it's another Animal Crossing with the exact same stuff in it. Oh, we'll see, we'll see.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.920
Alright, let's move on, we've got to get to the classic game of the week. Every week here

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.280
on Orange Launch Radio, DarkSakura takes a stroll to the classic gaming vault and digs

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.240
in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.540
You know, there's no network, none of your newfangled networks right now to play things

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:57.560
on anyway. Except XBox Live. So you should go back and revisit this classic game. Dark

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:03.680
Sakura, what is the classic game of the week? The classic game of the week is Phantasmagoria.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:10.600
Which was a weird ass game. Let's do some clips here if I can get to the point. I picked

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:17.560
one that like had some music, but then it went right into more talking. Anyway, Phantasmagoria

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:25.960
was on seven CD-ROMs for the PC and it was released in 1995, which was when I first played

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:31.920
it. I was my second year, no, my first full year of college. So it was, it took a lot

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.960
of time. I should have been studying. But anyway, it was one of the interactive movie

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.240
type games right in the height of the whole deal. And it used a live actress who her name

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.360
was a Victoria Morsell, which does sound kind of like a porn name, doesn't it? Miss Morsell,

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.920
will you please bend over for the camera? It makes me think of dark shadows. My name

01:13:52.920 --> 01:14:00.200
is Victoria Winters. At any rate, like I said, it was on seven CD's because it was a lot

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:06.680
of video, a ton of video. And actually most of it was filmed in front of a blue screen.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:13.160
There was something like several hundred different actions that the actress who is the main character

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.240
in the show, well not in the show, in the game, had to do, you know, like walking to

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.920
a night and picking something up, doing something. And also it had 550 pages of a script, which

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:30.000
is about four times the size of a regular movie script and an additional hundred pages

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.920
of storyboards for the 800 scenes in the game. It took four months of filming and 200 people

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.280
were involved in the productions. That's also including, that's actually not including,

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:46.000
sorry, the 135 people who were in the Gregorian choir for part of the music. And the last

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:54.080
scene took a week to film. But anyway, it was developed by Roberta Williams, who is,

01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:00.680
she's actually behind King's Quest. And it was one of the goriest and most violent games

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.080
to come out in its time. I mean, it's got an M rating now. It had... Can I look at some

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.520
of these death scene YouTubes? I want to see how gory this game is. Okay. Let's see here.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:22.200
I want to see some of this here. Let's put it up. Yep. So she's walking in front of like

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.760
this mirror that's doing a little swirly gas thing.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:40.760
Can I give you a special feast, Regina? Oh, that's one of the murders.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:16:01.120
Ew, he's like shoving all these organs in this chick's mouth and like forcing her to

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:07.840
eat them. This game's nasty. Basically the story, the main character is Adrian and her

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.160
husband, Gordon. And she's a paperback writer and he is a photographer. So they buy this

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:23.400
mansion that's owned by a 19th century magician named Zoltan Carnavash. And so basically through

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:29.880
the course of the thing, she accidentally releases this demon that had possessed basically

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:40.080
Carno, the illusionist, and it possesses her husband. So he goes on this big spree of being

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.920
abusive. He rapes her in one scene and then he gets more and more possessed and starts

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:51.440
killing people. And it turns out that this guy killed five of his wives. He had five

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:57.520
wives and he killed them based on how they were in life. Like one of them was into gardening

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.320
so he suffocated her with mulch and stabbed her with gardening tools. There was another

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.040
one who was an alcoholic so he shoved her in the eye with a wine bottle. There was a

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:11.560
talkative one so he gagged her and then broke her neck. And then this one... Oh my God.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:18.400
Oh my God, this demon just put his hands in the chick's eyes and pulled her face in half.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.960
This game's nasty. But she liked food and so he force fed her animal entrails until

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:32.200
she took to death. So his last wife realizes that he's a murderer so she and her lover

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.560
try to kill him except he comes back and kills them but they kill him again and then they

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:49.560
all die. So I don't know. Anyway, it's a lot of gore, a lot of really violent themes and

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:58.880
pretty, pretty hardcore stuff. And you're sick if you like this. This is so gross, Jamie.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:07.280
This is a gross game. The reason why I'm bringing it up is because at that time it was really

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:17.400
novel for its time. It was really pushing the envelope. Fucked up? How about fucked

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:23.000
up? No, that's a good word. It was really fucked up. But for when it came out in 95

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.300
there weren't too many other games. I mean, basically you had Myst. It really did kind

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:34.280
of push the envelope and I think it's one of... I'd have to put it in... Grand Theft

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:42.560
Auto is nothing compared to that. Grand Theft Auto is my little pony. It's an angel food

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.280
cake made with whipped cream. I mean... I agree with Dungeon Buster in the chat room.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.160
Fair to believe that King's Quest Williams did this. Clearly she had a dark side after

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.880
all those games about fucking fairytales. She's like, I can't take it anymore, gore!

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.760
More blood! More blood! Well, it also did get a sequel in 96 called Phantasmagoria,

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:10.000
a Puzzle of Flesh. Great name, huh? And you know, this actually came out in Japan for

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.920
the sake of Saturn. And it was completely re-dubbed in Japanese. It came out in 8 CDs.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.640
And it was released by Outtrigger in 97 and it was just called Phantasm there. And Roberta

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:31.040
Williams was asked by Sierra to do a third game, but nothing happened. And she actually

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:37.960
said that Phantasmagoria is the game most representative of her game design career.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:44.360
And there was a box set of both called Phantasmagoria Stage Fright in 1995. And actually it just

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:51.440
got re-released by Good Old Games in February last year as a digital download. I've actually

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:55.120
been totally considering because... So yeah, if you want to, if you want, if you, if you're

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.840
a sick person, you want to see this sick game, you can go... Oh, that's the final... Check

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.600
it out. Scene 2. Oh, this is like OMG Spoilers? Oh yeah, she, she... It was just labeled as

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:17.920
another death scene. Oh no. Uh oh. Oh my God! Gross! That's if you fail that. That blade

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:24.760
chopped her head in half. Yeah, but she uses it to kill him instead in the actual ending.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:32.500
Sick people. It's, it's a really, really violent, bloody, gory game. But like I said, it was

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:38.840
really one that pushed the envelope in those days. A lot went into it. And for what it

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:44.440
is, it's a pretty good game. So now I wouldn't say it's too hard of a game. I mean with the

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:49.360
puzzles, but it was pretty good. I remember playing it when I was a lot younger and I'm

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.840
really glad I wasn't very good at it because I never got to any of this stuff. I remember

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.840
playing the game. I borrowed it from my friend, but I was like, I don't get this. I can't

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:01.800
play this. So I never got to any of like the really gory stuff. So I'm kind of glad because

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:11.480
this is sick. Yeah. Pornography. But it, it needed to be mentioned. All right. It is,

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:16.320
it is one of those classics. All right. Uh, that's going to do it for a part eight of

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.800
our show, but don't go anywhere guys. We're going to be right back with plenty more of

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.600
orange lounge radio. We got more stuff coming up in part B. We're gonna talk a little bit

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:28.720
about some of the pre E3 stuff that's going on. Uh, some news about Nintendo as well.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.120
Lots of stuff, a little bit more. Wow. Cause the Warcraft did something important this

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.800
week. We want to share, uh, the mailbag as well. FUs of the week, your calls and tonight

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.680
a list list. So we'll take the topic. We'll get back with part B right here with more

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:54.240
of orange lounge radio. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio. We are live with episode

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.640
number 412. We're coming into part B. We've of course talked quite a bit about the whole

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.960
PlayStation debacle in part A. Uh, we're going to have a little fun with it here in part

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.640
B tonight. We're going to do some rapid fire news, some Twitter topics. You want to get

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.520
those in real quick and then a little later on we're going to get into tonight's list

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.080
list, which of course we have to poke fun at what's going on with PlayStation network

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:21.760
thing. PlayStation network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. So we'll

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.280
uh, be playing that game in just a little while. We'll tell you a little more about

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.480
listless and how that works if you've never heard it before. Uh, first we want to get

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.460
back into the show. Uh, I want to do some quick plugs though for the other projects

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:39.640
that we work on dark soccer. It's comic insanity and it's back. We recorded today. Yay. And

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:50.000
um, we, uh, go, uh, I'm stuck at promos today. We are on infamous.net and F A M O U S dot

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.640
net and you can download us every Tuesday where we talk about comic books and whether

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:04.640
or not we care about them and other geek worthy news. Awesome. It's me and Marin Marvel and

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.880
Dan shadow and we're awesome. Um, I want to also give a plug for my show. It's called

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.280
Horde House, the best little Horde house in Azeroth and it's about all things were the

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.320
Warcraft. So if the Warcraft chat earlier in this show just wasn't enough for you, there's

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.680
plenty more that happens with myself and extra for an extra for is very, very explicit. He's

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.600
more explicit than phantasmagoria, but with Dick jokes instead of blood. Extra for is

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:33.160
the guy who originated the term bleached asshole. Yes. Well, I don't know if he originated that.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.360
I believe a stripper somewhere originated that, but he made it famous. Exactly. A horde

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:43.760
house.com H O R D E H O U S E dot com. A couple other plugs I was asked to give here. Rama

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.920
said, please plug anime jam session. And I said, sure. Visit our friends at anime jam

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:54.240
session. You visit their website, anime jam session.com. Anime video games, cons, cosplay,

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.120
everything in between. Just throw it all in a blender and there you go. Anime jam session.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.000
Although it, it sounds a lot better. Trust me, it's, it's actually pretty cool. So check

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.200
that out. They've got a fun little show there. Also, um, my buddy say joined chat and one

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:11.280
of the big things he works on every year is OOM loud, OOM loud. It's very loud. It's a,

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:18.040
uh, a child's play fundraiser. Uh, it is rock band all night long and it has a date for

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.320
this year, December 8th. Now I missed it last year and I was pissed, but you know, real

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.280
life happens sometimes. Uh, but I'm really trying to make it this year and uh, I hope

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.160
you guys can make it too. Book your flights now. It's going to be fun. December 8th. Uh,

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.680
of course it was same, same place. DNA lounge, same city, San Francisco, California, but

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.500
more rock. All right. Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news and uh, go around and do some

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:44.920
quick stories and then we'll get to the tweets, twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, this is kind

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:50.320
of unique. Um, of course with the new rock star game, LA noir coming out next week, they're

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:57.380
kind of, um, I don't know, tying this in with the release of that. They have some collected

01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:04.600
stories that they're releasing on a, an ebook format and you can check it out. It's basically,

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:12.840
uh, an anthology, um, of collected, uh, Hollywood tales from authors like a Megan Abbott, Joyce

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:19.600
Carol Oates and Jonathan, uh, central for, I don't read books, so don't know who these

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:25.160
are. But, um, apparently though, I guess they're going to be kind of like 19, I mean 1940s

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.520
noir detective novels. So that's kind of cool. And uh, the first one, of course they have

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.800
a little sample you can check out of, um, the, uh, the girl, which is, uh, Megan Abbott's

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.560
book. That's going to be the first one coming out and you check that out on a rock stars

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:49.080
website, rockstargames.com slash LA noir, um, slash features slash stories and they'll

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:55.280
be right there. And a pretty cool, uh, idea, I guess they're going to have, I guess eight

01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:03.760
total. Um, and I'm definitely checking out that game when that comes out next week. And

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:10.800
then this is also pretty cool. Uh, with a copy of battle LA on Blu-ray, you can also

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.120
get an early access to the resistance three demo that'll be on the disc. Uh, the demo

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:23.680
will be a 30 minute demo that was, I believe shown off, um, earlier this year. Um, I guess

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.360
back in March they were showing some of that stuff off and, uh, the game looks pretty awesome

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.320
and you know, it kind of ties in with battle LA since, you know, you're battling aliens

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.480
in the United States and stuff like that. Um, so if you really want to check out that

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:42.000
and maybe you just want to buy the movie cause I hear the movie's decent, you know, um, that'd

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.880
be the way to go. So, uh, that's coming out June 14th and I actually probably will pick

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.560
that up cause, uh, watching, I mean, I have to pick it up and make it for free cause I'm

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:59.520
lucky like that. Um, and then, I love Volition and, uh, their Saints Row and Red Faction

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.680
games. I actually haven't played too much of Red Faction, but I really should. But Saints

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.400
Row, I mean, it, they're just very over the top with everything. I don't know if you guys

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.840
remember from Armageddon, um, or, uh, Armageddon, uh, Guerrilla last year they had a, uh, April

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.280
Fool's weapon that they released that actually became a real weapon that was an ostrich.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.320
It was, uh, a melee weapon that you hit people with an ostrich and that was pretty awesome.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:29.480
Um, well now they have, uh, the new weapon which is called Mr. Toots. It is a unicorn

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:35.600
with, it looks like, you know, My Little Pony or something like that, that you pull on its

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.960
tail and it shoots a rainbow out of its ass that makes people explode. Just awesome. That

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:47.400
was in a video that the guy who did the portal video did where he gets a portal gun and his

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.520
friends will care. Yeah, well, that was tying in with this, of course. Um, and, uh, Mr.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:58.760
Toots, of course, is, um, isn't going to be available right away. It will be available

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.960
though if a million people download the demo that is available right now. So, after one

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.960
million downloads of the Red Faction Armageddon demo, Mr. Toots will be unleashed for all

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:17.020
to use. And that is awesome. You know what? I gotta say, with, uh, a unicorn that shoots

01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:21.760
rainbows out of its ass, they're really gonna have to step up their game for, you know,

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.400
Postal 3. Cause I'm sorry, a chainsaw badger? I ain't cutting it anymore. Now a chainsaw

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.800
honey badger. They've gotta make a game based on honey badger at this point. It was already

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.960
angry, er, Naughty Bear. They could do pissed off honey badger. Sorry, they need to make

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:43.840
a good game based off of honey badger. Alright, uh... Naughty Bear was a terrible game, by

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.640
the way. Yeah, the iPhone one is pretty bad too. Okay, anyway, other tweets, er, I'm sorry,

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.120
not tweets yet. We're almost to tweets, but other rapid fire news. Uh, this game, apparently

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.900
it's a rhythm game. For those of you kids that like your rhythm based games, uh, there's

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:02.520
a new game coming out called Pulse Volume 1. Uh, this is a game for the iPad. And I

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.280
guess what this is, it's stationary rings that are in the center of the screen. Each

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.840
ring is larger than the last with the smallest set in the center. And then the number of

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:15.000
rings increase with each difficulty level. Now as a pulse ring grows outward from the

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.640
center, orbs follow along the stationary rings. And as the music plays, pulse rings appear

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:25.000
and reach the orbs to the beat of the song. Scoring is based on the accuracy of orbs hit

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.200
in correlation with the pulse reaching them. Hmm, this could be interesting. So here's

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.880
a little bit of the gameplay. You can kinda hear what some of the music sounds like. You

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.560
can see, it's kinda neat. Like, each pulse is kinda like one measure in the song and

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:42.880
you gotta tap all the little lines. It's kinda like, I don't know, elite beat agents meets

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:54.400
a map of the solar system. There you go. That's Pulse. Uh, some news from Harmonix. Uh, stories

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:59.800
about the, uh, Rock Band download content and where they're at, uh, after the post MTV

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:06.040
Games breakup. Uh, a quote from, uh, Chris Rigopoulos, who is the Vice President of Strategy

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:10.560
and Business Development. Uh, he was interviewed by Game Informer saying that, quote, they've

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.880
effectively severed all ties with MTV and all proceeds from Rock Band belong to Harmonix.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.320
Now this is important because many people thought that, well, the reason why they were

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.640
getting such awesome download content to begin with was because of their partnership with

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:26.600
MTV Games. Now, he continues to say that it has been a collaborative effort between Harmonix

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.860
and MTV in the past. Uh, all the stuff you've seen this year so far, most of that was before

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:36.840
Harmonix was sold by Viacom. Now, the new tracks that'll be coming out soon, that's

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.560
gonna give you the first glimpse at some of the music that the company has secured without

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.320
MTV. And I think Jamie's gonna cover that in a minute. And it still sounds pretty good

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.440
stuff, but I love this. Uh, he doesn't expect that there's gonna be any drastic changes

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:53.920
to the music selection process, but, quote, I doubt you will see any more SpongeBob SquarePants

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.080
packs. Ouch. So I guess that was not something they wanted to do, but they did anyway. Well,

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:04.840
yeah, that makes sense, you know. Viacom, you know, I think it's Nintendo, or not Nintendo,

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:10.560
Nickelodeon, MTV, yeah. Uh, also, speaking of Rock Band, this is very important, there

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.520
will be no Rock Band 4 this year. Yeah, I'm not surprised. Uh, yeah, kind of file that

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.440
under duh. I mean, it took a couple years for Rock Band 3, uh, but they are not gonna

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.600
be doing a Rock Band 4 this year, and I'm kinda not surprised because, you know, Guitar

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.260
Heroes on hiatus, Rock Band 3 unfortunately didn't sell well, and it's, it's a bummer

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:33.560
because it's a great title. It's down to 10 bucks at Toys R Us now. It's, honestly, you're,

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:38.720
if you like music games in the slightest, you've gotta get Rock Band 3, it's awesome.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:44.700
So take advantage of the $10 sale, I suppose, uh, and go check that out. Uh, probably this

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.840
year's at E3 you're gonna see more from Harmonix, like Dance Central 2 will probably be their

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:54.840
big title. Maybe something unannounced, who knows? Uh, maybe something to take on a different

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:58.240
type of music game. We'll see, you know, there's always been that rumor that they want to review

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:01.760
and revisit the amplitude frequency type of games. That could always be something they

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.920
show. Got a DJ game would be awesome. We'll see. So, but, uh, no Rock Band 4. Maybe next

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:11.520
year or the year after that when people are back into music games. I would say it's gonna

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.600
take until whenever the next series of systems comes out, but we'll see. Dark Sakura. There

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:23.760
is a PS3 bundle coming out for Black Ops in three weeks. Um, Call of Duty Black Ops will

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:32.940
have one that has 100, that, uh, excuse me. It's, let me start over. There is a PS3 bundle

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:37.600
with Black Ops arriving. It's Call of Duty Black Ops on PS3. It will have 160 gigabyte

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:45.940
hard drive and will be 300 bucks. And, uh, hopefully we will hear something from Activision

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:53.220
and Sony soon, but this is still just, uh, coming from retail. 100% true. Okay. Super

01:32:53.220 --> 01:33:00.640
Meat Boy level editor is out. Yay. So you can go and, uh, download it. It's on Steam.

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:07.680
Make some levels, share them with everybody. And they better not suck. And in the... They'll

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:13.080
all be hard as hell. You know, cause people... Aren't all the levels hard as hell? In Super

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:21.460
Meat Boy, yeah. Well, there is a, of course, another Rock Band pack coming out, uh, this

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:28.600
month here in May. There will be tracks from, uh, the Foo Fighters album, uh, Wasting Light.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:32.860
And then, uh, there will be pro guitar and bass upgrades to older Rock Band tracks. There

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:40.540
will also, um, be, uh, some Lady Gaga. Are you happy, Rob? Absolutely. Cause you know

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:45.160
I'll be singing that in the privacy of my own home. And Peter Frampton. I live with

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:50.220
someone now. Oh well, they can deal. It's Do You Feel Like We Do, which is from Frampton

01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:56.660
Comes Alive, which my former stepfather had that album. I love that they have from Lady

01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:02.760
Gaga to Peter fucking Frampton. Oh, and Ozzy. There will be Ozzy. You know what? I want

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:10.660
some damn Lita Ford. I want the Ozzy Lita Ford duet. Close My Eyes Forever. I love that

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.580
song. You know what I would like to see in Rock Band, especially now that they have piano?

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:20.860
Meat Loaf. Yes. Yes. We need the Rocky down like that. Well, they did have some Meat Loaf.

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:24.260
I thought, like, around Valentine's Day they had some Meat Loaf stuff. Oh my god, maybe

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:30.060
I missed it. I think there's, um... I'm checking the list of Rock Band downloads now. I know

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:37.140
that there's a couple of, uh... In fact, you were excited about one. I wanna say. This

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:40.420
is important information. I need to know what Meat Loaf songs are available. This will complete

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:46.620
Rob's life. It really will. Just do a search. Control F Meat Loaf. Or I could just alphabetize

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:52.900
the list and then scroll down to M. H I J K. I'm gonna say F. There's Megadeth, Megadeth,

01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:57.780
More Megadeth, Screwed. Oh, one Meat Loaf song. One Meat Loaf song. Paradise by the

01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:02.980
Dashboard Light. Cause you were giddy about that. That's not enough Meat Loaf. There's

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:07.120
always room for Meat Loaf. Meat Bat Out of Hell. Wouldn't it be great if we had the Rocky

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.180
Download Pack? I thought there was a Rocky song in Rock Band. No, it was in Guitar Hero.

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:15.260
There's, uh... I think there's songs in Guitar Hero, but I don't have Guitar Hero. We need

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:19.580
the whole thing for Rock Band. That would be great. That would be awesome. And we need

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:26.580
the trumpet. We need the saxophone controller next. Alright, any more news? No. Alright,

01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:32.000
well if there is, I don't care. Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics then. Every week

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.220
we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r because of course this is the show where

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:43.060
every gamer has a voice. Let's go to the first tweet tonight from uh... we already covered

01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:46.980
that story. So we'll go to M. N. Zeba. Ooh, I remember reading about this too. M. N. Zeba

01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:53.700
tweeted us saying, the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword GDC 2011 trailer music played backwards

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:59.100
is very familiar. So apparently... It wasn't to me. A person who, you know, I'll let you

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:06.100
get into that. Alright, so here it is, played backwards. And this is backwards right now.

01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:37.100
Now, that's a little tune from Ocarina, right? Is that why? Yes, I did. People were flipping

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.860
their shit about this? Yeah. Once again though, me not really giving a crap about Ocarina

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.120
of Time, that was totally lost to me. I was like... But it's this whole setup because

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.520
we have the Ocarina of Time re-release coming out first. Eh, big deal. Alright, well that

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:58.220
was a tweet from M. N. Zeba. Alright, Blue Swim tweet says, rumor has it that Namco Bandai

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:03.820
Games America has licensed Sailor Moon? And he tweets us to a site that he actually works

01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:10.140
for. But I'm assuming he's going on good authority. Oh, I see. Sailor Moon World Italy apparently

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.460
is the source here. Some new companies have evolved, acquired licenses for Sailor Moon

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:19.980
and one of them is Namco Bandai Games America. Oh boy, I hope we get a Kinect Sailor Moon

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:26.160
game that we can do the transformation. Dark Sakura, would you play that? Maybe. I'm not

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:32.140
that acrobatic. You know you would. Alright, Silver Sonic tweets us to a story about, what

01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:38.480
else, Sonic. Sonic Generations rumor coming to Nintendo 3DS. A portable version of Sonic

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.940
Generations coming to the 3DS. Apparently it's from a GameStop report that shows upcoming

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:49.220
skews and it's listed for the very end of the year, a placeholder end of 2011 date.

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:57.380
So there you go. So some folks are yelling at me in chat that I didn't go through the

01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:03.500
whole video. Well what am I going to see if I go through the whole video? Alright, tell

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.320
me what I'm going to see and then I'll go back to the whole video. Alright, going to

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:16.860
DJ Rama S tweets us saying, IGN acquires UGO. No one, Ker. No one, Ker. Great, the corporate

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:25.580
collective grows bigger. Congrats. Now they own 1UP and IGN. Yep. Congrats. Yep. Alright,

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:31.140
let's see, Tiger Claw links us to a few stories here. Valve is starting to look at Steam Mobile.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:36.300
Oh that would be kind of neat. Like a mobile based Steam store. I'm assuming that can't

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:41.220
really compete with the iPhone. I mean, excuse me, it would compete with the iPhone but it

01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.660
can't be on the iPhone I suppose. Or maybe it could. I guess you could always do something

01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:50.340
like that because if you sold it through the Apple store and then it could have the add-ons,

01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:54.260
I don't know. But I don't know if that's what Valve would do. Anyway, Valve is saying that

01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:58.100
they're looking at the possibility of bringing Steam to mobile devices. According to this

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:03.940
story, it's from Trademag MCV and I guess it's something that the Valve marketing vice

01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:08.180
president Doug Lombardi says that the more requests that Valve receives for a mobile

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:14.180
version of the platform, the more likely it is to act. We'll see what happens with that.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:19.320
At least you know you get some hella good sales on that. All right, let's see. Tiger

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:25.620
Claw 305 also links us to Smithsonian announces lineup for art of video games exhibit. Oh

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:29.620
that's kind of cool. That's right, the Smithsonian was supposed to be doing something with that.

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:35.500
So it's running from March 16th of next year through September 30th and yeah, that's pretty

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:41.060
awesome. So the Smithsonian, which is funny because remember that whole video games aren't

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:44.660
art debate that went on a couple years ago. Well now they're going to show video game

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:49.580
art in the Smithsonian. So I don't know. I think that kind of ends that argument. By

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:53.860
the way, there's a quote here that sells the exhibition quote. Video games use images,

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.700
actions, and player participation to tell stories and engage their audiences in the

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:02.100
same way as film, animation, and performance. They can be considered a compelling and influential

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:07.180
form of narrative arts. New technologies have allowed designers to create increasingly interactive

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:11.540
and sophisticated game environments while staying grounded in traditional game types.

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:16.260
The exhibition will feature 80 games through still images and video footage. There will

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:19.660
be five playable games in the exhibit. Pac-Man, Super Mario Brothers, The Secret of Monkey

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.420
Island, Myst, and World of Warcraft. There will also be video interviews with notable

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:30.480
game developers, large prints of screenshots, antique consoles, 3.7 million votes cast in

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:37.620
a poll over 175 countries. There's 80 games in the exhibit including Zelda, Donkey Kong,

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:42.660
Doom 2, but there are some missing. This article calls out Space Harrier and Beyond Good and

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:48.300
Evil. But you know what? When there's only 80 games, sadly some good ones are probably

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:53.780
going to be lost by the wayside. All right. A few more tweets for you guys here. JV Mon

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:58.460
tweets us about Thomas Howard. Remember Thomas Howard Lichtenstein, I think his name is,

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:06.340
of DDR fame. Remember that? Apparently, it's a song with Disco Warp. They were in DDR universe

01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:11.620
and this is some type of indie band collaboration here. I guess they're all straight out of

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:33.020
Portland. So here's the song. Oh my gosh. There's too much noise in that song. There's

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.500
just too much noise. I'm just picturing a lot of 13 year olds at a rave now. So where's

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.540
Thomas Howard coming to that? I imagine he sings at some point, but I don't know if I

01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:44.100
can get to that point. I'm not saying a song is bad, but I'm just saying it's a lot of

01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:48.820
new. Maybe the middle is a little bit different. Oh, is it the wrong song? Oh, JV Mon said

01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:56.020
I played the wrong song. My bad. Well, I clicked the link you sent me. All right, here we go.

01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:11.620
Let's try this one instead. Is that like the anti-auto tune? Why? Why did they do that?

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:28.300
It's okay. Too many effects. You don't need it. That was better than the first song, but

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:34.780
yeah, it's just, uh, don't need all the effects on there, buddy. All right. Uh, let's see.

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:40.460
Last tweet here from Salacious Pop. Jack's beef jerky, ew, uh, is running promos for

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:46.020
Xbox live arcade and Hulu plus. I got three months gold for 1295 and a month of Hulu plus

01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:54.300
for free. Any thoughts? Okay. First off Hulu plus is, it sucks because you're paying to

01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:58.120
watch commercials and I don't like that at all. I mean, yes, they have a big archive

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:03.680
of shows, but you know, so does Netflix and I think there's plenty of stuff to watch on

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.780
there and the internet. Uh, also the other thing to keep in mind, the Hulu plus interface

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:12.580
on Xbox fucking blows because they've done that whole crossbar thing with Hulu plus and

01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:18.780
it doesn't work. The crossbar thing does not work for everything and Hulu plus and Facebook

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:21.680
and Twitter and all this other stuff they try to integrate next, but that crossbar thing

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:28.820
does not work for it. Uh, so yeah, I guess you can set up a queue online to do Hulu plus

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:32.020
and that's kinda, I guess the way you're supposed to do it. But did you know that a lot of the

01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:36.500
stuff you can watch on the web, you can't watch on your Xbox. It's not licensed for

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:46.940
playback on the Xbox. No more reason why Hulu plus is kind of dumb. Sorry. Um, or yes, or

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:53.980
you could set up your queue and then download diversity. Of course you have to buy diversity

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:58.500
I suppose, but you can download, I'm sure a streaming program and link it with that

01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:02.260
and you can actually stream all that stuff through there. Uh, some comments in our chatroom

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:06.020
at chat.orns lounge radio.com. Uh, Black Wolf says you have to give your credit card

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:11.100
to get the free month. Oh, uh, break man says I like Hulu pluses TV selection, but the movie

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:15.780
selection sucks. Salacious pop clarifies the biggest draw to Hulu plus is that they let

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:20.380
you watch shows on demand that are still current from just last week, et cetera. You know how

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:27.260
else you can watch shows that are still current Torrance or, or most of them are on like cbs.com

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:32.540
has most of the CBS shows and NBC. Most of them are available that way, but like the

01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:37.180
real, real stuff like HBO, like if you want to watch, I don't know what the tutors or

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:42.980
any of that showtime. We just got HBO actually because we have upgraded our Comcast, whatever,

01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.660
because they're going to give us the same thing. Plus our phone for the same price we

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:50.740
had already, but they gave us, they give us a Gaga concert last night. Yeah, that's the

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:57.860
thing though. They gave us HBO, but it doesn't work because we were, we're like, okay, what

01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.940
should we watch? Oh God concert. Okay, well we don't have anything else to watch. So we

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:07.020
clicked on that. This channel is not available like, but they were supposed to give it to

01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:11.460
us for free for three months. So great. There's something else that's wrong with Comcast.

01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:16.340
Hooray. But Hey, we have a DVR now. So that's in our chat room says, or you could watch

01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:22.380
it on the TV. If you want to watch a current show, you could turn on your TV and watch

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:26.860
it. That's a good point. We caught up on the office lesson instead. I watched survivor

01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:30.340
live every week. I don't have a DVR anymore. I don't record shows. So if I don't watch

01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:36.980
it live, I'm either watching it on cbs.com or Netflix or Hulu.com the free version or

01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:44.260
something. Torrance are great. Or if you want to get into this century with the piracy,

01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:49.960
um, use net or, you know, the file share sites are way better and faster. By the way, I think

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.380
I should be on survivor because like, seriously, this season is driving me bonkers because

01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:59.060
there's all these bimbos on that show that are totally being controlled right now. I

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:06.700
can't stand it. I'm just saying if I went on that show, I'd be the one in charge. Bitches

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:13.700
better watch it. That's right. Watch it. That's it for tweets, twitter.com slash O L R. Uh,

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:18.100
let's move on to some more news. Listless coming up in just a moment, but first a round

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:27.140
of stories. Yeah. Um, so Kami's planning this sort of party or I don't know. Um, they're

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:33.420
doing a pre E3 show on June 2nd, I guess a few days before E3 starts. The event will

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:37.860
be streamed online. They haven't said which sites yet. Um, and there's going to be, I

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:45.540
guess, um, like a sitting room where people can watch trailers for stuff and they're also

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:53.420
going to have like, uh, parties in LA, San Francisco, Toronto, um, Sao Paulo and Mexico

01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:59.060
city and other cities. They haven't really finalized this list of cities yet. Um, and

01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:03.340
apparently they're going to be inviting the press and stuff like that to these things.

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:11.620
Oh, I guess we need no fucking invite. And you know, I can, I can, I can understand that,

01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:15.300
you know, uh, you know, what whole LA thinks that's, that's fucking far and they're not

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.740
going to pay for us to fly in there. But San Francisco, man, that's like, that's like an

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:25.980
hour or two away. And whatever, you know what, I don't give a shit about your fucking Yu-Gi-Oh

01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:31.820
game that you have there. Um, so yeah. And then I think also on their Facebook and stuff,

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.660
they were doing this contest where like, be the ultimate Konami fan and tell us why you

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:41.780
are the ultimate Konami fan. You can win like an iPad or, you know, a trip to E3 or some

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:48.540
crap like that. So, uh, more on that I'm sure as we get closer to the states, cause obviously

01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.740
they haven't really announced too much other than, Hey, we're going to be, uh, doing our

01:47:52.740 --> 01:48:01.700
first annual pre-E3 show. So not really niche. Maybe we can make a drinking game out of that

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:09.100
too. That'd be fun. We could. I mean, obviously they're going to be showing what, um, the,

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:15.300
uh, Melger Solid, um, Rising Game, which still hasn't come out. So that, that's probably,

01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:23.300
you know, one of the big things. Silent Hill Downpour. That'll be another big one. Um,

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.020
that's pretty much it. I mean, I guess, I guess they're bringing No More Heroes over

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:37.300
here. They're localizing that for the PS3. Um, so they'll show that. But we've got our

01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:43.660
Dance Masters game. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if anyone caught some of my tweets

01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:49.940
earlier this week. Uh, you know, I, Red Bull in the Morning does some weird things to my

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:58.900
brain, but I got this wonderful, weird idea of pitching a game to Konami, you know, like

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:05.340
fixing DDR, I guess, you know, making it, rebooting, rebooting, I guess. Um, that's

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:10.220
the hip thing to do in Hollywood these days, rebooting it. And I don't think it's that

01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:15.420
far off. Obviously, it's gonna be a hell of a lot of work, and I need to, um, do that

01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:20.540
right now. But first, you gotta get somebody's ear. Good luck with that. No, not actually,

01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:25.380
because, um, you know, do the pitch first, then get the person's ear. Or copyright your

01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:33.140
idea first, and then, that's how you do it. Do it the smart way. But, yeah, just because,

01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:39.460
I mean, come on. I mean, I actually did the math, and this is great, and might as well

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:44.500
bring this up, since we're talking about it. And just to kind of show you real quick, um,

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:51.540
or demonstrate how, how the franchise has fallen. For example, I did the numbers. According

01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:59.860
to the NPD reports, January 2011, this would be everything from 2010 and back, um, their

01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:06.180
game series. Okay, so let's start with, um, on the Wii. Hottest Party sold 2 million units.

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:09.620
That's a little over 2 million units. The original Hottest Party in 2007. Original Hottest

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:21.380
Party. 08. Hottest Party 2. 1.5 million units. 2009. Hottest Party 3. 390,000 units. 2010.

01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:27.780
Dance Dance Revolution. Remember their kind of reboot thing. 170,000 units. And then on

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:34.420
the Playstation 3, Dance Dance Revolution, 60,000. You know, combine, and compare that

01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:41.540
to, you know, um, you know, oh, and Dance Master is only 47,000 units. Oh, wow. Compare

01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:48.100
that to Just Dance 2, which came out October, which was about a month before, uh, Dance

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:55.060
Dance Revolution. 3.5 million units sold. That's more than all of, well, the first two,

01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:01.740
uh, Hottest Party games combined. So, it's sad, because they could really be, they're

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.500
just not putting a lot of effort into it anymore. Uh, Brakeman in our chatroom asks, what the

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:09.940
F is Hottest Party? Is that one of those AO games? Now, that would be an awesome way to

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:14.780
reboot the series, don't you agree? Uh, DDR Dolla Bill in our chatroom says, I didn't

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:18.540
even know DDR kept getting releases until someone gave me the step mania files. Maybe

01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:22.260
that's part of the problem. The community's been kind of, like, if you go to DDR Freak,

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:25.900
you'll see the tumbleweed rolling by. I mean, there's not nearly the community they're used

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.220
to, you know. But I don't think they really need necessarily the community for it. There's

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:35.940
not a big community for Just Dance. True. I mean, it's all about being current, and

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:39.820
I think what the problem's been is they've been trying to innovate with the series, and

01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:43.100
they just don't know how. They don't really know which direction to take it in, so they're

01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:48.260
taking it in all the directions at the same time. You know, they're like, oh, okay, we're

01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:54.980
gonna innovate by adding 8 panel dance mode, or something like that. No, that's not what

01:51:54.980 --> 01:52:00.900
you do. They're trying to shove square pegs into the round hole. Exactly. That's the problem.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:07.100
And I think, I don't know. I have some good ideas. It's hard to describe them over the

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:13.300
radio because it's all in my head right now, and I've tried to, like, sit down and type

01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:20.680
out what I'm thinking, but if I can get what's in my head on paper, it's gonna be awesome.

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:26.580
That's the problem. But I have some fresh ideas for it, so see if I don't get bored

01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:33.540
of this whole idea and actually finish it and be able to pitch it. It would be awesome.

01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:37.120
But yeah, once again, you know they're not gonna give a shit if they're not, you know,

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.340
if they're just, you know, they don't want to try, then that's fine. So folks in the

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:46.020
chat room are commenting that folks moved on to other websites, like Bamani style and

01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:51.060
so forth, but those websites are not just about DDR, and usually DDR seems to not be

01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:54.720
the focus at all. You know what I mean? So that's why DDR is continuing to plummet. Other

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:59.220
games might be doing okay. Like, DJ Max Portable got released in the US because of the following

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.980
it has here, but, you know, DDR is a different game. The thing is though, it's, you know,

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:09.180
Dance Dance Revolution was kind of like the innovator, you know, it brought, you know,

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:13.820
kind of people to the genre first, and then, you know, now they have these other games

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:18.220
out there, and they're doing really well. And that's not to say that Dance Dance Revolution

01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:22.700
can't do very, you know, that well, even if it did half as well, it would still be way

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.320
better than what it is now. And so that's the thing is, all they have to do is figure

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:31.700
out how to capture that audience, and I think I know how to do that, just based off of what

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.980
they've done and what hasn't worked. And what has worked, and you just kind of combine all

01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:39.120
the, they have all the pieces there, it's just, they're not doing it right. Well I want

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:43.860
to know, I hope you get your audience with Konami someday. Alright, let's move on. A

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:47.760
couple more stories for you guys, yeah, buy stock. I actually thought about buying stock

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:54.220
in Sony, just so I could sign a petition to shake up the management, but we'll see. Alright,

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:59.100
anyhow, quick, quick story about Quake and Wolfenstein. Yes, some old, old properties

01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:03.780
that are, you know, very near and dear in a lot of First Person Shooter fans' hearts.

01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:10.860
An interesting comment from senior producer Jason Kim when Shaq News spoke with id Software,

01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:14.620
I call him ID Software, some people call him id, quote, our studio has grown a lot, not

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:19.920
just in size, but also in design and art process, and even a technology standpoint. John Carmack

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:23.340
has admitted that he can't do everything on his own. There are a lot of smart guys that

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:27.700
are required to be able to make a game these days. We have Quake, we have Wolfenstein.

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:31.460
If people want that, we have the IPs to deliver it, and we have a different approach now.

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:35.100
We're forging a new path. I think we can freshen those things up. We don't have anything in

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:38.340
the works right now, but I think when we start talking about different things we can do with

01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:42.060
the other properties that we have, I hope people are receptive to what we want to do,

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:47.260
and what we think would be fun for players to experience coming out of id Software. Well,

01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:50.860
I mean, there was a new Wolfenstein game not that long ago, and it wasn't very remarkable,

01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:56.300
and then there was a, the Quake Arena on Xbox Live's pretty cool, but the Quake 4 was not

01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:00.260
cool actually, it was not that great, because that was on Xbox 360, right? Yeah, it wasn't

01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:05.820
very good. So, uh, yeah. We'll see. I mean, I'm all for going back to the drawing board

01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:10.340
with new ideas, and those are two big properties. I used to love Quake back in the day. And

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.420
Quake 3 and Quake Arena are actually a lot of fun, so. Did you ever play Ascii Quake?

01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:20.500
No, I never played Ascii Quake. But, I remember the old Quake CD. I always got to Quake. I

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:27.740
got to Doom. People have a lot of free time on their hands, what can I say? Alright, so,

01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:31.820
speaking of a lot of free time on our hands, a little segment we like to do on this show

01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:39.220
once in a while is a segment where we try to come up with the definitive list on a topic.

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:43.460
That's right, after we're done tonight, we are going to go through a list and find out

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:53.120
the exact top 3 scientifically proven answers to a topic. It's a process we call listless!

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.460
The way listless works, since we haven't played this in a little while. We're going to give

01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:01.700
you a topic, and the topic tonight is thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back

01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:06.220
to make me care about it again. And then the 4 of us, yes we're going to get someone online

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.620
in just a moment, the 4 of us will go around the room and each give our top 3 answers as

01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:14.820
to what should be on that list. That will leave us with a list of 12. Then, the hard

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:20.300
part, oh this is the hard part, but you know reality shows are all about voting things

01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:24.780
off, so we each go around and take one thing off the list. That leaves us with a list of

01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:30.740
8 that you the chatters get to vote on, and you vote for your top 3 and that's it, that's

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:36.260
the list. That's the answers right there. Tonight's topic, thing PlayStation Network

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:40.260
needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. You can give your answers in our

01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:44.020
chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, I can't guarantee we'll use them, but when one

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:47.660
of our hosts is struggling to find an answer or if something gets duplicated, we'll usually

01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:52.100
turn to the chatroom. Alright, let's bring in our 4th person here, I'm going to go ahead

01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:56.980
and give them a call. Let me dip the Skype line down here, or I'm sorry, let me dip the

01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:59.620
music down here for just a minute so we can call on the Skype line. I've got somebody

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:07.060
set up here. Hello. Hi, is this Tiara? Yes, it is. It's the one and only Tiara aka Marin

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:12.540
Marvel joining us tonight. You might have heard the commercial for pop culture parlay

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:17.020
in between the segments tonight if you were listening live. Tell us real quick about,

01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:23.140
pimp your projects, Marin Marvel, before you play with us tonight. Well, as you know, I

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:28.340
steal Jamie about once a week and we do Comic Insanity, which is a comics and kind of like

01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:34.220
a geek culture podcast where we talk about fun stuff. And then there's Pop Culture Parlay,

01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:40.980
which is just kind of a little bit of craziness where Weasel aka Jonathan Long, who works

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:47.780
for EA, and myself kind of talk about different pop culture stuff. We've done like Star Wars

01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:53.540
versus Star Trek. We've talked about the best Batman. We've talked about all sorts of random

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:59.420
stuff. So it's just really, really fun. Really, really good time and that's on geek-life.com.

01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:04.000
Awesome. Well, best of luck with all those projects. You know I like to sometimes poke

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.580
fun at the stuff you and Dark Sakura do at the Giggling Girls show, but you guys do very

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.420
hard work. So best of luck. All right. You ready to play listless with us tonight? I

01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:17.720
sure am. Yay. Then I can play music again. All right. Of course, the topic tonight,

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:23.060
Thing PlayStation Network could do to get me to come back once it, or I'm sorry, wait,

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:27.460
what was the exact thing I wrote here? Thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back

01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:31.940
to make me care again, because you know, it's been 18 days. Most of us now are used to a

01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:36.780
life without PlayStation Network. So what is it that they can do to make me give a care

01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:40.100
when they come back? They've been talking about this welcome back program. Let's see,

01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:43.900
we're going to go around the room and get the top three. We will start with, we'll let

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:47.620
the ladies go first. Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. What is your number three answer

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:56.620
on the list? Thing they could do to get you to come back? Mind control via nanobots. Mind

01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.980
control via nanobots. How would that work with a PlayStation? By the way, your answers

01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:03.220
can be as serious or as silly as you want. That's part of the fun. Because I have a first

01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:08.020
model PS3, so clearly it has the hardware inside of it to create nanobots based off

01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:12.420
of data sent in through the PSN once it comes back up. And what would be the first thing

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:17.500
you'd mind control? No, it would mind control me to care. Oh, okay, I see, I see. Yeah,

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:22.300
it would mind control me to care. Okay, there you go. Alright, Mar and Marvel, we'll go

01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:26.900
to you. What's your number three answer? Thing that PlayStation could do to get you to care?

01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:33.860
Well, since there's all this talk about how, you know, our data has been like stolen, maybe

01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:38.220
they could give us like a year of free credit reporting so that we can keep an eye on our

01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:43.380
credit and like make sure that those people that are stealing our information aren't like

01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:48.900
buying things from Nigerians and stuff. To be fair, they sort of did, but I think you're

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:52.380
talking about something a little more intense than what this whole Debex thing is about.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:58.100
Debex is credit monitoring, but not credit reporting. So there is a difference. All right.

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:01.940
All right. Just want to clarify the difference for our listeners because you know how internet

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:07.620
people will be. They'll say, dear orange lounge radio, your guest was uninformed. All right.

02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:12.820
Anyhow, let's move on. My number three answer thing that PlayStation Network could do. How

02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:18.940
about a PlayStation two emulator download for my collection? Yeah, they've been rumored

02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:24.380
to work on one of those for years. I'd like to see that come out. So PlayStation two emulator,

02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:29.380
I don't care how they have to get it to work. Just get it to work. If you want me to care.

02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:33.500
All right. That's my number three answer. Loki, what is your number three answer? Uh,

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:39.820
here's the problem is I don't really care. Um, but so I'll just try to pick popular answers

02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:48.180
instead. This one will go for Rob, uh, upping the cap of members allowed in the PlayStation

02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:53.740
home clubs. I like say a billion. That would be perfect. That is a practical answer. I

02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:59.300
love that. Cause right now in the orange lounge radio club, I'm allowed to have 25 people

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:02.960
when I have people that's not a club. I don't want to sound cocky. We have a little more

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:08.100
than 25 people that listen to this program that have a PlayStation three. So I would

02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:12.260
really like to be able to invite more people because unfortunately we've got a list of

02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:17.700
about, I'm, I've shit you not more than 25 waiting like invites. I can't do anything

02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:22.180
with them because I'm limited. Of course, I don't know what we would do in the PlayStation

02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:29.660
home club. I just want to have a big club. Let's go to dark Sakura place or excuse me,

02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:34.060
your number two answer for the listing PlayStation network could do to get you to care, morph

02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:42.540
the system into a dream cast to has been left in the other room. So it would just instantly

02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:48.500
transform wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. And it's a dream cast to outstanding with a big Sega

02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:54.980
logo flipping off PlayStation via a firmware update. All right, Martin Marvel, your number

02:01:54.980 --> 02:02:07.820
two answer. I would like a new attachment for the PS three that serves frozen yogurt.

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:11.540
It doesn't have to be Pinkberry. You know, I'm not, I'm not a snob here. You're not asking

02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:16.500
for the world. Just frozen yogurt. All right. I like that. A new attachment that will serve

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.980
frozen yogurt. I like that answer. All right. Uh, let's see my number two answer for thing

02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:26.300
that they could do, uh, to get me to care about PlayStation network. Uh, guardian legend

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:32.340
two released as a PlayStation network exclusive. Of course, the greatest, most underrated eight

02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:39.700
bit game of all time. Guardian legend two would have to come out as a PSN exclusive.

02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:44.100
That would get me to care and it better be better than that blaster master remake they

02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:52.060
had on week is that was not the quality of my need. That was weak. I see what you did

02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:58.980
there. Good one. Loki, your number two answer. Uh, once again, like reiterate, I really don't

02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:06.540
care. Um, I guess since it would make a lot of people happy and probably end a lot of

02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:13.660
their problems, just bring back the, uh, Linux support or other OS, I guess, you know, here's

02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:17.780
a thought, Sony, you could, you know, you could patch that so that, you know, maybe

02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:23.580
it doesn't allow you access to everything. Why is that? See, I never understood that.

02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:27.460
Let's just get rid of the whole Linux support instead of, I don't know, patching it so that

02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:32.060
it doesn't allow people to hack us. You know, I can't, I can't for the life of me believe

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:37.060
that amongst all this talk of frozen yogurt and mind control, Loki is the voice of reason

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:44.060
tonight here on orange lounge radio. Am I in bizarro world? What is going on? Anything

02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:54.300
from them. What do I want? It's like a blow job. That's what you want. No, I Sony blow

02:03:54.300 --> 02:04:05.220
job. Really? I mean, that would be unsatisfying. I could tell you that much. All right, here's

02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:12.100
the list as it is so far. We disabled the good feature, you know, we disabled the humming

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:18.900
feature mind control via nano bots. We disabled the feature that will swallow. All right now,

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:24.260
mind control via nano bots. Give us a year of free credit reporting, PlayStation two

02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:29.620
emulator downloading, upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs, morph the system into

02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:35.180
a dreamcast to walla walla walla new attachment that serves frozen yogurt, guardian legend

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:40.940
to PlayStation network exclusive and bring back the other OS feature. All right, let's

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:45.820
go around and get the number one answers from the folks here in studio, dark soccer, number

02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:53.420
one thing that could bring you back a year of pink berry, a year of pink berry with this,

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:57.100
with this actually come out of the PlayStation three, like Mara Marvel suggested, or would

02:04:57.100 --> 02:05:02.260
this be just a coupon redeemable at your local store? It would be like a card that's got

02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:08.420
like 365 charges on it for pink berry. I speak because I like going to pink berry and listening

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:20.500
to the music. All right, Mara and Marvel, your number three answer. How about some free download content, like for people who, for like, you know, co-op games and games that you play online.

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:23.780
So since people have missed all that kind of stuff during this whole debacle, they can

02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:28.980
get some free download content and make up for not shooting things. I'm sorry. And of

02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:33.260
course, that's the number one answer. I just shortened that to free download content of

02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:41.700
good games. Yes. As opposed to like, you know, undertow. All right. Free download or, or,

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:47.500
uh, Yaris. Okay. Free download content of good games. All right. My number one answer

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:51.160
to the question thing placed it, by the way, I have to read this comment from salacious

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:56.440
pop. A Sony blow job is $30 more expensive from a similar competent brand. And the no

02:05:56.440 --> 02:06:01.540
toothy head feature has to be ordered from a neighboring store and costs even more. All

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:07.060
right. My number one answer for thing PlayStation network needs when it comes back to make me

02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:17.860
care about it again. Drum roll, please. Gay pornography, which is even more fun than funny

02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:22.300
than straight pornography. All right. That was my number one answer. Gay pornography

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:28.100
would get me to care selling, selling gay porn on the end. Yeah. Okay. So that all you

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:33.420
like, you know, straight guys at home, they're going fine. Lesbian porn galore. Just les

02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:41.260
bows are us is what the PlayStation store renames itself to enjoy. All right. Loki,

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:47.020
your number one answer for the thing placed in network could do to get you back. Um, give

02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:55.460
a fuck about it. Um, you know, this is, those even have to be free and it's not even necessarily

02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:59.540
something that they give to me, but it'd be kind of cool if they put out a new AIBO, I

02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:06.980
guess. I mean, I don't know. I really Loki. Why not? I mean, okay, everybody point and

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:14.220
laugh at Loki. I don't know. I just like, I, I don't care that their networks now cause

02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:21.180
they never used it. The thing you want most of the world. Loki is a new AIBO. Not really.

02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:27.020
I actually, I would like, no, scratch that. Let's screw. Screw the AIBO thing. All right.

02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:34.620
All right. Okay. Thing I would like most from Sony thing from Sony. They have really no

02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:39.740
power to do this, but I would like the clerks animated series back on air. So, you know,

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:44.900
maybe they could, you know, make that happen. That would be awesome. All right. So get the

02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:51.220
clerks animated series back on air. All right. Much better answer. All right. So let's recap

02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:55.900
the list. Here comes the hard part. You guys, we got to take one off the list. I'm sorry.

02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:59.940
It's just the way it works. It's a, it's a, it's tough love folks. It's tough love. Here's

02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:05.700
the list is a stand so far. Mind control via nanobots. Give us a year of free credit reporting

02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:11.140
PlayStation two emulator, downloading upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs morph

02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:16.700
the system into a dreamcast to walla walla walla walla new attachment that serves frozen

02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:23.540
yogurt guardian legend to PSN exclusive. Bring back the other OS feature. Did I cut out for

02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:28.980
a minute? Sorry. Bring back the other OS feature. A year of pink Berry, free download content

02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:36.220
of good games, gay pornography and clerks animated series back on air. These are all

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:41.300
things that could actually happen. I like how SSJ 100 Matt says won't happen. Disney

02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:47.620
has the rights to it. Who said this is realistic at all? SSJ 100 Matt. This is what we want.

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:52.720
They have to, I don't, I don't give a shit that Disney own it owns it. Make it happen.

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:56.500
By the way, let's read some of the comments from chat here. Uh, let's see what were some

02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:01.160
of the stuff. Uh, break man says, cause her eye kills a puppy. Anytime someone mentions

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.340
free games on his network. That's not an answer. We wouldn't want to kill puppies. That's not

02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:09.460
going to get us do anything. Uh, bonds 006 agrees. Make PS3 backward compatible. Uh,

02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:16.140
SSJ 100 Matt make president cap playable for the move. Uh, dark Tetsuya says make PlayStation

02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:21.620
network out of bacon. Uh, lots of good answers there in chat, but unfortunately we've got

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:27.100
to go through the list and figure out what is not worthy of the list. So dark Sakura,

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:40.940
which of these items is not worthy of the list? It's going to be tough. Um, bring back

02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:45.500
the other OS cause I don't give a shit. All right. She's striking what is probably the

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:52.940
most logical answer on the entire list. Bring back the other OS feature. It has been stricken

02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:57.820
from the list. All right. Uh, Marin Marvel, hopefully you have the list in your mind.

02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:01.740
You know what you want to take off. Which one of these is not worthy of the list? Well,

02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:06.420
personally I don't want my brain controlled by nanobots, so I'm going to have to go with

02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:13.100
that one. All right. So mind control via nanobots. It has been stricken from the list. Uh, the

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:17.940
answer I'm going to have to remove from the list. I'm so sorry, but when you have pink

02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:22.680
berry and frozen yogurt on the same list, pink berry wins. So I have to eliminate the

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:27.700
new attachment that serves frozen yogurt. Attachment that serves frozen yogurt could

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:34.060
serve pink berry. I'm just saying the PS three is too hot. It's a George Foreman grill, so

02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:38.380
it has been removed from the list. Sorry. All right, low key. Which one of these is

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:52.500
not worthy of the list? A lot. Um, no offense. Uh, I'm going to have to say, uh, so wrong

02:10:52.500 --> 02:11:02.660
but uh, yeah, I'm going to have to say free download content of good games. It's just,

02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:08.860
come on. That's a cheap way out. Free download card. Here's a dollar. Screw that. All right.

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:14.500
So here is the list as it is right now. Give us a year of free credit reporting. PlayStation

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:19.660
two emulators down that one. Oh, well being the cap of members allowed in home clubs morph

02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:23.900
the system into a dreamcast to wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall. Guardian legend

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:30.060
to PlayStation network exclusive a year of pink berry, gay pornography and clerks animated

02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:34.440
series back on air. How did gay pornography survive? Well, I don't know, but it's your

02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:38.660
turn to vote. There's the list in the chat room. Send a private message to sky with your

02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:43.300
vote with your number one and number two most wanted answer. Please label your one and two

02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:47.540
choices as one is worth more. So there you go. Send a private message. We'll tally them

02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:53.860
all up and we'll let you know the winners right after the mailbag loot Mara Marvel though.

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:56.780
As for now, we are going to go ahead and say goodbye, but thank you so much for playing

02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:00.500
with us tonight. No problem. I'm sorry. Half your list got eliminated, but that's what

02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:04.860
happens sometimes. Yeah, that's all right. You still did a great job and best of luck

02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:09.460
of course, with your other projects. Thank you very much. All right, take care. Bye guys.

02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:13.100
All right. Thank you. Of course to tear. She's filling in very last minute too. Cause I put

02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:17.620
this on Twitter like 30 minutes before. So there you go. What's with the slacking? Huh?

02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.060
Cause it's cause someone didn't have their show. Roll stories up till about 15 minutes

02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:30.580
before that. No, someone texted you hours ago and said blah, blah, blah, blah. All right.

02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:33.700
Let's move on. We have a few more stories for you guys and we're going to get to the

02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:43.620
mailbag Loki. Ah, fun stuff. Um, so rumors, I got to get into more rumors. Of course,

02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:49.220
you know, everybody's Jones in the sea. What the hell exactly is going to be a part of

02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:54.260
the new Wii system? And uh, there's a lot of speculation out there, a lot of unnamed

02:12:54.260 --> 02:13:00.660
sources and whatnot. So take this with a big grain of salt. But, um, apparently here's

02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:03.820
some of the rumors. Uh, they're saying that it's only going to have eight gigabytes of

02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:08.740
storage on board. Kind of think of it like the flash based storage that they had already.

02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:12.940
Um, they're saying it's going to be augmented though by SD card support. So kind of think

02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:16.420
of like the Wii was just a little bit bigger than eight gigabytes. You don't compare that

02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:23.020
to like say the Microsoft, um, you know, Xbox, the new system. Um, you know, that has four

02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:28.820
gigabytes built into some of them. So that's not too bad. Um, they're saying that the storage

02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:36.100
space is going to be on the actual disks. It's going to be using, um, some 25 gigabyte

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:42.140
disks are saying maybe like a single layer blu-ray disc. Um, although they're not really

02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:49.940
saying what type of disk format they're using. Also that, uh, the 10 ADP output is not necessarily

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:55.180
a definite. It might be, you know, lower than that, seven 20 or something. Um, honestly

02:13:55.180 --> 02:14:00.620
though, if they're going to be pushing visuals that are better than Sony and Microsoft, they

02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:05.620
really do need to do 10 ADP I think at the very least. Although they're saying that it

02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:16.380
might be 10 ADI. So I, I, come on, don't skimp on this shit. That's all I got to say. But

02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:21.020
of course we're not going to really know until the dam system comes out. So let's let the

02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:25.300
wait. All right. You just have to wait and see and wait one more month. Exactly. And

02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:33.540
then, um, I don't know. I'll be interesting. I have a feeling when I think of Nintendo

02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:37.940
announcing the system at during their press conference, all the only word that comes to

02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:45.100
my mind is disappointment. So I'm expecting disappointment. All right. Well there is some

02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:48.860
good news I guess to talk about. It does have to do with world of Warcraft, but this is

02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:53.140
good news. They have a released in the world of Warcraft store. They're little, I know

02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:57.100
you all love this word, but microtransaction store they've got going on, uh, between now

02:14:57.100 --> 02:15:02.820
and July 31st, if you buy their latest in game pet, which is the Sonarian hatchling,

02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:07.420
I believe cute. I believe it's based off an old, old Mount that was available at one time,

02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:11.300
but now it's a little pet. And if you buy this Mount or I'm sorry, excuse me, this pet

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:18.280
for $10, 100% of that $10 will be donated to the red crosses, Japan earthquake and Pacific

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.220
tsunami relief effort. Uh, there was a big call for blizzard to do something like this

02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:26.860
because obviously, you know, they've sold mounts and things like that strictly for profit

02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:27.860
before.

02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:31.820
They've also done sales where half the profits go to something. And I believe they recently

02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.000
said, uh, they sold the Moon King Moonkin hatchling patent not that long ago and they

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.940
gave half the proceeds to make a wish foundation. And I believe it raised $800,000. So imagine

02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:46.380
what a hundred percent of the proceeds you're going to raise for this very needed cause.

02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:50.020
I mean, even, even now, I mean, I realize you're not seeing it every day in the news,

02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:54.180
but that doesn't mean it was cleaned up overnight and everybody is suddenly, you know, all better.

02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:59.700
That's not how this works. So, uh, I'm glad there's continuing to do things for, uh, Japanese

02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:04.800
tsunami relief. That's great. And just the power of it's nice to see good news about

02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:12.420
games and plus just the power of a beast like world of Warcraft, you know, so very cool.

02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:16.340
All right, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag out

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:20.980
orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer likes to dive into the mailbag. Get your letters

02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:27.500
out and read them right here in the segment. The OLR mailbag. Um, just for the record,

02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:31.540
I'm not reading anything related to PlayStation at work. Uh, making that disclaimer ahead

02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:36.060
of time. Hey guys, it's blade three. I just wanted to say thanks for everything again.

02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:43.980
And if you could reprimands, I guess reprimand or completely extricated video game or company

02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:52.500
EG or Ubisoft and why you would do that. Okay. Wait, which company would we rep reprimand

02:16:52.500 --> 02:17:01.500
out of them? And if you could, I'm not getting the context on here. What are we reprimanding

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:07.900
them for? You've been very naughty. I have no idea. We do that all the time anyway. Thanks

02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:11.340
again guys. Keep up the fantastic work and Loki rock piece guys. This message brought

02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:16.500
to you by make employees I work with make rocks look like Einstein. Uh, we would reprimand

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:22.220
them all when they deserve it. That's, that's how these things work. Hey, OLR or OLF orange

02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:27.220
lounge video. Long time no type. I wanted to show you a picture of a Navajo taco. There's

02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:32.260
sometimes called Indian tacos. Is there a picture? Oh, this was a, this is a follow

02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:41.620
up to the email from last week. This image has been removed for security reasons. Owned

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:47.620
owned by the security filter taco. Hold on, hold on. There's an easy solution to this.

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:53.740
Watch. I'm going to go to google.com and I'm going to click on images and then I'm going

02:17:53.740 --> 02:18:02.380
to type na va ho taco. I'm going to hit enter and there it is. It's like a, Oh, this is

02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:06.460
like a Mexican pizza type of thing. But let me re finish reading this. Then you think

02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:11.640
of that taco bell entree, which is not the same. Okay, I get it. Fortunately, I couldn't

02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:15.300
find any pictures of a Navajo taco that I've made in the past, so I had to settle for one

02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:20.780
off google search. I am Navajo myself, so I make these quite often. Navajo tacos are

02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:26.340
similar to a normal taco with a few of exceptions. One, you use fry bread, sometimes called fried

02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:31.100
bread in place of the taco shell. It's not a Navajo taco without our, without fry bread.

02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:34.860
Two, beans are added, usually refried beans. They're really good and much bigger than a

02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:38.860
normal taco. Sometimes you can fold them, eat them like an actual taco. Some people

02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:43.620
use a fork and knife if they're too big. I usually eat them like a pizza. Oh Rob, your

02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:48.540
comparison was astute. When I introduce someone to a Navajo taco, they fall in love. If you

02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:54.020
want to try one of these, I suggest checking out the next powwow that might be in your

02:18:54.020 --> 02:19:00.860
area. You know what, now that you've mentioned it, I have had one before. I had one, um,

02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:07.620
in Alabama at the Creek Indian Powwow, but that's not what they were called. Okay. But

02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:10.460
you can find people making these tacos there most of the time. Don't get them from any

02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:14.380
carnival or fairs. They're not usually the best tasting there. That's all I wanted to

02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:23.740
share. I'll let you guys get back to gaming. Happy eating AJ twist of unfocused podcast.

02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:29.360
Well thank you for the email. And that Navajo taco did look yummy. I really, really freaking

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:39.300
want a taco, Rob. Alright. Okay. Uh, oh yeah, we already covered the, uh, well this comes

02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:45.940
from Rababa, but it's about the, uh, Smithsonian exhibit and I'm just going to skip the, uh,

02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:50.060
winners list and go right into the bulk of the email. I disagree with some of the choices

02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.260
which are moot points. The one I think is obviously a wrong pick is Pac-Man for the

02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:58.460
Atari 2600. I hope they critique about the lack of advanced techniques for graphics in

02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:03.220
the overly short development cycle for that game. Seriously, I hope that they show the

02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:07.900
progression of detail shifting from highly stylized artwork like on adventure or haunted

02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:14.300
house to in game art. I always kind of wish that they would make, that they'd make a new

02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:19.580
space invaders with the yeti like aliens throwing lightning bolts from the side of the arcade

02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:24.080
cabinet. I also hope they show the graphic art design on different publishers game boxes.

02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:36.740
I will definitely go see the exhibit. Pictures. Um, don't care. Sony's getting sued. Of course.

02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:42.340
Like I said, I'm not reading anything about the, um, PlayStation. Ho and Spazinator sends

02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:49.660
a follow up email. That's the one that, okay. The one on Monday he said not to read. Disregard

02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:58.380
it. Okay. I just had everything pulled up. Okay. Um, more about PlayStation. Sorry Rababa.

02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:02.820
Last email to Sky Dark Sakura and Loki. Have you ever bought a game just for the sake of

02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:06.940
having it? I mean, yeah, you bought the game to play it, but you bought it more for the

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:11.660
fact of having it for your collection than to actually play it. Thanks. Peace out Ranma.

02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:17.340
Good question. I have all the time. I got Dan, the Gunstar heroes on a Game Gear. I

02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:24.500
don't think he's opened it yet. I bought Metal Gear Solid four because I got it for a really

02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:29.360
good deal. I got it for 20 bucks when most places were still selling it for 50 at a radio

02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:33.900
shack that was, uh, on clearance with all their games in Hawaii nonetheless. And I've

02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:38.460
not played it to this day. I got a forgotten realms D and D game because it came with a

02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:44.920
game with a gaming module. It was a big PC one. At the first, um, loud. I bought collector's

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:48.520
editions of burning crusade and wrath of the Lich King. Granted the burning crusade one

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:52.900
was all autographed, but I gave it to someone for a Christmas present. And then I kept the

02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:57.060
wrath of Lich King one, which I actually still haven't even used because I already had it.

02:21:57.060 --> 02:22:02.980
So I just bought it for the, I actually do have my final fantasy 11 beta discs still.

02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:07.580
Nice. Yeah. Loki, anything you've ever bought just to have for your collection? Like, I

02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:17.180
don't know, a Japanese three years and not play it. Yeah. Um, well I bought like three

02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:27.020
copies of, uh, earth defense force, but there were cheap. Um, I've played this about once

02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:34.980
or twice. President cat. Nice. I want to borrow it. Sure. If we can get it to work on my system.

02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:43.140
Can't without a mod ship. Well, then she's going to have to borrow the, we do can't wife

02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:49.940
is playing animal crossing. Don't. All right. Uh, is that it for emails? That's it. Mailbag

02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:55.180
at orange lounge, radio.com. Now I know you're all dying to know the results of tonight's

02:22:55.180 --> 02:23:01.740
list lists, so let's get to the results. We have the definitive list. You guys, these

02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.620
are, this is it. These are the three things we want. Actually it's for tonight cause there

02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:10.820
was a tie, but these are the things that we demand for us to care about. PlayStation network

02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:17.100
when it comes back up online. Number three, a PlayStation two emulator download. That's

02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:22.000
the number three. Number two, it's a tie. The number two thing you most want that will

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.420
bring you back to PlayStation network. The clerks animated series back on the air and

02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:34.860
gay pornography. Yay porn. And the number one thing that could get you to come back

02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:43.460
and give a shit about PlayStation is if it were to morph into a dreamcast too. Yay. There

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:49.180
it is. The definitive list. Dream cats again. Number thing, PS two emulator. Number two,

02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:54.220
clerks and gay porn tie. And number, that's the only time you'll ever hear me say that.

02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:58.980
And number one, morphing the system into a dreamcast too. That's it. No arguing. We're

02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:06.780
done. Just something troubling went into my head. What? Clerk says a gay porn. Not funny.

02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:14.380
Black Wolf says I voted for lesbian porn. What's it? It's lady gay. Same diff. Gay with

02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:21.740
boobs. That's right. I'm moving on. These are all formalities. Uh, we're going to get

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:26.060
to the ranty part of the show. It's the part of the show we call the F use of the week.

02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:49.020
Rawr. Dark Sakura. Um, F you to me not having any tacos right now. I really want fish tacos

02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:53.580
from Carolina's, but I don't want to drive out and get them. I got you that last week.

02:24:53.580 --> 02:25:04.060
I know. I want, I really taco and finals freaking finals and four hour rendering and Maya bite

02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:14.860
my butt. Loki. Um, my head hurts. Guess if you have that, I guess the show makes your

02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:21.820
head hurt. Yes. Uh, my F you goes to myself for staying up until four 30 in the morning

02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:27.420
yesterday. I was driving home from the Bay area very late. That was kind of dumb, but

02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:31.980
I slept until noon today and that part was awesome. There we go. That's the F use of

02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:36.140
the week. Just a couple more stories for you guys. And then the Skype line, we're going

02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:40.740
to open it up at one eight seven seven game O L R or a username on Skype. Orange lounge

02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:46.660
radio will be open just after a couple more stories. Loki. Um, one of the things Nintendo,

02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:53.860
I guess was bad about for this generation of games was launching really big titles around

02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:58.780
when third parties are launching. They're really big titles, thus stealing away sales

02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:04.300
from these other third parties that they're working with. Um, apparently, you know, they

02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:08.060
were kind of stepping on their toes. So what they're doing now, at least they're promising

02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:14.980
to do is, um, that the three ds versions of super Mario and Mario cart, uh, they said

02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:18.300
they want other companies to be successful in order to accomplish this goal. They're

02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:23.980
going to dedicate or decide on dates after they know what the release plans of other

02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:28.000
companies are so that they can be considerate to them and so that they can all maximize

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:35.380
their sales, uh, for the short term. So that's kind of cool at least. How considerate. Yes.

02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:40.940
Um, well, I guess that's one way to help, you know, get third parties on board for your

02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:48.220
new system and it would not fucking them over like that. That'd be awesome. Awesome. All

02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:52.860
right, well, uh, one more story for you guys and it has to do with the useless peripheral.

02:26:52.860 --> 02:27:00.500
Yay. This is a peripheral by CTA digital and it's going to cost you $13. Guess what it

02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:09.460
is? It's a steering wheel for connect. You know, that's not as bad as the, the inflatable

02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:13.860
boat. That w that thing was fucking awesome. But uh, here it is. This is the coolest thing

02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:19.780
about it. It's translucent. It's a see through steering wheel because I guess with the connect,

02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:23.620
you don't want the connect to see the steering wheel. It's only going to see your hand. Okay.

02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:29.140
Who drives the steering wheel up at their face? I mean, are you, I'm not going to mention

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:32.900
anything because that's just only going to be racist if I do anything like that. I drive,

02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:37.380
I just drive with one hand on the steering wheel usually, but connect doesn't recognize

02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:42.540
that. I have to drive like a regular person like 10 and do you have to drive like you're

02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:50.820
a bad actor. Exactly. So there you go. Uh, make sure you preorder that right away. Hey,

02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:57.180
guess what folks, if you want to be able to do such things as drive without, you know,

02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:02.100
with a steering wheel peripheral, you know what you can do? You can get anything to act

02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:10.740
like a steering wheel, just a stick, a plate, you know, an actual steering wheel, a car,

02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:19.180
a kitten, you know, a taco. I mean, why do you need to buy? Oh my God. Dark soccer. They

02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:25.480
need to power video games with tacos. They need to power me with tacos. One eight seven

02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:30.340
seven game. O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. By the way, black

02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:34.200
wolf wants to clarify in the chat room. I tried playing joy ride using the Mario cart.

02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:39.020
We wheel and it didn't work, so that's why it's translucent. I see. Well, we'll trick

02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:42.580
those infrared beams after all. All right, the calls are coming in already. Hi, you're

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:47.220
on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's your local plug for Ronda. Of course. Of course

02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:50.860
you get in the Skype line first too. It's like you have a gift. All right, what's on

02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:56.420
your mind, buddy? Before I begin, I just got one thing to say, Rob. Yes. A blender, really

02:28:56.420 --> 02:29:02.460
a blender. What's wrong with the blender? This just proves to me that you have been

02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:10.700
listening to the show. I will confirm or deny nothing. Okay. I'm going to make this quick

02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:16.740
and so, and move it along. Okay. Yes. All right. First thing in response about Nintendo's

02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:23.260
next gen controller, I would be just happy if they just took the original super NES controller,

02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:28.820
put two analog sticks on there and a little touch screen and I'll be happy. Okay. Touch

02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:33.380
screen. I don't really see the point of that, but if you need a super Nintendo controller,

02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:38.260
two analog sticks, that'd be called the classic controller. That's all we need, but I can

02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:43.100
understand. I'd be happy with the super Nintendo controller with a fleshlight attachment. That's

02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:51.900
what I'd be happy with. Oh God. Nintendo's going to deliver an experience like never

02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:59.140
before. This is only adults only. Fuck you kids. We don't need you anymore. You said

02:29:59.140 --> 02:30:06.780
we were hard corn off. Well, fuck you. No, seriously. Fuck you. I'm waving the flag over

02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:16.940
here. It's the Nintendo fuck you coming up this Christmas. That's a pretty catchy name.

02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:33.340
Where were we? I'm sorry. See low green to sing the theme song. Oh God. Ah, yes. Oh,

02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:36.300
hold on. I'm sorry for the dead air here, but I'm setting something up here. Hold on.

02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:41.740
Here we go. Oh no. All right. Let's see here. If I can, uh, Oh God damn it. I can't. Okay.

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:49.100
Here we go. Ah, nevermind. The joke's derailed now. All right. What do you want? Oh, there

02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:59.060
we go. Coming this Christmas from Nintendo, the company that brought you such hardcore

02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:08.340
games as the legend of Zelda. It's the Nintendo fuck you. What were you talking about? Touch

02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:12.940
screens. But on retrospect of that, I said the next gen console should be called the

02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:18.500
Nintendo. Simple as that. Oh God. It's going to be some really retarded, like Nintendo

02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:27.560
HD or like, I mean, cause seriously the, the DS, the 3DS. I, um, I would, I, if they're

02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:32.900
going with this whole Facebook route, I would say it's going to be called Nintendo.com will

02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:41.180
be the name of this. Here's how it will be. The Nintendo HD. So HD, lowercase I, lowercase

02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:54.520
I. What? Get it? It's like the Wii. Nintendo HD. Oh, D. Oh, HD. Boy. Oh boy. What do they

02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:58.580
need to put in a Nintendo console to make you a really excited around my, or are you

02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:04.580
just excited on principle? I want more 2D Mario brothers cause I'm sick of the 3D Mario

02:32:04.580 --> 02:32:09.900
games. I'm sorry. I thought Mario 64 was great. And then I got tired of it. You mean to tell

02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:14.580
me I'm sitting here going through the level eight times to get these stars. That's it.

02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:20.760
I'm done. Nope. No more of that. Yeah. Well, what about all those people that are like

02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:26.580
Mario 64 is the best game ever made. I'm going to plead the fifth amendment on that one.

02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:33.380
Oh, that means, uh, I should play the Cielo song again. All right. Yes. All right. Well,

02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:37.540
any other thoughts for listeners tonight? Oh yeah. I did find out something that before

02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:41.520
Activision canceled the entire Guitar Hero franchise, they were actually working on one

02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:47.140
more game. Well now it could come back someday. They've left the door open a crack. They haven't

02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:52.060
shut the door on it completely. Yes. It's called Guitar Hero Grateful Dead edition.

02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:56.660
It comes with five songs, 20 minutes each and the collector's edition comes with a one

02:32:56.660 --> 02:33:01.420
pound bag of weed. I was going to say there's the punchline has to be like a pound of coke

02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:11.620
or a pound of weed. No Motley Crue version comes with a one pound bag of crack. And a

02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:23.580
straw. Now that's living the rock star experience. All right. On that note, Rama, we'll let you

02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:31.500
go. Bye. Take care. One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange launch

02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:35.460
radio, but there's already calls coming in. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:40.860
Good evening, OLR. This is blue swim. Hey, blue swim. What's on your mind, buddy? I was

02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:49.140
wondering if you guys heard about the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure. Is it is it interesting?

02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:55.020
I mean, well, I don't want to sound rude, but like, you know, we tried to get all the

02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:00.100
details a couple of months ago and weren't very successful. It was kind of like trying

02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:06.980
to I don't know. All right. Well, what's the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure? Actually,

02:34:06.980 --> 02:34:14.820
it is going mobile. Oh, OK. Yeah, I seem to remember something about the whole thing where

02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:19.260
they were going to. Yeah, I remember him saying he was trying to strike deals with people

02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:23.540
like Android and iPhone and all that stuff. So it's going mobile, huh? Yeah. Looks to

02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:31.060
be iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Windows seven phone with Android to follow. And it looks

02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:37.740
like it's going to come out on June seventh. Wow. Ninety nine cents. Didn't say anything

02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:46.140
about price, but it's going to have new levels, new music, new features, and the Xbox version

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:51.780
is going to get it as well. Oh, interesting. So they're going to upgrade the existing one

02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:57.060
or there's going to be an all new one. From what I'm seeing, it looks like it will be

02:34:57.060 --> 02:35:01.700
upgrading the original on the Xbox Live indie games. Nice, because I already bought that

02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:04.780
one, so that would be cool. By the way, if you've never played Techno Kitten Adventure,

02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:08.220
it's a disgustingly simple game. You play a kitten that's flying through the air to

02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:11.980
techno music and you just don't want to hit a wall or you'll hear a little meow. Actually,

02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:14.860
I should fire up a clip. It's been a couple months, right? We're all ready to hear the

02:35:14.860 --> 02:35:19.420
song again, right? Hell yeah. Let me fire up YouTube here. Now, where did you read about

02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:24.540
this? On his official website, do you subscribe to the dude's blog? Actually, I saw it on

02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:28.900
his Twitter on the official Techno Kitten Adventure Twitter feed. I think it's I can

02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:33.420
has kitten or something like that. All right. And it's linking to an article on no gamer

02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:38.420
left behind. All right. Well, here you go. If you have never played Techno Kitten Adventure

02:35:38.420 --> 02:35:56.740
before, then you're missing out on this. I just blew some. I just couldn't believe that

02:35:56.740 --> 02:36:00.460
guy made this game because that guy, when we interviewed him, sound like he'd been playing

02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:09.340
a lot of Grateful Dead, Guitar Hero, if you know what I mean. Yeah. I mean, have you seen

02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:17.820
the news, a new screenshot? I haven't. I love you. No, I haven't seen a new screenshot.

02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:26.380
Where are they? I retweeted it on my Twitter feed. Twitter, twitter.com slash blue swim.

02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:33.060
B plug. Cheap plug. Yes, I know. I'm a graduate of the Mick Foley School of Cheap Pops. Yes.

02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:36.460
I don't see it yet. It hasn't popped up yet. Hold on. I'm waiting. Wait, just now you did

02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:42.820
or? Oh, no, I see. I see. Oh, there it is. A few days ago. Okay. New screenshots. Oh,

02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:49.300
now there's pink dolphins and more rainbows. Quadruple rainbow. What does it mean? Also,

02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:55.940
there is a little blimp in the screen and I thought at first it said fart on the blimp,

02:36:55.940 --> 02:37:00.260
but it actually says party. It's just a little marquee that's scrolling and it looked like

02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:03.860
it said fart, but I'd laugh if there was a blimp that randomly flew across the screen

02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:09.020
and said fart. It looks like the visuals are better. Oh, sure. I'm sure they've had chance

02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:13.740
to touch it up, but it's not as cool as, uh, what was it? That one kitten that flies around

02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:21.620
the rainbow and has annoying song with it. Same game. No, I don't know. Oh, the unicorn

02:37:21.620 --> 02:37:28.660
adventure. No, no, the maim. Oh, I don't remember. All right. The one that's like, yeah, I forget

02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:35.100
the song. It was one that was super important. The portal lines. All right. Well, blue swim,

02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:39.820
do you have any other things you want to share with us tonight? Um, I think that's about

02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:45.460
it. All right. Well, um, enjoy techno kitten adventure and uh, you know, don't do drugs.

02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:50.260
Hey, I don't. I haven't done them for 24 years and I'm looking to keep that streak going.

02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:55.460
All right. Good. All right. Take care. You too. Good night guys. I know he probably doesn't

02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:59.700
do drugs, but I'm just, I'm just saying. All right. Uh, Oh, they're saying that they should

02:37:59.700 --> 02:38:04.780
make a, uh, a game out of Nyan cat. Is that the, what you were thinking of earlier? Nyan

02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:08.980
cat. All right. Nyan cat. That's what it is. All right. One eight seven seven game. O L

02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:14.940
R or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio. And if you're like one of the two people

02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:21.300
on the internet who hasn't seen it, here it is just for Loki. I have seen it, but that's

02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:27.020
what I'm saying. That's much cooler than techno kitten adventure. Like, can you imagine a

02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:32.020
game based off that one April fools? I just want to do the whole show with this in the

02:38:32.020 --> 02:38:44.380
background. It's pretty awesome. Admit it. You're singing along now. Hey, Thomas Howard,

02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:52.300
singing over that. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on a orange launch radio. Who's

02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:57.940
this? Yeah, it's like, Hey, what's on your mind, buddy? Uh, nothing much. Just like trying

02:38:57.940 --> 02:39:04.020
to like get all my chilling and relaxing before work tomorrow. But more importantly, trying

02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:10.980
to see if I could compare two, two parallels for you, you know, in terms of what I've heard

02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:15.620
last night and what I'm seeing, you know, what I've seen this weekend, case in point,

02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:22.380
Konami basically stagnating on DDR and Activision whoring out Call of Duty and Guitar Hero and

02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:28.340
basically any franchises that touch it. And to that point, it's like, the way I see it

02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:33.380
is that the only way Konami could really dig that franchise out of the, out of the grave

02:39:33.380 --> 02:39:38.860
more or less is that they have, they have to move beyond the four arrows. I know some

02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:42.660
people are just going to be, they're basically going to eat me alive for what I'm saying.

02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:47.380
But if you look at the way harmonics managed to take advantage of connect and run with

02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:53.900
it, it's pretty apparent that physical, physical controls are no longer, they no longer apply.

02:39:53.900 --> 02:40:03.140
As long as the camera is able to do all the work for you. You agree? Um, so you think

02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:07.540
that the cameras should just do everything and that there's no need for a dance pad anymore?

02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:12.180
Well, it's not even that. It's just like the, they need more modern controls. Like if you're

02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:19.100
still, if you're still relying on, you know, on a panel with four sensors to actually register

02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:24.860
input, then, then you're still stuck in the past when people have arms and legs that you

02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:31.140
should be able to capture either through like through the camera or some other panel that

02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:34.380
doesn't have any like intricate parts like that.

02:40:34.380 --> 02:40:38.700
Even DDR kind of tried the whole like arms and legs thing before though. I feel like

02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:43.340
every DDR game does something with the gimmicks. Yeah. Once again, they just, it's not even

02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:48.860
gimmicky in the sense you have to like, if you look at how dance central is only like,

02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:53.140
you're only, you're standing up while dancing, essentially. If you were able to create a

02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:57.620
version, you know, a feature dancing game that not only did that, we're allowed to do

02:40:57.620 --> 02:41:01.940
break dancing moves, which is like really, really wishful thinking I'm pulling out right

02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:06.900
now. That would be a killer feature. Now, why don't we just give them the choice, you

02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:11.100
know, to choose between doing it. And now I understand that Konami's kind of, eh, when

02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:16.060
it comes to emulating stuff. They're basically taking the same thing, applying the same methods

02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:23.660
and expecting different results. That my friends is insanity. I mean, something has to give

02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:29.300
because at this point, I mean, I somewhat care about DDR, but it's not important anymore.

02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:34.700
I've moved on in that sense ever since CF closed back home in New York city is just

02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:42.220
like, it doesn't matter. I wouldn't give two shits right now, but I mean, other people

02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:48.160
may, you know, you know, may feel different. I mean, but that's them. And that's because

02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.500
they're still holding on. I mean, I haven't even been on a dance. Last time I was on a

02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:57.740
dance pad was a few weeks ago. And before that month, it's like, I'm going without like

02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:02.180
DDR for, you know, at this point, it's just, you know, I couldn't, I'm fine. It won't kill

02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:07.780
me if I don't, if I don't play. Not that a day, but the bottom line is this, you know,

02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:13.620
for one company to try to, try to revive a franchise by constantly doing the same thing

02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:18.300
that got them there in the first place without innovating, it's, it's not going to look good

02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:23.460
for them. And I'm going on Activision's point where this is what happened to Guitar Hero.

02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:25.180
And this is what will happen to Call of Duty.

02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:30.620
Well, let me, let me ask you a question. Isn't it okay to let the franchise die? I mean,

02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:35.740
like for example, combat on the Atari 2600, you know what? It's just, it's just done it.

02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:39.180
There's never going to be another one. Let's just let it be. I mean, is it okay to just

02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:43.900
say, you know what? It's, we don't need DDR anymore. We have stuff like Dance Central

02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:48.820
or we have other dance games. I mean, can't we just let bygones be bygones, so to speak?

02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:53.940
I guess what they need to, what Konami needs to do is like, maybe, I don't know if they

02:42:53.940 --> 02:43:00.100
should retire the, the, the series, but try to move on, you know, try to move it on with

02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:05.980
a more spiritual, more of a spiritual, spiritual successor. Something that really isn't DDR,

02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:08.420
but it's the next evolution in that, in that whole genre.

02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:10.940
Well, isn't that supposed to be what Dance Masters is?

02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:16.500
Yeah, but that one was a rush job. It was, they didn't really think it out because it

02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:21.380
was just a simple grab for, for money by the time, you know, as a, as a Kinect launch title.

02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:24.660
I mean, now that it's already, now the cat's already out of the bag, you really,

02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:26.540
I know the cat is out of the bag.

02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:31.820
I mean, Konami really needs to take a good look at what, you know, what they can do to

02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:36.860
differentiate themselves from the competition and still be, still be profitable. I know

02:43:36.860 --> 02:43:42.340
it's a, it's a Herculean task, but I mean, it worked for harmonics in trying to, you

02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:47.540
know, to win over Guitar Hero folks in a rock band. Cause that one, you know, the innovation

02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:51.980
right there was just, you know, add more, add more peripherals. And from there, add

02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:56.940
more DLC and so forth and try to bring more realism into that experience, trying to bring

02:43:56.940 --> 02:44:01.020
an experience into the, into their living rooms or in an arcade.

02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:03.420
We got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but do you have any final thoughts

02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:04.420
for us tonight?

02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:11.340
Um, let's see, uh, PSN is probably, the way I see PSN is like, they, they, they're going

02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:16.180
to need more than a prayer. They're kind of done if they're completely compromised.

02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:19.980
All right, Zaku. Well, thank you so much for the call. Have a good one.

02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:20.980
Have a good one.

02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:21.980
Meow.

02:44:21.980 --> 02:44:26.060
All right. 1-877-GAMO-LR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. If you want to

02:44:26.060 --> 02:44:30.860
give us a call, though, I don't know if we'll get any calls after that. All right. Uh, let's

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:34.980
see. Kaijuto in our chat room says they need to put guns in DDR. That will save it.

02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:42.300
I could figure out a way to do that, but, uh,

02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:46.580
Two step in, one steps out.

02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:55.180
No, I, I, I agree with, um, you know, the fact that they just didn't really implement

02:44:55.180 --> 02:45:00.580
a lot of things well. And I think Dance Masters could be good. It's just they didn't do it

02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:05.900
right the first time around. There's a lot of things that they, glaring omissions that

02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:10.660
she, you know, Hey, you know, it'd be fun. It's a way to learn those routines instead

02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:16.020
of having to play them over and over and over again and fail. That might be cool. You know,

02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:21.920
with the Torioma or some sort of indicator what's coming up next. Uh, you know, so dark

02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:28.180
to is suggesting just putting the end cat in DDR. All right. There. DDR kittens, dance

02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:31.260
kitten adventure. That's what's going to save the game. All right. We're gonna close up

02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:34.620
the Skype lines and someone else is calling. It's after nine anyway. So let's go around

02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:37.740
and get everybody's a final thought. Actually, I didn't get any last minute stories. We were

02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:42.220
doing call after call there. So do you a dark soccer won't start us then? Well, apparently

02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:48.900
Stephen Colbert is part of the noble team. Well, not actually. Um, he, this actually

02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:55.900
comes from a joke that he made about, um, master chief being one of the, uh, original

02:45:55.900 --> 02:46:03.620
members of seal team six. And so, uh, bungee pulled off the image and put him on, uh, an

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:11.860
armored body. It's, it's just a mock up. It's not real, but it was pretty funny. And then,

02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:15.500
um, there was a quote going around saying that valve was getting rid of single player

02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:20.700
games, but really they're invoking single player plus to where you have social interactivity

02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:30.220
in your first in your one player games. All right. Uh, Loki, you have any final stories

02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:35.260
for earth last minute stories for us tonight? Yeah, real quick. Um, we, I think I mentioned

02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:39.780
this back a while ago. There was an indie game that was coming out on the Xbox in the

02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:46.540
marketplace, uh, that kind of combined almost think of it like a DDR meets a puzzle quest,

02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:50.940
but, uh, it's out now. Actually it's called sequence and definitely check it out. There's

02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:55.740
basically three different screens that are available that you switch between. Kind of

02:46:55.740 --> 02:47:03.780
think of like the rock band, PSP and DS version. Um, and then you, you know, tap up the sequences.

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:09.180
Um, and one of them, I think it's like for health regeneration, one's a defense and others

02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:14.140
like a magic or attack or something like that. So, um, check it out. It's available right

02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:21.300
now for $3 or 240 Microsoft points and the title sequence. Um, and then of course it

02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:25.780
was announced this week that, uh, Nintendo is dropping the price of the we bundle to

02:47:25.780 --> 02:47:30.100
one 50 even though it was like rumored. Um, so all we systems are now going to be one

02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:36.140
50. They're also putting out a new we bundle that's going to be with Mario cart. Um, and

02:47:36.140 --> 02:47:40.140
of course the emotion, uh, are we remote plus and that kind of stuff that available in black

02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:45.020
and white. And they're also going to be selling we sports separate because obviously this

02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:49.300
does not come with we sports. If you ask me, it's kind of a rip off because instead of

02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:55.620
getting two games for one 50 you're getting one game for one 50. Um, and you know, you

02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:58.800
kind of think, let me guess they dropped the price of we sports resort, but it's still

02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:04.940
kind of a rip off I think. Um, and then of course they also announced that they're going

02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:11.140
to be doing a line of, um, titles are going to be cheaper. Nintendo selects. Um, and the

02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:16.420
first lineup for the U S would be, and of course in the city folk, Mario's super sluggers,

02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:21.700
we sports and Zelda twilight princess. Where the fuck is the love for excite truck is what

02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:27.660
I got to ask, but you know, whatever. And then finally also, uh, in the UK they're going

02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:30.880
to be doing the Nintendo selects as well. Uh, they're going to have a little bit different

02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:36.420
of a lineup, uh, starting with a we sports course. So why are you aware smooth moves,

02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:45.420
which is a pretty awesome game, animal crossing, um, and Mario's strikers, uh, charge their

02:48:45.420 --> 02:48:52.700
football game over there. And then, uh, I mentioned this on my Twitter feed earlier.

02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:57.980
Nintendo has conceded that they have struggled with online on the we and I promise to improve

02:48:57.980 --> 02:49:02.740
it with the next system. Oh, Nintendo. Oh, and you didn't have to. Yes. So it's honestly

02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:07.420
speaking the we's future could have been different if Nintendo had made better partnerships with

02:49:07.420 --> 02:49:11.340
outside companies in the field of network services at early stages of penetration of

02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:19.420
the we penetration. Uh, in other words, Nintendo might have been a little obsessed with, uh,

02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:28.380
the policy. Uh, yeah. So, all right. Well, if that does it for last minute stories, yes.

02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:31.180
Then we're going to go around and get her base of final thoughts. First off, we want

02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:34.700
to thank you guys for downloading and listening to orange lounge radio this week or tuning

02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:38.740
in live, whatever the case may be. Uh, all we ask, we don't really play commercials except

02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:43.380
for, you know, other podcasts, but, uh, we don't, uh, make any money off this show. All

02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:47.680
we ask, tell two friends about the show, help us spread the word. Uh, even if you don't

02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:50.760
know who to tell, you could leave us a nice review on iTunes. We've had some wonderful

02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:54.140
five star reviews in the past couple of weeks. Really appreciate those. They really do go

02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:59.020
a long way in helping us get visibility and continue to spread the word of Nyan cat being

02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:02.940
played over phone calls. Uh, dark soccer. Do you have a final thought for our listeners

02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:10.700
tonight? I really freaking want a taco. My final thought is, uh, I'm going to just go

02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:15.740
get a taco. That's what I'm going to do. Don't make stinky face at me. Uh, Loki, your final

02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:24.380
thought. I joined Mensa and all I got was this membership card and discounts off Geico.

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:28.820
It's official. You're smart. All right. That's it everybody. Have a wonderful week. We are

02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:33.060
done for the night, but, uh, yeah. Uh, have a good one. We'll see you next week. We'll

02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:38.940
be back to do it all again. So, uh, join us. Bye. You've been listening to orange lounge

02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:46.140
radio. Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show. Visit

02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:54.740
www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time. The views and opinions expressed on

02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:59.820

02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:23.060
radio or all games.com, but we're probably right anyway. See you next week. All right.

02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:28.300
So something special after the credits tonight here on OLR, uh, because mostly I'm an idiot

02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:33.060
and I forgot to play this earlier in the show, but, uh, of course today is mother's day in

02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:37.100
the United States and I will, and I believe other countries too, but I want to say a very

02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:42.340
happy mother's day to all the mommies out there. Uh, all the motherly figures or whoever

02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:46.740
is considered a mother in your life. I want to say a happy mother's day to everybody.

02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:50.220
And you know, once in a while here on the show, we like to do like, you know, like a

02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:53.860
phone call to mom. So I think a couple of years ago we called dark soccer's mom. We

02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:56.500
called my mom before. I think even Loki's mom's probably been on the show at some point

02:51:56.500 --> 02:52:01.420
or another. So, um, tonight, uh, I wanted to give you guys an extra surprise and this

02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:05.380
is a very special thing for you guys that have listened through the whole thing. You've

02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:08.960
either stayed up very late with us live or you've listened through the entire podcast.

02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:15.560
But I promised you at some point I would have my mother review mortal combat. And so I have

02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:20.640
a clip of my mother watching me play mortal combat. And she actually said, if you put

02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:25.040
the video on the internet, I will kill you. However, she didn't say I couldn't play the

02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:29.820
audio for you guys on my radio show. Tell your mom, who's going to tell my mom. So here

02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:35.000
it is. Who's going to tell Rob's mom? This is the first time my mother watched us play

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:40.260
mortal combat. And just for the record, it was Molina versus striker. Here we go. Okay,

02:52:40.260 --> 02:52:44.540
so I'm here with my mommy. You know, your, your hair looks fine. Say hi to the internet,

02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:52.900
you're fine. You look fine. Okay. How are you doing? I'm fine. So we wanted to show

02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:56.580
you a video game. It's a new video game that came out. It's called mortal combat. Have

02:52:56.580 --> 02:53:02.460
you ever heard of it? Yeah. And what do you know of it? It's violent. And what do you

02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:09.140
think about violence in games? I think it's pathetic. Why? Because it teaches little kids

02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:14.220
to be violent, but can't you like supervise little kids? Didn't I play mortal combat when

02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:22.460
I was a kid? No, I supervise kids, but a lot of parents don't. Okay. Well, we just wanted

02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:25.900
to show you the new game and see what you think of the graphics and the technology.

02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:36.940
Look at her. She's not even dressed. That's disgusting. I need a comment about that. Yeah.

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:45.980
Her nipples aren't in the right place. If they were, you could see them. Look at her.

02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:56.060
She's an Amazon. Oh my God. They threw her around. So do you think stage fatality Rob

02:53:56.060 --> 02:54:06.820
or the uh, I would do her normal one. Is that blood all over the stage? Yep. Oh my God.

02:54:06.820 --> 02:54:17.900
She hit him right in the cahoots. What's your name? Melina. What is that she has on? There's

02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:29.060
some places missing. This, this is a game that's rated PG 17, right? It's rated M for

02:54:29.060 --> 02:54:52.300
amateur. Oh, it should be rated. She's giving them kisses. Kids have no threshold for violence.

02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:58.780
That's why, because they're conditioned that way. You got it. So after you beat the guy,

02:54:58.780 --> 02:55:24.620
you get to, here's the best part. She's going to take his head off. Oh my God. I knew it.

02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:35.580
Look at her outfit. What'd you think? It's disgusting. There you go. I love your mom.

02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:39.860
My mother reacting to the regular outfit or was it like the tape outfit? It was no, it

02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:43.540
wasn't the tape outfit. It was a regular little hoochie mama outfit there. Cause the tape

02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:48.340
outfits is worse. We hadn't unlocked that yet. We haven't gotten to the top of the tower.

02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:53.000
I think Alan's on like challenge 120 or something. So there you go. My mother's seeing Mortal

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:57.340
Kombat for the very first time. Her nipples are in the wrong place. You know how my mom's

02:55:57.340 --> 02:56:01.740
like way more concerned with the outfit than anything else. Love it. Love you mom. Don't

02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:04.620
be mad that I put this on my show. You said I couldn't do the video. I didn't put the

02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:07.940
video up. I'm not going to put it on YouTube. There it is. I just like that you could totally

02:56:07.940 --> 02:56:14.460
hear the in the background. I was like, Oh, I know what's going on. It's head eating time.

02:56:14.460 --> 02:56:18.900
All right. That really does bring it into the podcast tonight. Uh, for those of you

02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:21.780
guys listening live, stay tuned. But for those of you guys on the podcast, this really is

02:56:21.780 --> 02:56:23.220
the end. Have a wonderful night, everybody.
