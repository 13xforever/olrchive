0	19840	Today, May 8th, 2011, Sony is on Day 18 of PlayStation Network Outage, has a dev kit
19840	25000	for the next Xbox when spotted in a game developer, and Club Nintendo makes a controversial change
25000	32880	to their privacy policy. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello, my friends out there on the internet
32880	37440	and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It's the show where every gamer
37440	41160	has a voice. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours here
41160	47200	live with my co-host with me. Of course, the one, the only, the awesome DarkStalker, Jamie
47200	53440	Summers. Heck yeah. How are you doing? Awesome. And also very humble, might I add. Heck yeah.
53440	58400	All right. Well, happy Mother's Day to you. What? You're a mommy to Shermy, the kitty.
58400	62840	Oh yeah. Well then happy Mother's Day to you too. Oh, well thank you very much. I appreciate
62840	68240	it. All right. Also joining us tonight, Tech Master, Loki. Hi. And please pass along a
68240	72280	happy Mother's Day to the Mrs. Forest. I will do that. So how are you doing, Loki? I'm doing
72280	76880	fine. I see you're chugging along there on Portal 2. Yes, I am. So awesome. I beat a
76880	82360	game this week. I beat Portal 2. That's a huge landmark for me, you guys, because I
82360	85000	have the worst. If you listen to this show for any length of time, you know, I have the
85000	90760	worst gaming ADD in the world. I play a game for literally five minutes. Then I'm like,
90760	94560	ooh, Shiny, another game. I'll go play that. I mean, there's so much out there to play.
94560	98360	There's so many games that come out every week. I mean, not just like, you know, in
98360	103080	retail, but you have the download games that are available. Well, you know, we're available
103080	108240	on one console. And you know, so on and so forth. There's just so much to play. PC and
108240	112940	so on. I don't always get around everything. But yeah, I actually played Portal 2 to completion
112940	120360	and beat it. Yay. So I feel accomplished. I don't know why. Also, it's short. That helps.
120360	126200	Rob. What? The potato is not a lie. I don't want to spoil it because I know there's some
126200	131440	people that still haven't played it. I have to say the ending. Well, I lulled at the very,
131440	135600	very, very, very end. But for the rest of it, I was kind of like, oh, that's it? I was
135600	138320	kind of, oh, I thought there was going to be a little bit more, but I think something
138320	143000	in my head, I made up a plot point in my head that didn't come to fruition. And I think
143000	147440	that's why it was a little bit like, oh, I see. I was a little let down because I wasn't
147440	150600	right on that point. I was right on everything else. But then when the other thing didn't
150600	155320	come true, I was like, oh, I guess I can't tell the future after all. All right. Anyhow,
155320	159260	join us in our chat room, chat.orangelandrado.com as we do tape live every Sunday night at
159260	164100	six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at all games radio, www.allgames.com right
164100	167800	after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We got a lot of gaming news tonight. We're going to
167800	171740	get into a list list in part B tonight that will be themed around of course the big, big
171740	176400	story and so much more in just a little while. But first let's get into how we always start
176400	180780	the show off. How was your gaming week? Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week? I played
180780	187920	Portal 2 and got very sick and actually threw up this time. And I played some World of Warcraft.
187920	194840	And in World of Warcraft, I played Bejeweled, which I think it broke on me because it stopped
194840	200160	letting me fail for real because it's supposed to actually drop enough blocks that eventually
200160	204280	it just, the game will crash on you. Well, not crash, but the game will just end because
204280	208520	you don't have any more moves. And that never happened. So finally I just said, forget it
208520	216560	and went to bed. And then I played Peggle. Yay, Peggle. Yes, I love Peggle. They haven't
216560	221940	done anything with Peggle in a while. It seems like there was the coming to E3 super Peggle.
221940	228960	There was the one that came out with a portal to the valve edition was like extreme Peggle.
228960	233080	It's a freebie on steam. I don't remember that one. I think I missed it. Like a little
233080	237800	like 10 level Peggle, but it's fun. I played the Peggle in wow. I played that too. There
237800	241840	hasn't been a pop cap wow marriage in a while. Well, I mean, I guess there was the peace
241840	247320	bloom versus ghouls or whatever. Cause I haven't done that. Oh, it's in a Hillsbrad mountains.
247320	251760	Do you know where Taran Mill is? It's not far from there. Yeah. I've been going around
251760	257400	actually looking for Easter eggs. Like the one I sent you. Did you get it? I did. I figured
257400	261320	we haven't had that one pop up. So I've been going around looking for all the different
261320	265560	Easter eggs. And the next thing I'm going to do is try to get into the, uh, the troll
265560	270160	crypt because you can still do it, but you can't do it the way you used to be able to
270160	274960	do it. You know what I'm talking about? I think so. Yes. With the upside down centers.
274960	278480	What you should do is you should go for your Explorer achievement if you don't already
278480	282000	have it. Cause it forces you to kind of visit the whole world. I've already got it on, um,
282000	292440	ERISA. Okay. Well, except I don't have the, um, the, uh, uh, yes. All the cataclysm one
292440	299600	yet because I skipped the under the underwater kingdom and I've just recently gone back and
299600	305040	so I could get my, uh, exalted with them. And now I'm just like, people take me on heroics
305040	307880	please. Well, I don't want to turn this too much into the wild show cause I already have
307880	311360	a spinoff show for a while, but I do want to quickly say, um, you know, just, just even
311360	314340	today you do find new stuff in the game once in a while. And that's kind of the fun thing
314340	317880	about a virtual world, no matter what MMO you play. I think this can really be expanded
317880	322200	to any MMO out there. Rift, Star Trek, whatever it is you play. It's always fun to sometimes
322200	326320	go just go explore and like find new things. Like even just today, salacious pop was like,
326320	330560	Hey Rob, I, I, I see this house here I've never seen before. That's kind of, it's not
330560	334840	really on the map or anything. It's just like up here in the hill. And this guy wants junk
334840	337600	boxes. I can't figure out what he's for. So it was just, you know, sometimes you find
337600	341600	random stuff. Did you find the place where the animals have weapons? No. Where's that?
341600	344920	There's um, I'll find it during the course of show, but there's a place that's like the
344920	348380	only way you can get there is if you have a flying mount. And I think at the part that
348380	351800	you're normally there, you don't have one. I think actually if I'm right, I think it's
351800	357120	the Tauran starting area, but it's one place up at the top of the map that you can only
357120	362280	get there with a flying mount. And then randomly different animals are wearing helmets. Okay.
362280	368720	The prairie dogs wear helmets and carry knives. The rabbits carry battle axes and the rats
368720	374000	wear skull helmets and carry two double barreled shotguns. That's kind of awesome. And they
374000	377480	get bigger and then all of a sudden they'll shrink down and go to normal size. And I'm
377480	381720	also going to try to wake up early in the morning and do the gold jar children thing.
381720	386340	The only Easter, the only Easter egg area I've really explored was the one, it's right
386340	390240	outside Stormwind. It's up in the Hills and there's all these sheep, just tons and tons
390240	393840	of sheep that you can kill for the critter achievement. And if you kill them all though,
393840	398760	the guy comes out of his house and he goes, what's wrong with you? That's just wrong.
398760	403120	He starts yelling at you about what a bastard you are. There's another place, but you kill
403120	408040	them. There's another place that has, um, and this will be the end of it, but this one
408040	414160	was one I thought was really nice is there's a monument and a dwarf in red named Roush
414160	421360	kneeling in front of it. And it reads, uh, rest in peace, Anthony T. Stark. People were
421360	424040	calling that the iron man thing, but it's not. It's actually for a guy who was a friend
424040	431000	of the developers and Roush was his character, the dwarf. So they made him an NPC. Very cool.
431000	435300	I thought it was a nice gesture and the smiley face. I'll say this about another MMO, Final
435300	438480	Fantasy 11. You know, I played that for many years before I played. Wow. One of the things
438480	442080	I used to really like about that is that I really liked the ambience of that game. You
442080	445600	know what? The graphics are more first person. I mean, they can be third person depending
445600	449480	on how you play, but I just really liked exploring areas in that game because there were some
449480	454440	really beautiful areas and great music. And because of the way the game was designed,
454440	459620	you wouldn't always like see every area for a long time. So as you were progressing, which
459620	462840	could sometimes take months and months, you would find these new areas and hear new music
462840	467900	and it was just really cool. I mean, it was a frustrating ass grind. That's why I was
467900	474920	so disappointed that 14 was such crap. I mean, sorry to say, I don't know what's going to
474920	478400	happen to 14. We haven't heard of what's going on there in a while. I don't know if they're
478400	484660	going to try to reboot or what. I don't know. Like a sliver in my pinky, the extra part
484660	489000	of my pinky nail. I'd like to come back and make it like really awesome, but I don't know.
489000	493520	I think it might be a lost cause at this point. Anyhow, just update 11 with new graphics and
493520	498240	stuff and that's all you need to do. The game's awesome and not as pain in the ass of the
498240	502720	grind. They did change a lot of stuff in 11 since you and I left. Like the level sinking
502720	507720	thing is huge and you know, but there's only so much you can like cram into an old engine
507720	512520	and that's where Warcraft starting to have that problem. Much different outfits. Seriously.
512520	516520	There's so many different armors that change your look in world of Warcraft, but really
516520	523280	in Final Fantasy 11, it's just like, oh, I'm wearing the bondage gear. Oh, now I'm wearing
523280	529840	white mage robes. They're just very few new things and you can tell what anybody is by
529840	534160	looking at them. And the other problem 14 had was that it tried to change it up too
534160	538920	much. Like instead of being just a white mage and a black mage, now you could be a gladiator
538920	544120	or a Theramaterge. Like what? That's not why I play Final Fantasy to be a fucking Theramaterge.
544120	548680	Seriously, what is the point of having the same races but changing the names? Yeah, that
548680	553160	was retarded. Silly. Anyway. Okay. Enough fan memo ranting. Let's talk about other guys.
553160	559760	By the way, I must say that my wife's character, well, before she had the hairdo change, but
559760	564560	she looked like Mel's Tarot Tarot at one point. Actually, no, she does look like Mel's Tarot
564560	568340	Tarot now. Wait, wait, your wife had a Final Fantasy 11 character? No, I'm saying she's
568340	572840	playing Animal Crossing. Her character in Animal Crossing looks like Mel's little Tarot
572840	580600	Tarot because Mel looked like a little grandma. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always cracked me up. Awesome.
580600	583600	There are those days, like I'll see those sales on Steam where it's like, Final Fantasy
583600	588800	11 is only $20 for the uber mega OMG I can't believe it version. And I'm like, I kind of
588800	594640	want to go back. I kind of want to go back. Resist, resist. I will. I will. Alright, anyhow.
594640	599200	Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing? Only really three things.
599200	603680	Wait, more importantly, the chat room wants to know for the betting pool tonight, what
603680	611240	food did you bring to the show? Uh, I brought a Carl's Jr. Western burger. There you go.
611240	614760	I don't think anyone guessed Carl's Jr. We got a lot of losers in chat tonight. I don't
614760	619120	normally get Carl's Jr. Every now and then I get Western. It was today. It was like I
619120	625040	had a big burger for lunch and I didn't really know what I wanted to get. So I just picked
625040	628680	up something because I, you know, if I didn't eat anything, I'd be hungry, but I didn't
628680	632840	feel like anything. I almost brought nothing. I almost just had red bulls and it bought
632840	636560	the wrong size red bull too. So these are like a red bull and a half. I'm still gonna
636560	640600	drink two of them though. I had a red bull last night cause I was up until four 30. It's
640600	645720	still the color of pee. It is, but it keeps you awake. I don't care. It makes my brain
645720	650880	function. All right. Video games. What have you been playing this week? Break man in our
650880	655640	chat asks, what's a Carl's Jr. If you're on the East coast, I think they call it Hardee's.
655640	663040	Hardee's. Anyways, um, I played portal two, a lot of portal two and progressing nicely
663040	669440	through it. See, I started off on the 360, but I decided, you know, okay, here's, here's
669440	675600	that window. And I don't know if you'd, it's not technically piracy because I do own a
675600	682800	copy of it. Just, I'm not playing the copy that I bought. Um, so I have the 360 copy.
682800	688560	I have the PS3 copy that I got for free through my work, which has the PC steam copy. But
688560	693900	as you know, PlayStation network is down, so I can't download my steam copy. So I pirated
693900	700040	the PC copy and I'm playing that. So technically I own it on PC. I just am not playing that
700040	706200	copy, but who cares? I'm enjoying it just fine on my laptop cause it runs very, very
706200	713960	great. I can max out everything and um, let's see. And then I've been playing actually with
713960	719000	my 360 controller, which is awesome. It was kind of a headache to get it to work. Well
719000	721840	originally it was a headache, but until I figured out they have to have the controller
721840	727040	turned on before you start the game. Now it works just fine. You know, it's the only game
727040	733360	that seems like that's the issue for. Um, okay. So then beyond portal, I've been playing
733360	741840	um, unpleasant horse, which is awesome. Especially throwing little flying horses into a meat
741840	750280	grinders. Um, and then of course grand theft auto. That's it. Of course it just wouldn't
750280	753920	be a Loki week without grand theft auto. We always play grand theft auto. The only time
753920	757280	we're not going to play grand theft auto is when grand theft auto or another grand theft
757280	761720	auto comes out. Then it will just be new grand theft auto. Exactly. Uh, video games I've
761720	765440	been playing this week. Um, sadly nothing new. I mean, uh, there hasn't been a lot of
765440	769680	the download games lately that have been very appealing, uh, that I've wanted to grab and
769680	774280	nothing in retail is really jumping out at me right now. Uh, so, uh, just reiterating
774280	777960	the same stuff I'd be portal to, as I said, at the top of the show, that was a big accomplishment.
777960	781640	Still need to work on co-op. Mikkel, Tom, I know you're listening. You work on co-op,
781640	786120	uh, more. I'll join you if, uh, well, I've got my PS3 copy and they'll, I'll join you
786120	790480	once the network comes. Yeah, screw Mikkel top. We'll do it. All right. All right. Sounds
790480	795840	good. Anyhow. Uh, let's see what else, uh, I've been playing or can't you do split screen?
795840	801680	You can, but one of our controller PS3 controllers is still in a box. So there's only one controller.
801680	807720	Well, how can we get it out of this impenetrable cardboard box? No, I know if only there were
807720	813760	a way to break into the, the fortress that is the cardboard box. It's in a box. We don't
813760	817960	know which box it's in. It's, it's like playing a game show. Well, it's very easy. There's
817960	822240	a very simple solution to that. You rip open all the boxes, the PSN controller, the other
822240	827120	box has the lube. We don't know which box you rip open all the boxes, dump them on the
827120	833960	floor and then you'll find it. That's it. And then the cats have a new play space, which
833960	838720	by the way, do you know we portal cats just tangent here? Cause I need to say this. We
838720	842480	bought the cats a new bed, which I understand it takes cats time to get adjusted to a bed.
842480	846640	We bought the cats an awesome pink bed with leopard print. It's the tackiest fucking thing
846640	851160	you'll ever see. And I love it. And uh, yeah. Where did the cat decide to make its home?
851160	855680	In the pile of dirty laundry. Of course you buy them nice things and they don't appreciate
855680	861680	it. That's a cat earlier. I got Shermie this really nice series of cat beds that should
861680	866840	just ignore. And then I pick up this one for 13 bucks on sale and it's her favorite thing.
866840	871680	Just give it time because I know these things take like my cat. I got her a nice new bed
871680	877920	and she was scared of it because it looked like a cat. Do you like your bed? Yeah. Dan
877920	882760	says in the other room she slept on a box. She slept on a box. I had a cat that tried
882760	887120	that he was a little bit bigger than the shoe box, but he ever since he was a kitten would
887120	892560	sleep in the shoe box until he looked like a muffin loaf pouring over the edges of this
892560	897560	box, but he would still cram laundry though. Then they have to use the cat bed. No, no.
897560	901880	You know what they use when there's no dirty laundry? They use my chair. Oh, that's what
901880	904520	they do. Anyway, I don't want to talk about cats. I want to talk about games, but I also
904520	907720	want to talk about this comment. Mielethov just IME. He's like, well, just tell me when
907720	911440	you want to play portal two and I'll play. But he also said, apparently I missed the
911440	917560	remark about I'd go back for $5 to final fantasy 11 if you would to kind of like a suicide
917560	925880	pact. Oh, sad. I like that. Oh man. If I had the time, I know, right. I would just get
925880	932080	old times. Let's, let's just go not have a life again. And that's like, so I don't know.
932080	938320	Uh, nonconformist because you know, everybody's like MMO. Wow. You know, fuck that. We're
938320	945240	going to final fantasy 11. What? It's like, I don't know. Just, I missed grandma Tarou.
945240	948360	Okay. Look, other games I've played, speaking of Final Fantasy, I'm still playing Final
948360	951800	Fantasy four on the PSP. I play it for like 30 minutes before I go to bed every night.
951800	955600	It's a nice little way to kind of, you know, rest before bed. I, I, of course I love that
955600	959560	game on the super Nintendo. So of course I love the PSN port and I'm doing, I'm doing
959560	963240	kind of the Jamie thing where I have to play it chronologically. Like, you know, where
963240	967340	you guys are doing the final fantasy marathon. Well, I'm starting with four and then I'll
967340	971160	play the interlude and then I'll play after years finally, which I played like a little
971160	976680	bit of on the Wii, but I want to play it on the PSP cause I love the new graphics and
976680	980760	it really is just a great looking game and I hope people didn't overlook it because it
980760	984400	came out the same week as portal. Cause that would just be, I really want five and six
984400	992920	to come out the portal. Exactly. Shiny. Um, otherwise I can't play portal on a PSP. That's
992920	997240	most that's, yeah, that's true. He can't play portal in bed. Well actually you probably
997240	1003080	could play portal on a PSP if they hacked the, uh, you know, their streaming thing because
1003080	1006880	I think it has enough buttons to where you can do it and just wouldn't build a zoom who
1006880	1010160	needs zoom. Oh, and I also played a little bit of mortal combat, which would be very,
1010160	1014520	very important at the end of the show. So I remember that. And then, um, let's see what
1014520	1019600	else. Um, Oh, there was one other thing I wanted to mention. Oh, star craft too. Even
1019600	1023680	though I am terrible, I've said that's the, that's the one I need to encourage a league
1023680	1026760	for because I always talk to people about star craft too. And everybody I talk to is
1026760	1030960	like, yeah, I'm really bad too. And I'm like, and nobody wants to play online because everybody's
1030960	1036320	bad. So we need like a bad league. I have never played star craft too. It's it's the
1036320	1041400	last RTS I played was red alert. The first red alert. Did you ever play like the original
1041400	1046560	war craft or war craft too? I played war craft like once because I got a demo disc with PC
1046560	1052060	gamer. That's how long ago on the CD ROM. It's really not that different. I mean it
1052060	1056980	grant it's new graphics and all that stuff. I mean, but at its core, the old game or the,
1056980	1061720	the star craft series is really like the old war craft games. Just, you know, I'm sure
1061720	1065600	star craft fans get driven bonkers and I say that, but really at its core, it's kind of
1065600	1070600	what it is, you know, collection, build buildings, build units, attack, kill, destroy, and so
1070600	1075360	forth. So that was my gaming week. Join us in our chat room at chat dot orange launch
1075360	1079560	radio.com. If you want to chat with us with tonight's news, we'll be reading a random
1079560	1084960	comments in chat throughout the show. Um, silver Sonic in our chat room, for example,
1084960	1089280	says, didn't you mean on Twitter that you played Minecraft? Uh, I, I played that last
1089280	1093160	week. My review on Minecraft was last week and let me put it this way. I didn't play
1093160	1099700	it again this week. This is Rob's review. No, it wasn't that I was kind of like, I see,
1099700	1103320	you know what I think it is. I think Minecraft is a game for artists. I think Minecraft is
1103320	1107520	very much a game for artists because it's about like creating and you know, destroying
1107520	1111540	and chiseling. No, I have a question for me. I can't even draw a fucking, I have a question
1111540	1117120	for you though. If Minecraft weren't say little pixelated blocks and they were Legos, would
1117120	1122000	that make the game more? I love the little Lego builder. That's, I love that. You can
1122000	1125760	download this thing on the PC. I think I mentioned this last week. You can make your own little
1125760	1131260	Lego things and then actually have them ship to you instructions on how to build it because
1131260	1135120	the computer program remembers how you built it and like, I guess a logic and they will
1135120	1139200	send you all the appropriate bricks. So it's like this thing for people to do like eight
1139200	1144480	bit sprites in Legos. That sounds more interesting to me than it really. It's way more interesting
1144480	1149600	than Minecraft actually because I get something tangible out of it. You know, and not to knock
1149600	1155680	people that spend a lot of time making stuff in Minecraft, but, um, you know, be also in
1155680	1159880	Minecraft, you know, if you combine Minecraft, like the world and being able to build everything
1159880	1164000	like that with ZZT where you can actually make your own games. Fuck yes, I would be
1164000	1170200	all over that shit. Oh my God. Now we're talking like, I'm just shocked that there's like Minecraft
1170200	1175840	podcasts and all this stuff. Like I'm, I don't, you know, there's a lot of videos of people
1175840	1181280	like this is my basement and I want to support all indie podcasters. So look, I'm not knocking
1181280	1185920	it. Like if you're into that, that's awesome. It's just, I, I feel like I, I feel so not
1185920	1191240	cool for not understanding Minecraft. There's not, not even like that old crotchety man
1191240	1195360	sitting in the rocking chair going, these kids in their Minecraft, I don't understand.
1195360	1198480	We're not like knocking people saying, Oh, well you're wrong for liking Minecraft. It's
1198480	1204400	just, we don't, don't get it yet. I don't know. It, you know, it might be something.
1204400	1208040	The problem is I don't have enough free time to tinker with something like this when I
1208040	1213400	can be playing other things. And you know, if I ever came across, you know, an extra
1213400	1219840	12 hours in a day where I could just sit there and build in Minecraft, then yeah, that might
1219840	1226720	be a fun game for me, but I just don't have the time. Although if you want to like say
1226720	1230800	port that over Nintendo and put some Animal Crossing characters in that and sell it to
1230800	1234920	my wife, then I might get the play a little bit more. All right. Go into our chat room
1234920	1239040	at chat.orangelandtrader.com for some comments. Kaijuto in our chat room says, to understand
1239040	1243000	Minecraft, you have to get the pay version. It has a lot more. The free version is a joke,
1243000	1246740	but yeah, but if the free version isn't that great, then it doesn't really make me want
1246740	1252520	to get the pay version, but I get it. Let's see. I apologize if I mispronounced this,
1252520	1258600	but Entitelus, Entitelitus, Entitelitus says, what's the name of that 8-bit Zelda clone
1258600	1263840	on the PS3 that came out a while back? That was a 3d.heroes. Yeah, that game was cool.
1263840	1268920	I want another one of those. I'm surprised I never got sued. Uh, let's see. Black Wolf
1268920	1273840	in our chat room says, it's okay, Rob. I don't understand. Wow. Yet some people do wow podcasts
1273840	1277560	too. No, I'm with you Black Wolf. I don't understand wow either, but because you guys
1277560	1282880	just aren't cool. It's sorry to say it like, you know, I'm not, I still like you guys.
1282880	1287940	You're just not cool. I just, I never understood, you know, just from looking at the outside
1287940	1292120	in my, you know, five second opinion of wow, you know, I just don't get it. It doesn't,
1292120	1297720	I don't, it doesn't look appealing to me at all. Like I just Final Fantasy, it was a little
1297720	1301080	bit more appealing because I understand, you know, a little bit of the lore at least, and
1301080	1306320	I recognize the characters and that kind of thing. Wow. I never played enough, you know,
1306320	1311240	Warcraft to begin with. I don't care. Here's, here's the thing about wow. Like I'll just
1311240	1315260	like sum it up as fast as I can. It's really about the people that I play with that keep
1315260	1318880	me doing it because if the people weren't there that I was playing with, I would've
1318880	1322920	canceled my account a long time ago. I got really close this past week. Oh my God. I
1322920	1326440	got so frustrated at something in the game. I really wanted to cancel my account, but
1326440	1330760	I kind of have that podcast now and there's also the community of people I really like
1330760	1335400	that also play it. So, and that's probably why the Minecraft people do their thing cause
1335400	1339240	they've got a community too, but I'm just not able to be in that community because of
1339240	1344680	a terrible, terrible, terrible artist. That's what it is. Well, I'm just saying, you know,
1344680	1352320	the, uh, the best little tarot house in vanity is not that bad of a name either. All right,
1352320	1355880	let's uh, let's move on. We need to get to some gaming news quickly. Housekeeping, uh,
1355880	1360400	visit our website, orange on trader.com. Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange
1360400	1365320	lounge. And we're also on Twitter as O L R. It's like we have a different username everywhere.
1365320	1368840	Sorry about that, but it's kind of a long name. All right, let's get to some gaming
1368840	1374440	news once again. I think y'all know where we're going to go tonight right off the bat.
1374440	1381280	Let's talk about the Atari. No, um, fucking love Atari combat rocks. Yes. Uh, station.com
1381280	1389480	part of a Sony online. Apparently Sony online has gone down. Uh, they've dropped the, uh,
1389480	1395200	or they suspend their services after they discovered an issue. That issue being that
1395200	1403040	their, um, network was also infiltrated as part of that, uh, PlayStation network infiltration
1403040	1411320	from hackers. Uh, apparently also they lost, uh, 12,700 credit card account numbers and
1411320	1419360	24.6 million accounts were compromised. That sucks. And of course they're letting everybody
1419360	1425280	know, no, this wasn't a second attack. It was just part of the first attack. Yeah, that
1425280	1430320	makes it all better. You know that they got it one swoop instead of twice because twice
1430320	1441840	would just be ridiculous now, wouldn't it? Um, so yeah, uh, that does suck. And, um,
1441840	1447640	you know, they really haven't said what they're doing, at least on the Sony online, um, side.
1447640	1452120	I mean, I know there's a lot of stuff we'll be getting into about the PlayStation network,
1452120	1458920	but uh, that sucks. And of course, I think for like the people that are playing, um,
1458920	1462640	you know, the games on there, I think you're getting like a free month or something. So
1462640	1468760	not good. It's just kind of interesting that this all comes out the week that, oh yeah,
1468760	1472840	we're going to get the system back online. Oh shit, we got hacked more. But here's the
1472840	1482440	thing though. It was from an outdated database, they said from 2007 and it says of the, um,
1482440	1490920	12,700 total, 4,300, I guess, were from Japan. Um, and then I guess some more from other
1490920	1499240	European countries. They're saying though that, um, that the, uh, US credit and debit
1499240	1504840	card numbers and expiration dates, not the security codes were part of that database.
1504840	1509680	I actually have kind of a crazy question. Has anyone asked this question of Sony yet?
1509680	1514400	I'm not sure, but I've got to put it out there. Why the fuck did they have credit card information
1514400	1520000	from 2007? Why are they not required by law to purge that information? Why do they need
1520000	1525920	it? You don't need credit card information from 2007, do you? I mean, maybe they need
1525920	1532040	it for tax. It might be a service server backup or something like that. I don't know. Well,
1532040	1538440	I don't care. You should have to purge that by law. I understand the only benefit of keeping
1538440	1543160	information that only this just comes from working with loans is that you can go back
1543160	1549400	and find issues where people have done fraud and you have to track back data that far.
1549400	1554440	But at the same time though, like a lot of places will have server warehouses or backups
1554440	1559840	or whatever. They'll pay a third party company to back up everything in like another, another
1559840	1565280	branch somewhere. Like I know our company, we, uh, they have, I roll my eyes every time
1565280	1573080	they mentioned something like this. They have a place in Arizona that's like a place that
1573080	1578600	other companies send their data. It's like a, in case, you know, something catastrophic
1578600	1584760	happens and the company is like incinerated, at least all this data is backed up in Arizona
1584760	1590560	in like a mountains or something like that. A little crazy, but hey, you know what? If
1590560	1595680	a company as small as ours is doing something like that, Sony should be storing it in like
1595680	1601380	the bottom of a volcano and like the middle of like some sort of evil lair in the ocean
1601380	1605520	or something or in the bottom of, you know, an iceberg in Antarctica or something. I don't
1605520	1609760	know. Also, dark soccer, you worked for a bank, right? So for mortgage company owned
1609760	1614960	by a bank, a financial institution needing that information for that long. I get that
1614960	1620080	a way more than I do Sony needing that information. Sony is not a financial institution. I think
1620080	1625520	having the information backed up on a separate server is one thing. Having it is still an
1625520	1633240	active memory for lack of a better description. That's kind of dumb. I can see holding onto
1633240	1639600	the information, especially for purposes of bookkeeping, accounting, you know, but it
1639600	1645920	was how long, how old? Well, here's the thing they were saying. Seven is kinda, here's the
1645920	1653640	thing they were saying though. Of the 12,700 cards stolen, 900 were still active. Oh, well,
1653640	1658840	it's just 900 then. Well, that's why are we even making this an issue? Those 900 people
1658840	1665800	can suck it. Wow. All right. So let's just pop in our chat room, but I give it a spread.
1665800	1669780	This shines a little light on this saying, uh, I'm pretty sure they are going back two
1669780	1673840	years or more at the porn place. We were only allowed to archive the last four digits and
1673840	1677640	expiration date and dark soccer was right. It was in case we were ever subpoenaed or
1677640	1682440	anything and had to look up legacy order history re sketchy use of a card. Like if it wasn't
1682440	1686680	stolen and a relative was using it, but the whole card number was purged after a year,
1686680	1692880	I think. Yeah, that's kind of the transaction history. I get that, but the card number and
1692880	1699480	data itself, that is very weird. Tax audits was the only thing I can think of. Um, even
1699480	1704680	then, doesn't your bank take, why did Sony need that? So bank having that, I get it.
1704680	1710840	Sony having it, I don't. Yeah, I don't. There's a huge problem I have with that. Hence why
1710840	1715080	we turn to Congress and what, why Congress is getting involved with all of this right
1715080	1719020	now. And Sony actually responded to Congress this week. You might remember last week we
1719020	1723160	talked to Congress was getting involved, writing a nice little letter to Sony going, uh, what
1723160	1726380	the fuck is going on? Are you, did you put all these Americans informations at risk?
1726380	1731300	You know, just basically in a nutshell there, um, cause her eyes and an open letter back
1731300	1735520	to Congress detailing Sony's various principles and how they've been dealing with the PlayStation
1735520	1741000	network outage and all the various leaks. Uh, it is on various blogs all over the place
1741000	1747740	for you to take a look at. Uh, they also summarized it on the PlayStation blog. Uh, they had various
1747740	1752960	principles that they worked with during this whole issue. Act with care and caution, provide
1752960	1757200	relevant information to the public when it has been verified. Take responsibility for
1757200	1763200	our obligations to our customers. Work with law enforcement authorities. Uh, also they've
1763200	1767920	talked about the timeline for the attack. Uh, they said, quote, we discovered that the
1767920	1773200	intruders had placed a file on one of our Sony online entertainment servers named anonymous
1773200	1778880	with the words, we are, hold on. They hacked my computer too. Look, there is a text file
1778880	1783440	right here. It says we are Legion. That's impossible. Only they could have done that.
1783440	1787560	It's impossible that anybody else could create a text file that says we are Legion and they're
1787560	1792520	named anonymous. How is this possible? How did they do this? I thought my network was
1792520	1801360	secure. There was also a text. There's also a text file named Crayola in the system. Apparently
1801360	1806520	with the names of 256 flavors of crayons. I don't know why they had that, but it was
1806520	1811120	in the system. I have a comment on this. Yes, Dan, how are you Dan? Does anybody else find
1811120	1819640	it ironic that our government is mad at Sony because when Sony overreacted to somebody
1819640	1825320	hacking their system, the hackers came back to get them and it backfired on them, right?
1825320	1830580	And we, we do that all the time. That's what we do. We're Americans. We're like that country
1830580	1837440	stumbled their nose at us. Let's go get them. Five years later. Fuck. What were we thinking?
1837440	1842680	Come on guys. Give Sony a break. They're dealing. But at the same time, you know, that's what
1842680	1852720	they get. Fuckers. Well, it's just like, well, you know, I, I have blamed on this show an
1852720	1859000	awful lot. The problem is Sony lies with the way they're being managed. They are a horribly
1859000	1866160	managed company right now. Horribly managed company. And the only thing that is more horribly
1866160	1871920	managed than Sony is the government. So this whole exchange really, like when I read about
1871920	1886500	it, this is what I hear in my head. And it's, it's great cause they're like, Oh, we think
1886500	1891000	anonymous did it because there was this text file. Yeah. Wow. That, that, well, that's,
1891000	1895640	that's proof right there that somebody, you know, it couldn't have been any other hacker
1895640	1900840	whatsoever that, you know, put that text file in there to, you know, maybe divert attention
1900840	1910360	away from them and to anonymous. Or it could have been, you know, keep in mind you've got
1910360	1916840	a group that's decentralized and leaderless pretty much. So you can't control it. Everybody
1916840	1920360	who might be associated with it does. I've got more on that in just a moment. Let me,
1920360	1924600	uh, let me get that here. By the way, Sony says they still have yet to identify the individual
1924600	1928760	or individuals that are responsible for the breach. Of course not because, Oh my God,
1928760	1934100	it would be the minute it is identified who did this. And if Sony in any way possible
1934100	1939280	can tie it to anonymous, it's going to be like the headline on every fucking website
1939280	1945480	out there. Like anonymous, not so anonymous anymore. Meet the face of anonymous. You know,
1945480	1950160	it's whoever gets caught with this is going to get drugged through the proverbial street.
1950160	1954520	It is retarded. I mean, cause once again, you're saying that this is a group with no
1954520	1959560	real leadership. Okay. There are people that are leaders or whatever and you know, there
1959560	1963360	are people that are acting on their own on this website or whatever. Well basically it's
1963360	1968660	4chan. Okay. So let's just not even call it anonymous anymore. It's 4chan. Okay. And then
1968660	1974680	on top of that, if, if you don't have a, if it's not really a group that has any sort
1974680	1979580	of, you know, structure to their membership or anything that anybody can claim membership
1979580	1983880	to it, then you can't even really go after the group. You have to say it's this person
1983880	1989300	that did it because it's not anonymous because not all of them participated in it. It's this
1989300	1994160	one dude that says he's an anonymous. Like if I said I'm in anonymous right now and I
1994160	2000520	kicked Jamie or is she going to go sue anonymous because you know, no, I wouldn't bother suing
2000520	2005840	you. I just punch you in the face. Dude, dark soccer is going to punch anonymous in the
2005840	2014840	face. You know, make sure we poop in your soda or something. It's just, it's, it's dumb
2014840	2020720	is what it is. All right. I need to get some more. Speaking of anonymous, uh, they of course
2020720	2027780	have denied responsibility for this. Yes. Sorry. And I hate bringing up these guys,
2027780	2035580	but um, you may remember back with certain people griefing said podcasts that were part
2035580	2044280	of a certain forum. Yeah. So anonymous was griefing this podcast. That's how retarded
2044280	2052320	Jamie go punch them in the face. So anyways, it's, it's just, all right, look, you can't
2052320	2056800	claim that the group is behind it because there is no group. It's just people that say
2056800	2062160	that they're part of this group. So you'll just find who's behind it. It's people, not
2062160	2066680	a group. All right, look, speaking of anonymous, uh, they did send a statement to the guardian.
2066680	2070540	I'm not, I don't, I mean, I just don't understand how it works. Who sent the statement to the
2070540	2074400	guardian because I didn't think anyone was supposedly in charge, but I guess really there
2074400	2080220	is like a council or something. So there's like, so there's gotta be some type of hierarchy
2080220	2084680	and anonymous because who's sending the letter because otherwise Loki could just send a letter
2084680	2091200	to the guardian thing. Anonymous is official statement is poop, poop, fart, fart, but who's
2091200	2100360	to say that's not the official statement. Evil council, evil council.
2100360	2105920	That's a power reference. Anyway, the statement said public support is not gained by stealing
2105920	2109400	credit card info and personal identities. We are trying to fight criminal activities
2109400	2114440	by corporations and governments, not steal credit cards. If a legitimate and honest investigation
2114440	2118520	into the credit card is conducted, anonymous will not be found liable while we are in a
2118520	2124760	distributed and decentralized group. Our leadership does not condone credit card theft. Poop,
2124760	2133200	poop, fart. I mean, seriously, who's to say that, you know, since it's, but then apparently
2133200	2138160	according to a different report in the financial times, two veteran members of anonymous that
2138160	2142540	I guess the financial times knew, I guess they weren't that anonymous, but somehow they
2142540	2149720	got in touch there saying that some element of that original attack was probably the likely
2149720	2155960	reason. The word likely was involved. And then, uh, according to these veteran members
2155960	2159960	quote, if you say you are anonymous and do something as anonymous, then anonymous did
2159960	2170640	it. Well, regardless, whoever did this, I mean, whoever did this is going to be in a
2170640	2175000	whole lot of trouble if they ever get found out. It's going to be public embarrassment.
2175000	2180560	I mean, at this point, but yeah, if they do, I mean, you know, it's already pretty Sony
2180560	2187040	systems are unhackable. You can't dare dare on their day of, they're prevented against
2187040	2194600	all types of intrusions, right? You know why they can't find any way to hack the systems?
2194600	2201200	Cause they did it with my mind. All this credit cards gone. All right, dark soccer. What do
2201200	2206760	you know? And then I put that text file there so we'll never know it's me. Well, Sony has
2206760	2213120	basically, um, because there's still a wallowing in their own poop like a retarded monkeys,
2213120	2218440	they have decided that, oh, we could do something to help these people maybe. So they are partnering
2218440	2225480	with Debics, D E B I X to give 12 months of identity theft protection for free. Um, also
2225480	2231800	not just a 12 months, but also adding the time that the service was out to. Um, so there
2231800	2235640	should be offers coming out over the next few days with a promotional code for the service
2235640	2242800	and people will have until June 18th to register for it. Um, I'm wondering though, this is
2242800	2247920	going to be some sort of, ooh, do we have to pay for a longer term if we get this as
2247920	2254480	like a free, you know, it better be completely free, no strings attached. That's my thing.
2254480	2258920	That basically is saying that what the all clear ID service is going to have a cyber
2258920	2263440	monitoring and surveillance of the Internet to detect exposure of all clear ID plus customers
2263440	2270320	personal information. Um, a million dollar, um, identity theft insurance policy per user
2270320	2274160	to provide additional protection. In case of all clear, blah, blah, blah, becomes a
2274160	2279520	victim of identity theft. So remember, hackers, you need to wait until till they sign up for
2279520	2285960	it till June 18th, 2012 to do all the stealing of identities. So those bastards aren't covered
2285960	2290440	at all. That'll suck it to him. What you do is you make, okay, hacker people make friends
2290440	2298360	with your victim and then say, okay, I'll hack you and we'll split the money. Yeah,
2298360	2305560	Jamie shame on you. It's just too little too late. Um, and on top of that, you know, identity
2305560	2310200	protection services are really such, I mean this one says, Oh, we'll cover your legal
2310200	2314080	costs and blah, blah, blah. But really all you have to do is go to your bank and your
2314080	2319160	bank covers this shit. You cancel your cards, you know, unless somebody has gone out and
2319160	2326480	done something wholly illegal, like shoot somebody in the face and then leaves your
2326480	2333200	driver's license on them. You know, which I don't see anybody about to go do. Then that's,
2333200	2338040	that's different. And no, don't use that as an idea. I'll leave a card that says anonymous
2338040	2341720	on it when they shoot them in the face and then they'll think that they just right out.
2341720	2345020	We are Legion in their blood. You spell it out with their intros. I think the intestines
2345020	2355840	long enough for that girl. So, uh, you got problems. I do not have problems. I have solutions
2355840	2359400	and I want to know what this is that you linked me. That's supposed to do with Europe. That
2359400	2363400	isn't anything about Europe. Somebody made a mistake in our little show, roll thread
2363400	2368000	and you got the, uh, wrong. Well, apparently they're trying to do the same thing for Europe.
2368000	2378080	The end. And there you go. So can I read this comment from a chair real quick? Amiga seven
2378080	2383840	seven seven in our chat room says like some people on the net say gaming needs a WikiLeaks.
2383840	2387320	I don't know. In theory, that's kind of a neat idea, but I don't know if gaming could
2387320	2392120	the gaming community could handle something as serious as WikiLeaks. Like gaming needs
2392120	2396600	a Perez Hilton. That's what, that's what gaming needs. Something a little more. That's what
2396600	2403840	the, um, our website should do. Draw cocks on people's faces. That would be great. Coconoses
2403840	2411680	on Marcus Phoenix. Let's do it. Loki. Um, yeah, I'm not about to go draw cocks on people's
2411680	2417280	faces unless I put anonymous below it and then you know, they'll think that they drew
2417280	2423120	cocks on people's faces. Ah, yeah. Anyways. Uh, so the PlayStation network supposed to
2423120	2429680	come up this week, but as you know, it's not up this week. What the hell? It's, uh, been
2429680	2434760	delayed because apparently they need further testing. Uh, and says, obviously not coming
2434760	2443400	back this week. And, uh, it says that, you know, uh, based on, you know, this is when
2443400	2448160	we held the press conference in Japan last week, uh, based on what we knew, we expected
2448160	2452520	to have services online within a week. We were unaware of the extent of the attack on
2452520	2458200	Sony online, um, servers and we're taking this opportunity to conduct further testing
2458200	2464880	of the incredibly complex system. I might add the incredibly complex and poorly guarded
2464880	2475560	system. Um, yeah, so it's not coming back this week. Surprise, surprise. And, um, apparently
2475560	2480920	there is some stuff that came out from, to be fair, Loki, I mean, if I'm understanding
2480920	2486880	correctly what exactly Sony is having to do right now, they are basically having to rewrite
2486880	2493160	the entire fucking PlayStation network in two weeks. A process that took months to begin
2493160	2497080	with, right? Am I right? That's kind of what they're doing. They're talking about reconstructing
2497080	2502400	the whole fucking thing from the ground up. See this? It's the tiniest violin playing
2502400	2508960	it for them. I feel so bad for them that they had to create an entirely new database. If
2508960	2515280	only they had known that their database were, um, you know, poorly updated and, uh, just
2515280	2522000	not ready for any sort of hacker attack. Oh, but they did because I legitimately do feel
2522000	2527400	sorry for everybody that's having to work plenty of overtime right now. Probably mandatory
2527400	2531640	overtime trying to fix this situation when it's really not their fault. Well, it's somebody's
2531640	2534840	fault. They made decisions and unfortunately that's the way it works. Yeah, but it's like
2534840	2538880	the grunts are having to pay for the queen bees decision and that's very unfortunate.
2538880	2545320	So I really like this situation will never get better and tell Howard Stringer comes
2545320	2552240	down. You don't like it. You don't work there. That seems pretty simple to me. Anyways, so
2552240	2558160	some information coming out of the house of representatives, energy and commerce subcommittee
2558160	2564000	on the commerce, manufacturing and trade. Wow. That's a long title. Um, according to
2564000	2568800	the breach and this is, I had to laugh at a little bit too because I think from what
2568800	2574000	I heard that it's some guy saying that he read somewhere on a forum, this information,
2574000	2579600	I hope that's not the case, but, uh, apparently they're seeing that Sony had learned several
2579600	2587120	months ago that, um, apparently the PlayStation network was hosted on servers running very
2587120	2593600	old versions of Apache software that were unpatched and had no firewall installed. No
2593600	2600880	firewall. That's awesome. I think that was debunked. I think, uh, uh, some other internet
2600880	2606000	thing looked into it and found that no, there's caches out there that prove that that isn't
2606000	2611240	the case. Okay. So this is just a case of Congress kind of understanding something and
2611240	2619160	further complicating the situation. Exactly. Well, like I even remember reading this and
2619160	2624400	I had to, I had to find it cause I actually read part of maybe the transcript or something
2624400	2630080	like that. They were, they were quoted. Yeah. I had read on a, on a Sony or read on a forum
2630080	2634640	that this was, they literally said, I read this on a forum. You're taking a forum as
2634640	2643240	fact. Awesome. Nothing wrong with that at all. Now, Sony, I read this on a forum and
2643240	2649360	I understand you like mudkips. Can you explain to me, Sony, what is a mudkip? Hey, I read
2649360	2655520	here on another forum fucking Nintendo. It totally told me where the WMDs were in Iraq.
2655520	2662440	Where's WMDs there. This forum said so we need to go right now. Um, they would never
2662440	2668320	be wrong. And then this is great. Apparently there is a rumored third attack planned for
2668320	2678960	Sony. Um, so it says, and this is great. Let's, let's just read through this and laugh at
2678960	2683920	the source. Okay. A group of hackers says that they're playing another wave of cyber
2683920	2692160	attacks against Sony retaliation for its handling of the PlayStation network breach. Because
2692160	2699240	you're mad about the way they're handling this situation. Your plan is to hack them
2699240	2706600	again. Hey, listen, we're going to, we're going to hack you again. So we're in an observer.
2706600	2712040	Wait, wait, hold on. This is great. This is where this is coming from. An observer of
2712040	2720480	an internet relay chat channel used by hackers told Cena. So it's a guy in a chat room that
2720480	2738880	witnessed random people talking. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm holding, I'm waiting.
2738880	2747320	He doesn't yet. Loki. Oh my God. Oh my God. Report the news. Apparently I just hacked
2747320	2759360	Sony. It said so in this internet relay channel. So, um, yes, that, that, that's really credible.
2759360	2766080	That's about one step below forum posts. But, um, Hey, you know, I guess that that's, uh,
2766080	2773000	that's fact. So, um, yeah. Should the plant attack and the tax succeed, it would be the
2773000	2777280	latest blow in the series of devastating tech. That's right. Should this attack a seed? It
2777280	2786360	would be another attack against Sony. Wow. That's great reporting. Uh, in our chat says
2786360	2794840	I have a hankering to watch hackers now. Crash override. Zero. Cool. Angelina Jolie. That's
2794840	2800320	what they should have put in there. They should have put all that stuff like hack the planet
2800320	2812240	and all this crap from the hackers movie. That would have been hilarious. Ah, I can't.
2812240	2819080	All right. All right. Yeah, that's it. We're, we're not going to, I don't. So what now?
2819080	2824120	I mean, that was an exclusive article though. Can I say this though? Cause I read this on
2824120	2829640	Facebook, so I know it's true. And, and you know, you commented on one of Salacious Pop's
2829640	2833800	posts and you said, ah, gamers will forget this in a year. Will they really? I mean,
2833800	2837040	now it's, I realize I say, I've said that on the show before and it's, it's usually
2837040	2840880	pretty true. Like, you know, most people have pretty much forgiven Microsoft for the whole
2840880	2845040	red ring of death thing at this point, you know, and a lot of folks have forgiven other
2845040	2849240	gaming companies for their massive fuckups, but I mean, we're going on date 18 and this
2849240	2855280	could be like literally a month before this is fixed. I mean, we might forget what happened,
2855280	2859760	but will the developers who've now lost a month of sales forget what's happened? And
2859760	2866360	we are getting dangerously close to E3 for Sony. I mean, E3 is less than awesome. Now
2866360	2871880	imagine if PlayStation network is not up by the time that they all, that is awesome. That
2871880	2876400	would be awesome. Granted, the system will probably not awesome for PlayStation or people,
2876400	2880000	but awesome for the press conference. You've seen that GIF on the internet of Michael Jackson
2880000	2883280	eating the popcorn from the thriller video. That's like all of us right now at the, at
2883280	2888640	the press conference for Sony. If, if PlayStation network is not a hundred percent working now,
2888640	2892000	I'm sure at least the multiplayer gaming and all that crap will be back and home will be
2892000	2896040	up and all that. But if the store's not up, I'm saying, which is the hardest part, I think
2896040	2900200	for them to fix, it's going to be interesting. Like the keynote is going to be really weird
2900200	2905280	this year. It's going to be so weird. Like it's just going to be a train wreck, I think.
2905280	2908880	Well, especially if they're going to be talking about like, you know, it's going to be, it's
2908880	2912680	going to overshadow whatever they're showing. And there's some awesome, like the last guardian
2912680	2915880	and shit. Like I want to know more about that. And there's some pretty exciting shit that's
2915880	2919480	supposed to be coming out for PlayStation, especially when they're talking about like,
2919480	2924960	you know, the, in the next PlayStation portable system or whatever, that's going to have like
2924960	2929200	a lot of this, you know, storefront stuff built into it. We'd love to show you it, but
2929200	2942080	uh, you know, hackers and it's down. Yeah, um, I, I, uh, I'm, I'm curious to see how
2942080	2945620	many times and we should have a betting pool on this. Actually, you know what? I have the
2945620	2949440	week off of work. What I would love to do is, yeah, I do. So what we need to do, we
2949440	2954580	need to have a Sony press conference drinking game and we each need to pick a word. And
2954580	2957440	every time we hear that word, we're going to take a shot and my word is going to be
2957440	2964440	secure. So every time we hear the word secure at the PlayStation, E3 press conference, I'm
2964440	2969360	going to take a shot and I'm going to be hacker. I'm going to put like, you know, even odds
2969360	2976800	that I will end up in the hospital at the end of the PlayStation press conference.
2976800	2982720	I pick hacker. Am I trying to kill myself in this or not? I mean, what's, what's what
2982720	2986420	type of, you're trying to kill yourself, trying to kill myself. So what word would you pick
2986420	2997720	to make yourself end up in the hospital? PlayStation. No, you can't pick that dummy. You never said
2997720	3007280	I couldn't find Sony either. And you can't pick NGP or whatever. You're no fun. Oh God,
3007280	3015000	I hate you. All right. Oh, and then of course, finally, uh, Sony there, this is great. There
3015000	3023680	apparently, now I don't know if I should really trust this since it's also from CNET the website
3023680	3029040	that gets their information from people that saw internet relay chats. Um, but apparently
3029040	3033400	they're saying that Sony is waiting in weather to offer a reward for the information on the
3033400	3038600	hackers behind the massive network outage. Um, so they're looking, they're going to put
3038600	3043760	out a reward. It's going to be all Milt Gibson, you know, here's a million dollars. Find them.
3043760	3056960	Give me back my son. Yes, that's exactly what's going to happen. I need you to find these
3056960	3069280	and give me back my son. Uh, also I guess, uh, Sony's denied allegations made in the
3069280	3074460	congressional testimony on Thursday that the servers were not running under the most current
3074460	3079600	security update. Of course, this is the previous network for Sony network entertainment, international
3079600	3083680	and Sony online entertainment use servers that were patched and updated recently and
3083680	3090320	had multiple security measures in place, including firewalls, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3090320	3097720	Um, well, you know what, here's what I have to say about that. It didn't do damn good.
3097720	3103360	It did it. You know, whether you had firewalls up or no firewalls, they still got in. So
3103360	3109720	I don't know, is that even more pathetic that they were updated and ready to go? I mean,
3109720	3114720	at least if they weren't updated, you know, I might say, okay, that's how they got in.
3114720	3119060	But since they were, then how am I going to trust that your brand new network or whatever
3119060	3122360	that you're rebuilding from the ground up is going to be any different than this one
3122360	3127760	since you're, you know, superb security was no match for the hackers.
3127760	3131960	Give me back my son!
3131960	3132960	Ah, yes.
3132960	3143400	Um, actually, I think the reward's a pretty good idea. I think, um, I think the reward,
3143400	3147960	you know, what better way to get all these guys to turn on each other than put a million
3147960	3152560	dollars on the line, right? It's actually a pretty smart move on Sony's part if they
3152560	3159760	do it, if they do it, but we'll see. Uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm so looking forward to the E3
3159760	3162520	press conference, but anyway, I don't know what else to say about the situation at this
3162520	3167040	point. I feel like there's just, you just like, do you remember the Ricky Lake talk
3167040	3171960	show in the 1990s? Do you remember Ricky Lake? Go Ricky. Do you remember Ricky Lake? Do you
3171960	3175240	remember how like whenever her guests would just get like totally out of control on the
3175240	3178520	stage, she'd just kind of be standing there with a microphone or jaws just all drop. Like
3178520	3183580	I, like that's me right now. I'm out of my element. Exactly. Like I'm just kind of looking
3183580	3188720	at the stage at all these people fighting and Sony and anonymous and the Congress and
3188720	3193640	I'm just looking and I'm just, my mouth just dropped and I'm shaking my head. That's all
3193640	3199560	I've got left to say on the situation.
3199560	3203680	So let's talk about something else. Dark Sakura. Yes. Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. I have one of
3203680	3207960	the things. Sorry. My bad. Whatever it is. It's PlayStation related, but it's not about
3207960	3213640	the hack. Uh, it has to do with PlayStation rewards. Remember this? Well, you may not
3213640	3219600	because it never really happened, but there was a beta program that ended on March 31st
3219600	3227000	and an exclusive t-shirt was sent to the beta testers who got to one of the tiers in this
3227000	3232600	PlayStation rewards loyalty program. And they were sent a thank you card saying, wear it
3232600	3239620	proud. And they, yes, they got a t-shirt from this. Sony literally sent these people a t-shirt
3239620	3245120	that pretty much says I participated in a PlayStation beta and all I got was this lousy
3245120	3246120	t-shirt.
3246120	3247120	That's awesome.
3247120	3255200	Okay. Now Dark Sakura, sorry.
3255200	3261960	Sony you suck. How about something free? Something happy and free and not at all related to Sony.
3261960	3269560	There is a Thor game. It's a 16 bit browser based platformer and it is called, uh, Thor
3269560	3276040	bring the thunder. And, uh, it's basically like Thor, but done Mega Man style. So it
3276040	3287160	looks pretty neat. I think I would want that. And, uh, there actually is a, uh, DS version
3287160	3290680	either out or to be out. This is, yeah, I said May 3rd.
3290680	3295280	I was going to cue my wine. If this is just a 16 bit game, why couldn't like virtual console
3295280	3299680	be used for something like this? But no, that's too, that's too smart. That's that's that
3299680	3303680	would be something new and innovative. I'm sorry. But yeah, I like the idea of at least
3303680	3310680	a free game able to play online that has the rainbow road. I haven't seen the new movie
3310680	3319560	yet. Okay. I hear it's not bad in the comics. Well, I'll go ahead and I'll use ultimate.
3319560	3325400	He summons a freaking rainbow that brings us guardian heroes to earth. He brings the
3325400	3333900	mightiest warriors in the, in all of reality on the rainbow road to kick ass for Norse
3333900	3341960	justice. And I always like, that's very Norse and his level in, um, Marvel versus Capcom
3341960	3346520	three has rainbow road in the background. You know, I think he's really Mario. You know
3346520	3352280	what my favorite part of the Thor movie is though? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That wasn't
3352280	3355520	Thor at all. Actually. I've actually seen part of it, but just for a cameo that makes
3355520	3360240	me super excited. Oh, the whole Avengers tie in thing or something else. But one of my
3360240	3367120	favorite Avengers characters popped up. Okay. Makes me super happy. There you go. All right,
3367120	3373440	moving on. Let's try to give you a clue. It's it's Mel Gibson. All right, let's travel the
3373440	3377320	world and see what games are coming out soon in a gaming store near you and what games
3377320	3383520	you can play to help take your mind off of the, uh, Benny Hill theme song. Uh, this week
3383520	3389760	we've got some, uh, actually a pretty decent selection of titles Lego Pirates of the Caribbean
3389760	3393800	because you know, there's a new Pirates movie and there are Lego Pirates of the Caribbean
3393800	3398560	toys. So it only makes sense that there's Lego Pirates of the Caribbean game. And that's
3398560	3404720	out on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60. We and a DS. There is some online co-op play
3404720	3407620	except if you're on the PlayStation or cause you can't play on the PlayStation network
3407620	3415580	right now. A break coming out on a PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 and a PC this week. Also
3415580	3419560	with online co-op and multiplayer except on the PlayStation three because the PlayStation
3419560	3426720	network is down now. All right, I'll stop. Um, Yu-Gi-Oh fifties world championship 2011
3426720	3436920	from Konami on Nintendo DS. Um, the first Templar from Calypso on Xbox three 60 and
3436920	3442760	uh, Oh, I guess Lego Pirates was on PSP. How did I forget that? Virtua tennis four on a
3442760	3453240	PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 and the Wii and a dream trigger finally coming out on
3453240	3457520	the three DS. Actually though, now that I've seen gameplay of it, I am not picking that
3457520	3462840	game up. What's dream trigger all about? It was a music, um, kind of shoot him up game.
3462840	3467560	Um, but it was really weird looking. It's, I thought it was going to be kinda like rez,
3467560	3473020	but it's not. It's like, um, you have to tap the screen on the bottom and it creates like
3473020	3477800	a little radar thing and you see enemies. You have to go, Hey, not my thing. Um, if
3477800	3481780	it was like rez. Well, I'm taking a peek at a little, uh, pretty bad ass trailer here
3481780	3487080	that's on the YouTube. As you can see here, there are some shut up. I don't want to hear
3487080	3492800	this guy. Last but not least, MX versus ATV alive coming out, um, from THQ on PlayStation
3492800	3497400	three and Xbox three 60. And of course this is one of the first games that THQ is experimenting
3497400	3502120	with their lower price games. So it's only $40 retail and they're going to have a download
3502120	3505940	content every two weeks. So you know, Hey, if you want to kind of support that type of
3505940	3511800	thing and try to maybe get the prices of games down, then that'd be the way to go. So, um,
3511800	3515800	and I hear it's supposed to be pretty good and that's it for this week. See, I'm looking
3515800	3520640	at, I found a working where some dude isn't talking over it. Hold on. I really hate sometimes
3520640	3524440	that literally anyone can upload things to YouTube because I hate the people that just
3524440	3527560	take like someone else's YouTube and then do their own thing over it. Like, Oh, you
3527560	3536280	heard taste me. Hold on. Okay. So, uh, dream trigger. The next generation of handheld shooters
3536280	3546520	is here. Mind warping 3D. Over 50 levels. Collectible trophies in multiplayer. Wait,
3546520	3553720	trophies on a 3DS game. Hold on. It seems like on the bottom screen, you have to tap
3553720	3559080	it and you see where the enemies are on the top screen and then you have to shoot them.
3559080	3565920	Weird. I mean, it might be cool, but it's just, you know, I've already gotten three
3565920	3570960	3DS games that I don't play and so I don't really need to add a fourth to it. So, you
3570960	3577120	know, I'll just, I'll wait until, you know, I'll tell you what D3, you know, cause they're
3577120	3580720	the publisher of that game. You really want me to get the, you know, play a game on the
3580720	3587680	3DS. You'll portal over earth defense for us cause that would be awesome. At least bring
3587680	3593760	the PSP version of her. You know what? I'll get my PSP working again for that. All right,
3593760	3597720	let's travel to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates. This week on the Xbox 360 major
3597720	3603520	league baseball 2K11 comes out on May 12th. I should point this out. Portal two is out
3603520	3608640	next week and I wonder if that's a localization of the game. Like if they've actually redone
3608640	3613560	the voice acting and so forth. I don't know. It's in a lot of languages. Let me put it
3613560	3617520	that way. Okay, well maybe, maybe it's just the same version we have here. It's just finally
3617520	3621320	getting its Japanese release. I don't know, but I just, I wonder what GLaDOS sounds like
3621320	3625560	in Japanese. That's all. That's all I want to know, but that's next week. To give her
3625560	3633720	like an old, you know, Japanese man voice or whatever. On the PlayStation 3 major league
3633720	3641800	baseball 2K11 is out there as well as Suzumiya Harui no Suyasu comes out this week. It's
3641800	3648040	Haruhi. It's the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oh yeah, this is the same anime manga universe.
3648040	3654880	So this is a game coming out on PS3 this week. A whole game about that series. There's also
3654880	3658760	a box edition, a special box edition on that if you want to get that if you're a big fan
3658760	3664760	of the anime. On the Nintendo Wii, nothing. On the 3DS, Steel Diver is out this week in
3664760	3668520	Japan. Of course that was a launch game for us here, but they're just now getting that
3668520	3679840	in Japan. And lastly on the PSP, Planetarian Shisana Hoshi no Yume. That's a charity edition.
3679840	3683560	I'm not sure what that means. If that's a price reduction or something where the money
3683560	3689520	goes to charity. I don't have any translation on this, but it does look like the game is
3689520	3698640	kind of one of those like cyber anime space robot things. And also another version of
3698640	3705000	Suzumiya Harui is coming out there on the PSP as well. And lastly, Makai Senki Disgaea
3705000	3709920	2 Portable, of course Disgaea 2. Getting a price reduction this week on the PSP in Japan
3709920	3713800	and moves into the best series. There you go. There's your Japanese releases. How about
3713800	3720060	the UK? We do have a few things for the UK. Let me look at my calendar because it's going
3720060	3726240	to be another week. Oh finals week. Shoot me. Okay. We have on the ninth, Hydrophobia
3726240	3736080	Prophecy and on the 11th, Alads Online. And then on the 13th, we've got a few things.
3736080	3743320	We have Brink, Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, and that's it. Alright. Just a few more stories
3743320	3750280	for you guys. Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week. But first. Yes.
3750280	3758440	So apparently though, I kind of think I know what this is. Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver
3758440	3766720	is working on a core Kinect shooter game. And you know, there's been rumors for a while
3766720	3772320	now that they're going to be doing a Kinect Halo game. That's probably this. They're saying
3772320	3777080	that the studio's mission is to push the limits of the proven and unexplored game development
3777080	3783400	and show the world what's possible with Microsoft game consoles. That's pretty generic sounding.
3783400	3790120	But if I were to bet money, I would say it's probably going to be a Kinect Halo game. You
3790120	3794880	think? Yeah. Although. There were the rumors before about that anyway, so. It would be
3794880	3802760	cool if it was something original. Or you know, they want to be really cool. Not necessarily
3802760	3809280	I'd want a Kinect version of this, but Timesplitters isn't getting a lot of love lately. I really
3809280	3817800	love a new Timesplitters game. Just saying. Alright. One other story for you guys. This
3817800	3821040	is another big rumor that's popped up this week, and a lot of people kind of ignored
3821040	3824640	it because of everything that's going on with the Playstation. And honestly, this is probably
3824640	3829880	something that deserved to be ignored. But apparently, development kits for a brand new
3829880	3834920	Microsoft consoles were in the offices of one of EA Studios. This is according to a
3834920	3840480	source. They don't work for EA or Microsoft, but they did say that it came in a PC shell
3840480	3846640	and it was shipped to EA last month. I guess there's been rumors already about Xbox 360
3846640	3852800	dev kits, and this was set to sort of dispel that rumor or what have you. I don't know.
3852800	3856320	So of course, people are now speculating, is Microsoft set to reveal a new console at
3856320	3861720	E3? Well, EA's director of corporate communications came out and said in a statement to IGN that
3861720	3871880	that story was, quote, a total fabrication. It is 100% not true. And, you know, I absolutely
3871880	3875840	no way is there a Microsoft console being shown at E3 this year. I would bet a large
3875840	3880480	sum of money on that. Why? Because Kinect has not lived out its full potential yet.
3880480	3885120	Microsoft's invested a lot in Kinect. Kinect is still, what's that record? It has the best
3885120	3889680	selling electronic gadget like ever, or fastest selling, I think, electronic gadget ever,
3889680	3895020	like more so than the iPhone. It's been crazy popular for them, but yet that hasn't really
3895020	3898800	reached his full potential. And they're on a 10 year console cycle. They've been stressing
3898800	3901700	that, and that's the whole plan with the Kinect anyway. Yeah, but Nintendo got away with not
3901700	3904720	doing that. But of course, Nintendo never said it was going to be a 10 year cycle for
3904720	3910320	them. Yeah, they never did. So, you know, whatever. But I just, no way are you going
3910320	3917100	to see a new, I mean, of course you might see maybe a redesigned 360 or a 360 with Kinect
3917100	3920760	built in. I don't know, you might see something like that, but I doubt it. I think it's going
3920760	3926200	to be just more Kinect support, and now it's not going to be so much about the dance games,
3926200	3930840	the biggest loser workout games, and those things. Now you're going to see the next wave
3930840	3937120	of quote unquote hardcore Kinect games, such as this rumored Halo reimagining that's going
3937120	3941240	to be done with Kinect. I think that's what E3 is all about this year. Now how do we take
3941240	3945680	Kinect to the next, like how do we make Kinect not so gimmicky? Because you haven't seen
3945680	3949960	just make it not gimmicky. I mean, that's it. I mean, what you need to do is, yeah,
3949960	3954700	you realize that you can do just because you can do something with the hardware doesn't
3954700	3961440	mean you should do something with the hardware. Like I don't before, you know, head tracking.
3961440	3966740	That's all you need to like for I don't understand why that's not even available for most first
3966740	3971360	person shooters nowadays is just have that support in there. OK, it does a little bit
3971360	3976680	of head tracking if you want to. That's it. That's all you have to add. I mean, if you
3976680	3981600	want to make it so you can throw a grenade by swinging your arms and cool, but it's not
3981600	3985720	really necessary because it takes a lot more time to swing my arm in a grenade motion than
3985720	3992600	it would to push a button. Yeah, so yeah, I just, you know, I think it's going to be
3992600	3997300	all about maybe this head tracking or whatever else technologies are going to put in future
3997300	4001840	games. That's what you're going to see at E3 this year. And of course, Dance Central 2,
4001840	4006040	you know, and sequels to the popular wave of first titles. But really, what Kinect releases
4006040	4012840	have we seen since Christmas until now? Very, very little. I mean, especially that's not
4012840	4017760	budget knockoff titles. Now granted, Child of Eden is kind of your lone standout point.
4017760	4022240	But that's not a Kinect only game. That's a game that has Kinect support. That's OK.
4022240	4027160	I still would consider that a Kinect title. OK, well, since Christmas, here's what we've
4027160	4035000	had. We've had Dance Paradise, which was a terrible dancing game from THQ. We had the
4035000	4040360	Michael Jackson Experience, which was kind of like Just Dance and a karaoke game. We've
4040360	4047240	had Fantastic Pets, which was a THQ pet sim game that, you know, it's kind of dumb. And
4047240	4052280	every game you've named so far is a derivative of one of the Christmas games. We've had...
4052280	4059480	We've got two Dance Centrals and Kinectimals. I'm trying to think what else we've had. Kung
4059480	4069800	Fu Panda 2, that's going to be a Kinect game. Michael Phelps, Push the Limit, that's coming
4069800	4074480	out in June. Whoopee. It's a swimming game. Nothing, nothing, I mean, you're stretching
4074480	4078280	to think of things. I mean, there's nothing that just jumps out at you as like an OMG
4078280	4084120	must own title. Right? I mean, all these are just little flashes in the pan because there's
4084120	4088620	nothing else on Kinect right now and people are hoping that they'll buy this crazy shit.
4088620	4092320	You know, people that crave new dance games are going to buy this Dance Paradise or what
4092320	4098320	have you. Dance Paradise is terrible. Don't buy Dance Paradise. How does it work? Dance
4098320	4102640	Paradise, it has your avatars in it, for one. So that's how you know that they're not taking
4102640	4111680	the damn thing seriously. Two, it's basically, it's got this interface that looks terrible.
4111680	4118920	You're standing, these kind of outlines of a person are kind of sliding towards you down
4118920	4122760	this. Kind of think of it like that Hole in the Wall show or something like that where
4122760	4128400	you have to move, make a certain gesture or something like that. Isn't that kind of how
4128400	4134520	Dance Masters works too? Sort of. But Dance Masters is less, you don't really know what's
4134520	4144680	coming up. I don't know. It's an interesting idea, but it's really way too Japanese-skewed
4144680	4152440	Dance Masters, that's for sure. But, yeah, there's not a lot out there. People are looking
4152440	4158160	for stuff. It's just, sadly, Michael Jackson Experience is actually probably the best title
4158160	4166080	out of the bunch so far. Because, I mean, it's got Just Dance as the core to it, because
4166080	4172480	that's basically what the game's built off of. But, I mean, I'd wait for chat. Some people
4172480	4176400	in chat are kind of knocking on it, actually. Kaijuto says, Michael Jackson Inexperience,
4176400	4180720	I call it, DDR dollar bill. I was pissed at the experience, not from the dance moves,
4180720	4185640	but from being forced, quote unquote, to sing. Those comments from our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
4185640	4192720	How can you be forced to sing? The Kinect has a microphone in it. That does suck. Alright.
4192720	4195160	You should be able to turn that off. Going back to the original story, though, about
4195160	4198860	the whole dev kit, actually, you know what's funny? I don't doubt that there actually is
4198860	4203720	a dev kit already at EA. I mean, if they are going to announce something next year, which
4203720	4209520	I'd see is a lot more viable, or maybe the year after, I mean, EA is one of the big,
4209520	4214360	EA and Activision is probably your two biggest publishers, probably have to already be thinking
4214360	4218820	about what launch titles they want to make for it. These games don't take two seconds
4218820	4225480	to develop. They're going to take some time. So, I actually don't doubt that they're there.
4225480	4229480	Of course these systems are already under development. You know, I bet EA has a pretty
4229480	4232920	good idea what to expect, but you're not going to see it this year. Well, of course not,
4232920	4238660	because, I mean, if anything, these are like alpha kits or something like that, because,
4238660	4245000	you know, let's say that they're sticking to the 10-year console cycle, okay? Well,
4245000	4251600	the 360 was out in 05, and, I mean, the way prices are coming down on all electronic stuff,
4251600	4257480	you know, God knows what technology is going to be in five years, or four years, I guess.
4257480	4261760	Almost five years. I mean, that stuff comes down in price so much, I mean, if they're
4261760	4266640	like building it off of specs right now, like say, okay, we're going to have a gig of RAM
4266640	4270760	in there or something like that, well, five years, you might be able to afford 16 gigs
4270760	4275640	of RAM for the price of that. Honestly, though, a lot of this depends on how much Nintendo
4275640	4279380	ups the Ani with what they're doing, because if they are hugely successful and they've
4279380	4282960	upped the Ani past the specs that 360 and PlayStation 3 has, it's going to force the
4282960	4286640	other two to work faster. Yeah, but I don't know if that's even going to be a big deal.
4286640	4289420	I mean, they're going to have a little bit of an advantage of being first out there,
4289420	4294080	but it's all about how they grasp and use it, but if they're just going to be like,
4294080	4299080	well, we're out here first, so we're just going to kick on back, because we don't have
4299080	4302960	to worry about competition. But here's the thing, though, they've got to be way ahead
4302960	4310000	of the game, because if it's just making it just a hair better than PlayStation 3 or 360,
4310000	4316600	it's all going to be gameplay then, and if they can't bring that to the table, then eh.
4316600	4320800	But I don't think gameplay's a problem for them, because before, they've all focused
4320800	4328120	on gameplay, and graphics have kind of taken a back seat, so if they bring all the visuals
4328120	4333840	and audio and stuff up to snuff, then they have a pretty good system there. But they
4333840	4339920	also can't play their games that they've been playing recently, where it's just like, oh,
4339920	4343640	let's re-release this. Oh, let's make the graphics on this slightly better and re-release
4343640	4347840	it again. Oh, hey, here's another game that's just like this other game. Oh, hey, look,
4347840	4354480	it's another Animal Crossing with the exact same stuff in it. Oh, we'll see, we'll see.
4354480	4359920	Alright, let's move on, we've got to get to the classic game of the week. Every week here
4359920	4364280	on Orange Launch Radio, DarkSakura takes a stroll to the classic gaming vault and digs
4364280	4369240	in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.
4369240	4372540	You know, there's no network, none of your newfangled networks right now to play things
4372540	4377560	on anyway. Except XBox Live. So you should go back and revisit this classic game. Dark
4377560	4383680	Sakura, what is the classic game of the week? The classic game of the week is Phantasmagoria.
4383680	4390600	Which was a weird ass game. Let's do some clips here if I can get to the point. I picked
4390600	4397560	one that like had some music, but then it went right into more talking. Anyway, Phantasmagoria
4397560	4405960	was on seven CD-ROMs for the PC and it was released in 1995, which was when I first played
4405960	4411920	it. I was my second year, no, my first full year of college. So it was, it took a lot
4411920	4416960	of time. I should have been studying. But anyway, it was one of the interactive movie
4416960	4424240	type games right in the height of the whole deal. And it used a live actress who her name
4424240	4429360	was a Victoria Morsell, which does sound kind of like a porn name, doesn't it? Miss Morsell,
4429360	4432920	will you please bend over for the camera? It makes me think of dark shadows. My name
4432920	4440200	is Victoria Winters. At any rate, like I said, it was on seven CD's because it was a lot
4440200	4446680	of video, a ton of video. And actually most of it was filmed in front of a blue screen.
4446680	4453160	There was something like several hundred different actions that the actress who is the main character
4453160	4457240	in the show, well not in the show, in the game, had to do, you know, like walking to
4457240	4463920	a night and picking something up, doing something. And also it had 550 pages of a script, which
4463920	4470000	is about four times the size of a regular movie script and an additional hundred pages
4470000	4476920	of storyboards for the 800 scenes in the game. It took four months of filming and 200 people
4476920	4481280	were involved in the productions. That's also including, that's actually not including,
4481280	4486000	sorry, the 135 people who were in the Gregorian choir for part of the music. And the last
4486000	4494080	scene took a week to film. But anyway, it was developed by Roberta Williams, who is,
4494080	4500680	she's actually behind King's Quest. And it was one of the goriest and most violent games
4500680	4505080	to come out in its time. I mean, it's got an M rating now. It had... Can I look at some
4505080	4509520	of these death scene YouTubes? I want to see how gory this game is. Okay. Let's see here.
4509520	4522200	I want to see some of this here. Let's put it up. Yep. So she's walking in front of like
4522200	4524760	this mirror that's doing a little swirly gas thing.
4524760	4540760	Can I give you a special feast, Regina? Oh, that's one of the murders.
4540760	4561120	Ew, he's like shoving all these organs in this chick's mouth and like forcing her to
4561120	4567840	eat them. This game's nasty. Basically the story, the main character is Adrian and her
4567840	4574160	husband, Gordon. And she's a paperback writer and he is a photographer. So they buy this
4574160	4583400	mansion that's owned by a 19th century magician named Zoltan Carnavash. And so basically through
4583400	4589880	the course of the thing, she accidentally releases this demon that had possessed basically
4589880	4600080	Carno, the illusionist, and it possesses her husband. So he goes on this big spree of being
4600080	4604920	abusive. He rapes her in one scene and then he gets more and more possessed and starts
4604920	4611440	killing people. And it turns out that this guy killed five of his wives. He had five
4611440	4617520	wives and he killed them based on how they were in life. Like one of them was into gardening
4617520	4622320	so he suffocated her with mulch and stabbed her with gardening tools. There was another
4622320	4626040	one who was an alcoholic so he shoved her in the eye with a wine bottle. There was a
4626040	4631560	talkative one so he gagged her and then broke her neck. And then this one... Oh my God.
4631560	4638400	Oh my God, this demon just put his hands in the chick's eyes and pulled her face in half.
4638400	4643960	This game's nasty. But she liked food and so he force fed her animal entrails until
4643960	4652200	she took to death. So his last wife realizes that he's a murderer so she and her lover
4652200	4656560	try to kill him except he comes back and kills them but they kill him again and then they
4656560	4669560	all die. So I don't know. Anyway, it's a lot of gore, a lot of really violent themes and
4669560	4678880	pretty, pretty hardcore stuff. And you're sick if you like this. This is so gross, Jamie.
4678880	4687280	This is a gross game. The reason why I'm bringing it up is because at that time it was really
4687280	4697400	novel for its time. It was really pushing the envelope. Fucked up? How about fucked
4697400	4703000	up? No, that's a good word. It was really fucked up. But for when it came out in 95
4703000	4709300	there weren't too many other games. I mean, basically you had Myst. It really did kind
4709300	4714280	of push the envelope and I think it's one of... I'd have to put it in... Grand Theft
4714280	4722560	Auto is nothing compared to that. Grand Theft Auto is my little pony. It's an angel food
4722560	4727280	cake made with whipped cream. I mean... I agree with Dungeon Buster in the chat room.
4727280	4733160	Fair to believe that King's Quest Williams did this. Clearly she had a dark side after
4733160	4737880	all those games about fucking fairytales. She's like, I can't take it anymore, gore!
4737880	4743760	More blood! More blood! Well, it also did get a sequel in 96 called Phantasmagoria,
4743760	4750000	a Puzzle of Flesh. Great name, huh? And you know, this actually came out in Japan for
4750000	4757920	the sake of Saturn. And it was completely re-dubbed in Japanese. It came out in 8 CDs.
4757920	4764640	And it was released by Outtrigger in 97 and it was just called Phantasm there. And Roberta
4764640	4771040	Williams was asked by Sierra to do a third game, but nothing happened. And she actually
4771040	4777960	said that Phantasmagoria is the game most representative of her game design career.
4777960	4784360	And there was a box set of both called Phantasmagoria Stage Fright in 1995. And actually it just
4784360	4791440	got re-released by Good Old Games in February last year as a digital download. I've actually
4791440	4795120	been totally considering because... So yeah, if you want to, if you want, if you, if you're
4795120	4799840	a sick person, you want to see this sick game, you can go... Oh, that's the final... Check
4799840	4806600	it out. Scene 2. Oh, this is like OMG Spoilers? Oh yeah, she, she... It was just labeled as
4806600	4817920	another death scene. Oh no. Uh oh. Oh my God! Gross! That's if you fail that. That blade
4817920	4824760	chopped her head in half. Yeah, but she uses it to kill him instead in the actual ending.
4824760	4832500	Sick people. It's, it's a really, really violent, bloody, gory game. But like I said, it was
4832500	4838840	really one that pushed the envelope in those days. A lot went into it. And for what it
4838840	4844440	is, it's a pretty good game. So now I wouldn't say it's too hard of a game. I mean with the
4844440	4849360	puzzles, but it was pretty good. I remember playing it when I was a lot younger and I'm
4849360	4853840	really glad I wasn't very good at it because I never got to any of this stuff. I remember
4853840	4856840	playing the game. I borrowed it from my friend, but I was like, I don't get this. I can't
4856840	4861800	play this. So I never got to any of like the really gory stuff. So I'm kind of glad because
4861800	4871480	this is sick. Yeah. Pornography. But it, it needed to be mentioned. All right. It is,
4871480	4876320	it is one of those classics. All right. Uh, that's going to do it for a part eight of
4876320	4879800	our show, but don't go anywhere guys. We're going to be right back with plenty more of
4879800	4883600	orange lounge radio. We got more stuff coming up in part B. We're gonna talk a little bit
4883600	4888720	about some of the pre E3 stuff that's going on. Uh, some news about Nintendo as well.
4888720	4892120	Lots of stuff, a little bit more. Wow. Cause the Warcraft did something important this
4892120	4896800	week. We want to share, uh, the mailbag as well. FUs of the week, your calls and tonight
4896800	4901680	a list list. So we'll take the topic. We'll get back with part B right here with more
4901680	4914240	of orange lounge radio. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio. We are live with episode
4914240	4919640	number 412. We're coming into part B. We've of course talked quite a bit about the whole
4919640	4923960	PlayStation debacle in part A. Uh, we're going to have a little fun with it here in part
4923960	4927640	B tonight. We're going to do some rapid fire news, some Twitter topics. You want to get
4927640	4931520	those in real quick and then a little later on we're going to get into tonight's list
4931520	4935080	list, which of course we have to poke fun at what's going on with PlayStation network
4935080	4941760	thing. PlayStation network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. So we'll
4941760	4944280	uh, be playing that game in just a little while. We'll tell you a little more about
4944280	4947480	listless and how that works if you've never heard it before. Uh, first we want to get
4947480	4951460	back into the show. Uh, I want to do some quick plugs though for the other projects
4951460	4959640	that we work on dark soccer. It's comic insanity and it's back. We recorded today. Yay. And
4959640	4970000	um, we, uh, go, uh, I'm stuck at promos today. We are on infamous.net and F A M O U S dot
4970000	4976640	net and you can download us every Tuesday where we talk about comic books and whether
4976640	4984640	or not we care about them and other geek worthy news. Awesome. It's me and Marin Marvel and
4984640	4990880	Dan shadow and we're awesome. Um, I want to also give a plug for my show. It's called
4990880	4994280	Horde House, the best little Horde house in Azeroth and it's about all things were the
4994280	4998320	Warcraft. So if the Warcraft chat earlier in this show just wasn't enough for you, there's
4998320	5002680	plenty more that happens with myself and extra for an extra for is very, very explicit. He's
5002680	5007600	more explicit than phantasmagoria, but with Dick jokes instead of blood. Extra for is
5007600	5013160	the guy who originated the term bleached asshole. Yes. Well, I don't know if he originated that.
5013160	5018360	I believe a stripper somewhere originated that, but he made it famous. Exactly. A horde
5018360	5023760	house.com H O R D E H O U S E dot com. A couple other plugs I was asked to give here. Rama
5023760	5027920	said, please plug anime jam session. And I said, sure. Visit our friends at anime jam
5027920	5034240	session. You visit their website, anime jam session.com. Anime video games, cons, cosplay,
5034240	5038120	everything in between. Just throw it all in a blender and there you go. Anime jam session.
5038120	5042000	Although it, it sounds a lot better. Trust me, it's, it's actually pretty cool. So check
5042000	5046200	that out. They've got a fun little show there. Also, um, my buddy say joined chat and one
5046200	5051280	of the big things he works on every year is OOM loud, OOM loud. It's very loud. It's a,
5051280	5058040	uh, a child's play fundraiser. Uh, it is rock band all night long and it has a date for
5058040	5062320	this year, December 8th. Now I missed it last year and I was pissed, but you know, real
5062320	5066280	life happens sometimes. Uh, but I'm really trying to make it this year and uh, I hope
5066280	5070160	you guys can make it too. Book your flights now. It's going to be fun. December 8th. Uh,
5070160	5074680	of course it was same, same place. DNA lounge, same city, San Francisco, California, but
5074680	5080500	more rock. All right. Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news and uh, go around and do some
5080500	5084920	quick stories and then we'll get to the tweets, twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, this is kind
5084920	5090320	of unique. Um, of course with the new rock star game, LA noir coming out next week, they're
5090320	5097380	kind of, um, I don't know, tying this in with the release of that. They have some collected
5097380	5104600	stories that they're releasing on a, an ebook format and you can check it out. It's basically,
5104600	5112840	uh, an anthology, um, of collected, uh, Hollywood tales from authors like a Megan Abbott, Joyce
5112840	5119600	Carol Oates and Jonathan, uh, central for, I don't read books, so don't know who these
5119600	5125160	are. But, um, apparently though, I guess they're going to be kind of like 19, I mean 1940s
5125160	5131520	noir detective novels. So that's kind of cool. And uh, the first one, of course they have
5131520	5137800	a little sample you can check out of, um, the, uh, the girl, which is, uh, Megan Abbott's
5137800	5142560	book. That's going to be the first one coming out and you check that out on a rock stars
5142560	5149080	website, rockstargames.com slash LA noir, um, slash features slash stories and they'll
5149080	5155280	be right there. And a pretty cool, uh, idea, I guess they're going to have, I guess eight
5155280	5163760	total. Um, and I'm definitely checking out that game when that comes out next week. And
5163760	5170800	then this is also pretty cool. Uh, with a copy of battle LA on Blu-ray, you can also
5170800	5176120	get an early access to the resistance three demo that'll be on the disc. Uh, the demo
5176120	5183680	will be a 30 minute demo that was, I believe shown off, um, earlier this year. Um, I guess
5183680	5188360	back in March they were showing some of that stuff off and, uh, the game looks pretty awesome
5188360	5192320	and you know, it kind of ties in with battle LA since, you know, you're battling aliens
5192320	5196480	in the United States and stuff like that. Um, so if you really want to check out that
5196480	5202000	and maybe you just want to buy the movie cause I hear the movie's decent, you know, um, that'd
5202000	5206880	be the way to go. So, uh, that's coming out June 14th and I actually probably will pick
5206880	5211560	that up cause, uh, watching, I mean, I have to pick it up and make it for free cause I'm
5211560	5219520	lucky like that. Um, and then, I love Volition and, uh, their Saints Row and Red Faction
5219520	5222680	games. I actually haven't played too much of Red Faction, but I really should. But Saints
5222680	5226400	Row, I mean, it, they're just very over the top with everything. I don't know if you guys
5226400	5233840	remember from Armageddon, um, or, uh, Armageddon, uh, Guerrilla last year they had a, uh, April
5233840	5238280	Fool's weapon that they released that actually became a real weapon that was an ostrich.
5238280	5243320	It was, uh, a melee weapon that you hit people with an ostrich and that was pretty awesome.
5243320	5249480	Um, well now they have, uh, the new weapon which is called Mr. Toots. It is a unicorn
5249480	5255600	with, it looks like, you know, My Little Pony or something like that, that you pull on its
5255600	5261960	tail and it shoots a rainbow out of its ass that makes people explode. Just awesome. That
5261960	5267400	was in a video that the guy who did the portal video did where he gets a portal gun and his
5267400	5273520	friends will care. Yeah, well, that was tying in with this, of course. Um, and, uh, Mr.
5273520	5278760	Toots, of course, is, um, isn't going to be available right away. It will be available
5278760	5283960	though if a million people download the demo that is available right now. So, after one
5283960	5288960	million downloads of the Red Faction Armageddon demo, Mr. Toots will be unleashed for all
5288960	5297020	to use. And that is awesome. You know what? I gotta say, with, uh, a unicorn that shoots
5297020	5301760	rainbows out of its ass, they're really gonna have to step up their game for, you know,
5301760	5307400	Postal 3. Cause I'm sorry, a chainsaw badger? I ain't cutting it anymore. Now a chainsaw
5307400	5313800	honey badger. They've gotta make a game based on honey badger at this point. It was already
5313800	5317960	angry, er, Naughty Bear. They could do pissed off honey badger. Sorry, they need to make
5317960	5323840	a good game based off of honey badger. Alright, uh... Naughty Bear was a terrible game, by
5323840	5328640	the way. Yeah, the iPhone one is pretty bad too. Okay, anyway, other tweets, er, I'm sorry,
5328640	5333120	not tweets yet. We're almost to tweets, but other rapid fire news. Uh, this game, apparently
5333120	5336900	it's a rhythm game. For those of you kids that like your rhythm based games, uh, there's
5336900	5342520	a new game coming out called Pulse Volume 1. Uh, this is a game for the iPad. And I
5342520	5346280	guess what this is, it's stationary rings that are in the center of the screen. Each
5346280	5349840	ring is larger than the last with the smallest set in the center. And then the number of
5349840	5355000	rings increase with each difficulty level. Now as a pulse ring grows outward from the
5355000	5359640	center, orbs follow along the stationary rings. And as the music plays, pulse rings appear
5359640	5365000	and reach the orbs to the beat of the song. Scoring is based on the accuracy of orbs hit
5365000	5368200	in correlation with the pulse reaching them. Hmm, this could be interesting. So here's
5368200	5371880	a little bit of the gameplay. You can kinda hear what some of the music sounds like. You
5371880	5376560	can see, it's kinda neat. Like, each pulse is kinda like one measure in the song and
5376560	5382880	you gotta tap all the little lines. It's kinda like, I don't know, elite beat agents meets
5382880	5394400	a map of the solar system. There you go. That's Pulse. Uh, some news from Harmonix. Uh, stories
5394400	5399800	about the, uh, Rock Band download content and where they're at, uh, after the post MTV
5399800	5406040	Games breakup. Uh, a quote from, uh, Chris Rigopoulos, who is the Vice President of Strategy
5406040	5410560	and Business Development. Uh, he was interviewed by Game Informer saying that, quote, they've
5410560	5414880	effectively severed all ties with MTV and all proceeds from Rock Band belong to Harmonix.
5414880	5418320	Now this is important because many people thought that, well, the reason why they were
5418320	5421640	getting such awesome download content to begin with was because of their partnership with
5421640	5426600	MTV Games. Now, he continues to say that it has been a collaborative effort between Harmonix
5426600	5431860	and MTV in the past. Uh, all the stuff you've seen this year so far, most of that was before
5431860	5436840	Harmonix was sold by Viacom. Now, the new tracks that'll be coming out soon, that's
5436840	5440560	gonna give you the first glimpse at some of the music that the company has secured without
5440560	5444320	MTV. And I think Jamie's gonna cover that in a minute. And it still sounds pretty good
5444320	5448440	stuff, but I love this. Uh, he doesn't expect that there's gonna be any drastic changes
5448440	5453920	to the music selection process, but, quote, I doubt you will see any more SpongeBob SquarePants
5453920	5459080	packs. Ouch. So I guess that was not something they wanted to do, but they did anyway. Well,
5459080	5464840	yeah, that makes sense, you know. Viacom, you know, I think it's Nintendo, or not Nintendo,
5464840	5470560	Nickelodeon, MTV, yeah. Uh, also, speaking of Rock Band, this is very important, there
5470560	5475520	will be no Rock Band 4 this year. Yeah, I'm not surprised. Uh, yeah, kind of file that
5475520	5480440	under duh. I mean, it took a couple years for Rock Band 3, uh, but they are not gonna
5480440	5483600	be doing a Rock Band 4 this year, and I'm kinda not surprised because, you know, Guitar
5483600	5488260	Heroes on hiatus, Rock Band 3 unfortunately didn't sell well, and it's, it's a bummer
5488260	5493560	because it's a great title. It's down to 10 bucks at Toys R Us now. It's, honestly, you're,
5493560	5498720	if you like music games in the slightest, you've gotta get Rock Band 3, it's awesome.
5498720	5504700	So take advantage of the $10 sale, I suppose, uh, and go check that out. Uh, probably this
5504700	5508840	year's at E3 you're gonna see more from Harmonix, like Dance Central 2 will probably be their
5508840	5514840	big title. Maybe something unannounced, who knows? Uh, maybe something to take on a different
5514840	5518240	type of music game. We'll see, you know, there's always been that rumor that they want to review
5518240	5521760	and revisit the amplitude frequency type of games. That could always be something they
5521760	5526920	show. Got a DJ game would be awesome. We'll see. So, but, uh, no Rock Band 4. Maybe next
5526920	5531520	year or the year after that when people are back into music games. I would say it's gonna
5531520	5537600	take until whenever the next series of systems comes out, but we'll see. Dark Sakura. There
5537600	5543760	is a PS3 bundle coming out for Black Ops in three weeks. Um, Call of Duty Black Ops will
5543760	5552940	have one that has 100, that, uh, excuse me. It's, let me start over. There is a PS3 bundle
5552940	5557600	with Black Ops arriving. It's Call of Duty Black Ops on PS3. It will have 160 gigabyte
5557600	5565940	hard drive and will be 300 bucks. And, uh, hopefully we will hear something from Activision
5565940	5573220	and Sony soon, but this is still just, uh, coming from retail. 100% true. Okay. Super
5573220	5580640	Meat Boy level editor is out. Yay. So you can go and, uh, download it. It's on Steam.
5580640	5587680	Make some levels, share them with everybody. And they better not suck. And in the... They'll
5587680	5593080	all be hard as hell. You know, cause people... Aren't all the levels hard as hell? In Super
5593080	5601460	Meat Boy, yeah. Well, there is a, of course, another Rock Band pack coming out, uh, this
5601460	5608600	month here in May. There will be tracks from, uh, the Foo Fighters album, uh, Wasting Light.
5608600	5612860	And then, uh, there will be pro guitar and bass upgrades to older Rock Band tracks. There
5612860	5620540	will also, um, be, uh, some Lady Gaga. Are you happy, Rob? Absolutely. Cause you know
5620540	5625160	I'll be singing that in the privacy of my own home. And Peter Frampton. I live with
5625160	5630220	someone now. Oh well, they can deal. It's Do You Feel Like We Do, which is from Frampton
5630220	5636660	Comes Alive, which my former stepfather had that album. I love that they have from Lady
5636660	5642760	Gaga to Peter fucking Frampton. Oh, and Ozzy. There will be Ozzy. You know what? I want
5642760	5650660	some damn Lita Ford. I want the Ozzy Lita Ford duet. Close My Eyes Forever. I love that
5650660	5655580	song. You know what I would like to see in Rock Band, especially now that they have piano?
5655580	5660860	Meat Loaf. Yes. Yes. We need the Rocky down like that. Well, they did have some Meat Loaf.
5660860	5664260	I thought, like, around Valentine's Day they had some Meat Loaf stuff. Oh my god, maybe
5664260	5670060	I missed it. I think there's, um... I'm checking the list of Rock Band downloads now. I know
5670060	5677140	that there's a couple of, uh... In fact, you were excited about one. I wanna say. This
5677140	5680420	is important information. I need to know what Meat Loaf songs are available. This will complete
5680420	5686620	Rob's life. It really will. Just do a search. Control F Meat Loaf. Or I could just alphabetize
5686620	5692900	the list and then scroll down to M. H I J K. I'm gonna say F. There's Megadeth, Megadeth,
5692900	5697780	More Megadeth, Screwed. Oh, one Meat Loaf song. One Meat Loaf song. Paradise by the
5697780	5702980	Dashboard Light. Cause you were giddy about that. That's not enough Meat Loaf. There's
5702980	5707120	always room for Meat Loaf. Meat Bat Out of Hell. Wouldn't it be great if we had the Rocky
5707120	5712180	Download Pack? I thought there was a Rocky song in Rock Band. No, it was in Guitar Hero.
5712180	5715260	There's, uh... I think there's songs in Guitar Hero, but I don't have Guitar Hero. We need
5715260	5719580	the whole thing for Rock Band. That would be great. That would be awesome. And we need
5719580	5726580	the trumpet. We need the saxophone controller next. Alright, any more news? No. Alright,
5726580	5732000	well if there is, I don't care. Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics then. Every week
5732000	5737220	we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r because of course this is the show where
5737220	5743060	every gamer has a voice. Let's go to the first tweet tonight from uh... we already covered
5743060	5746980	that story. So we'll go to M. N. Zeba. Ooh, I remember reading about this too. M. N. Zeba
5746980	5753700	tweeted us saying, the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword GDC 2011 trailer music played backwards
5753700	5759100	is very familiar. So apparently... It wasn't to me. A person who, you know, I'll let you
5759100	5766100	get into that. Alright, so here it is, played backwards. And this is backwards right now.
5790100	5797100	Now, that's a little tune from Ocarina, right? Is that why? Yes, I did. People were flipping
5798060	5802860	their shit about this? Yeah. Once again though, me not really giving a crap about Ocarina
5802860	5807120	of Time, that was totally lost to me. I was like... But it's this whole setup because
5807120	5812520	we have the Ocarina of Time re-release coming out first. Eh, big deal. Alright, well that
5812520	5818220	was a tweet from M. N. Zeba. Alright, Blue Swim tweet says, rumor has it that Namco Bandai
5818220	5823820	Games America has licensed Sailor Moon? And he tweets us to a site that he actually works
5823820	5830140	for. But I'm assuming he's going on good authority. Oh, I see. Sailor Moon World Italy apparently
5830140	5835460	is the source here. Some new companies have evolved, acquired licenses for Sailor Moon
5835460	5839980	and one of them is Namco Bandai Games America. Oh boy, I hope we get a Kinect Sailor Moon
5839980	5846160	game that we can do the transformation. Dark Sakura, would you play that? Maybe. I'm not
5846160	5852140	that acrobatic. You know you would. Alright, Silver Sonic tweets us to a story about, what
5852140	5858480	else, Sonic. Sonic Generations rumor coming to Nintendo 3DS. A portable version of Sonic
5858480	5863940	Generations coming to the 3DS. Apparently it's from a GameStop report that shows upcoming
5863940	5869220	skews and it's listed for the very end of the year, a placeholder end of 2011 date.
5869220	5877380	So there you go. So some folks are yelling at me in chat that I didn't go through the
5877380	5883500	whole video. Well what am I going to see if I go through the whole video? Alright, tell
5883500	5886320	me what I'm going to see and then I'll go back to the whole video. Alright, going to
5886320	5896860	DJ Rama S tweets us saying, IGN acquires UGO. No one, Ker. No one, Ker. Great, the corporate
5896860	5905580	collective grows bigger. Congrats. Now they own 1UP and IGN. Yep. Congrats. Yep. Alright,
5905580	5911140	let's see, Tiger Claw links us to a few stories here. Valve is starting to look at Steam Mobile.
5911140	5916300	Oh that would be kind of neat. Like a mobile based Steam store. I'm assuming that can't
5916300	5921220	really compete with the iPhone. I mean, excuse me, it would compete with the iPhone but it
5921220	5925660	can't be on the iPhone I suppose. Or maybe it could. I guess you could always do something
5925660	5930340	like that because if you sold it through the Apple store and then it could have the add-ons,
5930340	5934260	I don't know. But I don't know if that's what Valve would do. Anyway, Valve is saying that
5934260	5938100	they're looking at the possibility of bringing Steam to mobile devices. According to this
5938100	5943940	story, it's from Trademag MCV and I guess it's something that the Valve marketing vice
5943940	5948180	president Doug Lombardi says that the more requests that Valve receives for a mobile
5948180	5954180	version of the platform, the more likely it is to act. We'll see what happens with that.
5954180	5959320	At least you know you get some hella good sales on that. All right, let's see. Tiger
5959320	5965620	Claw 305 also links us to Smithsonian announces lineup for art of video games exhibit. Oh
5965620	5969620	that's kind of cool. That's right, the Smithsonian was supposed to be doing something with that.
5969620	5975500	So it's running from March 16th of next year through September 30th and yeah, that's pretty
5975500	5981060	awesome. So the Smithsonian, which is funny because remember that whole video games aren't
5981060	5984660	art debate that went on a couple years ago. Well now they're going to show video game
5984660	5989580	art in the Smithsonian. So I don't know. I think that kind of ends that argument. By
5989580	5993860	the way, there's a quote here that sells the exhibition quote. Video games use images,
5993860	5997700	actions, and player participation to tell stories and engage their audiences in the
5997700	6002100	same way as film, animation, and performance. They can be considered a compelling and influential
6002100	6007180	form of narrative arts. New technologies have allowed designers to create increasingly interactive
6007180	6011540	and sophisticated game environments while staying grounded in traditional game types.
6011540	6016260	The exhibition will feature 80 games through still images and video footage. There will
6016260	6019660	be five playable games in the exhibit. Pac-Man, Super Mario Brothers, The Secret of Monkey
6019660	6024420	Island, Myst, and World of Warcraft. There will also be video interviews with notable
6024420	6030480	game developers, large prints of screenshots, antique consoles, 3.7 million votes cast in
6030480	6037620	a poll over 175 countries. There's 80 games in the exhibit including Zelda, Donkey Kong,
6037620	6042660	Doom 2, but there are some missing. This article calls out Space Harrier and Beyond Good and
6042660	6048300	Evil. But you know what? When there's only 80 games, sadly some good ones are probably
6048300	6053780	going to be lost by the wayside. All right. A few more tweets for you guys here. JV Mon
6053780	6058460	tweets us about Thomas Howard. Remember Thomas Howard Lichtenstein, I think his name is,
6058460	6066340	of DDR fame. Remember that? Apparently, it's a song with Disco Warp. They were in DDR universe
6066340	6071620	and this is some type of indie band collaboration here. I guess they're all straight out of
6071620	6093020	Portland. So here's the song. Oh my gosh. There's too much noise in that song. There's
6093020	6096500	just too much noise. I'm just picturing a lot of 13 year olds at a rave now. So where's
6096500	6100540	Thomas Howard coming to that? I imagine he sings at some point, but I don't know if I
6100540	6104100	can get to that point. I'm not saying a song is bad, but I'm just saying it's a lot of
6104100	6108820	new. Maybe the middle is a little bit different. Oh, is it the wrong song? Oh, JV Mon said
6108820	6116020	I played the wrong song. My bad. Well, I clicked the link you sent me. All right, here we go.
6116020	6131620	Let's try this one instead. Is that like the anti-auto tune? Why? Why did they do that?
6131620	6148300	It's okay. Too many effects. You don't need it. That was better than the first song, but
6148300	6154780	yeah, it's just, uh, don't need all the effects on there, buddy. All right. Uh, let's see.
6154780	6160460	Last tweet here from Salacious Pop. Jack's beef jerky, ew, uh, is running promos for
6160460	6166020	Xbox live arcade and Hulu plus. I got three months gold for 1295 and a month of Hulu plus
6166020	6174300	for free. Any thoughts? Okay. First off Hulu plus is, it sucks because you're paying to
6174300	6178120	watch commercials and I don't like that at all. I mean, yes, they have a big archive
6178120	6183680	of shows, but you know, so does Netflix and I think there's plenty of stuff to watch on
6183680	6187780	there and the internet. Uh, also the other thing to keep in mind, the Hulu plus interface
6187780	6192580	on Xbox fucking blows because they've done that whole crossbar thing with Hulu plus and
6192580	6198780	it doesn't work. The crossbar thing does not work for everything and Hulu plus and Facebook
6198780	6201680	and Twitter and all this other stuff they try to integrate next, but that crossbar thing
6201680	6208820	does not work for it. Uh, so yeah, I guess you can set up a queue online to do Hulu plus
6208820	6212020	and that's kinda, I guess the way you're supposed to do it. But did you know that a lot of the
6212020	6216500	stuff you can watch on the web, you can't watch on your Xbox. It's not licensed for
6216500	6226940	playback on the Xbox. No more reason why Hulu plus is kind of dumb. Sorry. Um, or yes, or
6226940	6233980	you could set up your queue and then download diversity. Of course you have to buy diversity
6233980	6238500	I suppose, but you can download, I'm sure a streaming program and link it with that
6238500	6242260	and you can actually stream all that stuff through there. Uh, some comments in our chatroom
6242260	6246020	at chat.orns lounge radio.com. Uh, Black Wolf says you have to give your credit card
6246020	6251100	to get the free month. Oh, uh, break man says I like Hulu pluses TV selection, but the movie
6251100	6255780	selection sucks. Salacious pop clarifies the biggest draw to Hulu plus is that they let
6255780	6260380	you watch shows on demand that are still current from just last week, et cetera. You know how
6260380	6267260	else you can watch shows that are still current Torrance or, or most of them are on like cbs.com
6267260	6272540	has most of the CBS shows and NBC. Most of them are available that way, but like the
6272540	6277180	real, real stuff like HBO, like if you want to watch, I don't know what the tutors or
6277180	6282980	any of that showtime. We just got HBO actually because we have upgraded our Comcast, whatever,
6282980	6285660	because they're going to give us the same thing. Plus our phone for the same price we
6285660	6290740	had already, but they gave us, they give us a Gaga concert last night. Yeah, that's the
6290740	6297860	thing though. They gave us HBO, but it doesn't work because we were, we're like, okay, what
6297860	6301940	should we watch? Oh God concert. Okay, well we don't have anything else to watch. So we
6301940	6307020	clicked on that. This channel is not available like, but they were supposed to give it to
6307020	6311460	us for free for three months. So great. There's something else that's wrong with Comcast.
6311460	6316340	Hooray. But Hey, we have a DVR now. So that's in our chat room says, or you could watch
6316340	6322380	it on the TV. If you want to watch a current show, you could turn on your TV and watch
6322380	6326860	it. That's a good point. We caught up on the office lesson instead. I watched survivor
6326860	6330340	live every week. I don't have a DVR anymore. I don't record shows. So if I don't watch
6330340	6336980	it live, I'm either watching it on cbs.com or Netflix or Hulu.com the free version or
6336980	6344260	something. Torrance are great. Or if you want to get into this century with the piracy,
6344260	6349960	um, use net or, you know, the file share sites are way better and faster. By the way, I think
6349960	6354380	I should be on survivor because like, seriously, this season is driving me bonkers because
6354380	6359060	there's all these bimbos on that show that are totally being controlled right now. I
6359060	6366700	can't stand it. I'm just saying if I went on that show, I'd be the one in charge. Bitches
6366700	6373700	better watch it. That's right. Watch it. That's it for tweets, twitter.com slash O L R. Uh,
6373700	6378100	let's move on to some more news. Listless coming up in just a moment, but first a round
6378100	6387140	of stories. Yeah. Um, so Kami's planning this sort of party or I don't know. Um, they're
6387140	6393420	doing a pre E3 show on June 2nd, I guess a few days before E3 starts. The event will
6393420	6397860	be streamed online. They haven't said which sites yet. Um, and there's going to be, I
6397860	6405540	guess, um, like a sitting room where people can watch trailers for stuff and they're also
6405540	6413420	going to have like, uh, parties in LA, San Francisco, Toronto, um, Sao Paulo and Mexico
6413420	6419060	city and other cities. They haven't really finalized this list of cities yet. Um, and
6419060	6423340	apparently they're going to be inviting the press and stuff like that to these things.
6423340	6431620	Oh, I guess we need no fucking invite. And you know, I can, I can, I can understand that,
6431620	6435300	you know, uh, you know, what whole LA thinks that's, that's fucking far and they're not
6435300	6438740	going to pay for us to fly in there. But San Francisco, man, that's like, that's like an
6438740	6445980	hour or two away. And whatever, you know what, I don't give a shit about your fucking Yu-Gi-Oh
6445980	6451820	game that you have there. Um, so yeah. And then I think also on their Facebook and stuff,
6451820	6456660	they were doing this contest where like, be the ultimate Konami fan and tell us why you
6456660	6461780	are the ultimate Konami fan. You can win like an iPad or, you know, a trip to E3 or some
6461780	6468540	crap like that. So, uh, more on that I'm sure as we get closer to the states, cause obviously
6468540	6472740	they haven't really announced too much other than, Hey, we're going to be, uh, doing our
6472740	6481700	first annual pre-E3 show. So not really niche. Maybe we can make a drinking game out of that
6481700	6489100	too. That'd be fun. We could. I mean, obviously they're going to be showing what, um, the,
6489100	6495300	uh, Melger Solid, um, Rising Game, which still hasn't come out. So that, that's probably,
6495300	6503300	you know, one of the big things. Silent Hill Downpour. That'll be another big one. Um,
6503300	6507020	that's pretty much it. I mean, I guess, I guess they're bringing No More Heroes over
6507020	6517300	here. They're localizing that for the PS3. Um, so they'll show that. But we've got our
6517300	6523660	Dance Masters game. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if anyone caught some of my tweets
6523660	6529940	earlier this week. Uh, you know, I, Red Bull in the Morning does some weird things to my
6529940	6538900	brain, but I got this wonderful, weird idea of pitching a game to Konami, you know, like
6538900	6545340	fixing DDR, I guess, you know, making it, rebooting, rebooting, I guess. Um, that's
6545340	6550220	the hip thing to do in Hollywood these days, rebooting it. And I don't think it's that
6550220	6555420	far off. Obviously, it's gonna be a hell of a lot of work, and I need to, um, do that
6555420	6560540	right now. But first, you gotta get somebody's ear. Good luck with that. No, not actually,
6560540	6565380	because, um, you know, do the pitch first, then get the person's ear. Or copyright your
6565380	6573140	idea first, and then, that's how you do it. Do it the smart way. But, yeah, just because,
6573140	6579460	I mean, come on. I mean, I actually did the math, and this is great, and might as well
6579460	6584500	bring this up, since we're talking about it. And just to kind of show you real quick, um,
6584500	6591540	or demonstrate how, how the franchise has fallen. For example, I did the numbers. According
6591540	6599860	to the NPD reports, January 2011, this would be everything from 2010 and back, um, their
6599860	6606180	game series. Okay, so let's start with, um, on the Wii. Hottest Party sold 2 million units.
6606180	6609620	That's a little over 2 million units. The original Hottest Party in 2007. Original Hottest
6609620	6621380	Party. 08. Hottest Party 2. 1.5 million units. 2009. Hottest Party 3. 390,000 units. 2010.
6621380	6627780	Dance Dance Revolution. Remember their kind of reboot thing. 170,000 units. And then on
6627780	6634420	the Playstation 3, Dance Dance Revolution, 60,000. You know, combine, and compare that
6634420	6641540	to, you know, um, you know, oh, and Dance Master is only 47,000 units. Oh, wow. Compare
6641540	6648100	that to Just Dance 2, which came out October, which was about a month before, uh, Dance
6648100	6655060	Dance Revolution. 3.5 million units sold. That's more than all of, well, the first two,
6655060	6661740	uh, Hottest Party games combined. So, it's sad, because they could really be, they're
6661740	6665500	just not putting a lot of effort into it anymore. Uh, Brakeman in our chatroom asks, what the
6665500	6669940	F is Hottest Party? Is that one of those AO games? Now, that would be an awesome way to
6669940	6674780	reboot the series, don't you agree? Uh, DDR Dolla Bill in our chatroom says, I didn't
6674780	6678540	even know DDR kept getting releases until someone gave me the step mania files. Maybe
6678540	6682260	that's part of the problem. The community's been kind of, like, if you go to DDR Freak,
6682260	6685900	you'll see the tumbleweed rolling by. I mean, there's not nearly the community they're used
6685900	6689220	to, you know. But I don't think they really need necessarily the community for it. There's
6689220	6695940	not a big community for Just Dance. True. I mean, it's all about being current, and
6695940	6699820	I think what the problem's been is they've been trying to innovate with the series, and
6699820	6703100	they just don't know how. They don't really know which direction to take it in, so they're
6703100	6708260	taking it in all the directions at the same time. You know, they're like, oh, okay, we're
6708260	6714980	gonna innovate by adding 8 panel dance mode, or something like that. No, that's not what
6714980	6720900	you do. They're trying to shove square pegs into the round hole. Exactly. That's the problem.
6720900	6727100	And I think, I don't know. I have some good ideas. It's hard to describe them over the
6727100	6733300	radio because it's all in my head right now, and I've tried to, like, sit down and type
6733300	6740680	out what I'm thinking, but if I can get what's in my head on paper, it's gonna be awesome.
6740680	6746580	That's the problem. But I have some fresh ideas for it, so see if I don't get bored
6746580	6753540	of this whole idea and actually finish it and be able to pitch it. It would be awesome.
6753540	6757120	But yeah, once again, you know they're not gonna give a shit if they're not, you know,
6757120	6761340	if they're just, you know, they don't want to try, then that's fine. So folks in the
6761340	6766020	chat room are commenting that folks moved on to other websites, like Bamani style and
6766020	6771060	so forth, but those websites are not just about DDR, and usually DDR seems to not be
6771060	6774720	the focus at all. You know what I mean? So that's why DDR is continuing to plummet. Other
6774720	6779220	games might be doing okay. Like, DJ Max Portable got released in the US because of the following
6779220	6784980	it has here, but, you know, DDR is a different game. The thing is though, it's, you know,
6784980	6789180	Dance Dance Revolution was kind of like the innovator, you know, it brought, you know,
6789180	6793820	kind of people to the genre first, and then, you know, now they have these other games
6793820	6798220	out there, and they're doing really well. And that's not to say that Dance Dance Revolution
6798220	6802700	can't do very, you know, that well, even if it did half as well, it would still be way
6802700	6807320	better than what it is now. And so that's the thing is, all they have to do is figure
6807320	6811700	out how to capture that audience, and I think I know how to do that, just based off of what
6811700	6815980	they've done and what hasn't worked. And what has worked, and you just kind of combine all
6815980	6819120	the, they have all the pieces there, it's just, they're not doing it right. Well I want
6819120	6823860	to know, I hope you get your audience with Konami someday. Alright, let's move on. A
6823860	6827760	couple more stories for you guys, yeah, buy stock. I actually thought about buying stock
6827760	6834220	in Sony, just so I could sign a petition to shake up the management, but we'll see. Alright,
6834220	6839100	anyhow, quick, quick story about Quake and Wolfenstein. Yes, some old, old properties
6839100	6843780	that are, you know, very near and dear in a lot of First Person Shooter fans' hearts.
6843780	6850860	An interesting comment from senior producer Jason Kim when Shaq News spoke with id Software,
6850860	6854620	I call him ID Software, some people call him id, quote, our studio has grown a lot, not
6854620	6859920	just in size, but also in design and art process, and even a technology standpoint. John Carmack
6859920	6863340	has admitted that he can't do everything on his own. There are a lot of smart guys that
6863340	6867700	are required to be able to make a game these days. We have Quake, we have Wolfenstein.
6867700	6871460	If people want that, we have the IPs to deliver it, and we have a different approach now.
6871460	6875100	We're forging a new path. I think we can freshen those things up. We don't have anything in
6875100	6878340	the works right now, but I think when we start talking about different things we can do with
6878340	6882060	the other properties that we have, I hope people are receptive to what we want to do,
6882060	6887260	and what we think would be fun for players to experience coming out of id Software. Well,
6887260	6890860	I mean, there was a new Wolfenstein game not that long ago, and it wasn't very remarkable,
6890860	6896300	and then there was a, the Quake Arena on Xbox Live's pretty cool, but the Quake 4 was not
6896300	6900260	cool actually, it was not that great, because that was on Xbox 360, right? Yeah, it wasn't
6900260	6905820	very good. So, uh, yeah. We'll see. I mean, I'm all for going back to the drawing board
6905820	6910340	with new ideas, and those are two big properties. I used to love Quake back in the day. And
6910340	6914420	Quake 3 and Quake Arena are actually a lot of fun, so. Did you ever play Ascii Quake?
6914420	6920500	No, I never played Ascii Quake. But, I remember the old Quake CD. I always got to Quake. I
6920500	6927740	got to Doom. People have a lot of free time on their hands, what can I say? Alright, so,
6927740	6931820	speaking of a lot of free time on our hands, a little segment we like to do on this show
6931820	6939220	once in a while is a segment where we try to come up with the definitive list on a topic.
6939220	6943460	That's right, after we're done tonight, we are going to go through a list and find out
6943460	6953120	the exact top 3 scientifically proven answers to a topic. It's a process we call listless!
6953120	6957460	The way listless works, since we haven't played this in a little while. We're going to give
6957460	6961700	you a topic, and the topic tonight is thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back
6961700	6966220	to make me care about it again. And then the 4 of us, yes we're going to get someone online
6966220	6970620	in just a moment, the 4 of us will go around the room and each give our top 3 answers as
6970620	6974820	to what should be on that list. That will leave us with a list of 12. Then, the hard
6974820	6980300	part, oh this is the hard part, but you know reality shows are all about voting things
6980300	6984780	off, so we each go around and take one thing off the list. That leaves us with a list of
6984780	6990740	8 that you the chatters get to vote on, and you vote for your top 3 and that's it, that's
6990740	6996260	the list. That's the answers right there. Tonight's topic, thing PlayStation Network
6996260	7000260	needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. You can give your answers in our
7000260	7004020	chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, I can't guarantee we'll use them, but when one
7004020	7007660	of our hosts is struggling to find an answer or if something gets duplicated, we'll usually
7007660	7012100	turn to the chatroom. Alright, let's bring in our 4th person here, I'm going to go ahead
7012100	7016980	and give them a call. Let me dip the Skype line down here, or I'm sorry, let me dip the
7016980	7019620	music down here for just a minute so we can call on the Skype line. I've got somebody
7019620	7027060	set up here. Hello. Hi, is this Tiara? Yes, it is. It's the one and only Tiara aka Marin
7027060	7032540	Marvel joining us tonight. You might have heard the commercial for pop culture parlay
7032540	7037020	in between the segments tonight if you were listening live. Tell us real quick about,
7037020	7043140	pimp your projects, Marin Marvel, before you play with us tonight. Well, as you know, I
7043140	7048340	steal Jamie about once a week and we do Comic Insanity, which is a comics and kind of like
7048340	7054220	a geek culture podcast where we talk about fun stuff. And then there's Pop Culture Parlay,
7054220	7060980	which is just kind of a little bit of craziness where Weasel aka Jonathan Long, who works
7060980	7067780	for EA, and myself kind of talk about different pop culture stuff. We've done like Star Wars
7067780	7073540	versus Star Trek. We've talked about the best Batman. We've talked about all sorts of random
7073540	7079420	stuff. So it's just really, really fun. Really, really good time and that's on geek-life.com.
7079420	7084000	Awesome. Well, best of luck with all those projects. You know I like to sometimes poke
7084000	7088580	fun at the stuff you and Dark Sakura do at the Giggling Girls show, but you guys do very
7088580	7092420	hard work. So best of luck. All right. You ready to play listless with us tonight? I
7092420	7097720	sure am. Yay. Then I can play music again. All right. Of course, the topic tonight,
7097720	7103060	Thing PlayStation Network could do to get me to come back once it, or I'm sorry, wait,
7103060	7107460	what was the exact thing I wrote here? Thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back
7107460	7111940	to make me care again, because you know, it's been 18 days. Most of us now are used to a
7111940	7116780	life without PlayStation Network. So what is it that they can do to make me give a care
7116780	7120100	when they come back? They've been talking about this welcome back program. Let's see,
7120100	7123900	we're going to go around the room and get the top three. We will start with, we'll let
7123900	7127620	the ladies go first. Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. What is your number three answer
7127620	7136620	on the list? Thing they could do to get you to come back? Mind control via nanobots. Mind
7136620	7139980	control via nanobots. How would that work with a PlayStation? By the way, your answers
7139980	7143220	can be as serious or as silly as you want. That's part of the fun. Because I have a first
7143220	7148020	model PS3, so clearly it has the hardware inside of it to create nanobots based off
7148020	7152420	of data sent in through the PSN once it comes back up. And what would be the first thing
7152420	7157500	you'd mind control? No, it would mind control me to care. Oh, okay, I see, I see. Yeah,
7157500	7162300	it would mind control me to care. Okay, there you go. Alright, Mar and Marvel, we'll go
7162300	7166900	to you. What's your number three answer? Thing that PlayStation could do to get you to care?
7166900	7173860	Well, since there's all this talk about how, you know, our data has been like stolen, maybe
7173860	7178220	they could give us like a year of free credit reporting so that we can keep an eye on our
7178220	7183380	credit and like make sure that those people that are stealing our information aren't like
7183380	7188900	buying things from Nigerians and stuff. To be fair, they sort of did, but I think you're
7188900	7192380	talking about something a little more intense than what this whole Debex thing is about.
7192380	7198100	Debex is credit monitoring, but not credit reporting. So there is a difference. All right.
7198100	7201940	All right. Just want to clarify the difference for our listeners because you know how internet
7201940	7207620	people will be. They'll say, dear orange lounge radio, your guest was uninformed. All right.
7207620	7212820	Anyhow, let's move on. My number three answer thing that PlayStation Network could do. How
7212820	7218940	about a PlayStation two emulator download for my collection? Yeah, they've been rumored
7218940	7224380	to work on one of those for years. I'd like to see that come out. So PlayStation two emulator,
7224380	7229380	I don't care how they have to get it to work. Just get it to work. If you want me to care.
7229380	7233500	All right. That's my number three answer. Loki, what is your number three answer? Uh,
7233500	7239820	here's the problem is I don't really care. Um, but so I'll just try to pick popular answers
7239820	7248180	instead. This one will go for Rob, uh, upping the cap of members allowed in the PlayStation
7248180	7253740	home clubs. I like say a billion. That would be perfect. That is a practical answer. I
7253740	7259300	love that. Cause right now in the orange lounge radio club, I'm allowed to have 25 people
7259300	7262960	when I have people that's not a club. I don't want to sound cocky. We have a little more
7262960	7268100	than 25 people that listen to this program that have a PlayStation three. So I would
7268100	7272260	really like to be able to invite more people because unfortunately we've got a list of
7272260	7277700	about, I'm, I've shit you not more than 25 waiting like invites. I can't do anything
7277700	7282180	with them because I'm limited. Of course, I don't know what we would do in the PlayStation
7282180	7289660	home club. I just want to have a big club. Let's go to dark Sakura place or excuse me,
7289660	7294060	your number two answer for the listing PlayStation network could do to get you to care, morph
7294060	7302540	the system into a dream cast to has been left in the other room. So it would just instantly
7302540	7308500	transform wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. And it's a dream cast to outstanding with a big Sega
7308500	7314980	logo flipping off PlayStation via a firmware update. All right, Martin Marvel, your number
7314980	7327820	two answer. I would like a new attachment for the PS three that serves frozen yogurt.
7327820	7331540	It doesn't have to be Pinkberry. You know, I'm not, I'm not a snob here. You're not asking
7331540	7336500	for the world. Just frozen yogurt. All right. I like that. A new attachment that will serve
7336500	7340980	frozen yogurt. I like that answer. All right. Uh, let's see my number two answer for thing
7340980	7346300	that they could do, uh, to get me to care about PlayStation network. Uh, guardian legend
7346300	7352340	two released as a PlayStation network exclusive. Of course, the greatest, most underrated eight
7352340	7359700	bit game of all time. Guardian legend two would have to come out as a PSN exclusive.
7359700	7364100	That would get me to care and it better be better than that blaster master remake they
7364100	7372060	had on week is that was not the quality of my need. That was weak. I see what you did
7372060	7378980	there. Good one. Loki, your number two answer. Uh, once again, like reiterate, I really don't
7378980	7386540	care. Um, I guess since it would make a lot of people happy and probably end a lot of
7386540	7393660	their problems, just bring back the, uh, Linux support or other OS, I guess, you know, here's
7393660	7397780	a thought, Sony, you could, you know, you could patch that so that, you know, maybe
7397780	7403580	it doesn't allow you access to everything. Why is that? See, I never understood that.
7403580	7407460	Let's just get rid of the whole Linux support instead of, I don't know, patching it so that
7407460	7412060	it doesn't allow people to hack us. You know, I can't, I can't for the life of me believe
7412060	7417060	that amongst all this talk of frozen yogurt and mind control, Loki is the voice of reason
7417060	7424060	tonight here on orange lounge radio. Am I in bizarro world? What is going on? Anything
7424060	7434300	from them. What do I want? It's like a blow job. That's what you want. No, I Sony blow
7434300	7445220	job. Really? I mean, that would be unsatisfying. I could tell you that much. All right, here's
7445220	7452100	the list as it is so far. We disabled the good feature, you know, we disabled the humming
7452100	7458900	feature mind control via nano bots. We disabled the feature that will swallow. All right now,
7458900	7464260	mind control via nano bots. Give us a year of free credit reporting, PlayStation two
7464260	7469620	emulator downloading, upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs, morph the system into
7469620	7475180	a dreamcast to walla walla walla new attachment that serves frozen yogurt, guardian legend
7475180	7480940	to PlayStation network exclusive and bring back the other OS feature. All right, let's
7480940	7485820	go around and get the number one answers from the folks here in studio, dark soccer, number
7485820	7493420	one thing that could bring you back a year of pink berry, a year of pink berry with this,
7493420	7497100	with this actually come out of the PlayStation three, like Mara Marvel suggested, or would
7497100	7502260	this be just a coupon redeemable at your local store? It would be like a card that's got
7502260	7508420	like 365 charges on it for pink berry. I speak because I like going to pink berry and listening
7508420	7520500	to the music. All right, Mara and Marvel, your number three answer. How about some free download content, like for people who, for like, you know, co-op games and games that you play online.
7520500	7523780	So since people have missed all that kind of stuff during this whole debacle, they can
7523780	7528980	get some free download content and make up for not shooting things. I'm sorry. And of
7528980	7533260	course, that's the number one answer. I just shortened that to free download content of
7533260	7541700	good games. Yes. As opposed to like, you know, undertow. All right. Free download or, or,
7541700	7547500	uh, Yaris. Okay. Free download content of good games. All right. My number one answer
7547500	7551160	to the question thing placed it, by the way, I have to read this comment from salacious
7551160	7556440	pop. A Sony blow job is $30 more expensive from a similar competent brand. And the no
7556440	7561540	toothy head feature has to be ordered from a neighboring store and costs even more. All
7561540	7567060	right. My number one answer for thing PlayStation network needs when it comes back to make me
7567060	7577860	care about it again. Drum roll, please. Gay pornography, which is even more fun than funny
7577860	7582300	than straight pornography. All right. That was my number one answer. Gay pornography
7582300	7588100	would get me to care selling, selling gay porn on the end. Yeah. Okay. So that all you
7588100	7593420	like, you know, straight guys at home, they're going fine. Lesbian porn galore. Just les
7593420	7601260	bows are us is what the PlayStation store renames itself to enjoy. All right. Loki,
7601260	7607020	your number one answer for the thing placed in network could do to get you back. Um, give
7607020	7615460	a fuck about it. Um, you know, this is, those even have to be free and it's not even necessarily
7615460	7619540	something that they give to me, but it'd be kind of cool if they put out a new AIBO, I
7619540	7626980	guess. I mean, I don't know. I really Loki. Why not? I mean, okay, everybody point and
7626980	7634220	laugh at Loki. I don't know. I just like, I, I don't care that their networks now cause
7634220	7641180	they never used it. The thing you want most of the world. Loki is a new AIBO. Not really.
7641180	7647020	I actually, I would like, no, scratch that. Let's screw. Screw the AIBO thing. All right.
7647020	7654620	All right. Okay. Thing I would like most from Sony thing from Sony. They have really no
7654620	7659740	power to do this, but I would like the clerks animated series back on air. So, you know,
7659740	7664900	maybe they could, you know, make that happen. That would be awesome. All right. So get the
7664900	7671220	clerks animated series back on air. All right. Much better answer. All right. So let's recap
7671220	7675900	the list. Here comes the hard part. You guys, we got to take one off the list. I'm sorry.
7675900	7679940	It's just the way it works. It's a, it's a, it's tough love folks. It's tough love. Here's
7679940	7685700	the list is a stand so far. Mind control via nanobots. Give us a year of free credit reporting
7685700	7691140	PlayStation two emulator, downloading upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs morph
7691140	7696700	the system into a dreamcast to walla walla walla walla new attachment that serves frozen
7696700	7703540	yogurt guardian legend to PSN exclusive. Bring back the other OS feature. Did I cut out for
7703540	7708980	a minute? Sorry. Bring back the other OS feature. A year of pink Berry, free download content
7708980	7716220	of good games, gay pornography and clerks animated series back on air. These are all
7716220	7721300	things that could actually happen. I like how SSJ 100 Matt says won't happen. Disney
7721300	7727620	has the rights to it. Who said this is realistic at all? SSJ 100 Matt. This is what we want.
7727620	7732720	They have to, I don't, I don't give a shit that Disney own it owns it. Make it happen.
7732720	7736500	By the way, let's read some of the comments from chat here. Uh, let's see what were some
7736500	7741160	of the stuff. Uh, break man says, cause her eye kills a puppy. Anytime someone mentions
7741160	7744340	free games on his network. That's not an answer. We wouldn't want to kill puppies. That's not
7744340	7749460	going to get us do anything. Uh, bonds 006 agrees. Make PS3 backward compatible. Uh,
7749460	7756140	SSJ 100 Matt make president cap playable for the move. Uh, dark Tetsuya says make PlayStation
7756140	7761620	network out of bacon. Uh, lots of good answers there in chat, but unfortunately we've got
7761620	7767100	to go through the list and figure out what is not worthy of the list. So dark Sakura,
7767100	7780940	which of these items is not worthy of the list? It's going to be tough. Um, bring back
7780940	7785500	the other OS cause I don't give a shit. All right. She's striking what is probably the
7785500	7792940	most logical answer on the entire list. Bring back the other OS feature. It has been stricken
7792940	7797820	from the list. All right. Uh, Marin Marvel, hopefully you have the list in your mind.
7797820	7801740	You know what you want to take off. Which one of these is not worthy of the list? Well,
7801740	7806420	personally I don't want my brain controlled by nanobots, so I'm going to have to go with
7806420	7813100	that one. All right. So mind control via nanobots. It has been stricken from the list. Uh, the
7813100	7817940	answer I'm going to have to remove from the list. I'm so sorry, but when you have pink
7817940	7822680	berry and frozen yogurt on the same list, pink berry wins. So I have to eliminate the
7822680	7827700	new attachment that serves frozen yogurt. Attachment that serves frozen yogurt could
7827700	7834060	serve pink berry. I'm just saying the PS three is too hot. It's a George Foreman grill, so
7834060	7838380	it has been removed from the list. Sorry. All right, low key. Which one of these is
7838380	7852500	not worthy of the list? A lot. Um, no offense. Uh, I'm going to have to say, uh, so wrong
7852500	7862660	but uh, yeah, I'm going to have to say free download content of good games. It's just,
7862660	7868860	come on. That's a cheap way out. Free download card. Here's a dollar. Screw that. All right.
7868860	7874500	So here is the list as it is right now. Give us a year of free credit reporting. PlayStation
7874500	7879660	two emulators down that one. Oh, well being the cap of members allowed in home clubs morph
7879660	7883900	the system into a dreamcast to wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall. Guardian legend
7883900	7890060	to PlayStation network exclusive a year of pink berry, gay pornography and clerks animated
7890060	7894440	series back on air. How did gay pornography survive? Well, I don't know, but it's your
7894440	7898660	turn to vote. There's the list in the chat room. Send a private message to sky with your
7898660	7903300	vote with your number one and number two most wanted answer. Please label your one and two
7903300	7907540	choices as one is worth more. So there you go. Send a private message. We'll tally them
7907540	7913860	all up and we'll let you know the winners right after the mailbag loot Mara Marvel though.
7913860	7916780	As for now, we are going to go ahead and say goodbye, but thank you so much for playing
7916780	7920500	with us tonight. No problem. I'm sorry. Half your list got eliminated, but that's what
7920500	7924860	happens sometimes. Yeah, that's all right. You still did a great job and best of luck
7924860	7929460	of course, with your other projects. Thank you very much. All right, take care. Bye guys.
7929460	7933100	All right. Thank you. Of course to tear. She's filling in very last minute too. Cause I put
7933100	7937620	this on Twitter like 30 minutes before. So there you go. What's with the slacking? Huh?
7937620	7941060	Cause it's cause someone didn't have their show. Roll stories up till about 15 minutes
7941060	7950580	before that. No, someone texted you hours ago and said blah, blah, blah, blah. All right.
7950580	7953700	Let's move on. We have a few more stories for you guys and we're going to get to the
7953700	7963620	mailbag Loki. Ah, fun stuff. Um, so rumors, I got to get into more rumors. Of course,
7963620	7969220	you know, everybody's Jones in the sea. What the hell exactly is going to be a part of
7969220	7974260	the new Wii system? And uh, there's a lot of speculation out there, a lot of unnamed
7974260	7980660	sources and whatnot. So take this with a big grain of salt. But, um, apparently here's
7980660	7983820	some of the rumors. Uh, they're saying that it's only going to have eight gigabytes of
7983820	7988740	storage on board. Kind of think of it like the flash based storage that they had already.
7988740	7992940	Um, they're saying it's going to be augmented though by SD card support. So kind of think
7992940	7996420	of like the Wii was just a little bit bigger than eight gigabytes. You don't compare that
7996420	8003020	to like say the Microsoft, um, you know, Xbox, the new system. Um, you know, that has four
8003020	8008820	gigabytes built into some of them. So that's not too bad. Um, they're saying that the storage
8008820	8016100	space is going to be on the actual disks. It's going to be using, um, some 25 gigabyte
8016100	8022140	disks are saying maybe like a single layer blu-ray disc. Um, although they're not really
8022140	8029940	saying what type of disk format they're using. Also that, uh, the 10 ADP output is not necessarily
8029940	8035180	a definite. It might be, you know, lower than that, seven 20 or something. Um, honestly
8035180	8040620	though, if they're going to be pushing visuals that are better than Sony and Microsoft, they
8040620	8045620	really do need to do 10 ADP I think at the very least. Although they're saying that it
8045620	8056380	might be 10 ADI. So I, I, come on, don't skimp on this shit. That's all I got to say. But
8056380	8061020	of course we're not going to really know until the dam system comes out. So let's let the
8061020	8065300	wait. All right. You just have to wait and see and wait one more month. Exactly. And
8065300	8073540	then, um, I don't know. I'll be interesting. I have a feeling when I think of Nintendo
8073540	8077940	announcing the system at during their press conference, all the only word that comes to
8077940	8085100	my mind is disappointment. So I'm expecting disappointment. All right. Well there is some
8085100	8088860	good news I guess to talk about. It does have to do with world of Warcraft, but this is
8088860	8093140	good news. They have a released in the world of Warcraft store. They're little, I know
8093140	8097100	you all love this word, but microtransaction store they've got going on, uh, between now
8097100	8102820	and July 31st, if you buy their latest in game pet, which is the Sonarian hatchling,
8102820	8107420	I believe cute. I believe it's based off an old, old Mount that was available at one time,
8107420	8111300	but now it's a little pet. And if you buy this Mount or I'm sorry, excuse me, this pet
8111300	8118280	for $10, 100% of that $10 will be donated to the red crosses, Japan earthquake and Pacific
8118280	8122220	tsunami relief effort. Uh, there was a big call for blizzard to do something like this
8122220	8126860	because obviously, you know, they've sold mounts and things like that strictly for profit
8126860	8127860	before.
8127860	8131820	They've also done sales where half the profits go to something. And I believe they recently
8131820	8136000	said, uh, they sold the Moon King Moonkin hatchling patent not that long ago and they
8136000	8141940	gave half the proceeds to make a wish foundation. And I believe it raised $800,000. So imagine
8141940	8146380	what a hundred percent of the proceeds you're going to raise for this very needed cause.
8146380	8150020	I mean, even, even now, I mean, I realize you're not seeing it every day in the news,
8150020	8154180	but that doesn't mean it was cleaned up overnight and everybody is suddenly, you know, all better.
8154180	8159700	That's not how this works. So, uh, I'm glad there's continuing to do things for, uh, Japanese
8159700	8164800	tsunami relief. That's great. And just the power of it's nice to see good news about
8164800	8172420	games and plus just the power of a beast like world of Warcraft, you know, so very cool.
8172420	8176340	All right, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag out
8176340	8180980	orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer likes to dive into the mailbag. Get your letters
8180980	8187500	out and read them right here in the segment. The OLR mailbag. Um, just for the record,
8187500	8191540	I'm not reading anything related to PlayStation at work. Uh, making that disclaimer ahead
8191540	8196060	of time. Hey guys, it's blade three. I just wanted to say thanks for everything again.
8196060	8203980	And if you could reprimands, I guess reprimand or completely extricated video game or company
8203980	8212500	EG or Ubisoft and why you would do that. Okay. Wait, which company would we rep reprimand
8212500	8221500	out of them? And if you could, I'm not getting the context on here. What are we reprimanding
8221500	8227900	them for? You've been very naughty. I have no idea. We do that all the time anyway. Thanks
8227900	8231340	again guys. Keep up the fantastic work and Loki rock piece guys. This message brought
8231340	8236500	to you by make employees I work with make rocks look like Einstein. Uh, we would reprimand
8236500	8242220	them all when they deserve it. That's, that's how these things work. Hey, OLR or OLF orange
8242220	8247220	lounge video. Long time no type. I wanted to show you a picture of a Navajo taco. There's
8247220	8252260	sometimes called Indian tacos. Is there a picture? Oh, this was a, this is a follow
8252260	8261620	up to the email from last week. This image has been removed for security reasons. Owned
8261620	8267620	owned by the security filter taco. Hold on, hold on. There's an easy solution to this.
8267620	8273740	Watch. I'm going to go to google.com and I'm going to click on images and then I'm going
8273740	8282380	to type na va ho taco. I'm going to hit enter and there it is. It's like a, Oh, this is
8282380	8286460	like a Mexican pizza type of thing. But let me re finish reading this. Then you think
8286460	8291640	of that taco bell entree, which is not the same. Okay, I get it. Fortunately, I couldn't
8291640	8295300	find any pictures of a Navajo taco that I've made in the past, so I had to settle for one
8295300	8300780	off google search. I am Navajo myself, so I make these quite often. Navajo tacos are
8300780	8306340	similar to a normal taco with a few of exceptions. One, you use fry bread, sometimes called fried
8306340	8311100	bread in place of the taco shell. It's not a Navajo taco without our, without fry bread.
8311100	8314860	Two, beans are added, usually refried beans. They're really good and much bigger than a
8314860	8318860	normal taco. Sometimes you can fold them, eat them like an actual taco. Some people
8318860	8323620	use a fork and knife if they're too big. I usually eat them like a pizza. Oh Rob, your
8323620	8328540	comparison was astute. When I introduce someone to a Navajo taco, they fall in love. If you
8328540	8334020	want to try one of these, I suggest checking out the next powwow that might be in your
8334020	8340860	area. You know what, now that you've mentioned it, I have had one before. I had one, um,
8340860	8347620	in Alabama at the Creek Indian Powwow, but that's not what they were called. Okay. But
8347620	8350460	you can find people making these tacos there most of the time. Don't get them from any
8350460	8354380	carnival or fairs. They're not usually the best tasting there. That's all I wanted to
8354380	8363740	share. I'll let you guys get back to gaming. Happy eating AJ twist of unfocused podcast.
8363740	8369360	Well thank you for the email. And that Navajo taco did look yummy. I really, really freaking
8369360	8379300	want a taco, Rob. Alright. Okay. Uh, oh yeah, we already covered the, uh, well this comes
8379300	8385940	from Rababa, but it's about the, uh, Smithsonian exhibit and I'm just going to skip the, uh,
8385940	8390060	winners list and go right into the bulk of the email. I disagree with some of the choices
8390060	8394260	which are moot points. The one I think is obviously a wrong pick is Pac-Man for the
8394260	8398460	Atari 2600. I hope they critique about the lack of advanced techniques for graphics in
8398460	8403220	the overly short development cycle for that game. Seriously, I hope that they show the
8403220	8407900	progression of detail shifting from highly stylized artwork like on adventure or haunted
8407900	8414300	house to in game art. I always kind of wish that they would make, that they'd make a new
8414300	8419580	space invaders with the yeti like aliens throwing lightning bolts from the side of the arcade
8419580	8424080	cabinet. I also hope they show the graphic art design on different publishers game boxes.
8424080	8436740	I will definitely go see the exhibit. Pictures. Um, don't care. Sony's getting sued. Of course.
8436740	8442340	Like I said, I'm not reading anything about the, um, PlayStation. Ho and Spazinator sends
8442340	8449660	a follow up email. That's the one that, okay. The one on Monday he said not to read. Disregard
8449660	8458380	it. Okay. I just had everything pulled up. Okay. Um, more about PlayStation. Sorry Rababa.
8458380	8462820	Last email to Sky Dark Sakura and Loki. Have you ever bought a game just for the sake of
8462820	8466940	having it? I mean, yeah, you bought the game to play it, but you bought it more for the
8466940	8471660	fact of having it for your collection than to actually play it. Thanks. Peace out Ranma.
8471660	8477340	Good question. I have all the time. I got Dan, the Gunstar heroes on a Game Gear. I
8477340	8484500	don't think he's opened it yet. I bought Metal Gear Solid four because I got it for a really
8484500	8489360	good deal. I got it for 20 bucks when most places were still selling it for 50 at a radio
8489360	8493900	shack that was, uh, on clearance with all their games in Hawaii nonetheless. And I've
8493900	8498460	not played it to this day. I got a forgotten realms D and D game because it came with a
8498460	8504920	game with a gaming module. It was a big PC one. At the first, um, loud. I bought collector's
8504920	8508520	editions of burning crusade and wrath of the Lich King. Granted the burning crusade one
8508520	8512900	was all autographed, but I gave it to someone for a Christmas present. And then I kept the
8512900	8517060	wrath of Lich King one, which I actually still haven't even used because I already had it.
8517060	8522980	So I just bought it for the, I actually do have my final fantasy 11 beta discs still.
8522980	8527580	Nice. Yeah. Loki, anything you've ever bought just to have for your collection? Like, I
8527580	8537180	don't know, a Japanese three years and not play it. Yeah. Um, well I bought like three
8537180	8547020	copies of, uh, earth defense force, but there were cheap. Um, I've played this about once
8547020	8554980	or twice. President cat. Nice. I want to borrow it. Sure. If we can get it to work on my system.
8554980	8563140	Can't without a mod ship. Well, then she's going to have to borrow the, we do can't wife
8563140	8569940	is playing animal crossing. Don't. All right. Uh, is that it for emails? That's it. Mailbag
8569940	8575180	at orange lounge, radio.com. Now I know you're all dying to know the results of tonight's
8575180	8581740	list lists, so let's get to the results. We have the definitive list. You guys, these
8581740	8585620	are, this is it. These are the three things we want. Actually it's for tonight cause there
8585620	8590820	was a tie, but these are the things that we demand for us to care about. PlayStation network
8590820	8597100	when it comes back up online. Number three, a PlayStation two emulator download. That's
8597100	8602000	the number three. Number two, it's a tie. The number two thing you most want that will
8602000	8607420	bring you back to PlayStation network. The clerks animated series back on the air and
8607420	8614860	gay pornography. Yay porn. And the number one thing that could get you to come back
8614860	8623460	and give a shit about PlayStation is if it were to morph into a dreamcast too. Yay. There
8623460	8629180	it is. The definitive list. Dream cats again. Number thing, PS two emulator. Number two,
8629180	8634220	clerks and gay porn tie. And number, that's the only time you'll ever hear me say that.
8634220	8638980	And number one, morphing the system into a dreamcast too. That's it. No arguing. We're
8638980	8646780	done. Just something troubling went into my head. What? Clerk says a gay porn. Not funny.
8646780	8654380	Black Wolf says I voted for lesbian porn. What's it? It's lady gay. Same diff. Gay with
8654380	8661740	boobs. That's right. I'm moving on. These are all formalities. Uh, we're going to get
8661740	8666060	to the ranty part of the show. It's the part of the show we call the F use of the week.
8666060	8689020	Rawr. Dark Sakura. Um, F you to me not having any tacos right now. I really want fish tacos
8689020	8693580	from Carolina's, but I don't want to drive out and get them. I got you that last week.
8693580	8704060	I know. I want, I really taco and finals freaking finals and four hour rendering and Maya bite
8704060	8714860	my butt. Loki. Um, my head hurts. Guess if you have that, I guess the show makes your
8714860	8721820	head hurt. Yes. Uh, my F you goes to myself for staying up until four 30 in the morning
8721820	8727420	yesterday. I was driving home from the Bay area very late. That was kind of dumb, but
8727420	8731980	I slept until noon today and that part was awesome. There we go. That's the F use of
8731980	8736140	the week. Just a couple more stories for you guys. And then the Skype line, we're going
8736140	8740740	to open it up at one eight seven seven game O L R or a username on Skype. Orange lounge
8740740	8746660	radio will be open just after a couple more stories. Loki. Um, one of the things Nintendo,
8746660	8753860	I guess was bad about for this generation of games was launching really big titles around
8753860	8758780	when third parties are launching. They're really big titles, thus stealing away sales
8758780	8764300	from these other third parties that they're working with. Um, apparently, you know, they
8764300	8768060	were kind of stepping on their toes. So what they're doing now, at least they're promising
8768060	8774980	to do is, um, that the three ds versions of super Mario and Mario cart, uh, they said
8774980	8778300	they want other companies to be successful in order to accomplish this goal. They're
8778300	8783980	going to dedicate or decide on dates after they know what the release plans of other
8783980	8788000	companies are so that they can be considerate to them and so that they can all maximize
8788000	8795380	their sales, uh, for the short term. So that's kind of cool at least. How considerate. Yes.
8795380	8800940	Um, well, I guess that's one way to help, you know, get third parties on board for your
8800940	8808220	new system and it would not fucking them over like that. That'd be awesome. Awesome. All
8808220	8812860	right, well, uh, one more story for you guys and it has to do with the useless peripheral.
8812860	8820500	Yay. This is a peripheral by CTA digital and it's going to cost you $13. Guess what it
8820500	8829460	is? It's a steering wheel for connect. You know, that's not as bad as the, the inflatable
8829460	8833860	boat. That w that thing was fucking awesome. But uh, here it is. This is the coolest thing
8833860	8839780	about it. It's translucent. It's a see through steering wheel because I guess with the connect,
8839780	8843620	you don't want the connect to see the steering wheel. It's only going to see your hand. Okay.
8843620	8849140	Who drives the steering wheel up at their face? I mean, are you, I'm not going to mention
8849140	8852900	anything because that's just only going to be racist if I do anything like that. I drive,
8852900	8857380	I just drive with one hand on the steering wheel usually, but connect doesn't recognize
8857380	8862540	that. I have to drive like a regular person like 10 and do you have to drive like you're
8862540	8870820	a bad actor. Exactly. So there you go. Uh, make sure you preorder that right away. Hey,
8870820	8877180	guess what folks, if you want to be able to do such things as drive without, you know,
8877180	8882100	with a steering wheel peripheral, you know what you can do? You can get anything to act
8882100	8890740	like a steering wheel, just a stick, a plate, you know, an actual steering wheel, a car,
8890740	8899180	a kitten, you know, a taco. I mean, why do you need to buy? Oh my God. Dark soccer. They
8899180	8905480	need to power video games with tacos. They need to power me with tacos. One eight seven
8905480	8910340	seven game. O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. By the way, black
8910340	8914200	wolf wants to clarify in the chat room. I tried playing joy ride using the Mario cart.
8914200	8919020	We wheel and it didn't work, so that's why it's translucent. I see. Well, we'll trick
8919020	8922580	those infrared beams after all. All right, the calls are coming in already. Hi, you're
8922580	8927220	on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's your local plug for Ronda. Of course. Of course
8927220	8930860	you get in the Skype line first too. It's like you have a gift. All right, what's on
8930860	8936420	your mind, buddy? Before I begin, I just got one thing to say, Rob. Yes. A blender, really
8936420	8942460	a blender. What's wrong with the blender? This just proves to me that you have been
8942460	8950700	listening to the show. I will confirm or deny nothing. Okay. I'm going to make this quick
8950700	8956740	and so, and move it along. Okay. Yes. All right. First thing in response about Nintendo's
8956740	8963260	next gen controller, I would be just happy if they just took the original super NES controller,
8963260	8968820	put two analog sticks on there and a little touch screen and I'll be happy. Okay. Touch
8968820	8973380	screen. I don't really see the point of that, but if you need a super Nintendo controller,
8973380	8978260	two analog sticks, that'd be called the classic controller. That's all we need, but I can
8978260	8983100	understand. I'd be happy with the super Nintendo controller with a fleshlight attachment. That's
8983100	8991900	what I'd be happy with. Oh God. Nintendo's going to deliver an experience like never
8991900	8999140	before. This is only adults only. Fuck you kids. We don't need you anymore. You said
8999140	9006780	we were hard corn off. Well, fuck you. No, seriously. Fuck you. I'm waving the flag over
9006780	9016940	here. It's the Nintendo fuck you coming up this Christmas. That's a pretty catchy name.
9016940	9033340	Where were we? I'm sorry. See low green to sing the theme song. Oh God. Ah, yes. Oh,
9033340	9036300	hold on. I'm sorry for the dead air here, but I'm setting something up here. Hold on.
9036300	9041740	Here we go. Oh no. All right. Let's see here. If I can, uh, Oh God damn it. I can't. Okay.
9041740	9049100	Here we go. Ah, nevermind. The joke's derailed now. All right. What do you want? Oh, there
9049100	9059060	we go. Coming this Christmas from Nintendo, the company that brought you such hardcore
9059060	9068340	games as the legend of Zelda. It's the Nintendo fuck you. What were you talking about? Touch
9068340	9072940	screens. But on retrospect of that, I said the next gen console should be called the
9072940	9078500	Nintendo. Simple as that. Oh God. It's going to be some really retarded, like Nintendo
9078500	9087560	HD or like, I mean, cause seriously the, the DS, the 3DS. I, um, I would, I, if they're
9087560	9092900	going with this whole Facebook route, I would say it's going to be called Nintendo.com will
9092900	9101180	be the name of this. Here's how it will be. The Nintendo HD. So HD, lowercase I, lowercase
9101180	9114520	I. What? Get it? It's like the Wii. Nintendo HD. Oh, D. Oh, HD. Boy. Oh boy. What do they
9114520	9118580	need to put in a Nintendo console to make you a really excited around my, or are you
9118580	9124580	just excited on principle? I want more 2D Mario brothers cause I'm sick of the 3D Mario
9124580	9129900	games. I'm sorry. I thought Mario 64 was great. And then I got tired of it. You mean to tell
9129900	9134580	me I'm sitting here going through the level eight times to get these stars. That's it.
9134580	9140760	I'm done. Nope. No more of that. Yeah. Well, what about all those people that are like
9140760	9146580	Mario 64 is the best game ever made. I'm going to plead the fifth amendment on that one.
9146580	9153380	Oh, that means, uh, I should play the Cielo song again. All right. Yes. All right. Well,
9153380	9157540	any other thoughts for listeners tonight? Oh yeah. I did find out something that before
9157540	9161520	Activision canceled the entire Guitar Hero franchise, they were actually working on one
9161520	9167140	more game. Well now it could come back someday. They've left the door open a crack. They haven't
9167140	9172060	shut the door on it completely. Yes. It's called Guitar Hero Grateful Dead edition.
9172060	9176660	It comes with five songs, 20 minutes each and the collector's edition comes with a one
9176660	9181420	pound bag of weed. I was going to say there's the punchline has to be like a pound of coke
9181420	9191620	or a pound of weed. No Motley Crue version comes with a one pound bag of crack. And a
9191620	9203580	straw. Now that's living the rock star experience. All right. On that note, Rama, we'll let you
9203580	9211500	go. Bye. Take care. One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange launch
9211500	9215460	radio, but there's already calls coming in. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9215460	9220860	Good evening, OLR. This is blue swim. Hey, blue swim. What's on your mind, buddy? I was
9220860	9229140	wondering if you guys heard about the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure. Is it is it interesting?
9229140	9235020	I mean, well, I don't want to sound rude, but like, you know, we tried to get all the
9235020	9240100	details a couple of months ago and weren't very successful. It was kind of like trying
9240100	9246980	to I don't know. All right. Well, what's the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure? Actually,
9246980	9254820	it is going mobile. Oh, OK. Yeah, I seem to remember something about the whole thing where
9254820	9259260	they were going to. Yeah, I remember him saying he was trying to strike deals with people
9259260	9263540	like Android and iPhone and all that stuff. So it's going mobile, huh? Yeah. Looks to
9263540	9271060	be iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Windows seven phone with Android to follow. And it looks
9271060	9277740	like it's going to come out on June seventh. Wow. Ninety nine cents. Didn't say anything
9277740	9286140	about price, but it's going to have new levels, new music, new features, and the Xbox version
9286140	9291780	is going to get it as well. Oh, interesting. So they're going to upgrade the existing one
9291780	9297060	or there's going to be an all new one. From what I'm seeing, it looks like it will be
9297060	9301700	upgrading the original on the Xbox Live indie games. Nice, because I already bought that
9301700	9304780	one, so that would be cool. By the way, if you've never played Techno Kitten Adventure,
9304780	9308220	it's a disgustingly simple game. You play a kitten that's flying through the air to
9308220	9311980	techno music and you just don't want to hit a wall or you'll hear a little meow. Actually,
9311980	9314860	I should fire up a clip. It's been a couple months, right? We're all ready to hear the
9314860	9319420	song again, right? Hell yeah. Let me fire up YouTube here. Now, where did you read about
9319420	9324540	this? On his official website, do you subscribe to the dude's blog? Actually, I saw it on
9324540	9328900	his Twitter on the official Techno Kitten Adventure Twitter feed. I think it's I can
9328900	9333420	has kitten or something like that. All right. And it's linking to an article on no gamer
9333420	9338420	left behind. All right. Well, here you go. If you have never played Techno Kitten Adventure
9338420	9356740	before, then you're missing out on this. I just blew some. I just couldn't believe that
9356740	9360460	guy made this game because that guy, when we interviewed him, sound like he'd been playing
9360460	9369340	a lot of Grateful Dead, Guitar Hero, if you know what I mean. Yeah. I mean, have you seen
9369340	9377820	the news, a new screenshot? I haven't. I love you. No, I haven't seen a new screenshot.
9377820	9386380	Where are they? I retweeted it on my Twitter feed. Twitter, twitter.com slash blue swim.
9386380	9393060	B plug. Cheap plug. Yes, I know. I'm a graduate of the Mick Foley School of Cheap Pops. Yes.
9393060	9396460	I don't see it yet. It hasn't popped up yet. Hold on. I'm waiting. Wait, just now you did
9396460	9402820	or? Oh, no, I see. I see. Oh, there it is. A few days ago. Okay. New screenshots. Oh,
9402820	9409300	now there's pink dolphins and more rainbows. Quadruple rainbow. What does it mean? Also,
9409300	9415940	there is a little blimp in the screen and I thought at first it said fart on the blimp,
9415940	9420260	but it actually says party. It's just a little marquee that's scrolling and it looked like
9420260	9423860	it said fart, but I'd laugh if there was a blimp that randomly flew across the screen
9423860	9429020	and said fart. It looks like the visuals are better. Oh, sure. I'm sure they've had chance
9429020	9433740	to touch it up, but it's not as cool as, uh, what was it? That one kitten that flies around
9433740	9441620	the rainbow and has annoying song with it. Same game. No, I don't know. Oh, the unicorn
9441620	9448660	adventure. No, no, the maim. Oh, I don't remember. All right. The one that's like, yeah, I forget
9448660	9455100	the song. It was one that was super important. The portal lines. All right. Well, blue swim,
9455100	9459820	do you have any other things you want to share with us tonight? Um, I think that's about
9459820	9465460	it. All right. Well, um, enjoy techno kitten adventure and uh, you know, don't do drugs.
9465460	9470260	Hey, I don't. I haven't done them for 24 years and I'm looking to keep that streak going.
9470260	9475460	All right. Good. All right. Take care. You too. Good night guys. I know he probably doesn't
9475460	9479700	do drugs, but I'm just, I'm just saying. All right. Uh, Oh, they're saying that they should
9479700	9484780	make a, uh, a game out of Nyan cat. Is that the, what you were thinking of earlier? Nyan
9484780	9488980	cat. All right. Nyan cat. That's what it is. All right. One eight seven seven game. O L
9488980	9494940	R or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio. And if you're like one of the two people
9494940	9501300	on the internet who hasn't seen it, here it is just for Loki. I have seen it, but that's
9501300	9507020	what I'm saying. That's much cooler than techno kitten adventure. Like, can you imagine a
9507020	9512020	game based off that one April fools? I just want to do the whole show with this in the
9512020	9524380	background. It's pretty awesome. Admit it. You're singing along now. Hey, Thomas Howard,
9524380	9532300	singing over that. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on a orange launch radio. Who's
9532300	9537940	this? Yeah, it's like, Hey, what's on your mind, buddy? Uh, nothing much. Just like trying
9537940	9544020	to like get all my chilling and relaxing before work tomorrow. But more importantly, trying
9544020	9550980	to see if I could compare two, two parallels for you, you know, in terms of what I've heard
9550980	9555620	last night and what I'm seeing, you know, what I've seen this weekend, case in point,
9555620	9562380	Konami basically stagnating on DDR and Activision whoring out Call of Duty and Guitar Hero and
9562380	9568340	basically any franchises that touch it. And to that point, it's like, the way I see it
9568340	9573380	is that the only way Konami could really dig that franchise out of the, out of the grave
9573380	9578860	more or less is that they have, they have to move beyond the four arrows. I know some
9578860	9582660	people are just going to be, they're basically going to eat me alive for what I'm saying.
9582660	9587380	But if you look at the way harmonics managed to take advantage of connect and run with
9587380	9593900	it, it's pretty apparent that physical, physical controls are no longer, they no longer apply.
9593900	9603140	As long as the camera is able to do all the work for you. You agree? Um, so you think
9603140	9607540	that the cameras should just do everything and that there's no need for a dance pad anymore?
9607540	9612180	Well, it's not even that. It's just like the, they need more modern controls. Like if you're
9612180	9619100	still, if you're still relying on, you know, on a panel with four sensors to actually register
9619100	9624860	input, then, then you're still stuck in the past when people have arms and legs that you
9624860	9631140	should be able to capture either through like through the camera or some other panel that
9631140	9634380	doesn't have any like intricate parts like that.
9634380	9638700	Even DDR kind of tried the whole like arms and legs thing before though. I feel like
9638700	9643340	every DDR game does something with the gimmicks. Yeah. Once again, they just, it's not even
9643340	9648860	gimmicky in the sense you have to like, if you look at how dance central is only like,
9648860	9653140	you're only, you're standing up while dancing, essentially. If you were able to create a
9653140	9657620	version, you know, a feature dancing game that not only did that, we're allowed to do
9657620	9661940	break dancing moves, which is like really, really wishful thinking I'm pulling out right
9661940	9666900	now. That would be a killer feature. Now, why don't we just give them the choice, you
9666900	9671100	know, to choose between doing it. And now I understand that Konami's kind of, eh, when
9671100	9676060	it comes to emulating stuff. They're basically taking the same thing, applying the same methods
9676060	9683660	and expecting different results. That my friends is insanity. I mean, something has to give
9683660	9689300	because at this point, I mean, I somewhat care about DDR, but it's not important anymore.
9689300	9694700	I've moved on in that sense ever since CF closed back home in New York city is just
9694700	9702220	like, it doesn't matter. I wouldn't give two shits right now, but I mean, other people
9702220	9708160	may, you know, you know, may feel different. I mean, but that's them. And that's because
9708160	9712500	they're still holding on. I mean, I haven't even been on a dance. Last time I was on a
9712500	9717740	dance pad was a few weeks ago. And before that month, it's like, I'm going without like
9717740	9722180	DDR for, you know, at this point, it's just, you know, I couldn't, I'm fine. It won't kill
9722180	9727780	me if I don't, if I don't play. Not that a day, but the bottom line is this, you know,
9727780	9733620	for one company to try to, try to revive a franchise by constantly doing the same thing
9733620	9738300	that got them there in the first place without innovating, it's, it's not going to look good
9738300	9743460	for them. And I'm going on Activision's point where this is what happened to Guitar Hero.
9743460	9745180	And this is what will happen to Call of Duty.
9745180	9750620	Well, let me, let me ask you a question. Isn't it okay to let the franchise die? I mean,
9750620	9755740	like for example, combat on the Atari 2600, you know what? It's just, it's just done it.
9755740	9759180	There's never going to be another one. Let's just let it be. I mean, is it okay to just
9759180	9763900	say, you know what? It's, we don't need DDR anymore. We have stuff like Dance Central
9763900	9768820	or we have other dance games. I mean, can't we just let bygones be bygones, so to speak?
9768820	9773940	I guess what they need to, what Konami needs to do is like, maybe, I don't know if they
9773940	9780100	should retire the, the, the series, but try to move on, you know, try to move it on with
9780100	9785980	a more spiritual, more of a spiritual, spiritual successor. Something that really isn't DDR,
9785980	9788420	but it's the next evolution in that, in that whole genre.
9788420	9790940	Well, isn't that supposed to be what Dance Masters is?
9790940	9796500	Yeah, but that one was a rush job. It was, they didn't really think it out because it
9796500	9801380	was just a simple grab for, for money by the time, you know, as a, as a Kinect launch title.
9801380	9804660	I mean, now that it's already, now the cat's already out of the bag, you really,
9804660	9806540	I know the cat is out of the bag.
9806540	9811820	I mean, Konami really needs to take a good look at what, you know, what they can do to
9811820	9816860	differentiate themselves from the competition and still be, still be profitable. I know
9816860	9822340	it's a, it's a Herculean task, but I mean, it worked for harmonics in trying to, you
9822340	9827540	know, to win over Guitar Hero folks in a rock band. Cause that one, you know, the innovation
9827540	9831980	right there was just, you know, add more, add more peripherals. And from there, add
9831980	9836940	more DLC and so forth and try to bring more realism into that experience, trying to bring
9836940	9841020	an experience into the, into their living rooms or in an arcade.
9841020	9843420	We got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but do you have any final thoughts
9843420	9844420	for us tonight?
9844420	9851340	Um, let's see, uh, PSN is probably, the way I see PSN is like, they, they, they're going
9851340	9856180	to need more than a prayer. They're kind of done if they're completely compromised.
9856180	9859980	All right, Zaku. Well, thank you so much for the call. Have a good one.
9859980	9860980	Have a good one.
9860980	9861980	Meow.
9861980	9866060	All right. 1-877-GAMO-LR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. If you want to
9866060	9870860	give us a call, though, I don't know if we'll get any calls after that. All right. Uh, let's
9870860	9874980	see. Kaijuto in our chat room says they need to put guns in DDR. That will save it.
9874980	9882300	I could figure out a way to do that, but, uh,
9882300	9886580	Two step in, one steps out.
9886580	9895180	No, I, I, I agree with, um, you know, the fact that they just didn't really implement
9895180	9900580	a lot of things well. And I think Dance Masters could be good. It's just they didn't do it
9900580	9905900	right the first time around. There's a lot of things that they, glaring omissions that
9905900	9910660	she, you know, Hey, you know, it'd be fun. It's a way to learn those routines instead
9910660	9916020	of having to play them over and over and over again and fail. That might be cool. You know,
9916020	9921920	with the Torioma or some sort of indicator what's coming up next. Uh, you know, so dark
9921920	9928180	to is suggesting just putting the end cat in DDR. All right. There. DDR kittens, dance
9928180	9931260	kitten adventure. That's what's going to save the game. All right. We're gonna close up
9931260	9934620	the Skype lines and someone else is calling. It's after nine anyway. So let's go around
9934620	9937740	and get everybody's a final thought. Actually, I didn't get any last minute stories. We were
9937740	9942220	doing call after call there. So do you a dark soccer won't start us then? Well, apparently
9942220	9948900	Stephen Colbert is part of the noble team. Well, not actually. Um, he, this actually
9948900	9955900	comes from a joke that he made about, um, master chief being one of the, uh, original
9955900	9963620	members of seal team six. And so, uh, bungee pulled off the image and put him on, uh, an
9963620	9971860	armored body. It's, it's just a mock up. It's not real, but it was pretty funny. And then,
9971860	9975500	um, there was a quote going around saying that valve was getting rid of single player
9975500	9980700	games, but really they're invoking single player plus to where you have social interactivity
9980700	9990220	in your first in your one player games. All right. Uh, Loki, you have any final stories
9990220	9995260	for earth last minute stories for us tonight? Yeah, real quick. Um, we, I think I mentioned
9995260	9999780	this back a while ago. There was an indie game that was coming out on the Xbox in the
9999780	10006540	marketplace, uh, that kind of combined almost think of it like a DDR meets a puzzle quest,
10006540	10010940	but, uh, it's out now. Actually it's called sequence and definitely check it out. There's
10010940	10015740	basically three different screens that are available that you switch between. Kind of
10015740	10023780	think of like the rock band, PSP and DS version. Um, and then you, you know, tap up the sequences.
10023780	10029180	Um, and one of them, I think it's like for health regeneration, one's a defense and others
10029180	10034140	like a magic or attack or something like that. So, um, check it out. It's available right
10034140	10041300	now for $3 or 240 Microsoft points and the title sequence. Um, and then of course it
10041300	10045780	was announced this week that, uh, Nintendo is dropping the price of the we bundle to
10045780	10050100	one 50 even though it was like rumored. Um, so all we systems are now going to be one
10050100	10056140	50. They're also putting out a new we bundle that's going to be with Mario cart. Um, and
10056140	10060140	of course the emotion, uh, are we remote plus and that kind of stuff that available in black
10060140	10065020	and white. And they're also going to be selling we sports separate because obviously this
10065020	10069300	does not come with we sports. If you ask me, it's kind of a rip off because instead of
10069300	10075620	getting two games for one 50 you're getting one game for one 50. Um, and you know, you
10075620	10078800	kind of think, let me guess they dropped the price of we sports resort, but it's still
10078800	10084940	kind of a rip off I think. Um, and then of course they also announced that they're going
10084940	10091140	to be doing a line of, um, titles are going to be cheaper. Nintendo selects. Um, and the
10091140	10096420	first lineup for the U S would be, and of course in the city folk, Mario's super sluggers,
10096420	10101700	we sports and Zelda twilight princess. Where the fuck is the love for excite truck is what
10101700	10107660	I got to ask, but you know, whatever. And then finally also, uh, in the UK they're going
10107660	10110880	to be doing the Nintendo selects as well. Uh, they're going to have a little bit different
10110880	10116420	of a lineup, uh, starting with a we sports course. So why are you aware smooth moves,
10116420	10125420	which is a pretty awesome game, animal crossing, um, and Mario's strikers, uh, charge their
10125420	10132700	football game over there. And then, uh, I mentioned this on my Twitter feed earlier.
10132700	10137980	Nintendo has conceded that they have struggled with online on the we and I promise to improve
10137980	10142740	it with the next system. Oh, Nintendo. Oh, and you didn't have to. Yes. So it's honestly
10142740	10147420	speaking the we's future could have been different if Nintendo had made better partnerships with
10147420	10151340	outside companies in the field of network services at early stages of penetration of
10151340	10159420	the we penetration. Uh, in other words, Nintendo might have been a little obsessed with, uh,
10159420	10168380	the policy. Uh, yeah. So, all right. Well, if that does it for last minute stories, yes.
10168380	10171180	Then we're going to go around and get her base of final thoughts. First off, we want
10171180	10174700	to thank you guys for downloading and listening to orange lounge radio this week or tuning
10174700	10178740	in live, whatever the case may be. Uh, all we ask, we don't really play commercials except
10178740	10183380	for, you know, other podcasts, but, uh, we don't, uh, make any money off this show. All
10183380	10187680	we ask, tell two friends about the show, help us spread the word. Uh, even if you don't
10187680	10190760	know who to tell, you could leave us a nice review on iTunes. We've had some wonderful
10190760	10194140	five star reviews in the past couple of weeks. Really appreciate those. They really do go
10194140	10199020	a long way in helping us get visibility and continue to spread the word of Nyan cat being
10199020	10202940	played over phone calls. Uh, dark soccer. Do you have a final thought for our listeners
10202940	10210700	tonight? I really freaking want a taco. My final thought is, uh, I'm going to just go
10210700	10215740	get a taco. That's what I'm going to do. Don't make stinky face at me. Uh, Loki, your final
10215740	10224380	thought. I joined Mensa and all I got was this membership card and discounts off Geico.
10224380	10228820	It's official. You're smart. All right. That's it everybody. Have a wonderful week. We are
10228820	10233060	done for the night, but, uh, yeah. Uh, have a good one. We'll see you next week. We'll
10233060	10238940	be back to do it all again. So, uh, join us. Bye. You've been listening to orange lounge
10238940	10246140	radio. Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show. Visit
10246140	10254740	www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time. The views and opinions expressed on
10254740	10259820	orange lounge radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of orange lounge

10283060	10288300	So something special after the credits tonight here on OLR, uh, because mostly I'm an idiot
10288300	10293060	and I forgot to play this earlier in the show, but, uh, of course today is mother's day in
10293060	10297100	the United States and I will, and I believe other countries too, but I want to say a very
10297100	10302340	happy mother's day to all the mommies out there. Uh, all the motherly figures or whoever
10302340	10306740	is considered a mother in your life. I want to say a happy mother's day to everybody.
10306740	10310220	And you know, once in a while here on the show, we like to do like, you know, like a
10310220	10313860	phone call to mom. So I think a couple of years ago we called dark soccer's mom. We
10313860	10316500	called my mom before. I think even Loki's mom's probably been on the show at some point
10316500	10321420	or another. So, um, tonight, uh, I wanted to give you guys an extra surprise and this
10321420	10325380	is a very special thing for you guys that have listened through the whole thing. You've
10325380	10328960	either stayed up very late with us live or you've listened through the entire podcast.
10328960	10335560	But I promised you at some point I would have my mother review mortal combat. And so I have
10335560	10340640	a clip of my mother watching me play mortal combat. And she actually said, if you put
10340640	10345040	the video on the internet, I will kill you. However, she didn't say I couldn't play the
10345040	10349820	audio for you guys on my radio show. Tell your mom, who's going to tell my mom. So here
10349820	10355000	it is. Who's going to tell Rob's mom? This is the first time my mother watched us play
10355000	10360260	mortal combat. And just for the record, it was Molina versus striker. Here we go. Okay,
10360260	10364540	so I'm here with my mommy. You know, your, your hair looks fine. Say hi to the internet,
10364540	10372900	you're fine. You look fine. Okay. How are you doing? I'm fine. So we wanted to show
10372900	10376580	you a video game. It's a new video game that came out. It's called mortal combat. Have
10376580	10382460	you ever heard of it? Yeah. And what do you know of it? It's violent. And what do you
10382460	10389140	think about violence in games? I think it's pathetic. Why? Because it teaches little kids
10389140	10394220	to be violent, but can't you like supervise little kids? Didn't I play mortal combat when
10394220	10402460	I was a kid? No, I supervise kids, but a lot of parents don't. Okay. Well, we just wanted
10402460	10405900	to show you the new game and see what you think of the graphics and the technology.
10405900	10416940	Look at her. She's not even dressed. That's disgusting. I need a comment about that. Yeah.
10416940	10425980	Her nipples aren't in the right place. If they were, you could see them. Look at her.
10425980	10436060	She's an Amazon. Oh my God. They threw her around. So do you think stage fatality Rob
10436060	10446820	or the uh, I would do her normal one. Is that blood all over the stage? Yep. Oh my God.
10446820	10457900	She hit him right in the cahoots. What's your name? Melina. What is that she has on? There's
10457900	10469060	some places missing. This, this is a game that's rated PG 17, right? It's rated M for
10469060	10492300	amateur. Oh, it should be rated. She's giving them kisses. Kids have no threshold for violence.
10492300	10498780	That's why, because they're conditioned that way. You got it. So after you beat the guy,
10498780	10524620	you get to, here's the best part. She's going to take his head off. Oh my God. I knew it.
10524620	10535580	Look at her outfit. What'd you think? It's disgusting. There you go. I love your mom.
10535580	10539860	My mother reacting to the regular outfit or was it like the tape outfit? It was no, it
10539860	10543540	wasn't the tape outfit. It was a regular little hoochie mama outfit there. Cause the tape
10543540	10548340	outfits is worse. We hadn't unlocked that yet. We haven't gotten to the top of the tower.
10548340	10553000	I think Alan's on like challenge 120 or something. So there you go. My mother's seeing Mortal
10553000	10557340	Kombat for the very first time. Her nipples are in the wrong place. You know how my mom's
10557340	10561740	like way more concerned with the outfit than anything else. Love it. Love you mom. Don't
10561740	10564620	be mad that I put this on my show. You said I couldn't do the video. I didn't put the
10564620	10567940	video up. I'm not going to put it on YouTube. There it is. I just like that you could totally
10567940	10574460	hear the in the background. I was like, Oh, I know what's going on. It's head eating time.
10574460	10578900	All right. That really does bring it into the podcast tonight. Uh, for those of you
10578900	10581780	guys listening live, stay tuned. But for those of you guys on the podcast, this really is
10581780	10583220	the end. Have a wonderful night, everybody.
