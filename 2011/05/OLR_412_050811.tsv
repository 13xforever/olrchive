10097	12258	Sky, and Loki.
13978	26383	Tonight, May 8, 2011, Sony is on day 18 of PlayStation Network outage, has a dev kit for the next Xbox been spotted at a game developer, and Club Nintendo makes a controversial change to their privacy policy.
31297	35900	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35940	38181	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38641	39502	My name is Rob Roberts.
39522	42884	I'll be joining you over the next few hours here live with my co-host with me.
43484	47427	Of course the one, the only, the awesome DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47487	47807	Heck yeah.
47847	48848	How are you doing?
49348	49708	Awesome.
49888	51990	And also very humble might I add.
52030	52530	Heck yeah.
54352	54753	TechMasterLoki
66707	66807	Hi.
90814	114528	Ooh, Shiny, another game, I'll go play that I mean, there's so much out there to play There's so many games that come out every week I mean, not just, like, you know, in retail But you have the download games that are available Well, you know, were available on one console And, you know, so on and so forth There's just so much to play PC and so on I don't always get around to everything But, yeah, I actually played Portal 2 to completion and beat it Yay!
115008	117550	So, I feel accomplished I don't know why
118550	119351	Also, it's short.
119391	119851	That helps.
120311	120531	Rob.
120891	121111	What?
121412	123453	The potato is not a lie.
124633	127295	I don't want to spoil it because I know there's some people that still haven't played it.
127615	132457	I have to say, the ending, well, I lulled at the very, very, very, very end.
132497	135319	But for the rest of it, I was kind of like, oh, that's it?
136199	137360	I thought there was going to be a little bit more.
137700	142263	But I think something in my head, I made up a plot point in my head that didn't come to fruition.
142603	144464	And I think that's why I was a little bit like, oh...
145004	145304	I see.
146185	148167	I was a little let down because I wasn't right on that point.
148207	154031	I was right on everything else, but then when the other thing didn't come true, I was like, oh, I guess I can't tell the future after all.
154672	165300	Alright, anyhow, join us in our chatroom, chat.orangelandreda.com as we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
165620	165961	DarkSakura.com
180539	181200	Portal 2, Bejeweled
196875	215309	for real because it's supposed to actually drop enough blocks that eventually it just the game will crash on you well not crash but the game will just end because you don't have any more moves and that never happened so finally I just said forget it and went to bed and then I played Peggle yay Peggle
215737	216758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
236852	237593	I've played that too.
237613	240557	There hasn't been a PopCap WoW marriage in a while.
240597	243320	Well, I mean, I guess there was the Peace Bloom vs. Ghouls or whatever.
243340	244121	Yeah, where was that?
244141	244902	Because I haven't done that.
245022	247766	Oh, it's in Hillsbrad Mountains.
247786	248807	Do you know where Terran Mill is?
249188	250489	It's not far from there.
251130	253353	I've been going around actually looking for Easter eggs.
254656	255717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
283231	287717	Well, except I don't have the, um, the, uh... Yes?
291607	292668	All the Cataclysm one yet.
293408	296250	Because I skipped the Underwater Kingdom.
296731	302574	And I've just recently gone back so I could get my Exalted with them.
302615	305496	And now I'm just like, people take me on Heroics, please.
305657	308819	Well, I don't want to turn this too much into the WoW show because I already have a spinoff show for WoW.
308839	313442	But I do want to quickly say, you know, just even today, you do find new stuff in the game once in a while.
313462	315123	And that's kind of the fun thing about a virtual world.
315403	318966	No matter what MMO you play, I think this can really be expanded to any MMO out there.
319066	320807	Rift, Star Trek, whatever it is you play.
321287	323709	It's always fun to sometimes just go explore and find new things.
323870	329635	Even just today, Salacious Pop was like, Hey, Rob, I see this house here I've never seen before.
330275	331677	It's not really on the map or anything.
331697	333018	It's just up here in the hill.
333538	334960	And this guy wants junk boxes.
335000	336001	I can't figure out what he's for.
336321	337882	So sometimes you find random stuff.
337902	339544	Did you find the place where the animals have weapons?
340330	341171	No, where's that?
341431	346974	I'll find it during the course of the show, but there's a place that's like the only way you can get there is if you have a flying mount.
347535	350757	And I think at the part that you're normally there, you don't have one.
350897	352798	Actually, if I'm right, I think it's the Tauren starting area.
353599	358002	But it's one place up at the top of the map that you can only get there with a flying mount.
358082	361324	And then randomly, different animals are wearing helmets.
362045	364966	Okay, the prairie dogs wear helmets and carry knives.
365607	367568	The rabbits carry battle axes.
368129	369890	And the rats wear skull helmets.
370631	372813	and carry two double-barreled shotguns.
372954	373815	That's kind of awesome.
373855	376839	And they get bigger and then all of a sudden they'll shrink down and go to normal size.
377320	381105	And I'm also going to try to wake up early in the morning and do the Goldshire Children thing.
383292	387155	The only Easter egg area I've really explored was the one... It's right outside Stormwind.
387195	387836	It's up in the hills.
388136	389317	And there's all these sheep.
389598	392080	Just tons and tons of sheep that you can kill for the critter achievement.
392521	396504	And if you kill them all, though, the guy comes out of his house and he goes, What's wrong with you?
396545	397806	That's just wrong.
398747	400889	He starts yelling at you about what a bastard you are.
401109	403131	There's another place... But you kill sheep.
403451	404733	There's another place that has...
406674	407675	And this will be the end of it.
407815	409076	This one was one I thought was really nice.
409837	415060	There's a monument and a dwarf in red named Roush kneeling in front of it.
416021	420404	And it reads, rest in peace, Anthony T. Stark.
421124	422726	People were calling that the Iron Man thing, but it's not.
422766	424627	It was actually for a guy who was a friend of the developers.
425247	427349	And Roush was his character, the dwarf.
428069	430071	So they made him an NPC.
430411	430871	Very cool.
431071	432212	I thought that was a nice gesture.
432412	433133	And a smiley face.
433453	435974	I'll say this about another MMO, Final Fantasy XI.
436014	437815	You know, I played that for many years before I played WoW.
438155	441977	One of the things I used to really like about that is that I really like the ambience of that game.
442017	444278	You know, the graphics are more first person.
444318	446259	I mean, they can be third person depending on how you play.
446659	451321	But I just really liked exploring areas in that game because there were some really beautiful areas and great music.
451901	479677	and because of the way the game was designed you wouldn't always like see every area for a long time so as you were progressing which could sometimes take months and months you would find these new areas and hear new music and it was just really cool I mean it was a frustrating ass grind that's why I was so disappointed that 14 was such garbage I mean sorry to say what's going to happen to 14 we haven't heard of what's going on there in a while I don't know if they're going to try to reboot or what I don't know
480758	482160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
496218	498560	And not as pain in the ass as a grind.
498580	501761	Well, they did change a lot of stuff in XI since you and I left.
501801	503963	Like, the level syncing thing is huge.
504423	507685	But there's only so much you can cram into an old engine.
507745	509546	And that's where Warcraft's starting to have that problem.
509606	510847	I want much different outfits.
511467	512008	Seriously.
512348	515510	There's so many different armors that change your look in World of Warcraft.
516110	519032	But really, in Final Fantasy XI, it's just like...
520698	521919	Oh, I'm wearing the bondage gear.
522619	524060	Oh, now I'm wearing white mage robes.
524401	526802	They're just very few new things.
527743	530445	And you can tell what anybody is by looking at them.
530765	534588	And the other problem XIV had was that it tried to change it up too much.
534668	540311	Like, instead of being just a white mage and a black mage, now you could be a gladiator or a theramaterge.
540452	541072	Like, what?
541412	544134	That's not why I play Final Fantasy, to be a fucking theramaterge.
544174	547877	And seriously, what is the point of having the same races but changing the names?
548477	549378	That was retarded.
549478	549718	Silly.
549958	552138	Anyway, okay, enough MMO ranting.
552379	553079	Let's talk about other games.
553099	562921	By the way, I must say that my wife's character, well, before she had the hairdo change, but she looked like Mel's Taro Taro at one point.
563141	565121	Actually, no, she does look like Mel's Taro Taro now.
565241	566902	Wait, wait, your wife had a Final Fantasy XI character?
567142	569282	No, I'm saying she's playing Animal Crossing.
569342	574823	Her character in Animal Crossing looks like Mel's little Taro Taro because Mel looked like a little grandma.
574963	575644	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
575804	576604	That always cracked me up.
577504	577724	Awesome.
580555	581335	There are those days.
581495	587498	I'll see those sales on Steam where it's like, Final Fantasy XI is only $20 for the uber mega OMG I can't believe it version.
587859	589399	And I'm like, I kind of want to go back.
590160	591380	I kind of want to go back.
591400	591840	Resist, resist.
591961	593021	I will, I will.
593501	594022	All right, anyhow.
594762	595903	Loki, how was your gaming week?
595943	596583	What have you been playing?
597683	598584	Only really three things.
599845	605087	Wait, more importantly, the chat room wants to know for the betting pool tonight, what food did you bring to the show?
606348	607789	I brought a Carl's Jr.
607889	610470	Western burger.
610770	611230	There you go.
611270	614112	I don't think anyone guessed Carl's Jr., so we got a lot of losers in chat tonight.
614608	616149	I had a Red Bull last night because I was up until 4.30.
616409	617169	It's still the color of pee.
642620	643681	It is, but it keeps you awake.
644261	644662	I don't care.
644962	646062	It makes my brain function.
647163	647403	All right.
648004	648244	Video games.
648264	649225	What have you been playing this week?
650385	652567	Breakman in our chat asks, what's a Carl's Jr.?
652847	654588	If you're on the East Coast, I think they call it Hardee's.
654749	655149	Yeah.
655409	655729	Same thing.
657430	663314	Anyways, I played Portal 2, a lot of Portal 2, and progressing nicely through it.
663775	666817	See, I started off on the 360, but I decided, you know...
669023	671064	Here's how it went down.
672405	676228	It's not technically piracy, because I do own a copy of it.
676648	678749	Just I'm not playing the copy that I bought.
680270	682552	So I have the 360 copy.
682872	687935	I have the PS3 copy that I got for free through my work, which has the PC Steam copy.
688455	692278	But as you know, PlayStation Network is down, so I can't download my Steam copy.
692718	695560	So I pirated the PC copy, and I'm playing that.
696440	698142	So technically I own it on PC.
699083	700445	I just am not playing that copy.
701506	702026	But who cares?
702347	706531	I'm enjoying it just fine on my laptop because it runs very, very great.
706712	708313	I can max out everything.
709935	710055	And...
711980	713242	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
730192	737516	Okay, so then beyond Portal, I've been playing Unpleasant Horse, which is awesome.
738196	742318	Especially throwing little flying horses into meat grinders.
745340	747061	And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto.
748301	748701	That's it.
749442	751743	Of course, it just wouldn't be a Loki week without Grand Theft Auto.
752008	753129	We always play Grand Theft Auto.
772889	774811	So just reiterating the same stuff.
774872	776834	I beat Portal 2, as I said at the top of the show.
776874	777795	That was a big accomplishment.
777855	779016	Still need to work on co-op.
779316	780377	Miklatov, I know you're listening.
780397	781238	You need to work on co-op.
782519	783621	I'll join you if... Will you?
784001	785382	Well, I've got my PS3 copy.
785783	787525	I'll join you once the network comes back up.
787545	788305	Yeah, screw Miklatov.
788326	788686	We'll do it.
788726	788946	All right.
788966	789166	All right.
789367	789727	Sounds good.
791028	793890	Anyhow, let's see what else I've been playing.
794010	795131	Or can't you do split screen?
795791	799593	You can, but one of our controllers, PS3 controllers, is still in a box.
800754	805657	Oh, well how can we get it out of this impenetrable cardboard box?
806537	811961	Oh, if only there were a way to break into the fortress that is the cardboard box.
811981	813522	Look, you dick, it's in a box.
813562	814943	We don't know which box it's in.
815344	816685	It's like playing a game show.
816825	819387	Well, there's a very simple solution to that.
819447	823450	One box has the PSN controller, the other box has the lube.
823770	825031	We don't know which box it's in.
825051	828333	You rip open all the boxes, dump them on the floor, and then you'll find it.
828814	829234	That's it.
830953	831213	Dirty Laundry
852751	853451	Of course!
853872	855813	You buy them nice things and they don't appreciate it.
855833	856373	That's a cat for you.
856393	862356	I was telling Rob earlier, I got Shermie this really nice series of cat beds that she'd just ignore.
862717	865758	And then I pick up this one for $13 on sale and it's her favorite thing.
866759	867319	Just give it time.
867379	868960	It is super comfy though.
869280	870261	I know these things take time.
870281	873663	It's like my cat, I got her a nice new bed and she was scared of it because it looked like a cat.
873983	874964	Shermie, do you like your bed?
877485	879666	Yeah, Dan says in the other room she slept on a box.
879966	880827	She slept on a box?
880847	880927	Yeah.
881260	881540	Dirty Laundry
897280	899162	No, you know what they use when there's no dirty laundry?
899443	900404	They use my chair.
901024	901124	Oh.
901665	902105	That's what they do.
902145	903246	Anyway, I don't want to talk about cats.
903266	903907	I want to talk about games.
904187	905429	But I also want to talk about this comment.
905449	906670	Miglatov just IM me.
906690	909092	He's like, well, just tell me when you want to play Portal 2 and I'll play.
909513	916079	But he also said, apparently I missed the remark about I'd go back for $5 to Final Fantasy XI if you would too.
916419	918081	Kind of like a suicide pact.
919422	920183	Oh, sad.
921485	922726	I like that reference.
922766	924028	Oh man, if I had the time.
924289	924990	I know, right?
925390	926812	Just for good old times.
927453	929056	Let's just go not have a life again.
929216	936066	And that's like so, I don't know, nonconformist because everybody's like, MMO?
936226	936466	Wow.
937808	939709	Fuck that, we're going to Final Fantasy XI.
940050	940350	What?
941290	944152	It's like, I don't know.
944212	945153	I miss Grandma Taru.
945253	946794	Okay, look, other games I've played.
946874	949495	Speaking of Final Fantasy, I'm still playing Final Fantasy IV on the PSP.
949796	951717	I play it for like 30 minutes before I go to bed every night.
951757	954278	It's a nice little way to kind of, you know, rest before bed.
954959	958001	Of course, I love that game on the Super Nintendo, so of course I love the PSN port.
958441	962283	And I'm doing kind of the Jamie thing where I have to play it chronologically.
962803	964885	Like, you know, where you guys are doing the Final Fantasy marathon.
964905	965065	Yeah.
965425	985734	well I'm starting with 4 and then I'll play the interlude and then I'll play After Years finally which I played like a little bit of on the Wii but I want to play it on the PSP because I love the new graphics and it really is just a great looking game and I hope people didn't overlook it because it came out the same week as Portal because that would just be I really want 5 and 6 to come out hey find us a Portal
986674	987235	Exactly.
987635	988015	Shiny.
989356	992158	Otherwise... Can't play Portal on a PSP.
992559	994240	That's most... Yeah, that's true.
994360	995701	You can't play Portal in bed.
996362	1000185	Well, actually, you probably could play Portal on a PSP if they hacked the...
1001505	1001725	StarCraft 2
1019472	1020093	StarCraft 2 Red Alert
1040230	1041991	StarCraft series is really like the old Warcraft games
1060526	1065910	Just, you know, I'm sure StarCraft fans get driven bonkers when I say that, but really at its core, it's kind of what it is.
1066270	1070733	You know, collection, build buildings, build units, attack, kill, destroy, and so forth.
1071394	1073395	So, that was my gaming week.
1073735	1077518	Join us in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat with us with tonight's news.
1077558	1080880	We'll be reading random comments in chat throughout the show.
1083303	1087588	SilverSonic in our chatroom, for example, says, didn't you mean on Twitter that you played Minecraft?
1088549	1089550	I played that last week.
1089650	1091272	My review on Minecraft was last week.
1091392	1092273	And let me put it this way.
1092713	1093955	I didn't play it again this week.
1095091	1095892	This is Rob's Review.
1113326	1118229	If Minecraft weren't, say, little pixelated blocks and they were Legos, would that make the game more appealing?
1118309	1120470	I love the little Lego builder.
1120490	1121751	I love that app.
1121831	1123172	You can download this thing on the PC.
1123212	1124272	I think I mentioned this last week.
1124553	1136580	You can make your own little Lego things and then actually have them ship to you instructions on how to build it, because the computer program remembers how you built it, and I guess a logic thing, and they will send you all the appropriate bricks.
1136920	1140582	So it's like this thing for people to do 8-bit sprites in Legos.
1140802	1143203	That sounds more interesting to me than Minecraft.
1143323	1148424	It's way more interesting than Minecraft, actually, because I get something tangible out of it.
1149205	1156327	Not to knock people that spend a lot of time making stuff in Minecraft, but you know what would be awesome with Minecraft?
1156767	1163089	If you combine Minecraft, the world, and being able to build everything like that with ZZT, where you can actually make your own games.
1163109	1164929	Fuck yes, I would be all over that shit.
1164989	1166970	Oh my god, now we're talking.
1167410	1172133	I'm just shocked that there's Minecraft podcasts and all this stuff.
1172293	1177836	I've watched videos of people like, this is my basement.
1178477	1181539	I want to support all indie podcasters, so look, I'm not knocking it.
1181699	1182939	If you're into that, that's awesome.
1183080	1188103	I feel so not cool for not understanding Minecraft.
1188883	1189624	Thanks for watching!
1209757	1233511	and you know if I ever came across you know an extra 12 hours in a day where I could just sit there and build in Minecraft then yeah that might be a fun game for me but I just don't have the time although if you want to like say port that over Nintendo and put some Animal Crossing characters in that and sell it to my wife then I might get to play it a little bit more
1234111	1237092	Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelogicator.com for some comments.
1237112	1240774	Kaijudo in our chatroom says, To understand Minecraft, you have to get the pay version.
1240874	1241655	It has a lot more.
1241715	1243015	The free version is a joke.
1243516	1247878	But yeah, but if the free version isn't that great, then it doesn't really make me want to get the pay version.
1247998	1248898	But I get it.
1249718	1250059	Let's see.
1250819	1260323	I apologize if I mispronounce this, but Entitilus says, What's the name of that 8-bit Zelda clone on the PS3 that came out a while back?
1260363	1260764	That was 3D.com.
1261664	1261964	Heroes.
1262164	1262364	Yeah.
1262945	1263785	That game was cool.
1263865	1264806	I want another one of those.
1266326	1267307	I'm surprised I never got sued.
1268007	1268308	Let's see.
1268508	1270409	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, It's okay, Rob.
1270609	1271689	I don't understand WoW.
1272069	1274030	Yet some people do WoW podcasts, too.
1274291	1275251	No, I'm with you, BlackWolf.
1275311	1277032	I don't understand WoW either, but you know what?
1277052	1278533	It's because you guys just aren't cool.
1279553	1280634	I'm sorry to say it.
1280734	1282795	Like, you know, I'm not... I still like you guys.
1282815	1283776	You're just not cool.
1283936	1288278	I just... I never understand... You know, just from looking at the outside in my...
1288658	1289499	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1309477	1310938	Here's the thing about WoW.
1310978	1312498	I'll just sum it up as fast as I can.
1312578	1315879	It's really about the people that I play with that keep me doing it.
1316179	1320180	Because if the people weren't there that I was playing with, I would have canceled my account a long time ago.
1320440	1322021	I got really close this past week.
1322101	1322561	Oh my god.
1322861	1325742	I got so frustrated at something in the game, I really wanted to cancel my account.
1325802	1331604	But I kind of have that podcast now, and there's also the community of people I really like that also play it.
1332685	1340759	and that's probably why the Minecraft people do their thing because they've got a community too but I'm just not able to be in that community because I'm a terrible terrible terrible artist
1342745	1343326	That's what it is.
1343486	1350391	Well, I'm just saying, you know, the best little taro house in Vanadil is not that bad of a name either.
1350912	1351172	All right.
1352813	1353354	Let's move on.
1353414	1354595	We need to get to some gaming news.
1354675	1355676	Quickly, housekeeping.
1355976	1357757	Visit our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1357797	1360880	Join us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge.
1361280	1363262	And we're also on Twitter as OLR.
1363968	1365390	It's like we have a different username everywhere.
1365430	1367213	Sorry about that, but it's kind of a long name.
1367554	1370538	All right, let's get to some gaming news once again.
1371199	1373403	I think y'all know where we're going to go tonight right off the bat.
1374364	1375426	Let's talk about the Atari.
1376628	1377489	Fucking love Atari.
1377590	1378391	Combat rocks.
1380137	1383219	Station.com, part of Sony Online.
1383840	1387802	Apparently, Sony Online has gone down.
1388162	1393485	They suspended their services after they discovered an issue.
1393625	1403911	That issue being that their network was also infiltrated as part of that PlayStation Network infiltration from hackers.
1404391	1405772	Apparently, also, they...
1407133	1434189	lost 12,700 credit card account numbers and 24.6 million accounts were compromised that sucks and of course they're letting everybody know no this wasn't a second attack it was just part of the first attack yeah that makes it all better you know that they got it one swoop instead of twice because twice would just be ridiculous now wouldn't it um
1436337	1438598	So yeah, that does suck.
1439339	1447563	And they really haven't said what they're doing, at least on the Sony Online side.
1447703	1454587	I mean, I know there's a lot of stuff we'll be getting into about the PlayStation Network, but yeah, that sucks.
1455088	1461351	And of course, I think for the people that are playing the games on there, I think you're getting a free month or something.
1462612	1462772	Yeah.
1465349	1470612	It's just kind of interesting that this all comes out the week that, oh yeah, we're going to get the system back online.
1470732	1472332	Oh shit, we got hacked more.
1472472	1473313	But here's the thing, though.
1473773	1477154	It was from an outdated database, they said, from 2007.
1477755	1487019	And it says, of the 12,700 total, 4,300, I guess, were from Japan.
1488119	1491921	And then, I guess, some more from other European countries.
1491961	1493102	They're saying, though, that...
1495575	1509662	that the US credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates not the security codes were part of that database I actually have kind of a crazy question has anyone asked this question of Sony yet?
1509742	1515085	I'm not sure but I've got to put it out there why the fuck did they have credit card information from 2007?
1515505	1518626	why are they not required by law to purge that information?
1519387	1520187	why do they need it?
1520527	1522448	you don't need credit card information from 2007 do you?
1525051	1528635	I mean, maybe they need it for tax banking, balance purposes.
1528655	1530817	It might be a server backup or something like that.
1530877	1531317	I don't know.
1531818	1532779	Well, I don't care.
1532879	1534580	You should have to purge that by law.
1535742	1536442	I don't understand.
1536843	1547954	The only benefit of keeping information on this just comes from working with loans is that you can go back and find issues where people have done fraud and you have to track back data that far.
1549301	1554825	But at the same time, a lot of places will have server warehouses or backups or whatever.
1554845	1560709	They'll pay a third-party company to backup everything in another branch somewhere.
1560769	1567674	I know our company, I roll my eyes every time they mention something like this.
1567995	1570757	They have a place in Arizona that's like a...
1572198	1574500	A place that other companies send their data.
1574900	1586969	In case something catastrophic happens and the company is incinerated, at least all this data is backed up in Arizona, in a mountain, something like that.
1587970	1593234	A little crazy, but hey, if a company as small as ours is doing something like that...
1594335	1605159	Sony should be storing it in the bottom of a volcano in the middle of some sort of evil lair in the ocean or something or in the bottom of an iceberg in Antarctica or something.
1605179	1605499	I don't know.
1605659	1608180	Also, DarkSakura, you worked for a bank, right?
1608200	1610301	I worked for a mortgage company owned by a bank.
1610942	1630304	a financial institution needing that information for that long I get that way more than I do Sony needing that information Sony is not a financial institution I think having the information backed up on a separate server is one thing having it still an active memory for lack of a better description that's kind of dumb
1632429	1633970	I can see holding on to the information.
1634531	1637133	Especially for purposes of bookkeeping and accounting.
1639255	1641317	But it was how long?
1641497	1641857	How old?
1641877	1641857	2007.
1642217	1643338	Here's the thing they were saying though.
1643358	1644239	Of the 12,700 cards stolen, 900 were still active.
1644319	1645380	Oh, well it's just 900 then.
1645400	1646541	Why are we even making this an issue?
1646581	1647382	Those 900 people can suck it.
1661368	1661648	Wow.
1663449	1669171	All right, SalaciousPop in our chatroom shines a little light on this, saying, I'm pretty sure they are.
1669251	1674893	Going back two years or more at the porn place, we were only allowed to archive the last four digits and expiration date.
1675233	1676293	And DarkSakura was right.
1676333	1681555	It was in case we were ever subpoenaed or anything, I had to look up legacy order history re-sketchy use of a card.
1681855	1684176	Like if it wasn't stolen and a relative was using it.
1684456	1687117	But the whole card number was purged after a year, I think.
1687157	1687857	Yeah, that's kind of the...
1688677	1695882	A transaction history, I get that, but the card number and data itself, that is very weird.
1696162	1698103	Tax audits would be the only thing I could think of.
1699244	1702886	Even then, doesn't your bank take... Why did Sony need that?
1702926	1704547	Sony's bank having that, I get it.
1704627	1705727	Sony having it, I don't.
1706748	1708549	There's a huge problem I have with that.
1710461	1715327	Hence why we turn to Congress and why Congress is getting involved with all of this right now.
1715768	1718010	And Sony actually responded to Congress this week.
1718030	1724018	You might remember last week we talked that Congress was getting involved, writing a nice little letter to Sony going, what the fuck is going on?
1724318	1726320	Did you put all these Americans' information at risk?
1726360	1727342	You know, just basically in a...
1727802	1728362	Nutshell there.
1729323	1737547	Kazurai sent an open letter back to Congress detailing Sony's various principles and how they've been dealing with the PlayStation Network outage and all the various leaks.
1738427	1742189	It is on various blogs all over the place for you to take a look at.
1743009	1745370	They also summarized it on the PlayStation blog.
1746251	1750252	They had various principles that they worked with during this whole issue.
1750893	1752193	Act with care and caution.
1752633	1755735	Provide relevant information to the public when it has been verified.
1756135	1758919	Take responsibility for our obligations to our customers.
1760040	1761822	Work with law enforcement authorities.
1762803	1765346	Also, they've talked about the timeline for the attack.
1766287	1767649	They said, quote, Oh my God, hold on.
1776079	1777641	They hacked my computer too.
1777701	1780263	Look, there's a text file right here that says we are Legion.
1780943	1781724	That's impossible.
1781964	1783125	Only they could have done that.
1783386	1788510	It's impossible that anybody else could create a text file that says we are Legion and they're named anonymous.
1788790	1789871	How is this possible?
1790332	1791212	How did they do this?
1791733	1792954	I thought my network was secure.
1796004	1804667	There was also a text file named Crayola in the system, apparently, with the names of 256 flavors of crayons.
1805247	1807208	I don't know why they had that, but it was in the system.
1807568	1808488	I have a comment on this.
1808648	1809249	Yes, Dan!
1809509	1810109	How are you, Dan?
1810289	1824374	Does anybody else find it ironic that our government is mad at Sony because when Sony overreacted to somebody hacking their system, the hackers came back to get them and it backfired on them, right?
1825307	1826769	And we do that all the time.
1827289	1827790	That's what we do.
1827830	1828571	We're Americans.
1829412	1831635	We're like, that country's thumbing their nose at us.
1832155	1832916	Let's go get them.
1833417	1835259	Five years later, fuck.
1835940	1837141	What were we thinking?
1837381	1837962	Come on, guys.
1838623	1839444	Give Sony a break.
1839524	1840125	They're dealing.
1840345	1843028	But at the same time, you know, that's what they get.
1843449	1843769	Fuckers.
1846048	1846768	Sega!
1847349	1853470	Well, you know, I have blamed on this show an awful lot.
1853751	1856732	The problem is Sony lies with the way they're being managed.
1856972	1860533	They are a horribly managed company right now.
1861053	1862974	Horribly managed company.
1863494	1868255	And the only thing that is more horribly managed than Sony is the government.
1868735	1873217	So this whole exchange, really, like when I read about it, this is what I hear in my head.
1882363	1888705	And it's great because they're like, oh, we think Anonymous did it because there was this text file.
1889385	1902809	Yeah, wow, that's proof right there that somebody, you know, it couldn't have been any other hacker whatsoever that put that text file in there to maybe divert attention away from them and to Anonymous.
1906198	1913586	Or it could have been... Keep in mind, you've got a group that's decentralized and leaderless, pretty much.
1915137	1918399	So you can't control what everybody who might be associated with it does.
1918579	1920060	I've got more on that in just a moment.
1920100	1921280	Let me get that here.
1921340	1926783	By the way, Sony says they still have yet to identify the individual or individuals that are responsible for the breach.
1927323	1940110	Of course not, because oh my god, it would be... The minute it is identified who did this, and if Sony in any way possible can tie it to Anonymous, it's gonna be like the headline on every fucking website out there, like...
1940630	1943012	Anonymous not so anonymous anymore.
1943392	1945093	Meet the face of Anonymous.
1945133	1950176	Whoever gets caught with this is going to get drugged through the proverbial street.
1950376	1951917	It is retarded.
1952117	1955759	Once again, you're saying that this is a group with no real leadership.
1956099	1957900	There are people that are leaders or whatever.
1957920	1962663	There are people that are acting on their own on this website.
1962923	1964004	Basically, it's 4chan.
1964504	1966065	Let's just not even call it Anonymous anymore.
1966145	1968126	It's 4chan.
1968846	1969567	On top of that...
1971739	1982141	If you don't have a... If it's not really a group that has any sort of, you know, structure to their membership or anything that anybody can claim membership to it, then you can't even really go after the group.
1982281	1988802	You have to say it's this person that did it because it's not anonymous because not all of them participated in it.
1988982	1991483	It's this one dude that says he's an anonymous.
1991683	1997684	Like, if I said I'm an anonymous right now and I kick Jamie, is she going to go sue anonymous because, you know...
1999185	2000586	No, I wouldn't bother suing you.
2000626	2001746	I'd just punch you in the face.
2003488	2006390	Dude, DarkSakura's gonna punch Anonymous in the face.
2006490	2009873	No, or I'd, you know, make, put Shermie poop in your soda or something.
2010954	2015657	It's just, it's... It's dumb, is what it is.
2017218	2018619	All right, I need to get some more.
2018660	2022322	Speaking of Anonymous, they, of course, have denied responsibility for this.
2023403	2024124	Yes, sorry.
2024204	2027827	And I hate bringing up these guys, but...
2029485	2037533	You may remember back a certain people griefing said podcasts that were part of a certain forum.
2039014	2040996	So Anonymous was griefing this podcast.
2043238	2044519	I mean, that's how retarded this is.
2044539	2047082	Jamie, go punch them in the face.
2047122	2048083	Falcon Punch!
2049724	2050145	It's just...
2051345	2055471	Alright, look, you can't claim that the group is behind it because there is no group.
2055652	2060779	It's just people that say that they're part of this group, so you'll just find who's behind it.
2060939	2062462	It's people, not a group.
2063043	2066688	Alright, look, speaking of Anonymous, they did send a statement to The Guardian.
2066728	2066928	I'm not...
2067389	2068430	EvilCouncil EvilCouncil
2097815	2102179	Anyway, the statement said, Poop poop fart.
2126533	2129284	I mean, seriously, who's to say that since it's...
2131243	2150546	But then, apparently, according to a different report in the Financial Times, two veteran members of Anonymous that I guess the Financial Times knew, I guess they weren't that anonymous, but somehow they got in touch there, saying that some element of that original attack was probably the likely reason.
2150886	2153287	The word likely was involved.
2153767	2160048	And then, according to these veteran members, quote, if you say you are anonymous and do something as anonymous, then anonymous did it.
2163720	2172647	Well, regardless, whoever did this, I mean, whoever did this is going to be in a whole lot of trouble if they ever get found out.
2173007	2173788	If they ever get found out.
2173808	2175989	It's going to be public embarrassment, I mean, at this point.
2176049	2178811	But, yeah, if they do, I mean, you know.
2179011	2179612	It's all right.
2179792	2182274	Loki's Sony systems are unhackable.
2185596	2188378	They're prevented against all types of intrusions.
2188398	2190360	Right?
2190380	2190560	Right.
2192216	2194660	You know why they can't find anybody to hack the systems?
2194680	2195802	Because I did it with my mind.
2198767	2199869	All this credit card's gone.
2200450	2201592	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2201612	2204317	Oh, and then I put that text file there so they'll never know it's me.
2205492	2216795	Well, Sony has basically, because they're still wallowing in their own poop like retarded monkeys, they have decided that, oh, we could do something to help these people, maybe.
2217355	2223317	So they are partnering with Debix, D-E-B-I-X, to give 12 months of identity theft protection for free.
2224617	2229619	Also, not just the 12 months, but also adding the time that the service was out, too.
2230760	2238888	Um, so there should be offers coming out over the next few days with the promotional code for the service and people will have until June 18th to register for it.
2240069	2251400	Um, I'm wondering though if this is going to be some sort of, ooh, do we have to pay for a longer term if we get this as like a free, you know, it better be completely free, no strings attached.
2251440	2252141	That's my thing.
2254279	2276018	But basically it's saying that what the All Clear ID service is going to have is cyber monitoring and surveillance of the internet to detect exposure of All Clear ID plus customers' personal information, a million dollar identity theft insurance policy per user to provide additional protection in case All Clear becomes a victim of identity theft, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2276238	2279699	So remember, hackers, you need to wait until... Until they sign up for it.
2279719	2286361	Until June 18, 2012 to do all the stealing of identities so those bastards aren't covered at all.
2286841	2287761	That'll suck it to them.
2287802	2293623	What you do is you make... Okay, hacker people, make friends with your victim and then say, okay, I'll hack you and we'll split the money.
2295804	2295904	No.
2298416	2299397	Jamie, shame on you.
2300438	2301959	It's just too little too late.
2303300	2315231	And on top of that, you know, identity protection services are really such... I mean, this one says, oh, we'll cover your legal costs and blah blah blah, but really, all you have to do is go to your bank and your bank covers this shit.
2316352	2345724	you cancel your cards unless somebody has gone out and done something wholly illegal like shoot somebody in the face and then leave your driver's license on them which I don't see anybody about to go do then that's different and don't use that as an idea I'll leave a card that says anonymous on it when I shoot them in the face and then they'll think that they murdered them just write out we are legion in their blood you spell it out with their entrails I think the intestine is long enough for that
2347048	2347388	Girl.
2348189	2348549	What?
2351590	2352351	You got problems.
2352771	2354052	I do not have problems.
2354272	2355152	I have solutions.
2356013	2360375	And I want to know what this is that you linked me that's supposed to do with Europe that isn't anything about Europe.
2361635	2365777	Somebody made a mistake in our little show roll thread and you got the wrong thing.
2365797	2367738	Well, apparently they're trying to do the same thing for Europe.
2367979	2368279	The end.
2371080	2371580	And there you go.
2372241	2372641	Mm-hmm.
2374210	2377072	So, can I read this comment from our chatroom real quick?
2377392	2382876	Amiga777 in our chatroom says, like some people on the net say, gaming needs a WikiLeaks.
2383917	2390962	I don't know, in theory that's kind of a neat idea, but I don't know if the gaming community could handle something as serious as WikiLeaks.
2391583	2393124	Gaming needs a Perez Hilton.
2393204	2394865	That's what gaming needs.
2394925	2396246	Something a little more bitchy.
2396266	2398268	That's what our website should do.
2398288	2399188	Okay.
2400189	2401750	Draw cocks on people's faces.
2401770	2402950	I know, that would be great.
2402970	2404751	Little coke noses on Marcus Fenix.
2404931	2405431	Let's do it.
2407932	2409252	Loki.
2409752	2412173	Yeah, I'm not about to go draw cocks on people's faces.
2412993	2418415	Unless I put anonymous below it and then, you know, they'll think that they drew cocks on people's faces.
2419976	2420276	Ah, yeah.
2420436	2423697	Anyways, so the PlayStation Network is supposed to come up this week.
2424517	2426599	But as you know, it's not up this week.
2427239	2427920	What the hell?
2441583	2445566	Based on, you know, this is when we held the press conference in Japan last week.
2446107	2450070	Based on what we knew, we expected to have services online within a week.
2450630	2460657	We were unaware of the extent of the attack on Sony Online's servers, and we're taking this opportunity to conduct further testing of the incredibly complex system.
2461278	2465001	I might add, the incredibly complex and poorly guarded system.
2467142	2467983	Yeah.
2471055	2472095	So it's not coming back this week.
2472475	2473115	Surprise, surprise.
2473996	2490058	And apparently, there's some stuff that came out from... To be fair, Loki, I mean, if I'm understanding correctly, what exactly Sony is having to do right now, they are basically having to rewrite the entire fucking PlayStation Network in two weeks.
2491299	2493799	A process that took months to begin with, right?
2493859	2494239	Am I right?
2494939	2495899	That's kind of what they're doing.
2495919	2498480	They're talking about reconstructing the whole fucking thing from the ground up.
2499386	2499686	See this?
2500507	2502909	It's the tiniest violin playing it for them.
2503930	2508875	I feel so bad for them that they had to create an entirely new database.
2508955	2517604	If only they had known that their database were poorly updated and just not ready for any sort of hacker attack.
2518204	2530116	Oh, but they did because... I legitimately do feel sorry for everybody that's having to work plenty of overtime right now, probably mandatory overtime trying to fix this situation when it's really not their fault.
2531018	2534220	Well, it's somebody's fault they made decisions and unfortunately that's the way it works.
2534300	2538804	Yeah, but it's like the grunts are having to pay for the Queen Bee's decision and that's very unfortunate.
2540585	2545909	This situation will never get better until Howard Stringer comes down.
2546009	2548111	You don't like it, you don't work there.
2549611	2550793	That seems pretty simple to me.
2551854	2560946	Anyway, so some information coming out of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade.
2561046	2561987	Wow, that's a long title.
2562748	2564531	According to the breach.
2565512	2567915	And this I had to laugh at a little bit too because I think
2568564	2573228	From what I heard, it's some guy saying that he read somewhere on a forum this information.
2574129	2575129	I hope that's not the case.
2576450	2591723	Apparently, they're saying that Sony had learned several months ago that the PlayStation Network was hosted on servers running very old versions of Apache software that were unpatched and had no firewall installed.
2593601	2594321	No firewall.
2594581	2595602	That's awesome.
2595662	2597202	I think that was debunked.
2597662	2606405	I think some other internet thing looked into it and found that no, there's caches out there that prove that that isn't the case.
2606745	2607025	Okay.
2607166	2613328	So this is just a case of Congress misunderstanding something and further complicating the situation.
2613608	2614008	Exactly.
2616843	2625428	Well, like, I even remember reading this, and I had to find it, because I actually read part of maybe the transcript or something like that, where they were quoted.
2625928	2632992	Yeah, I had read on a forum that this was... They literally said, I read this on a forum.
2633312	2635373	You're taking a forum as fact.
2636834	2637234	Awesome.
2638335	2639496	Nothing wrong with that at all.
2640316	2645679	Now, Sony, I read this on a forum, and I understand you like mudkips, right?
2646018	2648280	Can you explain to me, Sony, what is a mudkip?
2648660	2651422	Hey, I read here on another forum... That's fucking Nintendo.
2651682	2655285	It totally told me where the WMDs were in Iraq.
2655365	2656426	There's WMDs there.
2656746	2657627	This forum said so.
2657667	2658387	We need to go.
2658948	2659388	Right now.
2662093	2662813	They would never be wrong.
2663894	2664674	And then this is great.
2664955	2668677	Apparently there is a rumored third attack planned for Sony.
2670678	2674321	So it says... And this is great.
2676382	2679664	Let's just read through this and laugh at the source.
2680505	2687750	A group of hackers says that they're playing another wave of cyber attacks against Sony in retaliation for its handling of the PlayStation Network breach.
2688811	2689431	Wait, wait, wait.
2691532	2694854	because you're mad about the way they're handling the situation.
2696795	2699837	Your plan is to hack them again.
2699857	2703519	Hey, listen, we're going to hack you again.
2703539	2703719	Oh, my God.
2705928	2707929	An observer... Wait, wait, hold on.
2708070	2708570	This is great.
2708610	2710391	This is where this is coming from.
2710931	2724000	An observer of an internet relay chat channel used by hackers told Cena... So it's a guy in a chat room that witnessed random people talking... Hold on.
2724321	2724661	Hold on.
2725261	2725601	Hold on.
2733507	2733987	I'm holding.
2734007	2734608	I'm waiting.
2734628	2735028	I'm waiting.
2739402	2742464	Oh my god!
2744225	2744685	Oh my god!
2744946	2745706	Report the news!
2746206	2747647	Apparently I just hacked Sony!
2747907	2753771	It said so in this internet relay channel, so... Um, yes.
2758168	2759189	That's really credible.
2759209	2766534	That's about one step below forum posts, but hey, I guess that's fact.
2768456	2775120	Should the planned attacks succeed, it would be the latest blow in a series of devastating attacks.
2775320	2775601	That's right.
2775901	2779363	Should the attack succeed, it would be another attack against Sony.
2779423	2781785	Wow, that's great reporting.
2784653	2788734	And Titilitis in our chat says, I have a hankering to watch Hackers now.
2788874	2792956	Crash Override, Zero Cool, Angelina Jolie.
2794576	2796176	That's what they should have put in there.
2796417	2802418	They should have put all that stuff, like Hack the Planet and all this crap from the Hackers movie.
2802438	2803378	That would have been hilarious.
2811573	2811933	I can't.
2812053	2812293	I can't.
2832683	2833464	Will they really?
2833584	2837666	I mean, now it's, I realize I've said that on the show before, and it's usually pretty true.
2837787	2842370	Like, you know, most people have pretty much forgiven Microsoft for the whole Red Ring of Death thing at this point.
2842710	2846692	You know, and a lot of folks have forgiven other gaming companies for their massive fuck-ups.
2846773	2852016	But, I mean, we're going on day 18, and this could be, like, literally a month before this is fixed.
2852376	2859141	I mean, we might forget what happened, but will the developers, who've now lost a month of sales, forget what's happened?
2859561	2862023	And we are getting dangerously close to E3.
2862763	2864044	E3 is less than on the way
2888553	2892574	Now, I'm sure at least the multiplayer gaming and all that crap will be back and home will be up and all that.
2892814	2897855	But if the store's not up, I'm saying, which is the hardest part, I think, for them to fix, it's going to be interesting.
2897935	2900736	Like, the keynote is going to be really weird this year.
2900796	2902736	It's going to be so weird.
2903216	2905237	Like, it's just going to be a train wreck, I think.
2905257	2910638	Well, especially if they're going to be talking about, like, you know... It's going to overshadow whatever they're showing.
2910738	2913119	And there's some awesome, like, The Last Guardian and shit.
2913139	2914359	Like, I want to know more about that.
2914639	2915300	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2941063	2944185	I'm curious to see how many times... And we should have a betting pool on this.
2944285	2945305	Actually, you know what?
2945385	2946426	I have the week off of work.
2946506	2947687	What I would love to do... You do?
2948087	2948427	Yeah, I do.
2948687	2951609	So what we need to do, we need to have a Sony press conference drinking game.
2952309	2954230	And we each need to pick a word.
2954530	2956531	And every time we hear that word, we're going to take a shot.
2956592	2958232	And my word is going to be secure.
2958753	2962815	So every time we hear the word secure at the PlayStation...
2963735	2964375	E3 press conference.
2964395	2965856	I'm going to take a shot.
2966056	2973578	I'm going to put even odds that I will end up in the hospital at the end of the PlayStation press conference.
2976859	2977419	I pick hacker.
2978960	2981880	Am I trying to kill myself in this or not?
2982661	2983841	What type of word?
2983921	2985201	I'm trying to kill myself.
2985462	2988202	What word would you pick to make yourself end up in the hospital?
2989083	2989903	PlayStation.
2989923	2990303	PlayStation.
2995017	2996799	No, you can't pick that, dummy.
2996959	2998261	You never said I couldn't.
2998621	2998841	Fine.
2999122	2999622	Sony.
2999642	3002946	You can't pick Sony either, and you can't pick NGP or whatever.
3004868	3005568	You're no fun.
3005609	3006229	Three.
3006730	3007831	Oh, God, I hate you.
3008692	3009032	All right.
3009973	3010534	Let's move on.
3010634	3014178	And then, of course, finally, Sony, this is great.
3014879	3015119	They're...
3017853	3027299	Apparently, now I don't know if I should really trust this since it's also from CNET, the website that gets their information from people that saw internet relay chats.
3028639	3035824	But apparently they're saying that Sony is weighing in weather to offer a reward for the information on the hackers behind the massive network outage.
3037184	3039366	So they're going to put out a reward.
3039406	3040726	It's going to be all Milt Gibson.
3040767	3042147	Here's a million dollars.
3042868	3043528	Find them.
3043728	3044389	Give me back my son.
3051435	3053437	Yes, that's exactly what's gonna happen.
3055980	3057121	I need you to find these actors.
3057141	3057802	Give me back my network!
3059283	3060444	And give me back my son!
3065552	3075298	Also, I guess, Sony has denied allegations made in the congressional testimony on Thursday that the servers were not running under the most current security update.
3075318	3078500	Of course, this is the previous network for Sony Network Entertainment.
3079080	3089066	International and Sony Online Entertainment used servers that were patched and updated recently and had multiple security measures in place, including firewalls, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3091768	3092588	Well, you know what?
3092688	3093949	Here's what I have to say about that.
3095359	3099286	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
3110424	3110944	Give me back my son!
3138791	3140613	Actually, I think the reward's a pretty good idea.
3140974	3149343	I think the reward, you know, what better way to get all these guys to turn on each other than put a million dollars on the line, right?
3150164	3152967	It's actually a pretty smart move on Sony's part, if they do it.
3153688	3154188	If they do it.
3155049	3156049	But we'll see.
3157670	3160231	Yeah, I'm just – I'm so looking forward to the E3 press conference.
3160251	3162832	But anyway, I don't know what else to say about the situation at this point.
3162932	3168053	I feel like there's just – you just – like do you remember the Ricky Lake talk show in the 1990s?
3168093	3169094	Do you remember Ricky Lake?
3169114	3169654	I remember Ricky Lake.
3169674	3170014	Go, Ricky.
3170034	3171354	Do you remember Ricky Lake?
3171815	3178597	Do you remember how like whenever her guests would just get like totally out of control on the stage, she just got to be standing there with a microphone or jaws just all dropped like –
3179677	3180618	Like, that's me right now.
3180638	3181898	I'm out of my element.
3181978	3182558	Exactly.
3182619	3192623	Like, I'm just kind of looking at the stage and all these people fighting and Sony and Anonymous and Congress and I'm just looking and I'm just... My mouth just dropped and I'm shaking my head.
3192943	3195345	That's all I've got left to say on this situation.
3199542	3200643	So let's talk about something else.
3200703	3201303	DarkSakura.
3202244	3202504	Yes.
3202644	3203285	Oh wait, no, I'm sorry.
3203325	3203985	I have one other thing.
3204025	3204225	Sorry.
3204305	3204826	Whoops, my bad.
3204886	3205286	Whatever.
3205906	3208368	It's PlayStation related, but it's not about the hack.
3209229	3211210	It has to do with PlayStation Rewards.
3211990	3212511	Remember this?
3213071	3214892	Well, you may not because it never really happened.
3215172	3219015	But there was a beta program that ended on March 31st.
3219535	3229182	And an exclusive t-shirt was sent to the beta testers who got to one of the tiers in this PlayStation Rewards loyalty program.
3229622	3253580	and they were sent a thank you card saying wear it proud and yes they got a t-shirt from this Sony literally sent these people a t-shirt that pretty much says I participated in a Playstation beta and all I got was this lousy t-shirt that's awesome okay now DarkSakura sorry
3254928	3257818	Sony, you suck How about something free?
3258100	3260428	Something happy and free and not at all related to Sony
3261784	3263885	There is a Thor game.
3263925	3266567	It's a 16-bit browser-based platformer.
3267187	3270729	It is called Thor Bring the Thunder.
3271610	3274632	And it's basically like Thor but done Mega Man style.
3275472	3277433	So it looks pretty neat.
3279094	3280095	I think I would want that.
3281356	3285598	And there actually is a DS version.
3287219	3288320	Either out or to be out.
3289180	3290141	Yeah, it said May 3rd.
3290720	3292181	I was going to cue my wine.
3292221	3296543	If this is just a 16-bit game, why couldn't virtual console be used for something like this?
3296603	3297964	But no, that's too smart.
3298064	3300966	That would be something new and innovative.
3301006	3301426	I'm sorry.
3302867	3305568	I like the idea of at least a free game able to play online that ties into Thor.
3305588	3306569	Thor has the Rainbow Road.
3309610	3310791	I haven't seen the new movie yet.
3312672	3312912	Okay.
3314693	3315693	I hear it's not bad, actually.
3315754	3316394	In the comics.
3317154	3318835	Well, I'll go ahead and I'll use Ultimates.
3319495	3322997	He summons a freaking rainbow that brings Asgardian heroes to Earth.
3324217	3334422	He brings the mightiest warriors in all of reality on the Rainbow Road to kick ass for Norse justice.
3336551	3343834	and I always like that's very Norse and his level in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has Rainbow Road in the background.
3345215	3346195	I think he's really Mario.
3346355	3348376	You know what my favorite part of the Thor movie is though?
3348636	3348836	What?
3349156	3350437	Give me back my son!
3350597	3351557	Oh, I'm sorry.
3351597	3351897	I'm sorry.
3351917	3353058	That wasn't Thor at all actually.
3353098	3356299	I've actually seen part of it but just for a cameo that makes me super excited.
3357240	3359581	Oh, the whole Avengers tie-in thing or something else?
3359601	3363242	Yeah, but one of my favorite Avengers characters popped up.
3363502	3363782	Okay.
3363842	3364503	Makes me super happy.
3364723	3365303	There you go.
3366650	3367450	Alright, moving on.
3367730	3368751	I'll give you a clue.
3371132	3371752	It's Mel Gibson.
3372852	3381595	Let's travel the world and see what games are coming out soon in a gaming store near you and what games you can play to help take your mind off of the Benny Hill theme song.
3383204	3387287	This week we've got some, actually a pretty decent selection of titles.
3387987	3389268	LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean!
3389729	3397794	Because you know there's a new Pirates movie, and there are LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean toys, so it only makes sense that there's a LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean game.
3398314	3403137	And that's out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3403177	3407961	There is some online co-op play, except if you're on the PlayStation Network, because you can't play on the PlayStation Network right now.
3408961	3415264	Brink coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week.
3415425	3420307	Also with online co-op and multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 3 because the PlayStation Network is down now.
3420687	3421228	Alright, I'll stop.
3423249	3423909	Yu-Gi-Oh!
3424449	3428972	50s World Championship 2011 from Konami on Nintendo DS.
3430913	3434434	The First Templar from Calypso on Xbox 360.
3436756	3439018	and... Oh, I guess LEGO Pirates was on PSP.
3439178	3439959	How did I forget that?
3440699	3444682	Virtua Tennis 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3444822	3444902	And...
3451414	3453936	Dream Trigger, finally coming out on the 3DS.
3454496	3457979	Actually though, now that I've seen gameplay of it, I am not picking that game up.
3458199	3459160	What's Dream Trigger all about?
3459380	3462662	It was a music kind of shoot-em-up game.
3463443	3465104	But it was really weird looking.
3465625	3466986	I thought it was going to be kind of like Rez.
3467466	3483139	but it's not, it's like you have to tap the screen on the bottom and it creates like a little radar thing and you see enemies not my thing if it was like Rez I'm taking a peek at a little trailer here that's on the YouTube
3484600	3486440	Don't shut up.
3486480	3487261	I don't want to hear this.
3487301	3493882	And then, last but not least, MX vs. ATV Live coming out from THQ on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3494382	3498803	And of course, this is one of the first games that THQ is experimenting with their lower-priced games.
3499103	3503144	It's only $40 retail, and they're going to have download content every two weeks.
3503685	3509686	So, hey, if you want to support that type of thing and try to maybe get the prices of games down, then that'd be the way to go.
3511487	3512907	I hear it's supposed to be pretty good.
3513447	3515828	And that's it for this week.
3515848	3518329	I found a working where some dude isn't talking over it.
3518389	3518709	Hold on.
3519809	3527232	I really hate sometimes that literally anyone can upload things to YouTube because I hate the people that just take someone else's YouTube and do their own thing over it.
3527252	3528052	It irritates me.
3528092	3528352	Hold on.
3528372	3529952	Dream Trigger.
3530293	3530853	Dream Trigger.
3533604	3535606	The next generation of handheld shooters is here!
3536066	3537507	Mind Warping 3D!
3539949	3541250	Over 50 levels!
3543812	3545513	Collectible trophies and multiplayer!
3546014	3546694	Wait, trophies?
3546874	3547855	On a 3DS game?
3548195	3548656	Hold on.
3550757	3557522	Seems like on the bottom screen you have to tap it and you see where the enemies are on the top screen and then you have to shoot them.
3558323	3558603	Weird.
3560947	3570235	I mean, it might be cool, but it's just, you know... I've already gotten three 3DS games that I don't play, and so I don't really need to add a fourth to it.
3570435	3572437	So, you know, I'll wait until...
3575040	3578062	I'll tell you what, D3, because they're the publisher of that game.
3578462	3581143	You really want me to play a game on the 3DS?
3582044	3583925	You'll port it over Earth Defense Force.
3584825	3585946	Because that would be awesome.
3585966	3586806	You might get your wish.
3587266	3588847	At least bring the PSP version over.
3588867	3589327	You know what?
3589627	3592169	I'll get my PSP working again for that.
3593329	3596130	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates.
3596150	3601372	This week on the Xbox 360, Major League Baseball 2K11 comes out on May 12th.
3601672	3609994	I should point this out, Portal 2 is out next week, and I wonder if that's a localization of the game, like if they've actually redone the voice acting and so forth.
3610534	3611174	I don't know.
3611675	3613795	It's in a lot of languages, let me put it that way.
3614035	3619177	Okay, well maybe it's just the same version we have here, it's just finally getting its Japanese release, I don't know, but...
3619797	3621919	I wonder what GLaDOS sounds like in Japanese.
3621959	3622279	That's all.
3622399	3623039	That's all I want to know.
3623319	3623960	But that's next week.
3624280	3630964	They should give her like an old Japanese man voice or whatever.
3632485	3641471	On the PlayStation 3, Major League Baseball 2K11 is out there as well as Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsuyasu comes out this week.
3641611	3642312	It's Haruhi.
3642952	3644513	It's the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
3644973	3647716	Oh yeah, this is the same anime manga universe.
3648017	3651261	So this is the game coming out on PS3 this week.
3651961	3653183	A whole game about that series.
3654604	3659250	There's also a box edition, a special box edition on that if you want to get that, if you're a big fan of the anime.
3660190	3661952	On the Nintendo Wii, nothing.
3662472	3665174	On the 3DS, Steel Diver is out this week in Japan.
3665655	3668997	Of course, that was a launch game for us here, but they're just now getting that in Japan.
3669618	3675703	And lastly, on the PSP, Planetarian.
3676223	3678425	and Shisana Hoshino Yume.
3678665	3679926	That's a charity edition.
3680166	3681067	I'm not sure what that means.
3681587	3684389	If that's a price reduction or something where the money goes to charity.
3685090	3694137	I don't have any translation on this but it does look like the game is kind of one of those like cyber anime space robot things.
3695017	3702644	and also another version of Suzumiya Haruhi is coming out there on the PSP as well.
3702704	3705947	And lastly, Makai Senki Disgaea 2 Portable.
3706007	3707068	Of course, Disgaea 2.
3707389	3709951	Getting a price reduction this week on the PSP in Japan.
3709991	3711533	It moves into the best series.
3712233	3712573	There you go.
3712593	3713614	There's your Japanese releases.
3713634	3713995	How about the UK?
3714015	3714155	Okay.
3715339	3716840	We do have a few things for the UK.
3717881	3720782	Let me look at my calendar, because it's going to be another week.
3721063	3722283	Oh, finals week, shoot me.
3723044	3731009	Okay, we have on the 9th, Hydrophobia Prophecy, and on the 11th, Alads Online.
3732670	3736012	And then on the 13th, we've got a few things.
3736052	3739774	We have Brink, Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, and that's it.
3742540	3746003	Just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3746283	3750486	But first... Yes.
3752187	3761814	Apparently, though, and I kind of think I know what this is, Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver is working on a horror Kinect shooter game.
3765177	3769240	There's been rumors for a while now that they're going to be doing a Kinect Halo game.
3770305	3771365	That's probably this.
3771906	3781030	They're saying that the studio's mission is to push the limits of the proven and unexplored game development and show the world what's possible with Microsoft game consoles.
3781830	3788573	That's pretty generic sounding, but if I were to bet money, I would say it's probably going to be a Kinect Halo game.
3790093	3790513	You think?
3791174	3791494	Yeah.
3792014	3794135	There were the rumors before about that anyway.
3794695	3796316	It would be cool if it was something original.
3798583	3813424	or you know they want to be really cool not necessarily I'd want a Kinect version of this but TimeSplitters isn't getting a lot of love lately and I really love a new TimeSplitters game just saying
3815305	3817725	Alright, one other story for you guys.
3817745	3823126	This is another big rumor that's popped up this week and a lot of people kind of ignored it because of everything that's going on with the PlayStation.
3823186	3826327	And honestly, this is probably something that deserved to be ignored.
3827267	3833368	But apparently development kits for a brand new Microsoft consoles were in the offices of one of EA Studios.
3834028	3835229	This is according to a source.
3835429	3842530	They don't work for EA or Microsoft, but they did say that it came in a PC shell and it was shipped to EA last month.
3844011	3852015	I guess there's been rumors already about Xbox 360 dev kits and this was set to sort of dispel that rumor or what have you.
3852115	3852435	I don't know.
3852755	3856817	So of course people are now speculating is Microsoft set to reveal a new console at E3?
3857217	3864141	Well EA's Director of Corporate Communications came out and said in a statement to IGN that that story was quote a total fabrication.
3864181	3864781	It is 100% not true.
3864821	3864901	And
3868323	3874665	You know, there's absolutely no way is there a Microsoft console being shown at E3 this year.
3874825	3876786	I would bet a large sum of money on that.
3876906	3877186	Why?
3877606	3880147	Because Kinect has not lived out its full potential yet.
3880467	3882068	Microsoft's invested a lot in Kinect.
3882468	3884649	Kinect is still, what's that record it has?
3884729	3890871	The best-selling electronic gadget ever, or fastest-selling, I think, electronic gadget ever, more so than the iPhone.
3891591	3893472	It's been crazy popular for them.
3893812	3895974	But yet, that hasn't really reached its full potential.
3895994	3897695	And they're on a 10-year console cycle.
3897735	3900577	They've been stressing that, and that's the whole plan with the Kinect anyway.
3900598	3902199	Yeah, but Nintendo got away with not doing that.
3902479	3904761	But of course, Nintendo never said it was going to be a 10-year cycle for them.
3905001	3905601	Yeah, they never did.
3905862	3907023	So, you know, whatever.
3907463	3917851	But I just... No way are you going to see a new... I mean, of course you might see maybe a redesigned 360 or a 360 with Kinect built in.
3917911	3918191	I don't know.
3918211	3919713	You might see something like that, but I doubt it.
3919853	3920113	I think...
3920513	3929057	It's going to be just more Kinect support and now it's not going to be so much about the dance games, the biggest loser workout games and those things.
3929437	3938021	Now you're going to see the next wave of quote unquote hardcore Kinect games such as this rumored Halo reimagining that's going to be done with Kinect.
3938381	3940282	I think that's what E3 is all about this year.
3940682	3944404	Now how do we take Kinect to the next, like how do we make Kinect not so gimmicky?
3944804	3946065	because you haven't seen any Kinect games.
3946085	3947385	Just make it not gimmicky.
3947405	3948126	I mean, that's it.
3948206	3956369	I mean, what you need to do is, yeah, you realize that you can do, just because you can do something with the hardware doesn't mean you should do something with the hardware.
3956409	3960591	Like, I don't, before, you know, head tracking.
3961311	3970355	That's all you need to, like, for, I don't understand why that's not even available for most first-person shooters nowadays is just have that support in there.
3970435	3973397	Okay, it does a little bit of head tracking if you want to.
3974608	3974968	That's it.
3974988	3976249	That's all you have to add.
3976270	3987059	I mean, if you want to make it so you can throw a grenade by swinging your arm, then cool, but it's not really necessary because it takes a lot more time to swing my arm in a grenade motion than it would to push a button.
3990245	3997347	I think it's going to be all about maybe this head tracking or whatever else technologies are going to put in future games.
3997807	3999208	That's what you're going to see at E3 this year.
3999588	4004269	And of course, Dance Central 2 and sequels to the popular wave of first titles.
4004309	4008450	But really, what Kinect releases have we seen since Christmas?
4009210	4010911	Until now, very, very little.
4011091	4014112	I mean, especially that's not budget knockoff titles.
4014152	4017594	Now, granted, Child of Eden is kind of your lone standout.
4017614	4019515	But that's not a Kinect-only game.
4019555	4020815	That's a game that has Kinect support.
4021055	4022176	But that's okay.
4022676	4024297	I still would consider that a Kinect title.
4024417	4027598	Okay, well, since Christmas, here's what we've had.
4027678	4033399	We've had Dance Paradise, which was a terrible dancing game from THQ.
4034159	4039640	We had the Michael Jackson Experience, which was kind of like Just Dance in a karaoke game.
4040280	4047482	We've had Fantastic Pets, which was a THQ pet sim game that, you know, it's kind of dumb.
4047502	4050442	Every kind of game you've named so far is a derivative of one of the Christmas games.
4051742	4054203	We've had... We've got Two Dance Centrals and Connectimals.
4055282	4055662	Kung Fu Panda 2
4067950	4070412	Michael Phelps, Push the Limit, that's coming out in June.
4070552	4070792	Whoopee.
4070812	4071973	It's a swimming game.
4072073	4075396	Nothing, nothing, I mean, you're stretching to think of things.
4075536	4079639	I mean, there's nothing that just jumps out at you as like an OMG must own title, right?
4080040	4088186	I mean, all these are just, you know, little flashes in the pan because there's nothing else on Kinect right now and people are hoping that they'll buy this crazy shit.
4088587	4092670	You know, people that crave new dance games are going to buy this Dance Paradise or what have you.
4092870	4094031	Dance Paradise is terrible.
4094991	4096112	Don't buy Dance Paradise.
4096912	4097452	How does it work?
4097533	4101054	I don't even... Dance Paradise, it has your avatars in it, for one.
4101355	4103596	So that's how you know that they're not taking the damn thing seriously.
4104636	4110159	Two, it's basically... It's got this interface that looks terrible.
4111520	4117503	You're standing... These outlines of a person are sliding towards you down this...
4119983	4129705	kind of think of it like that hole in the wall show or something like that where you have to move and make a certain gesture or something like that isn't that kind of how Dance Masters works too?
4130885	4146348	sort of but Dance Masters is less you don't really know what's coming up I don't know it's it's an interesting idea but it's really way too Japanese skewed Dance Masters that's for sure but
4149981	4151362	Yeah, there's not a lot out there.
4151782	4152962	People are looking for stuff.
4154843	4159525	Sadly, Michael Jackson Experience is actually probably the best title out of the bunch so far.
4162086	4165207	Because, I mean, it's got Just Dance as the core to it.
4165307	4167988	Because that's basically what the game's built off of.
4175116	4182683	I was pissed at the experience, not from the dance moves, but from being forced to sing.
4183124	4186927	Those comments from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com How can you be forced to sing?
4187248	4188289	The Kinect has a microphone in it.
4190322	4191022	That does suck.
4191163	4193544	You should be able to turn that off.
4193564	4197126	Going back to the original story, though, about the whole dev kit, actually, you know what's funny?
4197246	4200629	I don't doubt that there actually is a dev kit already at EA.
4201089	4216199	I mean, if they are going to announce something next year, which I'd see as a lot more viable, or maybe the year after, I mean, EA and Activision is probably your two biggest publishers, probably have to already be thinking about what launch titles they want to make for it.
4216599	4217780	These games don't take...
4218320	4218800	Thanks for watching!
4232165	4243635	Well, of course not, because, I mean, if anything, these are like alpha kits or something like that, because, you know, let's say that they're sticking to the, you know, five-year or ten-year console cycle, okay?
4243675	4258187	Well, the 360 was out in 05, and, I mean, the way prices are coming down on all electronic stuff, you know, God knows what technology is going to be in five years, or four years, I guess, almost five years.
4259368	4277141	I mean that stuff comes down in price so much I mean if they're like building it off of specs right now like say okay we're gonna have you know a gig of RAM in there or something like that well five years you might be able to afford 16 gigs of RAM for the price of that honestly though a lot of this depends on how much Nintendo ups the ante with what they're doing
4277501	4283867	because if they are hugely successful and they've upped the ante past the specs that 360 and PlayStation 3 has, it's going to force the other two to work faster.
4283907	4286629	Yeah, but I don't know if that's even going to be a big deal.
4286689	4291554	I mean, they're going to have a little bit of an advantage of being first out there, but it's all about how they grasp and use it.
4291734	4293636	But if they're just going to be like...
4294196	4300157	Well, we're out here first, so we're just gonna kick on back, because we don't have to worry about competition.
4300858	4314621	But here's the thing, though, they gotta be way ahead of the game, you know, because if it's just making it just a hair better than, you know, PlayStation 3 or 360, it's all gonna be gameplay then, and if they can't, you know, bring that to the table, then...
4316541	4325345	But I don't think gameplay is a problem for them because before they've all focused on gameplay and graphics have kind of taken a back seat.
4325405	4332727	So if they bring all the visuals and audio and stuff up to snuff, then they have a pretty good system there.
4333488	4334468	But they also can't.
4336510	4336730	We'll see.
4336750	4337070	We'll see.
4337090	4337711	All right, let's move on.
4337731	4339271	We got to get to the classic game of the week.
4359477	4369065	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura takes a stroll to the Classic Gaming Vault and digs in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.
4369265	4373228	You know, there's no network, none of your newfangled networks right now to play things on anyway.
4373428	4374569	Except Xbox Live.
4375090	4377372	So you should go back and revisit this classic game.
4377492	4379073	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4379253	4381455	The classic game of the week is Phantasmagoria.
4383677	4385218	Which was a weird-ass game.
4386716	4390339	Let's do some clips here, if I can get to the two point.
4390419	4394122	I picked one that had some music, but then it went right into more talking.
4395824	4406092	Anyway, Phantasmagoria was on seven CD-ROMs for the PC, and it was released in 1995, which was when I first played it.
4406112	4412278	That was my first full year of college, so it took a lot of time.
4412318	4413118	I should have been studying.
4413158	4413559	But anyway...
4414139	4415140	Victoria Winters
4436101	4442087	At any rate, like I said, it was on seven CDs because it was a lot of video, a ton of video.
4442767	4446571	And actually, most of it was filmed in front of a blue screen.
4446591	4459163	There was something like several hundred different actions that the actress, who was the main character in the game, had to do, like walking to an item, picking something up, doing something.
4459543	4484945	and also it had 550 pages of a script which is about four times the size of a regular movie script and an additional hundred pages of storyboards for the 800 scenes in the game it took four months of filming and 200 people were involved in the productions that's also including that's actually not including sorry the 135 people who were in the Gregorian choir for part of music
4485525	4487527	and the last scene took a week to film.
4488548	4501659	But anyway, it was developed by Roberta Williams who is, she's actually behind King's Quest and it was one of the goriest, most violent games to come out in its time.
4501699	4503400	I mean, it's got an M rating now.
4504101	4506322	It had... Can I look at some of these death scene YouTubes?
4506342	4508024	I want to see how gory this game is.
4508284	4508504	Okay.
4509045	4509585	Let's see here.
4509605	4510726	I want to see some of this here.
4512788	4513508	Let's turn it up.
4514029	4514149	Yep.
4521024	4524870	So she's walking in front of this mirror that's doing a little swirly gas thing.
4537669	4540433	Tonight for you a special feast Regina.
4540453	4542315	I prepared all your favorites.
4544517	4545739	Doesn't this look delicious?
4545959	4550685	For starters, giblets in a rich red marinara sauce.
4557216	4557697	Adrian and Gordon
4569901	4573224	And she's a paperback writer and he is a photographer.
4573284	4579109	So they buy this mansion that's owned by a 19th century magician named Zoltan Karnavash.
4580230	4591781	And so basically, through the course of things, she accidentally releases this demon that had possessed basically Karno, the illusionist.
4592722	4594684	And it possesses her husband.
4594704	4596045	So he goes on this big...
4598249	4598909	and DarkSakura.com
4625840	4626320	Thanks for watching!
4645687	4655231	So, his last wife realizes that he's a murderer, so she and her lover try to kill him, except he comes back and kills them, but they kill him again.
4655752	4656972	And then they all die.
4657352	4658073	So, I don't know.
4658633	4661614	Anyway, it's a lot of gore.
4661774	4666436	A lot of really violent themes.
4668017	4670978	And pretty hardcore stuff.
4671259	4672819	And you're sick if you like this.
4673860	4674180	But...
4676553	4678515	This is so gross, Jamie.
4678796	4680377	This is a gross game.
4681478	4688847	The reason why I'm bringing it up is because at that time, it was really novel for its time.
4689147	4689728	It was...
4692586	4695311	Thank you for watching!
4707188	4710289	You know, it really did kind of push the envelope.
4710329	4715812	And I think it's one of, I'd have to put it in, you know, Grand Theft Auto is nothing compared to that.
4716532	4718273	You know, Grand Theft Auto is my little pony.
4721235	4723976	It's an angel food cake made with whipped cream.
4724276	4724576	I mean.
4725276	4727077	I agree with Dungeon Buster in the chat room.
4727117	4729458	Hard to believe that King's Quest Williams did this.
4730059	4730279	Yeah.
4731079	4732621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4752200	4767970	and it was completely redubbed in Japanese it came on 8 CDs and it was released by OutTrigger in 97 and it was just called Phantasm there and Roberta Williams was asked by Sierra to do a third game but nothing happened
4768910	4790281	and she actually said that Phantasmagoria is the game most representative of her game design career and there was a box set of both called Phantasmagoria Stage Fright in 1995 and actually it just got re-released by Good Old Games in February last year as a digital download.
4791072	4793914	I've actually been totally considering because I haven't played this.
4793954	4798417	So yeah, if you're a sick person and you want to see this sick game, you can go.
4798517	4800258	Oh, that's the final scene too.
4800638	4803420	Oh, is this like OMG spoilers?
4804021	4805261	Oh, yeah.
4805922	4807703	It was just labeled as another death scene.
4809384	4809744	Oh, no.
4809885	4810265	Uh-oh.
4812967	4814187	Oh, my God.
4814247	4814428	Gross.
4814528	4815768	That's if you fail that.
4816509	4819271	Ah, that blade chopped her head in half.
4819867	4840123	Yeah, but she uses it to kill him instead in the actual ending Sick people It's a really, really violent, bloody, gory game But like I said, it was really one that pushed the envelope in those days A lot went into it And for what it is, it's a pretty good game
4841144	4846146	So, and I wouldn't say it's too hard of a game, I mean with the puzzles, but it was pretty good.
4846306	4848267	I remember playing it when I was a lot younger.
4848287	4848867	Night Trap was wimpy.
4849167	4853328	And I'm really glad I wasn't very good at it, because I never got to any of this stuff.
4853368	4857290	I remember playing the game, I borrowed it from my friend, but I was like, I don't get this, I can't play this.
4857450	4862512	So I never got to any of the really gory stuff, so I'm kind of glad, because this is sick.
4863792	4864653	Yeah.
4864993	4865793	Pornography.
4866713	4868714	But it needed to be mentioned.
4870549	4871250	All right.
4871450	4872611	It is one of those classics.
4873872	4874252	All right.
4874573	4876855	That's going to do it for part A of our show.
4876895	4877735	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4877996	4880838	We're going to be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4880858	4885762	We got more stuff coming up in part B. We're going to talk a little bit about some of the pre-E3 stuff that's going on.
4886623	4888465	Some news about Nintendo as well.
4888565	4889125	Lots of stuff.
4889486	4892909	A little bit more WoW because Warcraft did something important this week we want to share.
4893429	4894330	The mailbag as well.
4894490	4895051	FUs of the week.

4909830	4912431	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4912491	4915072	We are live with episode number 412.
4915412	4924416	We're coming into part B. We've of course talked quite a bit about the whole PlayStation debacle in part A. We're going to have a little fun with it here in part B tonight.
4924436	4927197	We're going to do some rapid fire news, some Twitter topics.
4927237	4928397	You want to get those in real quick.
4928757	4935080	And then a little later on we're going to get into tonight's list list, which of course we have to poke fun at what's going on with PlayStation Network.
4935740	4936540	DarkSakura?
4936560	4936841	DarkSakura?
4953786	4955827	It's Comic Insanity, and it's back!
4956707	4957667	We record it today.
4958227	4958747	Yay.
4959508	4965910	And we go... I'm stuck at promos today.
4966510	4981074	We are on Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net, and you can download us every Tuesday, where we talk about comic books and whether or not we care about them, and other geek-worthy news.
4982381	5010970	and it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow and we're awesome I want to also give a plug for my show it's called Horde House the best little Horde House in Azeroth and it's about all things World of Warcraft so if the Warcraft chat earlier in this show just wasn't enough for you there's plenty more that happens with myself and Extifer and Extifer is very very explicit he's more explicit than Phantasmagoria but with dick jokes instead of blood Extifer is the guy who originated the term bleached asshole yes
5011690	5013132	Well, I don't know if he originated that.
5013172	5016075	I believe a stripper somewhere originated that, but he made it popular.
5016095	5016776	But he made it famous.
5017096	5017557	Exactly.
5018238	5020901	Hordhouse.com, H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E.com.
5021662	5023303	A couple other plugs I was asked to give here.
5023384	5025506	Ranma said, please plug Anime Jam Session.
5025526	5026347	And I said, sure.
5026827	5028369	Visit our friends at Anime Jam Session.
5028389	5030592	You can visit their website, animejamsession.com.
5031813	5034916	Anime, video games, cons, cosplay, everything in between.
5034976	5036818	Just throw it all in a blender and there you go.
5036898	5037919	Anime Jam Session.
5037999	5041342	Although it sounds a lot better, trust me, it's actually pretty cool.
5041663	5042223	So check that out.
5042243	5043324	They've got a fun little show there.
5043685	5048630	Also, my buddy Seg joined chat and one of the big things he works on every year is Umlaut.
5049489	5049910	Umlaut.
5049950	5050630	It's very loud.
5050690	5053372	It's a child's play fundraiser.
5054253	5059137	It is rock band all night long, and it has a date for this year, December 8th.
5059578	5063101	Now, I missed it last year, and I was pissed, but, you know, real life happens sometimes.
5063621	5067164	But I'm really trying to make it this year, and I hope you guys can make it too.
5067425	5068365	Book your flights now.
5068425	5069026	It's going to be fun.
5069266	5069767	December 8th.
5070527	5073890	Of course, same place, DNA Lounge, same city, San Francisco, California.
5074611	5075452	But more rock.
5076311	5077092	All right.
5077112	5082477	Let's get to some rapid-fire news and go around and do some quick stories, and then we'll get to the tweets.
5082617	5083818	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5084498	5085419	This is kind of unique.
5086060	5087962	Of course, with the new Rockstar game L.A.
5088002	5095188	Noire coming out next week, they're kind of, I don't know, tying this in with the release of that.
5095588	5101514	They have some collected stories that they're releasing on an e-book format, and
5102314	5103194	and you can check it out.
5103394	5116278	It's basically an anthology of collected Hollywood tales from authors like Megan Abbott Joyce, Carol Oates and Jonathan Sansevier.
5117138	5119819	I don't read books, so I don't know who these are.
5119859	5127801	But apparently, though, I guess they're going to be kind of like 1940s noir detective novels.
5127981	5128841	So that's kind of cool.
5129901	5138265	The first one, of course, they have a little sample you can check out of The Girl, which is Megan Abbott's book.
5138405	5140026	That's going to be the first one coming out.
5140966	5144448	You can check that out on Rockstar's website, rockstargames.com.
5146609	5149890	They'll be right there.
5151671	5154112	Pretty cool little idea, I guess.
5154192	5155793	They're going to have, I guess, eight total.
5158832	5161534	And I'm definitely checking out that game when that comes out next week.
5163674	5165555	And then, this is also pretty cool.
5166356	5175559	With a copy of Battle LA on Blu-ray, you can also get early access to the Resistance 3 demo that'll be on the disc.
5175800	5179561	The demo will be a 30-minute demo that was, I believe, shown off...
5181522	5182122	Thank you for watching!
5211343	5212324	because I'm lucky like that.
5214005	5219669	And then, I love Volition and their Saints Row and Red Faction games.
5219709	5221971	I actually haven't played too much of Red Faction, but I really should.
5222411	5225694	But Saints Row, I mean, they're just very over the top with everything.
5225714	5229917	I don't know if you guys remember from Armageddon or in a
5230497	5231678	Armageddon, Gorilla.
5232138	5236721	Last year, they had an April Fool's weapon that they released that actually became a real weapon.
5237042	5238062	That was an ostrich.
5238322	5242765	It was a melee weapon that you hit people with an ostrich, and that was pretty awesome.
5243966	5247509	Well, now, they have the new weapon, which is called Mr. Toots.
5248149	5259877	It is a unicorn with, it looks like My Little Pony or something like that, that you pull on its tail, and it shoots a rainbow out of its ass that makes people explode.
5261880	5267929	That was in a video that the guy who did the portal video did where he gets a portal gun and his friends don't care.
5269096	5271657	Yeah, well, that was tying in with this, of course.
5272838	5277680	And Mr. Toots, of course, isn't going to be available right away.
5278160	5282342	It will be available, though, if a million people download the demo that is available right now.
5282942	5289745	So after one million downloads of the Red Faction Armageddon demo, Mr. Toots will be unleashed for all to use.
5290886	5291746	And that is awesome.
5292571	5293031	You know what?
5293652	5302179	I gotta say, with a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of its ass, they're really gonna have to step up their game for Postal 3.
5302239	5304681	Because, I'm sorry, a chainsaw badger?
5305121	5306262	That ain't cutting it anymore.
5306883	5308244	Now, a chainsaw honey badger...
5310250	5311832	Naughty Bear was a terrible game, by the way.
5324719	5326621	Yeah, the iPhone one is pretty bad too.
5326681	5328282	Okay, anyway, other tweets.
5328402	5329223	I'm sorry, not tweets yet.
5329283	5329943	We're almost to tweets.
5329983	5331124	But other rapid fire news.
5331985	5334146	This game, apparently it's a rhythm game.
5334186	5339490	For those of you kids that like your rhythm-based games, there's a new game coming out called Pulse Volume 1.
5340611	5342213	This is a game for the iPad.
5342453	5345815	And I guess what this is, it's stationary rings that are in the center of the screen.
5346276	5349038	Each ring is larger than the last with the smallest set in the center.
5349318	5351600	And then the number of rings increase with each difficulty level.
5352300	5357465	As a pulse ring grows outward from the center, orbs follow along the stationary rings.
5357625	5362450	As the music plays, pulse rings appear and reach the orbs to the beat of the song.
5362770	5366974	Scoring is based on the accuracy of orbs hit in correlation with the pulse reaching them.
5367374	5368055	This could be interesting.
5368195	5369336	Here's a little bit of the gameplay.
5369516	5371698	You can kind of hear what some of the music sounds like.
5371738	5374140	You can see it's kind of neat.
5374180	5378364	Each pulse is kind of like one measure in the song, and you've got to tap all the little...
5380490	5384811	It's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets A Map of the Solar System.
5385111	5387552	There you go.
5388912	5389572	That's Pulse.
5390512	5391913	Some news from Harmonix.
5394233	5400915	Stories about the Rock Band download content and where they're at after the post-MTV games breakup.
5401836	5407044	A quote from Chris Rigopoulos, who is the vice president of strategy and business development.
5407684	5414995	He was interviewed by Game Informer saying that, quote, they've effectively severed all ties with MTV and all proceeds from Rock Band belong to Harmonix.
5416457	5422523	Many people thought that, well, the reason why they were getting such awesome download content to begin with was because of their partnership with MTV Games.
5423063	5427807	Now, he continues to say that it has been a collaborative effort between Harmonix and MTV in the past.
5428508	5433793	All the stuff you've seen this year so far, most of that was before Harmonix was sold by Viopcom.
5434213	5442701	Now, the new tracks that will be coming out soon, that's going to give you the first glimpse at some of the music that the company has secured without MTV, and I think Jamie's going to cover that in a minute.
5442981	5444622	and it still sounds pretty good stuff.
5444903	5445723	But I love this.
5446424	5454450	He doesn't expect that there's going to be any drastic changes to the music selection process, but, quote, I doubt you will see any more Spongebob Squarepants packs.
5455131	5455351	Ouch.
5455451	5458774	So I guess that was not something they wanted to do, but they did anyway.
5459014	5460315	Well, yeah, that makes sense.
5460955	5465519	Viacom, you know, I think goes to Nintendo, or not Nintendo, Nickelodeon.
5465579	5466460	MTV and Nickelodeon.
5466580	5467561	Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
5468460	5470342	Also, speaking of Rock Band, this is very important.
5470482	5472924	There will be no Rock Band 4 this year.
5473084	5473824	Yeah, I've not confirmed.
5474385	5476246	Yeah, kind of file that under duh.
5476366	5481671	I mean, it took a couple years for Rock Band 3, but they are not going to be doing a Rock Band 4 this year.
5481711	5484493	And I'm kind of not surprised because Guitar Hero is on hiatus.
5484893	5489255	Rock Band 3 unfortunately didn't sell well and it's a bummer because it's a great title.
5489275	5492195	It's down to $10 at Toys R Us now.
5492476	5497137	Honestly, if you like music games in the slightest, you've got to get Rock Band 3.
5497417	5498117	It's awesome.
5498658	5502519	So take advantage of the $10 sale, I suppose, and go check that out.
5504140	5509425	Probably this year at E3 you're going to see more from harmonics like Dance Central 2 will probably be their big title.
5509766	5510967	Maybe something unannounced.
5511247	5511708	Who knows?
5512769	5516873	Maybe something to take on a different type of music game.
5516893	5520176	There's always been that rumor that they want to revisit the amplitude frequency type of games.
5520676	5521958	That could always be something they show.
5522038	5523339	God, a DJ game would be awesome.
5523679	5524040	We'll see.
5524560	5525922	But no Rock Band 4.
5526402	5530848	Maybe next year or the year after that when people are back into music games.
5530928	5535193	I would say it's going to take until whenever the next series of systems comes out, but we'll see.
5535653	5536094	DarkSakura.
5537458	5542102	There is a PS3 bundle coming out for Black Ops in three weeks.
5542603	5547948	Call of Duty Black Ops will have one that has a hundred... Excuse me.
5549029	5549610	Let me start over.
5551051	5554394	There is a PS3 bundle with Black Ops arriving.
5554434	5555996	It's Call of Duty Black Ops on PS3.
5556456	5559019	It will have a 160 gigabyte hard drive and will be 300 bucks.
5559079	5559139	And...
5562481	5569304	and hopefully we will hear something from Activision and Sony soon but this is still just coming from retail.
5571365	5571765	100% true.
5573026	5575847	Super Meat Boy level editor is out.
5575927	5578948	You can go and download it.
5579028	5579729	It's on Steam.
5580549	5581309	Make some levels.
5581989	5582890	Share them with everybody.
5584631	5585491	And they better not suck.
5586877	5592169	They'll all be hard as hell Aren't all the levels hard as hell?
5592710	5593913	In Super Meat Boy, yeah
5596169	5602532	Well, there is, of course, another rock band pack coming out this month, here in May.
5603212	5607574	There will be tracks from the Foo Fighters album, Wasting Light.
5608515	5612736	And then there will be pro guitar and bass upgrades to older rock band tracks.
5612776	5616638	There will also be some Lady Gaga.
5617559	5618259	Are you happy, Rob?
5619508	5621010	Do You Feel Like We Do, Frampton Comes Alive
5635505	5638427	I love that they have from Lady Gaga to Peter fucking Frampton.
5638828	5640109	Oh, and Ozzy.
5641190	5641970	There will be Ozzy.
5642010	5642471	You know what?
5642551	5643852	I want some damn Lita Ford.
5644893	5646975	I want the Ozzy Lita Ford duet.
5647936	5648997	Close my eyes forever.
5649777	5650298	I love that song.
5651738	5653279	You know what I would like to see in Rock Band?
5653760	5655041	Especially now that they have piano?
5655561	5656022	Meatloaf.
5656282	5656622	Yes.
5658003	5658263	Yes.
5659124	5660866	We need the Rocky download pack.
5660906	5663388	I thought like around Valentine's Day they had some meatloaf stuff.
5663468	5665169	Oh my god, maybe I missed it.
5667031	5669032	I'm checking the list of Rock Band downloads now.
5669873	5673736	I know that there's a couple of... In fact, you were excited about one.
5675277	5675838	I want to say.
5677079	5678380	This is important information.
5678440	5679740	I need to know what Meatloaf song is available.
5679760	5681281	This will complete Rob's life.
5681481	5682042	It really will.
5682502	5684063	Just do a search.
5684283	5685323	Control F Meatloaf.
5685423	5690806	Or I could just alphabetize the list and then scroll down to M. H, I, J, K. Why does it say F?
5691107	5693448	M. There's Megadeth, Megadeth, more Megadeth.
5693468	5693708	Screwed.
5693748	5693948	Okay.
5694809	5695509	One Meatloaf song.
5696069	5697130	One Meatloaf song.
5697190	5698571	Paradise by the Dashboard Light.
5698671	5700672	Because you were giddy about that.
5700772	5701892	That's not enough Meatloaf.
5702693	5703753	There's always room for Meatloaf.
5703773	5704554	Meatbat out of Hell.
5705714	5706695	We need a saxophone controller next.
5726187	5726467	No.
5727288	5728909	If there is, I don't care.
5729390	5731211	Let's get to the Twitter topics then.
5731671	5738377	Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR because of course this is the show where every gamer has a voice.
5739598	5744802	Let's go to the first tweet tonight from let's see, we already covered that story so we'll go to MNZiba.
5745182	5746283	Oh, I remember reading about this too.
5746623	5755030	MNZiba tweeted us saying, The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword GDC 2011 trailer music played backwards is very familiar.
5755670	5762658	so apparently it wasn't to me a person who you know well i'll let you get into that all right so well here here here it is play backwards
5782446	5783887	And this is backwards right now.
5793433	5795595	Now that's a little tune from Ocarina, right?
5796135	5798877	Is that why people are flipping their shit about this?
5799877	5804460	Once again, though, me not really giving a crap about Ocarina of Time, that was totally lost to me.
5805681	5809764	But it's this whole setup because we have the Ocarina of Time re-release coming out first.
5810404	5811025	Eh, big deal.
5811676	5837755	Alright, well that was a tweet from MNZiba Alright, BlueSwimTweet says Rumor has it that Namco Bandai Games America has licensed Sailor Moon And he tweets us to a site that he actually works for But I'm assuming he's going on good authority Oh, I see, Sailor Moon World Italy apparently is the source here Some new companies have acquired licenses for Sailor Moon And one of them is Namco Bandai Games America
5838215	5841962	Oh boy, I hope we get a Kinect Sailor Moon game that we can do the transformation.
5842523	5843686	DarkSakura, would you play that?
5844808	5845148	Maybe.
5845902	5847163	I'm not that acrobatic.
5875086	5878127	So some folks are yelling at me in chat that I didn't go through the whole video.
5879688	5881529	Well, what am I going to see if I go through the whole video?
5883070	5883670	All right.
5883730	5885431	Tell me what I'm going to see, and then I'll go back to the whole video.
5885731	5885991	All right.
5886031	5891313	Going to DJ Ranma S tweets us saying, IGN acquires UGO.
5892474	5893554	No one care.
5893714	5895515	No one care.
5896155	5896436	Great.
5896456	5897996	The corporate collective grows bigger.
5898036	5898457	Congrats.
5898477	5898737	Great.
5898877	5899837	UGO.
5899877	5902158	Now they own 1UP and IGN.
5902578	5902698	Yep.
5902979	5903619	Congrats.
5904159	5904299	Yep.
5904779	5905819	Alright, let's see.
5905879	5908580	TigerClaw links us to a few stories here.
5908960	5911580	Valve is starting to look at Steam Mobile.
5911820	5912661	Oh, that would be kind of neat.
5912741	5914581	Like a mobile-based Steam store.
5915481	5918262	I'm assuming that can't really compete with the iPhone.
5918582	5919522	Well, I mean, excuse me.
5919662	5922922	It would compete with the iPhone, but it can't be on the iPhone, I suppose.
5923422	5924123	Or maybe it could.
5924623	5930284	I guess you could always do something like that because if you sold it through the Apple store and then it could have the add-ons.
5930384	5930684	I don't know.
5930744	5931944	But I don't know if that's what Valve would do.
5932604	5956120	Anyway, Valve is saying that they're looking at the possibility of bringing Steam to mobile devices According to the story, it's from TradeMagMCV And I guess it's something that the Valve Marketing Vice President, Doug Lombardi Says that the more requests that Valve receives for a mobile version of the platform The more likely it is to act Hmm, we'll see what happens with that At least you know you get some hella good sales on that
5959135	5965358	TigerClaw305, Smithsonian Announces Lineup for Art of Video Games Exhibit
5978643	5983387	Which is funny because remember that whole video games aren't art debate that went on a couple years ago?
5983647	5985769	Well, now they're going to show video game art in the Smithsonian.
5985829	5987530	So, I don't know.
5987590	5988931	I think that kind of ends that argument.
5989592	5991834	By the way, there's a quote here that sells the exhibition.
5992254	5992494	Quote,
6003743	6004203	Thank you for watching!
6022128	6033535	There will also be video interviews with notable game developers, large prints of screenshots, antique consoles, 3.7 million votes cast in a poll over 175 countries.
6033935	6039799	There's 80 games in the exhibit, including Zelda, Donkey Kong, Doom 2, but there are some missing.
6040319	6043041	This article calls out Space Harrier and Beyond Good and Evil.
6043361	6044002	But you know what?
6044022	6049465	When there's only 80 games, sadly some good ones are probably going to be lost by the wayside.
6050816	6052337	All right, a few more tweets for you guys here.
6053338	6056140	JV Mon tweets us about Thomas Howard.
6056160	6059583	Remember Thomas Howard Lichtenstein, I think his name is, of DDR fame?
6059963	6060363	Remember that?
6061084	6064026	Apparently, it's a song with Disco Warp.
6064387	6070171	They were in DDR Universe, and this is some type of indie band collaboration here.
6070672	6072213	I guess they're all straight out of Portland.
6072733	6073534	So here's the song.
6089525	6090125	Oh my gosh.
6090666	6092587	There's too much noise in that song.
6092847	6094007	There's just too much noise.
6094027	6096268	I'm just picturing a lot of 13-year-olds at a rave now.
6096288	6097989	So where's Thomas Howard coming to that?
6098209	6101491	I imagine he sings at some point, but I don't know if I can get to that point.
6101511	6103172	I'm not saying his song is bad, but I'm just saying.
6103192	6104333	Fast forward it.
6104353	6105713	Maybe the middle is a little bit different.
6106374	6107314	Oh, is it the wrong song?
6108255	6109815	Oh, JV Mon said I played the wrong song.
6111616	6112036	My bad.
6112617	6114358	Well, I clicked the link you sent me.
6114378	6115838	All right, here we go.
6115898	6116899	Let's try this one instead.
6130407	6131549	Why do they do that?
6131809	6133272	Okay, too many effects.
6133913	6134475	You don't need it.
6147110	6150994	Jack's Beef Jerky is running promos for Xbox Live Arcade and Hulu Plus.
6151014	6154577	I got three months gold for $12.95 and a month of Hulu Plus for free.
6154697	6155138	Any thoughts?
6168670	6176377	Okay, first off, Hulu Plus is, it sucks because you're paying to watch commercials, and I don't like that at all.
6176697	6181161	I mean, yes, they have a big archive of shows, but, you know, so does Netflix.
6181842	6184704	And I think there's plenty of stuff to watch on there, and the internet.
6185445	6189328	Also, the other thing to keep in mind, the Hulu Plus interface on Xbox fucking blows.
6189749	6193612	Because they've done that whole crossbar thing with Hulu Plus, and it doesn't work.
6193988	6221700	the crossbar thing does not work for everything and Hulu Plus and Facebook and Twitter and all this other stuff they try to integrate into Xbox that crossbar thing does not work for it so yeah I guess you can set up a queue online to do Hulu Plus and that's kind of I guess the way you're supposed to do it but did you know that a lot of the stuff you can watch on the web you can't watch on your Xbox it's not licensed for playback on the Xbox more reason why Hulu Plus is kind of dumb sorry
6224968	6232939	or you can set up your queue and then download Tversity.
6233500	6240289	You can download, I'm sure, a streaming program and link it with that and you can actually stream all that stuff through there.
6241550	6246951	Some comments in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Blackwolf says, you have to give your credit card to get the free month.
6247091	6248092	Uh-oh.
6248172	6252173	Breakman says, I like Hulu Plus' TV selection, but the movie selection sucks.
6253013	6259854	Salacious Pop clarifies, the biggest draw to Hulu Plus is that they let you watch shows on demand that are still current from just last week, etc.
6260154	6262035	You know how else you can watch shows that are still current?
6262355	6262715	Torrents.
6264085	6292387	or most of them are on like CBS.com most of the CBS shows most of them are available that way but like the real real stuff like HBO if you want to watch I don't know what the Tudors or any of that Showtime we just got HBO actually because we upgraded our Comcast whatever because they're going to give us the same thing plus our phone for the same price we had already I wanted to see the Gaga concert last night that's the thing though they gave us HBO
6293496	6295157	But it doesn't work.
6296639	6298400	Because we were like, okay, what should we watch?
6298460	6299441	Oh, concert, okay.
6300062	6301343	We don't have anything else to watch.
6301823	6302524	So we clicked on that.
6303124	6304005	This channel's not available.
6305506	6308469	But they were supposed to give it to us free for three months.
6308849	6311531	So great, there's something else that's wrong with Comcast.
6311872	6312272	Hooray.
6312792	6314034	But hey, we have a DVR now, so that's all good.
6314054	6317577	Blackwolf in our chatroom says, or you could watch it on the TV.
6319309	6322670	If you want to watch a current show, you can turn on your TV and watch it.
6323290	6323931	That's a good point.
6324271	6326071	We caught up on The Office last night.
6326251	6327592	I watch Survivor live every week.
6327652	6328652	I don't have a DVR anymore.
6328992	6329733	I don't record shows.
6329773	6337975	So if I don't watch it live, I'm either watching it on CBS.com or Netflix or Hulu.com, the free version, or something.
6338856	6339636	Torrents are great.
6340196	6348939	Or if you want to get into this century with the piracy, Usenet or the file share sites are way better and faster.
6349383	6371837	by the way I think I should be on Survivor because like seriously this season is driving me bonkers because there's all these bimbos on that show that are totally being controlled right now I can't stand it I'm just saying if I went on that show I'd be the one in charge bitches better watch it that's right watch it that's it for tweets twitter.com slash OLR
6373597	6375278	Let's move on to some more news.
6375378	6378561	Listless coming up in just a moment, but first, a round of stories.
6379401	6380462	Yeah.
6380542	6385825	So Konami's planning this sort of party, or I don't know.
6387046	6392590	They're doing a pre-E3 show on June 2nd, I guess, a few days before E3 starts.
6393050	6394751	The event will be streamed online.
6394831	6396152	They haven't said which sites yet.
6396993	6398253	And there's going to be, I guess...
6400815	6415120	Like a sitting room where people can watch trailers for stuff and they're also going to have like parties in LA, San Francisco, Toronto, Sao Paulo and Mexico City and other cities.
6415680	6422943	They haven't really finalized this list of cities yet and apparently they're going to be inviting the press and stuff like that to these things.
6424443	6425084	Oh, I guess.
6425124	6426405	We need no fucking invite.
6428428	6436477	And, you know, I can understand that, you know, whole LA thing, because that's fucking far, and they're not going to pay for us to fly in there.
6436497	6439541	But San Francisco, man, that's like an hour or two away.
6440502	6440642	And
6442827	6443107	Whatever.
6443588	6443908	You know what?
6443948	6447952	I don't give a shit about your fucking Yu-Gi-Oh game that you have there.
6449033	6449314	So yeah.
6449714	6458002	And then I think also on their Facebook and stuff, they were doing this contest where like, be the ultimate Konami fan and tell us why you are the ultimate Konami fan.
6458042	6462567	You can win like an iPad or, you know, a trip to E3 or some crap like that.
6465489	6475713	More on that, I'm sure, as we get closer to those dates, because obviously they haven't really announced too much other than, hey, we're going to be doing our first annual pre-E3 show.
6479715	6481896	Maybe we can make a drinking game out of that, too.
6481976	6482496	That would be fun.
6484237	6484717	We could.
6484737	6486578	I mean, obviously they're going to be showing what...
6488777	6494158	The Melgar Solid Rising game, which still hasn't come out.
6494298	6496538	So that's probably one of the big things.
6496939	6499459	Silent Hill Downpour, that'll be another big one.
6503120	6504260	That's pretty much it.
6504660	6507300	I mean, I guess they're bringing No More Heroes over here.
6507340	6509221	They're localizing that for the PS3.
6510841	6511701	So they'll show that.
6514662	6514942	But...
6517040	6517400	and DarkSakura.
6545160	6547081	That's the hip thing to do in Hollywood these days.
6547101	6548201	Exactly, rebooting it.
6548481	6550762	I don't think it's that far off.
6550882	6555904	Obviously, it's going to be a hell of a lot of work, and I need to do that right now.
6556104	6557925	But first, you've got to get somebody's ear.
6557985	6559325	Good luck with that.
6559385	6564567	No, not actually, because do the pitch first, then get the person's ear.
6564667	6569689	Or copyright your idea first, and then... That's how you do it.
6570530	6571330	Do it the smart way.
6572370	6573931	Yeah, just because, I mean, come on.
6573971	6574191	I mean...
6575658	6581241	I actually did the math, and this is great, and might as well bring this up since we're talking about it.
6581361	6588385	And just to kind of show you real quick, or demonstrate how the franchise has fallen.
6588886	6590527	For example, I did the numbers.
6591247	6595770	According to the NPD reports, January 2011, this would be everything from 2010 and back.
6595790	6595850	Um...
6599815	6604339	Hotest Party 2 Hotest Party 3 Hotest Party 4 Hotest Party 5
6621074	6626598	2010, Dance Dance Revolution, remember their kind of reboot thing, 170,000 units.
6627198	6630000	And then on the PlayStation 3, Dance Dance Revolution, 60,000.
6630601	6633443	Compare that to, oh, and Dance Master is only 47,000 units.
6633563	6633783	Oh, wow.
6641289	6642610	Just Dance 2, 3.5 million units sold!
6661644	6663504	They're just not putting a lot of effort into it anymore.
6663864	6666885	Breakman in our chatroom asks, What the F is Hottest Party?
6666945	6668325	Is that one of those AO games?
6668725	6670786	Now that would be an awesome way to reboot the series.
6670826	6672746	Don't you agree?
6672826	6678247	DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I didn't even know DDR kept getting releases until someone gave me the Step Mania files.
6678287	6679247	Maybe that's part of the problem.
6679847	6683608	The community's been kind of, like if you go to DDR Freak, you'll see the tumbleweed rolling by.
6683648	6686008	I mean, there's not nearly the community there used to be.
6686028	6688489	But I don't think they really need necessarily the community for it.
6688649	6690989	There's not a big community for Just Dance.
6692506	6692786	True.
6693427	6695768	I mean, it's all about being current.
6695808	6700731	And I think what the problem's been is they've been trying to innovate with the series, and they just don't know how.
6700991	6704974	They don't really know which direction to take it in, so they're taking it in all the directions at the same time.
6705514	6713599	You know, they're like, okay, we're going to innovate by adding eight-panel dance mode or something like that.
6714139	6715560	No, that's not what you do.
6716301	6718462	They're trying to shove square pegs into the round hole.
6718562	6719143	Exactly.
6719883	6720543	That's the problem.
6720824	6721424	And I think...
6723256	6724498	I have some good ideas.
6724778	6729282	It's hard to describe them over the radio because it's all in my head right now.
6729662	6734767	And I've tried to sit down and type out what I'm thinking.
6735347	6739992	But if I can get what's in my head on paper, it's going to be awesome.
6740472	6741233	That's the problem.
6742594	6744315	But I have some fresh ideas for it.
6744335	6748339	So see if I don't get bored of this whole idea and actually...
6749500	6752528	Finish it and be able to pitch it.
6752568	6753270	It would be awesome.
6753410	6756277	But yeah, once again, they're not going to give a shit if they're just...
6759116	6760777	You know, if they don't want to try, then that's fine.
6760857	6768340	Some folks in the chatroom are commenting that folks moved on to other websites, like BomaniStyle and so forth, but those websites are not just about DDR.
6768760	6772021	And usually, DDR seems to not be the focus at all.
6772061	6772641	You know what I mean?
6772741	6774222	That's why DDR is continuing to plummet.
6774682	6775823	Other games might be doing okay.
6775923	6779804	Like, DJ Max Portable got released in the US because of the following it has here.
6780204	6782525	But, you know, DDR is a different game.
6782585	6783646	The thing is, though, it's...
6785007	6813195	Dance Dance Revolution was kind of like the innovator it brought people to the genre first and then now they have these other games out there and they're doing really well and that's not to say that Dance Dance Revolution can't do that well even if it did half as well it would still be way better than what it is now and so that's the thing all they have to do is figure out how to capture that audience and I think I know how to do that just based off of what they've done and what hasn't worked
6813815	6828332	and what has worked and you just kind of combine all they have all the pieces there it's just they're not doing it right well I want to know I hope you get your audience with Konami someday alright let's move on buy stock a couple more stories for you guys yeah buy stock I actually thought about buying stock in Sony
6828972	6832693	Just so I could sign a petition to shake up the management, but we'll see.
6833113	6833333	All right.
6834213	6837474	Anyhow, quick, quick story about Quake and Wolfenstein.
6837514	6842956	Yes, some old, old properties that are, you know, very near and dear in a lot of first-person shooter fans' hearts.
6843816	6850938	An interesting comment from senior producer Jason Kim when Shaq News spoke with id Software.
6850958	6851878	I call him ID Software.
6851898	6852818	Somebody call him id Software.
6853058	6853278	Quote,
6872913	6900695	I think we can freshen those things up we don't have anything in the works right now but I think when we start talking about different things we can do with the other properties that we have I hope people are receptive to what we want to do and what we think would be fun for players to experience coming out of id Software well I mean there was a new Wolfenstein game not that long ago and it wasn't very remarkable and then there was a Quake Arena on Xbox Live is pretty cool but the Quake 4 was not cool actually it was not that great because that was on Xbox 360 right yeah it wasn't very good
6901215	6902597	So, uh, yeah.
6902997	6903398	We'll see.
6903498	6906621	I mean, I'm all for going back to the drawing board with new ideas.
6906881	6908283	Those are two big properties.
6908343	6909825	I used to love Quake back in the day.
6910305	6912567	And Quake 3 and Quake Arena are actually a lot of fun.
6912608	6913869	Did you ever play Ascii Quake?
6915130	6916472	No, I never played Ascii Quake.
6917433	6919135	But, I remember the old Quake CD.
6919175	6920096	Oh, it's Gotcha Quake.
6920516	6920977	Gotcha Doom.
6922421	6949790	people have a lot of free time on their hands what can I say alright so speaking of a lot of free time on our hands a little segment we like to do on this show once in a while is a segment where we try to come up with the definitive list on a topic that's right after we're done tonight we are going to go through a list and find out the exact top three scientifically proven answers to a topic it's a process we call list lists
6953134	6956438	The way listless works, since we haven't played this in a little while.
6957159	6963387	We're going to give you a topic, and the topic tonight is Thing PlayStation Network Needs When It Comes Back to Make Me Care About It Again.
6964033	6991298	and then the four of us yes we're going to get someone online in just a moment the four of us will go around the room and each give our top three answers as to what should be on that list that will leave us with a list of twelve then the hard part oh this is the hard part but you know reality shows are all about voting things off so we each go around and take one thing off the list that leaves us with a list of eight that you the chatters get to vote on and you vote for your top three and that's it that's the list
6991974	6993115	That's the answers right there.
6993375	6999059	Tonight's topic, thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again.
6999359	7002201	You can give your answers in our chatroom at chat.orangelongeradio.com.
7002241	7008806	I can't guarantee we'll use them, but when one of our hosts is struggling to find an answer or if something gets duplicated, we'll usually turn to the chatroom.
7009266	7011588	All right, let's bring in our fourth person here.
7011628	7015851	I'm going to go ahead and give him a call.
7015871	7019253	Let me dip the music down here for just a minute so we can call on the Skype line.
7019273	7020174	I've got somebody set up here.
7020950	7021570	Hello.
7021951	7023031	Hi, is this Tiara?
7023671	7024292	Yes, it is.
7024372	7026713	It's the one and only Tiara, a.k.a.
7026813	7028694	Maren Marvel, joining us tonight.
7028794	7034957	You might have heard the commercial for Pop Culture Parlay in between the segments tonight if you were listening live.
7035597	7040480	Tell us real quick about your projects, Maren Marvel, before you play with us tonight.
7041246	7066467	Well as you know I steal Jamie about once a week and we do Comic Insanity which is a comics and kind of like a geek culture podcast where we talk about fun stuff and then there's Pop Culture Parlay which is just kind of a little bit of craziness where Weasel aka Jonathan Long who works for EA and myself kind of talk about different pop culture stuff like we've done like
7067087	7095248	Star Wars vs. Star Trek we've talked about the best Batman we've talked about all sorts of random stuff so it's it's just really really fun really really good time and that's on geek-life.com awesome well best of luck with all those projects you know I like to sometimes poke fun at the stuff you and DarkSakura do as the Giggling Girls show but actually you guys do very hard work so best of luck alright you ready to play listless with us tonight I sure am yay then I can play music again alright
7096209	7097329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7119901	7120522	Mind Control via Nanobots
7136332	7137993	Mind control via nanobots.
7138013	7139355	How would that work with a playstation?
7139375	7142097	By the way, your answers can be as serious or as silly as you want.
7142357	7151424	Because I have a first model PS3, so clearly it has the hardware inside of it to create nanobots based off of data sent in through the PSN once it comes back up.
7151584	7153266	And what would be the first thing you'd mind control?
7153886	7155306	No, it would mind control me to care.
7155967	7157107	Oh, okay, I see, I see.
7157187	7158908	Yeah, it would mind control me to care.
7159148	7159988	Okay, there you go.
7160668	7162769	Alright, Mar and Marvel, we'll go to you.
7163229	7166430	What's your number three answer thing that PlayStation could do to get you to care?
7167250	7178674	Well, since there's all this talk about how, you know, our data has been, like, stolen, maybe they could give us, like, a year of free credit reporting so that we can keep an eye on our credit.
7179369	7186135	and make sure that those people that are stealing our information aren't buying things from Nigerians and stuff.
7186175	7192300	To be fair, they sort of did, but I think you're talking about something a little more intense than what this whole Debix thing is about.
7192360	7196784	Debix is credit monitoring, but not credit reporting, so there is a difference.
7197204	7197324	Yes.
7197364	7197905	All right.
7198405	7202587	Alright, just wanted to clarify the difference for our listeners because you know how internet people will be.
7202648	7206850	They'll say, Dear Orange Lounge Radio, your guest was uninformed.
7207010	7208611	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
7208671	7211793	My number three answer, thing that PlayStation Network could do.
7212753	7217216	How about a PlayStation 2 emulator download for my collection?
7218156	7220478	They've been rumored to work on one of those for years.
7221418	7222679	I'd like to see that come out.
7222699	7224180	So PlayStation 2 emulator.
7224500	7226061	I don't care how they have to get it to work.
7226101	7227442	Just get it to work if you want me to care.
7229966	7232167	Up in the cap of members allowed in the PlayStation Home Clubs.
7250656	7251557	I like to say a billion.
7251577	7252337	That would be perfect.
7252377	7253699	That is a practical answer.
7253739	7254199	I love that.
7254219	7258603	Because right now in the Orange Lounge Radio Club, I'm allowed to have 25 people.
7258623	7260605	25 people does not include me.
7260625	7261866	I don't want to sound cocky.
7262347	7266291	We have a little more than 25 people that listen to this program that have a PlayStation 3.
7267171	7270575	So I would really like to be able to invite more people.
7270835	7273557	Because unfortunately, we've got a list of about... I shit you not...
7274258	7276339	More than 25 waiting.
7276480	7279482	I can't do anything with them because I'm limited.
7279802	7283224	Of course, I don't know what we would do in the PlayStation Home Club.
7283424	7285265	I just want to have a big club.
7287367	7289568	Let's go to DarkSakura.
7289608	7291650	Your number two answer for the list.
7291670	7293511	Thing PlayStation Network could do to get you to care.
7293951	7295692	Morph the system into a Dreamcast 2.
7297994	7301236	My husband left in the other room.
7301641	7303262	So it would just instantly transform.
7304083	7305323	And it's a Dreamcast 2.
7306564	7307144	Outstanding.
7307164	7310346	With a big Sega logo flipping off PlayStation.
7310466	7311647	Via a firmware update.
7311967	7312748	Via a firmware update.
7312828	7315810	Alright, MarnMarvel, your number 2 answer.
7317391	7322334	I would like a new attachment for the PS3 that serves frozen yogurt.
7327799	7330880	It doesn't have to be Pinkberry, you know, I'm not a snob here.
7330960	7333461	You're not asking for the world, just frozen yogurt.
7333481	7334801	Alright, I like that.
7335081	7337382	A new attachment that will serve frozen yogurt.
7337402	7338162	I like that answer.
7338782	7344284	Alright, let's see, my number two answer for a thing that they could do to get me to care about PlayStation Network.
7345404	7349065	Guardian Legend 2 released as a PlayStation Network exclusive.
7350708	7357956	Of course the greatest, most underrated 8-bit game of all time, Guardian Legend 2 would have to come out as a PSN exclusive.
7359622	7360042	That was weak.
7360102	7361423	I see what you did there.
7361483	7362423	Good one.
7362923	7364564	Loki, your number two answer.
7364584	7368605	Once again, I'd like to reiterate, I really don't care.
7381729	7383270	Thanks for watching!
7402435	7403455	See, I never understood that.
7403495	7408899	Let's just get rid of the whole Linux support instead of, I don't know, patching it so that it doesn't allow people to hack us.
7409199	7419426	You know, I can't for the life of me believe that amongst all this talk of frozen yogurt and mind control, Loki is the voice of reason tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7420267	7421267	I don't care.
7421327	7422708	Am I in Bizarro World?
7422968	7424790	I don't want anything from them.
7425130	7425950	What do I want?
7426251	7428732	It's like a blowjob.
7428792	7429733	That's what you want.
7430053	7430393	No, I...
7433755	7435336	Sony Blowjob, really?
7437417	7439898	That would be unsatisfying, I can tell you that much.
7443620	7447402	Alright, here's the list as it is so far.
7447462	7449683	We disabled the good feature, you know.
7451264	7452605	We disabled the humming feature.
7453045	7454626	Mind Control via Nanobots.
7456417	7458218	We disabled the feature that will swallow.
7458278	7480131	Alright now, Mind Control via Nanobots, Give us a year of free credit reporting, PlayStation 2 emulator downloading, upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs, morph the system into a Dreamcast 2, new attachment that serves frozen yogurt, Guardian Legend 2 PlayStation Network exclusive, and bring back the other OS feature.
7480611	7482573	Alright, let's go around and get the number one answers!
7483493	7484794	from the folks here in studio.
7485054	7487056	DarkSakura, number one thing that could bring you back.
7487336	7488177	A year of Pinkberry.
7491820	7492801	A year of Pinkberry.
7492841	7499686	Would this actually come out of the PlayStation 3 like Marvel suggested or would this be just a coupon redeemable at your local store?
7499806	7506151	It would be like a card that's got like 365 charges on it for Pinkberry.
7506271	7506732	I see.
7506792	7509114	Because I like going to Pinkberry and listening to the music.
7509134	7509774	All right.
7510335	7511876	Mar and Marvel, your number three answer.
7513035	7520580	How about some free download content for people who, for like, you know, co-op games and games that you play online.
7520640	7527464	So since people have missed all that kind of stuff during this whole debacle, they can get some free download content and make up for not shooting things.
7528625	7530306	I'm sorry, of course that's the number one answer.
7530626	7534049	I just shortened that to free download content of good games.
7535069	7535289	Yes.
7537191	7539072	As opposed to like, you know, Undertow.
7539922	7560016	Free download content of good games My number one answer to the question By the way, I have to read this comment from Salacious Pop A Sony blowjob is $30 more expensive from a similar competent brand and the no toothy head feature has to be ordered from a neighboring store and costs even more
7562233	7568256	My number one answer for a thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again.
7568576	7569557	Drumroll, please.
7571858	7573118	Gay pornography.
7573498	7575079	Yay!
7576300	7578981	Which is even more funny than straight pornography.
7579688	7581489	Alright, that was my number one answer.
7581569	7583609	Gay pornography would get me to care.
7584030	7590912	Selling gay porn on the end... Okay, so all you straight guys at home, they're going, eh, fine.
7591152	7592753	Lesbian porn, galore.
7593293	7596534	Lesbos R Us is what the PlayStation Store renames itself to.
7596614	7596954	Enjoy.
7597814	7598174	Alright.
7600575	7604457	Loki, your number one answer for the thing PlayStation Network could do to get you back.
7606377	7607898	Just don't give a fuck about it.
7608258	7608378	Um...
7612412	7619881	You know, this doesn't even have to be free, and it's not even necessarily something that they give to me, but it'd be kind of cool if they put out a new AIBO, I guess.
7620602	7621323	I mean, I don't know.
7623045	7623766	Really, Loki?
7624747	7625227	Why not?
7625568	7627771	Okay, everybody, point and laugh at Loki.
7630814	7631374	I don't know.
7631414	7635076	I just, like, I don't care that their network's down because they never used it.
7635096	7639097	So the thing you want most in the world, Loki, is a new eyeball.
7640398	7641018	Not really.
7641378	7644560	Actually, I would like... No, scratch that.
7644960	7645800	Screw the eyeball thing.
7646521	7647401	Alright, alright.
7647641	7648021	Okay.
7648301	7650282	Thing I would like most from Sony.
7651042	7651963	Thing from Sony.
7654062	7658563	They have really no power to do this, but I would like the Clerks animated series back on air.
7659124	7661624	So maybe they could make that happen.
7661644	7662385	That would be awesome.
7663985	7667086	Alright, so get the Clerks animated series back on air.
7667306	7668766	Alright, much better answer.
7669687	7671567	Alright, so let's recap the list.
7671607	7673128	Here comes the hard part, you guys.
7673688	7675468	We gotta take one off the list.
7675508	7676729	I'm sorry, it's just the way it works.
7676809	7676969	It's a
7677597	7678879	It's tough love, folks.
7678919	7679520	It's tough love.
7679820	7681462	Here's the list as it stands so far.
7681863	7683345	Mind Control via Nanobots.
7683745	7685428	Give us a year of free credit reporting.
7685828	7687751	PlayStation 2 emulator downloading.
7688171	7690634	Upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs.
7691015	7692677	Morph the system into a Dreamcast 2.
7695194	7703841	New attachment that serves frozen yogurt Guardian Legend 2 PSN exclusive Bring back the other OS feature Did I cut out for a minute?
7703861	7714970	Sorry Bring back the other OS feature A year of Pinkberry Free download content of good games Gay pornography And Clerks animated series back on air
7715871	7718154	These are all things that could actually happen.
7718355	7722140	I like how SSJ100Matt says, won't happen, Disney has the rights to it.
7722340	7724824	Who said this is realistic at all?
7724964	7727828	SSJ100Matt, this is what we want.
7728389	7730452	I don't give a shit that Disney owns it.
7730572	7731273	Make it happen.
7732765	7734746	By the way, let's read some of the comments from chat here.
7735886	7736946	Let's see, what were some of the stuff?
7737487	7742288	Breakman says, Kazurai kills a puppy anytime someone mentions free games on his network.
7742308	7743048	That's not an answer.
7743089	7744109	We wouldn't want to kill puppies.
7744149	7745369	That's not going to get us to do anything.
7746210	7748810	Bonds006 agrees, make PS3 backward compatible.
7750051	7752832	SJ100Matt, make President Cat playable for the move.
7754472	7757113	DarkTetsuya says, make PlayStation Network out of bacon.
7758254	7758354	Uh...
7759554	7765378	Lots of good answers there in chat, but unfortunately we've got to go through the list and figure out what is not worthy of the list.
7765698	7770441	So DarkSakura, which of these items is not worthy of the list?
7775025	7775645	It's going to be tough.
7780589	7806413	bring back the other OS because I don't give a shit she's striking what is probably the most logical answer on the entire list bring back the other OS feature it has been stricken from the list alright, Mar and Marvel hopefully you have the list in your mind you know what you want to take off which one of these is not worthy of the list well personally I don't want my brain controlled by nanobots so I'm going to have to go with that one
7806789	7809930	The attachment that serves frozen yogurt could serve Pinkberry, I'm just saying.
7829946	7831327	The PS3 is too hot.
7831467	7832768	It's a George Foreman grill.
7833928	7835289	So it has been removed from the list.
7835729	7836770	Sorry, Mario Marvel.
7836790	7839531	All right, Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7841212	7842333	That's a lot.
7844054	7844814	No offense.
7848136	7858402	I'm going to have to say... So wrong, but... Yeah, I'm going to have to say free download content of good games because there's no such thing.
7858462	7858602	Oh.
7862245	7865107	It's just, come on, that's a cheap way of free download content.
7865247	7866068	Here's a dollar!
7867168	7867689	Screw that.
7867729	7871451	Alright, so here is the list as it is right now.
7871871	7873712	Give us a year of free credit reporting.
7874012	7875293	PlayStation 2 emulator downloading.
7875313	7876314	Oh, I should have done that one.
7876634	7879116	Upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs.
7879536	7881357	Morph the system into a Dreamcast 2.
7883294	7891397	GuardianLegend2 PlayStation Network Exclusive, A Year of Pinkberry, Gay Pornography, and Clerks Animated Series Back on Air.
7891457	7893118	How did gay pornography survive?
7893498	7895118	Well, I don't know, but it's your turn to vote.
7895459	7896799	There's the list in the chatroom.
7897059	7901881	Send a private message to Sky with your vote with your number one and number two most wanted answer.
7902181	7904862	Please label your one and two choices as one is worth more.
7905242	7906043	So there you go.
7906323	7907083	Send a private message.
7907123	7911545	We'll tally them all up, and we'll let you know the winners right after the mailbag.
7911665	7912005	Woot!
7912905	7915688	Mara Marvel, though, as for now, we are going to go ahead and say goodbye.
7915948	7917450	But thank you so much for playing with us tonight.
7918050	7918651	No problem.
7918691	7921314	I'm sorry half your list got eliminated, but that's what happens sometimes.
7921934	7922755	Yeah, it's all right.
7923076	7926219	You still did a great job and best of luck, of course, with your other projects.
7926755	7927456	Thank you very much.
7956757	7957838	Ah, fun stuff.
7958478	7970306	Um, so, rumors, we gotta get into more rumors, of course, you know, everybody's, Jones in the sea, what the hell exactly is gonna be, uh, part of the new Wii system?
7971587	7977290	And, uh, there's a lot of speculation out there, a lot of unnamed sources and whatnot, so take this with a big grain of salt, but, um...
7980003	7981224	Apparently, here's some of the rumors.
7981904	7985147	They're saying that it's only going to have 8GB of storage on board.
7985187	7988409	Kind of think of it like the flash-based storage that they had already.
7989530	7992512	They're saying it's going to be augmented, though, by SD card support.
7992552	7995014	So kind of think of it like the Wii was, just a little bit bigger.
7995074	8000858	And 8GB, compare that to, say, the Microsoft Xbox, the new system.
8002559	8005161	That has 4GB built into some of them.
8005521	8007062	So that's not too bad.
8007502	8012166	They're saying that the storage space is going to be on the actual disks.
8012646	8016369	It's going to be using some 25 gigabyte disks.
8016389	8018830	They're saying maybe a single layer Blu-ray disk.
8021132	8025275	Although they're not really saying what type of disk format they're using.
8025855	8053438	also that the 1080p output is not necessarily a definite it might be lower than that 720 or something honestly though if they're going to be pushing visuals that are better than Sony and Microsoft they really do need to do 1080p I think at the very least although they're saying that it might be 1080i come on don't skimp on this shit that's all I gotta say
8056161	8059022	But, of course, we're not going to really know until the damn system comes out.
8059062	8061203	So, let's not wait.
8061563	8062784	Alright, you just have to wait and see.
8062904	8063664	Wait one more month.
8064184	8064564	Exactly.
8065225	8067566	And then, I don't know.
8069006	8069706	It'll be interesting.
8069987	8079190	I have a feeling when I think of Nintendo announcing the system during their press conference, the only word that comes to my mind is disappointment.
8079871	8083112	So, I'm expecting disappointment.
8084072	8086993	All right, well, there is some good news, I guess, to talk about.
8087094	8089335	It does have to do with World of Warcraft, but this is good news.
8089395	8102800	They have released in the World of Warcraft store, their little, I know you all love this word, but microtransaction store they've got going on, between now and July 31st, if you buy their latest in-game pet, which is the Cenarion Hatchling.
8102961	8103861	It's so cute.
8103921	8108323	I believe it's based off an old, old mount that was available at one time, but now it's a little pet.
8108743	8119552	And if you buy this mount, or I'm sorry, excuse me, this pet for $10, 100% of that $10 will be donated to the Red Cross's Japan earthquake and Pacific tsunami relief effort.
8120232	8127178	There was a big call for Blizzard to do something like this because obviously, you know, they've sold mounts and things like that strictly for profit before.
8127498	8130740	They've also done sales where half the profits go to something.
8130760	8138366	And I believe they recently said they sold the Moonkin Hatchling Pet not that long ago and they gave half the proceeds to make a Wish Foundation.
8138766	8139546	And I believe it raised $800,000.
8140187	8146431	So imagine what 100% of the proceeds you're going to raise for this very needed cause.
8146471	8147512	I mean, even now.
8147592	8153756	I realize you're not seeing it every day in the news, but that doesn't mean it was cleaned up overnight and everybody is suddenly all better.
8154136	8155017	That's not how this works.
8155337	8155557	So...
8156698	8157018	DarkSakura.com
8186791	8204446	just for the record I'm not reading anything related to PlayStation Network make that disclaimer ahead of time hey guys it's Blade 3 I just wanted to say thanks for everything again and if you could reprimands I guess reprimand or completely extricated video game or company e.g.
8204947	8212974	EA or Ubisoft or Squeenix and why you would do that okay wait wait which company would we reprimand out of them?
8214338	8218501	And if you could... I'm not getting the context on here.
8220563	8222064	What are we reprimanding them for?
8222084	8222684	I don't know.
8222704	8223945	You've been very naughty.
8224946	8225667	I have no idea.
8226167	8227128	We do that all the time anyway.
8227748	8228369	Thanks again, guys.
8228389	8229329	Keep up the fantastic work.
8229369	8230050	And Loki, you rock.
8230070	8230650	Peace, guys.
8230710	8232952	This message is brought to you by Make Employees I Work With.
8233012	8234073	Make rocks look like Einstein.
8235774	8237876	We would reprimand them all when they deserve it.
8238276	8239117	That's how these things work.
8240188	8242870	Hey OLR or OLF, Orange Lunch Foodio.
8243770	8247072	Long time no type, I wanted to show you a picture of a Navajo taco.
8247092	8248633	They're sometimes called Indian tacos.
8249874	8250534	Is there a picture?
8251135	8253396	Oh, this is a follow-up to the email from last week.
8253576	8255858	This image has been removed for security reasons?
8260191	8262993	owned by the security filter.
8264094	8264854	Taco!
8264974	8265715	Hold on, hold on.
8265735	8267276	There's an easy solution to this.
8267376	8267676	Watch.
8267756	8268677	Find your taco.
8268737	8277763	I'm going to go to google.com and I'm going to click on images and then I'm going to type Navajo taco.
8278364	8280265	I'm going to hit enter and there it is.
8280465	8280845	Oh, yum.
8280925	8284228	It's like a, oh, this is like a Mexican pizza type of thing.
8284608	8285929	Let me finish reading this.
8286109	8288950	Then you think of that Taco Bell entree, which is not the same.
8289410	8290130	Okay, I get it.
8316039	8318400	Sometimes you can fold them and eat them like an actual taco.
8318520	8320462	Some people use a fork and knife if they're too big.
8320962	8322263	I usually eat them like a pizza.
8322443	8324624	Oh, Rob, your comparison was astute.
8325444	8328226	When I introduce someone to a Navajo taco, they fall in love.
8328386	8334329	If you want to try one, I suggest checking out the next powwow that might be in your area.
8334709	8335310	You know what?
8335430	8337671	Now that you mention it, I have had one before.
8339652	8343034	I had one in Alabama at the Creek Indian Powwow.
8343374	8344815	But that's not what they were called.
8347610	8349651	You can find people making these tacos there most of the time.
8349711	8351352	Don't get them from any carnival or fairs.
8351372	8353173	They're not usually the best tasting there.
8353633	8354594	That's all I wanted to share.
8354634	8355915	I'll let you guys get back to gaming.
8355935	8356555	Happy eating.
8356855	8359977	AJ Twist of Unfocused Podcast.
8363680	8364600	Well, thank you for the email.
8365561	8367002	And that Navajo taco did look yummy.
8368102	8370244	I really, really freaking want a taco, Rob.
8372465	8372825	All right.
8373426	8373626	Okay.
8376874	8379775	I disagree with some of the choices, which are moot points.
8379795	8383036	The one I think is obviously a wrong pick is Pac-Man for the Atari 2600.
8383076	8388118	I have a big critique about the lack of advanced techniques for graphics and the overly short development cycle for that game.
8401164	8409392	Seriously, I hope that they show the progression of detail shifting from highly stylized artwork like on Adventure or Haunted House to in-game art.
8410212	8419981	I always kind of wish that they'd make a new Space Invaders with the Yeti-like aliens throwing lightning bolts from the side of the arcade cabinet.
8420442	8424005	I also hope they show the graphic art design on different publishers' game boxes.
8424165	8425666	I will definitely go see the exhibit.
8426447	8426787	Pictures.
8429609	8430290	Don't care.
8431630	8432611	Sony's getting sued.
8434852	8435232	Of course.
8436673	8440436	Like I said, I'm not reading anything about the PlayStation.
8440496	8443157	Ho and Spazinator sends a follow-up email.
8444098	8449121	That's the one that... The one on Monday he said not to read.
8449181	8449701	Disregard it.
8450060	8450300	Okay.
8451181	8452242	I just had everything pulled up.
8452422	8453723	Okay.
8455985	8456926	More about PlayStation.
8456966	8457626	Sorry, Rababa.
8458147	8460869	Last email to Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
8460929	8463451	Have you ever bought a game just for the sake of having it?
8463571	8469536	I mean, yeah, you bought the game to play it, but you bought it more for the fact of having it for your collection than to actually play it.
8469976	8470276	Thanks.
8470356	8471217	Peace out, Ranma.
8471557	8472398	Good question.
8472478	8473459	I have all the time.
8474259	8478343	I got Dan Gunstar Heroes on Game Gear, and I don't think he's opened it yet.
8481264	8484808	I got a Forgotten Realms D&D game because it came with a gaming module.
8484828	8485369	It was a big PC one.
8502910	8524061	at the first umlaut I bought collector's editions of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King granted the Burning Crusade one was all autographed but I gave it to someone for a Christmas present and then I kept the Wrath of the Lich King one which I actually still haven't even used because I already had it so I just bought it for the I actually do have my Final Fantasy XI beta discs still nice yeah
8524784	8527225	Loki, anything you've ever bought just to have for your collection?
8527325	8528465	Like, I don't know, a Japanese 3DS?
8528485	8529846	Motorstorm Apocalypse.
8530346	8531206	And not play it?
8532066	8533867	Yeah.
8536308	8543090	Well, I bought like three copies of Earth Defense Force, but they were cheap.
8545150	8548251	I've played this about once or twice, President Cat.
8549031	8549332	Nice.
8549712	8550752	I want to borrow it.
8551692	8551952	Sure.
8552313	8553753	If we can get it to work on my system.
8554707	8555047	Can't.
8556348	8557068	Without a mod chip.
8559209	8560950	Well, then she's going to have to borrow the Wii, too.
8562290	8562650	Can't.
8563031	8564391	Wife is playing Animal Crossing.
8564451	8564651	Don't.
8565432	8565772	All right.
8567393	8568113	Is that it for emails?
8568813	8569253	That's it.

8572595	8577117	Now, I know you're all dying to know the results of tonight's list list, so let's get to the results.
8579724	8581445	We have the definitive list, you guys.
8581565	8582505	This is it.
8582565	8584405	These are the three things we want.
8584485	8586206	Actually, it's four tonight because there was a tie.
8586546	8591928	But these are the things that we demand for us to care about PlayStation Network when it comes back up online.
8592248	8596149	Number three, a PlayStation 2 emulator download.
8597009	8597690	That's the number three.
8598190	8599671	Number two, it's a tie!
8600371	8608716	The number two thing you most want that will bring you back to PlayStation Network, the Clerks animated series back on the air, and gay pornography!
8609397	8610457	Yay, porn!
8611078	8619863	And the number one thing that could get you to come back and give a shit about PlayStation is if it were to morph into a Dreamcast 2!
8620163	8622145	Yay!
8623393	8623633	Dreamcast!
8623653	8623793	BANG!
8646030	8646570	Not funny.
8646791	8649472	Black Wolf says, I voted for lesbian porn.
8649872	8650673	It's lady gay.
8652854	8653415	Same diff.
8653955	8654755	Gay with boobs.
8654896	8655496	That's right.
8657257	8658098	I'm moving on.
8659298	8660399	These are all formalities.
8661320	8663201	We're going to get to the ranty part of the show.
8663261	8665962	It's the part of the show we call the FUs of the week.
8666042	8666623	Rawr.
8682421	8682981	DarkSakura.
8684522	8686583	F you to me not having any tacos right now.
8687864	8691826	I really want fish tacos from Carolinas, but I don't want to drive out and get them.
8692166	8693407	I got you that last week.
8693747	8696029	I know.
8697329	8697810	Taco.
8698650	8699290	And finals.
8700231	8703273	Freaking finals and four hour rendering in Maya.
8703973	8704593	Bite my butt.
8705874	8706194	Loki.
8709396	8709976	My head hurts.
8710316	8711097	Guess F you to that.
8714079	8729826	I guess this show makes your head hurt yes my FU goes to myself for staying up until 4.30 in the morning yesterday I was driving home from the Bay Area very late that was kind of dumb but I slept until noon today and that part was awesome
8731206	8732287	There we go, that's CFU's of the week.
8733207	8735989	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.
8736009	8740071	We're going to open it up at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype.
8740211	8743313	Orange Lounge Radio will be open just after a couple more stories.
8743373	8743633	Loki?
8745214	8756881	One thing Nintendo, I guess, was bad about for this generation of games was launching really big titles around when third parties are launching their really big titles.
8757361	8758721	3DS, Super Mario, Mario Kart
8774806	8776987	They said they want other companies to be successful.
8777007	8790713	In order to accomplish this goal, they're going to decide on dates after they know what the release plans of other companies are so that they can be considerate to them and so that they can all maximize their sales for the short term.
8792458	8793559	So that's kind of cool, at least.
8793700	8794361	How considerate.
8794901	8795242	Yes.
8797344	8801790	Well, I guess that's one way to help get third parties on board for your new system.
8803052	8804393	Not fucking them over like that.
8804634	8805275	That'd be awesome.
8806676	8806977	Awesome.
8808238	8812242	Alright, well, one more story for you guys, and it has to do with a useless peripheral!
8812342	8813363	Yay!
8814024	8818869	This is a peripheral by CTA Digital, and it's going to cost you $13.
8820190	8820791	Guess what it is?
8821271	8823634	It's a steering wheel for Kinect!
8824588	8828933	You know, that's not as bad as the inflatable boat.
8828953	8829934	The inflatable boat?
8830014	8831676	That thing was fucking awesome.
8832116	8832917	But here it is.
8833077	8834218	This is the coolest thing about it.
8834319	8835540	It's translucent.
8836100	8841346	It's a see-through steering wheel because, I guess, with the Kinect, you don't want the Kinect to see the steering wheel.
8841747	8842868	It's only going to see your hands.
8843108	8845931	Okay, who drives with a steering wheel up at their face?
8846011	8846492	I mean, are you...
8848401	8852462	I'm not going to mention anything because that's just only going to be racist if I do anything like that.
8852663	8857404	I just drive with one hand on the steering wheel usually, but Kinect doesn't recognize that.
8857444	8860445	I have to drive like a regular person, like 10 and 2.
8861365	8863566	You have to drive like you're a bad actor.
8864306	8864946	Exactly.
8867087	8867807	So there you go.
8868287	8869967	Make sure you pre-order that right away.
8870508	8871528	Hey, guess what, folks?
8871628	8875369	If you want to be able to do such things as drive without, you know...
8877106	8877547	DarkSakura.com
8902335	8903856	They need to power me with tacos.
8903876	8909360	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8909761	8915745	By the way, Black Wolf wants to clarify in the chat room, I tried playing Joyride using the Mario Kart Wii wheel and it didn't work.
8916025	8917386	So that's why it's translucent.
8917987	8918307	I see.
8918547	8920829	We'll trick those infrared beams after all.
8921129	8922290	Alright, the calls are coming in already.
8922350	8923331	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8923351	8923711	Who's this?
8924311	8926373	Hey, it's your local plug whore, Ranma.
8926493	8928875	Of course you get in the Skype line first too.
8928975	8930276	It's like you have a gift.
8930476	8931457	Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
8932057	8933940	Before I begin, I just got one thing to say, Rob.
8934000	8934220	Yes.
8934901	8935462	A blender?
8936063	8936383	Really?
8936563	8937004	A blender?
8940128	8941029	What's wrong with the blender?
8941129	8943312	This just proves to me that you have been listening to the show.
8943933	8945215	I will confirm or deny nothing.
8949127	8952389	Okay, I'm going to make this quick and move it along, okay?
8952910	8953110	Yes.
8953830	8967478	Alright, first thing, in response about Nintendo's next-gen controller, I would be just happy if they just took the original Super NES controller, put two analog sticks on there, and a little touchscreen, and I'll be happy.
8967798	8975463	Okay, touchscreen, I don't really see the point of that, but if you need a Super Nintendo controller with two analog sticks, that would be called a classic controller.
8976533	9000528	That's all we need But I can understand I'd be happy with a Super Nintendo controller with a fleshlight attachment That's what I'd be happy with Oh god Nintendo's gonna deliver an experience like never before This system's only adults only Fuck you kids, we don't need you anymore You said we weren't hardcore enough?
9000568	9004050	Well fuck you No, seriously, fuck you
9005669	9007030	I'm waving the flag over here.
9007050	9010352	It's the Nintendo Fuck You coming out this Christmas.
9014154	9015375	That's a pretty catchy name.
9016836	9017376	Where were we?
9017436	9017877	I'm sorry.
9017897	9020018	It's CeeLo Green to sing the theme song.
9021539	9022620	Oh, God.
9027162	9027783	Ah, yes.
9033200	9035862	Hold on, I'm sorry for the dead air here, but I'm setting something up here.
9035922	9036582	Hold on, here we go.
9037463	9042006	All right, let's see here if I can... Oh, goddammit, I can't... Okay, here we go.
9043647	9043807	Ah!
9044928	9046229	Never mind, the joke's derailed now.
9046269	9047950	All right, what do you want... Oh, there we go.
9049931	9053974	Coming this Christmas from Nintendo.
9057256	9060959	The company that brought you such hardcore games as The Legend of Zelda.
9062102	9063544	It's the Nintendo, fuck you!
9065707	9066488	What were you calling about?
9068190	9073716	Touchscreens, but on retrospect of that, I said the next gen console should be called the Nintendo.
9073877	9074638	Simple as that.
9076180	9079604	It's gonna be something really retarded like Nintendo HD or like...
9081641	9092528	I mean, because seriously, the DS, the 3DS, I mean... I would... If they're going with this whole Facebook route, I would say it's going to be called Nintendo.com.
9092828	9093909	Will be the name of the system.
9093929	9094789	Games.com.
9094809	9095270	Wait, wait, wait.
9095350	9096230	Here's how it will be.
9096631	9098131	The Nintendo HD.
9098292	9103635	So HD, lowercase i, lowercase i. What?
9104896	9105176	Get it?
9105356	9105856	It's like the Wii.
9106116	9107257	Nintendo HD.
9107577	9107918	Oh, HD.
9108278	9108378	Oh.
9114236	9118157	What do they need to put in a Nintendo console to make you really excited, Ranma?
9118297	9119938	Or are you just excited on principle?
9121498	9124959	I want more 2D Mario Brothers because I'm sick of the 3D Mario games.
9125019	9125539	I'm sorry.
9126799	9129400	I thought Mario 64 was great, and then I got tired of it.
9129440	9133521	You mean to tell me I'm sitting here going through the level eight times to get these stars.
9133801	9134141	That's it.
9134642	9134982	I'm done.
9135382	9136302	No more of that.
9138735	9142918	Yeah, well, what about all those people that are like, Mario 64 is the best game ever made?
9144358	9146160	I'm going to plead the Fifth Amendment on that one.
9146600	9149802	Oh, that means I should play the CeeLo song again.
9150102	9150402	All right.
9150462	9150682	Yes.
9152844	9154565	All right, well, any other thoughts for the listeners tonight?
9155405	9162029	Oh, yeah, I did find out something that before Activision canceled the entire Guitar Hero franchise, they were actually working on one more game.
9162209	9164571	Well, now, it could come back someday.
9164631	9166172	They've left the door open a crack.
9166792	9168153	They haven't shut the door on it completely.
9168803	9171945	Yes, it's called Guitar Hero, Grateful Dead Edition.
9172025	9177309	It comes with five songs, 20 minutes each, and the collector's edition comes with a one-pound bag of weed.
9177749	9182593	I was going to say, the punchline has to be like a pound of coke or a pound of weed.
9185615	9188057	The Motley Crue version comes with a one-pound bag of crack.
9191439	9192040	And a straw.
9196984	9199466	Now that's living the rock star experience.
9200627	9200947	All right.
9201388	9203710	On that note, Ranma, we'll let you go.
9205011	9205352	Bye.
9205532	9205952	Take care.
9205972	9209876	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9210257	9212979	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but there's already calls coming in.
9213019	9214000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9214020	9214381	Who's this?
9215241	9216543	Good evening, OLR.
9216583	9217403	This is Blue Swim.
9217464	9218064	Hey, Blue Swim.
9218084	9218745	What's on your mind, buddy?
9220511	9226096	I was wondering if you guys heard about the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure.
9227677	9228558	Is it interesting?
9229218	9239046	I mean, well, I don't want to sound rude, but like, you know, we tried to get all the details a couple months ago and weren't very successful.
9239106	9242769	It was kind of like trying to, I don't know.
9242829	9243069	All right.
9243089	9245010	Well, what's the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure?
9246331	9248153	Actually, it is going mobile.
9249742	9250242	Oh, okay.
9250302	9261069	Yeah, I seem to remember something about the whole thing where they were going to... Yeah, I remember him saying he was trying to strike deals with people like Android and iPhone and all that stuff.
9261089	9261930	So it's going mobile, huh?
9262970	9269935	Yeah, it looks to be iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Windows 7 phone with Android to follow.
9270695	9272636	And it looks like it's going to come out on June 7th.
9273277	9273517	Wow.
9273537	9274237	99 cents?
9276318	9287312	Um, didn't say anything about price, but it's going to have new levels, new music, new features, and the Xbox version is going to get it as well.
9288514	9289395	Oh, interesting.
9290056	9293040	So they're going to upgrade the existing one or there's going to be an all new one?
9294804	9300427	From what I'm seeing, it looks like it will be upgrading the original on the Xbox Live indie games.
9300507	9302728	Nice, because I already bought that one, so that would be cool.
9303029	9306090	By the way, if you've never played Techno Kitten Adventure, it's a disgustingly simple game.
9306390	9311113	You play a kitten that's flying through the air to techno music, and you just don't want to hit a wall, or you'll hear a little meow.
9311673	9312934	Actually, I should fire up a clip.
9312974	9313974	It's been a couple months, right?
9314175	9315695	We're all ready to hear the song again, right?
9316276	9316676	Hell yeah.
9316896	9318257	Let me fire up YouTube here.
9318537	9319537	Now, where did you read about this?
9319597	9320558	On his official website?
9320578	9321959	Do you subscribe to the dude's blog?
9323159	9327962	Actually, I saw it on the official Techno Kitten Adventure Twitter feed.
9328042	9330543	I think it's Iken has kitten or something like that.
9331264	9334145	And it's linking to an article on No Gamer Left Behind.
9335226	9336047	All right, well, here you go.
9336107	9340009	If you have never played Techno Kitten Adventure before, then you're missing out on this.
9355167	9363230	Blue Swim, I just couldn't believe that guy made this game because that guy, when we interviewed him, sounded like he'd been playing a lot of Grateful Dead Guitar Hero, if you know what I mean.
9365911	9371153	Yeah, I mean, have you seen a new screenshot?
9371393	9371853	I haven't.
9374551	9375272	I love them now.
9375993	9376313	So cute.
9376634	9377776	No, I haven't seen the new screenshot.
9377796	9378176	Where are they?
9379378	9382222	I retweeted it on my Twitter feed.
9383383	9385707	Twitter.com slash Blue Swim.
9386287	9387189	Cheap plug, cheap plug.
9387229	9387629	Yes, I know.
9388050	9390173	I'm a graduate of the Mick Foley School of Cheap Pops.
9390673	9392515	All right, let's see.
9393136	9393737	I don't see it yet.
9393757	9394478	It hasn't popped up yet.
9394518	9395158	Hold on, I'm waiting.
9395519	9396480	Wait, just now you did?
9396760	9398042	Or... Oh, no, I see, I see.
9398202	9398682	Oh, there it is.
9398702	9399283	A few days ago.
9400144	9401546	Okay, new screenshots you can has.
9402066	9404369	Oh, now there's pink dolphins and...
9405390	9406291	More rainbows.
9406671	9407791	Quadruple rainbow.
9407831	9408452	What does it mean?
9408872	9417337	Also, there is a little blimp in the screen, and I thought at first it said fart on the blimp, but it actually says party.
9417777	9424341	It's just a little marquee that's scrolling, and it looked like it said fart, but I'd laugh if there was a blimp that randomly flew across the screen and said fart.
9425122	9427163	Looks like the visuals are better.
9427972	9429633	Oh sure, I'm sure they've had a chance to touch it up.
9429713	9436236	But it's not as cool as, what was it, that one kitten that flies around with the rainbow and has an annoying song with it.
9438537	9439038	Same game?
9439058	9439778	No, I don't know.
9439898	9442039	Oh, the unicorn adventure?
9442099	9443040	No, the meme.
9444180	9444821	Oh, I don't remember.
9445961	9446201	Alright.
9446682	9449183	The one that's like, yeah, I forget the song.
9449203	9453145	It was one that was superimposed over the portal lines.
9454386	9457087	Alright, well, Blue Swim, do you have any other things you want to share with us tonight?
9458822	9460503	I think that's about it.
9461103	9465085	Enjoy Technokitten Adventure and don't do drugs.
9466165	9467066	Hey, I don't.
9467106	9470787	I've done them for 24 years and I'm looking to keep that streak going.
9471187	9471627	Take care.
9472308	9472608	You too.
9472828	9473328	Good night, guys.
9474409	9477670	I know he probably doesn't do drugs, but I'm just saying.
9478870	9482012	Oh, they're saying that they should make a game out of Nyan Cat.
9483272	9484573	Is that what you were thinking of earlier?
9484593	9485073	Nyan Cat?
9485812	9486493	Alright, Nyan Cat.
9486753	9487253	That's what it is.
9487674	9491757	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9493498	9497321	And if you're like one of the two people on the internet who hasn't seen it, here it is just for Loki.
9499263	9500224	I have seen it.
9501044	9501885	But it's a thing.
9502065	9505267	That's much cooler than Technicut and Adventure.
9506589	9507849	Can you imagine a game based off that?
9509571	9510331	1 April Fools.
9510432	9512433	I just want to do the whole show with this in the background.
9518638	9519278	It's pretty awesome.
9519359	9520379	Admit it, you're singing along now.
9522841	9524842	Hey, Thomas Howard, sing over that.
9529605	9530546	Let's go to the phones.
9530686	9531967	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
9531987	9532347	Who's this?
9532507	9533708	Yeah, it's Legend of Zaku here.
9533788	9534969	Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?
9536487	9541911	Nothing much, just trying to get all my chilling and relaxing before work tomorrow.
9542452	9549377	But more importantly, trying to see if I could compare two parallels for you.
9549617	9554060	In terms of what I've heard last night and what I've seen this weekend.
9554721	9560665	Case in point, Konami basically stagnating on DDR and Activision whoring out Call of Duty.
9561526	9564228	And Guitar Hero, and basically any franchises that touch it.
9565365	9577007	And to that point, it's like... The way I see it is that the only way Konami could really dig that franchise out of the grave, more or less, is that they have to move beyond the four arrows.
9578227	9591550	I know some people are just going to be... They're basically going to eat me alive for what I'm saying, but if you look at the way Harmonix managed to take advantage of Kinect and run with it, it's pretty apparent that physical controls are no longer...
9592642	9593584	They no longer apply.
9594506	9596910	As long as a camera is able to do all the work for you.
9600196	9600758	If you agree,
9602711	9607393	So you think that the cameras should just do everything and that there's no need for a dance pad anymore?
9607773	9608753	Well, it's not even that.
9609053	9612594	They need more modern controls.
9613114	9626198	If you're still relying on a panel with four sensors to actually register input, then you're still stuck in the past when people have arms and legs that you should be able to capture.
9627310	9633493	Either through the camera or some other panel that doesn't have any intricate parts like that.
9634144	9638106	Hasn't DDR kind of tried the whole, like, arms and legs thing before, though?
9638146	9641027	I feel like every DDR game does something with the gimmicks.
9641427	9651512	Yeah, once again, they just... It's not even gimmicky in the sense, you have to, like, if you look at how Dance Central's only, like, you're only, you're standing up while dancing, essentially.
9652232	9662217	If you were able to create a version, you know, a future dancing game that not only did that, but allowed you to do breakdancing moves, which is, like, really, really wishful thinking I'm pulling out right now.
9662797	9664058	That would be a killer feature.
9664678	9666679	Now, why don't we just give them the choice?
9666799	9672222	You know, the choose between doing... Now I understand that Konami's kind of... Eh, when it comes to implementing stuff.
9672562	9677525	They're basically taking the same thing, applying the same methods, and expecting different results.
9677585	9679326	That, my friends, is insanity.
9680887	9682228	I mean, something has to give.
9683527	9688752	Because at this point, I somewhat care about DDR, but it's not important anymore.
9689392	9690693	I've moved on in that sense.
9691294	9695558	Ever since CF closed back home in New York City, it's just like it doesn't matter.
9696278	9697700	I wouldn't give two shits right now.
9701390	9710356	Other people may feel different, but that's them, and that's because they're still holding on.
9711857	9716140	Last time I was on a dance pad was a few weeks ago, and before that, months.
9716820	9719102	I'm going without DDR.
9719122	9721764	At this point, I'm fine.
9721804	9723445	It won't kill me if I don't play.
9723945	9724605	Not that addictive.
9730169	9731011	Thank you for watching!
9745851	9747632	Well, Zach, let me ask you a question.
9747772	9750152	Isn't it okay to let the franchise die?
9750312	9753653	I mean, like, for example, Combat on the Atari 2600.
9753713	9754233	You know what?
9754773	9755374	It's just done.
9755654	9756934	There's never going to be another one.
9757254	9758054	Let's just let it be.
9758114	9759855	I mean, is it okay to just say, you know what?
9760775	9762175	We don't need DDR anymore.
9762315	9765356	We have stuff like Dance Central or we have other dance games.
9765536	9768617	I mean, can't we just let bygones be bygones, so to speak?
9768957	9783745	I guess what Konami needs to do is, like, maybe, I don't know if they should retire the series, but try to move it on with a more spiritual successor.
9784425	9788508	Something that really isn't DDR, but it's the next evolution in that whole genre.
9788788	9790489	Well, isn't that supposed to be what Dance Masters is?
9791309	9793332	Yeah, but that one was a rushed job.
9793952	9801061	They didn't really think it out because it was just a simple grab for money as a Kinect launch title.
9801481	9806327	I mean, now that the cat's already out of the bag... I know, the cat is out of the bag.
9807699	9816305	I mean, Konami really needs to take a good look at what, you know, what they can do to differentiate themselves from the competition and still be profitable.
9816765	9832594	I know it's a Herculean task, but, I mean, it worked for Harmonix in trying to, you know, to win over Guitar Hero folks in Rock Band, because that one, you know, the innovation right there was just, you know, add more peripherals, and from there, add more DLC.
9833735	9836556	and so forth and try to bring more realism into that experience.
9836596	9840077	Trying to bring an experience into their living rooms.
9840117	9840877	Or an arcade.
9841037	9842577	We gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.
9842697	9843938	Do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
9845258	9845898	Let's see.
9846338	9852420	PSN is probably the way I see PSN is like they're gonna need more than a prayer.
9852500	9855201	They're kind of done if they're completely compromised.
9856201	9856921	Alright, Zaku.
9857061	9858242	Well, thank you so much for the call.
9858962	9859402	Have a good one.
9860137	9860698	2 step in, 1 step out
9889509	9895890	No, I agree with the fact that they just didn't really implement a lot of things well.
9895950	9898451	And I think Dance Masters could be good.
9898571	9901872	It's just they didn't do it right the first time around.
9902252	9908173	There's a lot of things that they glaring omissions that, you know, hey, you know, it'd be fun.
9908973	9912934	It's a way to learn those routines instead of having to play them over and over and over again and fail.
9914454	9916616	DarkSakura wants to start us then.
9941707	9944149	Well, apparently Stephen Colbert is part of the Noble Team.
9944830	9945931	Well, not actually.
9946131	9947592	What?
9948393	9957080	This actually comes from a joke that he made about Master Chief being one of the original members of SEAL Team 6.
9958402	9964367	And so Bungie pulled off the image and put him on an armored body.
9965628	9965728	It's
9967307	9968087	It's just a mock-up.
9968187	9969948	It's not real, but it was pretty funny.
9971248	9983132	And then there was a quote going around saying that Valve was getting rid of single-player games, but really they're invoking single-player plus to where you have social interactivity in your one-player games.
9986093	9986374	That's it.
9989174	9992176	Loki, you have any final stories or last minute stories for us tonight?
9992336	9993317	Yeah, real quick.
9994698	9996979	I think I mentioned this back a while ago.
9997039	10005805	There was an indie game that was coming out on the Xbox indie marketplace that kind of combined, almost think of it like DDR meets Puzzle Quest.
10006505	10007966	But it's out now, actually.
10008026	10009047	It's called Sequence.
10009627	10010727	And definitely check it out.
10010848	10015590	There's basically three different screens that are available that you switch between.
10015630	10018632	Kind of think of like the Rock Band, PSP, and DS version.
10020013	10023835	And then you, you know, tap up the sequences.
10024875	10027937	And one of them, I think, is like for health regeneration.
10028077	10028858	One's defense.
10028898	10031239	Another is like a magic or attack or something like that.
10032681	10033082	Check it out.
10033322	10035565	It's available right now for $3 or 240 Microsoft points.
10035585	10036287	The title is Sequence.
10040343	10066605	and of course it was announced this week that Nintendo is dropping the price of the Wii Bundle to $150 even though it was rumored so all Wii systems are now going to be $150 they're also putting out a new Wii Bundle that's going to be with Mario Kart and of course the Wii Remote Plus and that kind of stuff available in black and white and they're also going to be selling Wii Sports separate because obviously this does not come with Wii Sports
10067045	10067485	Thanks for watching!
10083078	10088123	Mario Super Sluggers, Wii Sports, and Zelda Twilight Princess Where the fuck is the love for Excite Truck is what I gotta ask
10102876	10104177	But, you know, whatever.
10104938	10109321	And then finally, also in the UK, they're going to be doing the Nintendo Selects as well.
10109721	10121830	They're going to have a little bit different of a lineup, starting with Wii Sports Course, WarioWare Smooth Moves, which is a pretty awesome game, Animal Crossing, and Mario Strikers.
10123952	10126874	Charge, their football game over there.
10129475	10131916	and then I mentioned this on my Twitter feed earlier.
10132377	10139020	Nintendo has conceded that they have struggled with online on the Wii and they promise to improve it with the next system.
10139181	10139881	Oh, Nintendo.
10140421	10141202	You didn't have to.
10141582	10151627	It says, honestly speaking, the Wii's future could have been different if Nintendo had made better partnerships with outside companies in the field of network services at early stages of penetration of the Wii.
10153009	10153709	Penetration.
10155171	10160077	In other words, Nintendo might have been a little obsessed with the policy.
10165006	10165306	All right.
10165826	10170569	Well, if that does it for Last Minute Stories, then we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10170649	10175931	First off, we want to thank you guys for downloading and listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week or tuning in live, whatever the case may be.
10176531	10183274	All we ask, we don't really play commercials except for other podcasts, but we don't make any money off this show.
10183354	10185675	All we ask, tell two friends about the show.
10185755	10186576	Help us spread the word.
10187296	10189897	Even if you don't know who to tell, you can leave us a nice review on iTunes.
10189937	10192238	We've had some wonderful five-star reviews in the past couple weeks.
10192379	10193199	Really appreciate those.
10193599	10199921	They really do go a long way in helping us get visibility and continuing to spread the word of Nyan Cat being played over phone calls.
10201222	10203302	DarkSakura, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
10204383	10205543	I really freaking want a taco.
10207544	10211565	My final thought is I'm gonna just go get a taco.
10211805	10212566	That's what I'm gonna do.
10213346	10214486	Don't make a stinky face at me.
10215227	10216007	Loki, your final thought?
10217527	10220128	I joined Mensa and all I got was this membership card.
10222978	10239598	And discounts off Geico But it's official, you're smart Alright, that's it everybody Have a wonderful week, we are done for the night But yeah, have a good one We'll see you next week, we'll be back to do it all again So join us, bye You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
10240018	10240678	www.allgames.com
10282595	10309984	Alright, so something special after the credits tonight here on OLR because mostly I'm an idiot and I forgot to play this earlier in the show but of course today is Mother's Day in the United States and I believe other countries too but I want to say a very happy Mother's Day to all the mommies out there all the motherly figures or whoever is considered a mother in your life I want to say a happy Mother's Day to everybody and you know once in a while here on the show we like to do a phone call to mom
10311704	10313805	So I think a couple years ago we called DarkSakura's mom.
10313825	10314725	We've called my mom before.
10314745	10316846	I think even Loki's mom's probably been on the show at some point or another.
10317546	10321187	So tonight I wanted to give you guys an extra surprise.
10321287	10325028	And this is a very special thing for you guys that have listened through the whole thing.
10325308	10328869	You've either stayed up very late with us live or you've listened through the entire podcast.
10328909	10333491	But I promised you at some point I would have my mother review Mortal Kombat.
10335011	10339593	And so I have a clip of my mother watching me play Mortal Kombat.
10339613	10342634	And she actually said, if you put the video on the internet, I will kill you.
10343214	10347035	However, she didn't say I couldn't play the audio for you guys on my radio show.
10347055	10348036	Who's going to tell your mom?
10348096	10349136	Who's going to tell my mom?
10349176	10350356	So here it is, folks.
10350396	10350776	New contest.
10350796	10351977	Who's going to tell Rob's mom?
10352017	10355958	This is the first time my mother watched us play Mortal Kombat.
10355978	10358039	And just for the record, it was Melina versus Stryker.
10358479	10358919	Here we go.
10359820	10361400	Okay, so I'm here with my mommy.
10361960	10362941	Your hair looks fine.
10363301	10364541	Say hi to the internet, mom.
10365102	10366882	Oh, look, there's a big thing sticking out.
10366942	10367443	You're fine.
10367483	10368103	You look fine.
10368443	10368703	Okay.
10368823	10369423	How are you doing?
10370904	10371404	I'm fine.
10371844	10373885	So we wanted to show you a video game.
10374125	10375446	It's a new video game that came out.
10375506	10376526	It's called Mortal Kombat.
10376546	10377246	Have you ever heard of it?
10377847	10378167	Yeah.
10378667	10379467	And what do you know of it?
10380228	10380868	It's violent.
10381868	10383549	And what do you think about violence in games?
10384669	10385710	I think it's pathetic.
10386250	10386510	Why?
10386530	10386590	Why?
10387748	10389950	because it teaches little kids to be violent.
10390590	10392892	But can't you, like, supervise little kids?
10393172	10395374	Didn't I play Mortal Kombat when I was a kid?
10395494	10398616	No, I supervised kids, but a lot of parents don't.
10399597	10400017	Okay.
10400757	10405481	Well, we just wanted to show you the new game and see what you think of the graphics and the technology.
10407162	10407762	Look at her.
10407843	10408803	She's not even dressed.
10408823	10410805	That's disgusting.
10410825	10412006	I need a comment about that, yeah.
10412046	10412806	Let's dance.
10416906	10418427	Her nipples aren't in the right place.
10419448	10420809	If they were, you could see them.
10425372	10426873	Look at her, she's an Amazon.
10427454	10428975	Oh my god, they threw her around.
10429035	10438122	So do you think stage fatality, Rob, or the, uh... I would do her normal one.
10440223	10441765	Is that blood all over the stage?
10442125	10442425	Yep.
10442925	10443606	Oh my god.
10446738	10448380	She hit him right in the cahoongas.
10452583	10453144	What's her name?
10453584	10454005	Melina.
10456087	10457608	What is that she has on?
10457788	10459069	There's some places missing.
10464214	10467737	This is a game that's rated PG-17, right?
10468337	10469398	It's rated M for Mature.
10469819	10473202	Oh, it should be rated No Kids Allowed, really.
10476448	10477389	She's giving him kisses.
10488994	10492016	Kids have no threshold for violence.
10492116	10492616	That's why.
10492716	10494677	Because they're conditioned that way.
10496278	10496738	You got it?
10497818	10505062	So after you beat the guy, you get to... Here's the best part.
10507071	10508152	She's going to take his head off.
10511435	10512376	Oh my god.
10517820	10518281	I knew it.
10524546	10525767	And look at her outfit.
10527769	10528390	Look at that.
10529711	10530772	What did you think?
10531512	10532193	It's disgusting.
10533967	10534448	There you go.
10534528	10535268	I love your mom.
10535588	10539170	My mother reacting to... Okay, so was it the regular outfit or was it like the tape outfit?
10539590	10540671	No, it wasn't the tape outfit.
10540691	10543092	It was her regular little hoochie mama outfit there.
10543112	10544933	Because the tape outfit is worse.
10545033	10545814	Yeah, the tape outfit.
10546014	10547074	We hadn't unlocked that yet.
10547094	10548355	We haven't gotten to the top of the tower.
10548375	10550376	I think Alan's on like challenge 120 or something.
10550916	10551517	So there you go.
10551857	10554138	My mother seeing Mortal Kombat for the very first time.
10554318	10555098	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
