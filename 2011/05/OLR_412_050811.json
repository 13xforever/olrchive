{"text": " Today, May 8th, 2011, Sony is on Day 18 of PlayStation Network Outage, has a dev kit for the next Xbox when spotted in a game developer, and Club Nintendo makes a controversial change to their privacy policy. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It's the show where every gamer has a voice. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours here live with my co-host with me. Of course, the one, the only, the awesome DarkStalker, Jamie Summers. Heck yeah. How are you doing? Awesome. And also very humble, might I add. Heck yeah. All right. Well, happy Mother's Day to you. What? You're a mommy to Shermy, the kitty. Oh yeah. Well then happy Mother's Day to you too. Oh, well thank you very much. I appreciate it. All right. Also joining us tonight, Tech Master, Loki. Hi. And please pass along a happy Mother's Day to the Mrs. Forest. I will do that. So how are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. I see you're chugging along there on Portal 2. Yes, I am. So awesome. I beat a game this week. I beat Portal 2. That's a huge landmark for me, you guys, because I have the worst. If you listen to this show for any length of time, you know, I have the worst gaming ADD in the world. I play a game for literally five minutes. Then I'm like, ooh, Shiny, another game. I'll go play that. I mean, there's so much out there to play. There's so many games that come out every week. I mean, not just like, you know, in retail, but you have the download games that are available. Well, you know, we're available on one console. And you know, so on and so forth. There's just so much to play. PC and so on. I don't always get around everything. But yeah, I actually played Portal 2 to completion and beat it. Yay. So I feel accomplished. I don't know why. Also, it's short. That helps. Rob. What? The potato is not a lie. I don't want to spoil it because I know there's some people that still haven't played it. I have to say the ending. Well, I lulled at the very, very, very, very end. But for the rest of it, I was kind of like, oh, that's it? I was kind of, oh, I thought there was going to be a little bit more, but I think something in my head, I made up a plot point in my head that didn't come to fruition. And I think that's why it was a little bit like, oh, I see. I was a little let down because I wasn't right on that point. I was right on everything else. But then when the other thing didn't come true, I was like, oh, I guess I can't tell the future after all. All right. Anyhow, join us in our chat room, chat.orangelandrado.com as we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at all games radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We got a lot of gaming news tonight. We're going to get into a list list in part B tonight that will be themed around of course the big, big story and so much more in just a little while. But first let's get into how we always start the show off. How was your gaming week? Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week? I played Portal 2 and got very sick and actually threw up this time. And I played some World of Warcraft. And in World of Warcraft, I played Bejeweled, which I think it broke on me because it stopped letting me fail for real because it's supposed to actually drop enough blocks that eventually it just, the game will crash on you. Well, not crash, but the game will just end because you don't have any more moves. And that never happened. So finally I just said, forget it and went to bed. And then I played Peggle. Yay, Peggle. Yes, I love Peggle. They haven't done anything with Peggle in a while. It seems like there was the coming to E3 super Peggle. There was the one that came out with a portal to the valve edition was like extreme Peggle. It's a freebie on steam. I don't remember that one. I think I missed it. Like a little like 10 level Peggle, but it's fun. I played the Peggle in wow. I played that too. There hasn't been a pop cap wow marriage in a while. Well, I mean, I guess there was the peace bloom versus ghouls or whatever. Cause I haven't done that. Oh, it's in a Hillsbrad mountains. Do you know where Taran Mill is? It's not far from there. Yeah. I've been going around actually looking for Easter eggs. Like the one I sent you. Did you get it? I did. I figured we haven't had that one pop up. So I've been going around looking for all the different Easter eggs. And the next thing I'm going to do is try to get into the, uh, the troll crypt because you can still do it, but you can't do it the way you used to be able to do it. You know what I'm talking about? I think so. Yes. With the upside down centers. What you should do is you should go for your Explorer achievement if you don't already have it. Cause it forces you to kind of visit the whole world. I've already got it on, um, ERISA. Okay. Well, except I don't have the, um, the, uh, uh, yes. All the cataclysm one yet because I skipped the under the underwater kingdom and I've just recently gone back and so I could get my, uh, exalted with them. And now I'm just like, people take me on heroics please. Well, I don't want to turn this too much into the wild show cause I already have a spinoff show for a while, but I do want to quickly say, um, you know, just, just even today you do find new stuff in the game once in a while. And that's kind of the fun thing about a virtual world, no matter what MMO you play. I think this can really be expanded to any MMO out there. Rift, Star Trek, whatever it is you play. It's always fun to sometimes go just go explore and like find new things. Like even just today, salacious pop was like, Hey Rob, I, I, I see this house here I've never seen before. That's kind of, it's not really on the map or anything. It's just like up here in the hill. And this guy wants junk boxes. I can't figure out what he's for. So it was just, you know, sometimes you find random stuff. Did you find the place where the animals have weapons? No. Where's that? There's um, I'll find it during the course of show, but there's a place that's like the only way you can get there is if you have a flying mount. And I think at the part that you're normally there, you don't have one. I think actually if I'm right, I think it's the Tauran starting area, but it's one place up at the top of the map that you can only get there with a flying mount. And then randomly different animals are wearing helmets. Okay. The prairie dogs wear helmets and carry knives. The rabbits carry battle axes and the rats wear skull helmets and carry two double barreled shotguns. That's kind of awesome. And they get bigger and then all of a sudden they'll shrink down and go to normal size. And I'm also going to try to wake up early in the morning and do the gold jar children thing. The only Easter, the only Easter egg area I've really explored was the one, it's right outside Stormwind. It's up in the Hills and there's all these sheep, just tons and tons of sheep that you can kill for the critter achievement. And if you kill them all though, the guy comes out of his house and he goes, what's wrong with you? That's just wrong. He starts yelling at you about what a bastard you are. There's another place, but you kill them. There's another place that has, um, and this will be the end of it, but this one was one I thought was really nice is there's a monument and a dwarf in red named Roush kneeling in front of it. And it reads, uh, rest in peace, Anthony T. Stark. People were calling that the iron man thing, but it's not. It's actually for a guy who was a friend of the developers and Roush was his character, the dwarf. So they made him an NPC. Very cool. I thought it was a nice gesture and the smiley face. I'll say this about another MMO, Final Fantasy 11. You know, I played that for many years before I played. Wow. One of the things I used to really like about that is that I really liked the ambience of that game. You know what? The graphics are more first person. I mean, they can be third person depending on how you play, but I just really liked exploring areas in that game because there were some really beautiful areas and great music. And because of the way the game was designed, you wouldn't always like see every area for a long time. So as you were progressing, which could sometimes take months and months, you would find these new areas and hear new music and it was just really cool. I mean, it was a frustrating ass grind. That's why I was so disappointed that 14 was such crap. I mean, sorry to say, I don't know what's going to happen to 14. We haven't heard of what's going on there in a while. I don't know if they're going to try to reboot or what. I don't know. Like a sliver in my pinky, the extra part of my pinky nail. I'd like to come back and make it like really awesome, but I don't know. I think it might be a lost cause at this point. Anyhow, just update 11 with new graphics and stuff and that's all you need to do. The game's awesome and not as pain in the ass of the grind. They did change a lot of stuff in 11 since you and I left. Like the level sinking thing is huge and you know, but there's only so much you can like cram into an old engine and that's where Warcraft starting to have that problem. Much different outfits. Seriously. There's so many different armors that change your look in world of Warcraft, but really in Final Fantasy 11, it's just like, oh, I'm wearing the bondage gear. Oh, now I'm wearing white mage robes. They're just very few new things and you can tell what anybody is by looking at them. And the other problem 14 had was that it tried to change it up too much. Like instead of being just a white mage and a black mage, now you could be a gladiator or a Theramaterge. Like what? That's not why I play Final Fantasy to be a fucking Theramaterge. Seriously, what is the point of having the same races but changing the names? Yeah, that was retarded. Silly. Anyway. Okay. Enough fan memo ranting. Let's talk about other guys. By the way, I must say that my wife's character, well, before she had the hairdo change, but she looked like Mel's Tarot Tarot at one point. Actually, no, she does look like Mel's Tarot Tarot now. Wait, wait, your wife had a Final Fantasy 11 character? No, I'm saying she's playing Animal Crossing. Her character in Animal Crossing looks like Mel's little Tarot Tarot because Mel looked like a little grandma. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always cracked me up. Awesome. There are those days, like I'll see those sales on Steam where it's like, Final Fantasy 11 is only $20 for the uber mega OMG I can't believe it version. And I'm like, I kind of want to go back. I kind of want to go back. Resist, resist. I will. I will. Alright, anyhow. Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing? Only really three things. Wait, more importantly, the chat room wants to know for the betting pool tonight, what food did you bring to the show? Uh, I brought a Carl's Jr. Western burger. There you go. I don't think anyone guessed Carl's Jr. We got a lot of losers in chat tonight. I don't normally get Carl's Jr. Every now and then I get Western. It was today. It was like I had a big burger for lunch and I didn't really know what I wanted to get. So I just picked up something because I, you know, if I didn't eat anything, I'd be hungry, but I didn't feel like anything. I almost brought nothing. I almost just had red bulls and it bought the wrong size red bull too. So these are like a red bull and a half. I'm still gonna drink two of them though. I had a red bull last night cause I was up until four 30. It's still the color of pee. It is, but it keeps you awake. I don't care. It makes my brain function. All right. Video games. What have you been playing this week? Break man in our chat asks, what's a Carl's Jr. If you're on the East coast, I think they call it Hardee's. Hardee's. Anyways, um, I played portal two, a lot of portal two and progressing nicely through it. See, I started off on the 360, but I decided, you know, okay, here's, here's that window. And I don't know if you'd, it's not technically piracy because I do own a copy of it. Just, I'm not playing the copy that I bought. Um, so I have the 360 copy. I have the PS3 copy that I got for free through my work, which has the PC steam copy. But as you know, PlayStation network is down, so I can't download my steam copy. So I pirated the PC copy and I'm playing that. So technically I own it on PC. I just am not playing that copy, but who cares? I'm enjoying it just fine on my laptop cause it runs very, very great. I can max out everything and um, let's see. And then I've been playing actually with my 360 controller, which is awesome. It was kind of a headache to get it to work. Well originally it was a headache, but until I figured out they have to have the controller turned on before you start the game. Now it works just fine. You know, it's the only game that seems like that's the issue for. Um, okay. So then beyond portal, I've been playing um, unpleasant horse, which is awesome. Especially throwing little flying horses into a meat grinders. Um, and then of course grand theft auto. That's it. Of course it just wouldn't be a Loki week without grand theft auto. We always play grand theft auto. The only time we're not going to play grand theft auto is when grand theft auto or another grand theft auto comes out. Then it will just be new grand theft auto. Exactly. Uh, video games I've been playing this week. Um, sadly nothing new. I mean, uh, there hasn't been a lot of the download games lately that have been very appealing, uh, that I've wanted to grab and nothing in retail is really jumping out at me right now. Uh, so, uh, just reiterating the same stuff I'd be portal to, as I said, at the top of the show, that was a big accomplishment. Still need to work on co-op. Mikkel, Tom, I know you're listening. You work on co-op, uh, more. I'll join you if, uh, well, I've got my PS3 copy and they'll, I'll join you once the network comes. Yeah, screw Mikkel top. We'll do it. All right. All right. Sounds good. Anyhow. Uh, let's see what else, uh, I've been playing or can't you do split screen? You can, but one of our controller PS3 controllers is still in a box. So there's only one controller. Well, how can we get it out of this impenetrable cardboard box? No, I know if only there were a way to break into the, the fortress that is the cardboard box. It's in a box. We don't know which box it's in. It's, it's like playing a game show. Well, it's very easy. There's a very simple solution to that. You rip open all the boxes, the PSN controller, the other box has the lube. We don't know which box you rip open all the boxes, dump them on the floor and then you'll find it. That's it. And then the cats have a new play space, which by the way, do you know we portal cats just tangent here? Cause I need to say this. We bought the cats a new bed, which I understand it takes cats time to get adjusted to a bed. We bought the cats an awesome pink bed with leopard print. It's the tackiest fucking thing you'll ever see. And I love it. And uh, yeah. Where did the cat decide to make its home? In the pile of dirty laundry. Of course you buy them nice things and they don't appreciate it. That's a cat earlier. I got Shermie this really nice series of cat beds that should just ignore. And then I pick up this one for 13 bucks on sale and it's her favorite thing. Just give it time because I know these things take like my cat. I got her a nice new bed and she was scared of it because it looked like a cat. Do you like your bed? Yeah. Dan says in the other room she slept on a box. She slept on a box. I had a cat that tried that he was a little bit bigger than the shoe box, but he ever since he was a kitten would sleep in the shoe box until he looked like a muffin loaf pouring over the edges of this box, but he would still cram laundry though. Then they have to use the cat bed. No, no. You know what they use when there's no dirty laundry? They use my chair. Oh, that's what they do. Anyway, I don't want to talk about cats. I want to talk about games, but I also want to talk about this comment. Mielethov just IME. He's like, well, just tell me when you want to play portal two and I'll play. But he also said, apparently I missed the remark about I'd go back for $5 to final fantasy 11 if you would to kind of like a suicide pact. Oh, sad. I like that. Oh man. If I had the time, I know, right. I would just get old times. Let's, let's just go not have a life again. And that's like, so I don't know. Uh, nonconformist because you know, everybody's like MMO. Wow. You know, fuck that. We're going to final fantasy 11. What? It's like, I don't know. Just, I missed grandma Tarou. Okay. Look, other games I've played, speaking of Final Fantasy, I'm still playing Final Fantasy four on the PSP. I play it for like 30 minutes before I go to bed every night. It's a nice little way to kind of, you know, rest before bed. I, I, of course I love that game on the super Nintendo. So of course I love the PSN port and I'm doing, I'm doing kind of the Jamie thing where I have to play it chronologically. Like, you know, where you guys are doing the final fantasy marathon. Well, I'm starting with four and then I'll play the interlude and then I'll play after years finally, which I played like a little bit of on the Wii, but I want to play it on the PSP cause I love the new graphics and it really is just a great looking game and I hope people didn't overlook it because it came out the same week as portal. Cause that would just be, I really want five and six to come out the portal. Exactly. Shiny. Um, otherwise I can't play portal on a PSP. That's most that's, yeah, that's true. He can't play portal in bed. Well actually you probably could play portal on a PSP if they hacked the, uh, you know, their streaming thing because I think it has enough buttons to where you can do it and just wouldn't build a zoom who needs zoom. Oh, and I also played a little bit of mortal combat, which would be very, very important at the end of the show. So I remember that. And then, um, let's see what else. Um, Oh, there was one other thing I wanted to mention. Oh, star craft too. Even though I am terrible, I've said that's the, that's the one I need to encourage a league for because I always talk to people about star craft too. And everybody I talk to is like, yeah, I'm really bad too. And I'm like, and nobody wants to play online because everybody's bad. So we need like a bad league. I have never played star craft too. It's it's the last RTS I played was red alert. The first red alert. Did you ever play like the original war craft or war craft too? I played war craft like once because I got a demo disc with PC gamer. That's how long ago on the CD ROM. It's really not that different. I mean it grant it's new graphics and all that stuff. I mean, but at its core, the old game or the, the star craft series is really like the old war craft games. Just, you know, I'm sure star craft fans get driven bonkers and I say that, but really at its core, it's kind of what it is, you know, collection, build buildings, build units, attack, kill, destroy, and so forth. So that was my gaming week. Join us in our chat room at chat dot orange launch radio.com. If you want to chat with us with tonight's news, we'll be reading a random comments in chat throughout the show. Um, silver Sonic in our chat room, for example, says, didn't you mean on Twitter that you played Minecraft? Uh, I, I played that last week. My review on Minecraft was last week and let me put it this way. I didn't play it again this week. This is Rob's review. No, it wasn't that I was kind of like, I see, you know what I think it is. I think Minecraft is a game for artists. I think Minecraft is very much a game for artists because it's about like creating and you know, destroying and chiseling. No, I have a question for me. I can't even draw a fucking, I have a question for you though. If Minecraft weren't say little pixelated blocks and they were Legos, would that make the game more? I love the little Lego builder. That's, I love that. You can download this thing on the PC. I think I mentioned this last week. You can make your own little Lego things and then actually have them ship to you instructions on how to build it because the computer program remembers how you built it and like, I guess a logic and they will send you all the appropriate bricks. So it's like this thing for people to do like eight bit sprites in Legos. That sounds more interesting to me than it really. It's way more interesting than Minecraft actually because I get something tangible out of it. You know, and not to knock people that spend a lot of time making stuff in Minecraft, but, um, you know, be also in Minecraft, you know, if you combine Minecraft, like the world and being able to build everything like that with ZZT where you can actually make your own games. Fuck yes, I would be all over that shit. Oh my God. Now we're talking like, I'm just shocked that there's like Minecraft podcasts and all this stuff. Like I'm, I don't, you know, there's a lot of videos of people like this is my basement and I want to support all indie podcasters. So look, I'm not knocking it. Like if you're into that, that's awesome. It's just, I, I feel like I, I feel so not cool for not understanding Minecraft. There's not, not even like that old crotchety man sitting in the rocking chair going, these kids in their Minecraft, I don't understand. We're not like knocking people saying, Oh, well you're wrong for liking Minecraft. It's just, we don't, don't get it yet. I don't know. It, you know, it might be something. The problem is I don't have enough free time to tinker with something like this when I can be playing other things. And you know, if I ever came across, you know, an extra 12 hours in a day where I could just sit there and build in Minecraft, then yeah, that might be a fun game for me, but I just don't have the time. Although if you want to like say port that over Nintendo and put some Animal Crossing characters in that and sell it to my wife, then I might get the play a little bit more. All right. Go into our chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com for some comments. Kaijuto in our chat room says, to understand Minecraft, you have to get the pay version. It has a lot more. The free version is a joke, but yeah, but if the free version isn't that great, then it doesn't really make me want to get the pay version, but I get it. Let's see. I apologize if I mispronounced this, but Entitelus, Entitelitus, Entitelitus says, what's the name of that 8-bit Zelda clone on the PS3 that came out a while back? That was a 3d.heroes. Yeah, that game was cool. I want another one of those. I'm surprised I never got sued. Uh, let's see. Black Wolf in our chat room says, it's okay, Rob. I don't understand. Wow. Yet some people do wow podcasts too. No, I'm with you Black Wolf. I don't understand wow either, but because you guys just aren't cool. It's sorry to say it like, you know, I'm not, I still like you guys. You're just not cool. I just, I never understood, you know, just from looking at the outside in my, you know, five second opinion of wow, you know, I just don't get it. It doesn't, I don't, it doesn't look appealing to me at all. Like I just Final Fantasy, it was a little bit more appealing because I understand, you know, a little bit of the lore at least, and I recognize the characters and that kind of thing. Wow. I never played enough, you know, Warcraft to begin with. I don't care. Here's, here's the thing about wow. Like I'll just like sum it up as fast as I can. It's really about the people that I play with that keep me doing it because if the people weren't there that I was playing with, I would've canceled my account a long time ago. I got really close this past week. Oh my God. I got so frustrated at something in the game. I really wanted to cancel my account, but I kind of have that podcast now and there's also the community of people I really like that also play it. So, and that's probably why the Minecraft people do their thing cause they've got a community too, but I'm just not able to be in that community because of a terrible, terrible, terrible artist. That's what it is. Well, I'm just saying, you know, the, uh, the best little tarot house in vanity is not that bad of a name either. All right, let's uh, let's move on. We need to get to some gaming news quickly. Housekeeping, uh, visit our website, orange on trader.com. Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge. And we're also on Twitter as O L R. It's like we have a different username everywhere. Sorry about that, but it's kind of a long name. All right, let's get to some gaming news once again. I think y'all know where we're going to go tonight right off the bat. Let's talk about the Atari. No, um, fucking love Atari combat rocks. Yes. Uh, station.com part of a Sony online. Apparently Sony online has gone down. Uh, they've dropped the, uh, or they suspend their services after they discovered an issue. That issue being that their, um, network was also infiltrated as part of that, uh, PlayStation network infiltration from hackers. Uh, apparently also they lost, uh, 12,700 credit card account numbers and 24.6 million accounts were compromised. That sucks. And of course they're letting everybody know, no, this wasn't a second attack. It was just part of the first attack. Yeah, that makes it all better. You know that they got it one swoop instead of twice because twice would just be ridiculous now, wouldn't it? Um, so yeah, uh, that does suck. And, um, you know, they really haven't said what they're doing, at least on the Sony online, um, side. I mean, I know there's a lot of stuff we'll be getting into about the PlayStation network, but uh, that sucks. And of course, I think for like the people that are playing, um, you know, the games on there, I think you're getting like a free month or something. So not good. It's just kind of interesting that this all comes out the week that, oh yeah, we're going to get the system back online. Oh shit, we got hacked more. But here's the thing though. It was from an outdated database, they said from 2007 and it says of the, um, 12,700 total, 4,300, I guess, were from Japan. Um, and then I guess some more from other European countries. They're saying though that, um, that the, uh, US credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates, not the security codes were part of that database. I actually have kind of a crazy question. Has anyone asked this question of Sony yet? I'm not sure, but I've got to put it out there. Why the fuck did they have credit card information from 2007? Why are they not required by law to purge that information? Why do they need it? You don't need credit card information from 2007, do you? I mean, maybe they need it for tax. It might be a service server backup or something like that. I don't know. Well, I don't care. You should have to purge that by law. I understand the only benefit of keeping information that only this just comes from working with loans is that you can go back and find issues where people have done fraud and you have to track back data that far. But at the same time though, like a lot of places will have server warehouses or backups or whatever. They'll pay a third party company to back up everything in like another, another branch somewhere. Like I know our company, we, uh, they have, I roll my eyes every time they mentioned something like this. They have a place in Arizona that's like a place that other companies send their data. It's like a, in case, you know, something catastrophic happens and the company is like incinerated, at least all this data is backed up in Arizona in like a mountains or something like that. A little crazy, but hey, you know what? If a company as small as ours is doing something like that, Sony should be storing it in like the bottom of a volcano and like the middle of like some sort of evil lair in the ocean or something or in the bottom of, you know, an iceberg in Antarctica or something. I don't know. Also, dark soccer, you worked for a bank, right? So for mortgage company owned by a bank, a financial institution needing that information for that long. I get that a way more than I do Sony needing that information. Sony is not a financial institution. I think having the information backed up on a separate server is one thing. Having it is still an active memory for lack of a better description. That's kind of dumb. I can see holding onto the information, especially for purposes of bookkeeping, accounting, you know, but it was how long, how old? Well, here's the thing they were saying. Seven is kinda, here's the thing they were saying though. Of the 12,700 cards stolen, 900 were still active. Oh, well, it's just 900 then. Well, that's why are we even making this an issue? Those 900 people can suck it. Wow. All right. So let's just pop in our chat room, but I give it a spread. This shines a little light on this saying, uh, I'm pretty sure they are going back two years or more at the porn place. We were only allowed to archive the last four digits and expiration date and dark soccer was right. It was in case we were ever subpoenaed or anything and had to look up legacy order history re sketchy use of a card. Like if it wasn't stolen and a relative was using it, but the whole card number was purged after a year, I think. Yeah, that's kind of the transaction history. I get that, but the card number and data itself, that is very weird. Tax audits was the only thing I can think of. Um, even then, doesn't your bank take, why did Sony need that? So bank having that, I get it. Sony having it, I don't. Yeah, I don't. There's a huge problem I have with that. Hence why we turn to Congress and what, why Congress is getting involved with all of this right now. And Sony actually responded to Congress this week. You might remember last week we talked to Congress was getting involved, writing a nice little letter to Sony going, uh, what the fuck is going on? Are you, did you put all these Americans informations at risk? You know, just basically in a nutshell there, um, cause her eyes and an open letter back to Congress detailing Sony's various principles and how they've been dealing with the PlayStation network outage and all the various leaks. Uh, it is on various blogs all over the place for you to take a look at. Uh, they also summarized it on the PlayStation blog. Uh, they had various principles that they worked with during this whole issue. Act with care and caution, provide relevant information to the public when it has been verified. Take responsibility for our obligations to our customers. Work with law enforcement authorities. Uh, also they've talked about the timeline for the attack. Uh, they said, quote, we discovered that the intruders had placed a file on one of our Sony online entertainment servers named anonymous with the words, we are, hold on. They hacked my computer too. Look, there is a text file right here. It says we are Legion. That's impossible. Only they could have done that. It's impossible that anybody else could create a text file that says we are Legion and they're named anonymous. How is this possible? How did they do this? I thought my network was secure. There was also a text. There's also a text file named Crayola in the system. Apparently with the names of 256 flavors of crayons. I don't know why they had that, but it was in the system. I have a comment on this. Yes, Dan, how are you Dan? Does anybody else find it ironic that our government is mad at Sony because when Sony overreacted to somebody hacking their system, the hackers came back to get them and it backfired on them, right? And we, we do that all the time. That's what we do. We're Americans. We're like that country stumbled their nose at us. Let's go get them. Five years later. Fuck. What were we thinking? Come on guys. Give Sony a break. They're dealing. But at the same time, you know, that's what they get. Fuckers. Well, it's just like, well, you know, I, I have blamed on this show an awful lot. The problem is Sony lies with the way they're being managed. They are a horribly managed company right now. Horribly managed company. And the only thing that is more horribly managed than Sony is the government. So this whole exchange really, like when I read about it, this is what I hear in my head. And it's, it's great cause they're like, Oh, we think anonymous did it because there was this text file. Yeah. Wow. That, that, well, that's, that's proof right there that somebody, you know, it couldn't have been any other hacker whatsoever that, you know, put that text file in there to, you know, maybe divert attention away from them and to anonymous. Or it could have been, you know, keep in mind you've got a group that's decentralized and leaderless pretty much. So you can't control it. Everybody who might be associated with it does. I've got more on that in just a moment. Let me, uh, let me get that here. By the way, Sony says they still have yet to identify the individual or individuals that are responsible for the breach. Of course not because, Oh my God, it would be the minute it is identified who did this. And if Sony in any way possible can tie it to anonymous, it's going to be like the headline on every fucking website out there. Like anonymous, not so anonymous anymore. Meet the face of anonymous. You know, it's whoever gets caught with this is going to get drugged through the proverbial street. It is retarded. I mean, cause once again, you're saying that this is a group with no real leadership. Okay. There are people that are leaders or whatever and you know, there are people that are acting on their own on this website or whatever. Well basically it's 4chan. Okay. So let's just not even call it anonymous anymore. It's 4chan. Okay. And then on top of that, if, if you don't have a, if it's not really a group that has any sort of, you know, structure to their membership or anything that anybody can claim membership to it, then you can't even really go after the group. You have to say it's this person that did it because it's not anonymous because not all of them participated in it. It's this one dude that says he's an anonymous. Like if I said I'm in anonymous right now and I kicked Jamie or is she going to go sue anonymous because you know, no, I wouldn't bother suing you. I just punch you in the face. Dude, dark soccer is going to punch anonymous in the face. You know, make sure we poop in your soda or something. It's just, it's, it's dumb is what it is. All right. I need to get some more. Speaking of anonymous, uh, they of course have denied responsibility for this. Yes. Sorry. And I hate bringing up these guys, but um, you may remember back with certain people griefing said podcasts that were part of a certain forum. Yeah. So anonymous was griefing this podcast. That's how retarded Jamie go punch them in the face. So anyways, it's, it's just, all right, look, you can't claim that the group is behind it because there is no group. It's just people that say that they're part of this group. So you'll just find who's behind it. It's people, not a group. All right, look, speaking of anonymous, uh, they did send a statement to the guardian. I'm not, I don't, I mean, I just don't understand how it works. Who sent the statement to the guardian because I didn't think anyone was supposedly in charge, but I guess really there is like a council or something. So there's like, so there's gotta be some type of hierarchy and anonymous because who's sending the letter because otherwise Loki could just send a letter to the guardian thing. Anonymous is official statement is poop, poop, fart, fart, but who's to say that's not the official statement. Evil council, evil council. That's a power reference. Anyway, the statement said public support is not gained by stealing credit card info and personal identities. We are trying to fight criminal activities by corporations and governments, not steal credit cards. If a legitimate and honest investigation into the credit card is conducted, anonymous will not be found liable while we are in a distributed and decentralized group. Our leadership does not condone credit card theft. Poop, poop, fart. I mean, seriously, who's to say that, you know, since it's, but then apparently according to a different report in the financial times, two veteran members of anonymous that I guess the financial times knew, I guess they weren't that anonymous, but somehow they got in touch there saying that some element of that original attack was probably the likely reason. The word likely was involved. And then, uh, according to these veteran members quote, if you say you are anonymous and do something as anonymous, then anonymous did it. Well, regardless, whoever did this, I mean, whoever did this is going to be in a whole lot of trouble if they ever get found out. It's going to be public embarrassment. I mean, at this point, but yeah, if they do, I mean, you know, it's already pretty Sony systems are unhackable. You can't dare dare on their day of, they're prevented against all types of intrusions, right? You know why they can't find any way to hack the systems? Cause they did it with my mind. All this credit cards gone. All right, dark soccer. What do you know? And then I put that text file there so we'll never know it's me. Well, Sony has basically, um, because there's still a wallowing in their own poop like a retarded monkeys, they have decided that, oh, we could do something to help these people maybe. So they are partnering with Debics, D E B I X to give 12 months of identity theft protection for free. Um, also not just a 12 months, but also adding the time that the service was out to. Um, so there should be offers coming out over the next few days with a promotional code for the service and people will have until June 18th to register for it. Um, I'm wondering though, this is going to be some sort of, ooh, do we have to pay for a longer term if we get this as like a free, you know, it better be completely free, no strings attached. That's my thing. That basically is saying that what the all clear ID service is going to have a cyber monitoring and surveillance of the Internet to detect exposure of all clear ID plus customers personal information. Um, a million dollar, um, identity theft insurance policy per user to provide additional protection. In case of all clear, blah, blah, blah, becomes a victim of identity theft. So remember, hackers, you need to wait until till they sign up for it till June 18th, 2012 to do all the stealing of identities. So those bastards aren't covered at all. That'll suck it to him. What you do is you make, okay, hacker people make friends with your victim and then say, okay, I'll hack you and we'll split the money. Yeah, Jamie shame on you. It's just too little too late. Um, and on top of that, you know, identity protection services are really such, I mean this one says, Oh, we'll cover your legal costs and blah, blah, blah. But really all you have to do is go to your bank and your bank covers this shit. You cancel your cards, you know, unless somebody has gone out and done something wholly illegal, like shoot somebody in the face and then leaves your driver's license on them. You know, which I don't see anybody about to go do. Then that's, that's different. And no, don't use that as an idea. I'll leave a card that says anonymous on it when they shoot them in the face and then they'll think that they just right out. We are Legion in their blood. You spell it out with their intros. I think the intestines long enough for that girl. So, uh, you got problems. I do not have problems. I have solutions and I want to know what this is that you linked me. That's supposed to do with Europe. That isn't anything about Europe. Somebody made a mistake in our little show, roll thread and you got the, uh, wrong. Well, apparently they're trying to do the same thing for Europe. The end. And there you go. So can I read this comment from a chair real quick? Amiga seven seven seven in our chat room says like some people on the net say gaming needs a WikiLeaks. I don't know. In theory, that's kind of a neat idea, but I don't know if gaming could the gaming community could handle something as serious as WikiLeaks. Like gaming needs a Perez Hilton. That's what, that's what gaming needs. Something a little more. That's what the, um, our website should do. Draw cocks on people's faces. That would be great. Coconoses on Marcus Phoenix. Let's do it. Loki. Um, yeah, I'm not about to go draw cocks on people's faces unless I put anonymous below it and then you know, they'll think that they drew cocks on people's faces. Ah, yeah. Anyways. Uh, so the PlayStation network supposed to come up this week, but as you know, it's not up this week. What the hell? It's, uh, been delayed because apparently they need further testing. Uh, and says, obviously not coming back this week. And, uh, it says that, you know, uh, based on, you know, this is when we held the press conference in Japan last week, uh, based on what we knew, we expected to have services online within a week. We were unaware of the extent of the attack on Sony online, um, servers and we're taking this opportunity to conduct further testing of the incredibly complex system. I might add the incredibly complex and poorly guarded system. Um, yeah, so it's not coming back this week. Surprise, surprise. And, um, apparently there is some stuff that came out from, to be fair, Loki, I mean, if I'm understanding correctly what exactly Sony is having to do right now, they are basically having to rewrite the entire fucking PlayStation network in two weeks. A process that took months to begin with, right? Am I right? That's kind of what they're doing. They're talking about reconstructing the whole fucking thing from the ground up. See this? It's the tiniest violin playing it for them. I feel so bad for them that they had to create an entirely new database. If only they had known that their database were, um, you know, poorly updated and, uh, just not ready for any sort of hacker attack. Oh, but they did because I legitimately do feel sorry for everybody that's having to work plenty of overtime right now. Probably mandatory overtime trying to fix this situation when it's really not their fault. Well, it's somebody's fault. They made decisions and unfortunately that's the way it works. Yeah, but it's like the grunts are having to pay for the queen bees decision and that's very unfortunate. So I really like this situation will never get better and tell Howard Stringer comes down. You don't like it. You don't work there. That seems pretty simple to me. Anyways, so some information coming out of the house of representatives, energy and commerce subcommittee on the commerce, manufacturing and trade. Wow. That's a long title. Um, according to the breach and this is, I had to laugh at a little bit too because I think from what I heard that it's some guy saying that he read somewhere on a forum, this information, I hope that's not the case, but, uh, apparently they're seeing that Sony had learned several months ago that, um, apparently the PlayStation network was hosted on servers running very old versions of Apache software that were unpatched and had no firewall installed. No firewall. That's awesome. I think that was debunked. I think, uh, uh, some other internet thing looked into it and found that no, there's caches out there that prove that that isn't the case. Okay. So this is just a case of Congress kind of understanding something and further complicating the situation. Exactly. Well, like I even remember reading this and I had to, I had to find it cause I actually read part of maybe the transcript or something like that. They were, they were quoted. Yeah. I had read on a, on a Sony or read on a forum that this was, they literally said, I read this on a forum. You're taking a forum as fact. Awesome. Nothing wrong with that at all. Now, Sony, I read this on a forum and I understand you like mudkips. Can you explain to me, Sony, what is a mudkip? Hey, I read here on another forum fucking Nintendo. It totally told me where the WMDs were in Iraq. Where's WMDs there. This forum said so we need to go right now. Um, they would never be wrong. And then this is great. Apparently there is a rumored third attack planned for Sony. Um, so it says, and this is great. Let's, let's just read through this and laugh at the source. Okay. A group of hackers says that they're playing another wave of cyber attacks against Sony retaliation for its handling of the PlayStation network breach. Because you're mad about the way they're handling this situation. Your plan is to hack them again. Hey, listen, we're going to, we're going to hack you again. So we're in an observer. Wait, wait, hold on. This is great. This is where this is coming from. An observer of an internet relay chat channel used by hackers told Cena. So it's a guy in a chat room that witnessed random people talking. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm holding, I'm waiting. He doesn't yet. Loki. Oh my God. Oh my God. Report the news. Apparently I just hacked Sony. It said so in this internet relay channel. So, um, yes, that, that, that's really credible. That's about one step below forum posts. But, um, Hey, you know, I guess that that's, uh, that's fact. So, um, yeah. Should the plant attack and the tax succeed, it would be the latest blow in the series of devastating tech. That's right. Should this attack a seed? It would be another attack against Sony. Wow. That's great reporting. Uh, in our chat says I have a hankering to watch hackers now. Crash override. Zero. Cool. Angelina Jolie. That's what they should have put in there. They should have put all that stuff like hack the planet and all this crap from the hackers movie. That would have been hilarious. Ah, I can't. All right. All right. Yeah, that's it. We're, we're not going to, I don't. So what now? I mean, that was an exclusive article though. Can I say this though? Cause I read this on Facebook, so I know it's true. And, and you know, you commented on one of Salacious Pop's posts and you said, ah, gamers will forget this in a year. Will they really? I mean, now it's, I realize I say, I've said that on the show before and it's, it's usually pretty true. Like, you know, most people have pretty much forgiven Microsoft for the whole red ring of death thing at this point, you know, and a lot of folks have forgiven other gaming companies for their massive fuckups, but I mean, we're going on date 18 and this could be like literally a month before this is fixed. I mean, we might forget what happened, but will the developers who've now lost a month of sales forget what's happened? And we are getting dangerously close to E3 for Sony. I mean, E3 is less than awesome. Now imagine if PlayStation network is not up by the time that they all, that is awesome. That would be awesome. Granted, the system will probably not awesome for PlayStation or people, but awesome for the press conference. You've seen that GIF on the internet of Michael Jackson eating the popcorn from the thriller video. That's like all of us right now at the, at the press conference for Sony. If, if PlayStation network is not a hundred percent working now, I'm sure at least the multiplayer gaming and all that crap will be back and home will be up and all that. But if the store's not up, I'm saying, which is the hardest part, I think for them to fix, it's going to be interesting. Like the keynote is going to be really weird this year. It's going to be so weird. Like it's just going to be a train wreck, I think. Well, especially if they're going to be talking about like, you know, it's going to be, it's going to overshadow whatever they're showing. And there's some awesome, like the last guardian and shit. Like I want to know more about that. And there's some pretty exciting shit that's supposed to be coming out for PlayStation, especially when they're talking about like, you know, the, in the next PlayStation portable system or whatever, that's going to have like a lot of this, you know, storefront stuff built into it. We'd love to show you it, but uh, you know, hackers and it's down. Yeah, um, I, I, uh, I'm, I'm curious to see how many times and we should have a betting pool on this. Actually, you know what? I have the week off of work. What I would love to do is, yeah, I do. So what we need to do, we need to have a Sony press conference drinking game and we each need to pick a word. And every time we hear that word, we're going to take a shot and my word is going to be secure. So every time we hear the word secure at the PlayStation, E3 press conference, I'm going to take a shot and I'm going to be hacker. I'm going to put like, you know, even odds that I will end up in the hospital at the end of the PlayStation press conference. I pick hacker. Am I trying to kill myself in this or not? I mean, what's, what's what type of, you're trying to kill yourself, trying to kill myself. So what word would you pick to make yourself end up in the hospital? PlayStation. No, you can't pick that dummy. You never said I couldn't find Sony either. And you can't pick NGP or whatever. You're no fun. Oh God, I hate you. All right. Oh, and then of course, finally, uh, Sony there, this is great. There apparently, now I don't know if I should really trust this since it's also from CNET the website that gets their information from people that saw internet relay chats. Um, but apparently they're saying that Sony is waiting in weather to offer a reward for the information on the hackers behind the massive network outage. Um, so they're looking, they're going to put out a reward. It's going to be all Milt Gibson, you know, here's a million dollars. Find them. Give me back my son. Yes, that's exactly what's going to happen. I need you to find these and give me back my son. Uh, also I guess, uh, Sony's denied allegations made in the congressional testimony on Thursday that the servers were not running under the most current security update. Of course, this is the previous network for Sony network entertainment, international and Sony online entertainment use servers that were patched and updated recently and had multiple security measures in place, including firewalls, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um, well, you know what, here's what I have to say about that. It didn't do damn good. It did it. You know, whether you had firewalls up or no firewalls, they still got in. So I don't know, is that even more pathetic that they were updated and ready to go? I mean, at least if they weren't updated, you know, I might say, okay, that's how they got in. But since they were, then how am I going to trust that your brand new network or whatever that you're rebuilding from the ground up is going to be any different than this one since you're, you know, superb security was no match for the hackers. Give me back my son! Ah, yes. Um, actually, I think the reward's a pretty good idea. I think, um, I think the reward, you know, what better way to get all these guys to turn on each other than put a million dollars on the line, right? It's actually a pretty smart move on Sony's part if they do it, if they do it, but we'll see. Uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm so looking forward to the E3 press conference, but anyway, I don't know what else to say about the situation at this point. I feel like there's just, you just like, do you remember the Ricky Lake talk show in the 1990s? Do you remember Ricky Lake? Go Ricky. Do you remember Ricky Lake? Do you remember how like whenever her guests would just get like totally out of control on the stage, she'd just kind of be standing there with a microphone or jaws just all drop. Like I, like that's me right now. I'm out of my element. Exactly. Like I'm just kind of looking at the stage at all these people fighting and Sony and anonymous and the Congress and I'm just looking and I'm just, my mouth just dropped and I'm shaking my head. That's all I've got left to say on the situation. So let's talk about something else. Dark Sakura. Yes. Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. I have one of the things. Sorry. My bad. Whatever it is. It's PlayStation related, but it's not about the hack. Uh, it has to do with PlayStation rewards. Remember this? Well, you may not because it never really happened, but there was a beta program that ended on March 31st and an exclusive t-shirt was sent to the beta testers who got to one of the tiers in this PlayStation rewards loyalty program. And they were sent a thank you card saying, wear it proud. And they, yes, they got a t-shirt from this. Sony literally sent these people a t-shirt that pretty much says I participated in a PlayStation beta and all I got was this lousy t-shirt. That's awesome. Okay. Now Dark Sakura, sorry. Sony you suck. How about something free? Something happy and free and not at all related to Sony. There is a Thor game. It's a 16 bit browser based platformer and it is called, uh, Thor bring the thunder. And, uh, it's basically like Thor, but done Mega Man style. So it looks pretty neat. I think I would want that. And, uh, there actually is a, uh, DS version either out or to be out. This is, yeah, I said May 3rd. I was going to cue my wine. If this is just a 16 bit game, why couldn't like virtual console be used for something like this? But no, that's too, that's too smart. That's that's that would be something new and innovative. I'm sorry. But yeah, I like the idea of at least a free game able to play online that has the rainbow road. I haven't seen the new movie yet. Okay. I hear it's not bad in the comics. Well, I'll go ahead and I'll use ultimate. He summons a freaking rainbow that brings us guardian heroes to earth. He brings the mightiest warriors in the, in all of reality on the rainbow road to kick ass for Norse justice. And I always like, that's very Norse and his level in, um, Marvel versus Capcom three has rainbow road in the background. You know, I think he's really Mario. You know what my favorite part of the Thor movie is though? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That wasn't Thor at all. Actually. I've actually seen part of it, but just for a cameo that makes me super excited. Oh, the whole Avengers tie in thing or something else. But one of my favorite Avengers characters popped up. Okay. Makes me super happy. There you go. All right, moving on. Let's try to give you a clue. It's it's Mel Gibson. All right, let's travel the world and see what games are coming out soon in a gaming store near you and what games you can play to help take your mind off of the, uh, Benny Hill theme song. Uh, this week we've got some, uh, actually a pretty decent selection of titles Lego Pirates of the Caribbean because you know, there's a new Pirates movie and there are Lego Pirates of the Caribbean toys. So it only makes sense that there's Lego Pirates of the Caribbean game. And that's out on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60. We and a DS. There is some online co-op play except if you're on the PlayStation or cause you can't play on the PlayStation network right now. A break coming out on a PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 and a PC this week. Also with online co-op and multiplayer except on the PlayStation three because the PlayStation network is down now. All right, I'll stop. Um, Yu-Gi-Oh fifties world championship 2011 from Konami on Nintendo DS. Um, the first Templar from Calypso on Xbox three 60 and uh, Oh, I guess Lego Pirates was on PSP. How did I forget that? Virtua tennis four on a PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 and the Wii and a dream trigger finally coming out on the three DS. Actually though, now that I've seen gameplay of it, I am not picking that game up. What's dream trigger all about? It was a music, um, kind of shoot him up game. Um, but it was really weird looking. It's, I thought it was going to be kinda like rez, but it's not. It's like, um, you have to tap the screen on the bottom and it creates like a little radar thing and you see enemies. You have to go, Hey, not my thing. Um, if it was like rez. Well, I'm taking a peek at a little, uh, pretty bad ass trailer here that's on the YouTube. As you can see here, there are some shut up. I don't want to hear this guy. Last but not least, MX versus ATV alive coming out, um, from THQ on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60. And of course this is one of the first games that THQ is experimenting with their lower price games. So it's only $40 retail and they're going to have a download content every two weeks. So you know, Hey, if you want to kind of support that type of thing and try to maybe get the prices of games down, then that'd be the way to go. So, um, and I hear it's supposed to be pretty good and that's it for this week. See, I'm looking at, I found a working where some dude isn't talking over it. Hold on. I really hate sometimes that literally anyone can upload things to YouTube because I hate the people that just take like someone else's YouTube and then do their own thing over it. Like, Oh, you heard taste me. Hold on. Okay. So, uh, dream trigger. The next generation of handheld shooters is here. Mind warping 3D. Over 50 levels. Collectible trophies in multiplayer. Wait, trophies on a 3DS game. Hold on. It seems like on the bottom screen, you have to tap it and you see where the enemies are on the top screen and then you have to shoot them. Weird. I mean, it might be cool, but it's just, you know, I've already gotten three 3DS games that I don't play and so I don't really need to add a fourth to it. So, you know, I'll just, I'll wait until, you know, I'll tell you what D3, you know, cause they're the publisher of that game. You really want me to get the, you know, play a game on the 3DS. You'll portal over earth defense for us cause that would be awesome. At least bring the PSP version of her. You know what? I'll get my PSP working again for that. All right, let's travel to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates. This week on the Xbox 360 major league baseball 2K11 comes out on May 12th. I should point this out. Portal two is out next week and I wonder if that's a localization of the game. Like if they've actually redone the voice acting and so forth. I don't know. It's in a lot of languages. Let me put it that way. Okay, well maybe, maybe it's just the same version we have here. It's just finally getting its Japanese release. I don't know, but I just, I wonder what GLaDOS sounds like in Japanese. That's all. That's all I want to know, but that's next week. To give her like an old, you know, Japanese man voice or whatever. On the PlayStation 3 major league baseball 2K11 is out there as well as Suzumiya Harui no Suyasu comes out this week. It's Haruhi. It's the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oh yeah, this is the same anime manga universe. So this is a game coming out on PS3 this week. A whole game about that series. There's also a box edition, a special box edition on that if you want to get that if you're a big fan of the anime. On the Nintendo Wii, nothing. On the 3DS, Steel Diver is out this week in Japan. Of course that was a launch game for us here, but they're just now getting that in Japan. And lastly on the PSP, Planetarian Shisana Hoshi no Yume. That's a charity edition. I'm not sure what that means. If that's a price reduction or something where the money goes to charity. I don't have any translation on this, but it does look like the game is kind of one of those like cyber anime space robot things. And also another version of Suzumiya Harui is coming out there on the PSP as well. And lastly, Makai Senki Disgaea 2 Portable, of course Disgaea 2. Getting a price reduction this week on the PSP in Japan and moves into the best series. There you go. There's your Japanese releases. How about the UK? We do have a few things for the UK. Let me look at my calendar because it's going to be another week. Oh finals week. Shoot me. Okay. We have on the ninth, Hydrophobia Prophecy and on the 11th, Alads Online. And then on the 13th, we've got a few things. We have Brink, Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, and that's it. Alright. Just a few more stories for you guys. Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week. But first. Yes. So apparently though, I kind of think I know what this is. Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver is working on a core Kinect shooter game. And you know, there's been rumors for a while now that they're going to be doing a Kinect Halo game. That's probably this. They're saying that the studio's mission is to push the limits of the proven and unexplored game development and show the world what's possible with Microsoft game consoles. That's pretty generic sounding. But if I were to bet money, I would say it's probably going to be a Kinect Halo game. You think? Yeah. Although. There were the rumors before about that anyway, so. It would be cool if it was something original. Or you know, they want to be really cool. Not necessarily I'd want a Kinect version of this, but Timesplitters isn't getting a lot of love lately. I really love a new Timesplitters game. Just saying. Alright. One other story for you guys. This is another big rumor that's popped up this week, and a lot of people kind of ignored it because of everything that's going on with the Playstation. And honestly, this is probably something that deserved to be ignored. But apparently, development kits for a brand new Microsoft consoles were in the offices of one of EA Studios. This is according to a source. They don't work for EA or Microsoft, but they did say that it came in a PC shell and it was shipped to EA last month. I guess there's been rumors already about Xbox 360 dev kits, and this was set to sort of dispel that rumor or what have you. I don't know. So of course, people are now speculating, is Microsoft set to reveal a new console at E3? Well, EA's director of corporate communications came out and said in a statement to IGN that that story was, quote, a total fabrication. It is 100% not true. And, you know, I absolutely no way is there a Microsoft console being shown at E3 this year. I would bet a large sum of money on that. Why? Because Kinect has not lived out its full potential yet. Microsoft's invested a lot in Kinect. Kinect is still, what's that record? It has the best selling electronic gadget like ever, or fastest selling, I think, electronic gadget ever, like more so than the iPhone. It's been crazy popular for them, but yet that hasn't really reached his full potential. And they're on a 10 year console cycle. They've been stressing that, and that's the whole plan with the Kinect anyway. Yeah, but Nintendo got away with not doing that. But of course, Nintendo never said it was going to be a 10 year cycle for them. Yeah, they never did. So, you know, whatever. But I just, no way are you going to see a new, I mean, of course you might see maybe a redesigned 360 or a 360 with Kinect built in. I don't know, you might see something like that, but I doubt it. I think it's going to be just more Kinect support, and now it's not going to be so much about the dance games, the biggest loser workout games, and those things. Now you're going to see the next wave of quote unquote hardcore Kinect games, such as this rumored Halo reimagining that's going to be done with Kinect. I think that's what E3 is all about this year. Now how do we take Kinect to the next, like how do we make Kinect not so gimmicky? Because you haven't seen just make it not gimmicky. I mean, that's it. I mean, what you need to do is, yeah, you realize that you can do just because you can do something with the hardware doesn't mean you should do something with the hardware. Like I don't before, you know, head tracking. That's all you need to like for I don't understand why that's not even available for most first person shooters nowadays is just have that support in there. OK, it does a little bit of head tracking if you want to. That's it. That's all you have to add. I mean, if you want to make it so you can throw a grenade by swinging your arms and cool, but it's not really necessary because it takes a lot more time to swing my arm in a grenade motion than it would to push a button. Yeah, so yeah, I just, you know, I think it's going to be all about maybe this head tracking or whatever else technologies are going to put in future games. That's what you're going to see at E3 this year. And of course, Dance Central 2, you know, and sequels to the popular wave of first titles. But really, what Kinect releases have we seen since Christmas until now? Very, very little. I mean, especially that's not budget knockoff titles. Now granted, Child of Eden is kind of your lone standout point. But that's not a Kinect only game. That's a game that has Kinect support. That's OK. I still would consider that a Kinect title. OK, well, since Christmas, here's what we've had. We've had Dance Paradise, which was a terrible dancing game from THQ. We had the Michael Jackson Experience, which was kind of like Just Dance and a karaoke game. We've had Fantastic Pets, which was a THQ pet sim game that, you know, it's kind of dumb. And every game you've named so far is a derivative of one of the Christmas games. We've had... We've got two Dance Centrals and Kinectimals. I'm trying to think what else we've had. Kung Fu Panda 2, that's going to be a Kinect game. Michael Phelps, Push the Limit, that's coming out in June. Whoopee. It's a swimming game. Nothing, nothing, I mean, you're stretching to think of things. I mean, there's nothing that just jumps out at you as like an OMG must own title. Right? I mean, all these are just little flashes in the pan because there's nothing else on Kinect right now and people are hoping that they'll buy this crazy shit. You know, people that crave new dance games are going to buy this Dance Paradise or what have you. Dance Paradise is terrible. Don't buy Dance Paradise. How does it work? Dance Paradise, it has your avatars in it, for one. So that's how you know that they're not taking the damn thing seriously. Two, it's basically, it's got this interface that looks terrible. You're standing, these kind of outlines of a person are kind of sliding towards you down this. Kind of think of it like that Hole in the Wall show or something like that where you have to move, make a certain gesture or something like that. Isn't that kind of how Dance Masters works too? Sort of. But Dance Masters is less, you don't really know what's coming up. I don't know. It's an interesting idea, but it's really way too Japanese-skewed Dance Masters, that's for sure. But, yeah, there's not a lot out there. People are looking for stuff. It's just, sadly, Michael Jackson Experience is actually probably the best title out of the bunch so far. Because, I mean, it's got Just Dance as the core to it, because that's basically what the game's built off of. But, I mean, I'd wait for chat. Some people in chat are kind of knocking on it, actually. Kaijuto says, Michael Jackson Inexperience, I call it, DDR dollar bill. I was pissed at the experience, not from the dance moves, but from being forced, quote unquote, to sing. Those comments from our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. How can you be forced to sing? The Kinect has a microphone in it. That does suck. Alright. You should be able to turn that off. Going back to the original story, though, about the whole dev kit, actually, you know what's funny? I don't doubt that there actually is a dev kit already at EA. I mean, if they are going to announce something next year, which I'd see is a lot more viable, or maybe the year after, I mean, EA is one of the big, EA and Activision is probably your two biggest publishers, probably have to already be thinking about what launch titles they want to make for it. These games don't take two seconds to develop. They're going to take some time. So, I actually don't doubt that they're there. Of course these systems are already under development. You know, I bet EA has a pretty good idea what to expect, but you're not going to see it this year. Well, of course not, because, I mean, if anything, these are like alpha kits or something like that, because, you know, let's say that they're sticking to the 10-year console cycle, okay? Well, the 360 was out in 05, and, I mean, the way prices are coming down on all electronic stuff, you know, God knows what technology is going to be in five years, or four years, I guess. Almost five years. I mean, that stuff comes down in price so much, I mean, if they're like building it off of specs right now, like say, okay, we're going to have a gig of RAM in there or something like that, well, five years, you might be able to afford 16 gigs of RAM for the price of that. Honestly, though, a lot of this depends on how much Nintendo ups the Ani with what they're doing, because if they are hugely successful and they've upped the Ani past the specs that 360 and PlayStation 3 has, it's going to force the other two to work faster. Yeah, but I don't know if that's even going to be a big deal. I mean, they're going to have a little bit of an advantage of being first out there, but it's all about how they grasp and use it, but if they're just going to be like, well, we're out here first, so we're just going to kick on back, because we don't have to worry about competition. But here's the thing, though, they've got to be way ahead of the game, because if it's just making it just a hair better than PlayStation 3 or 360, it's all going to be gameplay then, and if they can't bring that to the table, then eh. But I don't think gameplay's a problem for them, because before, they've all focused on gameplay, and graphics have kind of taken a back seat, so if they bring all the visuals and audio and stuff up to snuff, then they have a pretty good system there. But they also can't play their games that they've been playing recently, where it's just like, oh, let's re-release this. Oh, let's make the graphics on this slightly better and re-release it again. Oh, hey, here's another game that's just like this other game. Oh, hey, look, it's another Animal Crossing with the exact same stuff in it. Oh, we'll see, we'll see. Alright, let's move on, we've got to get to the classic game of the week. Every week here on Orange Launch Radio, DarkSakura takes a stroll to the classic gaming vault and digs in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game. You know, there's no network, none of your newfangled networks right now to play things on anyway. Except XBox Live. So you should go back and revisit this classic game. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week? The classic game of the week is Phantasmagoria. Which was a weird ass game. Let's do some clips here if I can get to the point. I picked one that like had some music, but then it went right into more talking. Anyway, Phantasmagoria was on seven CD-ROMs for the PC and it was released in 1995, which was when I first played it. I was my second year, no, my first full year of college. So it was, it took a lot of time. I should have been studying. But anyway, it was one of the interactive movie type games right in the height of the whole deal. And it used a live actress who her name was a Victoria Morsell, which does sound kind of like a porn name, doesn't it? Miss Morsell, will you please bend over for the camera? It makes me think of dark shadows. My name is Victoria Winters. At any rate, like I said, it was on seven CD's because it was a lot of video, a ton of video. And actually most of it was filmed in front of a blue screen. There was something like several hundred different actions that the actress who is the main character in the show, well not in the show, in the game, had to do, you know, like walking to a night and picking something up, doing something. And also it had 550 pages of a script, which is about four times the size of a regular movie script and an additional hundred pages of storyboards for the 800 scenes in the game. It took four months of filming and 200 people were involved in the productions. That's also including, that's actually not including, sorry, the 135 people who were in the Gregorian choir for part of the music. And the last scene took a week to film. But anyway, it was developed by Roberta Williams, who is, she's actually behind King's Quest. And it was one of the goriest and most violent games to come out in its time. I mean, it's got an M rating now. It had... Can I look at some of these death scene YouTubes? I want to see how gory this game is. Okay. Let's see here. I want to see some of this here. Let's put it up. Yep. So she's walking in front of like this mirror that's doing a little swirly gas thing. Can I give you a special feast, Regina? Oh, that's one of the murders. Ew, he's like shoving all these organs in this chick's mouth and like forcing her to eat them. This game's nasty. Basically the story, the main character is Adrian and her husband, Gordon. And she's a paperback writer and he is a photographer. So they buy this mansion that's owned by a 19th century magician named Zoltan Carnavash. And so basically through the course of the thing, she accidentally releases this demon that had possessed basically Carno, the illusionist, and it possesses her husband. So he goes on this big spree of being abusive. He rapes her in one scene and then he gets more and more possessed and starts killing people. And it turns out that this guy killed five of his wives. He had five wives and he killed them based on how they were in life. Like one of them was into gardening so he suffocated her with mulch and stabbed her with gardening tools. There was another one who was an alcoholic so he shoved her in the eye with a wine bottle. There was a talkative one so he gagged her and then broke her neck. And then this one... Oh my God. Oh my God, this demon just put his hands in the chick's eyes and pulled her face in half. This game's nasty. But she liked food and so he force fed her animal entrails until she took to death. So his last wife realizes that he's a murderer so she and her lover try to kill him except he comes back and kills them but they kill him again and then they all die. So I don't know. Anyway, it's a lot of gore, a lot of really violent themes and pretty, pretty hardcore stuff. And you're sick if you like this. This is so gross, Jamie. This is a gross game. The reason why I'm bringing it up is because at that time it was really novel for its time. It was really pushing the envelope. Fucked up? How about fucked up? No, that's a good word. It was really fucked up. But for when it came out in 95 there weren't too many other games. I mean, basically you had Myst. It really did kind of push the envelope and I think it's one of... I'd have to put it in... Grand Theft Auto is nothing compared to that. Grand Theft Auto is my little pony. It's an angel food cake made with whipped cream. I mean... I agree with Dungeon Buster in the chat room. Fair to believe that King's Quest Williams did this. Clearly she had a dark side after all those games about fucking fairytales. She's like, I can't take it anymore, gore! More blood! More blood! Well, it also did get a sequel in 96 called Phantasmagoria, a Puzzle of Flesh. Great name, huh? And you know, this actually came out in Japan for the sake of Saturn. And it was completely re-dubbed in Japanese. It came out in 8 CDs. And it was released by Outtrigger in 97 and it was just called Phantasm there. And Roberta Williams was asked by Sierra to do a third game, but nothing happened. And she actually said that Phantasmagoria is the game most representative of her game design career. And there was a box set of both called Phantasmagoria Stage Fright in 1995. And actually it just got re-released by Good Old Games in February last year as a digital download. I've actually been totally considering because... So yeah, if you want to, if you want, if you, if you're a sick person, you want to see this sick game, you can go... Oh, that's the final... Check it out. Scene 2. Oh, this is like OMG Spoilers? Oh yeah, she, she... It was just labeled as another death scene. Oh no. Uh oh. Oh my God! Gross! That's if you fail that. That blade chopped her head in half. Yeah, but she uses it to kill him instead in the actual ending. Sick people. It's, it's a really, really violent, bloody, gory game. But like I said, it was really one that pushed the envelope in those days. A lot went into it. And for what it is, it's a pretty good game. So now I wouldn't say it's too hard of a game. I mean with the puzzles, but it was pretty good. I remember playing it when I was a lot younger and I'm really glad I wasn't very good at it because I never got to any of this stuff. I remember playing the game. I borrowed it from my friend, but I was like, I don't get this. I can't play this. So I never got to any of like the really gory stuff. So I'm kind of glad because this is sick. Yeah. Pornography. But it, it needed to be mentioned. All right. It is, it is one of those classics. All right. Uh, that's going to do it for a part eight of our show, but don't go anywhere guys. We're going to be right back with plenty more of orange lounge radio. We got more stuff coming up in part B. We're gonna talk a little bit about some of the pre E3 stuff that's going on. Uh, some news about Nintendo as well. Lots of stuff, a little bit more. Wow. Cause the Warcraft did something important this week. We want to share, uh, the mailbag as well. FUs of the week, your calls and tonight a list list. So we'll take the topic. We'll get back with part B right here with more of orange lounge radio. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio. We are live with episode number 412. We're coming into part B. We've of course talked quite a bit about the whole PlayStation debacle in part A. Uh, we're going to have a little fun with it here in part B tonight. We're going to do some rapid fire news, some Twitter topics. You want to get those in real quick and then a little later on we're going to get into tonight's list list, which of course we have to poke fun at what's going on with PlayStation network thing. PlayStation network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. So we'll uh, be playing that game in just a little while. We'll tell you a little more about listless and how that works if you've never heard it before. Uh, first we want to get back into the show. Uh, I want to do some quick plugs though for the other projects that we work on dark soccer. It's comic insanity and it's back. We recorded today. Yay. And um, we, uh, go, uh, I'm stuck at promos today. We are on infamous.net and F A M O U S dot net and you can download us every Tuesday where we talk about comic books and whether or not we care about them and other geek worthy news. Awesome. It's me and Marin Marvel and Dan shadow and we're awesome. Um, I want to also give a plug for my show. It's called Horde House, the best little Horde house in Azeroth and it's about all things were the Warcraft. So if the Warcraft chat earlier in this show just wasn't enough for you, there's plenty more that happens with myself and extra for an extra for is very, very explicit. He's more explicit than phantasmagoria, but with Dick jokes instead of blood. Extra for is the guy who originated the term bleached asshole. Yes. Well, I don't know if he originated that. I believe a stripper somewhere originated that, but he made it famous. Exactly. A horde house.com H O R D E H O U S E dot com. A couple other plugs I was asked to give here. Rama said, please plug anime jam session. And I said, sure. Visit our friends at anime jam session. You visit their website, anime jam session.com. Anime video games, cons, cosplay, everything in between. Just throw it all in a blender and there you go. Anime jam session. Although it, it sounds a lot better. Trust me, it's, it's actually pretty cool. So check that out. They've got a fun little show there. Also, um, my buddy say joined chat and one of the big things he works on every year is OOM loud, OOM loud. It's very loud. It's a, uh, a child's play fundraiser. Uh, it is rock band all night long and it has a date for this year, December 8th. Now I missed it last year and I was pissed, but you know, real life happens sometimes. Uh, but I'm really trying to make it this year and uh, I hope you guys can make it too. Book your flights now. It's going to be fun. December 8th. Uh, of course it was same, same place. DNA lounge, same city, San Francisco, California, but more rock. All right. Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news and uh, go around and do some quick stories and then we'll get to the tweets, twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, this is kind of unique. Um, of course with the new rock star game, LA noir coming out next week, they're kind of, um, I don't know, tying this in with the release of that. They have some collected stories that they're releasing on a, an ebook format and you can check it out. It's basically, uh, an anthology, um, of collected, uh, Hollywood tales from authors like a Megan Abbott, Joyce Carol Oates and Jonathan, uh, central for, I don't read books, so don't know who these are. But, um, apparently though, I guess they're going to be kind of like 19, I mean 1940s noir detective novels. So that's kind of cool. And uh, the first one, of course they have a little sample you can check out of, um, the, uh, the girl, which is, uh, Megan Abbott's book. That's going to be the first one coming out and you check that out on a rock stars website, rockstargames.com slash LA noir, um, slash features slash stories and they'll be right there. And a pretty cool, uh, idea, I guess they're going to have, I guess eight total. Um, and I'm definitely checking out that game when that comes out next week. And then this is also pretty cool. Uh, with a copy of battle LA on Blu-ray, you can also get an early access to the resistance three demo that'll be on the disc. Uh, the demo will be a 30 minute demo that was, I believe shown off, um, earlier this year. Um, I guess back in March they were showing some of that stuff off and, uh, the game looks pretty awesome and you know, it kind of ties in with battle LA since, you know, you're battling aliens in the United States and stuff like that. Um, so if you really want to check out that and maybe you just want to buy the movie cause I hear the movie's decent, you know, um, that'd be the way to go. So, uh, that's coming out June 14th and I actually probably will pick that up cause, uh, watching, I mean, I have to pick it up and make it for free cause I'm lucky like that. Um, and then, I love Volition and, uh, their Saints Row and Red Faction games. I actually haven't played too much of Red Faction, but I really should. But Saints Row, I mean, it, they're just very over the top with everything. I don't know if you guys remember from Armageddon, um, or, uh, Armageddon, uh, Guerrilla last year they had a, uh, April Fool's weapon that they released that actually became a real weapon that was an ostrich. It was, uh, a melee weapon that you hit people with an ostrich and that was pretty awesome. Um, well now they have, uh, the new weapon which is called Mr. Toots. It is a unicorn with, it looks like, you know, My Little Pony or something like that, that you pull on its tail and it shoots a rainbow out of its ass that makes people explode. Just awesome. That was in a video that the guy who did the portal video did where he gets a portal gun and his friends will care. Yeah, well, that was tying in with this, of course. Um, and, uh, Mr. Toots, of course, is, um, isn't going to be available right away. It will be available though if a million people download the demo that is available right now. So, after one million downloads of the Red Faction Armageddon demo, Mr. Toots will be unleashed for all to use. And that is awesome. You know what? I gotta say, with, uh, a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of its ass, they're really gonna have to step up their game for, you know, Postal 3. Cause I'm sorry, a chainsaw badger? I ain't cutting it anymore. Now a chainsaw honey badger. They've gotta make a game based on honey badger at this point. It was already angry, er, Naughty Bear. They could do pissed off honey badger. Sorry, they need to make a good game based off of honey badger. Alright, uh... Naughty Bear was a terrible game, by the way. Yeah, the iPhone one is pretty bad too. Okay, anyway, other tweets, er, I'm sorry, not tweets yet. We're almost to tweets, but other rapid fire news. Uh, this game, apparently it's a rhythm game. For those of you kids that like your rhythm based games, uh, there's a new game coming out called Pulse Volume 1. Uh, this is a game for the iPad. And I guess what this is, it's stationary rings that are in the center of the screen. Each ring is larger than the last with the smallest set in the center. And then the number of rings increase with each difficulty level. Now as a pulse ring grows outward from the center, orbs follow along the stationary rings. And as the music plays, pulse rings appear and reach the orbs to the beat of the song. Scoring is based on the accuracy of orbs hit in correlation with the pulse reaching them. Hmm, this could be interesting. So here's a little bit of the gameplay. You can kinda hear what some of the music sounds like. You can see, it's kinda neat. Like, each pulse is kinda like one measure in the song and you gotta tap all the little lines. It's kinda like, I don't know, elite beat agents meets a map of the solar system. There you go. That's Pulse. Uh, some news from Harmonix. Uh, stories about the, uh, Rock Band download content and where they're at, uh, after the post MTV Games breakup. Uh, a quote from, uh, Chris Rigopoulos, who is the Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. Uh, he was interviewed by Game Informer saying that, quote, they've effectively severed all ties with MTV and all proceeds from Rock Band belong to Harmonix. Now this is important because many people thought that, well, the reason why they were getting such awesome download content to begin with was because of their partnership with MTV Games. Now, he continues to say that it has been a collaborative effort between Harmonix and MTV in the past. Uh, all the stuff you've seen this year so far, most of that was before Harmonix was sold by Viacom. Now, the new tracks that'll be coming out soon, that's gonna give you the first glimpse at some of the music that the company has secured without MTV. And I think Jamie's gonna cover that in a minute. And it still sounds pretty good stuff, but I love this. Uh, he doesn't expect that there's gonna be any drastic changes to the music selection process, but, quote, I doubt you will see any more SpongeBob SquarePants packs. Ouch. So I guess that was not something they wanted to do, but they did anyway. Well, yeah, that makes sense, you know. Viacom, you know, I think it's Nintendo, or not Nintendo, Nickelodeon, MTV, yeah. Uh, also, speaking of Rock Band, this is very important, there will be no Rock Band 4 this year. Yeah, I'm not surprised. Uh, yeah, kind of file that under duh. I mean, it took a couple years for Rock Band 3, uh, but they are not gonna be doing a Rock Band 4 this year, and I'm kinda not surprised because, you know, Guitar Heroes on hiatus, Rock Band 3 unfortunately didn't sell well, and it's, it's a bummer because it's a great title. It's down to 10 bucks at Toys R Us now. It's, honestly, you're, if you like music games in the slightest, you've gotta get Rock Band 3, it's awesome. So take advantage of the $10 sale, I suppose, uh, and go check that out. Uh, probably this year's at E3 you're gonna see more from Harmonix, like Dance Central 2 will probably be their big title. Maybe something unannounced, who knows? Uh, maybe something to take on a different type of music game. We'll see, you know, there's always been that rumor that they want to review and revisit the amplitude frequency type of games. That could always be something they show. Got a DJ game would be awesome. We'll see. So, but, uh, no Rock Band 4. Maybe next year or the year after that when people are back into music games. I would say it's gonna take until whenever the next series of systems comes out, but we'll see. Dark Sakura. There is a PS3 bundle coming out for Black Ops in three weeks. Um, Call of Duty Black Ops will have one that has 100, that, uh, excuse me. It's, let me start over. There is a PS3 bundle with Black Ops arriving. It's Call of Duty Black Ops on PS3. It will have 160 gigabyte hard drive and will be 300 bucks. And, uh, hopefully we will hear something from Activision and Sony soon, but this is still just, uh, coming from retail. 100% true. Okay. Super Meat Boy level editor is out. Yay. So you can go and, uh, download it. It's on Steam. Make some levels, share them with everybody. And they better not suck. And in the... They'll all be hard as hell. You know, cause people... Aren't all the levels hard as hell? In Super Meat Boy, yeah. Well, there is a, of course, another Rock Band pack coming out, uh, this month here in May. There will be tracks from, uh, the Foo Fighters album, uh, Wasting Light. And then, uh, there will be pro guitar and bass upgrades to older Rock Band tracks. There will also, um, be, uh, some Lady Gaga. Are you happy, Rob? Absolutely. Cause you know I'll be singing that in the privacy of my own home. And Peter Frampton. I live with someone now. Oh well, they can deal. It's Do You Feel Like We Do, which is from Frampton Comes Alive, which my former stepfather had that album. I love that they have from Lady Gaga to Peter fucking Frampton. Oh, and Ozzy. There will be Ozzy. You know what? I want some damn Lita Ford. I want the Ozzy Lita Ford duet. Close My Eyes Forever. I love that song. You know what I would like to see in Rock Band, especially now that they have piano? Meat Loaf. Yes. Yes. We need the Rocky down like that. Well, they did have some Meat Loaf. I thought, like, around Valentine's Day they had some Meat Loaf stuff. Oh my god, maybe I missed it. I think there's, um... I'm checking the list of Rock Band downloads now. I know that there's a couple of, uh... In fact, you were excited about one. I wanna say. This is important information. I need to know what Meat Loaf songs are available. This will complete Rob's life. It really will. Just do a search. Control F Meat Loaf. Or I could just alphabetize the list and then scroll down to M. H I J K. I'm gonna say F. There's Megadeth, Megadeth, More Megadeth, Screwed. Oh, one Meat Loaf song. One Meat Loaf song. Paradise by the Dashboard Light. Cause you were giddy about that. That's not enough Meat Loaf. There's always room for Meat Loaf. Meat Bat Out of Hell. Wouldn't it be great if we had the Rocky Download Pack? I thought there was a Rocky song in Rock Band. No, it was in Guitar Hero. There's, uh... I think there's songs in Guitar Hero, but I don't have Guitar Hero. We need the whole thing for Rock Band. That would be great. That would be awesome. And we need the trumpet. We need the saxophone controller next. Alright, any more news? No. Alright, well if there is, I don't care. Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics then. Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r because of course this is the show where every gamer has a voice. Let's go to the first tweet tonight from uh... we already covered that story. So we'll go to M. N. Zeba. Ooh, I remember reading about this too. M. N. Zeba tweeted us saying, the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword GDC 2011 trailer music played backwards is very familiar. So apparently... It wasn't to me. A person who, you know, I'll let you get into that. Alright, so here it is, played backwards. And this is backwards right now. Now, that's a little tune from Ocarina, right? Is that why? Yes, I did. People were flipping their shit about this? Yeah. Once again though, me not really giving a crap about Ocarina of Time, that was totally lost to me. I was like... But it's this whole setup because we have the Ocarina of Time re-release coming out first. Eh, big deal. Alright, well that was a tweet from M. N. Zeba. Alright, Blue Swim tweet says, rumor has it that Namco Bandai Games America has licensed Sailor Moon? And he tweets us to a site that he actually works for. But I'm assuming he's going on good authority. Oh, I see. Sailor Moon World Italy apparently is the source here. Some new companies have evolved, acquired licenses for Sailor Moon and one of them is Namco Bandai Games America. Oh boy, I hope we get a Kinect Sailor Moon game that we can do the transformation. Dark Sakura, would you play that? Maybe. I'm not that acrobatic. You know you would. Alright, Silver Sonic tweets us to a story about, what else, Sonic. Sonic Generations rumor coming to Nintendo 3DS. A portable version of Sonic Generations coming to the 3DS. Apparently it's from a GameStop report that shows upcoming skews and it's listed for the very end of the year, a placeholder end of 2011 date. So there you go. So some folks are yelling at me in chat that I didn't go through the whole video. Well what am I going to see if I go through the whole video? Alright, tell me what I'm going to see and then I'll go back to the whole video. Alright, going to DJ Rama S tweets us saying, IGN acquires UGO. No one, Ker. No one, Ker. Great, the corporate collective grows bigger. Congrats. Now they own 1UP and IGN. Yep. Congrats. Yep. Alright, let's see, Tiger Claw links us to a few stories here. Valve is starting to look at Steam Mobile. Oh that would be kind of neat. Like a mobile based Steam store. I'm assuming that can't really compete with the iPhone. I mean, excuse me, it would compete with the iPhone but it can't be on the iPhone I suppose. Or maybe it could. I guess you could always do something like that because if you sold it through the Apple store and then it could have the add-ons, I don't know. But I don't know if that's what Valve would do. Anyway, Valve is saying that they're looking at the possibility of bringing Steam to mobile devices. According to this story, it's from Trademag MCV and I guess it's something that the Valve marketing vice president Doug Lombardi says that the more requests that Valve receives for a mobile version of the platform, the more likely it is to act. We'll see what happens with that. At least you know you get some hella good sales on that. All right, let's see. Tiger Claw 305 also links us to Smithsonian announces lineup for art of video games exhibit. Oh that's kind of cool. That's right, the Smithsonian was supposed to be doing something with that. So it's running from March 16th of next year through September 30th and yeah, that's pretty awesome. So the Smithsonian, which is funny because remember that whole video games aren't art debate that went on a couple years ago. Well now they're going to show video game art in the Smithsonian. So I don't know. I think that kind of ends that argument. By the way, there's a quote here that sells the exhibition quote. Video games use images, actions, and player participation to tell stories and engage their audiences in the same way as film, animation, and performance. They can be considered a compelling and influential form of narrative arts. New technologies have allowed designers to create increasingly interactive and sophisticated game environments while staying grounded in traditional game types. The exhibition will feature 80 games through still images and video footage. There will be five playable games in the exhibit. Pac-Man, Super Mario Brothers, The Secret of Monkey Island, Myst, and World of Warcraft. There will also be video interviews with notable game developers, large prints of screenshots, antique consoles, 3.7 million votes cast in a poll over 175 countries. There's 80 games in the exhibit including Zelda, Donkey Kong, Doom 2, but there are some missing. This article calls out Space Harrier and Beyond Good and Evil. But you know what? When there's only 80 games, sadly some good ones are probably going to be lost by the wayside. All right. A few more tweets for you guys here. JV Mon tweets us about Thomas Howard. Remember Thomas Howard Lichtenstein, I think his name is, of DDR fame. Remember that? Apparently, it's a song with Disco Warp. They were in DDR universe and this is some type of indie band collaboration here. I guess they're all straight out of Portland. So here's the song. Oh my gosh. There's too much noise in that song. There's just too much noise. I'm just picturing a lot of 13 year olds at a rave now. So where's Thomas Howard coming to that? I imagine he sings at some point, but I don't know if I can get to that point. I'm not saying a song is bad, but I'm just saying it's a lot of new. Maybe the middle is a little bit different. Oh, is it the wrong song? Oh, JV Mon said I played the wrong song. My bad. Well, I clicked the link you sent me. All right, here we go. Let's try this one instead. Is that like the anti-auto tune? Why? Why did they do that? It's okay. Too many effects. You don't need it. That was better than the first song, but yeah, it's just, uh, don't need all the effects on there, buddy. All right. Uh, let's see. Last tweet here from Salacious Pop. Jack's beef jerky, ew, uh, is running promos for Xbox live arcade and Hulu plus. I got three months gold for 1295 and a month of Hulu plus for free. Any thoughts? Okay. First off Hulu plus is, it sucks because you're paying to watch commercials and I don't like that at all. I mean, yes, they have a big archive of shows, but you know, so does Netflix and I think there's plenty of stuff to watch on there and the internet. Uh, also the other thing to keep in mind, the Hulu plus interface on Xbox fucking blows because they've done that whole crossbar thing with Hulu plus and it doesn't work. The crossbar thing does not work for everything and Hulu plus and Facebook and Twitter and all this other stuff they try to integrate next, but that crossbar thing does not work for it. Uh, so yeah, I guess you can set up a queue online to do Hulu plus and that's kinda, I guess the way you're supposed to do it. But did you know that a lot of the stuff you can watch on the web, you can't watch on your Xbox. It's not licensed for playback on the Xbox. No more reason why Hulu plus is kind of dumb. Sorry. Um, or yes, or you could set up your queue and then download diversity. Of course you have to buy diversity I suppose, but you can download, I'm sure a streaming program and link it with that and you can actually stream all that stuff through there. Uh, some comments in our chatroom at chat.orns lounge radio.com. Uh, Black Wolf says you have to give your credit card to get the free month. Oh, uh, break man says I like Hulu pluses TV selection, but the movie selection sucks. Salacious pop clarifies the biggest draw to Hulu plus is that they let you watch shows on demand that are still current from just last week, et cetera. You know how else you can watch shows that are still current Torrance or, or most of them are on like cbs.com has most of the CBS shows and NBC. Most of them are available that way, but like the real, real stuff like HBO, like if you want to watch, I don't know what the tutors or any of that showtime. We just got HBO actually because we have upgraded our Comcast, whatever, because they're going to give us the same thing. Plus our phone for the same price we had already, but they gave us, they give us a Gaga concert last night. Yeah, that's the thing though. They gave us HBO, but it doesn't work because we were, we're like, okay, what should we watch? Oh God concert. Okay, well we don't have anything else to watch. So we clicked on that. This channel is not available like, but they were supposed to give it to us for free for three months. So great. There's something else that's wrong with Comcast. Hooray. But Hey, we have a DVR now. So that's in our chat room says, or you could watch it on the TV. If you want to watch a current show, you could turn on your TV and watch it. That's a good point. We caught up on the office lesson instead. I watched survivor live every week. I don't have a DVR anymore. I don't record shows. So if I don't watch it live, I'm either watching it on cbs.com or Netflix or Hulu.com the free version or something. Torrance are great. Or if you want to get into this century with the piracy, um, use net or, you know, the file share sites are way better and faster. By the way, I think I should be on survivor because like, seriously, this season is driving me bonkers because there's all these bimbos on that show that are totally being controlled right now. I can't stand it. I'm just saying if I went on that show, I'd be the one in charge. Bitches better watch it. That's right. Watch it. That's it for tweets, twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, let's move on to some more news. Listless coming up in just a moment, but first a round of stories. Yeah. Um, so Kami's planning this sort of party or I don't know. Um, they're doing a pre E3 show on June 2nd, I guess a few days before E3 starts. The event will be streamed online. They haven't said which sites yet. Um, and there's going to be, I guess, um, like a sitting room where people can watch trailers for stuff and they're also going to have like, uh, parties in LA, San Francisco, Toronto, um, Sao Paulo and Mexico city and other cities. They haven't really finalized this list of cities yet. Um, and apparently they're going to be inviting the press and stuff like that to these things. Oh, I guess we need no fucking invite. And you know, I can, I can, I can understand that, you know, uh, you know, what whole LA thinks that's, that's fucking far and they're not going to pay for us to fly in there. But San Francisco, man, that's like, that's like an hour or two away. And whatever, you know what, I don't give a shit about your fucking Yu-Gi-Oh game that you have there. Um, so yeah. And then I think also on their Facebook and stuff, they were doing this contest where like, be the ultimate Konami fan and tell us why you are the ultimate Konami fan. You can win like an iPad or, you know, a trip to E3 or some crap like that. So, uh, more on that I'm sure as we get closer to the states, cause obviously they haven't really announced too much other than, Hey, we're going to be, uh, doing our first annual pre-E3 show. So not really niche. Maybe we can make a drinking game out of that too. That'd be fun. We could. I mean, obviously they're going to be showing what, um, the, uh, Melger Solid, um, Rising Game, which still hasn't come out. So that, that's probably, you know, one of the big things. Silent Hill Downpour. That'll be another big one. Um, that's pretty much it. I mean, I guess, I guess they're bringing No More Heroes over here. They're localizing that for the PS3. Um, so they'll show that. But we've got our Dance Masters game. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if anyone caught some of my tweets earlier this week. Uh, you know, I, Red Bull in the Morning does some weird things to my brain, but I got this wonderful, weird idea of pitching a game to Konami, you know, like fixing DDR, I guess, you know, making it, rebooting, rebooting, I guess. Um, that's the hip thing to do in Hollywood these days, rebooting it. And I don't think it's that far off. Obviously, it's gonna be a hell of a lot of work, and I need to, um, do that right now. But first, you gotta get somebody's ear. Good luck with that. No, not actually, because, um, you know, do the pitch first, then get the person's ear. Or copyright your idea first, and then, that's how you do it. Do it the smart way. But, yeah, just because, I mean, come on. I mean, I actually did the math, and this is great, and might as well bring this up, since we're talking about it. And just to kind of show you real quick, um, or demonstrate how, how the franchise has fallen. For example, I did the numbers. According to the NPD reports, January 2011, this would be everything from 2010 and back, um, their game series. Okay, so let's start with, um, on the Wii. Hottest Party sold 2 million units. That's a little over 2 million units. The original Hottest Party in 2007. Original Hottest Party. 08. Hottest Party 2. 1.5 million units. 2009. Hottest Party 3. 390,000 units. 2010. Dance Dance Revolution. Remember their kind of reboot thing. 170,000 units. And then on the Playstation 3, Dance Dance Revolution, 60,000. You know, combine, and compare that to, you know, um, you know, oh, and Dance Master is only 47,000 units. Oh, wow. Compare that to Just Dance 2, which came out October, which was about a month before, uh, Dance Dance Revolution. 3.5 million units sold. That's more than all of, well, the first two, uh, Hottest Party games combined. So, it's sad, because they could really be, they're just not putting a lot of effort into it anymore. Uh, Brakeman in our chatroom asks, what the F is Hottest Party? Is that one of those AO games? Now, that would be an awesome way to reboot the series, don't you agree? Uh, DDR Dolla Bill in our chatroom says, I didn't even know DDR kept getting releases until someone gave me the step mania files. Maybe that's part of the problem. The community's been kind of, like, if you go to DDR Freak, you'll see the tumbleweed rolling by. I mean, there's not nearly the community they're used to, you know. But I don't think they really need necessarily the community for it. There's not a big community for Just Dance. True. I mean, it's all about being current, and I think what the problem's been is they've been trying to innovate with the series, and they just don't know how. They don't really know which direction to take it in, so they're taking it in all the directions at the same time. You know, they're like, oh, okay, we're gonna innovate by adding 8 panel dance mode, or something like that. No, that's not what you do. They're trying to shove square pegs into the round hole. Exactly. That's the problem. And I think, I don't know. I have some good ideas. It's hard to describe them over the radio because it's all in my head right now, and I've tried to, like, sit down and type out what I'm thinking, but if I can get what's in my head on paper, it's gonna be awesome. That's the problem. But I have some fresh ideas for it, so see if I don't get bored of this whole idea and actually finish it and be able to pitch it. It would be awesome. But yeah, once again, you know they're not gonna give a shit if they're not, you know, if they're just, you know, they don't want to try, then that's fine. So folks in the chat room are commenting that folks moved on to other websites, like Bamani style and so forth, but those websites are not just about DDR, and usually DDR seems to not be the focus at all. You know what I mean? So that's why DDR is continuing to plummet. Other games might be doing okay. Like, DJ Max Portable got released in the US because of the following it has here, but, you know, DDR is a different game. The thing is though, it's, you know, Dance Dance Revolution was kind of like the innovator, you know, it brought, you know, kind of people to the genre first, and then, you know, now they have these other games out there, and they're doing really well. And that's not to say that Dance Dance Revolution can't do very, you know, that well, even if it did half as well, it would still be way better than what it is now. And so that's the thing is, all they have to do is figure out how to capture that audience, and I think I know how to do that, just based off of what they've done and what hasn't worked. And what has worked, and you just kind of combine all the, they have all the pieces there, it's just, they're not doing it right. Well I want to know, I hope you get your audience with Konami someday. Alright, let's move on. A couple more stories for you guys, yeah, buy stock. I actually thought about buying stock in Sony, just so I could sign a petition to shake up the management, but we'll see. Alright, anyhow, quick, quick story about Quake and Wolfenstein. Yes, some old, old properties that are, you know, very near and dear in a lot of First Person Shooter fans' hearts. An interesting comment from senior producer Jason Kim when Shaq News spoke with id Software, I call him ID Software, some people call him id, quote, our studio has grown a lot, not just in size, but also in design and art process, and even a technology standpoint. John Carmack has admitted that he can't do everything on his own. There are a lot of smart guys that are required to be able to make a game these days. We have Quake, we have Wolfenstein. If people want that, we have the IPs to deliver it, and we have a different approach now. We're forging a new path. I think we can freshen those things up. We don't have anything in the works right now, but I think when we start talking about different things we can do with the other properties that we have, I hope people are receptive to what we want to do, and what we think would be fun for players to experience coming out of id Software. Well, I mean, there was a new Wolfenstein game not that long ago, and it wasn't very remarkable, and then there was a, the Quake Arena on Xbox Live's pretty cool, but the Quake 4 was not cool actually, it was not that great, because that was on Xbox 360, right? Yeah, it wasn't very good. So, uh, yeah. We'll see. I mean, I'm all for going back to the drawing board with new ideas, and those are two big properties. I used to love Quake back in the day. And Quake 3 and Quake Arena are actually a lot of fun, so. Did you ever play Ascii Quake? No, I never played Ascii Quake. But, I remember the old Quake CD. I always got to Quake. I got to Doom. People have a lot of free time on their hands, what can I say? Alright, so, speaking of a lot of free time on our hands, a little segment we like to do on this show once in a while is a segment where we try to come up with the definitive list on a topic. That's right, after we're done tonight, we are going to go through a list and find out the exact top 3 scientifically proven answers to a topic. It's a process we call listless! The way listless works, since we haven't played this in a little while. We're going to give you a topic, and the topic tonight is thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. And then the 4 of us, yes we're going to get someone online in just a moment, the 4 of us will go around the room and each give our top 3 answers as to what should be on that list. That will leave us with a list of 12. Then, the hard part, oh this is the hard part, but you know reality shows are all about voting things off, so we each go around and take one thing off the list. That leaves us with a list of 8 that you the chatters get to vote on, and you vote for your top 3 and that's it, that's the list. That's the answers right there. Tonight's topic, thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. You can give your answers in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, I can't guarantee we'll use them, but when one of our hosts is struggling to find an answer or if something gets duplicated, we'll usually turn to the chatroom. Alright, let's bring in our 4th person here, I'm going to go ahead and give them a call. Let me dip the Skype line down here, or I'm sorry, let me dip the music down here for just a minute so we can call on the Skype line. I've got somebody set up here. Hello. Hi, is this Tiara? Yes, it is. It's the one and only Tiara aka Marin Marvel joining us tonight. You might have heard the commercial for pop culture parlay in between the segments tonight if you were listening live. Tell us real quick about, pimp your projects, Marin Marvel, before you play with us tonight. Well, as you know, I steal Jamie about once a week and we do Comic Insanity, which is a comics and kind of like a geek culture podcast where we talk about fun stuff. And then there's Pop Culture Parlay, which is just kind of a little bit of craziness where Weasel aka Jonathan Long, who works for EA, and myself kind of talk about different pop culture stuff. We've done like Star Wars versus Star Trek. We've talked about the best Batman. We've talked about all sorts of random stuff. So it's just really, really fun. Really, really good time and that's on geek-life.com. Awesome. Well, best of luck with all those projects. You know I like to sometimes poke fun at the stuff you and Dark Sakura do at the Giggling Girls show, but you guys do very hard work. So best of luck. All right. You ready to play listless with us tonight? I sure am. Yay. Then I can play music again. All right. Of course, the topic tonight, Thing PlayStation Network could do to get me to come back once it, or I'm sorry, wait, what was the exact thing I wrote here? Thing PlayStation Network needs when it comes back to make me care again, because you know, it's been 18 days. Most of us now are used to a life without PlayStation Network. So what is it that they can do to make me give a care when they come back? They've been talking about this welcome back program. Let's see, we're going to go around the room and get the top three. We will start with, we'll let the ladies go first. Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. What is your number three answer on the list? Thing they could do to get you to come back? Mind control via nanobots. Mind control via nanobots. How would that work with a PlayStation? By the way, your answers can be as serious or as silly as you want. That's part of the fun. Because I have a first model PS3, so clearly it has the hardware inside of it to create nanobots based off of data sent in through the PSN once it comes back up. And what would be the first thing you'd mind control? No, it would mind control me to care. Oh, okay, I see, I see. Yeah, it would mind control me to care. Okay, there you go. Alright, Mar and Marvel, we'll go to you. What's your number three answer? Thing that PlayStation could do to get you to care? Well, since there's all this talk about how, you know, our data has been like stolen, maybe they could give us like a year of free credit reporting so that we can keep an eye on our credit and like make sure that those people that are stealing our information aren't like buying things from Nigerians and stuff. To be fair, they sort of did, but I think you're talking about something a little more intense than what this whole Debex thing is about. Debex is credit monitoring, but not credit reporting. So there is a difference. All right. All right. Just want to clarify the difference for our listeners because you know how internet people will be. They'll say, dear orange lounge radio, your guest was uninformed. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. My number three answer thing that PlayStation Network could do. How about a PlayStation two emulator download for my collection? Yeah, they've been rumored to work on one of those for years. I'd like to see that come out. So PlayStation two emulator, I don't care how they have to get it to work. Just get it to work. If you want me to care. All right. That's my number three answer. Loki, what is your number three answer? Uh, here's the problem is I don't really care. Um, but so I'll just try to pick popular answers instead. This one will go for Rob, uh, upping the cap of members allowed in the PlayStation home clubs. I like say a billion. That would be perfect. That is a practical answer. I love that. Cause right now in the orange lounge radio club, I'm allowed to have 25 people when I have people that's not a club. I don't want to sound cocky. We have a little more than 25 people that listen to this program that have a PlayStation three. So I would really like to be able to invite more people because unfortunately we've got a list of about, I'm, I've shit you not more than 25 waiting like invites. I can't do anything with them because I'm limited. Of course, I don't know what we would do in the PlayStation home club. I just want to have a big club. Let's go to dark Sakura place or excuse me, your number two answer for the listing PlayStation network could do to get you to care, morph the system into a dream cast to has been left in the other room. So it would just instantly transform wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. And it's a dream cast to outstanding with a big Sega logo flipping off PlayStation via a firmware update. All right, Martin Marvel, your number two answer. I would like a new attachment for the PS three that serves frozen yogurt. It doesn't have to be Pinkberry. You know, I'm not, I'm not a snob here. You're not asking for the world. Just frozen yogurt. All right. I like that. A new attachment that will serve frozen yogurt. I like that answer. All right. Uh, let's see my number two answer for thing that they could do, uh, to get me to care about PlayStation network. Uh, guardian legend two released as a PlayStation network exclusive. Of course, the greatest, most underrated eight bit game of all time. Guardian legend two would have to come out as a PSN exclusive. That would get me to care and it better be better than that blaster master remake they had on week is that was not the quality of my need. That was weak. I see what you did there. Good one. Loki, your number two answer. Uh, once again, like reiterate, I really don't care. Um, I guess since it would make a lot of people happy and probably end a lot of their problems, just bring back the, uh, Linux support or other OS, I guess, you know, here's a thought, Sony, you could, you know, you could patch that so that, you know, maybe it doesn't allow you access to everything. Why is that? See, I never understood that. Let's just get rid of the whole Linux support instead of, I don't know, patching it so that it doesn't allow people to hack us. You know, I can't, I can't for the life of me believe that amongst all this talk of frozen yogurt and mind control, Loki is the voice of reason tonight here on orange lounge radio. Am I in bizarro world? What is going on? Anything from them. What do I want? It's like a blow job. That's what you want. No, I Sony blow job. Really? I mean, that would be unsatisfying. I could tell you that much. All right, here's the list as it is so far. We disabled the good feature, you know, we disabled the humming feature mind control via nano bots. We disabled the feature that will swallow. All right now, mind control via nano bots. Give us a year of free credit reporting, PlayStation two emulator downloading, upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs, morph the system into a dreamcast to walla walla walla new attachment that serves frozen yogurt, guardian legend to PlayStation network exclusive and bring back the other OS feature. All right, let's go around and get the number one answers from the folks here in studio, dark soccer, number one thing that could bring you back a year of pink berry, a year of pink berry with this, with this actually come out of the PlayStation three, like Mara Marvel suggested, or would this be just a coupon redeemable at your local store? It would be like a card that's got like 365 charges on it for pink berry. I speak because I like going to pink berry and listening to the music. All right, Mara and Marvel, your number three answer. How about some free download content, like for people who, for like, you know, co-op games and games that you play online. So since people have missed all that kind of stuff during this whole debacle, they can get some free download content and make up for not shooting things. I'm sorry. And of course, that's the number one answer. I just shortened that to free download content of good games. Yes. As opposed to like, you know, undertow. All right. Free download or, or, uh, Yaris. Okay. Free download content of good games. All right. My number one answer to the question thing placed it, by the way, I have to read this comment from salacious pop. A Sony blow job is $30 more expensive from a similar competent brand. And the no toothy head feature has to be ordered from a neighboring store and costs even more. All right. My number one answer for thing PlayStation network needs when it comes back to make me care about it again. Drum roll, please. Gay pornography, which is even more fun than funny than straight pornography. All right. That was my number one answer. Gay pornography would get me to care selling, selling gay porn on the end. Yeah. Okay. So that all you like, you know, straight guys at home, they're going fine. Lesbian porn galore. Just les bows are us is what the PlayStation store renames itself to enjoy. All right. Loki, your number one answer for the thing placed in network could do to get you back. Um, give a fuck about it. Um, you know, this is, those even have to be free and it's not even necessarily something that they give to me, but it'd be kind of cool if they put out a new AIBO, I guess. I mean, I don't know. I really Loki. Why not? I mean, okay, everybody point and laugh at Loki. I don't know. I just like, I, I don't care that their networks now cause they never used it. The thing you want most of the world. Loki is a new AIBO. Not really. I actually, I would like, no, scratch that. Let's screw. Screw the AIBO thing. All right. All right. Okay. Thing I would like most from Sony thing from Sony. They have really no power to do this, but I would like the clerks animated series back on air. So, you know, maybe they could, you know, make that happen. That would be awesome. All right. So get the clerks animated series back on air. All right. Much better answer. All right. So let's recap the list. Here comes the hard part. You guys, we got to take one off the list. I'm sorry. It's just the way it works. It's a, it's a, it's tough love folks. It's tough love. Here's the list is a stand so far. Mind control via nanobots. Give us a year of free credit reporting PlayStation two emulator, downloading upping the cap of members allowed in home clubs morph the system into a dreamcast to walla walla walla walla new attachment that serves frozen yogurt guardian legend to PSN exclusive. Bring back the other OS feature. Did I cut out for a minute? Sorry. Bring back the other OS feature. A year of pink Berry, free download content of good games, gay pornography and clerks animated series back on air. These are all things that could actually happen. I like how SSJ 100 Matt says won't happen. Disney has the rights to it. Who said this is realistic at all? SSJ 100 Matt. This is what we want. They have to, I don't, I don't give a shit that Disney own it owns it. Make it happen. By the way, let's read some of the comments from chat here. Uh, let's see what were some of the stuff. Uh, break man says, cause her eye kills a puppy. Anytime someone mentions free games on his network. That's not an answer. We wouldn't want to kill puppies. That's not going to get us do anything. Uh, bonds 006 agrees. Make PS3 backward compatible. Uh, SSJ 100 Matt make president cap playable for the move. Uh, dark Tetsuya says make PlayStation network out of bacon. Uh, lots of good answers there in chat, but unfortunately we've got to go through the list and figure out what is not worthy of the list. So dark Sakura, which of these items is not worthy of the list? It's going to be tough. Um, bring back the other OS cause I don't give a shit. All right. She's striking what is probably the most logical answer on the entire list. Bring back the other OS feature. It has been stricken from the list. All right. Uh, Marin Marvel, hopefully you have the list in your mind. You know what you want to take off. Which one of these is not worthy of the list? Well, personally I don't want my brain controlled by nanobots, so I'm going to have to go with that one. All right. So mind control via nanobots. It has been stricken from the list. Uh, the answer I'm going to have to remove from the list. I'm so sorry, but when you have pink berry and frozen yogurt on the same list, pink berry wins. So I have to eliminate the new attachment that serves frozen yogurt. Attachment that serves frozen yogurt could serve pink berry. I'm just saying the PS three is too hot. It's a George Foreman grill, so it has been removed from the list. Sorry. All right, low key. Which one of these is not worthy of the list? A lot. Um, no offense. Uh, I'm going to have to say, uh, so wrong but uh, yeah, I'm going to have to say free download content of good games. It's just, come on. That's a cheap way out. Free download card. Here's a dollar. Screw that. All right. So here is the list as it is right now. Give us a year of free credit reporting. PlayStation two emulators down that one. Oh, well being the cap of members allowed in home clubs morph the system into a dreamcast to wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall. Guardian legend to PlayStation network exclusive a year of pink berry, gay pornography and clerks animated series back on air. How did gay pornography survive? Well, I don't know, but it's your turn to vote. There's the list in the chat room. Send a private message to sky with your vote with your number one and number two most wanted answer. Please label your one and two choices as one is worth more. So there you go. Send a private message. We'll tally them all up and we'll let you know the winners right after the mailbag loot Mara Marvel though. As for now, we are going to go ahead and say goodbye, but thank you so much for playing with us tonight. No problem. I'm sorry. Half your list got eliminated, but that's what happens sometimes. Yeah, that's all right. You still did a great job and best of luck of course, with your other projects. Thank you very much. All right, take care. Bye guys. All right. Thank you. Of course to tear. She's filling in very last minute too. Cause I put this on Twitter like 30 minutes before. So there you go. What's with the slacking? Huh? Cause it's cause someone didn't have their show. Roll stories up till about 15 minutes before that. No, someone texted you hours ago and said blah, blah, blah, blah. All right. Let's move on. We have a few more stories for you guys and we're going to get to the mailbag Loki. Ah, fun stuff. Um, so rumors, I got to get into more rumors. Of course, you know, everybody's Jones in the sea. What the hell exactly is going to be a part of the new Wii system? And uh, there's a lot of speculation out there, a lot of unnamed sources and whatnot. So take this with a big grain of salt. But, um, apparently here's some of the rumors. Uh, they're saying that it's only going to have eight gigabytes of storage on board. Kind of think of it like the flash based storage that they had already. Um, they're saying it's going to be augmented though by SD card support. So kind of think of like the Wii was just a little bit bigger than eight gigabytes. You don't compare that to like say the Microsoft, um, you know, Xbox, the new system. Um, you know, that has four gigabytes built into some of them. So that's not too bad. Um, they're saying that the storage space is going to be on the actual disks. It's going to be using, um, some 25 gigabyte disks are saying maybe like a single layer blu-ray disc. Um, although they're not really saying what type of disk format they're using. Also that, uh, the 10 ADP output is not necessarily a definite. It might be, you know, lower than that, seven 20 or something. Um, honestly though, if they're going to be pushing visuals that are better than Sony and Microsoft, they really do need to do 10 ADP I think at the very least. Although they're saying that it might be 10 ADI. So I, I, come on, don't skimp on this shit. That's all I got to say. But of course we're not going to really know until the dam system comes out. So let's let the wait. All right. You just have to wait and see and wait one more month. Exactly. And then, um, I don't know. I'll be interesting. I have a feeling when I think of Nintendo announcing the system at during their press conference, all the only word that comes to my mind is disappointment. So I'm expecting disappointment. All right. Well there is some good news I guess to talk about. It does have to do with world of Warcraft, but this is good news. They have a released in the world of Warcraft store. They're little, I know you all love this word, but microtransaction store they've got going on, uh, between now and July 31st, if you buy their latest in game pet, which is the Sonarian hatchling, I believe cute. I believe it's based off an old, old Mount that was available at one time, but now it's a little pet. And if you buy this Mount or I'm sorry, excuse me, this pet for $10, 100% of that $10 will be donated to the red crosses, Japan earthquake and Pacific tsunami relief effort. Uh, there was a big call for blizzard to do something like this because obviously, you know, they've sold mounts and things like that strictly for profit before. They've also done sales where half the profits go to something. And I believe they recently said, uh, they sold the Moon King Moonkin hatchling patent not that long ago and they gave half the proceeds to make a wish foundation. And I believe it raised $800,000. So imagine what a hundred percent of the proceeds you're going to raise for this very needed cause. I mean, even, even now, I mean, I realize you're not seeing it every day in the news, but that doesn't mean it was cleaned up overnight and everybody is suddenly, you know, all better. That's not how this works. So, uh, I'm glad there's continuing to do things for, uh, Japanese tsunami relief. That's great. And just the power of it's nice to see good news about games and plus just the power of a beast like world of Warcraft, you know, so very cool. All right, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag out orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer likes to dive into the mailbag. Get your letters out and read them right here in the segment. The OLR mailbag. Um, just for the record, I'm not reading anything related to PlayStation at work. Uh, making that disclaimer ahead of time. Hey guys, it's blade three. I just wanted to say thanks for everything again. And if you could reprimands, I guess reprimand or completely extricated video game or company EG or Ubisoft and why you would do that. Okay. Wait, which company would we rep reprimand out of them? And if you could, I'm not getting the context on here. What are we reprimanding them for? You've been very naughty. I have no idea. We do that all the time anyway. Thanks again guys. Keep up the fantastic work and Loki rock piece guys. This message brought to you by make employees I work with make rocks look like Einstein. Uh, we would reprimand them all when they deserve it. That's, that's how these things work. Hey, OLR or OLF orange lounge video. Long time no type. I wanted to show you a picture of a Navajo taco. There's sometimes called Indian tacos. Is there a picture? Oh, this was a, this is a follow up to the email from last week. This image has been removed for security reasons. Owned owned by the security filter taco. Hold on, hold on. There's an easy solution to this. Watch. I'm going to go to google.com and I'm going to click on images and then I'm going to type na va ho taco. I'm going to hit enter and there it is. It's like a, Oh, this is like a Mexican pizza type of thing. But let me re finish reading this. Then you think of that taco bell entree, which is not the same. Okay, I get it. Fortunately, I couldn't find any pictures of a Navajo taco that I've made in the past, so I had to settle for one off google search. I am Navajo myself, so I make these quite often. Navajo tacos are similar to a normal taco with a few of exceptions. One, you use fry bread, sometimes called fried bread in place of the taco shell. It's not a Navajo taco without our, without fry bread. Two, beans are added, usually refried beans. They're really good and much bigger than a normal taco. Sometimes you can fold them, eat them like an actual taco. Some people use a fork and knife if they're too big. I usually eat them like a pizza. Oh Rob, your comparison was astute. When I introduce someone to a Navajo taco, they fall in love. If you want to try one of these, I suggest checking out the next powwow that might be in your area. You know what, now that you've mentioned it, I have had one before. I had one, um, in Alabama at the Creek Indian Powwow, but that's not what they were called. Okay. But you can find people making these tacos there most of the time. Don't get them from any carnival or fairs. They're not usually the best tasting there. That's all I wanted to share. I'll let you guys get back to gaming. Happy eating AJ twist of unfocused podcast. Well thank you for the email. And that Navajo taco did look yummy. I really, really freaking want a taco, Rob. Alright. Okay. Uh, oh yeah, we already covered the, uh, well this comes from Rababa, but it's about the, uh, Smithsonian exhibit and I'm just going to skip the, uh, winners list and go right into the bulk of the email. I disagree with some of the choices which are moot points. The one I think is obviously a wrong pick is Pac-Man for the Atari 2600. I hope they critique about the lack of advanced techniques for graphics in the overly short development cycle for that game. Seriously, I hope that they show the progression of detail shifting from highly stylized artwork like on adventure or haunted house to in game art. I always kind of wish that they would make, that they'd make a new space invaders with the yeti like aliens throwing lightning bolts from the side of the arcade cabinet. I also hope they show the graphic art design on different publishers game boxes. I will definitely go see the exhibit. Pictures. Um, don't care. Sony's getting sued. Of course. Like I said, I'm not reading anything about the, um, PlayStation. Ho and Spazinator sends a follow up email. That's the one that, okay. The one on Monday he said not to read. Disregard it. Okay. I just had everything pulled up. Okay. Um, more about PlayStation. Sorry Rababa. Last email to Sky Dark Sakura and Loki. Have you ever bought a game just for the sake of having it? I mean, yeah, you bought the game to play it, but you bought it more for the fact of having it for your collection than to actually play it. Thanks. Peace out Ranma. Good question. I have all the time. I got Dan, the Gunstar heroes on a Game Gear. I don't think he's opened it yet. I bought Metal Gear Solid four because I got it for a really good deal. I got it for 20 bucks when most places were still selling it for 50 at a radio shack that was, uh, on clearance with all their games in Hawaii nonetheless. And I've not played it to this day. I got a forgotten realms D and D game because it came with a game with a gaming module. It was a big PC one. At the first, um, loud. I bought collector's editions of burning crusade and wrath of the Lich King. Granted the burning crusade one was all autographed, but I gave it to someone for a Christmas present. And then I kept the wrath of Lich King one, which I actually still haven't even used because I already had it. So I just bought it for the, I actually do have my final fantasy 11 beta discs still. Nice. Yeah. Loki, anything you've ever bought just to have for your collection? Like, I don't know, a Japanese three years and not play it. Yeah. Um, well I bought like three copies of, uh, earth defense force, but there were cheap. Um, I've played this about once or twice. President cat. Nice. I want to borrow it. Sure. If we can get it to work on my system. Can't without a mod ship. Well, then she's going to have to borrow the, we do can't wife is playing animal crossing. Don't. All right. Uh, is that it for emails? That's it. Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com. Now I know you're all dying to know the results of tonight's list lists, so let's get to the results. We have the definitive list. You guys, these are, this is it. These are the three things we want. Actually it's for tonight cause there was a tie, but these are the things that we demand for us to care about. PlayStation network when it comes back up online. Number three, a PlayStation two emulator download. That's the number three. Number two, it's a tie. The number two thing you most want that will bring you back to PlayStation network. The clerks animated series back on the air and gay pornography. Yay porn. And the number one thing that could get you to come back and give a shit about PlayStation is if it were to morph into a dreamcast too. Yay. There it is. The definitive list. Dream cats again. Number thing, PS two emulator. Number two, clerks and gay porn tie. And number, that's the only time you'll ever hear me say that. And number one, morphing the system into a dreamcast too. That's it. No arguing. We're done. Just something troubling went into my head. What? Clerk says a gay porn. Not funny. Black Wolf says I voted for lesbian porn. What's it? It's lady gay. Same diff. Gay with boobs. That's right. I'm moving on. These are all formalities. Uh, we're going to get to the ranty part of the show. It's the part of the show we call the F use of the week. Rawr. Dark Sakura. Um, F you to me not having any tacos right now. I really want fish tacos from Carolina's, but I don't want to drive out and get them. I got you that last week. I know. I want, I really taco and finals freaking finals and four hour rendering and Maya bite my butt. Loki. Um, my head hurts. Guess if you have that, I guess the show makes your head hurt. Yes. Uh, my F you goes to myself for staying up until four 30 in the morning yesterday. I was driving home from the Bay area very late. That was kind of dumb, but I slept until noon today and that part was awesome. There we go. That's the F use of the week. Just a couple more stories for you guys. And then the Skype line, we're going to open it up at one eight seven seven game O L R or a username on Skype. Orange lounge radio will be open just after a couple more stories. Loki. Um, one of the things Nintendo, I guess was bad about for this generation of games was launching really big titles around when third parties are launching. They're really big titles, thus stealing away sales from these other third parties that they're working with. Um, apparently, you know, they were kind of stepping on their toes. So what they're doing now, at least they're promising to do is, um, that the three ds versions of super Mario and Mario cart, uh, they said they want other companies to be successful in order to accomplish this goal. They're going to dedicate or decide on dates after they know what the release plans of other companies are so that they can be considerate to them and so that they can all maximize their sales, uh, for the short term. So that's kind of cool at least. How considerate. Yes. Um, well, I guess that's one way to help, you know, get third parties on board for your new system and it would not fucking them over like that. That'd be awesome. Awesome. All right, well, uh, one more story for you guys and it has to do with the useless peripheral. Yay. This is a peripheral by CTA digital and it's going to cost you $13. Guess what it is? It's a steering wheel for connect. You know, that's not as bad as the, the inflatable boat. That w that thing was fucking awesome. But uh, here it is. This is the coolest thing about it. It's translucent. It's a see through steering wheel because I guess with the connect, you don't want the connect to see the steering wheel. It's only going to see your hand. Okay. Who drives the steering wheel up at their face? I mean, are you, I'm not going to mention anything because that's just only going to be racist if I do anything like that. I drive, I just drive with one hand on the steering wheel usually, but connect doesn't recognize that. I have to drive like a regular person like 10 and do you have to drive like you're a bad actor. Exactly. So there you go. Uh, make sure you preorder that right away. Hey, guess what folks, if you want to be able to do such things as drive without, you know, with a steering wheel peripheral, you know what you can do? You can get anything to act like a steering wheel, just a stick, a plate, you know, an actual steering wheel, a car, a kitten, you know, a taco. I mean, why do you need to buy? Oh my God. Dark soccer. They need to power video games with tacos. They need to power me with tacos. One eight seven seven game. O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. By the way, black wolf wants to clarify in the chat room. I tried playing joy ride using the Mario cart. We wheel and it didn't work, so that's why it's translucent. I see. Well, we'll trick those infrared beams after all. All right, the calls are coming in already. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's your local plug for Ronda. Of course. Of course you get in the Skype line first too. It's like you have a gift. All right, what's on your mind, buddy? Before I begin, I just got one thing to say, Rob. Yes. A blender, really a blender. What's wrong with the blender? This just proves to me that you have been listening to the show. I will confirm or deny nothing. Okay. I'm going to make this quick and so, and move it along. Okay. Yes. All right. First thing in response about Nintendo's next gen controller, I would be just happy if they just took the original super NES controller, put two analog sticks on there and a little touch screen and I'll be happy. Okay. Touch screen. I don't really see the point of that, but if you need a super Nintendo controller, two analog sticks, that'd be called the classic controller. That's all we need, but I can understand. I'd be happy with the super Nintendo controller with a fleshlight attachment. That's what I'd be happy with. Oh God. Nintendo's going to deliver an experience like never before. This is only adults only. Fuck you kids. We don't need you anymore. You said we were hard corn off. Well, fuck you. No, seriously. Fuck you. I'm waving the flag over here. It's the Nintendo fuck you coming up this Christmas. That's a pretty catchy name. Where were we? I'm sorry. See low green to sing the theme song. Oh God. Ah, yes. Oh, hold on. I'm sorry for the dead air here, but I'm setting something up here. Hold on. Here we go. Oh no. All right. Let's see here. If I can, uh, Oh God damn it. I can't. Okay. Here we go. Ah, nevermind. The joke's derailed now. All right. What do you want? Oh, there we go. Coming this Christmas from Nintendo, the company that brought you such hardcore games as the legend of Zelda. It's the Nintendo fuck you. What were you talking about? Touch screens. But on retrospect of that, I said the next gen console should be called the Nintendo. Simple as that. Oh God. It's going to be some really retarded, like Nintendo HD or like, I mean, cause seriously the, the DS, the 3DS. I, um, I would, I, if they're going with this whole Facebook route, I would say it's going to be called Nintendo.com will be the name of this. Here's how it will be. The Nintendo HD. So HD, lowercase I, lowercase I. What? Get it? It's like the Wii. Nintendo HD. Oh, D. Oh, HD. Boy. Oh boy. What do they need to put in a Nintendo console to make you a really excited around my, or are you just excited on principle? I want more 2D Mario brothers cause I'm sick of the 3D Mario games. I'm sorry. I thought Mario 64 was great. And then I got tired of it. You mean to tell me I'm sitting here going through the level eight times to get these stars. That's it. I'm done. Nope. No more of that. Yeah. Well, what about all those people that are like Mario 64 is the best game ever made. I'm going to plead the fifth amendment on that one. Oh, that means, uh, I should play the Cielo song again. All right. Yes. All right. Well, any other thoughts for listeners tonight? Oh yeah. I did find out something that before Activision canceled the entire Guitar Hero franchise, they were actually working on one more game. Well now it could come back someday. They've left the door open a crack. They haven't shut the door on it completely. Yes. It's called Guitar Hero Grateful Dead edition. It comes with five songs, 20 minutes each and the collector's edition comes with a one pound bag of weed. I was going to say there's the punchline has to be like a pound of coke or a pound of weed. No Motley Crue version comes with a one pound bag of crack. And a straw. Now that's living the rock star experience. All right. On that note, Rama, we'll let you go. Bye. Take care. One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio, but there's already calls coming in. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Good evening, OLR. This is blue swim. Hey, blue swim. What's on your mind, buddy? I was wondering if you guys heard about the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure. Is it is it interesting? I mean, well, I don't want to sound rude, but like, you know, we tried to get all the details a couple of months ago and weren't very successful. It was kind of like trying to I don't know. All right. Well, what's the latest on Techno Kitten Adventure? Actually, it is going mobile. Oh, OK. Yeah, I seem to remember something about the whole thing where they were going to. Yeah, I remember him saying he was trying to strike deals with people like Android and iPhone and all that stuff. So it's going mobile, huh? Yeah. Looks to be iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Windows seven phone with Android to follow. And it looks like it's going to come out on June seventh. Wow. Ninety nine cents. Didn't say anything about price, but it's going to have new levels, new music, new features, and the Xbox version is going to get it as well. Oh, interesting. So they're going to upgrade the existing one or there's going to be an all new one. From what I'm seeing, it looks like it will be upgrading the original on the Xbox Live indie games. Nice, because I already bought that one, so that would be cool. By the way, if you've never played Techno Kitten Adventure, it's a disgustingly simple game. You play a kitten that's flying through the air to techno music and you just don't want to hit a wall or you'll hear a little meow. Actually, I should fire up a clip. It's been a couple months, right? We're all ready to hear the song again, right? Hell yeah. Let me fire up YouTube here. Now, where did you read about this? On his official website, do you subscribe to the dude's blog? Actually, I saw it on his Twitter on the official Techno Kitten Adventure Twitter feed. I think it's I can has kitten or something like that. All right. And it's linking to an article on no gamer left behind. All right. Well, here you go. If you have never played Techno Kitten Adventure before, then you're missing out on this. I just blew some. I just couldn't believe that guy made this game because that guy, when we interviewed him, sound like he'd been playing a lot of Grateful Dead, Guitar Hero, if you know what I mean. Yeah. I mean, have you seen the news, a new screenshot? I haven't. I love you. No, I haven't seen a new screenshot. Where are they? I retweeted it on my Twitter feed. Twitter, twitter.com slash blue swim. B plug. Cheap plug. Yes, I know. I'm a graduate of the Mick Foley School of Cheap Pops. Yes. I don't see it yet. It hasn't popped up yet. Hold on. I'm waiting. Wait, just now you did or? Oh, no, I see. I see. Oh, there it is. A few days ago. Okay. New screenshots. Oh, now there's pink dolphins and more rainbows. Quadruple rainbow. What does it mean? Also, there is a little blimp in the screen and I thought at first it said fart on the blimp, but it actually says party. It's just a little marquee that's scrolling and it looked like it said fart, but I'd laugh if there was a blimp that randomly flew across the screen and said fart. It looks like the visuals are better. Oh, sure. I'm sure they've had chance to touch it up, but it's not as cool as, uh, what was it? That one kitten that flies around the rainbow and has annoying song with it. Same game. No, I don't know. Oh, the unicorn adventure. No, no, the maim. Oh, I don't remember. All right. The one that's like, yeah, I forget the song. It was one that was super important. The portal lines. All right. Well, blue swim, do you have any other things you want to share with us tonight? Um, I think that's about it. All right. Well, um, enjoy techno kitten adventure and uh, you know, don't do drugs. Hey, I don't. I haven't done them for 24 years and I'm looking to keep that streak going. All right. Good. All right. Take care. You too. Good night guys. I know he probably doesn't do drugs, but I'm just, I'm just saying. All right. Uh, Oh, they're saying that they should make a, uh, a game out of Nyan cat. Is that the, what you were thinking of earlier? Nyan cat. All right. Nyan cat. That's what it is. All right. One eight seven seven game. O L R or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio. And if you're like one of the two people on the internet who hasn't seen it, here it is just for Loki. I have seen it, but that's what I'm saying. That's much cooler than techno kitten adventure. Like, can you imagine a game based off that one April fools? I just want to do the whole show with this in the background. It's pretty awesome. Admit it. You're singing along now. Hey, Thomas Howard, singing over that. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on a orange launch radio. Who's this? Yeah, it's like, Hey, what's on your mind, buddy? Uh, nothing much. Just like trying to like get all my chilling and relaxing before work tomorrow. But more importantly, trying to see if I could compare two, two parallels for you, you know, in terms of what I've heard last night and what I'm seeing, you know, what I've seen this weekend, case in point, Konami basically stagnating on DDR and Activision whoring out Call of Duty and Guitar Hero and basically any franchises that touch it. And to that point, it's like, the way I see it is that the only way Konami could really dig that franchise out of the, out of the grave more or less is that they have, they have to move beyond the four arrows. I know some people are just going to be, they're basically going to eat me alive for what I'm saying. But if you look at the way harmonics managed to take advantage of connect and run with it, it's pretty apparent that physical, physical controls are no longer, they no longer apply. As long as the camera is able to do all the work for you. You agree? Um, so you think that the cameras should just do everything and that there's no need for a dance pad anymore? Well, it's not even that. It's just like the, they need more modern controls. Like if you're still, if you're still relying on, you know, on a panel with four sensors to actually register input, then, then you're still stuck in the past when people have arms and legs that you should be able to capture either through like through the camera or some other panel that doesn't have any like intricate parts like that. Even DDR kind of tried the whole like arms and legs thing before though. I feel like every DDR game does something with the gimmicks. Yeah. Once again, they just, it's not even gimmicky in the sense you have to like, if you look at how dance central is only like, you're only, you're standing up while dancing, essentially. If you were able to create a version, you know, a feature dancing game that not only did that, we're allowed to do break dancing moves, which is like really, really wishful thinking I'm pulling out right now. That would be a killer feature. Now, why don't we just give them the choice, you know, to choose between doing it. And now I understand that Konami's kind of, eh, when it comes to emulating stuff. They're basically taking the same thing, applying the same methods and expecting different results. That my friends is insanity. I mean, something has to give because at this point, I mean, I somewhat care about DDR, but it's not important anymore. I've moved on in that sense ever since CF closed back home in New York city is just like, it doesn't matter. I wouldn't give two shits right now, but I mean, other people may, you know, you know, may feel different. I mean, but that's them. And that's because they're still holding on. I mean, I haven't even been on a dance. Last time I was on a dance pad was a few weeks ago. And before that month, it's like, I'm going without like DDR for, you know, at this point, it's just, you know, I couldn't, I'm fine. It won't kill me if I don't, if I don't play. Not that a day, but the bottom line is this, you know, for one company to try to, try to revive a franchise by constantly doing the same thing that got them there in the first place without innovating, it's, it's not going to look good for them. And I'm going on Activision's point where this is what happened to Guitar Hero. And this is what will happen to Call of Duty. Well, let me, let me ask you a question. Isn't it okay to let the franchise die? I mean, like for example, combat on the Atari 2600, you know what? It's just, it's just done it. There's never going to be another one. Let's just let it be. I mean, is it okay to just say, you know what? It's, we don't need DDR anymore. We have stuff like Dance Central or we have other dance games. I mean, can't we just let bygones be bygones, so to speak? I guess what they need to, what Konami needs to do is like, maybe, I don't know if they should retire the, the, the series, but try to move on, you know, try to move it on with a more spiritual, more of a spiritual, spiritual successor. Something that really isn't DDR, but it's the next evolution in that, in that whole genre. Well, isn't that supposed to be what Dance Masters is? Yeah, but that one was a rush job. It was, they didn't really think it out because it was just a simple grab for, for money by the time, you know, as a, as a Kinect launch title. I mean, now that it's already, now the cat's already out of the bag, you really, I know the cat is out of the bag. I mean, Konami really needs to take a good look at what, you know, what they can do to differentiate themselves from the competition and still be, still be profitable. I know it's a, it's a Herculean task, but I mean, it worked for harmonics in trying to, you know, to win over Guitar Hero folks in a rock band. Cause that one, you know, the innovation right there was just, you know, add more, add more peripherals. And from there, add more DLC and so forth and try to bring more realism into that experience, trying to bring an experience into the, into their living rooms or in an arcade. We got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but do you have any final thoughts for us tonight? Um, let's see, uh, PSN is probably, the way I see PSN is like, they, they, they're going to need more than a prayer. They're kind of done if they're completely compromised. All right, Zaku. Well, thank you so much for the call. Have a good one. Have a good one. Meow. All right. 1-877-GAMO-LR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. If you want to give us a call, though, I don't know if we'll get any calls after that. All right. Uh, let's see. Kaijuto in our chat room says they need to put guns in DDR. That will save it. I could figure out a way to do that, but, uh, Two step in, one steps out. No, I, I, I agree with, um, you know, the fact that they just didn't really implement a lot of things well. And I think Dance Masters could be good. It's just they didn't do it right the first time around. There's a lot of things that they, glaring omissions that she, you know, Hey, you know, it'd be fun. It's a way to learn those routines instead of having to play them over and over and over again and fail. That might be cool. You know, with the Torioma or some sort of indicator what's coming up next. Uh, you know, so dark to is suggesting just putting the end cat in DDR. All right. There. DDR kittens, dance kitten adventure. That's what's going to save the game. All right. We're gonna close up the Skype lines and someone else is calling. It's after nine anyway. So let's go around and get everybody's a final thought. Actually, I didn't get any last minute stories. We were doing call after call there. So do you a dark soccer won't start us then? Well, apparently Stephen Colbert is part of the noble team. Well, not actually. Um, he, this actually comes from a joke that he made about, um, master chief being one of the, uh, original members of seal team six. And so, uh, bungee pulled off the image and put him on, uh, an armored body. It's, it's just a mock up. It's not real, but it was pretty funny. And then, um, there was a quote going around saying that valve was getting rid of single player games, but really they're invoking single player plus to where you have social interactivity in your first in your one player games. All right. Uh, Loki, you have any final stories for earth last minute stories for us tonight? Yeah, real quick. Um, we, I think I mentioned this back a while ago. There was an indie game that was coming out on the Xbox in the marketplace, uh, that kind of combined almost think of it like a DDR meets a puzzle quest, but, uh, it's out now. Actually it's called sequence and definitely check it out. There's basically three different screens that are available that you switch between. Kind of think of like the rock band, PSP and DS version. Um, and then you, you know, tap up the sequences. Um, and one of them, I think it's like for health regeneration, one's a defense and others like a magic or attack or something like that. So, um, check it out. It's available right now for $3 or 240 Microsoft points and the title sequence. Um, and then of course it was announced this week that, uh, Nintendo is dropping the price of the we bundle to one 50 even though it was like rumored. Um, so all we systems are now going to be one 50. They're also putting out a new we bundle that's going to be with Mario cart. Um, and of course the emotion, uh, are we remote plus and that kind of stuff that available in black and white. And they're also going to be selling we sports separate because obviously this does not come with we sports. If you ask me, it's kind of a rip off because instead of getting two games for one 50 you're getting one game for one 50. Um, and you know, you kind of think, let me guess they dropped the price of we sports resort, but it's still kind of a rip off I think. Um, and then of course they also announced that they're going to be doing a line of, um, titles are going to be cheaper. Nintendo selects. Um, and the first lineup for the U S would be, and of course in the city folk, Mario's super sluggers, we sports and Zelda twilight princess. Where the fuck is the love for excite truck is what I got to ask, but you know, whatever. And then finally also, uh, in the UK they're going to be doing the Nintendo selects as well. Uh, they're going to have a little bit different of a lineup, uh, starting with a we sports course. So why are you aware smooth moves, which is a pretty awesome game, animal crossing, um, and Mario's strikers, uh, charge their football game over there. And then, uh, I mentioned this on my Twitter feed earlier. Nintendo has conceded that they have struggled with online on the we and I promise to improve it with the next system. Oh, Nintendo. Oh, and you didn't have to. Yes. So it's honestly speaking the we's future could have been different if Nintendo had made better partnerships with outside companies in the field of network services at early stages of penetration of the we penetration. Uh, in other words, Nintendo might have been a little obsessed with, uh, the policy. Uh, yeah. So, all right. Well, if that does it for last minute stories, yes. Then we're going to go around and get her base of final thoughts. First off, we want to thank you guys for downloading and listening to orange lounge radio this week or tuning in live, whatever the case may be. Uh, all we ask, we don't really play commercials except for, you know, other podcasts, but, uh, we don't, uh, make any money off this show. All we ask, tell two friends about the show, help us spread the word. Uh, even if you don't know who to tell, you could leave us a nice review on iTunes. We've had some wonderful five star reviews in the past couple of weeks. Really appreciate those. They really do go a long way in helping us get visibility and continue to spread the word of Nyan cat being played over phone calls. Uh, dark soccer. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight? I really freaking want a taco. My final thought is, uh, I'm going to just go get a taco. That's what I'm going to do. Don't make stinky face at me. Uh, Loki, your final thought. I joined Mensa and all I got was this membership card and discounts off Geico. It's official. You're smart. All right. That's it everybody. Have a wonderful week. We are done for the night, but, uh, yeah. Uh, have a good one. We'll see you next week. We'll be back to do it all again. So, uh, join us. Bye. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show. Visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time. The views and opinions expressed on orange lounge radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of orange lounge radio or all games.com, but we're probably right anyway. See you next week. All right. So something special after the credits tonight here on OLR, uh, because mostly I'm an idiot and I forgot to play this earlier in the show, but, uh, of course today is mother's day in the United States and I will, and I believe other countries too, but I want to say a very happy mother's day to all the mommies out there. Uh, all the motherly figures or whoever is considered a mother in your life. I want to say a happy mother's day to everybody. And you know, once in a while here on the show, we like to do like, you know, like a phone call to mom. So I think a couple of years ago we called dark soccer's mom. We called my mom before. I think even Loki's mom's probably been on the show at some point or another. So, um, tonight, uh, I wanted to give you guys an extra surprise and this is a very special thing for you guys that have listened through the whole thing. You've either stayed up very late with us live or you've listened through the entire podcast. But I promised you at some point I would have my mother review mortal combat. And so I have a clip of my mother watching me play mortal combat. And she actually said, if you put the video on the internet, I will kill you. However, she didn't say I couldn't play the audio for you guys on my radio show. Tell your mom, who's going to tell my mom. So here it is. Who's going to tell Rob's mom? This is the first time my mother watched us play mortal combat. And just for the record, it was Molina versus striker. Here we go. Okay, so I'm here with my mommy. You know, your, your hair looks fine. Say hi to the internet, you're fine. You look fine. Okay. How are you doing? I'm fine. So we wanted to show you a video game. It's a new video game that came out. It's called mortal combat. Have you ever heard of it? Yeah. And what do you know of it? It's violent. And what do you think about violence in games? I think it's pathetic. Why? Because it teaches little kids to be violent, but can't you like supervise little kids? Didn't I play mortal combat when I was a kid? No, I supervise kids, but a lot of parents don't. Okay. Well, we just wanted to show you the new game and see what you think of the graphics and the technology. Look at her. She's not even dressed. That's disgusting. I need a comment about that. Yeah. Her nipples aren't in the right place. If they were, you could see them. Look at her. She's an Amazon. Oh my God. They threw her around. So do you think stage fatality Rob or the uh, I would do her normal one. Is that blood all over the stage? Yep. Oh my God. She hit him right in the cahoots. What's your name? Melina. What is that she has on? There's some places missing. This, this is a game that's rated PG 17, right? It's rated M for amateur. Oh, it should be rated. She's giving them kisses. Kids have no threshold for violence. That's why, because they're conditioned that way. You got it. So after you beat the guy, you get to, here's the best part. She's going to take his head off. Oh my God. I knew it. Look at her outfit. What'd you think? It's disgusting. There you go. I love your mom. My mother reacting to the regular outfit or was it like the tape outfit? It was no, it wasn't the tape outfit. It was a regular little hoochie mama outfit there. Cause the tape outfits is worse. We hadn't unlocked that yet. We haven't gotten to the top of the tower. I think Alan's on like challenge 120 or something. So there you go. My mother's seeing Mortal Kombat for the very first time. Her nipples are in the wrong place. You know how my mom's like way more concerned with the outfit than anything else. Love it. Love you mom. Don't be mad that I put this on my show. You said I couldn't do the video. I didn't put the video up. I'm not going to put it on YouTube. There it is. I just like that you could totally hear the in the background. I was like, Oh, I know what's going on. It's head eating time. All right. That really does bring it into the podcast tonight. Uh, for those of you guys listening live, stay tuned. But for those of you guys on the podcast, this really is the end. Have a wonderful night, everybody.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 19.84, "text": " Today, May 8th, 2011, Sony is on Day 18 of PlayStation Network Outage, has a dev kit", "tokens": [6288, 11, 1737, 807, 400, 11, 2813, 11, 10184, 318, 319, 3596, 1248, 286, 14047, 7311, 3806, 496, 11, 468, 257, 1614, 6220], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.32411902001563536, "compression_ratio": 1.2448979591836735, "no_speech_prob": 0.041884515434503555}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 19.84, "end": 25.0, "text": " for the next Xbox when spotted in a game developer, and Club Nintendo makes a controversial change", "tokens": [329, 262, 1306, 9445, 618, 13489, 287, 257, 983, 8517, 11, 290, 6289, 9714, 1838, 257, 8381, 1487], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.32411902001563536, "compression_ratio": 1.2448979591836735, "no_speech_prob": 0.041884515434503555}, {"id": 2, "seek": 2500, "start": 25.0, "end": 32.88, "text": " to their privacy policy.
