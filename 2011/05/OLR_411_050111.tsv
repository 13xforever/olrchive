13883	18545	Tonight, May 1st, 2011, the PlayStation Network remains down after an entire week.
18865	23887	Portal 2 plans free DLC, and Nintendo plans a free game from the 3DS shop.
31909	38714	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39154	46018	We are live with episode number 411, the 411 if you will, on this May the 1st of 2011.
47239	52883	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, with me as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53641	55061	I will not put you in a potato.
55982	56322	Thank you.
56382	57262	And feed you two birds.
57382	57962	That's great.
58383	64725	Actually, it's kind of funny because I was at Trader Joe's today, which, by the way, super crowded grocery store today.
64785	65845	It was a madhouse.
66285	68726	And there was some hash browns that were on sale.
68986	72687	And the little label on it says, when I grow up, I want to be hash browns.
72747	75128	And I couldn't help but think of the same thing.
75548	76449	So anyhow.
77269	79149	I gave inadvertent spoilers today.
79269	79610	Sorry.
81310	83891	And the one she was spoiling, of course, was the one and only Techmaster, Loki!
84472	85652	I asked, so it's alright.
85692	86312	That's right, yeah.
86353	88053	Let's keep the show spoiler-free, guys, don't worry about it.
88253	88794	How you doing, Loki?
89134	89734	I'm doing fine.
90074	91115	And, uh, long time no see.
91135	101119	It's been a little while, because we were off for, uh, two weeks ago, and then last week, Easter week, you were, you were like, oh, I gotta do family stuff, because I have a baby now, and so family stuff's important, so whatever, Loki.
102000	102140	So...
102840	103261	How's it going?
103581	104082	It's going alright.
104383	105023	Yeah?
105444	108428	Anything exciting going on with the baby and that whole stuff?
109089	113275	He's scooting forward now, which means he'll be crawling hopefully soon.
113876	114196	Awesome.
115217	116119	I saw the video.
116519	117641	He looks so proud of himself.
118095	119215	He is very proud of himself.
119235	121776	He's like, I can move!
122536	123996	Just wait till I start walking!
124236	128197	Today he learned how to smack Mommy in the face when she's not listening.
128657	129657	Gave her a bloody nose.
130077	132078	What?
133078	134038	Oh no.
134238	137439	He gets excited sometimes and he flails around.
138119	139739	He still doesn't have fine motor control.
140040	144961	Whoever's holding him is subjected to the brunt of his attack.
145261	146621	Has he tugged on your face?
147484	148823	No, he does it all the time.
151545	151905	All right.
151985	157206	Well, we're going to start off the show, of course, with how was your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.
157266	160267	However, I do want to, of course, introduce the chat room because they're always there with us.
160647	166408	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night where gamers seem to be very opinionated this week.
166448	172989	I can't possibly imagine what could possibly have so many people with so many polarizing opinions.
173089	178510	It couldn't be that we're on day 11 of a certain network being down, which is certainly the longest.
178890	179351	Oh, my God.
179431	180231	UPN's down?
181591	195537	UPN merged with Warner Brothers years ago All that aside, we'll get into that But first, a little lighter fare How was your gaming week and what games have you been playing this week?
195577	195997	DarkSakura
196638	197698	I've been playing a lot of stuff.
198899	201240	I played DDR on Wednesday.
201340	204901	I went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza, which was actually pretty good.
206042	208843	So I cannot call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza anymore.
209303	216306	It was Julian's fourth birthday, and so we did the twister and everything, and he was a big boy and went on that.
216406	217926	John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.
218466	219567	It was actually pretty good.
219847	220827	It was actually really good.
220887	221988	They're afraid of pizza.
222008	222888	It was pretty good.
223288	224849	How long has it been since you've had pizza?
226812	227653	It was pretty good.
228173	228413	Alright.
228694	231996	Because I managed to get those both when they were fresh, the pizzas I had.
232357	236720	I'm a pizza snob and I think their pizza's terrible, but that's because I haven't had it in a while.
236740	237221	But anyway.
237301	239803	Well, I like the macaroni and cheese pizza.
239843	243306	By the way, speaking of food, would you please tell the listeners what you had before the show tonight?
244093	245574	I had a fish taco.
246294	248055	Thank you, Rob, for my taco.
248615	251497	And damn it, people, I asked for more than 10, not more than 30.
253578	260181	And yeah, if you have no idea why DarkSakura was rewarded with a taco earlier tonight, you have to listen to last week's show.
260281	262782	I just like that I completely bullshitted you into getting me a taco.
262802	264903	I was kind of fucked up.
265004	266024	Next time I want something.
266544	266764	Rob.
267005	267205	What?
268045	269806	How about after the show I get you Pinkberry?
270390	274252	That would be amazing if I didn't have work in the morning and I already foresee this show running long.
274612	276293	Okay, how about after my finals are done?
277094	277354	Okay.
277534	278574	We go celebrate at Pinkberry.
278835	279935	That works for me.
279995	280696	Sorry, back to games.
280996	281776	I'll buy Alan some too.
282557	295684	Okay, so I played some Ditter and I played this percussion master game that's supposed to be like Taiko no Tatsujin only it's a lot different and kind of sucky and had really bad covers of songs in there but I had fun playing it.
296244	303727	and then I played Afterburner Climax in the arcade because it's the only arcade machine I've seen and I love that game.
304007	304968	Did it make you climax?
307309	308109	No, but I was moist.
308309	315832	Because, you know, I just got done playing DDR.
316612	322235	And then I got Portal 2 which I got two days ago.
322695	325636	I got it Friday night and I'm already almost caught up with you
327216	328357	because I had bad insomnia.
329337	340565	My problem is that I'm only playing it on Steam because, you know, I'm kind of glad I don't have the PlayStation 1 because of certain malfunctions.
340665	342306	Excuse me while I clean something up off the floor.
345251	351035	So, and cause you know, I honestly wouldn't have played it on the console anyway, so I'm really digging playing it on Steam.
351695	362522	I play with a trackball mouse, which I'm having a good time, but yeah, I have just found, well, it's a little bit of a spoiler, but I don't care, I'll say it anyway, I found Potatoes.
364343	367065	As they refer to her on the Half-Life wiki as Potatoes.
368225	369746	So, it's been pretty cool.
370947	374129	You've heard me bitching about puzzles that make me violently ill.
375393	377079	Hey, it's my husband, I think.
377500	378483	No, it's a visitor.
378864	379607	It's a friend.
380590	381753	Anyway, so...
385462	388844	I also, crap, what else did I play?
389845	392846	I played some Dragon Age, but I'm kind of forgetting about Dragon Age for now.
392866	398709	I'm going to go ahead and give it back, because I've got Portal, although I'm probably going to end up having it beaten in the next couple days.
399190	401631	And I got level 60 for Rebecca Black.
402572	402952	On WoW?
403192	403472	On WoW.
403592	404112	World of Warcraft.
404333	406734	You still have to play co-op, because co-op's a lot of fun, too.
407725	409546	Co-op, well... No, co-op.
409586	410226	Portal, dummy.
410786	411906	Don't call me dummy, dummy.
413487	414527	I booted Darwinia.
416768	417428	But Portal.
418229	421310	I'm kind of like... It's pretty.
421790	422870	It really is pretty.
422950	429113	I've been taking tons of screen captures because my favorite thing in this game so far are the work posters.
431734	457605	but for me being a big graphic design nerd I love how perfectly they capture the styles of each era the further along that you're in the facility like the stuff from the 40s and 50s and then the 60s style logo and as you move up through the facility and you come to the modern age they really did capture the design of those different eras really nicely
458545	460567	and I love the allergen poster.
461468	462909	It's like, know your allergens.
463370	469855	Pollen, pet dander, plastic, anti-matter.
470816	474239	Please let us know if you see anyone from the FDA, the FHA.
475140	477861	There's lots of great little jokes just in the artwork.
477921	484705	And that's, you know, part of what makes this game so phenomenal is that, you know, there's just, you can just be kind of walking around looking at the scenery.
485085	488186	And it's not just the, you know, very similar to the first game.
488206	490607	Remember how there were like the cave drawing type of things?
491028	491668	Which are still there.
491828	492388	Yeah, they're there.
492969	496930	And, you know, they're not totally throughout, but you find them in certain places.
496950	497331	Well, you know why?
497351	498611	And then the signs or jokes do.
498631	500712	You know why they're not fully through there?
500892	501913	Can you tell me without spoiling?
502313	504074	We'll read the Lab Rat comic.
504534	508375	There's a comic that ties Portal to Portal 2 called Lab Rat.
508415	509275	It's a free PDF.
509595	511856	You can get it on the Valve website.
512716	520718	And it talks about Ratman, who was the guy that was living in the facilities, hiding, and he apparently was a scientist.
521238	524439	And he's the reason that Chella's the one being tested.
524999	530241	Because while she wasn't the smartest or the most athletic, she had the most tenacity.
531521	533363	and it says on her, never ever gives up.
533943	538728	So she was initially rejected as a test subject and he moved her forward.
538748	539608	And this is all in the comic.
539708	540209	Yeah, all in the comic.
540229	541570	So you're just spoiling the comic, not the game.
542130	543492	Well, there's more to it.
544152	550818	Like, there's a lot more to Ratman and there's a lot more to her and just different stuff that goes on in there.
550838	559385	So it's actually pretty, it's a good little tie-in and also if you haven't seen the restored ending for Portal, that ties in as well.
561120	562041	Going into our chatroom and chat.
562221	563161	Orangelandradio.com.
563201	564281	Defective Candy is sad.
564441	564881	I'm poor.
565021	565982	I can't buy Portal.
566762	567802	You're probably not alone.
568162	571403	And it's inevitable there will be a huge sale on Steam at some point.
571443	575124	And I would anticipate it's probably going to be around the time the first batch of download content comes out.
575524	578725	It will be, you know, hey, are you still not on Portal?
578925	579425	Get it now.
579505	579966	Half off.
579986	581906	Because Valve likes to do ridiculous sales.
581966	582386	So, you know.
582826	583947	Portal's $10 right now.
584287	585807	The only... Well, I mean Portal 2.
585867	586947	Yeah, Portal 2, yeah.
587228	588508	Well, everybody can...
589368	603255	Just watch their retail stores because they're doing POS back-end rebates for retailers through now and I think June or the end of June.
603395	606036	So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marking it down to $30 or $40.
606076	608257	What is a POS back-end?
610138	614943	POS back end rebate means point of sale so basically they get it for cheaper.
615463	622130	Each one they sell, they track how many they sell and they get a rebate from the publisher for it.
622250	626714	So it's an incentive to get them to bring in more product because they get to sell it for cheaper.
628556	631078	Just sort of like buying mass, like buying bulk, right?
631238	631999	Well, sort of.
632059	639864	That's what happened with the five retailers that had the Wii systems for $170, because that wasn't offered to everybody.
640265	643727	That was only the top five direct retailers got offered that.
643767	649512	But with Portal 2, it's a little bit flexible, so they're getting a week where they get the market down.
649552	654996	So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing down different weeks from now to the end of June.
655917	658220	Tiger Claw says, let's not forget about Cave Johnson.
658340	659522	He has some of the funniest stuff.
659842	660703	Oh, I love him.
660803	665630	And I didn't realize it at first, but it's the dude that played J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man movies.
665670	666271	And he's perfect.
667172	670837	And I love Carolyn, which I won't say anything more about her.
672279	672499	But...
674181	677063	I, but it's, it's, I knew right away it was the same voice actor.
677604	682347	So, and I, I, I love her speaking voice, but I love listening to her sing.
682928	688232	Not, not just the Jonathan Colton songs, but singing like she actually did the, the opera.
689153	689993	She's an operatic singer.
690133	693976	So I've actually gone back and listened to her sing other stuff and her voice is astounding.
694337	695598	Really, really gorgeous.
695618	695698	Yeah.
697319	701064	Um, so really most of my time has been taken up with Portal 2.
701885	707751	I have been, for all of my motion sickness, I have been breezing through it.
708332	710314	Except for the parts that I scream and yell at.
711155	712056	Oh my god, I threw up!
712116	713518	Yeah, I just started Chapter 7.
732256	734357	I'm just a few stages away from that, really.
737278	738159	I'm totally digging it.
738479	743221	The last fight, though, I'm not going to spoil it, because I did actually watch playthroughs a few times.
743641	747883	The last fight looks freaking difficult, but fun, too, at the same time.
748143	749104	So I'm looking forward to that.
749624	749904	All right.
750704	755026	Well, if that does it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, then let's go to Loki and ask, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?
756607	758568	Didn't play a lot of anything, actually.
758588	760709	Just Grand Theft Auto, really, because I've been playing...
761616	764357	Well, I've been editing stuff in Grand Theft Auto.
764397	766297	That's all I've really been doing the last two weeks.
767638	770439	Actually, I did play a few other small things.
770499	778061	Just mainly played a little bit of Unpleasant Horse, which is the new iOS game from PopCap.
778561	782382	It's their kind of spin-off company that's doing it.
783022	785985	It's funny because I don't know if there's more of these types of games coming.
786065	786746	I think there are.
787587	803642	It's free, but the premise of the game, the way they came up with it, is they had a hat with a bunch of random names in it, just different parts of a name, and so they pull out the name for the game, and they have 48 hours to complete coding the game.
805343	827041	And so the premise of Unpleasant Horse is you're this unpleasant looking unicorn fat chubby horse and you fly around or hop from cloud to cloud trying to land on happy white unicorn horses or whatever Pegasus is, I guess, and you crush them and make them fall into meat grinders.
829119	830361	That's it, and it's hilarious.
832022	834926	But yeah, definitely worth checking out since it's free.
836327	838730	And it's fun, especially if you like horse violence.
840892	841313	Like I do.
842594	843175	So that's it?
843756	846799	You know, we covered, was it Fourth Battery?
847440	849362	We covered that on the show a few weeks ago.
849562	849883	Right, yeah.
849943	853511	No, I remember the story about how it took a little while for them to get on the store, but yeah.
854012	855856	I didn't even realize the game had actually come out.
856156	858441	Last I'd heard, it had been delayed, so that's cool.
858962	859203	And then...
861772	862593	Let's see, what else?
862613	870879	There was a really cool, actually, just real quick, there was a really cool story in the, I was making the rounds on the blogs this week, and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'll mention it here.
871100	875923	I hear that PopCap designed some game as part of a Make-A-Wish thing for a nine-year-old.
875963	876904	I thought that was very cool.
877084	878285	Yeah, I think that's up there now, too.
878305	879526	That game's up in the iOS store, too.
879666	880167	It's very cool.
881028	882169	I'm trying to think of other stuff.
882449	890678	Oh, I was going to mod my laptop because these wonderful Asus laptops are not meant for proper cooling.
891218	897805	And so I'm modding the back of it so I can play some more graphic intensive games without feeling like my lap is on fire.
899627	900789	And then let's see.
900949	901770	Other than gaming...
902350	912638	I mentioned a few weeks back and this is really hilarious how I was taking a test or whatever to get into Mensa well I passed that test so I'm in Mensa now
913755	914455	Congrats.
915276	916036	I don't know what to say.
916936	917716	So now what?
917837	919217	Now what do you do as a Mensa member?
919297	921978	Is that going to be your thing now, your little M.O.
922058	922578	on the show?
923178	926800	Well, Rob, as a member of Mensa, I think my opinion matters here.
926840	928300	I need to tell you.
928320	928800	No, nothing.
928860	930701	I just want the plaque or whatever.
930721	931621	It's on your resume, right?
932102	932642	Yes, you're wondering.
932662	933522	Hang it up in your office.
933542	934322	That's basically it.
934542	935523	There you go.
935543	935923	I don't know.
936023	939024	I can attend a seminar if I want to or something, but.
939485	940806	Go hang out with all the smart people.
941166	942987	All I can say is I can analyze games.
943488	946550	Where's your midst of the placard, fucking Michael Pachter?
947070	947691	Yeah, that's right.
947711	948651	I don't think you have one.
949392	951053	I guess my opinion means a little bit more than yours.
953886	954186	Nice.
955927	959950	I was going to say, you need to go to one of these Mensa conventions, and I want to see some Mensa hotties.
960390	961791	Mensa hotties?
961851	963713	I want to see a blog of Mensa hotties.
963733	965874	They're going to be all looking like librarians, I bet.
966815	968836	Now that's a stereotype, DarkSakura.
968916	970097	That is a stereotype.
970117	971138	Vicious stereotype.
971158	972599	Does Loki look like a librarian?
972739	973459	I don't look like a librarian.
973479	975701	I was talking about the women, but okay.
975741	976521	Librarians are hot, though.
977342	981104	No, it's just, I just, I don't even know why I took the test.
981304	983486	Sarah Palin was kind of hot until she opened her mouth.
985026	985247	Anyway.
986207	987107	That all depends.
987127	989048	I mean, your opinion of Sarah Palin.
989088	996110	I mean, it might be even hotter if she opened her mouth, but... And when she started talking, though, then that just went downhill.
997251	998671	Some people like them stupid, I guess.
999392	1000372	No, I don't know.
1000412	1001152	I just thought it was funny.
1002012	1002313	But, yeah.
1002773	1003093	All right.
1003133	1005774	Well, if that's it for your Gaming Week, then I'll talk about my Gaming Week.
1006534	1008675	Oh, and I just did a... Sorry, sorry.
1008715	1010135	I just did a Street Pass thing with Rob.
1010155	1011896	So now I actually have two me's on my...
1012396	1012896	3DS now.
1013077	1013497	Yay.
1013517	1015598	That's the first time my 3DS is street passed.
1015878	1016679	You know what's awesome?
1016979	1018660	I talked about getting the 3DS on the show last week.
1018680	1019260	You know what's awesome?
1019580	1021621	I went to the mall yesterday.
1021761	1023783	I went to the mall in the really nice part of town.
1023863	1024703	And it sucked.
1024723	1026184	Where all the spoiled rich kids are.
1026564	1027265	I went there.
1027425	1028685	I went to Best Buy.
1029066	1031487	I went to some other stores.
1031967	1034168	And I was like, oh, I've got to street pass with someone.
1034208	1038171	Even if it's like the demo unit in Best Buy, I'm going to street pass with someone before this day is over.
1038531	1039792	I get home and I see, oh,
1040932	1043693	Apparently, the wireless was turned off the entire time.
1044013	1045114	That was really smart of me.
1045334	1050196	Because you know they put the wireless switch on the 3DS exactly where they put the power switch on the old DSs.
1050316	1050996	Yeah.
1051056	1052436	God damn it.
1053997	1054257	Anyhow.
1057373	1066740	Oh, apparently I'm getting a link from Derek H in our chatroom is actually linking us to this website here as a part of cha-cha.com.
1067401	1067921	I like this.
1068822	1069942	Hot Mensa members.
1070783	1073785	And it's actually a link of some hot people that are Mensa members.
1074366	1075046	Some celebrities.
1076868	1079430	Well, I guarantee I'm not part of that list.
1079490	1082612	You are not because all these people have tits, Loki.
1083192	1083913	You do not have tits.
1085774	1090195	Derek H, Gina Davis, Asia Carrera Portal 2, I also play some co-op
1109079	1112382	Obviously not on PSM, but I played on Steam, which was a lot of fun.
1112802	1121588	And, you know, we weren't using voice chat at all, because I was playing with Miklatov, and the way his place is set up, he couldn't talk, because he would wake someone up who was sleeping.
1122008	1126792	So I was playing with him, and we were using the text chat to type back and forth.
1126812	1132556	And then Portal also has, if you use the F key, you can point at things, like telling people where to put the portals.
1133016	1133536	So it was nice.
1133556	1137119	And when I would get really frustrated, I'd hit F like a thousand times on the point where I want to...
1137719	1138919	You know, have him put a portal.
1139179	1139679	So that was fun.
1139699	1139959	I like that.
1139979	1141000	Do you each have a terminus?
1142140	1142620	On the portal?
1142880	1144820	Oh yeah, you each, it's like four portals.
1144840	1148581	So all the co-op puzzles are four portals because you each have a portal guide.
1148601	1151202	So it's not like one's not the orange and the other's the blue?
1151242	1157223	Nope, one's dark blue and light blue and the other one's dark orange and like, or I should say light orange and red sort of thing.
1157463	1157703	So yeah.
1157723	1165185	Well, I know that in the original portal back, if you look at the beta pictures of it, they had a purple and pink portal originally.
1165225	1166945	I was wondering if they maybe borrowed the same scheme.
1167250	1168111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1186583	1190605	and there's only one gel that they didn't take from that game.
1191645	1192825	It's like a sticky, I think.
1192945	1199947	I'd have to look it up again, but yeah, they took the repulsion and propulsion gel from another game and they actually hired them all to help work with Portal 2.
1200047	1202128	The white gel is Portal wall gel.
1202768	1203348	Moon rocks!
1203388	1205089	Yeah, instantly have a portal wherever you want.
1205789	1218846	Um, so yeah, that, uh, it wasn't even supposed to have portals, but yeah, the game's still fun, exciting, uh, co-op mode's great, I haven't beat it yet, but we're probably, like, I don't know, like, think we're through three of the, the areas, so, I think there's, like, five or six.
1219647	1219747	Um...
1220908	1221409	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1245610	1262635	it is not only the original Final Fantasy 4 game redone it is redone in the style of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the PSP or 1 and 2 on the iPhone which was taken from the PSP versions not 3 which was taken from the DS versions but 4 has been reimagined like 1 and 2 were with redone sprites redone music
1263075	1263656	Really cool, though.
1263676	1266378	You can go in and enable the original music if you'd like to hear that.
1267299	1271663	It's the modern translation, not the original Ted Woosley one from the 90s.
1271943	1272323	That's out.
1272363	1273284	You spoony bard.
1273724	1274665	Well, they keep that line in.
1274685	1275726	They have to keep that line in.
1275746	1281171	But the rest is the proper story with all the proper text for everything.
1282871	1305998	and it also has the After Years the complete set of the After Years games which were released for several bucks a pop on the Wii and did not have souped up graphics at all it was just the same graphics from the original Super Nintendo version so it's pretty cool that they released all that in one package and it has a transition episode that's completely brand new that transitions between the two games so all of it is new um
1307003	1308504	Very cool.
1309445	1310526	It's beautiful looking.
1310846	1312167	I love that it's still 2D.
1312487	1315109	I don't hate the 3D one on the DS.
1315289	1317991	I mean, it was great, and I'm glad they did that.
1318031	1322114	But it's nice to kind of play it still the old school way, just with all the souped up graphics.
1322614	1327278	I wish this is what we could get more of on arcade or virtual console, for fuck's sake.
1327478	1329379	This would be a great thing for them to have released.
1329740	1331141	But it works great on the PSP.
1331841	1332601	Thanks for watching!
1351289	1352070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1379005	1406410	and I gotta say Minecraft the website is not I'm gonna just be honest this is my true reaction a lot of people are gonna think I'm an idiot and that's fine but I'll own up to it I did not find the Minecraft site to be very user friendly because it took me a minute to kind of figure out there's like an old version that's free or there's an old multiplayer or there's a new one that you can pay for and a new multi like there's so many different modes and it's the website's kind of dated looking and whatever so I finally found my way into the game and I played it and um
1408411	1433780	I don't get it like I don't get the big deal sorry guys like I don't understand why people are hailing Minecraft it's like oh my god like maybe it's more fun with more people or whatever but I found it to be about as thrilling as the program from Lego that lets you build your own Lego structures and then you can order the bricks and actually build them like all yeah um don't get me wrong that's kind of awesome too but um I did not think Minecraft was like OMG yeah
1434760	1435341	I agree with you.
1435621	1436642	Did you play it too?
1436682	1437322	I've played Minecraft.
1437382	1438203	I didn't care for it.
1438503	1438703	Yeah.
1438943	1440004	And that made me kind of sick.
1440684	1445407	Well, yeah, I mean, but you got the whole first person shooter thing going on that you don't usually do well with those.
1446008	1448289	But I just, I didn't get it.
1448790	1450411	I don't think it's put together very well either.
1450431	1452052	I think it's not presented very well.
1452092	1462899	I guess it's one of those like hipster things that like if you're into it, you're hip because it's like, you know, hard to, you know, get in there and play and all that and build these things, whatever.
1464920	1489035	for some reason I was reminded of a really old game on the Super Nintendo called Populous where you could kind of build and this is also on I want to say like Amiga I think it was originally an Amiga game and obviously I had a PC port at some point too and you like raised and lowered land to keep your people safe and you kind of like played God so to speak I don't know why but with the whole like building blocks and then taking them away I
1491938	1496564	I feel like I've played something like it before.
1496604	1498126	It didn't feel that innovative to me.
1498786	1499687	So, sorry.
1500228	1501410	I guess that makes me not cool.
1501690	1502211	I'm not hip.
1502231	1503773	I don't think it's cool either.
1507120	1533479	Other housekeeping, you can always join us on Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR Just the abbreviation there If you want to follow us there, and of course check us out on our website www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com No shows we're taking off in the foreseeable future We do have our 9th anniversary show coming up at the end of June But that's still a good 6 weeks away So we'll give you more details on that as we get closer

1561872	1562672	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.
1562692	1563913	PlayStation Network's been down?
1565833	1566594	Yes, it's been down.
1567554	1576937	I don't know if you've actually bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 or Mortal Kombat, which were huge, huge releases on PS3 the week you were out, and now you can't play either of them online.
1577157	1577617	Yeah.
1579017	1580338	Never used PlayStation Network.
1582499	1584619	But yeah, it's been down for a while.
1585299	1586760	And, you know, they even...
1588698	1591559	They even went and had a press conference yesterday.
1592299	1593760	Ooh, press conference.
1594280	1595461	Making everything official.
1596421	1597241	Hey, don't fear.
1597421	1598922	Everything's gonna be okay.
1600062	1604664	But yeah, apparently they're gonna be returning some services to the PlayStation Network this week.
1604804	1606345	Full services within this month.
1607922	1611746	And, uh, I just need to interrupt and say something because this is really important, Loki.
1612266	1624516	Um, part of, you know, kind of the, the thing that, you know, with the hack and everything is that credit card data was exposed, or at least they say, possibly could have been compromised, which hadn't come out at the time of last week's show.
1624657	1626858	And I just want to say, I called it.
1627019	1627219	Yep.
1627539	1629781	And, uh, I really hate being right sometimes.
1629881	1632402	That's the second time this year I've been right on some major news.
1632722	1639886	The other one we'll get to in a little bit because I've not had a chance to gloat with Loki here on the show but I'll get my fair share in just after we cover this story.
1641278	1641678	All right.
1643079	1670138	Yeah, so the list of services that are returning to the PlayStation Network this week are the restoration of online gameplay across the PlayStation 3 and PSP systems, and it says including tiles that require online verification and download games, access to music unlimited power by Curiosity, which I might add, Curiosity is a terrible name for a service, so thanks, Sony, for coming up with a new word that begins with Q. All right.
1672330	1674471	Access to account management and password reset.
1674531	1678493	Well, that's important considering that our account's been breached and we need to change their passwords.
1678513	1679434	You're not going to have a choice.
1679874	1681995	They're going to make you change your password when you come back on.
1682015	1683076	That's a big part of it.
1683476	1690860	Not only that, you have to do it from the original PS3 or an email thing because some people have changed their PlayStation 3s.
1692461	1697885	PlayStation Home, Friendslist, and Chat Functionality are coming back.
1701768	1704270	And then some other fun stuff, of course.
1705011	1716259	They're also going to be, as their Welcome Back program, they're going to be offering some free stuff for you because they're sorry...
1717361	1727533	Um, so the free stuff that they're going to be offering, uh, a free download with, uh, I believe they are saying that was worth, uh, $20 maybe?
1728814	1732439	Um, and then 30 days free of PlayStation Plus.
1734480	1738082	Curocity, 30 Days of Curocity, and a download.
1759526	1764489	Even though all your personal information has been stolen, one download should make you forget all about that, right?
1764749	1764849	Eh?
1765029	1765289	Yeah?
1765529	1765809	Yeah?
1766750	1766950	No?
1767550	1767810	Maybe?
1770212	1772012	They didn't really say the download price.
1772893	1777795	Kazurai was saying a few thousand yen worth of free downloads, so like $20 or $25.
1780658	1782679	and, um, yeah, that's interesting.
1783960	1791903	Um, and then, of course, uh, there's gonna be a new PlayStation 3 firmware accompanying with the relaunch of the PlayStation Network.
1792423	1797946	And they're saying that the network is physically being rebuilt, um, because apparently it was just inferior as it was.
1798506	1801988	You know, it might help that if they didn't, you know, store these same, uh,
1802748	1809110	On the same servers, your credit card information and all that stuff with the servers that actually sell product.
1809710	1815511	You might want to keep that stuff separate in case one gets hacked or the store gets hacked, which is more likely.
1816852	1817972	So they're going to be doing that.
1818852	1830195	And of course, to make them sound like they're really on top of it, well, it's something we were planning on doing anyway, so we're just going to do it quicker now.
1831809	1832770	We were on top of this!
1853360	1860428	are now forming task forces or sending inquiries about what's going on.
1860448	1866854	So I guess Homeland Security and the FBI are going to be helping them out, investigating the data breach and all that stuff.
1869497	1871159	So I guess that's supposed to make us feel good.
1872280	1874262	So great, our tax money is going to...
1875703	1877425	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1895059	1898502	Getting access to the store through custom firmware or something like that.
1899082	1900663	Or some development side or something.
1901244	1901544	I don't know.
1901564	1902865	What if they staged this whole thing?
1903185	1906227	No, the whole thing is... Here's what it was.
1906508	1910210	It was really terrible because all they were doing the entire time was... Oh, those hackers!
1910250	1911171	Those hackers got in!
1911909	1919896	And yet there was never, oh, well, we're stupid and we didn't, you know, first off, we didn't encrypt any of your personal data.
1921057	1921837	That's funny, you know.
1922158	1923379	We'll laugh about that later on.
1923919	1929504	And then second, you know, their servers were the same servers for, you know, all that stuff.
1929984	1930625	It's ridiculous.
1930825	1931866	Okay, now you may.
1933309	1936711	Um, I'm not going to be a satisfied PlayStation customer.
1938352	1948997	You can throw all this free shit at me, although I don't think, honestly, and this is one of the pro-Sony things I'm going to say, because I don't consider myself a Sony fanboy or an Xbox fanboy or any of it.
1950098	1957621	I chew out everyone equally, because I love gaming, and these companies screw things up, and it's usually at a management level.
1957701	1958562	It makes me angry.
1959889	1967254	And what makes me, the free stuff here, I don't think actually Sony really owes you anything for free because the network was free in the first place.
1967354	1971197	And, you know, if your credit card gets hacked, you don't ask the bank for free money.
1971897	1979322	I mean, you have a protection with your bank that the bank will, you know, if you have a fraudulent charge, you're protected against that.
1979342	1983445	If you have any type of decent credit card or bank, you're protected against fraud and all that stuff.
1989229	1989610	DarkSakura.com
2006053	2009675	If you weren't monitoring your stuff before, you're an idiot.
2010776	2015518	Sorry, but this should have been a severe wake-up call to you if you haven't been monitoring your stuff before.
2015858	2019600	Because you could get your stuff stolen from a gas pump from one of those readers.
2019880	2023923	You could get your stuff stolen from any clerk or any waiter at a restaurant that you give your cards to.
2024483	2026624	Your card number gets out there exposed all the time.
2026944	2028645	You have to monitor that stuff.
2028685	2031867	And if this didn't serve as a wake-up call to you, I don't know what to tell you.
2032307	2035869	Honestly, the best way around any real risk is use cash.
2037110	2040793	Well, I suppose there's that too, but I don't want to be Tim Foyle hat either.
2041673	2045396	My agreement with the bank, I'm fucking paying Visa, right?
2045456	2052841	Because there's either the interest that they're making off the credit card to begin with, or in the case of debit cards, they take a percentage of the sale and so forth.
2053161	2056103	These companies are paid to prevent fraud.
2058709	2063492	My problem here is, I need to hear more about how Sony is going to prevent this from happening again.
2064512	2067194	I understand they're hiring a privacy officer, which is fine.
2067654	2071956	I understand that they're moving their data center, whether it was planned already or not, whatever.
2072297	2074478	At least they're finally understanding, whoops, we fucked up.
2074658	2078260	And it's kind of one of those, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
2078280	2085804	Because if they put the damn thing back up, and then they just get hacked again, they're going to be dead as a company.
2086344	2086704	Period.
2086744	2086885	Well,
2088165	2092768	It's just like when Jack in the Box killed the people with E.C.O.L.I.E.
2092868	2094470	That was probably about 15 years ago.
2095110	2102215	Right after that happened, they were the safest restaurant to eat at because you knew if they were going to mess up again, they would be out of business, every single one of them.
2102555	2105357	And they've been able to recover from what was an unfortunate mess.
2105417	2110981	Now, obviously, very different scenarios because you're talking lives are not at stake in this scenario, what's going on with Sony.
2111281	2117185	However, there still is certainly a big passion, big headline news thing going on here.
2118125	2130456	So, there's some other things to consider, though, is that what Sony got is that Sony needs to kind of ask themselves, you know, how are we going to prevent the hacking happening in the future?
2130976	2132698	I'm not condoning the hacking at all.
2133218	2135200	And, you know, because I see some stuff going on in the chatroom.
2135220	2136020	I want to make it clear.
2136741	2139563	The ultimate problem is not with Sony.
2139623	2143367	It's with the hackers and whoever went into the system in the first place.
2143747	2144888	They are the problem.
2145368	2146029	Let's be real.
2146389	2151694	If they try to use that credit card data that was stolen at this point, they're going to have the FBI up their ass.
2152254	2164966	If you're a hacker that did this or you're somebody that buys this data from the hackers, you are an absolute moron who's just begging to go to jail because you're going to have every state agency so far up your butt.
2165226	2166067	I mean, let's be real.
2166187	2168509	So if you do have that data, you really shouldn't use it.
2170393	2171414	Let's be fair, okay?
2171875	2174278	Now, and so I certainly don't condone that.
2174318	2187232	That's, you know, hacking to that level where you are stealing information, whatever, and if they are trying to sell it for a profit, as some folks are saying, it's up on forums and so forth, but, you know, what's real and what's trolling?
2187533	2187953	We don't know.
2188113	2189155	You know, where's the line drawn?
2189435	2190656	So I don't condone the hacking.
2191363	2197528	However, you can't help but feel like Sony kind of opened themselves up to it a little bit.
2198289	2202233	Didn't Sony kind of come out in the schoolyard and kind of wave their hand saying, come at us?
2203311	2208535	How many times do they get up there on the stage at E3 and say, our system is unhackable?
2208555	2208955	Wait, wait, wait.
2209235	2223325	Just throwing this out there, and I'm not sure on the accuracy of the rumor, but let's just pretend that it's real here, because it would fall in line with the lack of dedication to safety, I guess, or of our information.
2223866	2232192	Apparently, the rumor is that that credit card list was encrypted with the same keys that they use for the PlayStation 3.
2234198	2234578	Oops.
2236700	2241463	So the point is, and what I really want to get at here, and this is how Sony can really earn back my trust.
2242183	2245866	Stop being so fucking hard headed.
2247147	2249828	It is time to admit your vulnerability.
2250369	2252490	And this press conference yesterday didn't cut it.
2253171	2259515	It didn't cut it because essentially they came out there and they just, you know, they're trying to point fingers at everybody else except themselves.
2261363	2264368	and honestly what really needs to happen is management needs to be shaken up.
2264689	2266311	Kaz Harai needs to come down.
2267193	2267473	Sorry.
2268235	2272321	That's what is really going to make me happy is for PlayStation to change their management.
2272582	2274285	However, unfortunately I don't see that happening.
2274711	2280758	I think what's going to restore a lot of faith that customers might have in them is for them to display that level of accountability.
2281399	2284242	Accountability for me, especially, is a big thing with a company.
2284762	2289227	And if I'm seeing none of that, then I'm not going to give them my business.
2290108	2294172	I mean, that's why I've pretty much decided I don't think I'm going to get anything else for PS3.
2295441	2319030	at the end of the day I think Sony can win me back I mean it's not like corporations don't do dumb things once in a while and excuse me Xbox fanboys excuse me the Red Ring of Death thing was atrocious and was horrible on Microsoft's part but they've come a long way since then to be fair and they finally did extend their warranty and they admitted their problem that's what I need Sony to do here
2321647	2325429	But I don't... Until they have some accountability, I don't think I'm going to give them my business.
2327571	2334295	I mean, but it's a hard situation because, you know, I can see how some of you are thinking, well, Rob, is that saying what the hackers did is okay?
2334935	2336196	No, that's not what I'm saying.
2336476	2337997	What the hackers did is not okay.
2338818	2341039	But you know what I've said on the show before, hackers are going to hack.
2341079	2345342	And, you know, this news, we've seen this stuff about Sony and so forth.
2345902	2347343	They really have just been inviting it.
2347383	2348204	This whole thing about...
2348684	2375892	We want to subpoena everybody's PlayStation 3 that ever accessed a website even remotely related to this Geohots thing When he admitted he wasn't even coming after data in the first place He just wanted to get the other OS thing back or whatever I mean, let's be real, this all traces back to Sony taking off the other OS feature If Sony had never done that, this would have never happened Yeah, but hindsight, you know Right, but maybe it needed to happen
2377336	2401568	Maybe we were all getting a little too comfortable with this whole digital distribution thing Maybe this, you know, and I've said this before on the show and I still mean it This is going to set digital distribution back a little bit because this goes beyond Sony This is going to affect that horrific copyright protection thing that Capcom has If you bought a game like Bionic Commander or whatever you haven't been able to play it for the past 11 days on PlayStation 3
2402708	2404970	and we're having class action lawsuits against only Sony.
2405470	2405870	I'm sorry.
2405930	2407351	Someone needs to file one against Capcom.
2408011	2408212	Yeah.
2408372	2408672	Sorry.
2409072	2410333	I can't play a game I bought.
2410613	2413195	That's kind of your problem.
2415056	2416116	That's what I like to see happen.
2416357	2416857	No, I agree.
2418986	2427488	Alright, I'm going to the chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Derek H in our chatroom says, I would like a press release saying they've hired a hit team to track down and assassinate the hackers.
2427808	2431729	You know what's interesting, I did feel like at that press conference day they were really trying to finger point at Anonymous.
2432570	2441752	They don't even know who did it, and I know they keep saying, well it could be Anonymous, but they said they didn't do it, but there's no head to Anonymous, so it could have been another cell of Anonymous.
2442250	2447432	Yeah, but the whole thing was I think is people used Anonymous because there was that whole conflict going.
2447933	2455376	So whoever it was that was planning on doing this probably said, oh, now seems like a good time because they're going to be looking at them or be distracted by them.
2455456	2457097	And so that's when they went and did it.
2457917	2472206	and if it was actually what the rumor is where that it was part of this rebug firmware that was out there that gave you basically development access that you could actually download content for free and stuff.
2472246	2482073	That was one of the rumors I heard that one of the reasons that they took the store down because someone found a way to basically steal PlayStation Network content
2482913	2484434	I don't know.
2510494	2513116	It's like, oh, well, that doesn't sound very sure of yourself now.
2513357	2514417	That's a CYA move.
2516239	2520582	Ranma says, and also, I guarantee that a few people may have lost their jobs over this.
2521283	2523084	It's always unfortunate for job loss.
2523364	2531390	I just hope the right people lost their jobs over this because if it was the people down in the trenches, that's not who needs to be losing their jobs over it.
2532011	2534553	I don't want to just go off speculation either.
2534593	2537035	If Sony shook up their management, I want to see the receipts.
2539811	2567239	going to the chat room with some more comments here Ranma says Sky yes Microsoft got a black eye for the Red Ring of Death but Microsoft stepped up to the plates and handled it when people bitched at Nintendo about the Wiimotes they stepped up now that people are bitching to Sony they turn a blind eye and say there's not a problem Jedi mind trick my ass absolutely right that's my whole point and I don't think that press conference yesterday cut it and I really don't know what is to blame except the management at Sony
2568600	2570782	It's being a poorly managed company right now.
2572843	2573364	That's that.
2575543	2582125	Uh, let's see, also, um, some other folks in chat, uh, Defective Candy saying, Gah, it wasn't Anon!
2582225	2583246	Bangs her head against the desk.
2583626	2599811	Well, I mean, the only problem Anon has is that because it is the way it is, and I'm not knocking Anon, like, you know, whatever, it's just a subculture of the internet, but the problem with Anon is because it has no face, it's really easy to point the finger at them.
2600111	2611077	It's easy for Kazurai to get up there and say, well, Anon was in our systems, and Anon did this hacking, and we're sending the FBI and the top people on this, and we're going to make an example out of some of those Anon kids.
2611117	2612197	It's very easy to blame them.
2614599	2615879	Well, good luck.
2615899	2622022	They have yet to find any of these people anyways, and how are they going to prove who did it?
2622182	2623323	That's the best thing about it.
2623363	2624564	It's tough.
2624584	2629106	The smartest thing any type of vigilante group can do on top of that is to be completely decentralized.
2633501	2638242	DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, I don't think that's necessarily related to anything about Geohots or Anonymous.
2638262	2639702	Sony has a lot of other enemies.
2642063	2648965	Perhaps everything else that was going on with the other companies showed the real person who hacked all this how easy it was to do.
2649565	2654686	Maybe, I still think though a lot of what happened leading up to this helped whoever did it.
2655186	2658927	We've got an email coming up that's got a pretty interesting suggestion, so I'm going to
2659787	2660107	Alright.
2661388	2673435	Here's my suggestion, though, is all this free stuff you're throwing my way, like free download and free PlayStation Plus and free Curiosity, I don't care about two-thirds of that.
2673515	2687903	And the download, I might not even care about that either, so... I mean, that's like saying... Imagine, if you will, Rob, that you went to a restaurant, a nice restaurant or whatever, or not even necessarily a nice restaurant.
2688123	2688804	Say you went to
2690322	2690963	Jack in the Box.
2691023	2692203	We'll use Jack in the Box again.
2692724	2707875	And you went there and you bought something and someone stole your credit card information, stole your identity, and you found out, you went to the management, and they're like, here's a voucher for a free jumbo jack.
2709917	2710357	Sorry.
2711358	2713079	I mean, would that cut it with you?
2713179	2716942	I mean, I would be kind of like,
2718857	2719097	Really?
2720698	2721718	This is what you're giving me?
2723679	2724400	Here's the thing, though.
2724640	2729402	I'm not fully convinced that only Sony is vulnerable to a hack like this.
2730922	2734704	And we've heard of other personal data being compromised on other websites and so forth.
2735084	2745109	So I'm not sure I fully believe that my information is 100% secure with Microsoft, with one of their online services, Steam, with Blizzard,
2746036	2746757	I don't know.
2747177	2749079	But I'm not going to freak out about it.
2749119	2760611	I'm not going to panic and I'm not going to cancel all my credit cards and all that stuff because the money I pay to have a debit or credit card in the first place is supposed to pay to protect me from the fraud.
2762532	2764794	So, I'm not that worried about it.
2765154	2771619	And, I can thank the PlayStation Network for being so useless to me that the last time I used my credit card, it had expired that same month!
2771699	2772639	So, ha ha ha!
2773440	2774861	You have old credit card information.
2774981	2776322	Good luck spending that money.
2776622	2782246	Dan was saying right before the show, though, is that the one time he finally decided to buy something on PlayStation Network, that was when Moondiver came out.
2782666	2784248	Because it's done by the dude that did Strider.
2786569	2788391	Then all this goes down, and he's like, well, shit.
2788511	2788771	Shit.
2790807	2793208	Other than that, we never really used PlayStation Network.
2793268	2794429	I had zero interest in it.
2794549	2800814	I didn't make a profile until we had our system for two years, if that's any indication, when I was playing Final Fantasy XIII.
2802935	2808440	Let me go back to this, too, in our chatroom, because this is a good point, and it came up on my Twitter earlier, but it hasn't come up yet on the show here tonight.
2808801	2812204	TigerCon, our chatroom, says, You don't have to worry about Nintendo getting hacked.
2812324	2815007	They don't hold any personal info other than friend codes.
2815647	2827439	Well, now, despite the shit we've given Nintendo over the years about being so fucking far behind the times when it comes to online stuff, right now, their way of handling credit card payments looks pretty fucking good.
2828829	2829530	In light of all this?
2829970	2832772	I would rather have security than convenience.
2833973	2837817	Just so you know, the Nintendo Wii makes you put in your complete credit card info every time.
2838157	2838877	It doesn't save it.
2839158	2840599	And sometimes they can get a little frustrating.
2840619	2842801	It's like, here I am, putting it in again on the Wiimote.
2843041	2845283	But right now, that system looks pretty darn good.
2847955	2849476	No, it doesn't because I'm sorry.
2850076	2853378	Not that I'd actually buy anything on Virtual Console right now.
2853478	2853978	I don't care.
2855419	2858301	Let's praise Nintendo for being lazy.
2858501	2860762	I'm not saying praise them.
2861402	2872028	I'm just saying it's ironic how this all kind of works out where Nintendo has really nothing to lose with what happened here because of the fact they're so far behind the times.
2872368	2875770	So my only point is that maybe we were moving ahead too fast.
2876564	2877244	People are motivated by spite.
2899606	2907833	If you're trying to... People like being competitive and people like challenging things that you're giving them, especially a company.
2908053	2911656	They like looking at the company as the evil corporate giant.
2912076	2921164	And if you go and say, well, good luck doing that, people are going to take the David and Goliath route and they're going to try to bring Goliath down.
2922585	2927347	And, you know, for every hundred people that try and fail, someone's going to do it.
2927567	2929867	So, you know how you avoid that?
2930227	2932748	You don't go saying, try to hack me.
2935109	2939830	Looking in the chat room at chat.orange.com, there's lots of interesting stuff going on in the chat room right now.
2940550	2940890	Let's see.
2941010	2943511	Spazinator in our chat room says, I really didn't expect any freebies.
2943891	2947392	All I'd like is an I'm sorry and assurance that they're learning from their mistakes.
2947512	2947852	Thank you.
2948273	2949533	That would be great, actually.
2950554	2955918	Derek H in our chat says, Sky, that's like saying a horse and carriage looks good after you get into a car accident.
2956219	2964265	You know, it's really funny that you use that as an example because my mom has a true diagnosed fear of driving cars and vehicles and all that.
2964706	2969250	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that she just didn't like them whatever growing up or what have you.
2969670	2975295	And the one time she decided to buck her fear and get behind the wheel of a car after going through the process, getting a license, all that stuff,
2975575	2975655	Well,
2997462	3024880	I actually will say this I do prefer Nintendo's method of not storing the information because whenever I pay the only I think online thing ever that has my information saved is my PayPal which I used to pay for any online service now because I can stop my information from PayPal and the site won't have my information or my WoW subscription but other than that nowhere else has my information
3025764	3033031	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, you know, the Battlestar Galactica wasn't affected by the Cylon attack because it didn't use as much future technology as the other Battlestars.
3033111	3033871	Excellent point, Bobby.
3034872	3036674	At least somebody's on the same wavelength as me.
3038735	3039056	All right.
3039516	3041678	I, yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.
3042619	3043960	You know, that hasn't already been said.
3044180	3047223	I just, where's the, I'm sorry.
3047243	3047383	Sorry.
3048680	3049400	We'll see what happens.
3050141	3050661	Moving on.
3050981	3055804	I do have another story that's kind of in the same vein as a lot of this stuff, if you will.
3056684	3058565	And what did I say was the root cause of all of this?
3058745	3062567	Sony removing the other OWASP feature in the past.
3063087	3067410	And interesting enough, Sony's troubles may not be over as far as that's concerned.
3067810	3071672	They've actually lost what could be a landmark decision in this whole thing.
3071792	3072792	Now, here's the deal.
3072852	3076935	It's not as major as it might seem, but it happened in Finland.
3078715	3080997	And it happened by what's called a consumer's board.
3081077	3083438	It is a ruling, but it's a consumer's board.
3083518	3099666	It's not necessarily a government legitimate courtroom ruling, but the consumer's board in Finland has decided that this man who actually took Sony to court over removing the other OS feature, that Sony needs to cough up 100 euros for doing it.
3100796	3102497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3126215	3134499	The CCB said that the removal of other OS crippled console features that were present at the time of purchase and agreed that consumers should be compensated.
3134959	3140021	It recommended that the manufacturer and seller of the console pay 100 euros jointly to compensate the man.
3140541	3149025	The CCB does not have the power to enforce the ruling, but the opinion of this board in Finland is considered by the courts in a dispute.
3150045	3153707	Meaning if it does go to court, this will weigh heavily on what happens.
3154527	3156849	So, interesting.
3157950	3164195	I guess if Sony truly thought their system... Well, this also kind of goes back to Sony being hard-headed.
3164635	3169539	Sony put the other OS feature in there because they were convinced it could not be used to hack their system because it was unhackable.
3169799	3172861	The minute they found it, it was hackable, they removed it.
3173022	3174663	Well, maybe you shouldn't have put it there in the first place!
3177002	3181505	And still, though, it's like saying, you know, oh, well, this feature, no one's really using this feature.
3182566	3189150	Okay, it's a feature on something, and you remove it, people are going to be pissed, because it is, somebody is obviously using it.
3189250	3191631	If no one was using it, why'd you put it there in the first place?
3193132	3195474	I mean, that's like saying, oh, Spanish language?
3195874	3197935	No one uses a Spanish language.
3198695	3200336	They can just speak English or French.
3200356	3201097	Yeah.
3202802	3203503	So there you go.
3203703	3205305	It'll be interesting to see what develops with that.
3205345	3207067	Sony's troubles may not be over.
3207407	3214755	We're going to be talking about the legal team moving from whatever was going on with Geohots to now having to deal with class action lawsuits over the downtime.
3215616	3219661	This whole other OS lawsuit and there's a whole other nightmare of problems.
3221647	3223948	I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing in the background right now.
3223988	3224728	That's all I hear.
3225128	3225428	Yeah.
3225648	3229149	Anyhow, DarkSakura, don't you have something, just something to take my mind off all this other stuff?
3229169	3229789	How about some good news?
3229949	3230409	How about it?
3230669	3232310	How about something for Portal 2?
3233270	3235990	There's going to be a new download content this summer.
3236651	3241152	Valve put out an announcement and it's free, which is great.
3241492	3250954	It'll be called DLC number one and it will have new test chambers, leaderboards, challenge mode for single and multiplayer, quote, and more, end quote.
3251434	3270562	It will be on all platforms Mac, PC, Xbox 360 And maybe Playstation 3 Maybe If the system's up It'll be on PS3 I'm just making a poke But hey, that's pretty cool And I so much love the game already That it'd be kind of neat to have some new stuff to do
3272042	3283865	You gotta admit though, every developer, every single one of them who makes money off DLC, who makes money off designing games specifically for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network platforms has gotta be looking at what's going on right now.
3284385	3285446	11 days of lost sales.
3285646	3286306	But this is free.
3286666	3289767	I know, this is free, but it just reminds me of that whole thing.
3290307	3293548	That's why I'm saying the impact on the whole digital distribution thing will be felt.
3295106	3297628	Anyhow, I like free things, though.
3297708	3300890	I hope we do get more maps and things that let this game live on.
3300950	3301530	It'd be great.
3301850	3308434	I think it's a good value as it is, but just if they enhance that value, especially if they have a map editor for people, oh my gosh.
3308955	3313357	I think that's one of the things I was hearing about going to be coming out, actually, is that they're... Awesome.
3314318	3316239	Valve's always been kind of cool, though.
3316599	3317760	You know what Gary's mod is, right?
3318200	3319281	Mm-hmm.
3319361	3323984	The modding community is really big out there, and they've paid to put some development into some of this.
3324545	3335062	so they're seeing people doing the same thing with Portal and are encouraging it and I think they're supposed to have I remembered hearing something about them having some sort of level sharing coming out
3336034	3337996	There was some fan wank discussion last night.
3338016	3344180	I want to say it was one I was on WOW about talking about how awesome it would be if there was a Tron-themed portal level or something like that.
3344200	3348403	And I'm like, that fan wank could be a reality if they do release some of these map editors and things.
3348423	3349204	Somebody will be on that.
3349264	3349664	You know it.
3350265	3354128	It's ironic, but the orange and blue would fit very well with the Tron universe, wouldn't it?
3354588	3356629	So, we'll see.
3356810	3357790	Yeah, and considering...
3359332	3359952	Yeah, actually it would.
3360452	3366114	Can you imagine like a deathmatch portal type thing or like four player portal or something?
3367674	3368494	Deathmatch portal?
3368914	3369214	I don't know.
3371275	3371615	I don't know.
3372535	3377917	There's part of me that wants to say, no, they should think about the more competitive stuff when Portal 3 comes out.
3378237	3381377	And there's a part of me that says, actually, Portal 3 should probably never come out.
3382178	3383258	I don't think there should be a Portal 3.
3385458	3390001	You know, maybe it's like one of those movies that really doesn't need a sequel.
3390461	3392823	I don't see at all possible how there could be a Portal 3.
3393763	3403149	Well, where there's money to be made, there is always... They're saying though that for Half-Life 3 that What's-Your-Face Chell is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.
3403990	3410414	Yeah, speaking of like Valve and things that end in 3, I'm not so sure that's a possibility with Valve actually.
3411707	3413649	Have they ever gotten to three in their series?
3414009	3418373	Half-Life 3 Episode 3 is supposed to be... Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
3419214	3420715	Episode 3 is a myth, okay.
3420735	3421536	Yeah, let's see.
3421616	3422416	Left 4 Dead.
3422616	3423998	Well, the first two came out real quick.
3424038	3425179	Then there was never a third one.
3425679	3426460	Portal.
3426800	3427461	Well, we'll see.
3428221	3428922	Yeah, I don't know.
3428962	3430023	Did they ever get to three?
3431484	3432905	I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing.
3432925	3433426	I'm just, you know...
3434249	3434449	VALVE
3450669	3455072	Yeah, this could finally be where they do drop the bombshell about Half-Life Episode 3, but I don't know.
3455272	3457874	Or Left 4 Dead 3 with a portal gun in there.
3458695	3460016	Or maybe something new.
3460376	3463658	I mean, I kind of trust Valve with new ideas right now, you know?
3464099	3470503	They've had a lot of good stuff, like Left 4 Dead, great game, often copied, portal, excellent little thing.
3470563	3473425	I mean, I'm all for whatever they come out with next.
3473465	3477468	I believe one of the things they have on the horizon is their whole Defense of the Ancients.
3477948	3479670	Dota... I think it's called Dota 2?
3480610	3509590	Haha, another two Yeah, they have an official Dota thing coming out Which was originally a Warcraft 3 mod But they hired the people that made it It's not the same thing as League of Legends In fact, League of Legends is kind of The Defense of the Ancients thing has gone a million different ways Because Blizzard has their own thing coming to StarCraft League of Legends is out there too By I believe some of the people that were involved with Dota in the beginning And then the people that got hired from Valve For Dota have the official Dota 2 game coming out And I think that's probably what you're going to see Most of at E3 this year out of Valve
3512014	3530588	anyhow free stuff yeah free stuff is good and I'm all for continuing to expand the terrific game that is Portal 2 but I would honestly still be happy with my purchase if they never expanded it but I think I'm still having fun oh yeah absolutely I just think it's a great value anyhow Loki let's move on
3532069	3532490	Ah, yes.
3533030	3541677	And the other big story that was floating around the web, of course, is the oft-rumored sequel console for the Wii.
3541737	3544179	Obviously, I mean, there's going to be a new console from Nintendo at some point.
3545821	3554268	Now, Nintendo has officially announced that, yes, they will be talking about a successor to the Wii, not necessarily a Wii 2, but another console, coming for 2012.
3554308	3555369	And, of course, they're saying...
3560838	3584001	you know it's gonna be shown off at E3 it's gonna be playable at E3 probably if you're pressing behind doors but you know it will be playable it'll be their thing that has the uber long line to play yes that's been Nintendo's E3 motif for years minus the airport years and of course you know tons of rumors about what it is and Project Cafe and all that fun stuff
3584501	3588364	Just so you know, last week we talked at length about this, because a lot of the rumors had come out.
3588484	3590205	Now we have the confirmation.
3590225	3593148	Nintendo's saying, okay, yes, it's happening, and we'll see you at E3.
3594168	3595209	That's the news from this week.
3595309	3597351	Last week we talked at length about a lot of that stuff, just so you know.
3597851	3599012	Which, by the way, would include...
3601262	3608645	When I, in January, on this program said, Nintendo is showing a new console at E3 this year because they've got nothing going for them on the Wii right now but that new Zelda game.
3608965	3611186	And you, Loki, said, no.
3611706	3612487	No, they're not going to show.
3612547	3614187	No, the Wii still prints money.
3614207	3615888	They're not going to show a new console at E3.
3616268	3618189	So I just wanted to say, thank you.
3619770	3624132	Okay, but you're still wrong with them not having anything coming out on the Wii.
3625635	3626716	What's coming out on the Wii?
3647091	3648193	They need something for Christmas this year.
3648213	3651697	If the system isn't coming out until 2012, and to be fair, I had speculated, why are they waiting until 2012?
3651737	3652898	But I guess they did the same thing with the 3DS.
3652938	3653920	They do need something this year.
3666255	3669636	and I actually think you calling the new Super Mario Bros.
3669676	3694506	sequel I think is a distinct possibility for the rabbit out of their hat for the Wii this year I know you guys talked about this last week but I wasn't here so I'm just going to get my take on a lot of this and you love Nintendo more than anyone on this show so definitely wonder what your opinion is listen, we gotta think like Nintendo here and why they're doing what they're doing here's how it's going to all work I think let's take the name Project Cafe
3695754	3696494	What is a cafe?
3696515	3699556	A cafe is a place that you go gather with your friends.
3699616	3701357	It's a very casual meeting place.
3701818	3705480	Lots of chatting and interactivity and that kind of stuff.
3705540	3713745	So maybe now the focus is going to be and that would be great if they actually did it more like online.
3713785	3719368	Kind of think of like Facebook stuff where you're sharing stuff with your friends.
3719488	3721429	You're conversing.
3721530	3723691	It's very casual stuff.
3724901	3727871	I don't know, lots of online content we'd hope
3730509	3735313	Sorry, I have to say, SJ100Matt in the chatroom says, Rob, the Christmas hot seller is the Vitality Sensor.
3736554	3738935	I guarantee you the Vitality Sensor is dead.
3739195	3740336	It's been swept under the rug.
3740877	3748602	However, you may see it rear its little ugly head on whatever, like, you know, just a little piece of metal on the back of some controller.
3749222	3751484	Nintendo will never fully scrap an idea.
3751784	3755907	It will rear its ugly head again at some point, but as far as the Wii Vitality Sensor...
3756207	3758669	No, it got laughed out of submission.
3759690	3760571	Sorry, Loki.
3760591	3762412	So anyways, you may see something like that.
3763733	3767977	But this is Nintendo we're talking about here, so I don't know if they're actually going to do that.
3768037	3778205	I would hope that now, being that this is the next generation of consoles, they would understand that, yes, okay, online gaming is something that people do want.
3778505	3779386	You know, social...
3781690	3803740	community features something that people do like having because Facebook is popular all this stuff's popular let's let's bring it in okay so let's assume that they're gonna do oh god that's why the controllers are all touch screens because they're gonna want you to take them out in public just like the 3ds they're gonna want you to take those things with you wherever you go so when you meet people you could like do the game data trades just like the 3ds
3804958	3805679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3821252	3822314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3836255	3836916	DarkSakura.com
3851754	3852435	I think it's that.
3852555	3854396	But like a fucking iPad as a controller?
3854536	3854697	No.
3854797	3856378	No, it's not anything like that.
3857279	3862963	If anything, I would see maybe it's some sort... Because you have to also understand, Nintendo's not going to compete with themselves.
3863263	3867466	Why would they release something that could be used as a portable gaming device when they have a portable gaming device?
3867546	3868427	It doesn't make any sense.
3869007	3873391	If anything, they would want you to use your 3DS or something like that for some sort of connectivity, but...
3875032	3875673	Whatever, okay?
3875753	3877494	And then the other thing, too, is the cost of this thing.
3877514	3882339	I mean, if this controller's like $100, people are like, fuck that, I ain't buying a $100 controller.
3882639	3884481	I think the 3DS will stand in as a controller.
3884961	3886943	I think that's how they don't bite themselves in the foot.
3887023	3889025	It's a controller that will also do the 3D display.
3889706	3891888	Okay, so let's just assume, okay, let's say that...
3893206	3897151	I mean, don't get me wrong, they could come up with some really low quality screen.
3897431	3901095	I mean, look at the PlayStation 1 little monitors that were 50 bucks or whatever.
3901496	3907643	I mean, you put a touch screen display on top of there, a touch panel display, you could kind of jerry-rig something like that.
3908063	3908204	So...
3908624	3912307	Anyways, so let's say that's going to happen.
3913968	3915549	That'd be interesting, I guess.
3915829	3919371	But they're also saying that they're still going to keep the original controls as well.
3919852	3925936	Because, like I'm expecting, this system's probably just going to upscale these old Wii games.
3926096	3930719	You know how you see all this emulator footage with 1080p new Super Mario Bros.
3930739	3932180	and stuff like that and how it looks really pretty?
3933817	3934237	There you go!
3934897	3938459	Your games are brand new again and we can still sell Wii games.
3940019	3942360	I think they're either going to take one of two approaches.
3942400	3947962	They're either going to try to get everybody to go up onto this new platform or they're going to try to keep this platform along with the Wii.
3948362	3956225	You have the Wii for the casual people that don't want to spend a lot of money on stuff and then you have this new system for the hardcore players that really want something that has the graphics and all that.
3956685	3957325	But guess what though?
3957365	3961426	If you have those Wii games that you want to buy, they look really pretty on your new HD...
3964027	3970309	I hate to say, I think you are on the money on this.
3970509	3971049	I really do.
3971689	3983532	I hate saying when you're, I think when you talk about this, yeah, and it's funny because somebody in chat, who said this in chat, said Amiga777 in chat said, please no illusions, the dolphin GameCube had next to nothing to do with water.
3985287	3991091	But I honestly think, like, what's the one place where everybody always razzes Nintendo online?
3991811	3993352	What does Nintendo want a piece of?
3993792	3995113	What everybody's into?
3995714	3998235	That's what the Wii was all about, was trying to get everybody into gaming.
3998315	4002478	Don't think they don't look at Facebook and say, hmm, how could we get a part of this?
4003038	4004940	I just hope... This is the Facebook console.
4004960	4010984	But I just really hope that they don't try to do some stupid gimmick with this touchscreen thing, because...
4011864	4021553	Honestly, I don't need another fucking gimmick from Nintendo I mean, let's just stop Nintendo is a fucking lazy company I'm sorry, they are a fucking lazy company And you know why?
4021814	4032744	Because they will take the least amount of effort to put out a new game I mean, they're porting old shit for the 3DS Okay, great, you're updating stuff Why don't you create a damn new game?
4032964	4034706	You can do it in the same style as the old game
4034986	4040910	You know, you did the same thing with, like, you know, the Wind Waker looking stuff on, you know, the DS.
4042491	4043712	Or, I guess, Wind Waker, yeah.
4044172	4050957	So, you did it, like, on the DS, but, you know, why can't you just create new games that look like the old games?
4051718	4054240	Why do you have to port the old games over?
4054520	4058843	It's because you don't want, you want to spend the least amount of time possible working on this shit.
4059303	4061505	Because people will buy it, no matter what you put out.
4062165	4064786	So what's the least possible effort that they could put in a new console?
4064906	4065447	Oh, I don't know.
4065827	4068048	Something that takes the old games and makes them look new.
4068168	4069128	That's what you're going to do.
4069949	4072570	And then they could put out new games that look even nicer if they want.
4072690	4078393	But at the same time, they don't have to do that much because they can just put out these low quality games and they upscale everything and it looks pretty.
4078573	4081754	Yeah, but I don't think, but I don't, this is not going to be Wii 2.
4082135	4084976	It's absolutely not going to just be the Wii with enhanced graphics.
4085076	4085656	Absolutely not.
4085696	4087717	I mean, there's a, there's a whole little follow up.
4087737	4088918	If it was, they should call it the Wii Wii.
4089218	4093000	There's a follow-up article to this where they actually said, they came out and said, what is this?
4093400	4098562	Saturo Wada comes out and says, quote, we would like to propose a new approach to home video game consoles.
4100683	4100923	Please.
4101323	4101543	Okay.
4101823	4103344	A new approach to home video game consoles.
4104384	4106065	So with the Wii... Is the Facebook thing.
4106625	4106846	Yes.
4107026	4110087	So with the Wii... But not actual Facebook, Nintendo book.
4111132	4116456	With the Wii, they were trying to get people that were non-gameplayers to play this console.
4116876	4126623	So were they going to try to... It's kind of hard, though, because now, were they going to try to bring... Oh my god, this would be hilarious.
4126923	4129545	Because they'd be basically eating their own words.
4130566	4134829	Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out with something that was very similar to the iOS marketplace or something like that?
4134849	4138291	Really cheap-ass games, and this whole iPad-type thing.
4138351	4138792	DSiWare?
4139437	4147259	Well, no, I understand that they have DSiWare, but, you know, I'm saying to the point where it's, you know, more than three releases a week or something like that.
4147299	4149339	You know, just something ridiculous and very casual games.
4150199	4154680	I'd laugh my ass off because, you know, oh, Apple, they're stupid, you know.
4154880	4155760	Oh, then we're going to copy them.
4157181	4157481	I don't know.
4158461	4161381	I can't really pass judgment on it yet until we actually see what it is.
4161762	4164342	But I, you know, let me put it this way.
4164422	4168023	If it's anything like the other Nintendo promises and stuff that we've seen...
4168883	4170904	A lot of it is really eye-roll worthy.
4170964	4172784	I mean, seriously, remember the Wii Zapper?
4173065	4174465	I mean, I go back to the Wii Zapper.
4175605	4178667	When they first showed it off, the prototype, it looked fucking badass.
4178727	4182208	It was like, oh yeah, dude, that's the Zapper right there.
4182488	4187190	And then when they came up with this plastic shell Zapper that looked like shit, I was like, what?
4188070	4188350	Really?
4188970	4190471	That's your controller?
4192827	4200092	And speaking of which, are we ever going to get any other controllers that plug into the bottom of the goddamn Wii Remote?
4200472	4201473	No, you're not.
4201773	4203294	Because they're on a new console now.
4203414	4205495	So the answer is no, Loki, you're not.
4206216	4206997	I can answer that for you.
4207017	4207657	All these promises.
4207677	4210359	You're welcome.
4210459	4213881	Let me ask you this, because obviously you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.
4213941	4215342	It's why people love you or hate you.
4216843	4219564	But yet you own a 3DS and you've owned multiple 3DSs.
4219604	4220765	Yeah, but I don't play it.
4220785	4221605	I don't even know why I own it.
4221645	4222645	I'm not razzing you on it.
4222825	4233009	My true question for you is, what could Nintendo do at E3 with this console to make you go, okay, Nintendo, I misjudged you.
4233329	4234330	You're on the right track again.
4235049	4236129	Get with the times!
4258072	4263419	I need something a little bit more than just Oh look, new Mario game Oh look, another Mario Kart Oh look, another Zelda game
4278337	4279899	Maybe make a new franchise.
4280019	4283903	You've been dealing with these old franchises for a long ass time.
4284264	4287327	How about creating the next good franchise?
4287487	4288068	Or maybe just...
4289548	4289928	I don't know.
4290008	4308884	Putting a little bit more effort into something because if we put out another Zelda game or if they take Twilight Princess and make it look even prettier or something like that or like that one Zelda game that they were showing off that was Twilight Princess at one point and then they ended up scrapping that kind of look for the game because it's a dark Zelda game or something.
4309985	4310285	I don't know.
4310345	4315630	I just want a little bit more than just Nintendo games and better graphics.
4315910	4317951	I don't know.
4318452	4318512	It
4320908	4323271	I want to see what they're offering.
4323451	4324512	I guess we'll have to wait and see.
4324752	4325933	But I'm sorry.
4326594	4330878	I know for a fact that I'm going to be laughing my ass off during this press conference.
4331899	4337745	It's just going to be... Because they have these really wacky ideas of what people want.
4339767	4342690	But apparently it works for them, so I'm not going to fault them for it, but...
4344637	4372158	at the same time there's consoles out there that I'm playing way more than we although to be fair my wife has gotten back to playing the Wii I did break my Wii for a little bit though and I had to fix it by swapping out the motherboard but you know and then we got back into playing some of the old Wii games that we liked like Excite Truck which Nintendo for the love of God just make another damn Excite Truck game do not make Excite Bots just another Excite Truck game with more tracks that'd make me happy
4373834	4374775	How about a new F-Zero?
4374835	4376316	That's what I asked for on last week's show.
4376356	4376736	Eh, whatever.
4378078	4378978	Play Speed Racer.
4378998	4379839	It's pretty much F-Zero.
4380600	4384543	No, but seriously, they just need to do that.
4384783	4385323	Just make...
4386587	4387708	Yeah, perfect example right there.
4387988	4388549	Excite Truck.
4388829	4394933	Launch Wii title, use some of the features of the Wii that like, you know, like, oh, SD memory card.
4395033	4395294	Guess what?
4395314	4397215	You can play your own music off the SD memory card.
4397495	4398496	That's really awesome.
4398716	4404701	It made that game so much more awesome because you can listen to your music while you're driving in this really awesome racing game.
4405061	4405801	Sequel comes out.
4406102	4406722	What do they do?
4407243	4407783	Oh, guess what?
4407883	4409184	We need more mini games in there.
4409484	4411706	Mini games do not belong in a fucking racing game.
4412026	4412626	Thanks for watching!
4438241	4441823	I get that it's wacky and stuff, but it's not fucking Excite Truck.
4442404	4444965	So that's what Nintendo needs to do to make you happy is stop making sandwiches.
4444985	4448187	They need to treat us like adults instead of just little kids.
4448227	4448428	Get it.
4448688	4450809	I mean, people, yeah, I get it.
4450869	4454051	People like the party games on the Wii because, you know, Wii is kind of a social game.
4454091	4456433	But you don't need to make every goddamn game a party game.
4457393	4460335	And you also don't need to make every damn game a family game.
4460535	4463317	What about this comment from Forbes111 in our chat, Loki?
4463457	4465018	Again, they don't care about what you want.
4465098	4465778	It's about the money.
4466098	4466598	I retorted.
4467099	4468920	If they want the money, they need to care about what we want.
4469600	4471361	Well, how well did Excite Trek sell?
4472622	4473202	Not very well.
4474423	4476404	Maybe that's why they didn't give you more of that.
4476464	4477965	Because they didn't advertise the damn game.
4479166	4481207	It was an awesome game, and it's really underrated.
4481227	4483828	I'm really sad that they... But here's the thing.
4484709	4485249	Yeah, you're right.
4485449	4488731	You don't have to do what I want, but I don't have to buy your console either.
4490279	4490859	and you know what?
4491059	4496282	As consoles get more expensive and money gets tighter, I won't be buying every console that you put out.
4497003	4500405	And yeah, the 3DS was pretty much an impulse buy and you know what?
4500485	4503666	Kind of have some buyer's remorse over it because there weren't any...
4505094	4507236	There weren't any really must-have games at launch.
4507516	4508036	And you know what?
4508076	4511259	There aren't really any must-have games in the next portion of the year.
4511419	4512800	And yeah, I know Zelda's coming out.
4513140	4517823	But as I've said before, Ocarina of Time is the most overrated fucking game on the Nintendo system ever.
4518124	4518424	Agreed.
4518844	4519765	So, you know what?
4520085	4521586	I'm not buying Ocarina of Time.
4521666	4522587	So what's that leave me with?
4524346	4526407	Fucking nothing, because there's nothing coming out.
4526507	4527087	So, great.
4527107	4527787	Kid Icarus?
4527827	4528487	Yeah, Kid Icarus.
4528608	4528988	Oh, great.
4529488	4534950	Well, then I'll enjoy my three games for the next nine months or whatever it's going to take for Kid Icarus to come out.
4535970	4536790	So, that's it.
4537030	4540012	Netflix 3D, that's what I'm looking forward to.
4540052	4543313	We'll see what they bring to the table at E3.
4543753	4546834	But just remember this, and another thing.
4547274	4549215	Here's the other thing that'll make me happy, Nintendo.
4549935	4550415	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4579772	4584796	Beyonce is being sued because, God, we love lawsuits this week.
4584836	4586197	That's all we seem to be reporting on.
4586577	4589059	Beyonce got sued for $100 million.
4589639	4590900	She probably has it.
4591580	4594162	Beyonce, even though her new single is terrible, just saying.
4594542	4598085	But Beyonce has been sued for $100 million from Gate 5.
4598505	4599646	Why is she being sued?
4599766	4608892	Well, it's because the singer made this huge demand for more money during a crucial moment in the production of a game called Star Power Beyonce.
4609532	4609893	That's right.
4609933	4612174	They were making a game called Star Power Beyonce.
4612234	4613976	I have no idea what this game would have been.
4614056	4617438	I imagine it must be like the Michael Jackson experience or something.
4617479	4617759	I don't know.
4617779	4619000	She shoots stars out of her cooch.
4619080	4624464	A music game that involves Beyonce where you could do the single ladies dance in the privacy of your own home.
4624744	4625425	Put your hands up.
4626525	4635548	Anyhow, Gate 5 says we are entitled to the $6.7 million that we invested and the $100 million in profits that we would have made.
4636008	4642550	They had to let 70 employees go right at the Christmas season because of what Beyonce did.
4642590	4643230	What a Grinch.
4645035	4657459	and they want an injunction against Beyonce from commercially associating with any other video game or using confidential information that she got when she was working with the company.
4659031	4659792	Thank you for watching!
4680874	4682875	Maybe her people did, her entourage.
4683095	4683475	I don't know.
4683495	4686236	I think Jay-Z sat with her in those meetings.
4686276	4686916	I'm sorry.
4686936	4690157	We now have a discussion going about people buying Beyonce cooch stars.
4691478	4693458	I said I would rather buy Gaga cooch stars.
4694219	4696479	I wouldn't buy... How about all cooch stars?
4696539	4698320	Just get all the crazy ladies.
4698340	4699600	A Beyonce game sounds dumb.
4700041	4700481	I'm sorry.
4700621	4700961	It just...
4701481	4702262	It would have made money.
4702782	4705764	I mean, it wouldn't be like the biggest video game ever, but it would have made money.
4705804	4706345	Let me put it this way.
4706365	4715912	$100 million, I mean, that's way more than... If they were going to spend $100 million, or they spent $100 million on this game... No, they think $100 million is what they lost.
4716412	4717753	They lost... Oh, come on!
4718554	4721576	They would have never made $100 million on this game.
4722096	4724838	That would require them selling... Let's just say it's a $50 retail game...
4727020	4729662	And let's just say that it's all pure profit.
4729762	4733545	I mean, because this is never going to, I mean, it would be way more than that.
4733565	4736928	They would have to sell more than 2 million copies of this game to make their money back.
4737308	4742192	Assuming that they were getting all of the money from the actual game sale, which they're not.
4742352	4746095	So, you know, they're saying that this game would have sold over 2 million copies.
4746235	4747896	It would have not sold over 2 million copies.
4747936	4752019	It would have sold 200,000 copies at the most.
4752600	4754461	So they would have had to fire people anyway.
4754561	4756603	So who cares?
4760664	4766468	Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news, and then we're going to get to the release dates here in a little bit.
4767048	4771731	Trying to keep the show moving right along in what was a pretty hefty news week.
4772151	4776734	And I know there's going to be lots of phone calls tonight, so I want to keep some time open in Part B. So it's my turn?
4776914	4777794	That's right, it's your turn.
4778495	4779115	Tron!
4779595	4780976	But you have to do the single ladies dance.
4781516	4781677	No.
4781937	4782177	Alright.
4783755	4784215	Tron!
4785116	4786076	Guess what about Tron?
4786917	4788077	Pinball!
4788498	4790639	Ooh, happy, happy, happy, happy.
4791079	4796522	Yeah, I showed this to Dan, and he's like, what pinball tables can we get rid of to get this?
4797382	4798223	I was actually thinking that.
4798263	4800944	I was like, which pinball tables are you going to sell to buy the Tron pinball?
4802425	4806307	Actually, three of our tables would equal the cost of this, which is the problem.
4806327	4807067	You know what?
4807267	4808108	I think you should do it.
4809449	4811970	If it were my choice, I'd get rid of Lord of the Rings, but Dan loves that table, so...
4812409	4817911	Anyway, yeah, Stern, which is like the only company doing tables anymore, is putting out Tron.
4818571	4831336	And instead of doing just their usual teaser of the cabinet art, they've actually got the whole play field out, which I'm going to go ahead and link an image in the chat room for them to look at.
4831856	4834317	But the pictures are up at arcadeheroes.com.
4834437	4836018	It's actually looking really good.
4836638	4837118	It's got...
4838859	4844141	3D models in there, the light cycles, little figures in the back, plenty of ramps, plenty of lights.
4845201	4859727	And they're actually talking about doing a potentially limited edition where they might have something other than just those monochrome LED backgrounds.
4860087	4861908	But that's still kind of speculation.
4864769	4870571	It's pretty cool, but the back glass is supposed to have the 3D parallax effect that's the same on the Avatar pinball.
4871352	4875394	So it's going to be out sometime this month with a limited edition in June.
4876374	4880836	And it looks sick, and hopefully California Extreme will have one for us to play.
4881476	4883117	Like they had Iron Man last year.
4884118	4884418	And, uh...
4885818	4890659	On top of that, one of the other tables that Stern's doing, by the way, is the Rolling Stones, but it's like a $6,000 table.
4890799	4891599	So how much is that table?
4891819	4894280	This one's going to be about $4,000, $4,500, something like that.
4894300	4894980	That's not bad.
4895020	4895420	Jeez.
4896120	4908283	Well, you know, Stern pretty much, and this is the problem I have with this, is that now that we don't have Williams and Midway doing tables anymore and Capcom's out of the game, Stern's really the only company there is.
4909683	4910604	They can charge what they want.
4910724	4917290	They have the Williams Collection coming out on the 3DS in June, I think.
4917951	4918652	That's kind of cool.
4919312	4920693	I've got the Williams Tables.
4920914	4924277	Yeah, that game has been re-released so many damn times by Crave.
4925958	4928521	I thought Crave closed down, but they're still making games.
4930162	4930823	Porting games.
4932905	4933225	I don't know.
4936396	4937076	And this is my thing.
4937377	4941281	As much as I love video pinball, nothing compares to the real thing.
4942442	4949749	So I would almost always go out and hunt down a good pinball table than have... So you wouldn't be interested in a pin maim table?
4950149	4952171	I played a pin maim.
4952552	4953172	And you know what?
4953793	4956215	It was fun, but not my thing.
4957756	4984183	and I'll tell you what I did because a few years ago they had one at California Extreme and right next to it was a Black Knight 2000 and I played Black Knight 2000 on the pin maim and then I played Black Knight 2000 on the real thing and it's just you just can't get the same feel it's a very good simulacrum I mean pin maim itself is very well done but it's just not the same
4985153	5010053	I want to go ahead, I can't remember very often in the history of our show that we do this but there is a real world that goes on out there outside of us and not just what's happening in the world of video games and if you are all about 100% video games I do encourage you to go outside once in a while but needless to say there's a lot going on in the real world right now they are saying that President Obama is scheduled to address the nation any minute now I guess it's supposed to happen at 10.30 Eastern but it's running a little late
5011194	5030488	I take this with a grain of salt we'll find out in the next few minutes I'm looking at what is usually a pretty respectable source it does sound like Osama Bin Laden is dead and the US has the body and that's what Obama is expected to announce in the next few minutes that is not confirmed I'm getting that from a source that's usually pretty right on about these things
5031268	5032089	So more to develop.
5032109	5037951	So I do encourage you, if you are listening to the show, you might just want to keep CNN open in another tab and furiously hit refresh on that.
5037971	5043633	Because if that is the news, that's obviously going to have people talking about more than just games for quite some time.
5044274	5049596	And then he invites in the guy from the announcer from NBA Jam.
5049696	5051157	Boom shakalaka!
5052378	5058386	Did you, by the way, not meaning to really derail so much, but did you see the White House correspondent speech?
5058627	5058987	I did.
5059288	5060029	That was brilliant.
5060489	5060990	I love that.
5061250	5061911	I love that man.
5062272	5062652	Good time.
5063053	5064195	I'm glad I voted for him.
5065256	5066358	His sense of humor is amazing.
5067272	5086003	Alright, again, I just know where to look for information and rumors that are usually right on Hold on, hold on Let me just put a funny, maybe morbid image in your face Wouldn't it be hilarious if they just pulled a whole fucking Weekend at Bernie's Oh, stop it
5086743	5089304	Here's Hassan Bin Laden waving his hand.
5090204	5091065	All right, moving on.
5091705	5092165	Moving on.
5092265	5092685	And thank you.
5092885	5099247	Bobby actually gave me the original tip on that, so thank you, Bobby, who told me to go look at CNN, and that made me think to go check my tweet.
5099267	5108130	Yeah, it's, again, not official, but my guy on Twitter who tends to be on top of this stuff is rolling out all these sources that seem to point to that being the case.
5108590	5110731	Well, that would be interesting.
5110771	5113433	That would be extremely interesting, to say the least.
5113693	5120897	Anyway, the show must go on as they say, but I do know we live in a multitask world, so those of you listening live may wish to alt-tab to CNN.
5121377	5124179	But please don't turn us off.
5125000	5128702	If they confirm it or whatever it is, I will relay it for you guys.
5129002	5130683	How about I keep the website up and I'll keep an eye on it?
5130743	5130983	All right.
5131303	5132384	Okay.
5132424	5137807	Moving on, let's talk about release dates and what is coming soon to a gaming store near you.
5138007	5147034	Yes, these games may not be able to be played by Osama Bin Laden very soon, but coming next week, Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska for the Nintendo Wii.
5147474	5152898	If you like your hunting, and you like your Alaska hunting, and you like your Sarah Palin, but she's not in the game.
5153939	5156621	Can't hunt her either, so I don't know.
5156641	5159163	It's budget price, so I guess that might be good.
5160584	5164107	Thor, God of Thunder, or God of Movie Titan Game.
5164227	5166629	That is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and
5168050	5171973	Wii, DS, and that's it.
5172413	5173434	No 3DS, unfortunately.
5173454	5174074	That got delayed.
5174915	5177476	You'd think it'd be easy to port over.
5177737	5189604	Also, the game that I've been highly raving about, and I, sadly enough, haven't been playing much of it lately, just for no reason whatsoever, but Motorstorm Apocalypse, coming out on PlayStation 3.
5189905	5196809	If you like racing games and you like crazy destruction and just all sorts of insane stuff going on while you're racing,
5198211	5199253	Seriously, go pick this game up.
5199313	5200656	It's just amazing.
5201398	5202821	That's coming on PlayStation 3 this week.
5206870	5207691	Sadly, that is it.
5208849	5209489	That is all.
5210370	5214091	Good stuff for the rest of May, though, but just unfortunately next week is a little light.
5214111	5217232	What are some other highlights in May, just so I know what I should be looking at?
5217332	5223774	Well, in two weeks, we have Brink, which is going to be an awesome first-person shooter from Bethesda.
5223794	5224494	That's coming out.
5225854	5227755	Lego Pirates, if you're into that kind of thing.
5228695	5230756	MX vs. HV Alive, if you like that.
5231256	5233497	And then two weeks, the game I'm looking forward to, L.A.
5233817	5235778	Noire from Rockstar Games coming out.
5235818	5237278	Yes, there's quite a few people looking forward to that.
5237618	5238779	So that's going to be awesome.
5239019	5249747	And then, of course, towards the end of the month, if you're a big fan of racing, Dirt 3 coming out and Hunt of the Demon's Forge if you're into those types of games.
5250587	5256571	Unfortunately, actually a lot of stuff that was supposed to be coming out in the month, Fear 3, Dungeon Siege 3, and Red Faction all got delayed to June.
5256651	5260154	But Red Faction looks pretty good too, although it's kind of got a Dead Space vibe.
5261114	5261515	I don't know.
5262755	5264477	Not really feeling Dead Space, so...
5265057	5265378	but L.A.
5265438	5269185	Noire looks awesome so that's probably the next game I'll pick up and maybe Brink.
5269305	5270207	Brink looks pretty cool too.
5271343	5273203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5296283	5323535	there is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week that's it that's the releases May 12th, Steel Diver on the 3DS which we've had here obviously since release Major League Baseball on the 12th but as far as the 5th which the games are usually out on Fridays nothing wow it could be that all that's going on in the world as far as Japan is maybe shuffled some things up I mean it's, don't know
5323837	5324237	Possibly.
5324697	5326318	Well, we have a few releases for the UK.
5327058	5329799	On the 4th is Bangaio HD Missile Fury for Xbox 360.
5330840	5332000	Bangaio is so much fun.
5332540	5334501	And there's Section 8 Prejudice for PC.
5335121	5341443	And on the 6th is Sniper Ghost Warriors, Steel Diver, and Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011.
5341623	5343184	Eww.
5345205	5346065	That's what I say about that.
5348715	5350556	Alright, well, so much for release dates.
5350596	5352616	It's looking a little dry no matter what part of the world you're in.
5353096	5353977	So let's go to Loki.
5354497	5361839	Alright, well, there's some interest... Oh my god, the chat room is yelling at me because I said the release dates are looking pretty dry in Japan.
5361859	5363760	You guys are dummies.
5363840	5364140	Alright.
5364680	5366282	I mean that with love, but seriously.
5366602	5367122	Alright, Loki.
5368204	5372628	Sony revealed two new tablet devices that are going to be part of the PlayStation suite.
5375550	5380395	One of them, I guess they're officially the S1 and S2 tablets, which...
5381576	5383677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5404568	5409751	It's a dual screen tablet and people are saying it looks like the DS.
5409771	5413893	I guess you can run two different things at the same time.
5413933	5421178	You can watch a video and chat at the same time on the other screen or use the other screen as a soft keyboard and whatever.
5421778	5428962	But they're two 5.5 inch screens and both of course will be able to play select PlayStation 1 games.
5429162	5429963	Tangible buttons?
5430323	5431324	Nope, couldn't care less.
5431804	5432365	Exactly.
5433386	5436830	So yeah, I'm not interested unless they were to have tangible buttons.
5437831	5441535	Can you imagine playing a PlayStation 1 game on your iPhone?
5441555	5443036	Because that's what this is, basically.
5445139	5445839	I mean, seriously.
5447542	5447802	All right.
5448903	5451825	Anyhow, let's move on to another story.
5451865	5456409	This is also kind of a follow-up because last week in the middle of the show, some details were breaking on it.
5456449	5457910	Well, I guess it was really that day.
5458190	5460252	Phantasy Star Online 2 details.
5460953	5463335	We're getting some more information on what that was all about.
5463855	5469480	So there was a PSP2 promotion event that was in Akihabara over last week.
5470140	5470240	And...
5471461	5475743	Let's see, there was more information released on Phantasy Star Online 2.
5477264	5479664	Apparently now you're going to be able to jump in the game.
5480225	5487408	Also, randomly generated hunting areas, some third-person shooter-style gameplay, and so on.
5487528	5489128	So they're adding jumping into it.
5489168	5491569	That could certainly make the levels different.
5491969	5493230	Randomly generated hunting areas.
5493270	5495271	See, I seem to remember the levels in the old...
5495991	5498312	I was just said National Journal learned it's true
5525316	5530439	It says, yeah, according to MSNBC, their same president will make a statement soon regarding Osama bin Laden.
5530680	5534562	Fox News saying it, New York Times is saying it, so it looks like, there you go.
5535383	5535643	All right.
5535903	5536263	Sweet.
5536924	5540866	Back to, again, keep CNN open in another tab.
5541407	5542768	There you go, if you're listening to the show.
5543108	5547131	Or whatever, I say CNN, but whatever your website of choice is, okay, kids?
5547651	5549552	DarkSakura, tell us about what is the classic game of the week.
5573564	5577666	The game of the week is Afterburner, which came out in 1987.
5577766	5581348	It's a flight sim arcade game put out by Sega.
5581948	5586511	It had full motion seats, at least for the deluxe cabinet.
5586951	5589532	It was also designed by Yu Suzuki, who is the man!
5590813	5600058	Anyway, you control an F-14 Tomcat, and you go through 18 stages, and you take off from an aircraft character called the Sega Enterprise.
5600958	5626632	Which is an homage to Top Gun and not Star Trek And so it had basically an integrated flight stick That would control the way the cabinet moved either back and forth And it had hydraulics in it And it would have cannon and missile buttons It was also a standing upright one But the rotating cockpit one was the awesome one
5627632	5633198	So, um, it was, I mean, basically it's just straightforward.
5633338	5641266	You shoot down planes and you have like a lock for your missiles and you can shoot them down and you choose, you know, your direction.
5641346	5644809	There's also After Burner 2, which was a sequel that was put out the same year.
5645890	5674135	and then there were other games that focused on the F-14 Tomcat like G-Lock Air Battle and Strike Fighter that was actually rebranded as After Burner 3 and then Sky Target there was also Sega Strike Fighter which was a free roaming type of F-14 game and then we got After Burner Climax which is the one that I played just this week that's really sweet there's also a PSP release called After Burner Black Falcon
5675478	5679875	and actually some of the music in this was remixed for Bayonetta.
5681388	5681968	It was pretty cool.
5682669	5695254	As far as other versions that have been out, there was Amiga, the Amstrad, the Atari ST, Sharp X68000, FM Towns, Commodore 64, NES, Sega Master System, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, PC, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.
5695895	5702158	And then there was a 32X version that was called Afterburner Complete in Japan and Europe.
5702378	5704059	But I'll tell you what's cool about that.
5704099	5706760	It also is the same for Space Harrier on 32X.
5707380	5708941	It's the arcade version, the full arcade version.
5709341	5711745	You can actually do a little trick to make it say insert coin.
5713027	5715130	You know, so it's kind of neat.
5715190	5716432	It's pretty much the same ROM.
5717153	5725105	And the little article here has a few other bits and pieces, like in Terminator 2 Judgment Day, John Connor's playing Afterburner.
5727722	5728363	Oh, that's right.
5728383	5729064	I forgot about that.
5729104	5729585	Yeah, he is.
5730246	5734831	And in Red Dwarf, seasons two and three, there was an afterburner in the bar area.
5736834	5738436	And pretty cool.
5739217	5739497	Yeah.
5740499	5741580	I love the music in this game.
5741680	5744403	I'm really surprised you've never done afterburner before.
5745498	5748500	Well, and After Burner, I have to say, is not one of my favorite games.
5749541	5751122	But I love After Burner Climax.
5751182	5752083	I love the cabinet.
5752523	5753404	I love the cabinet.
5753524	5760249	After Burner Climax actually has the full-on hydraulic seats that has front, back, side, up, down motion.
5760429	5762571	So it's super, super fun.
5762911	5767254	And the other thing that was really great about these is that they did include a motion stop.
5767354	5769956	So if you couldn't take it, it would just stop the movement.
5770656	5771277	It was pretty cool.
5771717	5772718	But yeah, After Burner...
5774429	5779160	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, everybody, Afterburner.
5779941	5784972	Best known in its arcade release, but certainly ported to plenty of home consoles.
5785458	5788139	Alright, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5788159	5789180	But don't go anywhere, guys.
5789260	5791541	We're going to be right back with plenty more of the show tonight.
5792322	5795923	We've been talking a lot about PlayStation, but there's been big news on Xbox this week as well.
5795943	5797404	So we're going to talk about that as well.
5797844	5799245	Some 3DS news as well.
5799345	5800866	And Loki's going to bring us some hacking news.
5801346	5804788	All when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5811380	5813702	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5813742	5827374	We are live on this Sunday evening, May the 1st of 2011, with the 411th episode of our show, where we're giving you not just the 411 on what's going on with PSN and all that stuff, but apparently what's going on in the real world as well.
5828055	5837883	It's quite an exciting evening, but in the interest of those that are... We'll keep you abreast if anything huge develops, but in the interest of those that listen to the podcast throughout the week, by the time this will be...
5840045	5847088	There's one little announcement that's going to be closer to 11.30 Central Time that the announcement will be made.
5847108	5848569	They're still working on final statements.
5848969	5849350	Interesting.
5849830	5855953	But everything's set up, so that will be 9.30 Pacific for our live listeners.
5856333	5856593	All right.
5856913	5858354	Well, let's move on, though, with the show.
5858414	5863617	We want to get back into video games, especially out of the interest of those that listen to the show throughout the week by the time this will be long reported on.
5864077	5865299	I'm going to name my firstborn Wolf.
5865980	5866841	After Wolf Blitzer?
5867061	5869044	Yes, because Wolf was a freaking badass name.
5869384	5871867	What was the name of the dog that played piano on the Muppets?
5871887	5872428	Was that Ralph?
5872488	5872729	Ralph.
5872869	5873329	I like that.
5873449	5873970	No, Wolf.
5875172	5876373	How about, what if you have twins?
5876413	5877314	Can you have Wolf and Ralph?
5878796	5880478	I'll have Wolf and...
5882398	5883198	Wolf and Fox.
5883539	5883799	All right.
5884279	5885920	Let's move on back into the show.
5886460	5887440	First, spin-off shows.
5887820	5890322	If you like Orange Launch Radio, there's some other shows you might like as well.
5891142	5891642	I do one.
5891742	5893983	It's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
5894283	5896064	It's a show about all things World of Warcraft.
5896084	5896904	This week was a fun week.
5896924	5898165	It was our international edition.
5898465	5904668	We had this gal, Syl, from the Girls Gone Wow podcast, and she is a Dutch lady living in the U.K.
5905328	5907869	She's Southwest, I think Southwest part of the U.K.
5908189	5909430	I saw you use the underwear picture.
5910120	5911762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5925816	5926376	Arcane is awesome!
5951476	5951737	All right.
5952037	5955259	So anyhow, you want to hear more WoW geekery, check it out, HordeHouse.com.
5955580	5956540	DarkSakura, you got a show.
5956841	5964947	We call it Comic Insanity, although we haven't done one for a month now because we've just had a lot of stuff going on and the world of comics is not that much exciting.
5965007	5969110	But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.
5969930	5972092	And we should have a new one, I think, next week.
5972252	5976035	So keep your eyes open on the website.
5976095	5976556	We're pretty cool.
5976576	5979678	I do it with Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
5980895	5981884	and we're cool!
5983346	5983726	All right.
5984047	5985248	And you actually came back this week?
5985968	5987770	No, we didn't because she's in Disneyland.
5988791	5989191	Bitch.
5989792	5990212	We're going.
5990292	5992114	And I mean that babe in total control of herself.
5992134	5992654	We're going.
5992734	5992954	Yes.
5993034	5995096	And it's for her birthday.
5995316	6000841	I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about this how openly, but there's like this awesome Disneyland trip happening very soon.
6000941	6002242	Well, not very soon, but soon.
6002602	6005305	That's going to involve at least one other person not in this room.
6005805	6006906	It's going to be epic epicness.
6007827	6009348	So more to come on that later.
6009889	6010149	Anyhow.
6011570	6011830	I know, right?
6011950	6012211	One thing?
6013252	6013332	Yes.
6028775	6029015	Okay.
6029596	6029876	All right.
6030016	6032959	Of course, we wouldn't be announcing it if we didn't do it ourselves.
6033760	6036383	We'd say, yeah, those guys in the UK.
6038165	6042649	We can end the show early if you guys just want to focus on this.
6042990	6049997	No, I realize it's important news, but I'm worried about the podcasties listening throughout the week who have probably heard this a million times by now.
6050337	6050558	All right.
6053220	6060706	Redbox is now finally rolling out game rentals for all of their kiosks.
6060726	6061967	$21,000 to be exact.
6062007	6064229	Well, not exact, but I guess that's kind of an estimate.
6065470	6067051	Starting June 17th.
6068453	6070394	Those rentals will run you $2 a day.
6071175	6077200	They're going to be, I guess, including some of the top AAA games and some family games as well.
6079383	6080364	So yeah, it's pretty awesome.
6080444	6090571	So if you're looking for another place to rent games, and maybe just game flies and getting stuff to you quick enough, you can check out a Redbox machine, which are everywhere now.
6092792	6103319	Death Smiles 2X has been rated by the ESRB, and of course, we can probably expect that on the Xbox 360 Marketplace very soon.
6103339	6108443	Of course, they've been putting a lot of other cave shmup games on there, so...
6110268	6110648	E.A.
6110668	6111789	Blackbox is the one doing the game.
6139760	6166583	and they're saying that apparently it will be kind of a cross country cannonball run style game from San Francisco to New York and not only will you be racing against police and what not but you'll also be racing through dense urban traffic, icy mountain passes and narrow canyons so kind of a little bit of you versus the elements versus police and stuff so sounds pretty chaotic, might be fun and that'll be coming out this fall
6168254	6171236	Well, did you hear the one about Marshfield, Massachusetts?
6171257	6172417	And you're probably like, what?
6172618	6173458	Unless you live there.
6174179	6181605	But yeah, Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1982, they actually banned arcade games from public establishments.
6181945	6182346	That's right.
6182386	6187030	You're not allowed to have a coin-op game in an establishment in Marshfield, Massachusetts.
6187110	6188651	It's like Footloose for video games.
6189292	6189692	Kind of.
6190352	6195797	The law was actually upheld once by the state Supreme Court the next year, and it's always been in place since then.
6196638	6204764	However, they might actually be, and the reason why this is relevant now, 29 years later, is that they are looking at possibly reversing that law.
6205605	6212371	State law actually permits Keno to be allowed in bars and other buildings, so what the hell's wrong with coin-op games existing?
6212951	6239181	the town meeting is happening this next week and voters will be able to overturn the law so it'll be up to the voters so if you know anyone there you probably want to get them to vote to overturn this law although at the same time I suppose if they've gotten by for 29 years without coin-op games in town they'll probably get by another 29 there's also that part of me that says what coin-op games because you know outside of the Tron pinball news we had earlier there's not a lot of games going on
6239841	6244103	Anyhow, a game that's rumored to be coming out on the Kinect, Fruit Ninja.
6244143	6247764	It's a very popular game, of course, on the iPhone and iPad devices.
6248184	6252466	Fruit Ninja Kinect is apparently a game that's just recently been rated in Korea.
6252846	6255727	That's not usually the country we get our rating board leaks from, but...
6256427	6257007	It is what it is.
6257127	6261988	Fruit Ninja Connect has been leaked as a rated game in Korea.
6263008	6265249	Of course, they don't say what system this is for.
6265569	6271330	It's for the 360, but they don't say if it's a disc game or an Xbox Live Arcade game or how it's being delivered.
6271390	6279852	My assumption is that it's going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game just based on what the source material is, but we won't know for a little while.
6281112	6283613	Also, one other piece of the thing came to light this week.
6283693	6290676	Apparently there was a Sonic skateboarding game that went unreleased during the Xbox era.
6291457	6296219	It was discovered by a post on the Sonic Retro fan site at sonicretro.org.
6297239	6298120	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6327217	6330252	Alright, let's move on to some more rapid fire news.
6330493	6331016	DarkSakura.
6333908	6337190	Well, we do have some news for fans of Black Ops.
6337930	6346776	There is going to be a download content pack called Call of the Dead that has George Romero as himself.
6347836	6351078	Basically, it's lots of zombie fan service.
6351419	6354841	It's going to be making the dead go splat.
6356202	6358523	And it should be pretty neat.
6360237	6365741	Then we have BlazBlue shirts that are going for Japan relief.
6366842	6372106	Axis Games has everything on sale and I will put a link to that in the chat room.
6372466	6380332	But if you want to do your part, go to AxisGames.com slash 2011 slash 03 slash 16 slash Japan dash benefit dash sale.
6380632	6385215	Or you can probably find a link from the website, but I am being nice and telling you the whole thing.
6386336	6393118	and then Rock Band has some cool bean stuff coming up including some Culture Club downloads.
6393798	6396319	So let me get what's on the list for you.
6397379	6399620	It's going to be of course Xbox 360, Wii and PS3.
6399660	6414945	The individual songs are going to be Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, From Out of Nowhere by Faith No More, Working for the Weekend by Loverboy, Stashed by Fish, Tweezer by Fish and Big Bang Baby by Stone Temple Pilots.
6416166	6421734	and that last one and Working for the Weekend also have pro guitar bass expansions available.
6422235	6423838	Oh, and so does Stashed by Phish.
6424078	6424699	Phish is cool.
6425981	6427083	So, yay.
6429528	6429888	All right.
6430549	6434491	Real quick to kind of add on a little bit what you were saying about the Call of Duty expansion.
6435092	6442517	Not only does it have George Romero, he is playing this crazy uber zombie in it, but it also has Sarah Jessica Parker.
6442797	6443497	Sarah Michelle Gellar.
6443778	6444158	I'm sorry.
6444178	6447840	Yeah, that would be, that's way better than Sarah Michelle Parker.
6448981	6452363	Sarah Jessica Parker would probably, she'd be like a plastic zombie.
6452423	6453284	Yes, a plastic zombie.
6453544	6458027	No, Michael Rooker, Danny Trejo, and Robert England,
6459948	6483253	yeah all kind of almost like playing themselves you know like they've got you know Robert Englund has kind of like some catchphrases that sort of you know hint at you know Nightmare on Elm Street and he has a pitchfork and then Danny Trejo has a machete and Microworker kind of looks like a biker so looks pretty neat
6485686	6485986	All right.
6486486	6488687	Well, let's move on to some Twitter topics.
6488747	6492369	Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
6492809	6493549	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
6494590	6497751	And you guys send us your tweets and we read them live here on the show.
6498992	6506174	Let's go to the first tweet tonight from Redertainment tweets us saying, I like putting corn on my tacks.
6506355	6507095	Is this weird?
6508274	6510796	DJ Ranma S tweets us and says, Hey, what's your definition of shovelware?
6538072	6538632	Good question.
6538652	6539993	What's your definition of shovelware?
6540353	6546797	My definition of shovelware is a game that is so blatant in copying another game you just can't even tell.
6548338	6554922	It's a very, very rushed game that is put out for the sole purpose of capitalizing on what's popular.
6556323	6558464	And DarkSakura, Loki, anything you guys want to add to that?
6559625	6562567	A game with next to none production values.
6562907	6564388	I mean, it just looks like crap.
6564448	6565549	Everything's broken in it.
6565709	6567550	It's just... Think of a ditch.
6569467	6570448	It's absolutely useless.
6571289	6573030	You shun your friends for buying it.
6574311	6576193	Is there nutritional value in dirt?
6577514	6577714	No.
6578675	6580937	Neither is there any entertainment value in shovel war.
6584059	6585501	Alright, let's see.
6586001	6586742	A couple more tweets.
6586802	6587242	Excuse me.
6587322	6589144	Blue Swim is tweeting us saying, Shit!
6591010	6591471	And that's it.
6591551	6591691	No.
6592052	6592392	Shit.
6592492	6594956	Loki talked about what I was going to call OLR about.
6595056	6596378	Got to rethink my call.
6596979	6600383	Well, you could call in and just be a Loki fan and just be like, yeah, I agree with you, man.
6601365	6603087	On second thought, let's not inflate his ego anymore.
6603488	6603768	All right.
6604950	6605531	Other tweets.
6605991	6606692	Oh, this is one.
6606893	6607093	Yeah.
6607233	6607273	D.C.
6607353	6607533	Universe
6622861	6624743	The game is being developed by Secret Identity.
6625824	6628627	It's a team that was specifically assembled to make the MMO.
6629007	6631609	It's going to be a free-to-play MMO.
6632090	6632510	Get that.
6632570	6634091	Marvel Universe is going to be free.
6634532	6635873	DarkSakura, any interest in that?
6635913	6637274	A free-to-play Marvel MMO?
6637514	6638315	I'll be all over that.
6638936	6639636	Is it a freemium?
6640617	6641878	Well, I'm assuming it has to be.
6641918	6643099	If it's free-to-play, it's freemium.
6643160	6643620	Absolutely.
6643960	6644180	But
6644981	6658226	Oh, I've actually remembered reading something about this, because I follow Agent M on Twitter, and apparently, I think he said it, or somebody with Marvel said it, that Bendis has a hand in the writing, so that's pretty cool.
6658726	6661687	Doctor Doom is going to be the antagonist, at least in the launch of the game.
6661967	6664728	They're saying that you will be able to play as famous Marvel heroes.
6664848	6669430	Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Nova, and Squirrel Girl.
6669750	6671030	Squirrel Girl is awesome!
6671210	6672291	I have no idea.
6672691	6678792	I mean, if everybody's the hero, so there must be like an instance thing or maybe kind of what they do in DC Universe where it's PvP.
6678812	6680433	I would want to play as Jessica Jones.
6680813	6681573	I'm very curious.
6682653	6684994	Brian Michael Bendis is doing some writing for the game.
6685174	6685394	Yep.
6685954	6688435	The game's story missions are taken from the comic themselves.
6688855	6689356	DarkSakura,
6710314	6712015	Who is Squirrel Girl for the uninitiated?
6712035	6731844	Squirrel Girl, her mutant power is basically being an anthropomorphic squirrel and she can talk telepathically, oh, she can talk to squirrels and understand their language, but the thing is that she's actually defeated Doctor Doom and Thanos, the real thing, by the way, and all kinds of just bad guys and also kicked Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Avengers mansion and told him to shut his evil, evil pie hole.
6733024	6733625	She's super fun.
6733685	6735326	Actually, right now, she's the babysitter.
6735667	6739390	Well, I guess nanny slash babysitter for Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's baby.
6739410	6740031	The nanny.
6743014	6743934	Mr. Sheffield.
6744255	6750000	You know, I like some of the cheeseball characters, and she's cheeseball, but actually cheeseball in a fun way.
6750521	6753924	I want to have a character in Marvel Universe that's the nanny as a superhero.
6754841	6760970	There actually was a bad guy who was a nanny and orphan maker.
6761070	6762012	Or super nanny.
6762392	6764215	You've been very, very naughty.
6764315	6766338	Now you need to go to the naughty corner.
6767019	6768422	It was nanny and orphan maker.
6769488	6770229	All right, let's move on.
6770689	6771850	Yes, I know my obscure.
6772070	6774652	Another tweet from Tiger Claw.
6775372	6781417	This show started off so well, and then there's this stuff going on in the real world, and now it's just, oh, who cares anymore.
6781717	6781977	All right.
6783298	6784679	Another tweet from Tiger Claw.
6784720	6785420	It's about L.A.
6785480	6787021	Noire.
6787822	6789483	I guess there's a social club for this.
6790464	6790824	What is this?
6790904	6791925	Is this on Facebook or something?
6791945	6793486	It's Rockstar Social Club.
6793866	6795287	It's a website thing that they have.
6795368	6796889	It's tied in with all Rockstar games.
6796989	6797249	Okay.
6797489	6801930	Well, if you get through the whole thing, you get an exclusive outfit for the game.
6802010	6804131	So I guess it's an incentive to get in on that thing.
6804371	6804931	If you're into that.
6805452	6807352	If you're into the Barbie doll stuff in your video games.
6807432	6808553	No, Social Club's pretty fun.
6808593	6810853	They had a bunch of stuff with Grand Theft Auto like they did.
6811714	6816995	They have the leaderboards for multiplayer, which I paid attention to a lot for a while.
6817875	6822397	They had things like the Grand Theft... It was the Liberty City Marathon where they tracked how long...
6822857	6827481	How far you ran, how far you drove, how many bullets you spent, that kind of stuff.
6827941	6829202	So they do a bunch of different things.
6829262	6831844	And then also they do stuff with Red Dead Redemption.
6832125	6837729	They have little challenges that you do and you unlock skins and stuff like that through those challenges.
6837849	6838830	So that's kind of neat.
6840466	6845568	Yeah, the costume you're going to unlock on the social club, if you're a member, the Chicago Lightning Suit.
6845728	6848229	It's for the protagonist, Cole Phillips, in the game.
6848790	6853471	And if you're online, you get to access the Ask the Community feature in-game.
6854032	6860234	And if you're interrogating a suspect, you don't know if they're telling the truth or not, you can see how other players responded in the same situation.
6860614	6862735	They're calling it a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
6862855	6863976	Ask the Audience Lifeline.
6864796	6865757	That's kind of crazy.
6865957	6868058	I like that kind of idea for games, though.
6868358	6881527	Well, they had a thing come out about that game as well, where if you were having trouble in certain spots and whatnot, you could actually bypass some of the action sequences in the game.
6882027	6889132	So if you keep failing over and over and over again, you can just skip past it and get back to the narrative stuff, which is kind of unique.
6891816	6892177	All right.
6893098	6896121	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
6896141	6897442	That was it for Twitter topics tonight.
6897482	6900145	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to talk to us throughout the week.
6900546	6901326	Back to some other news.
6901387	6901667	Loki.
6902127	6910076	Gamasutra ran kind of an editorial about the whole PlayStation debacle, I guess, right now.
6910536	6922468	Basically, they were saying the PlayStation brand faces an uncertain future, and they're worried that Sony's kind of, as we kind of put it before, not handling the situation correctly.
6922488	6924950	For example, here's a little test for you.
6925271	6930436	Which of the following statements are you most likely to agree with in one year's term?
6931096	6933260	A. Sony handled the situation amazingly.
6933340	6936184	They held up their hands and took an appropriate share of the blame.
6936464	6945698	They outlined a clear plan of action to remedy the situation and made sure that all stakeholders were recompensed beyond reasonable expectations.
6946358	6952661	and they showed their human side and came out of this as a stronger company.
6952982	6955343	Or B, it just kind of went away, didn't it?
6955763	6966068	Sony entirely laid the blame on hackers, launched a lot of legal flack, refused to take any responsibility, offered minimum clarity and token recompense.
6966989	6968770	But no one cares anymore.
6968970	6971651	At least they've encrypted my personal data now.
6972372	6974113	And of course, most people probably agree with B.
6975033	6979715	And even like, you know, they're saying like, you know, their response has been pretty pitiful.
6979995	6985058	You know, the best they did was send out an email and posted a post on their blog.
6985158	6993542	I mean, if you even read it, they said, we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this outage has caused.
6994402	6997003	They're saying this outage is like inclement water.
6997183	6999683	And they also said, we made a mistake here.
6999843	7000704	We picked a fight.
7000824	7001644	We couldn't win.
7001844	7004384	Or no, they're saying they should have said, we made a mistake here.
7004404	7004865	We picked a fight.
7004885	7005425	We couldn't win.
7005805	7010446	And even with attack, highly likely, we neglected the protector stuff.
7012086	7015087	So, you know, what they're saying is they could handle this, you know,
7016545	7023110	in a way that could kind of get people to trust them again, you know, just kind of showing their human side.
7023190	7031036	But without it, you know, and kind of like what we were going back to before with, you know, talking about Jack in the Box and, you know, that stuff they mentioned.
7031417	7041805	JetBlue, for example, had, you know, kind of a debacle and they ended up coming out of a better company because they spent time, effort to, you know,
7043931	7049034	Improved their customer service and in turn they became a strong company.
7049134	7051236	Also Domino's Pizza, Toyota.
7051816	7056559	Those are some of the brands that were kind of hard by a situation like this.
7056699	7064925	But then they kind of turned it around with their dedication to kind of changing their ways.
7065385	7068307	Sony so far have said, here's some DLC.
7068387	7069127	Oh yeah, we're going to...
7070548	7072629	We're on Protector Data now.
7073449	7074389	I think they're kind of right.
7074549	7074989	I don't know.
7076550	7083212	I think the PlayStation brand, as far as trusting them with my information, maybe that's harmed a bit.
7083832	7089934	They're kind of stretching the PlayStation brand a little thin, if you ask me.
7089954	7092034	Especially with tablet devices and stuff now.
7092835	7097456	Just because it plays PlayStation 1 games, I don't really know if you should call it a PlayStation device.
7099020	7110264	Yeah, and you know, I hate to kind of beat a dead horse, because we were talking about this in Part A anyway, and it's kind of like, I really think Sony can recover from this, despite what all the rampant, angry gamer chat on the internet would make you think.
7111124	7116546	But, you know, it's like Microsoft recovered from the Red Ring of Death thing, and let's be real, that was a pretty serious thing that happened.
7117147	7120568	And, you know, Nintendo recovered from, well, the Virtual Boy.
7121132	7126275	So, you know, companies can recover, and they will, but they have to do the right thing.
7126295	7126955	Yeah, exactly.
7127396	7128937	Being hard-headed is not the right thing.
7128977	7136921	Now, granted, Microsoft, I think they never really came up... Obviously, they didn't come up front and say how many of their systems were affected by the Red Ring problem.
7137762	7138242	Here's a hint.
7138482	7140263	It was all of them at launch.
7140483	7141724	Every single one.
7142044	7144426	Every single one will die eventually.
7145046	7145626	I know this.
7145967	7146807	It will happen.
7147628	7148368	Every single one.
7148828	7149469	You'll be lucky.
7149709	7149949	I would...
7152265	7152625	I don't know.
7152765	7157746	I would be very impressed to see a system that actually... One of their launch systems that's still working today.
7158247	7159507	That's being regularly played.
7159747	7162428	I guarantee that there's less than 1%.
7163128	7164288	But anyways, let's be honest.
7164348	7167729	They've fixed it after multiple iterations and tweaks and stuff like that.
7167849	7169249	Now their system is stable.
7169670	7172030	It's not dying.
7173090	7175551	They improved their warranties and stuff.
7175851	7176751	Three years and stuff.
7176771	7178232	And they covered replacements for a lot of it.
7178672	7178872	So...
7179292	7182034	Yeah, it sucked having to replace the system a bunch of times.
7182254	7183655	Oh, Apple and the iPhone 4.
7183695	7185497	That's another big one, too, with the antenna gate.
7185637	7186057	Remember that?
7186297	7186578	Oh, yeah.
7186678	7187959	And they've recovered fine.
7188059	7189760	iPads 2s are selling like crazy.
7191041	7193223	But it's all about how you handle it.
7195171	7200535	I mean, really, I'm sorry, not everyone reads the PlayStation blog, okay?
7200775	7216526	If you're looking at your average mom and pop users, say they have, you know, signed up on the PlayStation Network and they buy stuff through there, they're not reading the internet blogs, you know, and stuff, and yeah, okay, they get an email, but let's just say, for example, that, you know, they used an email with that service that,
7217227	7218989	Maybe they don't use that quite regularly.
7219049	7232224	So they would have absolutely no idea this is going on until they hear from a media outlet saying, Oh yeah, Sony's just been hacked and all these people's credit card information has been leaked out.
7233585	7235647	Ah, that's not good.
7235867	7238849	I mean, you need to be telling your customers up front.
7239910	7242351	Or at least, you know, being a little bit more clear about it.
7242391	7243892	Put out a statement or something.
7243912	7250117	I know that they did the press conference thing, but I'm sorry, though.
7250417	7251578	You're just pointing blame.
7252398	7253939	But we'll see.
7254740	7255420	It'll be interesting.
7255440	7257682	E3, I'm sure they're going to mention something.
7258082	7260844	I mean, obviously, it's still going to be fresh in everybody's mind.
7262836	7266840	All right, well, obviously it's not just Sony with news in the world right now.
7267040	7269002	Xbox, they had a pretty big thing come out this week.
7269062	7271404	Hulu Plus actually just came out to the system.
7271704	7275928	It was released on April 29th, and yeah, it was kind of fast.
7275948	7279271	The news came out during the week, and then suddenly, whew, bam, there's Hulu Plus.
7279712	7284136	Now, there is actually this whole sponsorship going on, and I apologize.
7284156	7286818	I forgot the company that was sponsoring it, but it doesn't matter.
7286838	7287519	They're not paying us.
7287899	7316736	so some company is actually sponsoring a two week preview of Hulu Plus right now and then I guess you can also get another one if you actually sign up through Hulu's website and you get a two week trial there as well so if you want to try out Hulu Plus for like a month you can do so I have not signed up for it and probably I'm not going to I think Hulu Plus is kind of a shitty idea because I'm not a fan of the fact that there's still commercials and you're paying for it like honestly I've got Netflix it's got the shows I want to see otherwise if they don't have it I'll just torn it
7317396	7326291	I'm not to come out and admit that I'm a bloody thief or whatever, but I'd use Hulu if it was money or commercials, but not both.
7326932	7328134	That's just ridiculous to me.
7329901	7330441	Thanks for watching!
7351596	7352377	How?
7352437	7353037	Diversity.
7353357	7355139	You have to... Oh, right.
7355159	7356060	You can do diversity.
7356100	7360763	You can watch your cues through pretty much any device that will do streaming.
7361604	7363706	I use my PlayStation 3 for that.
7363826	7365027	It actually works pretty well for that.
7365727	7369470	Hulu doesn't look that great, though, because it's kind of low resolution.
7369570	7374974	But we've watched a few episodes of The Office that we were missing when we were catching up all the seasons and stuff.
7375054	7375195	But...
7377614	7378014	DarkSakura
7399451	7402973	Well, in other news, we do have something for the 3DS.
7403134	7409058	Excitebike 3D Classic is going to be offered on the 3DS for free.
7409578	7413941	When the 3DS eShop goes live, this is going to be a part of it.
7414962	7422047	And like I said, it's 3D Excitebike, so you get it in full lenticular motion.
7422067	7427871	But they didn't say where it was going to be for, but it could possibly just be Japan.
7428462	7430383	Here's what's kind of retarded.
7430863	7433605	I don't know if anyone's actually seen a Japanese 3DS.
7434185	7439648	I mean, I have, but in the beginning of their... You know how we got this OK Go video?
7439688	7446172	Well, they got this Mario live music performance thing over there as the free 3D video.
7446552	7450954	And before that actually starts, they have a 3D picture of Super Mario Bros.
7451235	7450954	1.
7452175	7453676	And the way...
7454236	7455137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7476360	7477681	It was a neat effect to see.
7478041	7481782	I mean, it's cool, but I would not spend very much money.
7481983	7489446	I mean, the game is going to have to be a true NES classic that I need to have on my DS.
7489526	7490886	That's the only way I'm going to buy it again.
7490906	7491667	But see, that's what they're doing.
7491687	7493127	I got burned on the way.
7493348	7494228	They have an emulator now.
7494588	7499929	Obviously that works with, you know, these, I mean, come on, anything can run an NES emulator nowadays.
7501190	7506791	So they have an NES emulator that just spreads out the, you know, sprite layers.
7506811	7511732	You know, I mean, shit, when Homebrew comes out, I'm sure someone will come up with that.
7511812	7513813	It's not that complicated.
7513833	7514613	But you know what they're going to do?
7514633	7523435	They're going to charge you like four bucks for each one of those games because people will buy them even though it's really not worth the effort that they put in to develop this emulator.
7524895	7531099	It would be really nice if they would just give us a kickback because we bought it on Wii Virtual Console.
7531319	7533000	I mean, I know that's not going to happen.
7533020	7534101	I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice?
7534381	7541085	It would be nice, but they don't really... I mean, they have accounts that are tied to the Wii, but it's not an account that you can take everywhere.
7541225	7543666	It's basically just an account that's tied to that console.
7544307	7547128	You know, if they had an actual centralized online...
7548089	7548589	and DarkSakura.
7573369	7578413	I mean, all you'd have to do is just tweak the display so that each sprite layer is a different layer of 3D.
7578453	7580795	I mean, that's not hard.
7581516	7583578	It's not difficult, and it's very minimal.
7584278	7586600	So, yeah, that should be free.
7588662	7589182	But it won't be.
7589622	7591424	I mean, after all, how else are these things going to print money?
7592102	7592963	Even just a discount.
7593063	7594303	Even just like a little discount.
7595364	7598546	Or maybe like if I get enough Nintendo achievements.
7598746	7599267	I know, right?
7599947	7603849	I could like get one for free.
7603869	7605430	Charge them 99 cents.
7605491	7606651	That's all they really should be charging.
7606671	7607972	Yeah, charge me 99 cents.
7609433	7609853	That'd be great.
7609913	7611815	And if I don't own the game at all, then fine.
7611855	7612555	Charge me $5.99.
7613516	7616257	Five what the game would have cost and the extra 99 cents for the 3D.
7616437	7617278	No, it should not even be.
7617838	7619099	$6 for an old NES game.
7619139	7619559	I'm sorry.
7619599	7619760	No.
7620300	7620400	No.
7622021	7623821	Some are worth it, but very few.
7624341	7625062	Some are worth it.
7628162	7633583	But at the same time, I mean, I can go buy the original on cartridge, but sometimes the original cartridges will cost you more than five bucks.
7633923	7635323	Just depends on what game you're talking about.
7635563	7636224	Seriously.
7636444	7638524	Especially if you're trying to fill up your Tengen collection.
7638784	7639064	Yeah.
7639284	7640904	Which, by the way, Afterburner is mentioned.
7641484	7644025	And I have your Fantasy Zone.
7645025	7645745	If you didn't know that.
7646045	7646465	Yes, I do.
7647065	7647565	Okay.
7647585	7648586	Yeah, didn't I lend it to you?
7648666	7649146	Yeah, you did.
7649566	7650526	So, just so you know.
7650982	7659550	I was mentioning Afterburner, they did a Tengen one for Ness.
7659710	7660491	Just thought I'd mention that.
7661116	7662897	Comment in our chatroom from Toagak.
7663017	7665877	I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo ripped off a homebrew emulator.
7666778	7667098	Loki?
7669638	7672879	I don't think that they need to because they've got an emulator for the Wii.
7673019	7674320	They've got all the tech docs they need.
7674340	7675620	They've got an emulator for a Wii.
7675740	7678801	They had cartridges on the Game Boy Advance.
7679221	7680962	Or even, I think, the Game Boy Color.
7681022	7683462	They had NES cartridges.
7685943	7689205	So they've gotten... I mean, hell, they have an emulator that runs on the Game Boy.
7689325	7691506	It's obviously going to run on the 3DS.
7692007	7693928	So they have that kind of data there.
7694088	7696890	It's just minimal tweaking to get it to be in 3D.
7697750	7701572	Seriously, it's not any special effects that they're adding or anything.
7701993	7709077	I mean, if it was like some Mode 7 games or something like that, that might be a little bit cooler if those were in 3D because they had a lot of scaling there, but...
7709937	7717881	Um, you know, just, just doing like, you know, separating the sprite layers is, I'm sorry, it's like child's play stuff.
7718242	7723524	It's just really, I mean, people are gonna find it neat, but once again, they're selling you on the gimmick.
7723905	7729428	They're selling you on your memories of these retro games because they're like, oh my god, Nintendo gets, oh, it's in 3D now!
7731789	7739854	Seriously, you're going to buy into that and you're just only encouraging them to spend what little effort they will on this stuff.
7740655	7741375	But hey, you know what?
7741415	7742776	If that's what you want, then fine.
7743497	7745498	Because they're not going to change their ways anytime soon.
7746819	7747619	So, whatever.
7748280	7748920	Buy what you want.
7750601	7751202	It's my money.
7751242	7752202	I'll spend it how I want.
7752502	7753123	Yeah, pretty much.
7754984	7757405	How much did you pay to import the Japanese 3DS again?
7757966	7758326	I forgot.
7758986	7759467	Could you remind me?
7761380	7765285	DarkSakura's role is to be the girl, your role is to be the tech master, and mine is to give the both of you shit.
7765546	7765966	I'm not just a girl.
7778953	7782495	Well, I was going to say a bitch, but I thought that would be me.
7782896	7792422	I would almost consider selling that 3DS again just to get rid of it because I'm not playing anything on it really right now and I have a feeling it's just going to be collecting dust like my DS is.
7795336	7796177	Thanks for watching!
7813419	7815100	I will seriously think about it.
7816200	7822082	If they don't have some really awesome games at launch, then count me out.
7822202	7827444	I'll wait until some future versions come out.
7828044	7832386	I'm not going to be so impulse crazy nowadays because it really doesn't get me anything.
7832546	7835827	I got to play Ridge Racer in 3D for a little bit.
7836047	7839208	That's cool, but I don't know.
7839448	7841749	It's not that big of a deal.
7842734	7848457	And it all really matters about the cost of that console, because, man, that thing's like $300 plus $100 for the controller.
7849837	7850097	Nope.
7852538	7852918	Or maybe.
7854719	7857741	All right, let's move on with some, what, hacking news, right?
7857981	7861642	Yeah, the PlayStation Network's not the only thing that's being hacked.
7861862	7869746	Of course, you know, there's kind of been a struggle between, you know, hackers creating custom firmwares for the drives of...
7870406	7898602	and of course Microsoft in updating those they have the new firmware that's going to be coming out or the new dashboard update that's going to tweak the disks as well as enabling what they call AP 2.5 on all the games it's basically a new copy protection that they have right now on a couple of the Call of Duty games and on Assassin's Creed and actually some of the newer games of course all that stuff can be patched
7899903	7901886	And there's some interesting things coming out.
7902226	7905630	Some of this is almost similar to the PlayStation 3.
7906331	7912259	For example, there is a device coming out called the X360 Key.
7912399	7916765	It will allow you to play any game from a USB drive.
7917646	7927797	And what it's basically going to be, it's going to be a device that connects in between your Xbox 360, the SATA connection that's on there, and the DVD drive.
7928257	7932962	And it will allow it to emulate the actual DVD drive itself.
7933042	7938828	So it'll make it think that it's playing discs off the drive when it's actually playing ISOs off a USB drive.
7939549	7940450	or a hard drive.
7940650	7942853	And actually the system has Linux running on it.
7942913	7944054	It's fully upgradable.
7945976	7954305	And I guess it's going to have protection against whatever the E25 protection emulation as well built in there.
7955045	7955946	Outro Outro Outro
7972777	7984790	And then, of course, if that's not your way to go, the Commodore Forever, they announced that they're going to have a new iXtreme LT firmware for all drives, including...
7988394	7988975	No, you're not.
7989475	7991057	It's the hacking group, Commodore Forever.
7991277	7991978	Play Last Ninja?
7992158	7995521	They've been working on firmwares for the drives for a long time.
7996022	8003650	They say their LT 2.0 supports the XG D3, which is the new disk format that Microsoft's putting out to gain that extra one gig.
8004250	8010337	And also the slim, light-on 0.225 drive, which was unhackable as of right now.
8012258	8021263	So apparently that will allow you to bypass all this different protection and allow you to flash your drives and it's supposed to be untraceable as of right now.
8021303	8028688	And I know the light touch stuff has been pretty stealthy as far as live goes so that's kind of interesting.
8029148	8052829	and the last thing was another device called Xbox 360 Optical Drive Emulation and it's an emulator that will be a little bit similar to the X360 key whereas the device set will make it look like it's running actual disks when it's running stuff off of a hard drive.
8053710	8056032	So, very interesting.
8056072	8069443	A lot of this stuff can be patched out with one firmware update, but some of this, especially with the custom firmwares for the disk drives, it's back and forth with them.
8069583	8082073	Actually, the new firmware that's coming out, if you do have a flash device right now, what it's going to do is it's going to flash it back to stock, and then it's going to copy protect it, I guess, so that you can't adjust the firmware that's on your drive.
8082113	8083074	So, that's kind of interesting.
8086991	8090752	How long before we're emulating the actual Xbox 360 on our PCs?
8091273	8092353	A long time.
8093073	8096594	We're talking multi-core processors and emulating that stuff.
8097415	8099635	It's going to take a long time before we're able to do that.
8100676	8101256	A few years.
8104044	8108288	Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.
8108368	8110150	And this one has to do with the iPhone.
8111110	8118937	And apparently, this is something I actually did a double take and I was like, what is this being posted in our show role thread for?
8118997	8120898	Haven't we reported on this before?
8121399	8123200	Well, we have, but we haven't.
8123421	8129766	And what I mean is, this is yet another game that has appeared on the iTunes App Store that was copied off of a Flash game.
8130246	8156725	The game is called Achilles Defense It was available on the iTunes Store They're based in Hanoi, Vietnam PTT Solution It is a rip-off of Ironhide's Clash of the Olympians Ironhide Game Studio, excuse me, Clash of the Olympians The only difference is Ironhide's game has three characters PTT's app has one The music, the artwork, the gameplay It is all the same
8157365	8158286	Clash of the Olympians
8174302	8180285	Needless to say, it's there, it's been on the App Store How does Apple prevent this?
8180805	8192131	I mean, because they don't really screen the content of games I don't know, like, obviously this news is very sad That development company who, you know, had the game out there for free Did you see the Mario ripoff on there too?
8192231	8200175	Yeah, I mean, that was the other, I think, thing that had come out before There's Mario ripoff and there was that other game too that had come out So...
8201676	8204617	The Blocks Cometh, and then there was also some bunny game.
8205278	8206058	Bunny fighting game.
8206178	8209059	But that was less of a rip-off and more of a rights issue.
8209580	8210980	Who owned the rights to it and stuff.
8211080	8212741	But the other one was a complete rip-off.
8213325	8224029	For the record, Ironhide is pissed and they wrote Apple to complain and they want gamers to help assist them by lodging their own complaints in the game's comment space.
8224069	8226150	So they're encouraging people to downvote this thing.
8226531	8232793	Now it is the weekend, so I don't know what's going to happen, but come Monday I'm sure it's going to get crazy.
8234054	8235714	And maybe Apple will pull it down, I don't know.
8239825	8240326	All right.
8241767	8244709	Anyhow, let's move on to the mailbag.
8244929	8246950	Oh, and boy, we've got a fun one this week.
8247471	8250973	Because DarkSakura got a taco before the show started.
8251013	8253295	She was only getting that taco if we got 10 emails.
8253495	8254236	We got more than that.
8254276	8254996	We got more than that.
8255056	8256718	Now, I don't know if she's reading every single one.
8257638	8258658	I'm doubting that, right?
8258678	8259098	No, I'm not.
8259138	8268220	In fact, pretty much anything that's repeating the emails that Sony sent out for PSN and our rehashes of things we've already discussed, not reading them.
8268480	8270941	Let me give you a super tip if you want to email the show.
8271021	8273401	Remember, the show is about where every gamer has a voice.
8273821	8279842	And sometimes people want to email us to clue us into news and things that are going on, which is fine, especially because sometimes we miss those things.
8279862	8282143	They fall off the radar, like the case of the Marvel Universe thing.
8282904	8283565	earlier in the show.
8283686	8285610	And TigerClaw brought that to our attention via Twitter.
8285911	8288617	But if everybody's talking about it, like the PSN thing,
8289229	8290890	Probably going to cover it in the show.
8291531	8293652	We want to know your thoughts.
8294113	8295574	Don't just regurgitate the news.
8295654	8297035	Tell us what you think.
8297395	8303860	A better email will tell us about what you plan to do because of the Sony hack, which I imagine we're going to get to in some of these emails.
8303920	8308424	Some of them were that they were also repeat emailers I'm trying to give new people attention to.
8308684	8309505	Sure, absolutely.
8309665	8310185	Absolutely.
8310205	8316570	As it is, I'm being... If you've had a lot of emails, if your voice has been heard a lot, don't be butthurt that we do some other people tonight.
8316590	8316570	5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
8319252	8320193	I'm reading 11 of them.
8320474	8320874	Oh, shit.
8320934	8321194	All right.
8321234	8321935	Well, here we go, then.
8322196	8322496	Okay.
8323797	8325579	This one, it's taco time.
8325660	8330906	Join our valiant chef, DarkSakura, on her quest to defeat the evil Montezuma and his army of veggies.
8331326	8334810	Will our hero be able to stop a digestive disaster and create the perfect taco?
8335171	8336152	With your help, she can.
8336292	8337433	Only for Xbox 360.
8337493	8340277	Pre-order today and receive an official taco time salsa spoon.
8340877	8342939	Alright, I know this has been terribly lame, but I couldn't resist.
8343059	8345800	I hope you at least get a chuckle out of this.
8346021	8348322	I've been a long-time listener, but this isn't my first time writing in.
8348702	8352605	You guys help me survive my boring job, so keep up the gaming news and crazy tangents.
8352985	8354306	Feed Jamie tacos now!
8354406	8355487	That's from Panaxium.
8355627	8356568	Fine, we fed her.
8356808	8357928	And he sent me a picture.
8357948	8358409	Be quiet.
8359602	8360263	TacoTime.
8360683	8361364	Oh, this is great.
8361384	8362164	That's awesome.
8363045	8367069	They actually put your picture in the little chef's hat on TacoTime.
8367609	8369671	This is actually pretty decent Photoshopping.
8369691	8370112	I'm saving it.
8370152	8372434	Upload that to the Orange Lawns Radio website thingy.
8373174	8376417	We have the super secret email now, so we stopped getting the Godse pictures.
8376477	8378059	I'll let you do that, Rob.
8378359	8378840	All right, fine.
8378860	8379260	I'll look it up.
8380934	8381555	I'll take care of it.
8381575	8383056	Forward it to me so I do it.
8385338	8385558	Okay.
8386118	8386779	I'll take care of it later.
8386799	8387019	Don't worry.
8387239	8387840	I downloaded it.
8387960	8388180	Okay.
8388760	8389221	This one.
8389641	8391943	Dear OLR, it's been a while since I last emailed you guys.
8392023	8393104	I also miss listening live.
8393144	8394925	I really need to get back into the habit of doing that.
8395045	8395786	Yes, you do.
8397583	8406247	Anyways, I just got through with changing pretty much all of my passwords on multiple sites, as well as notifying my bank of the PSN intrusion, compromising my account.
8406787	8408908	Honestly, this has been a huge wake-up call for me.
8409088	8412949	Never before have I been this concerned about my personal information on the internet.
8413330	8420773	Sony's failure to protect my privacy and resolve this issue as quickly as possible really has me thinking twice about my future purchases on the PSN.
8421673	8426177	I have heard of PSN cards like you buy in the stores, sort of like the Xbox Live or iTunes cards.
8426577	8428038	That seems like a safer route to go.
8429359	8433243	On a lighter note, have any of you checked out Sonic Colors for the Wii?
8433643	8437786	Before Sonic Generations comes out, I highly recommend that you don't miss out on this game.
8437946	8440769	Actually, that's the one I was wanting to get, but we loaned out our Wii.
8441549	8442390	It's really a lot of fun.
8442450	8443431	Great soundtrack as well.
8443491	8447574	Sega focused a lot more on the game design and gameplay rather than story this time around.
8447995	8448855	But I have no issue...
8449776	8454000	There are other than rolling my eyes at some of the cheesy lines in the cutscenes.
8454321	8455061	Well, that's all for now.
8455121	8456162	Thanks for reading, Osfer.
8456302	8456723	P.S.
8456823	8460046	How about that Xbox 360 OLR autographed faceplate?
8460106	8460867	Oh, fuck.
8460947	8464130	You know, I just actually found a bunch of faceplates.
8464370	8465852	So, okay.
8466673	8472138	I'm going to email you back with my real email so that you can email me and we'll work on it, okay?
8474599	8475780	Hello there, Orange Lens Radio.
8475840	8484383	I feel compelled to take the time out of my busy night to write you this email as the three of you on occasion entertain the masses.
8485023	8495086	I found your show while being very bored at work on Stitcher today because at 1330 hours I was actually going through the mini podcast and I found yours to be the most enjoyable.
8495466	8497987	To be honest, I never really listened to any type of podcast.
8498627	8503611	I was bored of my music mixes on my Blackberry and wanted to hear people talk about topics I enjoy.
8504051	8510395	And yes, after listening I was heavily informed about what's what in gaming and not to mention walked away with a craving of tacos.
8511036	8522684	I will be subscribing via iTunes but sadly not too many of my friends are gamers so I don't really have anyone to tell as I work executive protection and the three friends I would rather talk about weapon calibers.
8523405	8523565	Okay.
8524065	8527748	But I will be trying to tune in while you are live on Sundays from now on.
8528148	8529509	So thanks for the great podcast.
8529569	8532392	I love it and I found something new to look forward to at the end of the week.
8532472	8533012	Thank you all.
8533112	8533713	Shattered Hawk.
8533813	8534113	P.S.
8534453	8536735	DarkSakura, if you like tacos, you should try Navajo Tacos.
8536755	8541118	Your head will explode from the pure deliciousness of this dish.
8542059	8543520	Well, if I can find them.
8544161	8544581	Sounds good.
8544661	8545001	I love tacos.
8545021	8547063	Is that a chain or is that a type of taco?
8547343	8547784	I don't know.
8549105	8552668	We need either a recipe or we need a FedEx box to show up at the house.
8552728	8553829	Give us a 411.
8554749	8556071	Ah, you see what I did there?
8556611	8557112	I'm clever.
8557472	8557672	Nice.
8558613	8558913	Okay.
8561135	8565279	I was wondering regarding the PSN hack slash outage hack slash
8566039	8573528	If the possible phishing email I wrote about at the end of May had anything relation to the intrusion.
8573989	8582339	The email did seem, upon reflection, fairly legitimate with no questions or warnings that you had to click through the link which I left untouched to enter personal information.
8582820	8585203	Only the address it was sent from seemed suspect.
8585723	8597786	Secondly, I noticed the latest issue of Games Magazine, July 2011, has a feature story on the selling of harmonics and the suspension of Guitar Hero, as well as the reviewers' take on the Dead Space 2 ad controversy.
8598206	8603387	This is, of course, months-old news, but to be fair, Games is not intended as a video game news source.
8603487	8614990	It is first and foremost a magazine of crossword and logic puzzles, with articles about board games, and within the last decade or so of video games as well, with issues likely being put together months before being published.
8615370	8617591	The July issue arriving in late April.
8618092	8623315	I enjoy games for what it is, but wonder about your take on the ultra-casual gaming press.
8623395	8631019	And this comes from Robert M. I don't really pay attention to it, so I don't know.
8631299	8634941	I finally stopped getting a lot of those news release emails.
8635001	8636102	Zynga farted.
8637162	8637943	You know, that type of thing.
8639039	8639700	I kind of don't care.
8640601	8642843	I mean, if I want to play...
8662022	8668568	There was a local channel here that reported on the whole PlayStation Network breach because it was the top story on the day that it happened.
8668608	8670329	It let off the 11 o'clock news.
8670810	8676194	And they twisted it to turn into a parents need to be monitoring what their children do type of story.
8676514	8679396	Which, yes, I understand they should, but it seemed like...
8680237	8680337	Hey.
8680357	8680417	Hey.
8702170	8705998	By the way, completely random aside, but it totally ties into this email.
8706579	8711749	I did get a last-minute story submission, and it has to do with speaking of...
8713550	8714971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8739810	8743878	Yeah, so I guess they're going to merge and continue to publish worthless stories.
8745782	8746122	Okay.
8747665	8749830	So, is it my turn?
8750291	8750771	Yes, sorry.
8750792	8750932	Okay.
8751857	8760920	Hello all, okay, I know this is probably your first email, first or second email, but I'm going to tell you, if you are going to pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.
8761300	8763261	Apostrophes are for possessives, the end.
8763621	8764861	Okay, now I'll read it.
8765302	8767662	Hello all, first of all, I have to say I'm loving the show.
8767742	8772884	Second, I want to get Jamie her tacos, so I thought I should write to you guys.
8773304	8774665	My taco was delicious, thank you.
8775285	8776065	Here's my question.
8776426	8777906	I'm a hardcore MMO player.
8777966	8784210	Blizzard has its firm grasp on my wallet for six years, and I recently dabbled a bit in playing Rift alongside WoW.
8784750	8788932	The thing is, I think Rift made me want to play WoW again, and I always wondered why that was.
8789072	8789633	Any ideas?
8790173	8792834	Maybe because it made you really appreciate World of Warcraft?
8793415	8793715	Maybe?
8794695	8797017	Also, there are lots of new MMOs being released.
8797057	8802822	Terra Online, which I like to call Chicks with Gigantic Boobs MMO, The Old Republic, and The Secret World.
8802962	8803663	Do I want to play them?
8803763	8807626	Yes, I actually want to play all of them, but I know most will probably disappoint me.
8808047	8811530	In reality, I'll probably just stick with the two MMOs, but yes, here's my real question.
8811590	8814452	Finally, do you think it's possible to juggle two MMOs at the same time?
8814892	8818476	Keep up the good show, and I hope that you get your tacos, Jamie.
8818576	8819036	Love, Syl.
8819797	8821438	Hey, it was our guest from Horde House this week.
8821858	8822039	Yes.
8823659	8824019	You know what?
8824479	8826180	I feel bad now correcting.
8828060	8828840	You bitch.
8828961	8829581	No, I'm just kidding.
8829621	8830941	See, I said that was your role on the show.
8831041	8833182	But I do that to everybody, so much love.
8833442	8833662	Okay.
8833762	8841824	So, first of all, I actually want to go back and play Star Trek Online while I'm playing WoW, but I can't afford the two together right now.
8842024	8848465	That's the hardest thing, is that, you know, trying to pay for two is usually the hardest thing to play to.
8849105	8851606	I've seen a lot of people juggle a freemium and a premium.
8852186	8852727	Thanks for watching!
8866096	8869360	When I was on Star Trek Online, I played Ragnarok Online on a free server.
8870222	8873566	So I was keeping up with two MMOs, no problem.
8874147	8876290	Most of the time it was just, which one are my friends hanging out on?
8876330	8877271	Well, I'll go play this one right now.
8877311	8880516	Okay, well, my guild's all asleep because I'm in America and they're not.
8881277	8881477	So...
8882378	8882818	DarkSakura
8911332	8913614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8931011	8931772	Nice email.
8943820	8950544	Hey y'all, I was listening to OLR about the PSN network going down and the guy who was writing in thought that Anonymous did it.
8950644	8956568	I personally don't think it was them because they said they had realized it wouldn't hurt the people they were trying to stand up for, which is a point that I made.
8957648	8964973	It sounds to me like someone heard that Anonymous was doing this and decided to take advantage of having an obvious patsy and cover their own tracks.
8965393	8970536	These guys seem to focus mainly on taking down websites and I've never heard of Anonymous actually stealing stuff.
8971156	8974739	I mean, I guess it's possible, but it just doesn't sound right.
8975159	8978961	These are the same people who defended that Casey Hines kid who was bullied.
8979862	8983465	They sound like well-meaning folk, it just doesn't seem like them to me.
8983625	8988088	Also about the hacking emails, I got one from Best Buy 2 saying that their email list had been stolen.
8988588	8995213	It just seems to be going around right now, and that's from Holly D. Wow, that's another Horde House listener I recognize.
8995233	8995653	Yeah.
8997111	8998272	Yeah, I don't know.
8998992	9004416	It's going to be interesting to see, especially with so many people involved, what the effect on the hackers could be.
9004436	9008218	Because at the end of the day, the hackers are the ones to blame, right?
9009559	9013202	Although Sony should share their part in the accountability.
9014202	9016284	Yes.
9016704	9023148	Sony needs to show what they're really doing to stop the hackers, other than, well, our system's hack-proof, inviting them in the front door.
9023929	9024830	Don't talk out of your ass.
9025630	9025850	Okay.
9028917	9030783	If any, please answer in comments or email.
9031185	9032509	What the hell is this?
9034694	9036055	Oh, no, this is crap email.
9036235	9036455	Sorry.
9036495	9037096	Oh, is it spam?
9037216	9038476	Yeah.
9038797	9043860	Ooh, we have one from Anime Jam Session Podcast Crew, which would be our buddy Ranma.
9043900	9044400	Skip it.
9044680	9045581	I'm kidding.
9045621	9046041	I'm kidding.
9047022	9047822	Greetings, one and all.
9047842	9049803	DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session here.
9050084	9054907	In between downtime and edits for the site and podcasting and everything else, I have found time to send an email.
9055447	9058149	I do have something to discuss, and I will get straight to the point.
9058669	9063452	Rob, you squeed with delight over the revival of the Commodore 64, and Loki thought it was crazy.
9063972	9064972	I do have your back on this.
9065132	9072294	I didn't grow up with a C64, but instead a Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 MC-10 and Color Computer 3 for me.
9072654	9073654	I had one of those too.
9074854	9078455	From reading the specs and design build of it, I can justify the cost, especially the Ultimate.
9079035	9089277	I can tell you right now that the parts alone would run about $300 to $350 and probably another $200 for the case itself, since it's going to be made from the original materials, not the soft, cheap plastic crap, so Loki, stop hatin'.
9090177	9090597	That's it.
9090637	9091878	Time for me to get back to work here.
9091938	9094159	The monkeys are flinging their poo at me, duck.
9094639	9095839	Take care and stay black.
9095959	9097320	Okay, now the joke is officially dead.
9097720	9104462	This email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, a podcast dedicated to anime, cons, conventions, pop culture, and everything in between.
9104502	9106723	Guaranteed podcast derailing or your money back.
9107043	9110985	Check it out at www.animejamsession.com Also on iTunes.
9111045	9112265	Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.
9112425	9115266	Could you read that part again that says to Loki, stop hating?
9115667	9116247	Stop hatin'!
9117647	9119268	That's why he's on the show is to hate.
9120746	9121828	He's our resident hater.
9123110	9124192	And he's playing Portal right now.
9124953	9126716	Yeah, well, Portal sucks.
9127037	9127798	Oh, wait, no, it doesn't.
9127939	9128640	I got nothing.
9129761	9132643	Hey, OLR crew, long-time podcast listener, first-time writer.
9133103	9137827	There have been many times that I have almost written in to comment on this, but never really felt compelled to until now.
9138247	9139628	My reason for writing is twofold.
9140088	9141949	One, most importantly, free tacos for DarkSakura.
9142149	9142710	I love you.
9143510	9145572	Hopefully this email will get to that magic number 10.
9146072	9147673	You're up there on the list.
9148234	9149835	Two, Rob, please say aloud the following.
9149935	9150395	Okay, ready?
9151256	9152917	Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery.
9153766	9156528	Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery and give half to Rob.
9157249	9162774	I'm requesting this because obviously Rob is a prophet given his prediction of the PSN outage being a bigger deal than initially reported.
9163815	9171701	I was listening to the podcast last week on the same day Sony said, Oh, and by the way, you know all that sensitive data we made you give us to play our games and use our services?
9172242	9177026	Yeah, we just put a Furby on guard to watch security and I guess the battery just ran out.
9178127	9187695	Normally, if anything was up, that little sumbitch would start talking all kinds of crazy stuff like, Meeloo, wow!
9190869	9192050	But don't worry, everyone.
9192070	9193331	We're going to put in a new battery.
9193391	9198534	In the meantime, just watch all your credit card info and change all your passwords.
9198554	9199154	We cool, dog?
9199174	9199774	Yeah, we cool.
9201335	9204177	I'm sure this topic has been beaten into the ground, so you can leave it at that.
9204437	9207319	Beards of Whiskey and Rock and Roll, Beardy McWhiskey.
9207639	9208739	I like Beardy McWhiskey.
9209260	9210140	Is he Canadian?
9210721	9212422	I don't know, but I want him to send me some whiskey.
9212482	9213462	And send me the good stuff.
9214603	9215443	And send me the beard.
9215764	9216164	Just kidding.
9217324	9219726	You would not be able to... Alan can rock the beard.
9220208	9220968	Alan can't rock the beard.
9221228	9222169	I don't think you can rock the beard.
9222189	9222829	I can't rock the beard.
9222849	9223729	He's got that baby face.
9224870	9225010	Aww.
9225530	9225670	Aww.
9226571	9229192	Then again, I didn't think Dan could rock a beard, but now he's got the goatee of doom.
9229212	9230092	You never know.
9230672	9233753	One of these days, I'm just going to shave my head, and then I'll have the beard, and we'll see what happens.
9233773	9234234	He has too lumpy.
9234834	9237435	I know, but I'm not going to have a choice soon enough.
9237875	9240676	You could totally pull a Shatner and get the fake toupee.
9241196	9241776	No, I'm not.
9241796	9242657	We'll get you a Tribble.
9243777	9243937	Inhale.
9243977	9248179	And then we can pop you on the head and go, Rob Hart's.
9249455	9250536	Next email.
9251016	9252438	Hi, OLR, it's Spazinator again.
9252458	9257642	Yes, Spazinator was one of the ones who sent me the big email from Sony, but this is the part that I'm going to read.
9258522	9259863	Hi, OLR, it's Spazinator again.
9259903	9263586	Sorry for the second email, but I have a question for you regarding the PSN press release from 4.30.
9263887	9267249	The wording in one section has me a little confused.
9267329	9268610	It states as follows.
9269051	9276497	The company also expedited an already planned move of the system to a new data center in a different location that has been under construction and development for several months.
9276877	9277778	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8, PS9, PS10
9298954	9311903	When they say that the password can only be changed on the same PS3 in which the account was activated, do they mean the PS3 in which you initially created the account, or if you, for the sake of this email, were on your fourth PS3 and had previously successfully activated your account for the current PS3?
9312264	9314805	Nope, the original one, but you'll be able to do it through email as well.
9315466	9323992	If your original one died or whatever, you replaced it with a slim, whatever you did, you're not screwed, as long as you can still log into the email account that you use for PlayStation Network.
9324528	9334814	I ask this because I have two PSN accounts, Spazinator and Movie underscore profile, and neither account were initially created on my current PS3, although I've had these profiles on my PS3 since Sony sent it to me.
9335555	9347302	With one profile, the email address is current, up-to-date, and easily accessible, but for the other, I still have the old Final Fantasy XI slash POL, I guess that's Play Online, email address associated with it.
9347802	9350504	and I haven't used that in a couple of years.
9350744	9352124	See, I'm both confused and concerned.
9352605	9354025	Could you please enlighten me on this issue?
9354065	9354686	Thank you in advance.
9354706	9356707	I think you can actually still get into your PlayOnline email.
9357607	9358288	You should be able to.
9360729	9362690	Sony SOE was not affected.
9363270	9366772	They went down for a little bit but their information was fine and that would include PlayOnline.
9368624	9370105	Okay, well, we're almost done.
9370605	9378030	Another one from Robert M. From what footage I've seen of Portal 2, how would you say it's fair to compare the ambience to that of Bioshock?
9378390	9380251	Haven't played either yet, but hope to soon.
9380911	9384974	Bioshock is a little bit more doom and gloom ominous.
9385454	9392118	Bioshock strikes me as a little more steampunk, whereas Portal's just a little more... And it's a little bit more on the psychological horror.
9393479	9394760	But Portal is the...
9395245	9397647	It's definitely like Science Lab from old to new.
9397948	9399309	I don't know how else to describe it.
9399349	9401651	With that quirky humor.
9401791	9404334	Bioshock, you know, keep in mind there's blood in Bioshock.
9404894	9406036	And there's not in Portal.
9406256	9407837	Portal is really more of a puzzle game.
9408158	9411241	Yes, you can die in Portal, but you don't die in, like, gruesome ways.
9411721	9413142	No, more like you drown or get shot.
9413343	9413523	Yeah.
9413703	9414344	Like, by lasers.
9414684	9414884	Yeah.
9415565	9417687	And if you think about it, Mario...
9419421	9423606	Only, you know, he dies from drowning in water or falling off a cliff, you know.
9424206	9427450	Characters die in games, but sometimes it's violent and sometimes it's not.
9428972	9430033	That is finally it!
9432128	9432548	That's it?
9433368	9433649	Yarp.
9434209	9435289	I read 11 emails.
9435389	9440071	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Send us more emails.
9440151	9441312	Give us things to talk about.
9441732	9445373	Sorry, no food incentive for next week, but we'll think of something in the future.
9445433	9446474	Maybe we'll have a special week.
9446734	9448894	But this time, DarkSakura's buying me something, okay?
9448914	9450055	That's all I'm saying.
9450975	9451776	I want tacos.
9451796	9452536	I want pinkberry.
9453136	9455337	Send 10 emails so I can get pinkberry.
9455357	9455897	That's what I want.
9456557	9460559	Of course, everybody knows tacos, but not everybody understands pinkberry.
9461297	9461797	Pinkberries.
9461937	9463558	Oh, wait, we got one last minute email.
9464518	9465398	And it's short, so I'll read it.
9465698	9466298	Okay, fine.
9466638	9469499	Hey guys, I just wanted to chime in so Jamie could get some tacos.
9469899	9470939	I did not get tacos.
9471059	9472660	I got taco, but it was a big taco.
9472680	9473920	That was her request, too.
9474440	9476841	I asked her what she wanted and she said she wants a fish taco.
9477061	9477261	Yes.
9479321	9480222	Fish tacos are great.
9481602	9489885	What is likely one of the main console developers would cease to exist and what is the likelihood new console developers could enter the market?
9490385	9491726	Thanks guys for a great show as always.
9491746	9493766	Hope Jamie gets tacos till her tummy explodes.
9493866	9496027	I love your rants and very logical points of view, Loki.
9496687	9499688	This message brought to you by typing on a PSP sucks!
9499868	9500789	Thanks again, guys.
9500849	9501169	Blade 3.
9503082	9507526	What is the likelihood that a main console developer would cease to exist?
9507566	9510068	And what is the likelihood that a new console developer could come in?
9510568	9513511	Now, I'm going to go back and use Sega.
9515192	9516153	We still have Sega.
9516993	9518174	Or is it Sammy Sega now?
9519415	9522798	But they did stop developing consoles.
9523459	9527562	They're still around, but we don't have them as a console developer anymore.
9529847	9531188	That's a really good question.
9532849	9534269	I don't think it's going to happen right now.
9535390	9536731	Well, yeah, no.
9537231	9539372	NEC did the TurboGrafx, right?
9539392	9540553	But NEC is still around.
9541313	9544315	Right, all these companies are still around, but they don't have consoles anymore.
9544475	9545196	Yeah.
9546276	9547897	Well, there's also, you could go minor.
9548217	9551079	You could say Philips had the CDI, Apple had the Pippin.
9551119	9551739	Magnavox.
9551779	9554641	You know, none of these really made a splash, but they did exist.
9556922	9557943	This is really hard.
9557963	9558383	Yeah.
9558942	9559842	I think quite likely.
9561163	9567326	Of the ones out now, the real newcomers would be Sony and Microsoft.
9568466	9569167	And Apple.
9569667	9572908	I still say the iBlank is a gaming device.
9573849	9576350	And that's kind of where a lot of portables are going.
9578591	9582533	You know, the thing is, though, as far as someone exiting...
9583993	9589877	Despite the news we've been talking about this week, when it comes to pure sales, none of the systems have been doing terribly.
9590358	9591478	None of them have tanked.
9592039	9597963	And that's usually why a company disappears, because they release a console that just tanks.
9598703	9599664	That really hasn't happened.
9599724	9600925	But we really have our big three.
9601986	9604708	And two of our big three are newcomers within the last...
9609584	9611346	PlayStation is about 15 years old, so yeah.
9612247	9616511	Yeah, because that came out in 94 or 95.
9619274	9628264	Sony's additions, well, contributions to the console market, they did the SNES's sound processor.
9629781	9635205	I think it's too much for a fourth person to come in, but I think if it's going to be anyone, it's going to be Apple.
9635605	9642809	I think they're going to try to sneak their stuff onto your TV through Apple TV and all this stuff more so than they already have.
9642950	9645471	And I don't think it's that Apple's really trying to get into gaming.
9645771	9646992	Apple's just in it to make money.
9649679	9676683	so we'll see but as far as one of the other three going away I don't think so one of them is going to have to release a real stinker for that to happen and I don't see any of them as particularly vulnerable right now but obviously if Nintendo is going a completely different direction with this console could be a risky move especially since 3DS didn't go up to expectations but I don't think the 3DS is doing terribly it's not doing enough where it's going to bankrupt the company yet anyway
9677042	9678863	Well, that was actually, I think, a really good email.
9678923	9680183	Thank you for contributing.
9683144	9685205	MegaboyX in our chatroom says, Screw Apple!
9685265	9686605	I think that's what a lot of people say.
9686966	9690407	But I think you just... I mean, facts are facts.
9690647	9694028	iPhone, iPads, iPods, all that shit sells really well.
9694508	9696129	And games are available on all of them.
9696529	9700711	Enough so that Nintendo has had to comment on it and kind of dog the competition.
9701191	9703351	So, they are a player.
9704372	9704472	Oh.
9705265	9706811	Alright, that's it for the email bag.
9707011	9709279	Now is the part of the show where we're going to get ranty.
9709339	9710603	It's the FUs of the week.
9710804	9710884	Rawr!
9729188	9734271	Um, my FU goes towards my last week and finals week of school.
9734711	9738233	I have a lot of work to get done and not that much time to get it done in.
9739094	9749560	And my second FU goes towards my really weird bout of exhaustion slash insomnia that's been just making me completely wiped out and kind of burned on everything going on.
9749660	9751701	So, I'll figure it out.
9751721	9753442	It's probably just end of school stress.
9754182	9754442	Okay.
9755083	9755303	Loki?
9755323	9755423	Okay.
9757286	9762209	Um, F you to the upcoming hot that's gonna be coming, uh, this week.
9762710	9780801	I mean, it's not hot as, you know, what we normally get, uh, but, you know, it's gonna get up to 85 degrees this week, and that's not that bad, but this time of year, though, you know, 85 feels like 105, you know, and then once we hit 105, we're begging for 85, but right now, it feels like 105, so, damn it.
9783803	9785004	I hate being hot.
9785124	9785845	I like being cold.
9786805	9787286	Cold's easy.
9787366	9788066	Put more layers on.
9788106	9789507	Hot, can't take more layers off.
9790488	9791449	You only take so many layers.
9793370	9794871	My FU of the week, I don't know.
9795031	9796272	Things have been pretty good, actually.
9796552	9800635	I'll just FU to me not usually getting enough sleep at night.
9800955	9802676	I should stop doing that.
9802977	9804618	Oh, FU to having to work on Saturday.
9805759	9806960	That's definitely worthy of an FU.
9807000	9808681	Yeah, we're going to get up early on Saturday.
9809721	9810202	Exactly.
9810242	9810862	Exactly.
9812323	9821771	I actually was not forced to come in, but I did it because when people ask me nicely, I tend to do nice things, even though I might not really like them.
9822872	9823872	All right, moving on.
9824553	9826695	Let's get into a couple more news stories.
9826735	9828736	And then finally, the Skype line.
9828836	9830818	I expected to be ringing off the hook tonight, but we'll see.
9831258	9834381	All right, let's get into some other news.
9834461	9834661	Loki.
9834681	9834761	Loki.
9835061	9836001	Yes, this is kind of funny.
9837802	9840143	It's one of the most annoying characters ever.
9840723	9843464	Getting kind of a return in sort of a gaming form.
9844944	9850946	Microsoft Office's Clippy is getting its own tutorial slash game.
9852367	9855307	I guess Ribbon Hero 2, Clippy's Second Chance.
9857348	9862250	It's a video game slash tutorial to kind of walk you through some of the...
9863710	9865732	New features of Microsoft Office.
9866273	9868374	It says, yes, we've turned Office into a game.
9868514	9873799	If you're going to spend time immersed in the inner workings of Office, by golly, it should be fun.
9874019	9879744	Discover new Office features by actually using them with hint button to fall back on in case you get stuck.
9880185	9883187	Race for a high score with colleagues, classmates, and friends.
9883207	9888192	You can put your high score on your resume to show off your Office skills.
9888552	9889533	I don't recommend doing that.
9890534	9893355	For those of you who have been paying attention, we've done this before.
9894016	9896758	That's how we've got the two at the end of the title.
9897138	9897979	So what's different?
9898719	9904363	Clippy, comic strips, colorful graphics, surprise animations, multiple levels, time travel, upside down.
9905204	9910947	Clippy, spaceships, Greek gods, bow and arrow battles, and tons of useful office features.
9910967	9914370	Sigh.
9915580	9917841	Will it slow down your computer insanely too?
9917881	9920922	Because that's what Clippy was always best for.
9922242	9922562	All right.
9922862	9923283	Moving on.
9923343	9924543	One more story for you guys tonight.
9924563	9927684	And it's about a big, big PC game that's set to come out soon.
9928364	9928924	Diablo 3.
9929565	9930905	And when is it coming out?
9930965	9932806	Well, some are saying possibly 2011.
9934146	9937447	I kind of hate news stories like this because it kind of seems obvious.
9937507	9939288	Well, it's either coming out this year or next.
9939328	9940008	I mean, no shit.
9940428	9942049	But here's what's causing the speculation.
9942069	9942309	No, no, no.
9942389	9942769	It should have been.
9943009	9944490	It's either coming out this year or later.
9944830	9945010	Yeah.
9945690	9947132	Here's what's causing the speculation.
9947212	9950755	The game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, said this to the New York Times.
9951116	9951436	Quote,
9957168	9985958	but I mean for Blizzard shit that could mean anything I hope it's this year I would love to be playing Diablo 3 by Christmas I'm hoping BlizzCon will shed some light on that especially since they're not going to be releasing a WoW expansion this year they may have a StarCraft 2 expansion but otherwise there's nothing for Blizzard to release this year so I sort of hope it is Diablo 3 I would say it's got to release in the well they have a new MMO they're working on yeah but that's not coming out for until like 2013 doesn't mean they can't announce it they can announce it but it won't make them money
9986398	9986898	Thanks for watching!
10007250	10011695	People paying to watch what they should be able to see at E3 on TV for free.
10013637	10016259	And I love the Blizzard products.
10016560	10019683	I just haven't loved them as much since Activision bought them.
10019723	10022426	But anyway, if you want to know more about that, go listen to the other show.
10022866	10025188	Meanwhile, let's get into the calls.
10025469	10029513	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
10029533	10030394	The phones are open.
10030834	10050915	PSN, Xbox, whatever you want to talk about in the gaming world give us a call, we'll let you talk for a minute here Kaijudo in our chatroom says I think Diablo 3 is going to be a letdown I really hope not there's a part of me that doesn't want to argue with you because you might be right, but I really hope not I hope you're wrong I think it won't be worth the development time put it that way
10051860	10053001	I mean, I don't know.
10053081	10055302	Blizzard doesn't really seem to put out bad games, though.
10055682	10057263	You know, StarCraft II is still really good.
10057643	10061405	WoW has all been great, but then again, Cataclysm did have a lot of problems.
10061545	10063626	It's been the weakest WoW expansion so far.
10064106	10075532	It hasn't lived through its life expectancy yet, but so far, it has not WoWed people, ironic, across the spectrum that the other expansions have, I would say.
10076593	10080735	SJ in chat says, I have zero hopes that it's coming out until it's in my hands!
10083012	10084094	Well, you may be waiting for a little while.
10084114	10084434	We'll see.
10084895	10086998	Anyway, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
10087038	10088100	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10088120	10088501	Who's this?
10089743	10090664	It's Deathwishing.
10090904	10092287	Hey, Deathwishing, how are you?
10093208	10094991	I'm pretty good.
10096733	10097515	I have to comment.
10098635	10098975	PSN Stuff
10128447	10130829	What are your thoughts?
10130989	10142156	I guess PlayStation Network feels that they're obligated to give free stuff on a free service to all the whiny 4chan babies.
10143597	10146919	So you don't think they should be giving anything at all?
10147019	10151622	I only think they should be giving reimbursements to the people that pay for PlayStation Plus, you know?
10151722	10155845	And the people that pay for services like DC Online and...
10156567	10178271	you know, paying customers not like, everyone gets free stuff because you all bitch but we're gonna say we're polite it's, I don't know, it kind of and then the fact that I can't play SOCOM 4 now be honest, are you, now see usually that sort of reaction comes from what you would call a Sony fanboy so be honest, are you a Sony fanboy?
10180451	10186012	I own all systems, but I really I mean, I kind of like it because I can
10186567	10188568	Get PlayStation Plus for free now just to try it out.
10188648	10192469	But I guess I kind of am a Sony fanboy.
10192729	10193009	All right.
10193029	10193429	See?
10193469	10193709	See?
10193769	10194009	All right.
10194309	10197350	Well, I mean, what did you think of all this, the hacking and all that?
10197471	10200131	I mean, as a Sony fanboy, are you like, this could happen to anyone?
10200672	10203572	Or are you like, wow, maybe Sony kind of asked for this?
10203692	10206533	I first went, wow, holy shit, I can't believe this happened.
10206633	10214476	And then after I saw, oh, we didn't have encrypted stuff, I kind of just went, Sony, you set yourself up to this, you morons.
10215387	10230680	I mean, you would think a company with all this money, with services all, you know, in this age of day that has a service where, okay, we have for the developers, we can buy all each other's games off our PlayStation Network, but we're gonna keep it on the same server, because that's the smart thing to do.
10232321	10235064	Oh no, guys, we're hacked now, and guess what, your credit card's out.
10235684	10239988	And the whole thing with the way they worked the information, that just pissed me off too, it's like the United States.
10242423	10243023	Which I love.
10246645	10254250	Do you agree with what we were saying earlier in the show about Sony is just hard-headed?
10256711	10257551	Very, very much so.
10258492	10258972	Why is it?
10259232	10266916	Is Sony just drunk with power from the rampant success of the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2?
10269278	10269558	Well...
10270143	10271284	Yeah, I think so that.
10271344	10280489	I think that what they're trying to, you know, they're too afraid of the 599 US dollar system being, like, compromised, you know?
10282050	10282270	Right.
10282391	10287974	What I'm talking about here, how it's like, oh, we have such an expensive system, oh shit, we fucked up, uh...
10289818	10294201	I think that whole not encrypting the data is going to be a real thing that comes back to bite them in the ass.
10294321	10298084	I think if this thing does go to trial, that's going to be the piece that screws them.
10298104	10299965	You saw the stock prices go down, right?
10300706	10301667	Oh, of course.
10301927	10303908	Of course their stock price is going to go down.
10303928	10305149	It already bit them.
10305570	10305990	Oh, yeah.
10306010	10309552	Especially how much of big releases for them came out that week, too.
10309573	10312835	Hence me buying actually one of those releases and not being able to play it.
10314327	10316228	Yeah.
10316488	10318129	What is going on with SOCOM right now?
10318169	10319870	Does SOCOM even have a single player?
10319911	10320471	It does, right?
10322912	10325714	Um... If you can call it that.
10327355	10328316	Interesting question.
10328436	10331077	I like this comment from Bonds006 in the chatroom.
10331598	10336561	If any one of us was working in the higher ranks of Sony, would we do something different?
10338982	10343765	I told... I mean, I was trying to get... If I was in the higher ranks, I would have ran up to the frickin'
10345074	10348157	IT people in there and punch them all in the dick.
10350299	10351119	Let me put it this way.
10351640	10359847	Yes, if I were Kaz Harai, I would have promptly fired the person in IT and I would have announced to the world that that's what we did and that's what we're going to change.
10360607	10361328	But, I don't know.
10363050	10365832	That's, yeah, that's I think what I would have done too.
10365852	10368334	I don't know if I would have punched them in the dick, but maybe with words.
10368474	10371177	Hey, they had it coming.
10371797	10372257	Yeah, I know.
10372598	10372758	But,
10373560	10379682	Xbox fanboys, your service did go down for three weeks in 2007 too, so... Three weeks?
10379942	10381963	I don't remember Xbox being down for three weeks.
10382603	10383343	Three days, maybe.
10383363	10383803	It was in 2007.
10383983	10388445	I had to do over, like, December, like, a shitload of people rushed online because they got their Xboxes.
10389411	10390351	That was like three days.
10390391	10391392	It was not three weeks.
10391712	10393172	I think it was three weeks.
10393192	10393952	No, I think you're wrong.
10393972	10397353	It was like three days, three weeks of getting the network back up fully running.
10397493	10400714	If you want to get the Xbox fanboys, you need to go to the Red Ring of Death.
10400794	10402735	But again, because that was terrible.
10402835	10406776	However, Microsoft handled it much better than Sony's handling it so far.
10407656	10408817	So, all right.
10409617	10409797	True.
10410237	10410637	Anyhow.
10410677	10411837	It's all good in the tent.
10411897	10413118	At least everything may have Prince money.
10413398	10413658	All right.
10413718	10415198	I got to let you go so we can get more calls.
10415258	10416299	And you're breaking up a little bit anyway.
10416339	10417019	So take care, buddy.
10419178	10419738	Bye!
10448820	10451443	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, KNS.
10451884	10452204	Hello?
10452385	10453186	Hi, who's this?
10455028	10455829	Hey, can you hear me?
10456029	10456410	Yes.
10456610	10457371	Hi, who is this?
10457972	10458873	I've got a bad echo.
10458893	10460675	Uh-oh, that's a problem.
10460695	10461156	Hold on a second.
10461356	10461717	I'm sorry.
10462878	10464480	I didn't expect you guys to pick up that quick.
10464681	10465502	Sure, we'll hold.
10468390	10469130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10499285	10527966	forgive me if you already touched on this I was in and out of the room yeah I know there's a lot of news going on in the world it's fine did you weigh in on the show about IGN's little fake or gay article no there was a part of me that didn't want to go there but if the listeners want to go there then fine why don't you do some reporting on this tell us a little bit about what happened and how you feel about it
10529335	10543849	Well, basically IGN took the time to write a little article detailing the sexuality of Yoshi and Turok, of all people.
10545090	10574134	and basically they went through this whole long detailed article explaining that Yoshi is, I believe they used the phrase technically queer or something to that effect because he is dating Birdo who apparently is a transsexual if I got the article right my browser is kind of going slow there for a minute
10576573	10578496	Yeah, so yeah.
10579297	10582883	I was told on Twitter that the article was actually written by somebody who is gay.
10584127	10585167	Which makes it stranger.
10585387	10586007	Yeah, I don't know.
10586027	10587128	It makes the whole thing weirder.
10587668	10592189	But, you know, as I mentioned on Twitter, articles are written to generate hits.
10592369	10594409	And that's one reason why I wouldn't link it for my Twitter.
10594470	10596030	Because I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.
10596590	10602011	And I think these sorts of rampant speculation, I don't know, it just adds fuel to all that stuff.
10602051	10603472	And it's just unnecessary.
10603772	10608353	Like, if you want to write an interesting article about sexuality, why not talk about, like...
10609933	10615614	The impact of that, or why are more games kind of not putting it in their storylines?
10615734	10620095	Or what is it that gay folks want in gaming?
10620175	10621375	Maybe like interview them.
10621635	10624116	It's probably the same thing as everyone else, to be honest, I'll tell you that.
10624436	10624956	You know, I don't know.
10625016	10627076	Just an article like that just seemed like so unnecessary.
10627176	10635258	Or give us an article with a developer for Dragon Age or one of those studios that actually put a gay character in the game about kind of like how they did it and how they made sure...
10635678	10641019	to kind of address the sensitivity by making it realistic without being a joke.
10641639	10642219	I don't know.
10643260	10650321	Other than like, oh, Birdo's gay because of a misprint that was in an instruction manual so many years ago because they used to rush the translation.
10650341	10651361	I mean, it's stupid.
10651441	10654662	But it actually has been official that Birdo is transgendered.
10655762	10656462	But still.
10656602	10660023	Wasn't that confirmed in Captain Rainbow or something like that?
10660163	10663884	That Nintendo Wii game that only came out in Japan several years ago?
10665579	10671204	Also, there's plenty of folks that would argue that just because you date somebody who's transsexual doesn't make you one sexuality or another.
10671284	10673927	I think some people just care too much about who's gay and who's straight.
10674067	10677490	I think just love whoever you want to love and be over it, you know?
10678190	10679311	But that's just me.
10682094	10683335	I'm all for equal rights.
10685337	10686878	Well, what did you think when you read the article?
10686898	10690241	Did it piss you off or were you like, eh, too many people are getting their panties ruffled over this?
10693052	10706199	When I first saw on IGN's Twitter, when I first saw the title of this, I didn't even have to click on it before I'm thinking, what are they fucking doing?
10706519	10710101	I mean, it just seemed like a desperate grab for hits.
10711830	10714631	It was unnecessary.
10715392	10718573	I mean, it just seemed like pure bullshit to me.
10719954	10725416	I mean, it's not an article that they needed to write.
10726237	10728038	It's not an editorial they needed to write.
10730159	10735861	I'm looking at our chatroom here and MegaBoyX is in our chatroom saying, yeah, the guy on IGN came out as gay recently.
10736241	10738162	He was just trying to write a fun article about it.
10738382	10739002	I don't know.
10739022	10744203	But see, I'm just kind of like, well, why not write an article about coming out as gay then in gaming culture?
10744363	10745204	Or, you know, why not?
10745864	10748084	It's just like, is Yoshi gay?
10748245	10749765	Is this so weird?
10749905	10750245	I don't know.
10750305	10751305	It's unnecessary.
10751465	10752346	It's unnecessary.
10752486	10755067	That's, I think, the best thing I can think of to describe it.
10755187	10756127	It was just unnecessary.
10758296	10765768	I know they were kind of joking about whether Yoshi was a man or a woman in Super Smash Bros.
10766509	10770776	during Snake and Otacon's conversation before a fight with Yoshi.
10773497	10781643	and I remember them just bickering back and forth about Buddy lays eggs but it's a boy.
10783064	10783604	Oh my gosh.
10784024	10787387	Alright, well we gotta let you go to get some more calls but do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10789088	10794411	I just want to tell Defective Candy thank you for I tell you what I want what I really really want over Twitter.
10795292	10798034	Alright, well I have one final thought for you along those lines.
10804403	10806584	That's not Viva Forever.
10830078	10831978	I don't know why you would be buying the collection now.
10832018	10834279	Maybe because Final Fantasy XIV is still broken.
10834599	10839220	But Final Fantasy XI, if you happen to want to join that right now, there's actually a good collection they have out there.
10839520	10844401	They updated their Ultimate Collection now with the Abysia Edition.
10844421	10851843	It includes basically the game, plus all the expansions, plus the extra Abysia items.
10853243	10855004	I guess expansions.
10855425	10856926	There are three add-on scenarios.
10857226	10857466	All for $20.
10857807	10861129	Okay, Loki, I want you to point at me and get ready to laugh.
10861349	10861530	Yeah.
10861650	10863731	Because I kind of want to go back and play.
10863791	10865633	Just for a couple weeks.
10865773	10869195	Just to relive old times.
10869235	10870496	Like revisiting an old friend.
10870556	10880204	And then on top of that, you do get a special beret that I guess will increase skill gain, extra movement speed, and both magic and health regeneration.
10883027	10885888	I guess a new edition will be available to download May 16th.
10887349	10889170	That's kind of cool.
10889190	10894553	It's just a small part of me that kind of wants to go hug an old friend.
10897775	10903739	And then there's rumor that Ocarina of Time 3D is going to be a limited initial release.
10905340	10905640	Why?
10906260	10911163	I mean, other than them being disappointed about the 3DS launch numbers...
10913283	10915126	Why would you do that?
10916067	10920532	Make it extremely small so that people are trying to find it?
10921193	10923215	See, Nintendo toys with their customers like that.
10923496	10924837	That's the type of company they are.
10925118	10925418	Awesome.
10926139	10926880	Well, I'll tell you what.
10927380	10931526	I'll free up one extra copy for those people looking for it because I'm not buying it.
10934818	10950109	And last but not least, if you don't like Madden, yet you still want a football game, All Pro Football 2K8, there's an editor that's been released for it, for the Xbox 360 version, using some file editing.
10950489	10952811	And this can be done on non-modded consoles, by the way.
10954132	10956594	You can actually update your rosters.
10957374	10959696	You can also create custom teams.
10960356	10964980	I guess adjusting stats and players and all that stuff.
10965240	10971945	Ratings, abilities, physical appearance, and basically create your own teams if you want.
10972906	10975728	Or base them off of the actual NFL teams.
10977609	10980572	And I'm sure All-Pro Football 2K8 is probably dirt cheap nowadays.
10980592	10980972	Right.
10983755	10988061	So if you're interested in that, check out operationsports.com.
10988161	10989382	They had a feature running on it.
10989462	10993748	It's Flying Finn Releases All-Pro Football 2K8 Editor.
10995765	10996145	That's it.
11021167	11025618	So, what do we talk about for a few more minutes while we wait for the phones to ring?
11025638	11027002	This is such a funny image.
11029054	11033277	Oh, one of the... Yeah, someone finally did like a little image of Obama.
11033297	11035798	It says, sorry it took so long to get you a copy of my birth certificate.
11035878	11037659	I was too busy killing Osama Bin Laden.
11038360	11039200	That's funny.
11039860	11040281	I don't know.
11041641	11041982	I don't know.
11042342	11046684	I don't want to... I have things I want to say, but I don't want to get too political on the show.
11046864	11052948	But I'm just... I just hope that this will be the first step in this all being over.
11053528	11054989	So that's all I'll say on that.
11056790	11057110	All right.
11058331	11060593	Well, I guess that's it.
11060793	11061233	We're done.
11061333	11063715	We're going to go ahead and close up the lines.
11063755	11066517	It's 1230 on the East Coast anyway, so we're done.
11066937	11069459	Let's go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
11069499	11070720	But first, let me also say this.
11072542	11077265	If you liked Orange Lounge Radio, if you like the show here, do help spread the word about the show.
11077585	11080788	Tell a friend or a nice five-star review on iTunes is great too.
11081028	11082989	There's been some really nice ones written in the past couple days.
11083069	11083990	Really appreciate it, you guys.
11084290	11086812	I do read them and they make me smile, so thank you guys so much.
11086972	11088013	Very much for those that leave those.
11089033	11089614	Really appreciate it.
11090054	11091775	So let's go around and give everybody's final thought.
11092155	11094756	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
11096057	11097018	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11097978	11099059	Portal 2 is pretty awesome.
11099859	11100140	Chapter 2.
11100200	11101340	I'm getting into it.
11103041	11105703	My final thought is ice cream.
11107143	11107464	What?
11107924	11108164	I know.
11108664	11110125	There's Baskin Robbins around the corner.
11110485	11113287	I know, but they'll be closed by the time we're done with Afterbirth and all that.
11113769	11114869	Alright, that's it guys.
11114889	11116250	Thank you so much for listening to the show.
11116590	11120712	Let's hope that PSN comes back in the next week and maybe we'll forget about it by next week.
11121132	11121672	Likely not.
11121992	11125233	But all the latest in gaming news and all the good stuff and your voices.
11126014	11127994	Once again, same bat time, same bat channel.
11128014	11128715	We'll see you next week.
11128735	11129275	Thanks everybody.
11130055	11132756	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
