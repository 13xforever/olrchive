0	19260	Today, May 1st, 2011, the PlayStation Network remains down after an entire week, Portal
19260	31900	2 plans free DLC and Nintendo plans a free game from the 3DS shop.
31900	35280	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35280	39200	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39200	47280	We are live with episode number 411, the 411 if you will, on this May 1st of 2011.
47280	50300	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, with
50300	53560	me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53560	55960	I will not put you in a potato.
55960	56960	Thank you.
56960	57960	And feed you two birds.
57960	58960	That's great.
58960	62680	Actually it's kind of funny because I saw, I was at Trader Joe's today, which by the
62680	68000	way, super crowded grocery store today, it was a madhouse, and there was some hash browns
68000	72120	that were on sale and the little label on it says, when I grow up, I want to be hash
72120	75620	browns and I couldn't help but think of, you know, the same thing.
75620	76880	So anyhow.
76880	81400	I gave inadvertent spoilers today, sorry.
81400	84440	And the one she was spoiling of course was the one and only tech master, Loki!
84440	85840	I asked, so it's alright.
85840	86840	That's right, yeah.
86840	88320	Let's keep the show spoiler free guys, don't worry about it.
88320	89320	How you doing, Loki?
89320	90320	I'm doing fine.
90320	94040	And long time no see, it's been a little while because we were off two weeks ago and then
94040	98440	last week, Easter week, you were like, oh, I gotta do family stuff because I have a baby
98440	101480	now, so family stuff's important, so whatever, Loki.
101480	103640	So, well how's it going?
103640	104640	It's going alright.
104640	109320	Any, uh, anything exciting going on with the baby and that whole stuff?
109320	114000	He's scooting forward now, which means he'll be crawling hopefully soon.
114000	115120	Awesome.
115120	116520	I saw the video.
116520	118160	He looks so proud of himself.
118160	119680	He is very proud of himself.
119680	122680	He's like, I can move!
122680	124400	Just wait till I start walking!
124400	128900	Today he learned how to smack mommy in the face when she's not listening and gave her
128900	129900	a bloody nose.
129900	130900	Oh no.
130900	131900	What?
131900	132900	Oh no.
132900	138080	No, he, he just got, he gets excited sometimes and he, he's like flails around and you know.
138080	140040	He still doesn't have fine motor control.
140040	145400	Whoever's holding him is, you know, subjected to the brunt of his attack.
145400	146960	Has he tugged on your face?
146960	151560	No, he does it all the time.
151560	155800	Alright well, we're going to start off the show of course with how was your gaming week
155800	157320	and the video games you've been playing this week.
157320	159920	However, I do want to of course introduce the chat room because they're always there
159920	160920	with us.
160920	163780	You can go to chat.orangelauntrader.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night
163780	166400	where gamers seem to be very opinionated this week.
166400	172520	I can't possibly imagine what could possibly have so many people with so many polarizing
172520	173520	opinions.
173520	178000	It couldn't be that we're on day 11 of a certain network being down, which is certainly the
178000	179000	longest anything like this has ever happened.
179000	181600	Oh my god, UPN's down?
181600	182600	UPN's down?
182600	187520	UPN merged with C, what is it, Warner Brothers years ago, just so you know.
187520	188640	Alright, anyhow.
188640	193560	All that aside, certainly, we'll get into that, but first, a little lighter fare, how
193560	195640	was your gaming week and what games you've been playing this week?
195640	196640	DarkSakura.
196640	198680	I've been playing a lot of stuff.
198680	204360	I played DDR on Wednesday, I went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza, which was actually
204360	206100	pretty good.
206100	209320	So I cannot call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza anymore.
209320	215400	It was Julian's 4th birthday, and so we did the twister and everything, and he was a big
215400	216560	boy and went on that.
216560	218480	John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.
218480	219840	It was actually pretty good.
219840	221200	It was actually really good.
221200	223340	They're Alfredo Pizza, it was pretty good.
223340	226820	How long has it been since you've had pizza?
226820	228860	It was pretty good.
228860	232280	Because I managed to get those both when they were fresh, the pizzas I had.
232280	236200	I'm a pizza snob and I think their pizza's terrible, but that's because I haven't had
236200	237200	it in a while.
237200	238200	But anyway.
238200	239200	Foodio.
239200	240200	I like the macaroni and cheese pizza.
240200	242800	By the way, speaking of food, would you please tell the listeners what you had before the
242800	243920	show tonight?
243920	246480	I had a fish taco.
246480	248720	Thank you, Rob, for my taco.
248720	253640	And dammit people, I asked for more than 10, not more than 30.
253640	258960	And yeah, if you have no idea why Dark Soccer was rewarded with a taco earlier tonight,
258960	260200	you have to listen to last week's show.
260200	263840	I just like that I completely bullshitted you into getting me a taco.
263840	265120	I was kind of fucked up.
265120	266560	Next time I want something.
266560	267560	Rob.
267560	268560	What?
268560	270440	How about after the show I get you paintberry?
270440	273560	That would be amazing if I didn't have work in the morning, and I already foresee this
273560	274560	show running long.
274560	276720	Okay, how about after my finals are done?
276720	277720	Okay.
277720	278720	We go celebrate at paintberry.
278720	279720	My treat.
279720	280720	That works for me.
280720	281720	Okay.
281720	282720	Sorry, back to games.
282720	283720	I'll buy Alan some too.
283720	284720	Okay.
284720	285720	So.
285720	288880	I played some Ditter, and I played this percussion master game that's supposed to be like Taiko
288880	293520	no Tatsujin, only it's a lot different and kind of sucky, and had really bad covers of
293520	294520	songs in there.
294520	296320	But I had fun playing it.
296320	301960	And then I played After Burner Climax in the arcade, because that's the only arcade machine
301960	303880	I've seen, and I love that game.
303880	305840	Did it make you climax?
305840	309160	No, but I was moist.
309160	316720	Because, you know, I just got done playing DDR, I was like, okay.
316720	322600	And then I got Portal 2, which I got two days ago.
322600	324240	I got it Friday night.
324240	329320	And I'm already almost caught up with you, because I had bad insomnia.
329320	333520	My problem is that I'm only playing it on Steam, because, you know, I'm kind of glad
333520	341200	I don't have the Playstation 1, because of certain malfunctions, and excuse me while
341200	345320	I clean something up off the floor.
345320	349760	So, and because, you know, I honestly wouldn't have played it on the console anyway, so I'm
349760	351620	really digging playing it on Steam.
351620	354520	I play with a trackball mouse, which I'm having a good time.
354520	361040	But yeah, I have just found, well, it's a little bit of a spoiler, but I don't care,
361040	362040	I'll say it anyway.
362040	364360	It's called potatoes.
364360	368280	As they refer to her on the Half-Life Wiki as potatoes.
368280	371040	So it's been pretty cool.
371040	374560	You've heard me bitching about puzzles that make me violently ill.
374560	377000	Hey, it's my husband, I think.
377000	378000	No, it's a visitor.
378000	380000	It's a friend.
380000	389680	Anyway, so, uh, I also, uh, crap, what else did I play?
389680	392880	I played some Dragon Age, but I'm kind of forgetting about Dragon Age for now.
392880	396720	I'm gonna go ahead and give it back, because I've got Portal, although I'm probably gonna
396720	399240	end up having it beaten, like, in the next couple days.
399240	402580	And I got level 60, um, for Rebecca Black.
402580	403580	On WoW.
403580	404580	On WoW.
404580	405580	World of Warcraft.
405580	407960	You still have to play co-op, because co-op's a lot of fun, too.
407960	408960	Co-op WoW?
408960	409960	No, co-op Portal, dummy.
409960	412680	Don't call me dummy dummy.
412680	416880	I booted Darwinia.
416880	421800	But Portal, I'm kind of like, oooh, it's pretty.
421800	422880	It really is pretty.
422880	426400	I've been taking tons of screen captures, because my favorite thing in this game so
426400	434960	far are the, um, the work posters that are like, but for me being, you know, a big graphic
434960	440960	design nerd, I love how perfectly they capture the styles of each era, you know, the further
440960	445920	along that you're in the facility, like the stuff from the 40s and 50s, and then the 60s
445920	452600	style logo, and as you move up through the facility, and you come to the modern age,
452600	458600	you see just, they really did capture the design of those different eras really nicely.
458600	461520	And I love the allergen poster.
461520	463240	It's like, know your allergens.
463240	464240	Pollen.
464240	465240	Pet dander.
465240	466240	Plastic.
466240	467240	Antimatter.
467240	475280	And the, the, the, please let us know if you see anyone from the FDA, the FHA.
475280	479620	There's lots of great little jokes just in the artwork, and that's, that's, you know,
479620	482760	part of what makes this game so phenomenal is that, you know, there's just, you can just
482760	487440	be kind of walking around looking at the scenery, and it's not just the, you know, very similar
487440	488440	to the first game.
488440	490800	Remember how they were like the cave drawing type of things?
490800	491800	Which are still there.
491800	496240	Yeah, they're there, and you know, they're not totally throughout, but you find them
496240	497240	in certain places.
497240	498240	Well, you know why?
498240	499240	The signs or jokes do.
499240	500960	You know why they're not fully, fully through there?
500960	502360	Can you tell me without spoiling?
502360	503720	Well read the lab rat comic.
503720	504720	Okay, alright.
504720	508520	There's a comic that ties Portal to Portal 2 called Lab Rat.
508520	509680	It's a free PDF.
509680	516120	You can get it on the Valve website, and it talks about Ratman, who was the guy that was
516120	523040	living in the facilities hiding, and he apparently was a scientist, and was, he's the reason
523040	525320	that Chella's the one being tested.
525320	531600	Because while she wasn't the smartest or the most athletic, she had the most tenacity.
531600	534040	And it says on her, never ever gives up.
534040	537880	So she was initially rejected as a test subject.
537880	538880	And he moved her forward.
538880	539880	And this is all in the comic.
539880	540880	Yeah, all in the comic.
540880	542360	So you're just spoiling the comic, not the game.
542360	544240	Well, there's more to it.
544240	550140	Like there's a lot more to Ratman, and there's a lot more to her, and just different stuff
550140	551140	that goes on in there.
551140	555180	So it's actually pretty, it's a good little tie-in, and also if you haven't seen the restored
555180	561240	ending for Portal, that ties in as well.
561240	564320	Coming into our chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Defective Candy is sad.
564320	566840	I'm poor, I can't buy Portal.
566840	568280	You're probably not alone.
568280	571480	And it's inevitable there will be a huge sale on Steam at some point.
571480	574200	And I would anticipate it's probably going to be around the time the first batch of download
574200	575520	content comes out.
575520	579000	It will be, you know, hey, are you still not on Portal?
579000	580160	Get it now, half off.
580160	582000	Because Valve likes to do ridiculous sales.
582000	583000	So you know, not all the news is bad.
583000	584000	Portal's ten bucks right now.
584000	586000	The only, well, I mean, Portal 2.
586000	587360	Yeah, Portal 2, yeah.
587360	594560	Well everybody can, you know, just watch their retail stores because they're doing POS backend
594560	602400	rebates for retailers through now and I think June?
602400	603460	Or the end of June?
603460	608340	So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing it down to 30 or 40 bucks.
608340	609960	What is a POS backend?
609960	615520	POS backend rebate means point of sale, so each, basically they get it for cheaper.
615520	621520	Each one they sell, they track how many they sell and they get a rebate from the publisher
621520	622520	for it.
622520	626200	So it's an incentive to get them to bring in more product because they get to sell it
626200	627200	for cheaper.
627200	631120	Just sort of like buying a mask, buying bulk, right?
631120	632160	Well, sort of.
632160	638040	That's what happened with those, the five retailers that had the Wii systems for $170
638040	640040	because that wasn't offered to everybody.
640040	643860	That was only the top five direct retailers got offered that.
643860	648840	But with Portal 2, it's a little bit flexible, so they're getting a week where they get the
648840	649840	market down.
649840	653780	So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing down different weeks from
653780	655960	now to the end of June.
655960	658360	Tiger Claw says, let's not forget about Cave Johnson.
658360	660080	He has some of the funniest stuff.
660080	664520	I love him and I didn't realize it at first, but it's the dude that played J. Jonah Jameson
664520	667320	in the Spiderman movies and he's perfect.
667320	676160	And I love Carolyn, which I won't say anything more about her, but I knew right away it was
676160	677640	the same voice actor.
677640	683360	So I love her speaking voice, but I love listening to her sing.
683360	689240	Not just the Jonathan Colton songs, but singing like she actually did the opera.
689240	690240	She's an operatic singer.
690240	694520	So I've actually gone back and listened to her sing other stuff and her voice is astounding.
694520	698800	Really, really gorgeous.
698800	703800	So really most of my time has been taken up with Portal 2.
703800	709240	For all of my motion sickness, I have been breezing through it, except for the parts
709240	713280	that I scream and yell at, which are usually, oh my God, I threw up.
713280	718040	You said something on Facebook the other night about having played for a little bit, but
718040	720060	got too motion sick and you had to quit.
720060	723520	And I was kind of like, oh, she probably only got, you know, maybe she got through like
723520	725080	the first two chapters or something.
725080	726080	But no, I'm here tonight.
726080	727080	You're already on chapter seven.
727080	728080	Yeah.
728080	729080	I just started chapter seven.
729080	730080	So you almost caught up to me.
730080	731080	I just got to chapter eight last night.
731080	732080	So.
732080	735880	Which I'm just a few stages away from that really.
735880	738500	And I'm, I'm totally digging it.
738500	742360	The last fight though, I'm, I'm not going to spoil it because I did actually watch play
742360	743680	throughs a few times.
743680	748180	The last fight looks freaking difficult, but fun too at the same time.
748180	749680	So I'm looking forward to that.
749680	750680	All right.
750680	753760	Well, uh, if that does it for dark soccer's gaming week, then let's go to Loki and ask
753760	754760	Loki.
754760	755760	How was your gaming week?
755760	760080	Um, I didn't play a lot of anything actually just grand theft auto really cause I've been
760080	764440	playing, um, well I've been editing stuff in grand theft auto.
764440	766560	That's all I really been doing the last two weeks.
766560	772800	Um, well actually I did play like a few other small things, just mainly, um, play a little
772800	778580	bit of unpleasant horse, which is the new iOS game from, um, pop cap.
778580	782600	It's their, um, kind of spin off company that's doing it.
782600	785960	And it's funny because I don't know if there's more of these types of games coming.
785960	790480	I think there are, um, it's free, but what the premise of the game, the way they came
790480	795440	up with it is they had a hat with a bunch of random names in it, just different parts
795440	796440	of a name.
796440	802400	And so they pull out the name for the game and they have 48 hours to complete the, you
802400	805400	know, coding the game.
805400	810040	And so the premise of unpleasant horse is you're this unpleasant looking unicorn fat
810040	817700	chubby horse and, uh, you fly around or hop from cloud to cloud trying to land on happy
817700	825680	white, um, unicorn horses or whatever Pegasus is, I guess, and you crush them and make them
825680	829240	fall into meat grinders.
829240	830240	That's it.
830240	831240	It's hilarious.
831240	837560	Um, but yeah, definitely worth checking out since it's free and it's fun, especially if
837560	842640	you like horse violence like I do.
842640	843640	So that's it.
843640	847440	Well, you know, we covered, um, was it fourth and battery?
847440	849400	We covered that on the show a few weeks ago.
849400	850400	Right?
850400	851400	Yeah.
851400	852760	No, I remember the story about how it took a little while for them to get on the store,
852760	855880	but yeah, I didn't even realize the game had actually come out.
855880	859000	I, last I'd heard it had been delayed, so that's cool.
859000	865000	And then, um, let's see what else, uh, it was a really cool, actually I just real quick,
865000	868240	there was a really cool story in the, um, I was making the rounds on the blogs this
868240	870960	week and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'll mention it here.
870960	875920	I hear that PopCap designed some game as part of a make a wish thing for a nine year old.
875920	876920	I thought that was very cool.
876920	879680	Yeah, I think that's out there now to games of the aisle store too.
879680	880680	It's very cool.
880680	881960	I'm trying to think other stuff.
881960	888520	Oh, I was going to mod my laptop because, um, these wonderful aces laptops are not meant
888520	894920	for proper cooling and so I'm modding the back of it so I can play some more graphic
894920	898480	intensive games without feeling like my lap is on fire.
898480	904040	Um, and then, uh, let's see, other than gaming, I mentioned a few weeks back, and this is
904040	910720	really hilarious, um, how I was taking a test or whatever to get into Mensa while I passed
910720	911720	that test.
911720	913280	So I'm in Mensa now.
913280	914280	Congrats.
914280	917000	I don't know what to say.
917000	918000	So now what?
918000	919400	What do you do as a Mensa member?
919400	921280	Because now is that going to be your thing now?
921280	926120	Your little MO on the show is that, well Rob, as a, as a member of Mensa, I think my opinion
926120	927120	matters here.
927120	928120	I need to tell you.
928120	929120	Nothing.
929120	930920	I just want the plaque or whatever.
930920	931920	Your resume, right?
931920	932920	Yes.
932920	933920	You're wondering.
933920	934920	Hang it up in your office.
934920	935920	It's basically, yeah.
935920	936920	There you go.
936920	937920	I don't know.
937920	941240	I can attend a seminar if I want to or something, but go hang out with all the smart people.
941240	943600	All I can say is I can analyze games.
943600	945640	Where's your Mensa placard?
945640	946640	Fucking Michael Pachter.
946640	947640	Yeah, that's right.
947640	949040	I don't think you have one.
949040	954040	I guess my opinion means a little bit more than yours, so.
954040	955040	Nice.
955040	958840	Um, I was going to say you need to go to one of these Mensa conventions and I want to see
958840	959840	some Mensa hotties.
959840	960840	Mensa hotties?
960840	963360	I want to see a blog of Mensa hotties.
963360	966640	You're going to be all like looking like librarians, I bet.
966640	969040	That's now that's a stereotype, Dark Sakura.
969040	970040	That is a stereotype.
970040	971040	Vicious stereotype.
971040	972040	Does Loki look like a librarian?
972040	973040	I don't look like a librarian.
973040	976040	I was talking about the women, but okay.
976040	977040	Librarians are hot though.
977040	981280	No, it's just, I just, I don't even know why I took the test.
981280	985040	Sara Palin was kind of hot until she opened her mouth.
985040	986340	Anyway.
986340	987340	That all depends.
987340	991040	I mean, your opinion of Sara Palin, I mean, it might be even hotter if she opened her
991040	997340	mouth, but then when she started talking though, then that just went downhill.
997340	999040	Some people like them stupid, I guess.
999040	1000040	No, I, I don't know.
1000040	1002040	I just thought it was funny.
1002040	1003040	But yeah.
1003040	1004040	All right.
1004040	1006040	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk about my gaming week.
1006040	1008040	Oh, and I just did a, sorry, sorry.
1008040	1010040	I just did a street pass thing with Rob.
1010040	1013040	So now I actually have two me's on my 3DS now.
1013040	1014040	Yay.
1014040	1015940	That's the first time my 3DS is street pass.
1015940	1016940	You know, it's awesome.
1016940	1018740	I talked about getting the 3DS on the show last week.
1018740	1019740	You know, it's awesome.
1019740	1021740	I went to the mall yesterday.
1021740	1026520	I went to the mall in the really nice part of town where all the spoiled rich kids are.
1026520	1027520	I went there.
1027520	1029020	I went to Best Buy.
1029020	1034340	I went to some other stores and I was like, oh, I've got a street pass with someone.
1034340	1037540	If it's like the demo unit in Best Buy, I'm going to street pass with someone before this
1037540	1038540	day's over.
1038540	1043840	I get home and I see, oh, uh, apparently the wireless was turned off the entire time.
1043840	1048080	That was really smart of me because you know, they put the wireless switch on the 3DS exactly
1048080	1050440	where they put the power switch on the old DS's.
1050440	1051440	Yeah.
1051440	1053440	God damn it.
1053440	1054440	Anyhow.
1054440	1062040	Oh, apparently I'm getting a link from Derek H in our chat room is actually linking us
1062040	1070800	to this, uh, website here as a part of cha cha.com I like this, uh, hot Mensa members.
1070800	1076040	And it's actually a link of some hot people that are Mensa members, some celebrities.
1076040	1079480	Well, I guarantee I'm not part of that list.
1079480	1083200	You are not because all these people have tits, Loki.
1083200	1085240	You do not have tits.
1085240	1086240	That's true.
1086240	1088200	Derek H, Gina Davis, Asia Carrera.
1088200	1089200	She's pretty hot.
1089200	1090200	Uh, she's not hot.
1090200	1091760	Well, Gina Davis is just getting old.
1091760	1092760	She was really hot.
1092760	1093760	Like 20 years ago.
1093760	1094760	Well, that's 20 years ago.
1094760	1095760	Anyhow.
1095760	1096760	What the hell?
1096760	1098480	Why do they have a little kid on there?
1098480	1099480	That's just weird.
1099480	1100480	All right.
1100480	1101480	Let's move on.
1101480	1106400	Uh, my gaming week, more of the same, uh, portal, of course, portal to, as I mentioned
1106400	1107400	before, I'm a chapter.
1107400	1111760	I also play some co-op, uh, obviously not on PSM, but I played on steam, which was a
1111760	1112760	lot of fun.
1112760	1116400	And, uh, you know, we weren't using voice chat at all because, uh, I was playing with
1116400	1120740	Miek Latov and the way his place is set up, he couldn't talk cause he would wake someone
1120740	1122000	up who was sleeping.
1122000	1126600	So, uh, I was, I was playing with him and we were using the text chat to type back and
1126600	1127600	forth.
1127600	1130640	And then portal also has, if you use like the F key, you can like point at things like
1130640	1133000	telling people where to put the portals.
1133000	1134000	So it was nice.
1134000	1136680	And like when I would get really frustrated, I'd hit F like a thousand times on the point
1136680	1139160	where I want to, you know, have him put a portal.
1139160	1140160	So that was fun.
1140160	1141160	I like that.
1141160	1142160	You each have a terminus?
1142160	1143160	Uh, yeah.
1143160	1144160	Oh yeah.
1144160	1145160	You each, it's like four portals.
1145160	1148600	All the co-op puzzles are four portals because you each have a portal guy.
1148600	1151280	So it's not like one's not the orange and the other's the blue.
1151280	1152280	Nope.
1152280	1155440	One's dark blue and light blue and the other one's dark orange and like, or I should say
1155440	1157500	light orange and red sort of thing.
1157500	1158500	So yeah.
1158500	1162120	I know that, um, in the original portal back, if you look at the beta pictures of it, they
1162120	1165180	had a purple and pink portal originally.
1165180	1167280	I was wondering if they maybe had borrowed the same scheme.
1167280	1168280	Perhaps.
1168280	1169280	I'm sure there's lots of ideas.
1169280	1172180	Well, you know, at one point portal two wasn't even supposed to be half portals.
1172180	1174920	That was one thing they were talking about was that it was going to be a whole new concept
1174920	1175920	in their game.
1175920	1179480	But actually that's where the gels come from, where there's like there's blue gels and orange
1179480	1180480	gels and white gels.
1180480	1185000	They got that from another game that was done by some more students at DigiPen.
1185000	1186000	Really?
1186000	1192160	Um, that and there's only one gel that they didn't take from that game that is like a
1192160	1193160	sticky, I think.
1193160	1194160	I'd have to look it up again.
1194160	1198680	But yeah, they took the repulsion and propulsion gel from another game and they actually hired
1198680	1200040	them all to help work with portal two.
1200040	1202160	The white gel is portal wall gel.
1202160	1203160	Yeah.
1203160	1204160	Moon rocks!
1204160	1206400	You can have a portal wherever you want.
1206400	1211560	So yeah, that wasn't supposed to have portals, but yeah, the game is still fun, exciting.
1211560	1212560	Co-op mode is great.
1212560	1215520	I haven't beat it yet, but we're probably like, I don't know, like think we're through
1215520	1217400	three of the areas.
1217400	1221040	So I think there's like five or six.
1221040	1223360	Been playing a little bit of Mortal Kombat, but not a lot.
1223360	1225680	A little more Street Fighter on the 3DS, but not a lot.
1225680	1230960	The one new game I've been playing a lot of this week is the Final Fantasy IV collection
1230960	1231960	on the PSP.
1231960	1237160	You might've forgot because it came out on a huge week, but that game came out and it's
1237160	1241840	redone versions of Final Fantasy IV, which of course was originally released as Final
1241840	1245640	Fantasy II in the United States, but it's IV in the canon.
1245640	1249300	It is not only the original Final Fantasy IV game redone.
1249300	1255160	It is redone in the style of Final Fantasy I and II on the PSP or I and II on the iPhone,
1255160	1259040	which was taken from the PSP versions, not III, which was taken from the DS versions.
1259040	1263200	But IV has been reimagined like I and II were with redone sprites, redone music.
1263200	1267360	Really cool though, you can go in and enable the original music if you'd like to hear that.
1267360	1272400	It's the modern translation, not the original Ted Woosley one from the 90s that's out.
1272400	1273400	You spoonie bard!
1273400	1277080	Well, they keep that line in, they have to keep that line in, but the rest is the proper
1277080	1283040	story with all the proper text for everything.
1283040	1287640	And it also has the After Years, the complete set of the After Years games, which were released
1287640	1292120	for several bucks a pop on the Wii, and did not have souped up graphics at all, it was
1292120	1295260	just the same graphics from the original Super Nintendo version.
1295260	1299980	So it's pretty cool that they released all that in one package, and it has a transition
1299980	1304400	episode that's completely brand new that transitions between the two games.
1304400	1309480	So all of it is new, very cool.
1309480	1315200	It's beautiful looking, I love that it's still 2D, like I don't hate the 3D one on the DS,
1315200	1319520	I mean it was great and I'm glad they did that, but it's nice to kind of play it still
1319520	1323440	the old school way, just with all the souped up graphics, like I wish this is what we could
1323440	1328160	get more of on like Arcade or Virtual Console for fuck's sake, like this would be a great
1328160	1329840	thing for them to have released.
1329840	1336080	But it works great on the PSP, looks beautiful, different transition graphics for the battles,
1336080	1340960	the battles look great, the magic's all been redone so it looks very high def and everything.
1340960	1344960	It's great, I'm really enjoying it, it's a great value for a Final Fantasy fan.
1344960	1348320	You know if you're not into the older Final Fantasy games, you don't really have the same
1348320	1351260	appreciation for them, I don't know if there will be a lot here for you.
1351260	1353880	I have a bad feeling it's not going to sell very well because I think it just came out
1353880	1355760	at a real crap time.
1355760	1359880	Hopefully it will sell a bit in catalog sales, I really want to see 5 and 6 get the same
1359880	1363760	retreatment, especially 6, it will be very nice.
1363760	1366120	So hopefully they'll sell a lot of 4.
1366120	1368180	And that's the other game I've been playing.
1368180	1373120	So that's really been about it, oh no, one other game I played, this is very important
1373120	1379080	because I promised last week on the show I would finally try it and I did, I played Minecraft.
1379080	1384240	And I gotta say Minecraft, the website is not, I'm going to just be honest, this is
1384240	1387440	my true reaction, a lot of people are going to think I'm an idiot and that's fine, but
1387440	1388440	I'll own up to it.
1388440	1391840	I did not find the Minecraft site to be very user friendly because it took me a minute
1391840	1396240	to kind of figure out there's like an old version that's free or there's an old multiplayer
1396240	1400000	or there's a new one that you can pay for and a new multiplayer, there's so many different
1400000	1403960	modes and the website's kind of dated looking and whatever.
1403960	1409960	So I finally found my way into the game and I played it and I don't get it, I don't get
1409960	1410960	the big deal.
1410960	1415720	Sorry guys, I don't understand why people are hailing Minecraft, it's like oh my god!
1415720	1419720	Maybe it's more fun with more people or whatever, but I found it to be about as thrilling as
1419720	1423640	the program from Lego that lets you build your own Lego structures and then you can
1423640	1427280	order the bricks and actually build them.
1427280	1432200	Don't get me wrong, that's kind of awesome too, but I did not think Minecraft was like
1432200	1434400	OMG!
1434400	1435400	I agree with you.
1435400	1436400	Did you play it too?
1436400	1439000	I've played Minecraft, I didn't care for it.
1439000	1440000	And that made me kind of sick.
1440000	1444200	Well, yeah, I mean, but you've got the whole first person shooter thing going on that you
1444200	1446160	don't usually do well with those.
1446160	1448720	But I just, I didn't get it.
1448720	1452040	I don't think it's put together very well either, I think it's not presented very well.
1452040	1456120	I guess it's one of those like hipster things that like if you're into it you're hip because
1456120	1464920	it's like hard to get in there and play and all that and build these things, whatever.
1464920	1469520	For some reason I was reminded of a really old game on the Super Nintendo called Populous
1469520	1472920	where you could kind of build, and this is also on, I want to say like Amiga, I think
1472920	1477640	it was originally an Amiga game, and obviously I had a PC port at some point too, and you
1477640	1483480	like raised and lowered land to keep your people safe and you kind of like played god
1483480	1484480	so to speak.
1484480	1489760	I don't know why, but with the whole like building blocks and then taking them away,
1489760	1491360	I felt very populist to me.
1491360	1494360	And I got to admit like all these people are like hailing it, it's this great thing.
1494360	1498820	I feel like I've played something like it before, I didn't feel that innovative to me.
1498820	1503000	So sorry, I guess that makes me not cool, I'm not hip.
1503000	1505000	It's okay Rob, we forgive you.
1505000	1506000	Anyhow.
1506000	1507000	I don't think it's cool either.
1507000	1512260	Moving on, other housekeeping, you can always join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange
1512260	1513800	Lounge Radio.

1523120	1526080	No shows we're taking off in the foreseeable future.
1526080	1529760	We do have our ninth anniversary show coming up at the end of June, but that's still a
1529760	1534040	good six weeks away, so we'll give you more details on that as we get closer.
1534040	1539080	For now, let's get into gaming news, or as I should say, you have to remember what OLR
1539080	1540080	is all about.
1540080	1544640	We don't, it's very, very, very, very rare we ever break news on this show.
1544640	1549760	A lot of times, you know, we like to be friends, sitting around the table, talking smack about
1549760	1550760	games.
1550760	1553400	So sometimes it's about putting the news out there on the table to discuss.
1553400	1557880	So I don't think this is going to be news to anyone, but we need to put it out there
1557880	1558880	on the table.
1558880	1561720	So Loki, please, let's address the pink elephant in the room.
1561720	1564560	Whoa, whoa, wait a second, PlayStation network's been down?
1564560	1567480	Yes, it's been down.
1567480	1571760	I don't know if you've actually bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 or Mortal Kombat, which
1571760	1576440	were huge, huge releases on PS3 the week you were out, and now you can't play either of
1576440	1577440	them online.
1577440	1578440	Yeah.
1578440	1585400	I've never used PlayStation network, but yeah, it's been down for a while.
1585400	1593080	And you know, they even, they even went and had a press conference yesterday, ooh, press
1593080	1595520	conference, making everything official.
1595520	1598920	You know, hey, don't fear, everything's going to be okay.
1598920	1604240	But yeah, apparently they're going to be returning some services to the PlayStation network this
1604240	1608000	week, full services within this month.
1608000	1612800	And I just need to interrupt and say something, because this is really important, Loki.
1612800	1615800	Part of, you know, kind of the thing that, you know, with the hack and everything is
1615800	1621800	that credit card data was exposed, or at least they say possibly could have been compromised,
1621800	1624640	which hadn't come out at the time of last week's show.
1624640	1630000	And I just want to say, I called it, and I really hate being right sometimes.
1630000	1632720	That's the second time this year I've been right on some major news.
1632720	1635720	The other one we'll get to in a little bit, because I've not had a chance to gloat with
1635720	1640440	Loki here on the show, but I'll get my fair share in just after we cover this story.
1640440	1646960	All right, yeah, so the list of services that are returning to the PlayStation network this
1646960	1653840	week are the restoration of online gameplay across the PlayStation 3 and PSP systems,
1653840	1658360	licenses, including titles that require online verification and download games, access to
1658360	1663720	music unlimited power by curiosity, which I might add, curiosity is a terrible name
1663720	1672480	for a service, so thanks, Sony, for coming up with a new word that begins with Q.
1672480	1675840	Access to account management and password reset, well, that's important, considering
1675840	1678240	that, you know, our account's been breached and we need to change their passwords.
1678240	1679240	Well, you're not going to have a choice.
1679240	1682800	They're going to make you change your password when you come back on, that's a big, big part
1682800	1683800	of it.
1683800	1687320	Not only that, you have to do it from the original PS3.
1687320	1691760	Or an email thing, because, you know, some people have changed their PlayStation 3s.
1691760	1700880	PlayStation Home, oh goody, Friends List and chat functionality are coming back.
1700880	1701880	So yeah.
1701880	1708840	And then some other fun stuff, of course, they're also going to be, as their Welcome
1708840	1718200	Back program, they're going to be offering some free stuff for you, because they're sorry.
1718200	1723480	So the free stuff that they're going to be offering, a free download with, I believe
1723480	1729160	they were saying that was worth $20, maybe?
1729160	1736820	And then 30 days free of PlayStation Plus, I'm rolling my eyes.
1736820	1744400	And Curiosity, I guess a free membership to Curiosity or something like that.
1744400	1747760	Yes, 30 days of Curiosity.
1747760	1752340	Yeah, I like how those last two bits, oh yeah, we're just going to give you a trial to those
1752340	1757480	so that maybe you might buy them after, you know, the trial's up.
1757480	1758480	And a download.
1758480	1763240	You know, even though all your personal information's been stolen, one download should make you
1763240	1764880	forget all about that, right?
1764880	1765880	Eh?
1765880	1766880	No?
1766880	1767880	Maybe?
1767880	1772920	They didn't really say, yeah, the download price.
1772920	1779200	Kazurai was saying that, I guess, a few thousand yen worth of free downloads, so like $20 or
1779200	1780800	$25.
1780800	1785440	And yeah, that's interesting.
1785440	1790440	And then, of course, there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 firmware company with the
1790440	1794320	relaunch of the PlayStation Network, and they're saying that the network is physically being
1794320	1798520	rebuilt, because apparently it was just inferior as it was.
1798520	1804320	You know, it might help that if they didn't store these same, on the same servers, your
1804320	1809720	credit card information and all that stuff with these servers that actually sell product,
1809720	1814120	you know, they might want to keep that stuff separate in case one gets hacked, or the store
1814120	1816880	gets hacked, which is more likely.
1816880	1819360	So they're going to be doing that.
1819360	1825380	And they said, and of course, you know, I love it, to make them sound like they're really
1825380	1826380	on top of it.
1826380	1829960	Well, it's something we were planning on doing anyway, so we're just going to do it quicker
1829960	1831800	now.
1831800	1833080	We were on top of this.
1833080	1834080	Great.
1834080	1837080	I'm glad you were on top of it, so you knew that this was going to be a problem.
1837080	1838720	You just admitted to that.
1838720	1842960	And then, of course, you know, this is a real big deal, since, you know, about, they're
1842960	1848520	saying 70 million users worth of data have been leaked out, including credit card information.
1848520	1858520	So of course, Congress and Homeland Security are now forming task forces or, you know,
1858520	1860460	sending inquiries about what's going on.
1860460	1865120	So I guess Homeland Security and the FBI are going to be helping them out, you know, investigating
1865120	1869480	the data breach and all that stuff.
1869480	1872260	So I guess that's supposed to make us feel good.
1872260	1873260	So great.
1873260	1875240	Our tax money's going to this.
1875240	1881680	Well, I mean, it is only, like, I think the most major breach that's ever happened on
1881680	1886440	the internet type of thing, but, um, can I go off now?
1886440	1888520	Well, hold on.
1888520	1892720	There was a rumor that they were seeing it, um, the PlayStation, it was hacked through
1892720	1897880	a PlayStation 3, basically, you know, getting access to the store through custom firmware
1897880	1901160	or something like that, or some development side or something.
1901160	1902160	I don't know.
1902160	1903160	What if they staged this whole thing?
1903160	1904160	No.
1904160	1907960	The whole thing is, well, here's what it was, and it was really terrible, because all they
1907960	1911700	were doing the entire time was their, oh, those hackers, those hackers got in.
1911700	1917280	Yet there was never, oh, well, we're stupid, and we, you know, we didn't, you know, first
1917280	1919680	off, we didn't encrypt any of our personal data.
1919680	1920680	Haha!
1920680	1921680	Haha!
1921680	1922680	That's funny, you know?
1922680	1924000	We'll laugh about that later on.
1924000	1930020	And then second, you know, their servers were the same servers for, you know, all that stuff.
1930020	1931020	It's ridiculous.
1931020	1932020	Okay.
1932020	1939800	Um, I'm not going to be a satisfied PlayStation because I, you, you can throw all this free
1939800	1944320	shit at me, although I don't think, honestly, and this is one of the pro Sony things I'm
1944320	1948440	going to say, because I, I don't consider myself a Sony fanboy or an Xbox fanboy or
1948440	1949440	any of it.
1949440	1955800	I, I, I chew out everyone equally, because I love gaming, and these companies screw things
1955800	1957680	up and it's usually at a management level.
1957680	1959040	It makes me angry.
1959040	1964720	Um, and what makes me, the, the free stuff here, I don't think actually Sony really owes
1964720	1967400	you anything for free, because the network was free in the first place.
1967400	1971760	And, you know, if your credit card gets hacked, you don't ask the bank for free money.
1971760	1977120	I mean, you have a protection with your bank that the bank will, you know, look, if you
1977120	1979320	have a fraudulent charge, you're protected against that.
1979320	1982780	If you have any type of decent credit card or bank, you're protected against fraud and
1982780	1983780	all that stuff.
1983780	1988660	But there's still some onus on you to monitor your statements and monitor everything that's
1988660	1989660	going on.
1989660	1992400	But I think what they're really, it's not even necessarily, people think that they're
1992400	1994840	owed something for the network being down for a few days.
1994840	1998960	I think they're saying that they're owed something for the hassle of having to go through and
1998960	2002360	change all that information, get new credit cards and that kind of stuff.
2002360	2007060	Well, and yeah, I, I can understand that, but at the same time, if you weren't monitoring
2007060	2012560	your stuff before, you're an idiot, like, sorry, but this should have been a severe
2012560	2016640	wake up call to you if you haven't been monitoring your stuff before, because you could get your
2016640	2019860	stuff stolen from a gas pump from one of those readers.
2019860	2023200	You could get your stuff stolen from any clerk or any waiter at a restaurant that you give
2023200	2024200	your cards to.
2024200	2026920	You know, your card number gets out there exposed all the time.
2026920	2031120	You have to monitor that stuff and if this didn't serve as a wake up call to you, I don't
2031120	2032120	know what to tell you.
2032120	2036240	Well, honestly, the best way around any real risk is use cash.
2036240	2040520	Well, I suppose there's that too, but I don't want to be, I don't want to be tinfoil hat
2040520	2041520	either.
2041520	2045660	You know, my agreement with the bank, I'm fucking paying visa, right?
2045660	2049160	Because they get, there's either the interest that they're making off the credit card to
2049160	2052560	begin with, or in the case of debit cards, they take a percentage of the sale and so
2052560	2053560	forth.
2053560	2058680	These companies are paid to prevent fraud.
2058680	2063080	My problem here is I need to hear more about how Sony is going to prevent this from happening
2063080	2064080	again.
2064080	2067480	I understand they're hiring a privacy officer, which is fine.
2067480	2071120	I understand that they're moving their data center, whether it was planned already or
2071120	2074680	not, whatever, at least they're finally understanding, whoops, we fucked up.
2074680	2078360	And it's kind of one of those fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
2078360	2082920	Because if they put the damn thing back up and then they just get hacked again, they're
2082920	2088240	going to be, they're going to be dead as a company, period.
2088240	2093480	It's just like when Jack in the Box, uh, killed the people with Ecoli, a couple, it was probably
2093480	2095180	about 15 years ago.
2095180	2099240	Right after that happened, they were the safest restaurant to eat at because you knew if they
2099240	2102580	were going to mess up again, they would be out of business, every single one of them.
2102580	2106320	And they've been able to recover from what was an unfortunate mess now, obviously very
2106320	2110040	different scenarios because you're talking lives are not at stake in this scenario, what's
2110040	2111360	going on with Sony.
2111360	2116460	However, there still is certainly, you know, a big passion, big, big headline news thing
2116460	2118120	going on here.
2118120	2125400	So, um, there's some other things to consider though, is that what Sony got is that, uh,
2125400	2129200	Sony needs to kind of ask themselves, you know, how are we going to prevent the hacking
2129200	2130880	happening in the future?
2130880	2133280	I'm not condoning the hacking at all.
2133280	2136720	And you know, I, cause I see some stuff going on in the chat, but I want to make it clear.
2136720	2142160	The ultimate problem is not with Sony, it's with the hackers and whoever went into the
2142160	2145260	system in the first place, they are the problem.
2145260	2149460	And let's be real, if they try to use that credit card data that was stolen at this,
2149460	2152240	this point, they're going to have the FBI up their ass.
2152240	2158020	If you're a hacker that did this, or you're somebody that buys this data from the hackers,
2158020	2162100	you are an absolute moron who's just begging to go to jail because you're going to have
2162100	2165060	every state agency so far up your butt.
2165060	2166160	I mean, let's be real.
2166160	2170420	So if you do have that data, you really shouldn't use it.
2170420	2171420	Let's be fair.
2171420	2172420	Okay.
2172420	2174380	Now, uh, and so I certainly don't condone that.
2174380	2178820	That's, you know, hacking to that level where you are stealing information, whatever.
2178820	2183140	And if they, if they are trying to sell it for a profit, as some folks are saying, it's
2183140	2187500	up on forums and so forth, but you know, what's real and what's trolling.
2187500	2188500	We don't know.
2188500	2189500	You know, where's the line drawn.
2189500	2191540	So I don't condone the hacking.
2191540	2195900	However, you can't help but feel like Sony kind of opened themselves up to it a little
2195900	2196900	bit.
2196900	2197900	Throwing this out.
2197900	2198900	Sony did.
2198900	2201820	Didn't Sony kind of come out in the school yard and kind of wave their hands saying,
2201820	2203280	come at us.
2203280	2207660	How many times do they get up there on the stage at E3 and say, our system is unhackable.
2207660	2209300	Wait, wait, wait.
2209300	2210300	Just throwing this out there.
2210300	2216140	And I'm not sure on the accuracy of the rumor, but let's just pretend that it's real here
2216140	2222820	because it would fall in line with the lack of dedication to safety, I guess, or of our
2222820	2223820	information.
2223820	2230700	Apparently, the rumor is that that credit card list was encrypted with the same keys
2230700	2234100	that they use for the PlayStation 3.
2234100	2236700	Oops.
2236700	2240460	So the point is, and what I really want to get at here, and this is how Sony can really
2240460	2247140	earn back my trust, stop being so fucking hard headed.
2247140	2250380	It is time to admit your vulnerability.
2250380	2253140	And this press conference yesterday didn't cut it.
2253140	2256620	It didn't cut it because essentially they came out there and they just, you know, they're
2256620	2261380	trying to point fingers at everybody else except themselves.
2261380	2264740	And honestly, what really needs to happen is management needs to be shaken up.
2264740	2267100	Kazurai needs to come down.
2267100	2268380	Sorry.
2268380	2272300	That's what is really going to make me happy is for PlayStation to change their management.
2272300	2274300	However, unfortunately, I don't see that happening.
2274300	2278380	Well, what's I think also going to restore a lot of faith that customers might have in
2278380	2281820	them is for them to display that level of accountability.
2281820	2284780	Accountability for me, especially as a big thing with a company.
2284780	2289940	And if I'm seeing none of that, then I'm not going to give them my business.
2289940	2293620	I mean, that's why I pretty much decided I don't think I'm going to get anything else
2293620	2294620	for PS3.
2294620	2298140	At the end of the day, I think Sony can win me back.
2298140	2301900	I mean, it's not like corporations don't do dumb things once in a while.
2301900	2305220	And excuse me, Xbox fanboys, excuse me.
2305220	2311020	The Red Ring of Death thing was atrocious and was horrible on Microsoft's part.
2311020	2313100	But they've come a long way since then, to be fair.
2313100	2314100	And they handled it well.
2314100	2317700	They finally did extend their warranty and they admitted their problem.
2317700	2319620	That's what I need Sony to do here.
2319620	2320620	Yeah.
2320620	2327460	But I don't, until they have some accountability, I don't think I'm going to give them my business.
2327460	2331620	I mean, but it's a hard situation because, you know, I can see how some of you are thinking,
2331620	2334420	well, Rob, is that saying what the hackers did is okay?
2334420	2336500	No, that's not what I'm saying.
2336500	2338860	What the hackers did is not okay.
2338860	2341100	But you know what I've said on the show before, hackers going to hack.
2341100	2346380	And you know, this news we've seen, this stuff about Sony and so forth, they really have
2346380	2347400	just been inviting it.
2347400	2352980	This whole thing about, we want to subpoena everybody's PlayStation 3 that ever accessed
2352980	2356780	a website even remotely related to this GeoHots thing.
2356780	2360700	When he admitted he wasn't even after coming after data in the first place, he just wanted
2360700	2362980	to get the other OS thing back or whatever.
2362980	2363980	I mean, let's be real.
2363980	2367500	This all traces back to Sony taking off the other OS feature.
2367500	2368500	Yeah.
2368500	2370660	If Sony had never done that, this would have never happened.
2370660	2371660	Yeah.
2371660	2373860	But hindsight, you know.
2373860	2374860	Right.
2374860	2377780	But maybe it needed to happen.
2377780	2382580	Maybe we were all getting a little too comfortable with this whole digital distribution thing.
2382580	2386940	Maybe this, you know, and I've said this before on the show and I still mean it.
2386940	2390260	This is going to set digital distribution back a little bit because this goes beyond
2390260	2391260	Sony.
2391260	2396660	This is going to affect that horrific copyright protection thing that Capcom has.
2396660	2399960	If you bought a game like Bionic Commander or whatever, you haven't been able to play
2399960	2402740	it for the past 11 days on PlayStation 3.
2402740	2405380	And we're having class action lawsuits against only Sony.
2405380	2406380	I'm sorry.
2406380	2407380	Someone needs to file one against Capcom.
2407380	2408380	Yeah.
2408380	2409380	Sorry.
2409380	2410740	I can't play a game I bought.
2410740	2412940	That's your problem, that's kind of your problem.
2412940	2416340	You know, that's what I like to see happen.
2416340	2418340	No, I agree.
2418340	2420580	Alright, I'm going to chatroom.
2420580	2421580	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2421580	2425460	Derek H. in our chatroom says, I would like a press release saying they've hired a hit
2425460	2427820	team to track down and assassinate the hackers.
2427820	2430220	You know, it's interesting, I did feel like at that press conference day they were really
2430220	2432580	trying to finger point at Anonymous.
2432580	2433940	They don't even know who did it.
2433940	2437260	And I know they keep saying, well, it could be Anonymous, but you know, they said they
2437260	2440780	didn't do it, but you know, there's no head to Anonymous, so it could have been another
2440780	2441980	cell of Anonymous.
2441980	2446140	Yeah, but the whole thing was, I think, is people used Anonymous because there was that
2446140	2447940	whole conflict going.
2447940	2452080	So whoever it was that was planning on doing this probably said, oh, now seems like a good
2452080	2454180	time because they're going to be looking at them.
2454180	2455460	Or be distracted by them.
2455460	2457940	And so that's when they went and did it.
2457940	2464620	And if it was actually what they, the rumor is, where that it was part of this Rebug firmware
2464620	2470940	that was out there that gave you basically developer access that you could actually download
2470940	2472300	content for free and stuff.
2472300	2477020	That was one of the rumors I heard that they, one of the reasons that they took the store
2477020	2485100	down because someone found a way to basically steal PlayStation Network stuff.
2485100	2489900	But then again, you know, I don't know, they're not really being forthcoming with everything
2489900	2490900	that happened.
2490900	2496060	Even during their press conference, they're like, well, we can't confirm that anybody's
2496060	2500540	actually touched the credit card data that was even compromised.
2500540	2505220	So you know, they're kind of going back on saying, oh, well, you know, the credit card
2505220	2508580	stuff's not compromised, but here's all this stuff that you need to do to make sure that
2508580	2509700	your credit card's okay.
2509700	2513500	You know, it's like, oh, well, that doesn't sound very sure of yourself now.
2513500	2516220	That's a CYA move.
2516220	2520660	Rama says, and also I guarantee that a few people may have lost their jobs over this.
2520660	2523220	You know, and it's always unfortunate for job loss.
2523220	2527500	I just hope the right people lost their jobs over this because if it was the people down
2527500	2530880	in the trenches, that's not who needs to be losing their jobs over it.
2530880	2534580	And you know, I don't want to just go off speculation either.
2534580	2539940	If Sony shook up their management, I want to see the receipts.
2539940	2543180	Going to the chat room with some more comments here.
2543180	2547460	Rama says, Sky, yes, Microsoft got a black eye for the red ring of death, but Microsoft
2547460	2549540	stepped up to the plates and handled it.
2549540	2552620	When people bitched at Nintendo about the Wiimotes, they stepped up.
2552620	2555860	Now that people are bitching to Sony, they turn a blind eye and say, that's not, there's
2555860	2556860	not a problem.
2556860	2558020	Jedi mind trick my ass.
2558020	2559220	Absolutely right.
2559220	2560780	That's my whole point.
2560780	2563260	And that I don't think that press conference yesterday cut it.
2563260	2569020	And I really don't know what is to blame except the management at Sony.
2569020	2573060	It's being a poorly managed company right now.
2573060	2574420	That's that.
2574420	2582180	Let's see, also, some other folks in chat, Defective Candy saying, gah, it wasn't Anon.
2582180	2583540	Bangs her head against the desk.
2583540	2588940	Well, I mean, the only problem Anon has is that because it is the way it is, and I'm
2588940	2594620	not knocking Anon, like, you know, whatever, it's just a subculture of the internet.
2594620	2599360	But the problem with Anon is because it has no face, it's really easy to point the finger
2599360	2600360	at them.
2600360	2604540	It's really easy for Kasarai to get up there and say, well, Anon was in our systems and
2604540	2608820	Anon did this hacking and, you know, we're sending the FBI and the top people on this.
2608820	2611420	We're going to make an example out of some of those Anon kids.
2611420	2613220	Very easy to blame them.
2613220	2615620	Well, good luck.
2615620	2619020	You know, they have yet to find any of these people anyways.
2619020	2621700	And you know, how are they going to prove who did it?
2621700	2622700	I mean, that's tough.
2622700	2624500	That's the best thing about it.
2624500	2628540	That's the smartest thing any type of vigilante group can do on top of that is to be completely
2628540	2629540	decentralized.
2629540	2633540	You know, not know who the other parties are.
2633540	2637020	Dungeon Buster in Artarum says, I don't think that's necessarily related to anything about
2637020	2638340	GeoHots or Anonymous.
2638340	2642140	Sony has a lot of other enemies.
2642140	2646780	Perhaps everything else that was going on with the other companies showed the real person
2646780	2649620	who hacked all this how easy it was to do.
2649620	2654260	Maybe, I still think though, a lot of what happened leading up to this helped whoever
2654260	2655300	did it.
2655300	2658520	We've got an email coming up that's got a pretty interesting suggestion.
2658520	2660660	So I'm going to...
2660660	2661660	Alright.
2661660	2666660	Here's my suggestion though, is all this free stuff you're throwing my way, like free download
2666660	2673580	and free PlayStation Plus and free Curiosity, I don't care about two thirds of that.
2673580	2675940	And the download, I might not even care about that either.
2675940	2684300	So I mean, that's like saying, imagine if you will, Rob, that you went to a restaurant,
2684300	2688180	nice restaurant or whatever, or not even necessarily a nice restaurant.
2688180	2693620	Say you went to Jack in the Box, we'll use Jack in the Box again, and you went there
2693620	2702620	and you bought something and someone stole your credit card information, stole your identity,
2702620	2707140	and you found out, you went to the management and they're like, here's a voucher for a free
2707140	2712220	jumbo jack, sorry.
2712220	2715920	Would that cut it with you?
2715920	2720780	I would be kind of like, really?
2720780	2723820	This is what you're giving me?
2723820	2729060	Here's the thing though, I'm not fully convinced that only Sony is vulnerable to a hack like
2729060	2730060	this.
2730060	2735100	And we've heard of other personal data being compromised on other websites and so forth.
2735100	2742540	So I'm not sure I fully believe that my information is 100% secure with Microsoft, with one of
2742540	2746260	their only services, Steam, with Blizzard.
2746260	2749100	I don't know, but I'm not going to freak out about it.
2749100	2752380	I'm not going to panic and I'm not going to cancel all my credit cards and all that stuff
2752380	2759260	because the money I pay to have a debit or credit card in the first place is supposed
2759260	2762580	to pay to protect me from the fraud.
2762580	2765300	So I'm not that worried about it.
2765300	2769000	And I can thank the PlayStation for being so useless to me that the last time I used
2769000	2773500	my credit card, it had expired that same month, so hahaha!
2773500	2776660	You have old credit card information, good luck spending that money.
2776660	2780140	Dan was saying right before the show though, the one time he finally decided to buy something
2780140	2783620	on PlayStation Network, that was when Moondiver came out, because it's done by the dude that
2783620	2786720	did Strider.
2786720	2789420	Then all this goes down and he's like, well shit.
2789420	2794180	But I mean, other than that, we never really used PlayStation Network, I had zero interest
2794180	2795180	in it.
2795180	2799060	I didn't make a profile until we had our system for two years.
2799060	2802980	If that's any indication, when I was playing Final Fantasy 13.
2802980	2805780	Let me go back to this too in our chatroom, because this is a good point and it came up
2805780	2808860	on my Twitter earlier, but it hasn't come up yet on the show here tonight.
2808860	2812360	Tiger Kong in our chatroom says, you don't have to worry about Nintendo getting hacked,
2812360	2815740	they don't hold any personal info other than friend codes.
2815740	2821140	Well now, despite the shit we've given Nintendo over the years about being so fucking far
2821140	2825100	beyond the times, behind the times when it comes to online stuff, right now, their way
2825100	2828860	of handling credit card payments looks pretty fucking good.
2828860	2829860	In light of all this.
2829860	2834140	I would rather have security than convenience.
2834140	2837420	Just so you know, the Nintendo Wii makes you put in your complete credit card info every
2837420	2838420	time.
2838420	2839420	It doesn't save it.
2839420	2842140	And sometimes it can get a little frustrating, it's like, here I am, putting it in again
2842140	2843140	on the Wiimote.
2843140	2847980	But right now, that system looks pretty darn good.
2847980	2850380	No it doesn't, because, I'm sorry.
2850380	2851380	Once again.
2851380	2853380	Not that I'd actually buy anything on virtual console right now.
2853380	2858380	I don't care, you know, let's praise Nintendo for being lazy.
2858380	2859380	I'm sorry.
2859380	2861220	I'm not saying praise them.
2861220	2866760	I'm just saying, it's ironic how this all kind of works out where Nintendo has really
2866760	2870340	nothing to lose with what happened here.
2870340	2872380	Because of the fact they're so far behind the times.
2872380	2876020	So my only point is that maybe we were moving ahead too fast.
2876020	2880220	We weren't moving ahead too fast, it was just they had poor security, that's all.
2880220	2885020	They thought that, oh, we're big bad Sony, we're just perfect, we're never gonna get
2885020	2886160	hacked.
2886160	2889140	And that was the wrong, first off, that's the wrong thing to go touting.
2889140	2893500	That'd be like saying, hey, good luck trying to break into my house and steal my stuff.
2893500	2896660	I mean, come on, you're just, you're...
2896660	2898960	People are motivated by spite.
2898960	2903260	You know, if you're trying to, people like being competitive.
2903260	2908100	And people like, you know, challenging things that you're giving them, especially a company.
2908100	2911740	They like looking at the company as the evil corporate giant.
2911740	2918100	And if you go and say, well, good luck doing that, rrrr, people are gonna take the David
2918100	2922740	and Goliath route and they're gonna try to bring Goliath down.
2922740	2927660	And you know, for every hundred people that try and fail, someone's gonna do it.
2927660	2930300	So you know how you avoid that?
2930300	2935340	You don't go saying, try to hack me.
2935340	2939020	Being in the chat room at chat.orangehonestrader.com, there's lots of interesting stuff going on
2939020	2940140	in the chat room right now.
2940140	2943980	Let's see, Spaznator in our chat room says, I really didn't expect any freebies.
2943980	2947680	All I'd like is an I'm sorry and assurance that they're learning from their mistakes.
2947680	2948680	Thank you.
2948680	2950620	That would be great, actually.
2950620	2954660	Derek H in our chat says, Sky, that's like saying a horse and carriage looks good after
2954660	2956300	you get into a car accident.
2956300	2961460	You know, it's really funny that you use that as an example because my mom has a true diagnosed
2961460	2964820	fear of driving cars and vehicles and all that.
2964820	2968420	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that, you know, she just didn't like them, whatever,
2968420	2969780	growing up or what have you.
2969780	2973360	And the one time she decided to buck her fear and get behind the wheel of the car after
2973360	2976460	going through the process, getting a license, all that stuff, you know, she finally decides
2976460	2979140	to drive on the freeway for the first time in 20 years.
2979140	2980140	She got sideswiped by a truck.
2980140	2982420	It wasn't even her fault, by the way.
2982420	2983420	It was somebody else.
2983420	2988280	And so now she refuses to drive on the freeway ever and she will only drive the car herself.
2988280	2991820	Like if it's like a do or die scenario.
2991820	2995820	So actually, horse and carriage rides can be very romantic.
2995820	2998580	Well, I actually will say this.
2998580	3004340	I do prefer Nintendo's method of not storing the information because whenever I pay, the
3004340	3010900	only I think online thing ever that has my information saved is my PayPal, which I used
3010900	3016180	to pay for any online service now because I can stop my information from PayPal and
3016180	3022540	the site won't have my information or my WoW subscription.
3022540	3025820	But other than that, nowhere else has my information.
3025820	3029040	Black Wolf in our chat room says, you know, the Battlestar Galactica wasn't affected by
3029040	3033380	the Cylon attack because it didn't use as much future technology as the other Battlestars.
3033380	3034380	Excellent point, Bobby.
3034380	3037900	At least somebody who's on the same wavelength as me.
3037900	3039220	All right.
3039220	3042680	I, yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.
3042680	3044060	You know, that hasn't already been said.
3044060	3048780	I just, where's the, I'm sorry.
3048780	3050380	We'll see what happens.
3050380	3051380	Moving on.
3051380	3055620	I do have another story that's kind of in the same vein as a lot of this stuff, if you
3055620	3056820	will.
3056820	3058980	And what did I say was the root cause of all of this?
3058980	3063220	Sony removing the other OAS feature in the past.
3063220	3067960	And interesting enough, Sony's troubles may not be over as far as that's concerned.
3067960	3071860	They've actually lost what could be a landmark decision in this whole thing.
3071860	3072940	Now here's the deal.
3072940	3078780	It's not as major as it might seem, but it happened in Finland.
3078780	3081100	And it happened by what's called a consumer's board.
3081100	3083620	It is a ruling, but it's a consumer's board.
3083620	3089240	It's not necessarily a government legitimate courtroom ruling, but the consumer's board
3089240	3094860	in Finland has decided that this man who actually took Sony to court, oh, they were removing
3094860	3100260	the other OAS feature, that Sony needs to cough up a hundred euros for doing it.
3100260	3105100	That he should get that because he lost the Linux ability after updating to play a newer
3105100	3107060	game that he bought for the system.
3107060	3109220	Here's a quote from the original article, which is floating around.
3109220	3110980	I'm looking at this off a web forum, so I apologize.
3110980	3113040	I don't know where this came from originally.
3113040	3116420	The man at the center of the case in Finland, which was brought to the consumer complaints
3116420	3120820	board, lost the ability to use an alternative operating system after an update was installed
3120820	3121900	from a new game.
3121900	3126180	He was seeking 150 euros in damages for the removal of the other OAS feature.
3126180	3130980	The CCB said that the removal of other OAS crippled console features that were present
3130980	3134940	at the time of purchase and agreed that consumers should be compensated.
3134940	3138880	It recommended that the manufacturer and seller of the console pay a hundred euros jointly
3138880	3140520	to compensate the man.
3140520	3145280	The CCB does not have the power to enforce the ruling, but the opinion of this board
3145280	3151460	in Finland is considered by the courts in a dispute, meaning if it does go to court,
3151460	3154560	this will weigh heavily on what happens.
3154560	3157820	So, interesting.
3157820	3163180	I guess if Sony truly thought their system, I mean, well this also kind of goes back to
3163180	3164780	Sony being hard-headed.
3164780	3167900	Sony put the other OAS feature in there because they were convinced it could not be used to
3167900	3169380	hack their system because it was unhackable.
3169380	3172980	The minute they found it, oh, it was hackable, oh, they removed it.
3172980	3177020	Well, maybe you shouldn't have put it there in the first place!
3177020	3180900	And still though, it's like saying, you know, oh, well this feature, no one's really using
3180900	3182220	this feature.
3182220	3185820	Okay, it's a feature on something and you remove it.
3185820	3189260	People are going to be pissed because it is, somebody is obviously using it.
3189260	3193060	If no one was using it, why'd you put it there in the first place?
3193060	3195900	I mean, that's like saying, oh, Spanish language?
3195900	3197860	No one uses a Spanish language.
3197860	3202860	I can just speak English or French.
3202860	3203860	So there you go.
3203860	3205540	It'll be interesting to see what develops of that.
3205540	3207500	Sony's troubles may not be over.
3207500	3210940	We're going to be talking about the legal team moving from whatever was going on with
3210940	3215700	Geohotz to now having to deal with class action lawsuits over the downtime.
3215700	3221540	This whole other OS lawsuit and there's a whole other nightmare of problems.
3221540	3224100	I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing in the background right now.
3224100	3225100	That's all I hear.
3225100	3226100	Yeah.
3226100	3228740	Anyhow, Dark Soccer, don't you have something, just something to take my mind off.
3228740	3229980	How about some good news?
3229980	3230980	How about it?
3230980	3233380	How about something for Portal 2?
3233380	3236660	There's going to be a new download content this summer.
3236660	3241580	Valve put out an announcement and it's free, which is great.
3241580	3247260	It'll be called DLC number one and it will have new test chambers, leaderboards, challenge
3247260	3251420	mode for single and multiplayer, quote and more, end quote.
3251420	3258660	It will be on all platforms, Mac, PC, Xbox 360, and maybe PlayStation three, maybe?
3258660	3262940	And uh, it'll be on, yeah, it'll be on PS3.
3262940	3266500	I'm just making a poke, but hey, that's pretty cool.
3266500	3270420	And I so much love the game already that it'd be kind of neat to have some new stuff to
3270420	3271420	do.
3271420	3276620	You gotta admit though, every developer, every single one of them who makes money off DLC,
3276620	3281140	who makes money off designing games specifically for the Xbox live arcade and PlayStation network
3281140	3285820	platforms has got to be looking at what's going on right now, 11 days of lost sales.
3285820	3286820	This is free.
3286820	3290620	I know this is free, but I just, it just reminds me of that whole thing and that's why I'm
3290620	3294340	saying the impact on the whole digital distribution thing will be felt.
3294340	3296900	Anyhow, I like free things though.
3296900	3300900	I hope part, I hope we do get more maps and things that let this game live on.
3300900	3301900	It'd be great.
3301900	3305540	And I think it's a good value as it is, but just if they enhance that value, especially
3305540	3308860	if they have like a map editor for people, Oh my gosh.
3308860	3312060	I think that's one of the things I was hearing about going to be coming out actually is that
3312060	3316260	they're because that was always been kind of cool though.
3316260	3318220	Like, you know what Gary's mod is, right?
3318220	3322400	You know, the modding community is really big out there and they've, you know, paid,
3322400	3324580	you know, to put some development into some of this.
3324580	3328500	So they're seeing people doing the same thing with portal and are encouraging it.
3328500	3332620	And I think they're supposed to have, I remembered hearing something about them having some sort
3332620	3336100	of level sharing coming out.
3336100	3337980	There was some fan wank discussion last night.
3337980	3341360	I want to say it was one when I was on wow about talking about how awesome it would be
3341360	3344100	if like there was a Tron themed portal level or something like that.
3344100	3347680	And I'm like, that fan wank could be a reality if they do release some of these like map
3347680	3349300	editors and things, somebody will be on that.
3349300	3350300	You know it.
3350300	3353900	It's ironic, but the orange and blue would fit very well with the Tron universe.
3353900	3354900	Wouldn't it?
3354900	3360500	So yeah, and considering, yeah, actually it would.
3360500	3365980	Can you imagine like a death match portal type thing or like four player portal or something
3365980	3368660	that we just death match portal?
3368660	3369660	I don't know.
3369660	3371780	I, I don't know.
3371780	3376300	There's I, there's part of me that wants to say no, they should think about the more competitive
3376300	3380160	stuff when portal three comes out and there's a part of me that says actually portal three
3380160	3382080	should probably never come out.
3382080	3385460	I don't think there should be a portal three.
3385460	3390300	You know, maybe it's like one of those movies that really doesn't need a sequel.
3390300	3395580	I don't see at all possible how there could be a portal three where there's money to be
3395580	3396580	made.
3396580	3401540	There's always, they're saying though that for, um, half life three that what's your
3401540	3403740	face tell is supposed to be in half life three.
3403740	3404740	Yeah.
3404740	3409220	Speaking of like valve and things that end in three, I'm not so sure that's a possibility
3409220	3411740	with house actually.
3411740	3419460	Have they ever gotten to three in their series three episode three is supposed to be episode
3419460	3420460	three is a myth.
3420460	3421460	Okay.
3421460	3422460	Yeah.
3422460	3423460	Let's see.
3423460	3424460	Left for dead.
3424460	3425460	Well, the first two came out real quick.
3425460	3426460	Then there was never a third one portal.
3426460	3427460	Well, we'll see.
3427460	3428940	And yeah, no, I don't know.
3428940	3431420	Did they ever get to three?
3431420	3432940	I'm not saying this necessarily a bad thing.
3432940	3436100	I'm just, you know, well, let's put it this way.
3436100	3440380	We haven't heard of any new games from valve yet and I can imagine that there's a certain
3440380	3442500	E3 convention around the corner.
3442500	3448980	So I'm sure with, you know, nothing really on the slate from valve, there's lots to possibly
3448980	3449980	announce.
3449980	3450980	Yeah.
3450980	3454580	This could finally be where they do drop the bombshell about half life episode three, but
3454580	3455580	I don't know.
3455580	3458700	Or left for dead threes with a portal gun in there.
3458700	3460220	Or maybe something new.
3460220	3463340	I mean, I kind of trust valve with new ideas right now.
3463340	3465280	You know, they've had a lot of good stuff.
3465280	3469540	Like left for dead, great game, often copied portal.
3469540	3470540	Excellent little thing.
3470540	3473380	I mean, I'm, I'm all for whatever they come out with next.
3473380	3476940	I believe one of the things they have on the horizon is their whole, uh, defense of the
3476940	3477940	ancients.
3477940	3478940	Dota.
3478940	3479940	He's called Dota two.
3479940	3480940	Yeah.
3480940	3486660	They have an official Dota thing coming out, which was originally a Warcraft three mod,
3486660	3488260	but they hired the people that made it.
3488260	3490100	It's not the same thing as league of legends.
3490100	3493540	In fact, legal legends is kind of, it's this whole, the defense of the ancients thing has
3493540	3497080	gone a million different ways because blizzard has their own thing coming to starcraft legal
3497080	3500220	legends is out there too, by, I believe some of the people that were involved with Dota
3500220	3501220	in the beginning.
3501220	3505420	And then the people that got hired from valve for Dota have the official Dota two game
3505420	3506420	coming out.
3506420	3508260	And I think that's probably what you're going to see.
3508260	3513860	Most of it E3 this year out of valve, anyhow, free stuff.
3513860	3514860	Yeah.
3514860	3515860	Free stuff is good.
3515860	3519660	And I'm all for continuing to expand the terrific game that is portal two, but I would honestly
3519660	3522700	be still be happy with my purchase if they never expanded it.
3522700	3524740	But I think I'm still having fun.
3524740	3525740	Oh yeah, absolutely.
3525740	3528180	I just think it's a great value.
3528180	3531540	Anyhow, Loki, let's move on.
3531540	3533100	Ah, yes.
3533100	3539700	And the, the other big story that was floating around the web of course is the off rumored
3539700	3543220	a sequel console for the, we obviously, I mean, there's going to be a new console from
3543220	3544820	Nintendo at some point.
3544820	3550180	Um, now Nintendo has officially announced that yes, they will be talking about a successor
3550180	3556460	to the Wii, not necessarily a Wii two, but a, another console coming, um, for 2012.
3556460	3562220	And of course, um, you know, they're saying, uh, you know, it's going to be shown off at
3562220	3563220	E3.
3563220	3568580	It's going to be playable E3, um, probably if you're pressing behind doors, but you know,
3568580	3569900	it will be playable.
3569900	3570900	It'll be there.
3570900	3572660	Thing that has the Uber long line to play.
3572660	3573660	Yes.
3573660	3579900	That's been Nintendo's E3 motif for years, uh, minus the airport, of course, tons of
3579900	3584060	rumors about what it is and project cafe and all that fun stuff.
3584060	3587700	And just so you know, last week we talked at length about this cause a lot of the rumors
3587700	3588700	had come out.
3588700	3592620	Now we have the confirmation Nintendo saying, okay, yes, it's happening and we'll see you
3592620	3593620	at E3.
3593620	3595420	That's, that's the news from this week.
3595420	3598260	Last week we talked at length about a lot of stuff, just so you know, which by the way
3598260	3605220	would include when I in January on this program said, Nintendo is showing a new console at
3605220	3608060	E3 this year because they've got nothing going for them on the Wii right now, but that new
3608060	3613820	Zelda game and you, Loki, said, no, no, they're not going to show, no, the Wii still prints
3613820	3614820	money.
3614820	3616300	They're not going to show a new console at E3.
3616300	3619900	So I just wanted to say, thank you.
3619900	3620900	Okay.
3620900	3625780	Um, but you're still wrong with them not having anything coming out on the Wii.
3625780	3627420	What's going to come out on the Wii?
3627420	3628420	Let's see.
3628420	3630100	They've already got two games that they have coming out in June.
3630100	3635900	Wii Play Motion and Mystery Case Files, which was previously Dust Dust.
3635900	3640540	And then they also have their Zelda game coming out, which yes, I can probably see them doing
3640540	3644660	another Twilight Princess, oh, it's meant for the Wii, but we're going to port it over
3644660	3648100	to the new system because, uh, well actually, you know what, I don't know if they would
3648100	3652020	do that because if it's coming out at the end of 2012, then I don't think that they
3652020	3653020	would delay it that long.
3653020	3654020	They need something for Christmas this year.
3654020	3659360	If the system isn't coming out until 2012, uh, you know, and to be fair, I had speculated
3659360	3661020	like why are they waiting until 2012?
3661020	3663040	But I guess they did the same thing with the 3DS.
3663040	3666300	They do need something this year.
3666300	3671260	And I actually think you calling the new Super Mario Brothers sequel, I think is a distinct
3671260	3675220	possibility for the rabbit out of their hat for the Wii this year.
3675220	3678860	Let's, yeah, I know you guys talked about this last week, but I wasn't here, so I'm
3678860	3680140	just going to get my take on a lot of stuff.
3680140	3683940	And you love Nintendo more than anyone on this show, so definitely want to know your
3683940	3684940	opinion.
3684940	3689500	Listen, okay, we've got to think like Nintendo here and why they're doing what they're doing.
3689500	3692220	Here's how it's going to all work, I think.
3692220	3695860	Okay, let's take the name Project Cafe.
3695860	3696860	What is a cafe?
3696860	3699700	A cafe is a place that you go gather with your friends.
3699700	3705020	It's a very casual meeting place, lots of, you know, chatting and interactivity and that
3705020	3706020	kind of stuff.
3706020	3711820	So maybe now the focus is going to be, and you know, that'd be great if they actually
3711820	3718140	did more like online kind of think of like Facebook stuff, you know, where you're sharing
3718140	3721620	stuff with your friends, you're, you know, conversing.
3721620	3728420	It's very casual, I don't know, lots of online content, we'd hope.
3728420	3734180	Sorry, I have to say S2100 Matt in the chatroom says, Rob, the Christmas hot seller is the
3734180	3736500	Vitality sensor.
3736500	3741220	I guarantee you the Vitality sensor is dead, it's been swept under the rug.
3741220	3746540	However, you may see it rear its little ugly head on whatever, like, you know, just a little
3746540	3749660	piece of metal on the back of some controller.
3749660	3751820	Nintendo will never fully scrap an idea.
3751820	3756780	It will rear its ugly head again at some point, but as far as the Wii Vitality sensor, no.
3756780	3758300	It got laughed out of submission.
3758300	3764820	Alright, so anyways, so you may see something like that, but this is Nintendo we're talking
3764820	3767980	about here, so I don't know if they're actually going to do that.
3767980	3773460	I would hope that, you know, now being that this is the next generation of consoles, they
3773460	3779100	would understand that yes, okay, online gaming is something that people do want, you know,
3779100	3785820	social, you know, community features, something that people do like having, because Facebook
3785820	3790780	is popular, all this stuff's popular, let's bring it in, okay, so let's assume that they're
3790780	3791780	going to do that.
3791780	3794620	Oh God, that's why the controllers are all touch screens, because they're going to want
3794620	3797780	you to take them out in public, just like the 3DS, they're going to want you to take
3797780	3802460	those things with you wherever you go, so that when you meet people, you can, like,
3802460	3804900	do the game data trades, just like the 3DS.
3804900	3807540	No, I don't think they're going to be doing that.
3807540	3808540	Really?
3808540	3812900	And here's, here's, okay, first off, they're not going to have a controller like, well,
3812900	3817940	they're going to have, they may have a controller with a six, I have a hard time believing that
3817940	3820540	there's going to be a six-inch touch screen on a controller, because that's going to be
3820540	3821980	fucking expensive.
3821980	3825620	Just so you know the kind of level where I speculated last week, I said if it's true,
3825620	3829180	if it's even true, because, you know, all the people kind of come out of the woodwork
3829180	3832620	about, you know, these speculations and so forth, if it's true, you know, at one point
3832620	3837220	the Wii was supposed to project 3D imagery on the wall, remember that, but here's the
3837220	3840860	thing, if it's true about these touch screens, I think it's like a, like the printers, like,
3840860	3844340	you know how there's a lot of $300 printers out there where you can take the screen off
3844340	3847620	and, like, digitally manipulate your photos on the screen and then print them from that,
3847620	3851620	and they're kind of like a low-quality screen, but they are full-color and they look alright?
3851620	3854540	I think it's that, but, like, a fucking iPad is a controller?
3854540	3855540	No.
3855540	3857260	No, it's, it's not anything like that.
3857260	3861700	If anything, I would see maybe it's some sort, because you have to also understand, Nintendo's
3861700	3863280	not going to compete with themselves.
3863280	3866140	Why would they release something that could be used as, like, a portable gaming device
3866140	3868980	when they have a portable gaming device that doesn't make any sense?
3868980	3873300	If anything, they'd want you to use your 3DS or something like that for some sort of connectivity,
3873300	3875820	but whatever, okay?
3875820	3878300	And then the other thing, too, is the cost of this thing, I mean, if this controller's
3878300	3882580	like $100, people are like, fuck that, I ain't buying a $100 controller.
3882580	3884580	I think the 3DS will stand in as a controller.
3884580	3887020	I think that's how they don't bite themselves in the foot.
3887020	3889380	It's a controller that will also do the 3D display.
3889380	3895100	Okay, so let's just assume, okay, let's say that, I mean, don't get me wrong, they could
3895100	3898900	come up with some really low quality screen that could, I mean, look at the PlayStation
3898900	3903580	1 low monitors that were $50 or whatever, I mean, you put a touchscreen display on top
3903580	3907380	of there, a touch panel display, you could, you know, kind of jerry-rig something like
3907380	3908380	that.
3908380	3915900	So, anyways, so let's say they, that's going to happen, that'd be interesting, I guess,
3915900	3920220	but they're also saying that they're still going to keep the original controls as well,
3920220	3925500	because, like I'm expecting, this system's probably just going to upscale these old Wii
3925500	3926500	games.
3926500	3930700	So you know how you see all this emulator footage with 1080p, new Super Mario Bros.
3930700	3933900	and stuff like that, and how it looks really pretty?
3933900	3934940	There you go!
3934940	3939900	Your games are brand new again, and we can still sell Wii games, you know.
3939900	3942460	I think they're even going to take one of two approaches.
3942460	3945620	They're either going to try to get everybody to go up onto this new platform, or they're
3945620	3947940	going to try to keep this platform along with the Wii.
3947940	3950820	You know, you have the Wii for the casual people that don't want to spend a lot of money
3950820	3954460	on stuff, and then you have this new system for the hardcore players that really want,
3954460	3956700	you know, something that has the graphics and all that.
3956700	3957700	But guess what, though?
3957700	3960620	If you have those Wii games that you want to buy, they look really pretty on your new
3960620	3965020	HD platform or something like that.
3965020	3970340	But all I gotta say is- I think you are on the money on this.
3970340	3971340	I really do.
3971340	3974940	I hate saying when you're, I think when you talk about this, and yeah, and it's funny
3974940	3979620	because somebody in chat, who said this in chat, said, Amiga777 in chat said, please
3979620	3985460	no illusions, the dolphin GameCube had next to nothing to do with water.
3985460	3989740	But I honestly think, like, what's the one place where everybody always razzes Nintendo
3989740	3991900	online?
3991900	3993880	What does Nintendo want a piece of?
3993880	3995880	What everybody's into.
3995880	3998460	That's what the Wii was all about, was trying to get everybody into gaming.
3998460	4002880	Don't think they don't look at Facebook and say, hmm, how could we get a part of this?
4002880	4008340	I just hope- This is the Facebook- But I just really hope that they don't try to do some
4008340	4013500	stupid gimmick with this touchscreen thing, because honestly I don't need another fucking
4013500	4014500	gimmick from Nintendo.
4014500	4018940	I mean, let's just stop- Nintendo is a fucking lazy company.
4018940	4019940	I'm sorry.
4019940	4022020	They are a fucking lazy company, and you know why?
4022020	4026240	Because they will take the least amount of effort to put out a new game.
4026240	4031260	I mean, they're porting old shit for the 3DS, okay great, you're updating stuff.
4031260	4032960	Why don't you create a damn new game?
4032960	4035020	You can do it in the same style as the old game.
4035020	4039940	You know, you did the same thing with, like, you know, the Wind Waker looking stuff on,
4039940	4044180	you know, the DS, or I guess Wind Waker, yeah.
4044180	4050060	So you did it, like, on the DS, but, you know, why can't you just create new games that look
4050060	4051060	like the old games?
4051060	4054540	Why do you have to port the old games over?
4054540	4058060	It's because you don't want- You want to spend the least amount of time possible working
4058060	4062160	on this shit, because people will buy it no matter what you put out.
4062160	4064780	So what's the least possible effort that they can put in a new console?
4064780	4065980	Oh, I don't know!
4065980	4068280	Something that takes the old games and makes them look new.
4068280	4069960	That's what you're gonna do.
4069960	4073820	And then they can put out new games that look even nicer if they want, but at the same time,
4073820	4076860	they don't have to do that much because they can just put out these low-quality games and
4076860	4078380	they upscale everything and it looks pretty.
4078380	4082140	Yeah, but I don't think- But I don't- This is not gonna be Wii 2.
4082140	4085320	It's absolutely not gonna just be the Wii with enhanced graphics.
4085320	4086320	Absolutely not.
4086320	4087320	I mean, there's a whole little follow-up-
4087320	4089300	But if it was, they should call it the Wii Wii.
4089300	4092580	There's a follow-up article to this where they actually said they came out and said-
4092580	4093580	What is this?
4093580	4097680	Satoru Iwata comes out and says, quote, we would like to propose a new approach to home
4097680	4099180	video game consoles.
4099180	4100180	Please.
4100180	4101180	Okay.
4101180	4104380	A new approach to home video game consoles.
4104380	4106460	So with the Wii- Is the Facebook thing.
4106460	4107460	Yes.
4107460	4111180	So with the Wii- But not actual Facebook, Nintendo book.
4111180	4115740	With the Wii, they were trying to get people that were getting non-game players to play
4115740	4116900	this console.
4116900	4121340	So were they gonna try to- It's kinda hard though, because now, what are they gonna try
4121340	4128660	to bring- Oh my god, this would be- This would be hilarious, because it'd be basically eating
4128660	4129660	their own words.
4129660	4133140	Wouldn't it be funny if they just like came out with something that's very similar to
4133140	4136940	like the iOS marketplace or something like that, really cheap-ass games, and this whole
4136940	4138220	like iPad type thing?
4138220	4139220	DSiWare?
4139220	4143500	Well, no, I understand that they have DSiWare, but you know, I'm saying to the point where
4143500	4147340	it's, you know, more than three releases a week or something like that.
4147340	4150140	You know, just something ridiculous and very casual games.
4150140	4154620	I'd laugh my ass off because, you know- Oh, Apple, they're stupid, you know.
4154620	4156300	Oh, then we're gonna copy them!
4156300	4158340	I don't know.
4158340	4162980	I can't really pass judgment on it yet until we actually see what it is, but I, you know-
4162980	4164460	Let me put it this way.
4164460	4169620	If it's anything like the other Nintendo promises and stuff that we've seen, a lot of it is
4169620	4170620	really eye roll-worthy.
4170620	4173000	I mean, seriously, remember the Wii Zapper?
4173000	4177500	I mean, I go back to the Wii Zapper, you know, when they first showed it off, the prototype,
4177500	4178500	it looked fucking badass.
4178500	4183300	It was like, oh yeah, dude, that's the Zapper right there, and then when they came out with
4183300	4188260	this plastic shell Zapper that looked like shit, it was like, what?
4188260	4189260	Really?
4189260	4192900	That's your controller?
4192900	4196840	And speaking of which, when did we- are we ever gonna get any other controllers that
4196840	4199580	plug into the bottom of the goddamn Wii remote?
4199580	4202000	Because we have the nudge- No, you're not.
4202000	4205180	Because they're on a new console now, so the answer is no, Loki.
4205180	4206180	You're not.
4206180	4207180	I can answer that for you.
4207180	4208180	All these promises.
4208180	4209180	You're welcome.
4209180	4210500	Just never following through.
4210500	4214260	Let me ask you this, because obviously you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics, it's why
4214260	4217100	people love you or hate you.
4217100	4219300	But yet you own a 3DS and you've owned multiple 3DSs.
4219300	4221620	Yeah, but I don't play it, and I don't even know why I own it.
4221620	4222820	I'm not razzing you on it.
4222820	4230340	My true question for you is, what could Nintendo do at E3 with this console to make you go,
4230340	4233380	okay, Nintendo, I misjudged you.
4233380	4235140	You're on the right track again.
4235140	4236560	Get with the times.
4236560	4237700	That's what I'm saying.
4237700	4238700	That's what they need to do.
4238700	4242660	They need to take themselves seriously, because if they try to pull out another system that's
4242660	4247380	just another gimmick, you know, another gimmicky system, and I'm sorry, the 3DS is kind of
4247380	4248380	a gimmicky system.
4248380	4253500	I bought into the gimmick, because all it is is a fucking DS with 3D gameplay, a little
4253500	4254500	bit better graphics.
4254500	4255500	But that's it.
4255500	4259500	I mean, they're not really, I mean, whoopty shit.
4259500	4260760	It has tilt controls on it.
4260760	4266740	I don't want tilt controls, but whatever, you know, that's part of it.
4266740	4272940	But I mean, if they're just, if, I need something a little bit more than just, oh look, new
4272940	4273940	Mario game.
4273940	4275100	Oh look, another Mario Kart.
4275100	4278460	Oh look, another Zelda game.
4278460	4280020	Maybe make a new franchise.
4280020	4284260	You know, you've been dealing with these old franchises for a long ass time.
4284260	4290420	How about creating the next good franchise, or maybe just, I don't know, putting a little
4290420	4294580	bit more effort into something, because if we put out another Zelda game, you know, or
4294580	4298980	if they take Twilight Princess and like make it look even prettier or something like that,
4298980	4302740	or like that one Zelda game that they were showing off that was Twilight Princess at
4302740	4306820	one point, and then they ended up, you know, scrapping that kind of look for the game because
4306820	4309820	it's a dark, you know, Zelda game or something.
4309820	4310820	I don't know.
4310820	4315860	Maybe a little bit more than just Nintendo games and better graphics.
4315860	4320740	I mean, I don't know.
4320740	4322860	I would just, I want to see what they're offering.
4322860	4324900	That's really, I guess we'll have to wait and see.
4324900	4330100	But I'm sorry, I know for a fact that I'm going to be laughing my ass off during this
4330100	4331100	press conference.
4331100	4337740	You know, it's just going to be, because they have these really wacky ideas of what people
4337740	4342420	want, but apparently it works for them, so you know, I'm not going to fault them for
4342420	4347780	it, but you know, at the same time, there's consoles out there that I'm playing way more
4347780	4348780	than Wii.
4348780	4351860	Although, to be fair, my wife has gotten back to playing the Wii.
4351860	4355860	I did break my Wii for a little bit, though, and I had to fix it by swapping out the motherboard,
4355860	4360860	but you know, and then we got back into playing some of the old Wii games that we liked, like
4360860	4366340	Excite Truck, which Nintendo, for the love of God, just make another damn Excite Truck
4366340	4371540	game, do not make Excite Bots, just another Excite Truck game with more tracks.
4371540	4372540	That'd make me happy.
4372540	4374980	How about a new F-Zero?
4374980	4376740	That's what I asked for on last week's show.
4376740	4377740	Eh, whatever.
4377740	4379020	Uh, play Speed Racer.
4379020	4380020	It's pretty much F-Zero.
4380020	4384980	Um, no but seriously, they just need to do that.
4384980	4388220	Just make, yeah, perfect example right there.
4388220	4389220	Excite Truck.
4389220	4394420	Launch Wii title, use some of the features of the Wii that like, you know, like, oh SD
4394420	4395420	memory cards.
4395420	4397660	You can play your own music off the SD memory card.
4397660	4398740	That's really awesome.
4398740	4402580	It made that game so much more awesome, because you can listen to your music while you're
4402580	4405100	driving in this really awesome racing game.
4405100	4406100	Sequel comes out.
4406100	4407100	What do they do?
4407100	4408100	Oh, guess what?
4408100	4409580	We need more mini games in there.
4409580	4411700	Mini games do not belong in a fucking racing game.
4411700	4416440	Oh, and then we take out the whole, you know, music playing feature, because no one really
4416440	4418020	used that.
4418020	4420220	Thanks, Nintendo Sony.
4420220	4425820	Um, and then also they just add a couple extra tracks, but seriously, throwing a pie at a
4425820	4428220	clown's face should never be in a racing game.
4428220	4430700	Bullying should never be in a racing game.
4430700	4433340	Throwing darts should never be in a racing game.
4433340	4436420	Making a sandwich should never be in a racing game.
4436420	4437420	Ever.
4437420	4442420	I get that it's wacky and stuff, but it's not fucking Excite Truck.
4442420	4444740	So that's what Nintendo needs to do to make you happy is stop making sandwiches.
4444740	4448300	They need to treat us like adults instead of just little, little kids.
4448300	4449300	Get it.
4449300	4450300	People.
4450300	4451300	Yeah, I get it.
4451300	4454220	People like the party games on the Wii, because, you know, Wii is kind of a social game, but
4454220	4458260	you don't need to make every goddamn game a party game, and you also don't need to make
4458260	4460580	every damn game a family game.
4460580	4463500	What about this comment from Forbes 1-1-1 in our chat, Loki?
4463500	4465140	Again, they don't care about what you want.
4465140	4466140	It's about the money.
4466140	4467140	I retorted.
4467140	4469380	If they want the money, they need to care about what we want.
4469380	4472740	Well, how well did Excite Truck sell?
4472740	4473740	Not very well.
4473740	4476660	Maybe that's why they didn't give you more of that.
4476660	4479180	Because they didn't advertise damn game.
4479180	4483260	It was an awesome game, and it's really underrated, and I'm really sad that they...
4483260	4484260	But here's the thing.
4484260	4485500	Yeah, you're right.
4485500	4490340	You don't have to do what I want, but I don't have to buy your console either.
4490340	4491340	And you know what?
4491340	4495740	As consoles get more expensive, and money gets tighter, I won't be buying every console
4495740	4497140	that you put out.
4497140	4500620	And yeah, the 3DS was pretty much an impulse buy, and you know what?
4500620	4505160	Kind of have some buyer's remorse over it, because there weren't any...
4505160	4508140	There weren't any really must-have games at launch, and you know what?
4508140	4511500	There aren't really any must-have games in the next portion of the year.
4511500	4513260	And yeah, I know Zelda's coming out.
4513260	4517140	But as I've said before, Ocarina of Time is the most overrated fucking game on the Nintendo
4517140	4518140	system ever.
4518140	4519140	Agreed.
4519140	4520140	So you know what?
4520140	4524620	I'm not buying Ocarina of Time, so what's that leave me with?
4524620	4525620	Fucking nothing!
4525620	4526620	Because there's nothing coming out!
4526620	4527620	So...
4527620	4528620	Kid Icarus.
4528620	4529620	Yeah, Kid Icarus.
4529620	4530620	Oh, great!
4530620	4533800	Well, then I'll enjoy my three games for the next nine months, or whatever it's gonna take
4533800	4536020	for Kid Icarus to come out.
4536020	4537020	So that's it.
4537020	4538260	You know, we'll see what they...
4538260	4540180	Netflix 3DS, that's what I'm looking forward to.
4540180	4543900	We'll see what they bring to the table, you know, at E3.
4543900	4547420	But just remember this, you know, and another thing.
4547420	4550060	Here's the other thing that'll make me happy, Nintendo.
4550060	4552780	When you release your console, and you're talking about the features that are gonna
4552780	4558060	be on your console, they better not be coming in an update that's five months, three months,
4558060	4560540	one month, one day after the console's release.
4560540	4562180	It better be at fucking launch.
4562180	4564100	It's like a stupid 3DS.
4564100	4565260	Oh, it has a web browser!
4565260	4566660	Oh, a feature coming later.
4566660	4567660	Sorry.
4567660	4571640	All right, let me move on to something else.
4571640	4573020	Let's talk about something very serious here.
4573020	4576780	I want to talk about Beyonce for a minute.
4576780	4577780	That's serious.
4577780	4579820	This is very serious.
4579820	4584940	Beyonce is being sued because, God, we love lawsuits this week.
4584940	4586620	That's what we seem to be reporting on.
4586620	4590140	Beyonce got sued for $100 million!
4590140	4591260	She probably has it.
4591260	4594620	Beyonce, even though her new single is terrible, just saying.
4594620	4598540	But Beyonce has been sued for $100 million from Gate 5.
4598540	4599540	Why is she being sued?
4599540	4605260	Well, it's because the singer made this huge demand for more money during a crucial moment
4605260	4609660	in the production of a game called Star Power Beyonce.
4609660	4610660	That's right.
4610660	4612180	They were making a game called Star Power Beyonce.
4612180	4613940	I have no idea what this game would have been.
4613940	4617420	I imagine it must be like the Michael Jackson experience or something.
4617420	4618420	I don't know.
4618420	4619420	She stars out of her cooch.
4619420	4623380	A music game that involves Beyonce, where you could do the single ladies dance in the
4623380	4624820	privacy of your own home.
4624820	4626260	Put your hands up.
4626260	4633140	Anyhow, Gate 5 says, we are entitled to the $6.7 million that we invested and the $100
4633140	4636040	million in profits that we would have made.
4636040	4642660	They had to let 70 employees go right at the Christmas season because of what Beyonce did.
4642660	4645140	What a Grinch.
4645140	4650980	And they want an injunction against Beyonce from commercially associating with any other
4650980	4657060	video game or using confidential information that she got when she was working with the
4657060	4659060	company.
4659060	4663420	Isn't it ironic that she was in a commercial for the DS as well, I think, mid last year.
4663420	4664920	It was the year before.
4664920	4669360	Like she's actually going to retain any confidential information gained from a video game company.
4669360	4670360	Like she remembered anything.
4670360	4671360	That information was like poof.
4671360	4672860	It just evaporated out of her head.
4672860	4673860	Oh, yeah.
4673860	4674860	That was real cool.
4674860	4675860	You guys looks real cool.
4675860	4676860	But how much you pay me?
4676860	4679620	Seriously, she picked up nothing.
4679620	4680900	Yeah.
4680900	4682020	Maybe her people did.
4682020	4683020	Her entourage.
4683020	4684020	I don't know.
4684020	4685020	Yeah.
4685020	4686220	I think Jay-Z sat with her in those meetings.
4686220	4687220	I'm sorry.
4687220	4691380	We now have a discussion going about people buying Beyonce cootch stars.
4691380	4693780	I said I would rather buy Gaga cootch stars.
4693780	4695060	I wouldn't buy.
4695060	4696660	How about all cootch stars?
4696660	4698460	Just get all the crazy ladies.
4698460	4699940	A Beyonce game sounds dumb.
4699940	4700940	I'm sorry.
4700940	4702940	It would have made money.
4702940	4706020	It wouldn't be like the biggest video game ever, but it would have made money.
4706020	4711020	A hundred million dollars, I mean, that's way more than if they were going to spend
4711020	4713980	a hundred million dollars or they spent a hundred million dollars in this game.
4713980	4716140	No, they think a hundred million is what they lost.
4716140	4717140	They lost.
4717140	4718140	Oh, come on.
4718140	4719140	They would have never.
4719140	4722140	They would have never made a hundred million dollars on this game.
4722140	4723940	That would require them selling.
4723940	4727060	Let's just say it's a fifty dollar retail game.
4727060	4729680	And let's just say that it's all pure profit.
4729680	4731900	I mean, because this is never going to.
4731900	4733580	I mean, it would be way more than that.
4733580	4737300	They would have to sell more than two million copies of this game to make their money back,
4737300	4742100	assuming that they were getting all of the money from the actual game sale, which they're
4742100	4743100	not.
4743100	4746200	So, you know, they're saying that this game would have sold over two million copies.
4746200	4747900	It would have not sold over two million copies.
4747900	4752600	It would have sold two hundred thousand copies at the most.
4752600	4754580	So they would have had to fire people anyway.
4754580	4757580	So who cares?
4757580	4764940	Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news, and then we're going to get to
4764940	4767180	the release dates here in a little bit.
4767180	4772180	Trying to keep the show moving right along with what was a pretty hefty news week.
4772180	4774680	And I know there's going to be lots of phone calls tonight, so I want to keep some time
4774680	4775680	open in Part B.
4775680	4776680	So it's my turn?
4776680	4777680	That's right.
4777680	4778680	It's your turn.
4778680	4779680	Tron!
4779680	4781540	But you have to do the single ladies dance.
4781540	4782540	No.
4782540	4783540	Alright.
4783540	4784540	Tron.
4784540	4786940	Guess what about Tron?
4786940	4787940	Pinball!
4787940	4790660	Ooh, happy, happy, happy, happy.
4790660	4796300	Yeah, I showed this to Dan, and he's like, what pinball tables can we get rid of to get
4796300	4797300	this?
4797300	4798300	I was actually thinking that.
4798300	4801460	I was like, which pinball tables are you going to sell to buy the Tron pinball?
4801460	4806100	Well, actually, three of our tables would equal the cost of this, which is the problem.
4806100	4807100	It's going to be expensive.
4807100	4808100	You know what?
4808100	4809100	I think you should do it.
4809100	4812220	If it were my choice, I'd get rid of Lord of the Rings, but Dan loves that table.
4812220	4813220	So, anyway.
4813220	4818700	Now, Stern, which is like the only company doing tables anymore, is putting out Tron.
4818700	4822260	And instead of doing just their usual teaser of the cabinet art, they've actually got the
4822260	4830580	whole play field out, which I'm going to go ahead and link an image in the chat room for
4830580	4831580	them to look at.
4831580	4834540	But the pictures are up at arcadeheroes.com.
4834540	4836740	It's actually looking really good.
4836740	4842900	It's got 3D models in there, the light cycles, little figures in the back.
4842900	4843900	Plenty of ramps.
4843900	4845400	Plenty of lights.
4845400	4853260	And they're actually talking about doing a potentially limited edition where they might
4853260	4860260	have something other than just those monochrome LED backgrounds.
4860260	4864860	But that's still kind of speculation.
4864860	4865860	It's pretty cool.
4865860	4869860	But the back glass is supposed to have the 3D parallax effect that's the same on the
4869860	4871460	Avatar pinball.
4871460	4876620	So it's going to be out sometime this month with a limited edition in June.
4876620	4878020	And it looks sick.
4878020	4881700	And hopefully California Extreme will have one for us to play.
4881700	4884260	They had Iron Man last year.
4884260	4888860	And on top of that, one of the other tables that Stern's doing, by the way, is the Rolling
4888860	4889860	Stones.
4889860	4890860	But it's like a $6,000 table.
4890860	4891940	So how much is that table?
4891940	4892940	This one's going to be about $4,000.
4892940	4893940	$4,500.
4893940	4894940	Something like that.
4894940	4895940	That's not bad.
4895940	4896940	Jeez.
4896940	4897940	Well, you know, Stern printed it.
4897940	4902700	This is the problem I have with this is that now that we don't have Williams and Midway
4902700	4907780	doing tables anymore and Capcom is out of the game, Stern's really the only company
4907780	4908780	there is.
4908780	4910740	They can charge what they want.
4910740	4918060	They have the Williams collection coming out on the 3DS in June, I think.
4918060	4919060	That's kind of cool.
4919060	4921060	I've got the Williams tables, I will.
4921060	4925900	Yeah, that game has been re-released so many damn times by Crave.
4925900	4930380	I thought Crave closed down, but yeah, they're still making games.
4930380	4931380	Porting games.
4931380	4932380	I don't know.
4932380	4940100	Oh, I, you know, and this is my thing, as much as I love video pinball, nothing compares
4940100	4942480	to the real thing.
4942480	4946980	So I would almost always go out and hunt down a good pinball table than have...
4946980	4950180	So you wouldn't be interested in like a pin maim table?
4950180	4951260	Like an actual, you know...
4951260	4952260	I played a pin maim.
4952260	4953780	And you know what?
4953780	4956500	It was fun, but not my thing.
4956500	4961940	It was, I mean, and I'll tell you what I did because a few years ago they had one at California
4961940	4965860	Extreme and right next to it was Black Knight 2000.
4965860	4969860	And I played Black Knight 2000 on the pin maim and then I played Black Knight 2000 on
4969860	4972620	the real thing and it's just...
4972620	4976580	You just can't get the same feel.
4976580	4978260	It's a very good simulacrum.
4978260	4985060	I mean, pin maim itself is very well done, but it's just not the same.
4985060	4986060	I want to go ahead.
4986060	4989540	I don't, I can't remember very often in the history of our show that we do this, but there
4989540	4994580	is a real world that goes on out there outside of us and not just what's happening in the
4994580	4995580	world of video games.
4995580	4999180	And if you are all about 100% video games, I do encourage you to go outside once in a
4999180	5000180	while.
5000180	5001900	But needless to say, there's a lot going on in the real world right now.
5001900	5006820	They are saying that President Obama is scheduled to address the nation any minute now.
5006820	5011020	I guess it's supposed to happen at 1030 Eastern, but it's running a little late.
5011020	5013260	I take this with a grain of salt.
5013260	5014260	We'll find out in the next few minutes.
5014260	5017380	I'm looking at what is usually a pretty respectable source.
5017380	5022300	It does sound like Osama bin Laden is dead and the US has the body and that's what Obama
5022300	5024380	is expected to announce the next few minutes.
5024380	5025380	I hope.
5025380	5027340	That is not confirmed.
5027340	5031340	I'm getting that from a source that's usually pretty right on about these things.
5031340	5032340	So more to develop.
5032340	5035000	So I do encourage you, if you are listening to the show, you might just want to keep CNN
5035000	5039280	open in another tab and furiously hit refresh on that because if that is the news, that's
5039280	5044340	obviously going to have people talking about more than just games for quite some time.
5044340	5052460	And then he invites in the guy from, the announcer from NBA Jam, Boom Shakalaka.
5052460	5056900	Did you, by the way, not meaning to really derail so much, but did you see the White
5056900	5058420	House correspondent's speech?
5058420	5059420	I did.
5059420	5060420	That was brilliant.
5060420	5061420	I love that.
5061420	5062420	I love that man.
5062420	5063420	Good times.
5063420	5065260	I love that I voted for him.
5065260	5066780	His sense of humor is amazing.
5066780	5067780	Um, all right.
5067780	5074420	I, again, I just, I just know where to look for information and rumors that are usually
5074420	5075420	right on.
5075420	5076420	Hold on.
5076420	5077420	Hold on.
5077420	5079420	Let me just put a funny, maybe more of an image in your face.
5079420	5085020	Um, wouldn't it be hilarious if they just pulled a whole fucking weekend at Bernie's?
5085020	5086020	Oh shit.
5086020	5087020	Stop it.
5087020	5088020	Here's Osama bin Laden.
5088020	5089580	He's waving his hand.
5089580	5090580	All right.
5090580	5091580	Moving on.
5091580	5092580	Moving on.
5092580	5093580	Thank you.
5093580	5094660	Uh, Bobby actually gave me the original tip on that.
5094660	5095660	So thank you, Bobby.
5095660	5099460	Who told me to go look at CNN and that made me think to go, uh, check, uh, my tweet.
5099460	5100460	Yeah.
5100460	5104380	It's, it's again, not official, but my guy on Twitter who tends to be on top of this
5104380	5108700	stuff is rolling out all these sources that seem to point to that's being the case.
5108700	5110380	Well that, that'd be, uh, interesting.
5110380	5113780	That would be extremely interesting to say the least.
5113780	5118500	Anyway, we, the show must go on as they say, but I do know we live in a multitask world.
5118500	5122540	So those of you listening live may wish to all tab to CNN, but please don't turn us off.
5122540	5127340	Um, we'll, if, if the news is, if they confirm it or whatever it is, I will relay it for
5127340	5128340	you guys.
5128340	5129340	Okay.
5129340	5131340	How about I keep the website up and I'll keep an eye on it.
5131340	5132340	All right.
5132340	5133340	Okay.
5133340	5134340	Uh, moving on.
5134340	5137700	Let's talk about release dates and what is coming, uh, soon to a gaming, uh, store near
5137700	5138700	you.
5138700	5139700	Yes.
5139700	5142820	These games may not be able to be played by Osama bin Laden very soon, but, um, coming
5142820	5148300	next week, Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska for the Nintendo Wii, if you like your hunting
5148300	5153500	and you like your Alaska hunting and you like your Sarah Palin, but she's not in the game,
5153500	5154940	um, can't hunt her either.
5154940	5157540	So I don't know.
5157540	5158540	It's budget price.
5158540	5159540	I guess that might be good.
5159540	5166140	Uh, Thor God of Thunder or God of movie tie-in game that is coming out on PlayStation three,
5166140	5172420	Xbox 360, Wii, uh, DS, and, uh, that's it.
5172420	5173420	No 3DS.
5173420	5174420	Unfortunately that got delayed.
5174420	5180780	Yeah, you'd think it'd be easy to port over, um, also the game that I've been highly raving
5180780	5186940	about and I sadly enough haven't been playing much of it lately, just for no reason whatsoever,
5186940	5189660	but a Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on PlayStation three.
5189660	5195660	If you like racing games and you like crazy destruction and just all sorts of insane stuff
5195660	5199360	going on while you're racing, seriously go pick this game up.
5199360	5201140	It's just amazing.
5201140	5208980	So that's coming on PlayStation three this week and, um, sadly that is it.
5208980	5213260	That is all kind of good stuff for the rest of May though, but, uh, just unfortunately
5213260	5216100	next week is a little what are some other highlights in May just so I know what I should
5216100	5217100	be looking at.
5217100	5222420	Uh, well, uh, in two weeks we have a brink, which is going to be an awesome first person
5222420	5226420	shooter from Bethesda that's coming out, uh, Lego pirates.
5226420	5231420	If you're into that kind of thing, uh, MX versus ATV alive, if you like that, uh, and
5231420	5235700	then two weeks the game I'm looking forward to LA noir from rockstar games coming out.
5235700	5237620	Yes, there's quite a few people looking forward to that.
5237620	5239060	So that's going to be awesome.
5239060	5243500	And then of course, uh, towards the end of the month, uh, if you are a big fan of racing,
5243500	5249220	uh, dirt three coming out and a hunted the demons forge, um, if you're into those types
5249220	5250220	of games.
5250220	5253140	Um, unfortunately actually a lot of stuff that was supposed to become a month, fear
5253140	5257460	three, dungeon siege three and red faction all got delayed to June, but red faction looks
5257460	5258460	pretty good too.
5258460	5263520	Although it's kind of got a dead space vibe and I don't know, not really feeling dead
5263520	5264520	space.
5264520	5266260	So, but LA noir looks awesome.
5266260	5269940	So that's probably the next game I'll pick up and maybe brink, brink looks pretty cool
5269940	5270940	too.
5270940	5275020	All right, let's move on to Japan and what is going on with Japanese releases.
5275020	5277780	Um, this week, uh, Xbox three 60 is looking pretty dry.
5277780	5281100	There's not a lot going on the Xbox three 60 I'm, I have a feeling they have a quiet
5281100	5283380	week too cause they don't have anything on the PlayStation three as well.
5283380	5285620	I wonder if they have something huge on the handhelds.
5285620	5289900	Um, nothing on the Wii obviously because there's just nothing happening on the Wii these days
5289900	5291220	on the Sony PSP.
5291220	5293580	Yeah, nothing's happening until May 12th.
5293580	5296300	I'm not seeing anything.
5296300	5300860	There is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week.
5300860	5302180	That's it.
5302180	5303180	That's the releases.
5303180	5308580	Uh, May 12th steel diver on the, on the three DS, uh, which we've had here obviously since
5308580	5309580	release.
5309580	5314060	Uh, major league baseball on the 12th, but as far as the fifth, which the games are usually
5314060	5315060	out on Fridays.
5315060	5316060	Uh, nothing.
5316060	5317060	Wow.
5317060	5321900	It could be, it could be that all that's going on in the world as far as Japan is maybe shuffled
5321900	5322900	some things up.
5322900	5323900	I mean, it's don't know.
5323900	5324900	Possibly.
5324900	5329740	Well, we have a few releases for the UK on the fourth is Bongio HD missile fury for Xbox
5329740	5335380	three 60 Bongio is so much fun and there's section eight prejudice for PC and on the
5335380	5342020	sixth is sniper ghost warriors, steel diver, and Cabela's dangerous hunts to 2011.
5342020	5348700	Ooh, that's what I say about that.
5348700	5349700	All right.
5349700	5350700	Well, so much for release dates.
5350700	5352780	It's looking a little dry, no matter what part of the world you're in.
5352780	5354460	Uh, so let's go to Loki.
5354460	5355460	All right.
5355460	5358500	Um, well there's some interest.
5358500	5361420	The chat was yelling at me because I said the release dates are looking pretty dry in
5361420	5362420	Japan.
5362420	5363420	You guys are dummies.
5363420	5364620	All right.
5364620	5370300	I mean that with love, but seriously, all right, Loki, um, Sony revealed two new tablet
5370300	5373660	devices that are gonna be part of the PlayStation suite.
5373660	5382260	Um, one of them, uh, I guess they're officially the S one and S two tablets, which great.
5382260	5383260	That's nice.
5383260	5389020	Uh, they're both running Android 3.0 and uh, the S one tablet I guess has, there's any
5389020	5390700	like kind of an unconventional design.
5390700	5396140	It looks like that it's, uh, I don't know, it kind of tapers a little bit.
5396140	5401020	So it's like on a slant, but uh, basically 9.4 inch screen.
5401020	5407740	And then of course the S two tablet, it's a dual screen tablet and you know, people
5407740	5409820	are calling it looks saying it looks like the DS.
5409820	5413980	I guess you can, you know, run two different things at the same time.
5413980	5417460	You can watch a video and chat, you know, at the same time on the other screen or use
5417460	5420940	the other screen as a soft keyboard and you know, whatever.
5420940	5427980	Uh, but there are two 5.5 inch screens and um, both of course will be able to play select
5427980	5429540	PlayStation one games.
5429540	5430540	Tangible buttons.
5430540	5431540	Nope.
5431540	5432540	Couldn't care less.
5432540	5433540	Exactly.
5433540	5438460	So yeah, I'm not interested unless they were to have tangible buttons cause can you imagine
5438460	5441700	playing a PlayStation one game on your iPhone?
5441700	5445100	Cause that's what this is basically.
5445100	5451900	I mean seriously, so, all right, uh, anyhow, let's move on to, uh, another story.
5451900	5455260	This is also kind of a followup cause uh, last week in the middle of the show, uh, some
5455260	5459300	details were breaking on, well, I guess it was really that day, fantasy star online two
5459300	5460300	details.
5460300	5463860	Uh, we're getting some more information on what that was all about.
5463860	5470220	So there was a PSP two promotion event that was in Akihabara, uh, over last week.
5470220	5477620	And um, let's see, there was, uh, more information released on fantasy star online to, uh, apparently
5477620	5480380	now you're going to be able to jump in the game.
5480380	5486900	Also randomly generated hunting areas, some third person shooter style game play, uh,
5486900	5487900	and so on.
5487900	5489260	So they're adding jumping into it.
5489260	5493260	That could, uh, certainly make the levels different randomly generated hunting areas.
5493260	5498140	See, I seem to remember the levels in the old, uh, fantasy star games were online ones
5498140	5499940	were kind of randomly generated.
5499940	5503780	It seemed like there were like three different types of levels you could get.
5503780	5507980	So it'd be kind of neat if it's like a truly random generation thing going on.
5507980	5509740	So more information going on out there.
5509740	5514180	There's even a little video, but it looks like it was taken down.
5514180	5515900	So there you go.
5515900	5516900	All right.
5516900	5518660	So, uh, what's going on over there?
5518660	5524440	Real, you guys are watching real world and, uh, it was just said national journal learned
5524440	5525440	it's true.
5525440	5529060	It says, uh, yeah, according to MSNBC, they're saying president Obama make a statement soon
5529060	5533020	regarding Osama bin Laden, Fox news saying that New York times is saying it.
5533020	5535420	So it looks like, uh, there you go.
5535420	5536420	All right.
5536420	5540900	Sweet back to, uh, again, keep CNN open in another tab.
5540900	5541900	Uh, there you go.
5541900	5546020	If you're listening to the show or whatever your, I say CNN, but whatever your website
5546020	5547020	of choice is.
5547020	5548020	Okay.
5548020	5549020	Kids.
5549020	5550020	All right.
5550020	5551020	BBC news.
5551020	5552620	Let's get to something extremely important.
5552620	5554780	This could be almost more important.
5554780	5558660	It isn't more important, but almost if there was anything that was as important, it would
5558660	5564020	be this, a trip down memory lane for dark Sakura where every week she decides, Hey,
5564020	5569900	you guys should be playing this video game classic game of the week.
5569900	5570900	Dark Sakura.
5570900	5573540	Tell us about what is the classic game of the week.
5573540	5580300	The game of the week is afterburner, which came out in 1987 it's a flight SIM arcade
5580300	5581960	game put out by Sega.
5581960	5586900	It had a motion full motion seats, um, at least for the deluxe cabinet.
5586900	5589940	It was also designed by you Suzuki who is the man.
5589940	5597580	Um, anyway, you control an F 14 Tomcat and you go through 18 stages and you take off
5597580	5603260	from an aircraft character called the Sega enterprise, which is a, an homage to top gun
5603260	5605700	and not star Trek.
5605700	5612500	And so the, it had basically of integrated flight stick that would control the way the
5612500	5618420	cabinet moved either back and forth and it had, you know, hydraulics in it and it would
5618420	5620340	have Canada missile buttons.
5620340	5625940	It was also a stand, um, a standing upright one, but the rotating cockpit one was the
5625940	5627660	awesome one.
5627660	5633360	So, um, it was, I mean, basically it's just straightforward.
5633360	5639060	You shoot down planes and you have like a lock for your missiles and you can shoot them
5639060	5641380	down and you choose, you know, your direction.
5641380	5646060	There's also afterburner two, which was the sequel that was put out the same year.
5646060	5652780	And um, then, uh, there were other games that focus on the F 14 Tomcat, like G lock air
5652780	5658460	battle and strike fighter that was actually rebranded as afterburner three and then sky
5658460	5659460	target.
5659460	5665660	There was also Sega strike fighter, which was, uh, a free roaming type of F 14 game.
5665660	5669300	And then we got afterburner climax, which is the one that I played just this week.
5669300	5670300	That's really sweet.
5670300	5675580	There's also a PSP, um, release called afterburner black Falcon.
5675580	5680220	And uh, actually some of the music in this was, uh, remixed for Bayonetta.
5680220	5682660	It was pretty cool.
5682660	5686740	As far as other versions that have been out, there was Amiga, the Amstrad, the Atari ST,
5686740	5692700	sharp X68000, at them towns, Commodore 64, Nest, Sega master system, PC engine, Sega
5692700	5695980	Saturn, PC, MSX, and ZX spectrum.
5695980	5701660	And then, um, there was a 32 X version that was called, um, afterburner complete in Japan
5701660	5702660	in Europe.
5702660	5704100	But I'll tell you what's cool about that.
5704100	5708340	And also is the same for space Harrier on 32 X is that it's the arcade version, the
5708340	5709380	full arcade version.
5709380	5713820	You can actually do a little trick to make it say insert coin, you know, so it's kind
5713820	5714820	of, kind of neat.
5714820	5717220	It's, it's pretty much the same rom.
5717220	5722780	And the little article here has a few other, uh, uh, bits and pieces like in Terminator
5722780	5726140	2 Judgment Day, John Connor's playing afterburner.
5726140	5728380	Oh, that's right.
5728380	5729380	I forgot about that.
5729380	5730380	Yeah, he is.
5730380	5738100	And in red dwarf seasons two and three, there was an afterburner in the bar area and pretty
5738100	5739100	cool.
5739100	5740100	Yeah.
5740100	5741580	I love the music in this game.
5741580	5744580	I'm really surprised you have never done afterburner before.
5744580	5750740	Well, in an afterburner, I have to say is not one of my favorite games, but I love afterburner
5750740	5751740	climb.
5751740	5752740	I love the cabin.
5752740	5758800	Well, afterburner climax actually has a full, um, full on hydraulic seats that has front
5758800	5760460	backside up down motion.
5760460	5762980	So it's super, super fun.
5762980	5767140	And the other thing that was really great about these is that they did include a motion
5767140	5768140	stop.
5768140	5770140	So if you couldn't take it, it would just stop the movement.
5770140	5772140	It was pretty cool.
5772140	5774460	But yeah, afterburner.
5774460	5775740	All right.
5775740	5778140	There it is your classic game of the week.
5778140	5784060	Liberty afterburner best known in its arcade release, but certainly ported to plenty of
5784060	5785060	home consoles.
5785060	5786060	All right.
5786060	5788700	We're going to take a quick break here, uh, at orange launch radio, but don't go anywhere
5788700	5789700	guys.
5789700	5791500	We're going to be right back with plenty more of the show tonight.
5791500	5795480	Uh, we've been talking a lot about PlayStation, but there's been big news on Xbox this week
5795480	5796480	as well.
5796480	5797480	So we're gonna talk about that as well.
5797480	5799340	Uh, some 3DS news as well.
5799340	5801300	And Loki is going to bring us some hacking news.
5801300	5811420	All we come back after a quick break with more of orange lounge radio.
5811420	5813740	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.
5813740	5820020	We are live on this Sunday evening, May the 1st of 2011 with the 411th episode of our
5820020	5825020	show where we're giving you not just the four one one on what's going on with PSN and all
5825020	5827620	that stuff, but apparently what's going on in the real world as well.
5827620	5832380	Uh, it's quite a, uh, exciting evening, but in the interest of those that are, uh, we'll
5832380	5835380	keep you abreast of anything huge develops, but in the interest of those that listen to
5835380	5841980	the podcast throughout the week, by the time this will be long reported to death, uh, yes.
5841980	5846180	There's one little announcement that's going to be closer to 1130 central time that the
5846180	5847180	announcement will be made.
5847180	5851100	They're still working on final statements, but everything's set up.
5851100	5856060	So that will be 9 30 Pacific for our live listeners.
5856060	5857060	All right.
5857060	5858060	So let's move on though with the show.
5858060	5861380	We want to get back into video games, especially out of the interest of those that listen to
5861380	5862380	the show throughout the week.
5862380	5866100	By the time this has been long reported on, I'm going to name my first born wolf after
5866100	5867100	Wolf Blitzer.
5867100	5868740	Yes, because Wolf was a freaking bad ass.
5868740	5871860	How about what was the name of the dog that played piano on the Muppets?
5871860	5872860	Was that Ralph?
5872860	5873860	Ralph.
5873860	5874860	I like that.
5874860	5875860	No wolf.
5875860	5876860	How about what if you have twins?
5876860	5877860	Can you have Wolf and Ralph?
5877860	5883540	I'll have Wolf and uh, Wolf and Fox.
5883540	5884540	All right.
5884540	5886020	Let's move on back into the show.
5886020	5887820	Uh, first spinoff shows.
5887820	5890540	If you'd like orange launch radio, there's some other shows you might like as well.
5890540	5894340	Uh, I do one, it's called the best little hoard house in the Azeroth.
5894340	5896140	It's a show about all things world of Warcraft.
5896140	5897140	This week was a fun week.
5897140	5898500	It was our international edition.
5898500	5903660	We had this gal seal from the, uh, girls gone wild podcast and she is a Dutch lady living
5903660	5908100	in the UK South East, I know she's Southwest and the Southwest part of the UK.
5908100	5910220	I saw you use the underwear picture.
5910220	5911220	What's that?
5911220	5912220	Oh yeah.
5912220	5913220	The album art.
5913220	5914220	Yes.
5914220	5915220	For your album art.
5915220	5917460	The album art for a word house changes every episode.
5917460	5918460	I don't know.
5918460	5919460	It's just a thing.
5919460	5922260	Something I want to do for a house and a dark soccer has actually been probably about two
5922260	5924340	thirds of the art has come from dark soccer's pictures.
5924340	5929140	Uh, the third mind, I've actually tried to capture like different events that happen
5929140	5933700	in the game that people will recognize, you know, like the one I've got of, uh, my character
5933700	5936780	sitting with the turtle when you are in high jaw.
5936780	5937780	Right.
5937780	5938780	So I like crazy stuff.
5938780	5942180	So if you like a world of Warcraft and all that, and it's a busy week, this is a busy
5942180	5943180	news week too.
5943180	5948300	The 4.1, that big patch hit and the 4.2 patch, lots of news coming out on that, uh, patch
5948300	5950500	and it's going to be very awesome.
5950500	5952060	All right.
5952060	5953060	So anyhow, you want to hear more?
5953060	5954060	Wow.
5954060	5955060	Geekery.
5955060	5956060	Check it out.
5956060	5957060	Hoardhouse.com dark soccer.
5957060	5958060	You got a show.
5958060	5959060	Call it comic insanity.
5959060	5962040	Although we haven't done one for a month now because we've just had a lot of stuff going
5962040	5967220	on in the world of comics is not that much exciting, but you can find us at infamous.net
5967220	5975300	and we should have a new one I think next week, so keep, keep your, your, uh, eyes open
5975300	5976300	on the website.
5976300	5977300	We're pretty cool.
5977300	5982340	I do it with, uh, with Mara and Marvel and Dan shadow and we're cool.
5982340	5984100	All right.
5984100	5985420	And you actually came back this week?
5985420	5986420	No, we didn't.
5986420	5988420	Cause she, she's in Disneyland.
5988420	5989420	Oh, bitch.
5989420	5990420	We're going.
5990420	5992180	And I mean that babe in total control of herself.
5992180	5993180	We're going.
5993180	5994180	Yes.
5994180	5995180	I don't know.
5995180	5996180	And it's her, it's for her birthday.
5996180	5999900	I don't know how to talk about this, how openly, but there's like this awesome Disneyland trip
5999900	6000900	happening very soon.
6000900	6004860	Well, not very soon, but soon that's going to involve at least one other person, not
6004860	6005860	in this room.
6005860	6007860	It's going to be epic epicness.
6007860	6009900	So more to come on that later.
6009900	6010900	Anyhow.
6010900	6011900	All right.
6011900	6013900	Let's move on.
6013900	6015220	Rapid fire news.
6015220	6019060	All the stuff that, uh, we just don't have 20 minutes to talk about, especially in light
6019060	6023980	of all the PSN and real world news going on tonight, but we wanted to tip our hat to these
6023980	6024980	stories.
6024980	6025980	Oh, one thing.
6025980	6028660	They said it was officially killed by the U S okay.
6028660	6029660	All right.
6029660	6030660	Of course.
6030660	6035020	We wouldn't be announcing it if we didn't do it ourselves or we didn't say, yeah, those
6035020	6042220	guys in the UK, you know, we could end the show early if you guys just want to focus
6042220	6043220	on this.
6043220	6046960	No, I realize it's important news, but I'm just, I'm worried about the podcast he's listening
6046960	6050740	throughout the week who have probably heard this a million times by now.
6050740	6051740	All right.
6051740	6052740	Anyways.
6052740	6059500	So red box is now finally rolling out game rentals, um, for all of their, uh, kiosks,
6059500	6061980	uh, 21,000 to be exact.
6061980	6062980	Well, not exactly.
6062980	6064980	I guess that's kind of an estimate.
6064980	6071660	Um, starting June 17th and, uh, those rentals will run you $2 a day and they're going to
6071660	6077700	be a guest, um, including some of the top AAA games and some family games as well.
6077700	6080500	Um, so that's pretty awesome.
6080500	6085300	So if you're looking for another place to rent games and you know, maybe just game flies
6085300	6089740	and getting stuff to you quick enough, you can, uh, check out a red box machine, which
6089740	6092820	are everywhere now.
6092820	6098920	Death Smiles 2X has been rated by the ESRB and of course we could probably expect that
6098920	6103700	on the Xbox 360 marketplace very soon.
6103700	6108260	Um, of course they've been putting a lot of other cave shmup games on there.
6108260	6114500	So you know, I wouldn't expect this to be too much different than some of the other
6114500	6115500	cave shooters.
6115500	6118700	But if you like your shmup games, uh, more coming.
6118700	6120620	So that's pretty cool.
6120620	6125160	And then finally, uh, first there was a leaked teaser and then officially announced Need
6125160	6132660	For Speed The Run is coming to stores November 15th in the North American regions, November
6132660	6134460	17th in Europe.
6134460	6139860	And of course, um, it is rumored that EA Black Box is the one doing the game.
6139860	6144100	And they're saying that apparently, uh, it will be kind of a cross country cannonball
6144100	6148300	run style game from San Francisco to New York.
6148300	6152300	And not only will you be racing against, you know, police and whatnot, but you'll also
6152300	6157140	be racing through like dense urban traffic, icy mountain passes and Nero Canyon.
6157140	6161960	So kind of a little bit of, uh, you versus the elements versus police and stuff.
6161960	6168340	So sounds pretty chaotic, might be fun and that'll be coming out this fall.
6168340	6172620	Well did you hear the one about Marshfield, Massachusetts and you're probably like, what?
6172620	6173740	Unless you live there.
6173740	6180380	Uh, but yeah, Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1982, they actually banned arcade games from
6180380	6182080	public establishments.
6182080	6183080	That's right.
6183080	6187140	You're not allowed to have a coin op game in an establishment in Marshfield, Massachusetts.
6187140	6189500	It's like footloose for video games.
6189500	6190500	Kind of.
6190500	6194580	The law was actually upheld once by the state Supreme Court the next year and it's always
6194580	6196420	been in place since then.
6196420	6200760	Uh, however, uh, they might actually be, and the reason why this is relevant now, 29 years
6200760	6205060	later is that they are looking at possibly reversing that law.
6205060	6209260	Uh, state law actually permits Keno to be allowed in bars and other buildings.
6209260	6212300	So what the hell is wrong with coin op games existing?
6212300	6217340	Uh, the town meeting is happening this next week and voters will be able to overturn the
6217340	6218340	law.
6218340	6219540	Uh, so it'll be up to the voters.
6219540	6223500	So if you know anyone there, uh, you probably want to get them to vote to overturn this
6223500	6224500	law.
6224500	6227900	Although at the same time, I suppose if they've gotten by for 29 years without coin op games
6227900	6230300	in town, they'll probably get by another 29.
6230300	6233260	There's also that part of me that says, what coin op games?
6233260	6238300	Cause you know, outside of the Tron pinball news we had earlier, there's not a lot of
6238300	6239820	games going on.
6239820	6244160	Anyhow, um, a game that's rumored to be coming out on the connect fruit ninja.
6244160	6248300	It's a very popular game, of course, on the iPhone and iPad devices.
6248300	6252980	Fruit Ninja connect is apparently a game that's just recently been rated in Korea.
6252980	6256740	That's not usually the country we get our rating board leaks from, but, uh, it is what
6256740	6257740	it is.
6257740	6261860	Fruit Ninja connect has been leaked as a rated game in Korea.
6261860	6264780	Uh, of course they don't say what system this is for.
6264780	6268340	Well, I mean they, it's for the 360, excuse me, but they don't say if it's a disc game
6268340	6271380	or an Xbox live arcade game or how it's being delivered.
6271380	6276460	My assumption is that it's going to be an Xbox live arcade game just based on what the
6276460	6278020	source material is.
6278020	6280660	But we won't know for a little while.
6280660	6284000	Uh, also one other piece of the thing came to light this week.
6284000	6288500	Apparently there was a Sonic skating board game or sorry, skateboarding game that went
6288500	6290820	unreleased during the Xbox era.
6290820	6296620	Uh, it was discovered by a post on the Sonic retro fan site at Sonic retro.org.
6296620	6299140	Uh, it was a game called Sonic extreme.
6299140	6300700	It was by the Sonic team.
6300700	6305260	It was for the original Xbox and it was very similar to the skateboarding stuff in Sonic
6305260	6309500	adventure two, uh, but apparently it was a whole game based around it.
6309500	6313540	Uh, or it could be what ended up being Sonic writers.
6313540	6317220	Not sure, but there's some video out there that has leaked and you can check that out
6317220	6323740	either on YouTube or at that Sonic retro site, Sonic retro.org also known as when Sonic was
6323740	6324740	good.org.
6324740	6326940	That was my little joke.
6326940	6334020	All right, let's move on, uh, to some more rapid fire news, dark Sakura.
6334020	6341620	While we do have some news for fans of black ops, uh, there is going to be a download content
6341620	6347060	pack called call of the dead as George Romero as himself.
6347060	6351500	Um, basically it's a lots of a zombie fan service.
6351500	6360420	It's going to be making the dead go splat and uh, it should be a pretty neat.
6360420	6366140	Then, um, we have, uh, blaze blue shirts that are going for Japan relief.
6366140	6371820	Um, access games has, uh, everything on sale and I will put a link to that in the chat

6384700	6386500	the whole thing.
6386500	6392260	And then rock band has some, uh, cool bean stuff coming up, including some, uh, culture
6392260	6393900	club downloads.
6393900	6397420	So let me get what's on the list for you.
6397420	6400720	That's going to be of course, Xbox 360, Wii and PS3.

6421660	6424140	Oh, and so does, um, stashed by fish.
6424140	6426020	Fish is cool.
6426020	6429540	So yay.
6429540	6430540	All right.
6430540	6433780	Um, real quick to kind of add on a little bit what you were saying about the called
6433780	6434780	it an expansion.
6434780	6440380	Uh, not only does it have, uh, George Romero, he is playing this crazy Uber zombie in it.
6440380	6443580	Uh, but it also has Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Michelle Geller.
6443580	6444580	I'm sorry.
6444580	6446340	Yeah, that would be, that's way better.
6446340	6451820	Sarah Michelle Parker or, uh, Sarah Jessica Parker would probably, she'd be like a plastic
6451820	6452820	zombie.
6452820	6453820	Yes.
6453820	6454820	A plastic zombie.
6454820	6455820	No.
6455820	6460860	Um, Michael Rooker, uh, Danny Trejo and, uh, Robert Englund and, um, yeah, all, all kind
6460860	6467660	of, almost like playing themselves, you know, like they've got, you know, um, Robert Englund
6467660	6472940	has kind of like some catch phrases that sort of, you know, hint at, you know, Nightmare
6472940	6478620	on Elm Street and he has a pitchfork and then Danny Trejo has a machete and, uh, Michael
6478620	6480900	Rooker kind of looks like a biker.
6480900	6485660	So, um, looks pretty neat.
6485660	6486660	All right.
6486660	6488820	Well, let's move on to some Twitter topics.
6488820	6494460	Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash O L R tweet, tweet, tweet, uh, and,
6494460	6499060	uh, you guys send us your tweets and we read them live here on the show.
6499060	6504780	Let's go to, uh, the first tweet tonight from Rhetortainment tweets us saying, I like putting
6504780	6506300	corn on my tax.
6506300	6507300	Is this weird?
6507300	6509620	I don't even like, is there a joke there?
6509620	6510620	Is there an inside joke there?
6510620	6515300	I'm not getting, I like to put corn on my tax corn tax, like, like, I don't know.
6515300	6518980	Is that like corn on the cob or maybe a play on contact?
6518980	6519980	Maybe.
6519980	6520980	I don't know.
6520980	6521980	Rhetortainment.
6521980	6522980	Explain yourself.
6522980	6523980	All right.
6523980	6524980	Flaming toilets.
6524980	6526580	Uh, tweeting us saying, are you going to talk about PlayStation network?
6526580	6528220	Cause nobody's talked about that yet.
6528220	6532260	Uh, yes, we are going to talk about it and now we're done talking about it.
6532260	6536740	Uh, let's see more tweets, uh, DJ Rama S tweets us and says, Hey, what's your definition
6536740	6537740	of shovelware?
6537740	6538740	Good question.
6538740	6540340	What's your definition of shovelware?
6540340	6545580	My definition of shovelware is a game that is so blatant in copying another game.
6545580	6548380	You just, you can't even tell.
6548380	6549380	That's right.
6549380	6554340	A very, very rushed game that is put out for the sole purpose of capitalizing on what's
6554340	6556340	popular.
6556340	6561740	In dark soccer, Loki, anything you guys want to add to that game with next to none, uh,
6561740	6562740	production values?
6562740	6564660	I mean, it just looks like crap.
6564660	6565660	Everything's broken in it.
6565660	6569540	It's just think of the ditch.
6569540	6571360	It's absolutely useless.
6571360	6574340	You shun your friends for buying it.
6574340	6576980	Is there any traditional value in dirt?
6576980	6578980	No, neither.
6578980	6584100	Is there any entertainment value of shovelware?
6584100	6585100	All right.
6585100	6586780	Let's see one or a couple more tweets.
6586780	6587780	Excuse me.
6587780	6591660	Blue swim is tweeting us saying, shit, Loki, and that's it.
6591660	6592660	No shit.
6592660	6595100	Loki talked about what I was going to call or about.
6595100	6596380	Got to rethink my call.
6596380	6601340	We could call in and just be a Loki fan and just be like, yeah, I agree with you, man.
6601340	6603420	On second thought, let's not inflate his ego anymore.
6603420	6604420	All right.
6604420	6605700	Uh, other tweets.
6605700	6606860	Oh, this is one.
6606860	6607860	Yeah.
6607860	6608860	Gosh.
6608860	6609860	This slipped off the radar here.
6609860	6610860	We want to say something about this.
6610860	6611860	Thank you to tiger claw who tweeted this.
6611860	6615660	There were some details on Marvel universe because you know, DC universe online cannot
6615660	6616660	go unchallenged.
6616660	6619780	Uh, there were some details on Marvel universe revealed this week.
6619780	6621900	It was at a event in San Francisco by gazillion.
6621900	6624620	Uh, the game is being developed by secret identity.
6624620	6629020	Uh, that's a team that was specifically assembled to make the MMO.
6629020	6632140	It's going to be a free to play MMO.
6632140	6635180	Get that Marvel universe is going to be free dark soccer.
6635180	6636180	Any interest in that?
6636180	6637180	A free to play Marvel MMO.
6637180	6638180	I'll be all over that.
6638180	6639180	Yeah.
6639180	6640180	Is it a freemium?
6640180	6643580	Uh, well I'm assuming it has to be, if it's free to play, it's freemium.
6643580	6644580	Absolutely.
6644580	6647420	Um, but oh, I've actually remembered reading something about this.
6647420	6654500	Um, cause I follow, um, uh, agent M on Twitter and apparently I think he said it or somebody
6654500	6657660	with Marvel said it that Bendis has a hand in the writing.
6657660	6658660	So that's pretty cool.
6658660	6662060	Uh, dr doom is going to be the antagonist, at least in the launch of the game.
6662060	6665580	They're saying that you will be able to play as famous Marvel heroes, captain America,
6665580	6671100	iron man, Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, Nova, and squirrel girl squirrel girl is awesome.
6671100	6672100	I have no idea.
6672100	6676940	I mean, if everybody's the hero, so there must be like an instance thing or maybe kind
6676940	6680620	of what they do in DC universe where it's, I don't know, it's Jessica Jones.
6680620	6681900	I'm very curious.
6681900	6685300	Uh, Brian Michael Bendis is doing some writing for the game.
6685300	6688540	Uh, the game story missions are taken from the comic themselves.
6688540	6693100	Uh, otherwise don't know if it has to do with anything to do with the Marvel universe online.
6693100	6697900	The cryptic was once developing in Microsoft, uh, before that project was canceled.
6697900	6700700	So this is all about the PC universe of the game.
6700700	6705020	Gazillion is saying that, uh, originally it was developed for consoles as well, but they
6705020	6708860	are not confirming or denying if it's still coming to consoles at this time.
6708860	6710340	Squirrel girl is awesome.
6710340	6712260	Who is squirrel girl for the uninitiated?
6712260	6715940	Squirrel girl, her mutant power is basically being an anthropomorphic squirrel and she
6715940	6717140	can talk telepathically.
6717140	6719420	She can talk to squirrels and understand their language.
6719420	6723340	But the thing is, is that she's actually defeated Dr. Doom and Thanos, the real thing by the
6723340	6728660	way, and all kinds of just bad guys and also kicked Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Avengers
6728660	6733140	mansion and told him to shut his evil, evil pie hole.
6733140	6734140	She's super fun.
6734140	6738540	Actually, right now she's the babysitter, well, I guess nanny slash babysitter for Jessica
6738540	6739540	Jones and Luke Cage's baby.
6739540	6740540	The nanny.
6740540	6747280	But I, Mr. Sheffield, I, you know, I like, I like some, some of the cheese ball characters
6747280	6750020	and she's cheese ball, but actually cheese ball in a fun way.
6750020	6754900	I want to have a character in Marvel universe that's the nanny as a superhero.
6754900	6761060	There actually was a, was, um, a bad guy who was a nanny and orphan maker.
6761060	6762500	Or super nanny.
6762500	6764300	You've been very, very naughty.
6764300	6766980	Now you need to go to the naughty corner.
6766980	6768540	It was nanny and orphan maker.
6768540	6769540	Okay.
6769540	6770540	All right, let's move on.
6770540	6772300	Yes, I know my obscure.
6772300	6775460	Another tweet from Tiger Claw.
6775460	6779180	This show, this show started off so well and then there's this stuff going on in the real
6779180	6781740	world and now it's just, oh, who cares anymore?
6781740	6782740	All right.
6782740	6784760	A tweet, another tweet from Tiger Claw.
6784760	6786020	It's about LA noir.
6786020	6789860	Um, there'll be social, I guess there's a social club for this.
6789860	6790860	Uh, what is this?
6790860	6791860	Is this on Facebook or something?
6791860	6793420	It's rockstar social club.
6793420	6795420	It's it's a website thing that they have.
6795420	6797020	It's tied in with all rockstar games.
6797020	6798020	Okay.
6798020	6802060	Well, if you get through the whole thing, you get a exclusive outfit for the game.
6802060	6804380	So I guess it's an incentive to get in on that thing.
6804380	6806900	If you're into that, if you're like, uh, if you're into the Barbie doll stuff in your
6806900	6807900	video games.
6807900	6808900	No, social club's pretty fun.
6808900	6811940	They had a bunch of stuff with Grand Theft Auto like they did, uh, you know, they have
6811940	6817340	the leaderboards for multiplayer, which I, you know, paid attention to a lot for a while.
6817340	6821340	Um, they had things like the Grand Theft, it was a delivery city marathon where they
6821340	6826540	tracked how long, how far you ran, how far you drove, you know, how many bullets you
6826540	6827980	spent, that kind of stuff.
6827980	6831100	So they do a bunch of different things and then also they do stuff with like Red Dead
6831100	6835700	Redemption with, um, you know, they have little challenges that you do and you unlock skins
6835700	6837860	and stuff like that through those challenges.
6837860	6839860	So that's kind of neat.
6839860	6843900	Uh, yeah, the costume you're going to unlock on the social club, if you're a member, the
6843900	6848900	Chicago lightning suit, it's for the protagonist, Cole Phillips, in the game.
6848900	6854060	And if you're online, you get to access the ask the community feature in game.
6854060	6856820	And if you're interrogating a suspect, you don't know if they're telling the truth or
6856820	6860660	not, you can see how other players responded in the same situation.
6860660	6864940	They're calling it a who wants to be a millionaire, ask the audience lifeline.
6864940	6865940	That's kind of crazy.
6865940	6868100	I like, I like that kind of idea for games though.
6868100	6873300	Well, they had a thing come out, um, you know, about that game as well, where if you were
6873300	6879820	having trouble in certain spots and whatnot, you could actually, um, bypass some of the
6879820	6882060	action sequences in the game.
6882060	6886140	So like if you keep failing over and over and over again, um, you can just skip past
6886140	6890140	it and get back to the narrative stuff, which is kind of unique.
6890140	6896180	All right, uh, let's move on with, uh, some more gaming news.
6896180	6899780	That was it for Twitter topics tonight, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to talk to us throughout
6899780	6900780	the week.
6900780	6901780	Back to some other news.
6901780	6902780	Loki.
6902780	6909300	Uh, Gamasutra ran kind of a editorial about the whole PlayStation, you know, debacle,
6909300	6910940	I guess, right now.
6910940	6916060	Basically they were saying, you know, the PlayStation brand faces an uncertain future
6916060	6920420	and they're worried that, you know, Sony's kind of, well, as we kind of put it before,
6920420	6922140	not handling the situation correctly.
6922140	6925340	Like for example, here's a little test for you.
6925340	6928980	Which of the following statements are most likely, are you most likely to agree with
6928980	6930900	in a one year's term?
6930900	6933340	A, Sony handled the situation amazingly.
6933340	6936500	They held up their hands and took appropriate share of the blame.
6936500	6940600	They outlined a clear plan of action to remedy the situation and made sure that all stakeholders
6940600	6946460	were recompensed beyond reasonable expectations.
6946460	6952980	And they showed their human side and came out of this a stronger company.
6952980	6955820	Or B, it just kind of went away, didn't it?
6955820	6961580	Sony entirely laid the blame on hackers, launched a lot of legal flak, refused to take any responsibility,
6961580	6967160	offered minimum clarity and token recompense.
6967160	6971780	That no one cares anymore, at least they've encrypted my personal data now.
6971780	6976180	And of course, you know, most people probably agree with B.
6976180	6979340	And even like, you know, they were saying like, you know, their response has been pretty
6979340	6980340	pitiful.
6980340	6984860	You know, the best they did was sent out an email and posted a post on their blog.
6984860	6992020	I mean, if you even read it, they said, we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern
6992020	6993500	this outage has caused.
6993500	6997260	You know, they're saying this outage is like it's inclement weather.
6997260	6999860	And they also said, we made a mistake here.
6999860	7000860	We picked a fight.
7000860	7001860	We couldn't win.
7001860	7004420	Or no, they're saying they should have said, we made a mistake here.
7004420	7005420	We picked a fight.
7005420	7006420	We couldn't win.
7006420	7012140	And even with TAC, highly likely, we neglected the protector stuff.
7012140	7018060	So you know, what they're saying is they could handle this, you know, in a way that could
7018060	7023340	kind of get people to trust them again, you know, just kind of showing their human side.
7023340	7027180	But without it, you know, and it kind of like what we were going back to before with, you
7027180	7032100	know, talking about Jack in the Box and, you know, that's something they mentioned JetBlue,
7032100	7035820	for example, had, you know, kind of a debacle.
7035820	7043940	And they ended up coming out of a better company because they spent time, effort to, you know,
7043940	7049300	improve their customer service and, you know, in turn, they became a strong company.
7049300	7054140	So Domino's Pizza, Toyota, you know, those are some of the brands that were kind of hard
7054140	7060820	by, you know, a situation like this, but then they kind of turned it around with their,
7060820	7065420	you know, dedication to, you know, kind of changing their ways.
7065420	7068020	Sony so far have said, you know, here's some DLC.
7068020	7072380	Oh yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to protect your data now.
7072380	7074460	So I think they're kind of right.
7074460	7080100	I don't know, I think that PlayStation brand as far as trusting them with, you know, my
7080100	7088420	information, maybe, maybe that's harmed a bit, but they're kind of stretching the PlayStation
7088420	7092140	brand a little thin, if you ask me, especially with like tablet devices and stuff now.
7092140	7095340	It's like, just because it plays PlayStation one games, I don't really know if you should
7095340	7097700	call it like a PlayStation device.
7097700	7099340	Uh, yeah.
7099340	7102700	And you know, I, I hate to kind of beat a dead horse because we were talking about this
7102700	7106540	in part A anyway, and it's kind of like, I really think Sony can recover from this despite
7106540	7110500	what all the, uh, rampant angry gamer chat on the internet would make you think.
7110500	7114380	Uh, but you know, it's like Microsoft recovered from the red ring of death thing and let's
7114380	7116780	be real, that was a pretty serious thing that happened.
7116780	7121180	But Nintendo recovered from, well, the virtual boy.
7121180	7126380	So you know, companies can recover and they will, but they have to do the right thing.
7126380	7127380	Yeah, exactly.
7127380	7129060	Like being hard headed is not the right thing.
7129060	7133420	And granted Microsoft, I think they never really came up, obviously they didn't come
7133420	7137820	up front and say how many of their systems were affected by the red ring problem.
7137820	7138820	Here's a hint.
7138820	7140640	It was all of them at launch.
7140640	7144940	Every single one, every single one will die eventually.
7144940	7147740	I know this, it will happen.
7147740	7148900	Every single one.
7148900	7149900	You'll be lucky.
7149900	7152660	I would, I don't know.
7152660	7156300	I would be very impressed to see a system that actually is one of their launch systems
7156300	7159660	that's still working today, that's being rigorously played.
7159660	7162780	I guarantee that there's less than like one percent.
7162780	7167380	But anyways, let's be honest, they fixed it after multiple iterations and tweaks and stuff
7167380	7168380	like that.
7168380	7169740	Now their system is stable.
7169740	7173100	It's not, you know, it's not dying.
7173100	7177220	They improved their warranties and stuff, you know, three years and stuff and they covered
7177220	7178700	replacements for a lot of it.
7178700	7182380	So yeah, it sucked having to replace the system like a bunch of times and stuff.
7182380	7185540	Apple and the iPhone 4, that's another big one too with the antenna gate.
7185540	7186540	Remember that?
7186540	7187540	Oh yeah.
7187540	7188540	And they've recovered fine.
7188540	7191180	iPads 2s are selling like crazy.
7191180	7198940	But it's all about how you handle it, and I mean really, I'm sorry, not everyone reads
7198940	7200800	the Playstation blog, okay?
7200800	7204900	If you're looking at your average mom and pop users, say they have, you know, sign up
7204900	7208420	on the Playstation network and they buy stuff through there, they're not reading the internet
7208420	7211920	blogs, you know, and stuff, and yeah, okay, they get an email.
7211920	7217500	So let's just say, for example, that they used an email with that service that maybe
7217500	7219140	they don't use that quite regularly.
7219140	7223860	So they would have absolutely no idea this is going on until they hear it from like a
7223860	7229180	media outlet saying, oh yeah, Sony's just, you know, been hacked and all these people's
7229180	7232980	credit information, you know, credit card information has been leaked out.
7232980	7233980	Ah!
7233980	7235840	That's not good.
7235840	7241100	I mean you need to be telling your customers up front, or at least, you know, being a little
7241100	7245900	bit more clear about it, put out a statement or something, you know, I know that they did
7245900	7252500	the press conference thing, but I'm sorry though, you're just pointing blame, so.
7252500	7258580	But we'll see, it'll be interesting, E3 I'm sure they're gonna mention something, I mean,
7258580	7262860	obviously it's still gonna be fresh in everybody's mind.
7262860	7267540	Alright well, obviously it's not just Sony with news in the world right now, Xbox, they
7267540	7269100	had a pretty big thing come out this week.
7269100	7274620	Hulu Plus actually just came out to the system, it was released on April 29th, and yeah, it
7274620	7278580	was kind of fast, like the news came out during the week and then suddenly, whoo, bam, there's
7278580	7279700	Hulu Plus.
7279700	7284700	Now there is actually this whole sponsorship going on, and I apologize, I forgot the company
7284700	7287900	that was sponsoring it, but it doesn't matter, they're not paying us.
7287900	7292820	So some company is actually sponsoring a two week preview of Hulu Plus right now, and then
7292820	7296700	I guess you can also get another one if you actually sign up through Hulu's website, and
7296700	7298820	you get a two week trial there as well.
7298820	7302980	So if you wanna try out Hulu Plus for like a month, you can do so.
7302980	7306580	I have not signed up for it and probably I'm not going to, I think Hulu Plus is kind of
7306580	7310100	a shitty idea, because I'm not a fan of the fact that there's still commercials and you're
7310100	7311100	paying for it.
7311100	7315540	Like honestly, I've got Netflix, it's got the shows I wanna see, otherwise if they don't
7315540	7317380	have it, I'll just torrent it.
7317380	7322300	Like I'm not, you know, not to come out and admit that I'm a bloody thief or whatever,
7322300	7327020	but like I'd use Hulu if it was money or commercials, but not both.
7327020	7332020	That's just ridiculous to me, make your money one way or the other.
7332020	7335060	So yeah, I guess they have a lot of good stuff though.
7335060	7338420	I mean the free Hulu online is kind of cool, I kind of wish you could do free Hulu through
7338420	7342500	the Xbox, the ad supported, because you can watch like the entire run of Dark Shadows
7342500	7343500	through Hulu.
7343500	7346660	But you know what, Netflix just got Twin Peaks like a couple weeks ago, and seriously if
7346660	7348360	you guys have never watched Twin Peaks, it's awesome.
7348360	7351020	You can do Hulu through your Xbox.
7351020	7352020	How?
7352020	7353400	Diversity.
7353400	7354400	You have to.
7354400	7355400	Oh right.
7355400	7361060	You can do diversity, you can watch your cues through pretty much any device that'll do
7361060	7362060	streaming.
7362060	7363820	I use my Playstation 3 for that.
7363820	7365740	It actually works pretty well for that.
7365740	7370700	Hulu doesn't look that great though because it's kind of low resolution, but we've watched
7370700	7373820	a few episodes of The Office that we were missing when we were catching up, you know,
7373820	7379900	all the seasons and stuff, but yeah, it does kind of suck that, now I know what they're
7379900	7383560	saying, well you pay for cable and there's commercials there too, but yeah.
7383560	7391820	But I, you know, I don't need you quite as much as I need, you know, other TV.
7391820	7392820	I guess.
7392820	7396140	It's like stop being greedy about it.
7396140	7399580	Alright well let's move on with some more stories, Dark Sakura.
7399580	7406300	Well in other news, we do have something for the 3DS, Excitebike 3D Classic is going to
7406300	7409640	be offered on the 3DS for free!
7409640	7415100	When the 3DS eShop goes live, this is going to be a part of it.
7415100	7424140	And like I said, it's 3D Excitebike, so you get it in full lenticular motion, but they
7424140	7428620	didn't say where it was going to be for, but it could possibly just be Japan.
7428620	7430740	Here's what's kind of retarded.
7430740	7436540	I don't know if anyone's actually seen a Japanese 3DS, I mean, I have, but in the beginning
7436540	7441100	of their, you know how we have this, you know, OK Go video, well they got this, you know,
7441100	7446580	Mario live music performance thing over there as the free 3D video.
7446580	7452300	And before that actually starts, they have a 3D picture of Super Mario Bros. 1.
7452300	7457100	And the way they show that is exactly how they're doing this.
7457100	7461140	Basically, you know, most of these 8-bit games have different sprite layers.
7461140	7462140	That's all they're doing.
7462140	7464100	Each sprite layer is a different depth.
7464100	7465100	That is it.
7465100	7472260	I was showing it at E3, Xevious was the old 8-bit game and the ground was one sprite layer
7472260	7476300	and that was in the background and then all the other sprites were on top.
7476300	7477900	It was a neat effect to see.
7477900	7481860	I mean, it's cool, but I would not spend very much money.
7481860	7487960	I mean, the game is going to have to be like a true NES classic that I just, I need to
7487960	7489300	have on my DS.
7489300	7490860	Like that's the only way I'm going to buy it again.
7490860	7491860	But see, that's what they're doing.
7491860	7492860	I got burned on the list.
7492860	7498100	They're just, they have an emulator now, obviously, that works with these, I mean, come on, anything
7498100	7501240	can run an NES emulator nowadays.
7501240	7509140	So they have an NES emulator that just spreads out the sprite layers.
7509140	7511880	When homebrew comes out, I'm sure someone will come up with that.
7511880	7513880	It's not that complicated.
7513880	7514880	But you know what they're going to do?
7514880	7518620	They're going to charge you like 4 bucks for each one of those games because people will
7518620	7523020	buy them, even though it's really not worth the effort that they put in to develop this
7523020	7524020	emulator.
7524020	7529660	It would be really nice if, like, they would just give us a kickback because we bought
7529660	7531220	it on Wii Virtual Console.
7531220	7532980	I mean, I know that's not going to happen.
7532980	7534380	I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice?
7534380	7537580	It would be nice, but they don't really, I mean, they have accounts that are tied to
7537580	7541260	the Wii, but it's not an account that you can take everywhere.
7541260	7544300	It's basically just an account that's tied to that console.
7544300	7549700	You know, if they had an actual centralized online community or something like that, then
7549700	7551060	yeah, something like that could happen.
7551060	7554460	Well hey, I see they purchased Mario Brothers on the Wii.
7554460	7555460	Guess what?
7555460	7556460	You get the 3D version for free.
7556460	7561400	Which they really should do because it's like a few kilobytes worth of data.
7561400	7565700	And yeah, I'm sure that emulator really took some time.
7565700	7568500	You just probably ported the one from the Wii over to the DS.
7568500	7573260	Oh fuck, I mean, people have been running NES emulators on the DS forever.
7573260	7576620	I mean, all you'd have to do is just tweak the display so that each sprite layer is a
7576620	7578380	different layer of 3D.
7578380	7581540	I mean, that's not hard.
7581540	7582540	It's not difficult.
7582540	7584300	And it's very minimal.
7584300	7588700	So yeah, that should be free.
7588700	7589700	But it won't be.
7589700	7592180	I mean, after all, how else are these things going to print money?
7592180	7593180	Even just a discount.
7593180	7595360	Even just like a little discount or something.
7595360	7599700	Or maybe like if I get enough Nintendo achievements, I know, right?
7599700	7605580	I could like get one for free, or like, you know, one or two upgrades.
7605580	7606980	That's all they really should be charging for this stuff.
7606980	7608980	Yeah, charge me $0.99.
7608980	7609980	That'd be great.
7609980	7613700	And if I don't own the game at all, then fine, charge me $5.99.
7613700	7616180	Five what the game would have cost, and the extra $0.99 for the 3D.
7616180	7619100	No, it should not even be $6 for an old NES game.
7619100	7622280	I'm sorry, no.
7622280	7624500	Some are worth it, but very few.
7624500	7628240	Some are worth it.
7628240	7631540	But at the same time, I mean, I can go buy the original on cartridge, but sometimes the
7631540	7633660	original cartridges will cost you more than five bucks.
7633660	7635620	Just depends on what game you're talking about.
7635620	7638540	Seriously, especially if you're trying to fill up your Tangen collection.
7638540	7639540	Yeah.
7639540	7641540	Which, by the way, Afterburner is mentioned.
7641540	7645940	And I have your Fantasy Zone, if you didn't know that.
7645940	7646940	Yes, I do.
7646940	7647940	Okay.
7647940	7648940	Yeah, didn't I lend it to you?
7648940	7649940	Yeah, you did.
7649940	7650940	So, just so you know.
7650940	7651940	Okay, cool.
7651940	7660340	As I was mentioning, Afterburner, they did a Tangen one for NES, just thought I'd mention
7660340	7661340	that.
7661340	7664780	Comment in our chatroom on, from ToaGak, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo ripped off
7664780	7666740	a homebrew emulator.
7666740	7668140	Loki?
7668140	7673100	Um, I don't think that they need to, because they've got an emulator for the Wii.
7673100	7674380	They've got all the tech docs they need.
7674380	7679500	They've got an emulator for a Wii, they had cartridges on the Game Boy Advance, or even
7679500	7685980	I think the Game Boy Color, they had NES cartridges.
7685980	7689420	So they've got, I mean, hell, they have an emulator that runs on the Game Boy.
7689420	7692060	It's obviously gonna run on the 3DS.
7692060	7694220	So they have that kind of data there.
7694220	7697580	It's just minimal tweaking to get it to be in 3D.
7697580	7701900	Seriously, it's not any special effects that they're adding or anything.
7701900	7705780	I mean, if it was some Mode 7 games or something like that, that might be a little bit cooler
7705780	7713900	if those were in 3D, because they had a lot of scaling there, but just doing, like, separating
7713900	7718300	the sprite layers is, I'm sorry, it's like child's play stuff.
7718300	7722860	It's just really, people are gonna find it neat, but once again, they're selling you
7722860	7723960	on the gimmick.
7723960	7727220	They're selling you on your memories of these retro games, because they're like, oh my god,
7727220	7731300	Nintendo games, oh, it's in 3D now!
7731300	7737300	Seriously, you're gonna buy into that, and you're just only encouraging them to spend
7737300	7740700	what little effort they will on this stuff.
7740700	7743700	But hey, you know what, if that's what you want, then fine.
7743700	7746820	Because they're not gonna change their ways anytime soon.
7746820	7750600	So whatever, you know, buy what you want.
7750600	7752500	It's my money, I'll spend it how I want.
7752500	7753500	Yeah, pretty much.
7753500	7757580	How much did you pay to import the Japanese 3DS again?
7757580	7758580	I forgot.
7758580	7761420	Could you remind me how much?
7761420	7762580	I liked getting stuff early.
7762580	7764580	I know, I'm just messing with you.
7764580	7765580	And then I sold it.
7765580	7769260	I'm just giving you shit, that is my role on the show, okay?
7769260	7773020	Dark Soccer's role is to be the girl, your role is to be the tech master, and mine is
7773020	7774540	to give the both of you shit.
7774540	7776380	Yeah, but here's the thing.
7776380	7778100	I'm not just a girl.
7778100	7781300	Well, I was gonna say a bitch, but I thought that would be me.
7781300	7782700	I know, that's awesome.
7782700	7788020	I would almost consider selling that 3DS again, just to get rid of it, because I'm not playing
7788020	7789740	anything on it, really, right now.
7789740	7793340	And I have a feeling it's just gonna be collecting dust, like my DS is.
7793340	7797300	And you know, I may just...
7797300	7798300	But what's the point?
7798300	7800300	You know, because I'll probably want a game later on down the road.
7800300	7803740	But you better be...
7803740	7809060	And yeah, when the new Nintendo console comes out, I probably will have to buy it, because
7809060	7811660	it'll be spiffy and new, and I like new things.
7811660	7817660	But I will seriously think about it, I mean, because if they don't have some really awesome
7817660	7822140	games at launch, then count me out.
7822140	7827940	I'll wait until some future versions come out.
7827940	7832380	I'm not gonna be so impulse-crazy nowadays, because it really doesn't get me anything.
7832380	7833380	What?
7833380	7835940	Oh, okay, I got to play Ridge Racer in 3D for a little bit.
7835940	7839540	Yeah, that's cool, but I don't know.
7839540	7842780	It's not that big of a deal.
7842780	7846220	And it all really matters about the cost of that console, because man, that thing's like
7846220	7849900	three hundred dollars plus a hundred dollars for the controller.
7849900	7852540	Nope.
7852540	7853540	Or maybe.
7853540	7857980	Alright, let's move on with some, what, hacking news, right?
7857980	7861860	Yeah, the PlayStation Network's not the only thing that's being hacked.
7861860	7868380	Of course, there's kind of been a struggle between hackers creating custom firmwares
7868380	7874820	for the drives of the consoles, and then of course Microsoft in updating those.
7874820	7878180	They have the new firmware that's gonna be coming out, or the new dashboard update that's
7878180	7885860	gonna kind of tweak the disks as well as enabling what they call AP 2.5 on all the games.
7885860	7891620	It's basically a new copy protection that they have right now on a couple of the Call
7891620	7896700	of Duty games, and on Assassin's Creed and actually some of the newer games.
7896700	7899980	Of course, all that stuff can be patched.
7899980	7905020	But there's some interesting things coming out, and some of this almost similar to the
7905020	7906420	PlayStation 3.
7906420	7913460	For example, there is a device coming out called the Xbox, or the X360 key.
7913460	7917780	It'll allow you to play any game from a USB drive.
7917780	7922940	And what it's basically gonna be, it's gonna be a device that connects in between your
7922940	7928300	Xbox 360, the SATA connection that's on there, and the DVD drive.
7928300	7934100	And it will allow it to emulate the actual DVD drive itself, so make it think that it's
7934100	7940700	playing disks off the drive when it's actually playing ISOs off a USB drive or a hard drive.
7940700	7942980	And actually the system has Linux running on it.
7942980	7946060	It's fully upgradeable.
7946060	7953400	And I guess it's gonna have protection against whatever the AP 25 protection emulation is
7953400	7955480	well built in there.
7955480	7960260	No word on when it's coming out yet, but I've seen initial costs on it, it's 120 bucks.
7960260	7963260	So I guess we'll have to see if this actually works out and stuff.
7963260	7968080	But if that's the case though, it will actually allow you to do all that without having to
7968080	7969080	mod your system.
7969080	7972860	Of course, you'll still have to open it up.
7972860	7978180	And then of course, if that's not your way to go, the Commodore Forever, they announced
7978180	7985260	that they're gonna have a new iXtreme LT firmware for all drives, including Commodore
7985260	7986260	Forever.
7986260	7988420	You're gonna be able to put Gios on your 360?
7988420	7989540	No you're not.
7989540	7991340	It's the hacking group, Commodore Forever.
7991340	7992340	Play Last Ninja?
7992340	7996020	They've been working on firmwares for the drives for a long time.
7996020	8001900	They say their LT 2.0 supports the XG-D3, which is the new disk format that Microsoft's
8001900	8004300	putting out to gain that extra one gig.
8004300	8012300	And also the slim, light-on 0225 drive, which was unhackable as of right now.
8012300	8017420	So apparently that will allow you to bypass all this different protection and allow you
8017420	8018420	to flash your drives.
8018420	8021180	And it's supposed to be untraceable as of right now.
8021180	8027840	And I know the light touch stuff has been pretty stealthy as far as live goes, so that's
8027840	8028840	kind of interesting.
8028840	8036960	And the last thing was another device called Xbox 360 Optical Drive Emulation.
8036960	8044620	And it's an emulator that will be a little bit similar to the 360 key, whereas a device
8044620	8052740	set will make it look like it's running actual disks when it's running stuff off of a hard
8052740	8054780	drive.
8054780	8055780	Very interesting.
8055780	8062980	A lot of this stuff can be patched out with one firmware update, but some of this, especially
8062980	8069380	with the custom firmwares for the disk drives, it's back and forth with them.
8069380	8073580	And actually the new firmware that's coming out, if you do have a flash device right now,
8073580	8077460	what it's going to do is it's going to flash it back to stock, and then it's going to copy
8077460	8082140	protect it, I guess, so that you can't adjust the firmware that's on your drive.
8082140	8086540	So that's kind of interesting.
8086540	8091100	So how long before we're emulating the actual Xbox 360, like on our PCs?
8091100	8097460	A long time, because we're talking like multi-core processors and emulating that stuff.
8097460	8102300	It's going to take a long time before we're able to do that, a few years.
8102300	8104220	All right.
8104220	8111220	Well let's move on with some more gaming news, and this one has to do with the iPhone.
8111220	8116900	And apparently, this is something I actually did a double take, and I was like, what is
8116900	8119100	this being posted in our show roll thread for?
8119100	8121460	Haven't we reported on this before?
8121460	8123420	Well we have, but we haven't.
8123420	8127620	And what I mean is, this is yet another game that has appeared on the iTunes app store
8127620	8130220	that was copied off of a flash game.
8130220	8133460	The game is called Achilles Defense.
8133460	8141180	It was available on the iTunes store by, they're based in Hanoi, Vietnam, PTT Solution.
8141180	8145780	It is a ripoff of Ironhide's Clash of the Olympians, Ironhide Game Studio, excuse me,
8145780	8148060	Clash of the Olympians.
8148060	8153020	The only difference is, Ironhide's game has three characters, PTT's app has one.
8153020	8157340	The music, the artwork, the gameplay, it is all the same.
8157340	8159860	Clash of the Olympians came out in August of last year.
8159860	8163420	You can play that online at ironhidegames.com.
8163420	8165940	Achilles Defense came out on April 18th.
8165940	8171300	It was offered for free, and now it's down to, I'm sorry, up to a 99% price.
8171300	8177140	Of course, some people are review spamming that, but needless to say, it's there.
8177140	8178740	It's been on the app store.
8178740	8180700	How does Apple prevent this?
8180700	8184820	I mean, because they don't really screen the content of games.
8184820	8185820	I don't know.
8185820	8188940	Like, obviously this news is very sad to that development company who, you know, had the
8188940	8190420	game out there for free that somebody totally ripped off.
8190420	8192100	Did you see the Mario ripoff on there too?
8192100	8194980	Yeah, I mean, that was the other, I think, thing that had come out before.
8194980	8201640	There's a Mario ripoff, and then there was that other game too that had come out, so.
8201640	8206300	The blocks cometh, and then there was also some bunny game, bunny fighting game.
8206300	8209580	That was less of a ripoff and more of, like, a rights issue.
8209580	8213300	Who owned the rights to it and stuff, but the other one was a complete ripoff.
8213300	8219980	For the record, Ironhide is pissed, and they wrote Apple to complain, and they want gamers
8219980	8224060	to help assist them by lodging their own complaints in the game's comment space.
8224060	8226500	So they're encouraging people to downvote this thing.
8226500	8231020	Now it is the weekend, so I don't know what's gonna happen, but come Monday I'm sure it's,
8231020	8234060	you know, gonna get crazy.
8234060	8238100	And maybe Apple will pull it down, I don't know.
8238100	8239100	So.
8239100	8240100	Alright.
8240100	8241100	Anyhow.
8241100	8244580	Uh, let's move on to the mailbag.
8244580	8247340	Oh, and boy, we've got a fun one this week.
8247340	8251700	Because Dark Soccer got a taco before the show started, and she was only getting that
8251700	8253140	taco if we got ten emails.
8253140	8254140	But you got more than that.
8254140	8255140	You got more than that.
8255140	8257500	Now, I don't know if she's reading every single one.
8257500	8258580	I'm doubting that, right?
8258580	8259580	No, I'm not.
8259580	8265500	Pretty much anything that's repeating the emails that Sony sent out for PSN, and our
8265500	8268540	rehashes of things we've already discussed, I'm not reading them.
8268540	8270940	Let me give you a super tip if you want to email the show.
8270940	8273820	Remember, the show is about where every gamer has a voice.
8273820	8277220	And sometimes people want to email us to clue us into news and things that are going on,
8277220	8280620	which is fine, especially because sometimes we miss those things, they fall off the radar,
8280620	8284660	like the case of the Marvel Universe thing earlier in the show, and Tigerclaw got that
8284660	8285920	to our attention via Twitter.
8285920	8290180	But if everybody's talking about it, like the PSN thing, we're probably going to cover
8290180	8291520	it in the show.
8291520	8294220	We want to know your thoughts.
8294220	8295700	Don't just regurgitate the news.
8295700	8297020	Tell us what you think.
8297020	8301700	A better email will tell us about what you plan to do because of the Sony hack, which
8301700	8303940	I imagine we're going to get to in some of these emails.
8303940	8307660	Some of them were that they were also repeat emailers, and I'm trying to give new people
8307660	8308660	attention too.
8308660	8309660	Sure.
8309660	8310660	Absolutely.
8310660	8311660	Absolutely.
8311660	8312660	As it is.
8312660	8315340	If you've had a lot of emails, if your voice has been heard a lot, don't be butthurt that
8315340	8316900	we do some other people tonight.
8316900	8319220	Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
8319220	8320220	I'm reading eleven of them.
8320220	8321220	Oh shit.
8321220	8322220	All right.
8322220	8323220	Well, here we go then.
8323220	8324220	Okay.
8324220	8325220	This one.
8325220	8326220	It's taco time.
8326220	8329980	Join our valiant chef, Dark Sakura, on her quest to defeat the evil Montezuma and his
8329980	8330980	army of veggies.
8330980	8335180	Will our hero be able to stop a digestive disaster and create the perfect taco?
8335180	8336340	With your help she can.
8336340	8337460	Only for Xbox 360.
8337460	8340300	Pre-order today and receive an official taco time salsa spoon.
8340300	8341300	All right.
8341300	8342940	I know this has been terribly lame, but I couldn't resist.
8342940	8345860	I hope you at least get a chuckle out of this.
8345860	8348620	I've been a long time listener, but this is my first time writing in.
8348620	8353020	You guys helped me survive my boring job, so keep up the gaming news and crazy tangents.
8353020	8354540	Feed Jamie tacos now.
8354540	8355540	That's from Panaxium.
8355540	8356540	Fine.
8356540	8357540	We fed her.
8357540	8358540	And he sent me a picture.
8358540	8359820	Be quiet.
8359820	8360820	Taco time.
8360820	8361820	Oh, this is great.
8361820	8363080	Oh, that's awesome.
8363080	8367700	They actually put your picture in the little chef's hat on taco time.
8367700	8369660	This is actually a pretty decent photo shopping.
8369660	8370660	I'm saving it.
8370660	8373220	This is the orange launch radio website thingy.
8373220	8376460	We have the super secret email now, so we stopped getting the goatee pictures.
8376460	8377460	I'll let you do that, Rob.
8377460	8378460	Well, I don't.
8378460	8379460	All right.
8379460	8380460	Fine.
8380460	8381460	I'll look it up.
8381460	8382460	I'll take care of it.
8382460	8383460	Forward it to me so I do it.
8383460	8384460	Okay.
8384460	8385460	I'll take care of it later.
8385460	8386460	Don't worry.
8386460	8387460	I downloaded it.
8387460	8388460	Okay.
8388460	8389460	This one.
8389460	8391940	Dear OLR, it's been a while since I last emailed you guys.
8391940	8393100	I also miss listening live.
8393100	8395100	I really need to get back into the habit of doing that.
8395100	8396100	Yes, you do.
8396100	8400980	Anyways, I just got through with changing pretty much all of my passwords on multiple
8400980	8406420	sites as well as notifying my bank of the PSN intrusion compromising my account.
8406420	8409100	Honestly, this has been a huge wakeup call for me.
8409100	8413420	Never before have I been this concerned about my personal information on the internet.
8413420	8417440	Sony's failure to protect my privacy and resolve this issue as quickly as possible really has
8417440	8421420	me thinking twice about my future purchases on the PSN.
8421420	8425380	I have heard of PSN cards like you buy in the stores, sort of like the Xbox Live or
8425380	8426700	iTunes cards.
8426700	8429380	That seems like a safer route to go.
8429380	8433860	On a lighter note, have any of you checked out Sonic Colors for the Wii?
8433860	8437500	Before Sonic Generations comes out, I highly recommend that you don't miss out on this
8437500	8438500	game.
8438500	8441620	Actually, that's the one I was wanting to get, but we loaned out our Wii.
8441620	8442620	It's really a lot of fun.
8442620	8443620	Great soundtrack as well.
8443620	8447580	Sega focused a lot more on the game design and gameplay rather than story this time around.
8447580	8453540	But I have no issue there other than rolling my eyes at some of the cheesy lines in the
8453540	8454540	cut scenes.
8454540	8455540	So that's all for now.
8455540	8456540	Thanks for reading Ospher.
8456540	8460180	P.S. how about that Xbox 360 OLR autographed faceplate?
8460180	8461180	Ah, fuck.
8461180	8464380	You know, I just actually found a bunch of faceplates.
8464380	8466560	So, okay.
8466560	8471740	I'm going to email you back with my real email so that you can email me and we'll work on
8471740	8472740	it, okay?
8472740	8475740	Hello there, OrangeLones Radio.
8475740	8480140	I feel compelled to take the time out of my busy night to write you, I said busy, I meant
8480140	8484900	busy, night to write you this email as the three of you on occasion entertain the masses.
8484900	8490460	I found your show while being very bored at work on Stitcher today because at 1330 hours
8490460	8495060	I was actually going through the mini podcast and I found yours to be the most enjoyable.
8495060	8498580	To be honest, I never really listened to any type of podcast.
8498580	8503040	I was bored of my music mixes on my Blackberry and wanted to hear people talk about topics
8503040	8504140	I enjoy.
8504140	8508780	And yes, after listening I was heavily informed about what's what in gaming and not to mention
8508780	8510980	walked away with a craving of tacos.
8510980	8514820	I will be subscribing via iTunes but sadly not too many of my friends are gamers so I
8514820	8520420	don't really have anyone to tell as I work executive protection and the three friends
8520420	8523340	I would rather talk about weapon calibers.
8523340	8528540	But I will be trying to tune in while you are live on Sundays from now on so thanks
8528540	8529540	for the great podcast.
8529540	8532640	I love it and I found something new to look forward to at the end of the week.
8532640	8533640	Thank you all.
8533640	8534640	Shattered Hawk.
8534640	8535640	P.S.
8535640	8536840	DarkSark, if you like tacos you should try Navajo tacos.
8536840	8542260	Your head will explode from the pure deliciousness of this dish.
8542260	8544380	Well if I can find them.
8544380	8545380	Sounds good.
8545380	8546380	I love tacos.
8546380	8547380	Is that a chain or is that a type of taco?
8547380	8548700	I don't know.
8548700	8549700	We need more.
8549700	8552860	We need either a recipe or we need a FedEx box to show up at the house.
8552860	8553860	More info.
8553860	8554860	Give us the 411.
8554860	8556580	Ah, you see what I did there.
8556580	8558580	I'm clever.
8558580	8559580	Nice.
8559580	8561060	Okay.
8561060	8567080	I was wondering regarding the PSN hack slash outage, hack slash, if the possible phishing
8567080	8574060	email I wrote about at the end of May had anything in relation to the intrusion.
8574060	8578820	The email did seem upon reflection fairly legitimate with no questions or warnings that
8578820	8582980	you had to click through the link which I left untouched to enter personal information.
8582980	8585780	Only the address it was sent from seemed suspect.
8585780	8591420	Secondly I noticed the latest issue of Games Magazine July 2011 has a feature story on
8591420	8595820	the selling of harmonics and the suspension of Guitar Hero as well as the reviewers take
8595820	8598340	on the Dead Space 2 ad controversy.
8598340	8602860	This is of course months old news, but to be fair, Games is not intended as a video
8602860	8603860	game news source.
8603860	8608800	It is first and foremost a magazine of crossword and logic puzzles with articles about board
8608800	8612620	games and within the last decade or so of video games as well with issues likely being
8612620	8615460	put together months before being published.
8615460	8617900	July issue arriving in late April.
8617900	8623180	I enjoy games for what it is, but wonder about your take on the ultra casual gaming press.
8623180	8630460	And this comes from Robert M. Um, I don't really pay attention to it so, I don't know.
8630460	8637220	I finally stopped getting a lot of those news release emails, Zynga farted.
8637220	8638860	You know, that type of thing.
8638860	8640540	I kind of don't care.
8640540	8642900	I mean, if I want to play-
8642900	8648220	It's so hard because I don't read a lot of that stuff, you know, and sometimes we're
8648220	8649220	challenged with that.
8649220	8651420	We have to put ourselves in other people's shoes.
8651420	8658660	I always find it fascinating to kind of see how, not so much maybe the casual gaming press
8658660	8661740	or whatever, but like the mass media quote unquote reports on gaming.
8661740	8666400	Like there was a local channel here that reported on the whole PlayStation Network breach because
8666400	8668620	it was the top story on the day that it happened.
8668620	8674340	It let off the 11 o'clock news and they twisted it to turn into a parents need to be monitoring
8674340	8679140	what their children do type of story, which yes, I understand they should, but it seemed
8679140	8681620	like, I don't know, it got a little preachy to me.
8681620	8682940	Like it wasn't really about the hack.
8682940	8686960	It was more about parents watch what your kids do because these consoles in your living
8686960	8689460	room are stealing credit cards when you're not looking.
8689460	8693860	And I just felt like it didn't really represent the story, but I expect no less from the mass
8693860	8694860	media.
8694860	8696420	You know what I mean?
8696420	8702200	So I guess that's my unsolicited take on it.
8702200	8706500	By the way, completely random aside, but it totally ties into this email.
8706500	8714380	I did get a last minute story submission and it has to do with speaking of kind of casual
8714380	8715460	game news sites.
8715460	8716460	I don't know.
8716460	8719420	I don't really consider, especially after something that happened this week.
8719420	8721300	I don't want to get into the details of it.
8721300	8722300	Follow me on Twitter.
8722300	8723680	There's my plug.
8723680	8725180	There's more on it there.
8725180	8729800	But a certain website and UGO, I'll tell you, a big gaming website that I like to say this
8729800	8734300	week stands for Ignorant Gaming News, is merging with UGO apparently.
8734300	8735940	That's Depurr Report.
8735940	8739100	And it's going to spin off from Newscore.
8739100	8740100	Yeah.
8740100	8745180	So I guess they're going to merge and continue to publish worthless stories.
8745180	8747700	Okay.
8747700	8750180	So is it my turn?
8750180	8751180	Yes.
8751180	8752180	Sorry.
8752180	8753180	Okay.
8753180	8754180	Hello.
8754180	8757060	I'm not going to read your first email, first or second email, but I'm going to tell you
8757060	8761740	if you are going to pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.
8761740	8762900	Apostrophes are for possessives.
8762900	8763900	The end.
8763900	8764900	Okay.
8764900	8765900	Now I'll read it.
8765900	8766900	Hello all.
8766900	8767900	First of all, I have to say I'm loving the show.
8767900	8772540	Second, I want to hear, I want to get Jamie her taco, so I thought I should write to you
8772540	8773540	guys.
8773540	8774540	My taco was delicious.
8774540	8775540	Thank you.
8775540	8776540	Here's my question.
8776540	8778020	I'm a hardcore MMO player.
8778020	8782680	Blizzard has its firm grasp on my wallet for six years and I've recently dabbled a bit
8782680	8784820	in playing Rift alongside WoW.
8784820	8788420	The thing is, I think Rift made me want to play WoW again, and I always wondered why
8788420	8789420	that was.
8789420	8790420	Any ideas?
8790420	8793420	Maybe because it made you really appreciate World of Warcraft?
8793420	8794420	Maybe?
8794420	8797180	Also, there are lots of new MMOs being released.
8797180	8801340	Terra Online, which I like to call Chicks with Gigantic Boobs MMO.
8801340	8803020	The Old Republic and The Secret World.
8803020	8804020	Do I want to play them?
8804020	8805020	Yes.
8805020	8807780	I actually want to play all of them, but I know most will probably disappoint me.
8807780	8811580	In reality, I'll probably just stick with the two MMOs, but yes, here's my real question.
8811580	8814980	Finally, do you think it's possible to juggle two MMOs at the same time?
8814980	8818620	Keep up the good show, and I hope that you get your tacos, Jamie.
8818620	8819620	Love, Cyl.
8819620	8822020	Hey, it was our guest from Hoard House this week.
8822020	8823020	Yes.
8823020	8824300	You know what?
8824300	8826300	I feel bad now correcting.
8826300	8827300	You bitch.
8827300	8829020	No, I'm just kidding.
8829020	8830900	See, I said that was your role on the show.
8830900	8832420	But I do that to everybody.
8832420	8833420	So, much love.
8833420	8834420	Okay.
8834420	8839980	So, first of all, I actually want to go back and play Star Trek Online while I'm playing
8839980	8842260	well, but I can't afford the two together right now.
8842260	8847900	That's the hardest thing, is that trying to pay for two is usually the hardest thing to
8847900	8848900	play two.
8848900	8854040	I've seen a lot of people juggle a freemium in a premium, especially like Guild Wars types
8854040	8855040	of things.
8855040	8856040	That gets juggled a lot.
8856040	8860620	Facebook games, if you think about it to some extent, are MMOs, kind of, I don't know.
8860620	8862380	So can you?
8862380	8863380	Of course you can.
8863380	8866180	There's lots of people that play two MMOs at once.
8866180	8870260	When I was on Star Trek Online, I played Ragnarok Online on a free server.
8870260	8873420	So I was keeping up with two MMOs, no problem.
8873420	8876300	I mean, most of the time it was just, oh, which one are my friends hanging out on?
8876300	8877620	Well, I'll go play this one right now.
8877620	8881300	Okay, well, my guild's all asleep because I'm in America and they're not.
8881300	8888180	So I suppose a lot of it just kind of depends too on how casual or hardcore are you into
8888180	8889180	the games.
8889180	8892620	Like, if you're hardcore into WoW, you don't have time for a lot else.
8892620	8897940	If you're raiding several nights a week for several hours at a time, you're probably lucky
8897940	8900220	if you're fitting in console games in your downtime.
8900220	8904660	You know, you can't, your life can't be filled with video games 24-7 and I think, you know,
8904660	8907660	obviously the stuff from earlier tonight kind of proves that.
8907660	8911340	There's a whole real world out there with news and everything.
8911340	8917180	You know, so, but if you're more of the casual type, you don't really tie yourself down to
8917180	8918180	the games.
8918180	8922140	You get to play on kind of like an as-you-want basis, absolutely there's room for two.
8922140	8923140	Why not?
8923140	8928460	Hell, some people invested like, what, a hundred hours plus into a game like Oblivion.
8928460	8930900	That's almost as big of an investment as an MMO.
8930900	8935700	Well, it's, I'll tell you what's kind of hard is I've been playing Portal 2 and WoW together.
8935700	8940300	I mean, not at, clearly not at the same time, but I mean, both are time consuming, it really
8940300	8941300	just depends.
8941300	8942300	Next email.
8942300	8947340	Hey y'all, I was listening to OLR about the PSN network going down and the guy who was
8947340	8950500	writing in thought that Anonymous did it.
8950500	8953860	I personally don't think it was them because they said they had realized it wouldn't hurt
8953860	8957620	the people they were trying to stand up for, which is a point that I made.
8957620	8961500	It sounds to me like someone heard that Anonymous was doing this and decided to take advantage
8961500	8965420	of having an obvious patsy and cover their own tracks.
8965420	8969140	These guys seem to focus mainly on taking down websites and I've never heard of Anonymous
8969140	8971020	actually stealing stuff.
8971020	8975240	I mean, I guess it's possible, but it just doesn't sound right.
8975240	8979860	These are the same people who defended that Casey Heinz kid who was bullied.
8979860	8981860	They sound like well-meaning folk.
8981860	8983740	It just doesn't seem like them to me.
8983740	8987500	Also about the hacking emails, I got one from Best Buy 2 saying that their email list had
8987500	8988580	been stolen.
8988580	8990900	It just seems to be going around right now and that's from Holly D.
8990900	8995740	Wow, that's another Hoard House listener I recognize.
8995740	8999040	Yeah, I don't know.
8999040	9003380	It's going to be interesting to see, especially with so many people involved, what the effect
9003380	9007780	on the hackers could be because at the end of the day, the hackers are the ones to blame,
9007780	9008780	right?
9008780	9009780	Yeah.
9009780	9013940	Although Sony does share their part in the accountability.
9013940	9014940	Yes.
9014940	9016740	They had...
9016740	9020460	Sony needs to show what they're really doing to stop the hackers other than, well, our
9020460	9024040	system is hack proof, inviting them in the front door, you know?
9024040	9026980	Don't talk out of your ass.
9026980	9028940	Okay.
9028940	9033100	If any, please answer in comments or e- what the hell is this?
9033100	9036100	Oh no, this is crap email.
9036100	9037100	Sorry.
9037100	9038100	Oh, is it spam?
9038100	9039100	Yeah.
9039100	9044020	Oh, we have one from Anime Jam Session podcast crew, which would be our buddy Ranma.
9044020	9045020	Skip it.
9045020	9046020	I'm just kidding.
9046020	9047020	I'm kidding.
9047020	9050140	Greetings one and all, DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session here.
9050140	9053820	In between downtime and edits for the site and podcasting and everything else, I have
9053820	9055340	found time to send an email.
9055340	9058420	I do have something to discuss and I will get straight to the point.
9058420	9063500	Rob, you squeaked with delight over the revival of the Commodore 64 and Loki thought it was
9063500	9064500	crazy.
9064500	9065500	I do have your back on this.
9065500	9071740	I grew up with the C64, but instead of Tandy, Radio Shack, TRS-80, MC-10, and Color Computer
9071740	9072740	3 for me.
9072740	9074980	I had one of those too.
9074980	9078100	From reading the specs and design build of it, I can justify the cost, especially the
9078100	9079100	ultimate.
9079100	9083100	I can tell you right now that the parts alone would run about $300 to $350 and probably
9083100	9087020	another $200 for the case itself, since it's going to be made from the original materials,
9087020	9090420	not the soft, cheap plastic crap, so Loki, stop hatin'.
9090420	9091420	That's it.
9091420	9092420	Time for me to get back to work here.
9092420	9094820	The monkeys are flinging their poo at me, duck.
9094820	9095940	Take care and stay black.
9095940	9097860	Okay, now the joke is officially dead.
9097860	9101820	This email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, a podcast dedicated to anime cons,
9101820	9104580	conventions, pop culture, and everything in between.
9104580	9107220	Guaranteed podcasts, derailing, or your money back.
9107220	9110380	Check it out at www.animeshamsession.com.
9110380	9111380	Also on iTunes.
9111380	9112540	Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.
9112540	9115860	Could you read that part again that says, to Loki, stop hating?
9115860	9117840	Stop hatin'!
9117840	9120880	That's why he's on the show, is to hate.
9120880	9123240	He's our resident hater.
9123240	9124940	Hopefully he's playing Portal right now.
9124940	9126580	Yeah, well, Portal sucks.
9126580	9127820	Oh wait, no it doesn't.
9127820	9128820	I got nothin'.
9128820	9133140	Hey, O.L.R. crew, long time podcast listener, first time writer.
9133140	9136600	There have been many times that I have almost written in to comment on this, but never really
9136600	9138220	felt compelled to until now.
9138220	9139580	My reason for writing is twofold.
9139580	9141980	One, most importantly, free tacos for Dark Sakura.
9141980	9143700	I love you.
9143700	9146180	Hopefully this email will get to that magic number ten.
9146180	9148180	You're up there on the list.
9148180	9149780	Two, Rob, please say it loud the following.
9149780	9150780	Okay, ready?
9150780	9153740	Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery.
9153740	9157060	Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery and give half to Rob.
9157060	9160860	I'm requesting this because obviously Rob is a prophet given his prediction of the PSN
9160860	9163540	outage being a bigger deal than initially reported.
9163540	9165500	I was listening to the podcast last week.
9165500	9169620	On the same day, Sony said, oh, and by the way, you know all that sensitive data we made
9169620	9172260	you give us to play our games and use our services?
9172260	9176700	Yeah, we just put a Furby on guard to watch security, and I guess the battery just ran
9176700	9177700	out.
9177700	9183700	So, normally if anything was up, that little sumbitch would, that little sumbitch would
9183700	9190980	start talking all kinds of crazy stuff like, mew, wow.
9190980	9193420	But don't worry, everyone, we're going to put in a new battery.
9193420	9198660	In the meantime, just watch all your credit card info and change all your passwords.
9198660	9199660	We cool, dog?
9199660	9201240	Yeah, we cool.
9201240	9205380	I'm sure this topic has been beaten into the ground, so you can leave it at that.
9205380	9207560	Beards Whiskey and Rock and Roll, Beardy McWhiskey.
9207560	9208560	I like Beardy McWhiskey.
9208560	9210560	Is he Canadian?
9210560	9214820	I don't know, but I want him to send me some whiskey and send me the good stuff.
9214820	9215820	Send me the beard.
9215820	9216820	Just kidding.
9216820	9220140	You would not be able to, Alan can rock the beard.
9220140	9221140	Alan can rock the beard.
9221140	9222140	I don't think you can rock the beard.
9222140	9223140	No, I can't rock the beard.
9223140	9224140	You've got that baby face.
9224140	9225140	Aw.
9225140	9226140	Aw.
9226140	9229340	Then again, I didn't think Dan could rock a beard, but now he's got the goatee of doom.
9229340	9230340	You don't know.
9230340	9233340	One of these days I'm just going to shave my head and then I'll have the beard and we'll
9233340	9234340	see what happens.
9234340	9235340	That's too lumpy.
9235340	9237900	But I'm not going to have a choice soon enough.
9237900	9240460	You could totally pull a Shatner and get, like, the fake toupee.
9240460	9241460	No, I'm not.
9241460	9242460	We'll get you a Tribble!
9242460	9243460	In hell.
9243460	9247740	And then we can pop you on the head and go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
9247740	9249720	Rob Hearts.
9249720	9250720	Next email.
9250720	9251720	Okay.
9251720	9252720	Hi O.L.R.
9252720	9253720	It's spaznator again.
9253720	9256460	Yes, spaznator was one of the ones who sent me the big email from Sony, but this is the
9256460	9258440	part of it that I'm going to read.
9258440	9259440	Hi O.L.R.
9259440	9260440	It's spaznator again.
9260440	9263660	Sorry for the second email, but I have a question for you regarding the PSN press release from
9263660	9264660	4.30.
9264660	9268660	The wording in one section has me a little confused. It states as follows.
9268660	9276660	The company also expedited an already planned move of the system to a new data center in a different location that has been under construction and development for several months.
9276660	9286660	In addition, PS3 will have a forced system software update that will require all registered PlayStation Network users to change their account passwords before being able to sign into the service.
9286660	9298660	As an added layer of security, the passwords can only be changed on the same PS3 in which that account was activated or through validated email confirmation, a critical step to further protect customer data.
9298660	9311660	When they say that the password can only be changed on the same PS3 in which the account was activated, do they mean the PS3 which you initially created the account or if you for the sake of this email are on your fourth PS3 and had previously successfully activated your account for the current PS3?
9311660	9323660	Nope, the original one, but you'll be able to do it through email as well. If your original one died or whatever, you replaced it with a slim, whatever you did, you're not screwed as long as you can still log into the email account that you use for PlayStation Network.
9323660	9334660	I ask this because I have two PSN accounts, spasnator and movie underscore profile, and neither account were initially created on my current PS3 although I've had these profiles on my PS3 since Sony sent it to me.
9334660	9346660	With one profile, the email address is current, up to date, and easily accessible, but for the other, I still have the old Final Fantasy XI slash POL, I guess that's Play Online, email address associated with it.
9346660	9354660	And I haven't used that in a couple of years. See, I'm both confused and concerned. Could you please enlighten me on this issue? Thank you in advance.
9354660	9358660	I think you can actually still get into your Play Online email. You should be able to.
9358660	9367660	Sony SOE was not affected. They went down for a little bit, but their information was fine, and that would include Play Online.
9367660	9380660	Okay, well, we're almost done. Another one from Robert M. From what footage I've seen of Portal 2, how would you say it's fair to compare the ambiance to that of Bioshock? Haven't played either yet, but hope too soon.
9380660	9385660	Bioshock is a little bit more doom and gloom, ominous?
9385660	9390660	Bioshock strikes me as a little more steampunk, whereas Portal's just a little more...
9390660	9395660	And it's a little bit more on the psychological horror. But Portal is the...
9395660	9399660	It's definitely like Science Lab from old to new. I don't know how else to describe it.
9399660	9401660	With that quirky humor.
9401660	9406660	Bioshock, you know, keep in mind there's blood in Bioshock, and there's not in Portal, and it really does make a difference.
9406660	9408660	Portal is really more of a puzzle game.
9408660	9411660	Yes, you can die in Portal, but you don't die in, like, gruesome ways.
9411660	9413660	No, more like you drown or get shot.
9413660	9414660	Yeah.
9414660	9423660	And if you think about it, Mario only, you know, he dies from drowning in water or falling off a cliff, you know.
9423660	9428660	Characters die in games, but sometimes it's violent and sometimes it's not. So...
9428660	9430660	That is finally it!
9430660	9432660	That's it?
9432660	9433660	Yarp.
9433660	9434660	Alrighty.
9434660	9435660	I read 11 emails.
9435660	9441660	Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com. Send us more emails, give us things to talk about.
9441660	9446660	Sorry, no food incentive for next week, but we'll think of something in the future. Maybe we'll have a special week.
9446660	9450660	But this time, Darsaka's buying me something, okay? That's all I'm saying.
9450660	9456660	I want tacos. I want Pinkberry. Send 10 emails so I can get Pinkberry. That's what I want.
9456660	9460660	Of course, everybody knows tacos, but not everybody understands Pinkberry.
9460660	9463660	Pinkberry's... Oh, wait, we got one last minute email.
9463660	9465660	And it's short, so I'll read it.
9465660	9466660	Okay, fine.
9466660	9472660	Hey guys, I just wanted to chime in so Jamie could get some tacos. I did not get tacos. I got taco, but it was a big taco.
9472660	9476660	That was her request, too. I asked her what she wanted and she said she wants a fish taco.
9476660	9477660	Yes.
9477660	9478660	Heh heh heh heh.
9478660	9480660	Fish tacos are great.
9480660	9481660	Heh heh heh heh.
9481660	9489660	What is likely one of the main console developers would cease to exist and what is the likelihood new console developers could enter the market?
9489660	9495660	Thanks guys for a great show as always. Hope Jamie gets tacos till her tummy explodes. I love your rants and very logical points of view, Loki.
9495660	9498660	This message brought to you by typing on a PSP.
9498660	9501660	Sucks! Thanks again, guys. Blade 3.
9501660	9504660	Sorry, what was the question out of that, too? A console developer?
9504660	9509660	What is the likelihood that a main console developer would cease to exist and what is the likelihood that a new console developer could come in?
9509660	9513660	Now, I'm gonna go back and use, um, Sega.
9513660	9515660	Okay, we still have Sega.
9515660	9517660	Or is it Sammy Sega now?
9517660	9522660	But they did stop developing consoles.
9522660	9527660	They're still around, but we don't have them as a console developer anymore.
9527660	9533660	That's a really good question. Um, I don't think it's gonna happen right now.
9533660	9534660	Coleco's gone.
9534660	9538660	Well, yeah, no, and NEC did the TurboGrafx, right?
9538660	9539660	Atari.
9539660	9540660	But NEC is still around.
9540660	9543660	Right, all these companies are still around, but they don't have consoles anymore.
9543660	9544660	Yeah.
9544660	9552660	Um, well, there's also, you could go minor. You could say Philips had the CDi, Apple had the Pippin.
9552660	9553660	Magnavox.
9553660	9554660	You know, none of these really made a splash, but they did exist.
9554660	9557660	Um, eww, this is really hard.
9557660	9567660	I think quite likely, because of the ones out now, the real newcomers would be Sony and Microsoft.
9567660	9568660	And Apple.
9568660	9569660	And Apple.
9569660	9576660	I still say the i-blank is a gaming device, and that's kind of where, I don't know, a lot of portables going.
9576660	9585660	Um, you know, the thing is, as far as someone exiting, despite the news we've been talking about this week,
9585660	9589660	when it comes to the pure sales, none of the systems have been doing terribly.
9589660	9591660	None of them have tanked.
9591660	9592660	No.
9592660	9598660	And that's usually why a console, you know, why a company disappears, because they release a console that just tanks.
9598660	9599660	And that really hasn't happened.
9599660	9600660	But we really have our big three.
9600660	9601660	Yeah.
9601660	9609660	And two of our big three are newcomers within the last 15 years?
9609660	9611660	PlayStation's about 15 years old, so yeah.
9611660	9612660	Yeah.
9612660	9613660	A little over 50.
9613660	9616660	That came out in 94, or 95.
9616660	9628660	But it was, Sony's additions, well, contributions to the console market, they did the SNES's sound processor.
9628660	9634660	I just, I think it's too much for a fourth person to come in, but I think if it's going to be anyone, it's going to be Apple.
9634660	9642660	I think they're going to try to sneak their stuff onto your TV through Apple TV and all this stuff, more so than they already have.
9642660	9645660	And I don't think it's that Apple's really trying to get into gaming.
9645660	9649660	Apple's just in it to make money.
9649660	9650660	So we'll see.
9650660	9653660	But as far as one of the other three going away, I don't think so.
9653660	9657660	One of them's going to have to release a real stinker for that to happen.
9657660	9660660	And I don't see any of them as particularly vulnerable right now.
9660660	9670660	But obviously if Nintendo's going a completely different direction with this console, could be a risky move, especially since 3DS didn't go up to expectations.
9670660	9672660	But I don't think the 3DS is doing terribly.
9672660	9675660	It's not doing enough where it's going to bankrupt the company.
9675660	9676660	Yet, anyway.
9676660	9678660	Well that was actually, I think, a really good email.
9678660	9682660	Thank you for contributing.
9682660	9684660	MegaBoyX in our chatroom says, screw Apple.
9684660	9686660	I think that's what a lot of people say.
9686660	9689660	I think you just mean facts are facts.
9689660	9693660	iPhone, iPads, iPods, all that shit sells really well.
9693660	9695660	And games are available on all of them.
9695660	9700660	Enough so that Nintendo has had to comment on it and kind of dog the competition.
9700660	9703660	So, they are a player.
9703660	9704660	No.
9704660	9706660	Alright, that's it for the email bag.
9706660	9708660	Now is the part of the show where we're going to get ranty.
9708660	9710660	It's the FUs of the week.
9710660	9711660	Rawr.
9711660	9733660	My FU goes towards my last week and finals week of school.
9733660	9737660	I have a lot of work to get done and not that much time to get it done in.
9737660	9743660	And my second FU goes towards my really weird bout of exhaustion slash insomnia
9743660	9749660	that's been making me completely wiped out and kind of burned on everything going on.
9749660	9751660	So, I'll figure it out.
9751660	9753660	It's probably just end of school stress.
9753660	9754660	Okay.
9754660	9755660	Loki?
9755660	9761660	FU to the upcoming hot that's going to be coming this week.
9761660	9766660	I mean, it's not hot as what we normally get.
9766660	9769660	But it's going to get up to 85 degrees this week.
9769660	9771660	And that's not that bad.
9771660	9775660	But this time of year though, you know, 85 feels like 105.
9775660	9778660	And then once we hit 105, we're begging for 85.
9778660	9781660	But right now, it feels like 105.
9781660	9783660	So, dammit.
9783660	9784660	I hate being hot.
9784660	9786660	I like being cold.
9786660	9787660	Cold is easy.
9787660	9788660	Put more layers on.
9788660	9790660	Hot, can't take more layers off.
9790660	9792660	It only takes so many layers.
9792660	9794660	My FU of the week, I don't know.
9794660	9795660	Things have been pretty good actually.
9795660	9800660	I'll just FU to me not usually getting enough sleep at night.
9800660	9802660	I should stop doing that.
9802660	9804660	Oh, FU to having to work on Saturday.
9804660	9808660	That's definitely worthy of an FU because that's why I had to get up early on Saturday.
9808660	9810660	Exactly.
9810660	9818660	I actually was not forced to come in, but I just did it because when people ask me nicely,
9818660	9821660	I tend to do nice things even though I might not really like them.
9821660	9822660	All right.
9822660	9823660	Moving on.
9823660	9826660	Let's get into a couple more news stories.
9826660	9828660	And then finally, the Skype line.
9828660	9830660	I expect it to be ringing off the hook tonight, but we'll see.
9830660	9831660	All right.
9831660	9833660	Let's get into some other news.
9833660	9834660	Loki.
9834660	9835660	Yes, this is kind of funny.
9835660	9839660	It's one of the most annoying characters ever.
9839660	9843660	Getting kind of a return in sort of a gaming form.
9843660	9850660	Microsoft Office's Clippy is getting its own tutorial slash game.
9850660	9854660	I guess Ribbon Hero 2 Clippy Second Chance.
9854660	9865660	It's a video game slash tutorial to kind of walk you through some of the new features of Microsoft Office.
9865660	9868660	It says, yes, we've turned Office into a game.
9868660	9873660	If you're going to spend time immersed in the inner workings of Office, by golly, it should be fun.
9873660	9879660	Discover new Office features by actually using them with hit button to fall back on in case you get stuck.
9879660	9882660	Race for a high score with colleagues, classmates, and friends.
9882660	9887660	You can put your high score on your resume to show off your Office skills.
9887660	9889660	I don't recommend doing that.
9889660	9893660	For those of you who have been paying attention, we've done this before.
9893660	9896660	That's how we've got the two at the end of the title.
9896660	9898660	So what's different?
9898660	9899660	Clippy.
9899660	9904660	Comic strips, colorful graphics, surprise animations, multiple levels, time travel, upside down.
9904660	9915660	Clippy, spaceships, Greek gods, bow and arrow battles, and tons of useful Office features.
9915660	9918660	Will it slow down your computer insanely too?
9918660	9921660	That's what Clippy was always best for.
9921660	9924660	Alright, moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.
9924660	9927660	It's about a big, big PC game that's set to come out soon.
9927660	9929660	Diablo 3.
9929660	9930660	When is it coming out?
9930660	9933660	Well, some are saying possibly 2011.
9933660	9936660	I kind of hate news stories like this because it kind of seems obvious.
9936660	9938660	Well, it's either coming out this year or next.
9938660	9939660	I mean, no shit.
9939660	9941660	But here's what's causing the speculation.
9941660	9942660	No, no, no, it should have been.
9942660	9944660	It's either coming out this year or later.
9944660	9945660	Yeah.
9945660	9946660	Here's what's causing the speculation.
9946660	9950660	The game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, said this to the New York Times.
9950660	9953660	Quote, we're definitely in the home stretch.
9953660	9954660	We're crunching.
9954660	9956660	This is when the magic happens.
9956660	9958660	But, I mean, for Blizzard?
9958660	9959660	Shit.
9959660	9960660	That could mean anything.
9960660	9961660	I hope it's this year.
9961660	9963660	I would love to be playing Diablo 3 by Christmas.
9963660	9966660	I'm hoping BlizzCon will shed some light on that.
9966660	9969660	Especially since they're not going to be releasing a WoW expansion this year.
9969660	9971660	They may have a Starcraft 2 expansion.
9971660	9974660	But otherwise, there's nothing for Blizzard to release this year.
9974660	9976660	So I sort of hope it is Diablo 3.
9976660	9978660	I would say it's got to release in the...
9978660	9980660	Well, they have a new MMO they're working on.
9980660	9982660	Yeah, but that's not coming out until, like, 2013.
9982660	9984660	Doesn't mean they can't announce it.
9984660	9986660	They can announce it, but it won't make them money.
9986660	9987660	An announcement doesn't make you money.
9987660	9990660	Well, that's not necessarily true there, no.
9990660	9994660	Because an announcement at BlizzCon makes them money.
9994660	9996660	Because people go to BlizzCon for those announcements.
9996660	9999660	They could get up on stage and announce that they just pooped.
9999660	10003660	And people would pay $175 to still go.
10003660	10006660	Because that's what BlizzCon's turned into.
10006660	10013660	It's people paying to watch what they should be able to see at E3 on TV for free.
10013660	10016660	And I love the Blizzard products.
10016660	10019660	I just haven't loved them as much since Activision bought them.
10019660	10022660	But anyway, if you want to know more about that, go listen to the other show.
10022660	10025660	Meanwhile, let's get into the calls.
10025660	10027660	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
10027660	10029660	or our username on Skype is OrangeLaundryAD.
10029660	10030660	The phones are open.
10030660	10034660	PSN, Xbox, whatever you want to talk about in the gaming world.
10034660	10035660	Give us a call.
10035660	10037660	We'll let you talk for a minute here.
10037660	10038660	Kaijuto in our chatroom says,
10038660	10040660	I think Diablo 3 is going to be a letdown.
10040660	10041660	I really hope not.
10041660	10044660	Like, there's a part of me that doesn't want to argue with you.
10044660	10046660	Because you might be right, but I just really hope not.
10046660	10047660	I hope you're wrong.
10047660	10049660	I think it won't be worth the development time.
10049660	10050660	I'll put it that way.
10050660	10052660	I mean, I don't know.
10052660	10054660	Blizzard doesn't really seem to put out bad games, though.
10054660	10056660	You know, Starcraft 2 is still really good.
10056660	10058660	WoW has all been great.
10058660	10060660	But then again, Cataclysm did have a lot of problems.
10060660	10063660	It's been the weakest WoW expansion so far.
10063660	10066660	It hasn't lived through its life expectancy yet.
10066660	10070660	But so far, it has not WoWed people,
10070660	10075660	ironic, across the spectrum that the other expansions have, I would say.
10075660	10077660	S.J. in chat says,
10077660	10082660	I have zero hopes that it's coming out till it's in my hands.
10082660	10083660	Well, you may be waiting for a little while.
10083660	10084660	We'll see.
10084660	10086660	Anyway, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
10086660	10087660	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
10087660	10088660	Who's this?
10088660	10090660	It's Deathwishing.
10090660	10092660	Hey, Deathwishing, how are you?
10092660	10095660	I'm pretty good.
10095660	10096660	I have to comment.
10096660	10097660	I'm full of patriotism.
10097660	10098660	Yeah, I know.
10098660	10100660	It's crazy what's going on in the world.
10100660	10101660	But I have to comment on this.
10101660	10102660	It's so much more important.
10102660	10104660	I'm looking at your little Skype picture,
10104660	10106660	which is very MySpace-y.
10106660	10107660	Like, what is this?
10107660	10109660	Are you taking a picture of yourself in the bathroom?
10109660	10111660	Well, it's my senior year, right?
10111660	10115660	And my barbershop quartet, we all went to Disneyland,
10115660	10117660	and my friend bought a fox hat, so I had to take a picture of it.
10117660	10118660	Oh, that's what you're wearing.
10118660	10119660	I think it's a chick magnet.
10119660	10120660	It's a chick magnet.
10120660	10121660	All right, awesome.
10121660	10123660	All right, well, what did you call in to talk about?
10123660	10126660	PSN stuff.
10126660	10127660	Okay.
10127660	10128660	What are your thoughts?
10128660	10135660	I guess PlayStation Network feels that they're obligated to give free stuff
10135660	10141660	on a free service to all the whiny 4chan babies.
10141660	10145660	So you don't think they should be giving anything at all?
10145660	10149660	I only think they should be giving reimbursements to the people that pay
10149660	10152660	for PlayStation Plus, you know, and the people that pay for services
10152660	10157660	like DC Online and paying customers.
10157660	10162660	Not like everyone gets free stuff because you all bitch,
10162660	10165660	but we're going to say we're polite.
10165660	10169660	It's, I don't know, it kind of ends in the fact that I can't play SOCOM before.
10169660	10170660	Now, be honest.
10170660	10174660	Now, see, usually that sort of reaction comes from what you would call
10174660	10176660	a Sony fanboy, so be honest.
10176660	10179660	Are you a Sony fanboy?
10179660	10185660	I own all systems, but I really, I mean, I kind of like it
10185660	10188660	because I can get PlayStation Plus for free now just to try it out,
10188660	10192660	but I guess I kind of am a Sony fanboy.
10192660	10194660	All right, see, see, all right.
10194660	10197660	Well, I mean, what did you think of all this, the hacking and all that?
10197660	10200660	I mean, as a Sony fanboy, are you like, this could happen to anyone,
10200660	10203660	or are you like, wow, maybe Sony kind of asked for this?
10203660	10206660	I first went, wow, holy shit, I can't believe this happened,
10206660	10209660	and then after I saw, oh, we didn't have a crypt and stuff,
10209660	10214660	I kind of just went, Sony, you set yourself up to this, you morons.
10214660	10218660	I mean, you would think a company with all this money, with services,
10218660	10221660	you know, in this age of day that has a service where, okay,
10221660	10225660	we have for the developers, we can buy all of each other's games
10225660	10228660	off our PlayStation Network, but we're going to keep it on the same server
10228660	10231660	because that's the smart thing to do.
10231660	10233660	Oh, no, guys, we're hacked now, and guess what?
10233660	10236660	Your credit card's out, and the whole thing with the way they work
10236660	10238660	the information, that just pissed me off, too.
10238660	10243660	It's like the United States, which I love.
10243660	10252660	Yeah, so do you agree with what we were saying earlier in the show
10252660	10256660	about Sony is just hard-headed?
10256660	10258660	Very, very much so.
10258660	10261660	Why is it?
10261660	10265660	Is Sony just drunk with power from being from the rampant success
10265660	10268660	of the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2?
10268660	10274660	Well, yeah, I think so that. I think that what they're trying to,
10274660	10279660	you know, they're too afraid of the $599 US dollar system being, like, compromised.
10279660	10281660	You know?
10281660	10282660	Right.
10282660	10286660	What I'm talking about here, how it's like, oh, we have such an expensive system.
10286660	10289660	Oh, shit, we fucked up.
10289660	10292660	I think that whole not encrypting the data is going to be a real thing
10292660	10294660	that comes back to bite him in the ass.
10294660	10297660	I think if this thing does go to trial, that's going to be the piece of it.
10297660	10300660	You saw the stock prices go down, right?
10300660	10303660	Oh, well, of course. Of course their stock price is going to go down.
10303660	10305660	Yeah, it already bit them.
10305660	10306660	Oh, yeah.
10306660	10309660	Especially how much of big releases for them came out that week, too.
10309660	10313660	Hence me buying, actually, one of those releases and not being able to play it.
10313660	10314660	Yeah.
10314660	10316660	Well, not being able to play it online, but still.
10316660	10318660	What is going on with SOCOM right now?
10318660	10322660	Does SOCOM even have a single player? It does, right?
10322660	10326660	If you can call it that.
10326660	10330660	Interesting question. I like this comment from bonds006 in the chat room.
10330660	10334660	If any one of us was working in the higher ranks of Sony,
10334660	10338660	would we do something different?
10338660	10342660	I told, I mean, I was trying to get, if I was in the higher ranks,
10342660	10346660	I would have ran up to the frickin' night key people in there
10346660	10349660	and punched them all in the dick.
10349660	10351660	Let me put it this way.
10351660	10356660	Yes, if I were Kazurai, I would have promptly fired the person in IT
10356660	10358660	and I would have announced to the world that that's what we did
10358660	10360660	and that's what we're going to change.
10360660	10362660	But, I don't know.
10362660	10365660	That's, yeah, that's I think what I would have done, too.
10365660	10368660	I don't know if I would have punched them in the dick, but maybe with words.
10368660	10371660	Hey, hey, they had it coming.
10371660	10372660	Yeah, I know.
10372660	10378660	But Xbox fanboys, user service did go down for three weeks in 2007, too.
10378660	10379660	Three weeks?
10379660	10381660	I don't remember Xbox being down for three weeks.
10381660	10383660	Three days, maybe.
10383660	10386660	I had to do over like December like a shitload of people rushed online
10386660	10388660	because they got their Xboxes.
10388660	10391660	That was like three days. It was not three weeks.
10391660	10392660	I think it was three weeks.
10392660	10393660	No, I think you're wrong.
10393660	10396660	It was like three days, three weeks of like getting the network back up fully running.
10396660	10400660	If you want to get the Xbox fanboys, you need to go to the Red Ring of Death.
10400660	10402660	But again, because that was terrible.
10402660	10406660	However, Microsoft handled it much better than Sony's handling it so far.
10406660	10409660	So, all right.
10409660	10410660	True.
10410660	10411660	Anyhow.
10411660	10413660	It's all good in the tent. At least everything may have Prince money.
10413660	10416660	All right, I got to let you guys, we can get more calls, and you're breaking up a little bit anyway.
10416660	10418660	So, take care, buddy.
10418660	10419660	Bye.
10419660	10422660	All right, that was Death Wishing, ladies and gentlemen,
10422660	10425660	who apparently sings in a barbershop quartet that once performed at Disneyland.
10425660	10427660	I never knew.
10427660	10428660	The things we learn about the listeners.
10428660	10433660	Maybe we need our listeners to tell us more secrets about themselves.
10433660	10435660	That's what I'd like to hear from the listeners that call in tonight.
10435660	10437660	We want to know something about you.
10437660	10438660	Tell us the secret.
10438660	10442660	Nobody would know this by looking at me.
10442660	10444660	All right, let's go to the phones and get another call.
10444660	10445660	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10445660	10448660	Who's this?
10448660	10450660	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
10450660	10451660	¿Quien es?
10451660	10452660	Hello?
10452660	10454660	Hi, who's this?
10454660	10455660	Hey, can you hear me?
10455660	10456660	Yes.
10456660	10457660	Hi, who is this?
10457660	10459660	I've got a bad echo.
10459660	10460660	Uh-oh, that's a problem.
10460660	10461660	Hold on a second.
10461660	10462660	I'm sorry.
10462660	10464660	I didn't expect you guys to pick up that quick.
10464660	10467660	Sure, we'll hold.
10467660	10469660	Can you hear us at all?
10469660	10470660	Yeah, there we go.
10470660	10471660	I had to kill my stream.
10471660	10472660	That's all right.
10472660	10473660	It happens.
10473660	10474660	Yeah, yeah.
10474660	10475660	First rule of calling into radio.
10475660	10476660	Turn off your radio.
10476660	10477660	All right.
10477660	10478660	Who is this?
10478660	10479660	Hey, this is Blue Swim.
10479660	10480660	Hi, Blue Swim.
10480660	10484660	All right, tell us something we wouldn't know by looking at you.
10484660	10491660	Well, I'm a Spice Girls fan.
10491660	10492660	Awesome.
10492660	10493660	Awesome.
10493660	10494660	All right, great secret.
10494660	10495660	All right.
10495660	10498660	All right, what's on your mind tonight?
10498660	10501660	Forgive me if you already touched on this.
10501660	10503660	I was in and out of the room.
10503660	10504660	Yeah, I know.
10504660	10506660	There's a lot of news going on in the world.
10506660	10508660	It's fine.
10508660	10516660	Did you weigh in on the show about IGN's little fake or gay article?
10516660	10521660	No, there was a part of me that didn't want to go there, but if the listeners want to
10521660	10522660	go there, then fine.
10522660	10525660	Why don't you do some reporting on this?
10525660	10528660	Tell us a little bit about what happened and how you feel about it.
10528660	10540660	Well, basically, IGN took the time to write a little article detailing the sexuality of
10540660	10544660	Yoshi and Turok, of all people.
10544660	10554660	Basically, they went through this whole long detailed article explaining that Yoshi is,
10554660	10560660	I believe they used the phrase technically queer or something to that effect, because
10560660	10570660	he is dating Birdo, who apparently is a transsexual, if I got the article right.
10570660	10576660	My browser's kind of going slow there for a minute.
10576660	10578660	Yeah, so yeah.
10578660	10583660	I was told on Twitter that the article was actually written by somebody who was gay,
10583660	10585660	which makes it stranger.
10585660	10586660	I don't know.
10586660	10587660	It makes the whole thing weirder.
10587660	10592660	But as I mentioned on Twitter, articles are written to generate hits, and that's one reason
10592660	10596660	why I wouldn't link it for my Twitter, because I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.
10596660	10602660	And I think these sorts of rampant speculation, it just adds fuel to all that stuff, and it's
10602660	10603660	just unnecessary.
10603660	10610660	If you want to write an interesting article about sexuality, why not talk about the impact
10610660	10611660	of that?
10611660	10615660	Or why are more games not putting it in their storylines?
10615660	10619660	Or what is it that gay folks want in gaming?
10619660	10621660	Maybe interview them.
10621660	10623660	It's probably the same thing as everyone else, to be honest.
10623660	10624660	I'll tell you that.
10624660	10626660	I don't know, just an article like that just seemed so unnecessary.
10626660	10631660	Or give us an article with a developer for Dragon Age, or one of the studios that actually
10631660	10635660	put a gay character in the game, about how they did it, and how they made sure to address
10635660	10640660	the sensitivity by making it realistic without being a joke.
10640660	10642660	I don't know.
10642660	10647660	Other than like, oh, Birdo's gay because of a misprint that was in an instruction manual
10647660	10649660	so many years ago, because they used to rush the translation.
10649660	10650660	I mean, it's stupid.
10650660	10654660	But it actually has been official that Birdo is transgender.
10654660	10655660	But still.
10655660	10659660	Wasn't that confirmed in Captain Rainbow or something like that?
10659660	10664660	That Nintendo Wii game that only came out in Japan several years ago?
10664660	10668660	Also, there's plenty of folks that would argue that just because you date somebody who's
10668660	10670660	transsexual doesn't make you one sexuality or another.
10670660	10673660	I think some people just care too much about who's gay and who's straight.
10673660	10677660	I think just love whoever you want to love and be over it, you know?
10677660	10679660	That's just me.
10679660	10684660	I'm all for equal rights.
10684660	10686660	Well, what did you think when you read the article?
10686660	10689660	Did it piss you off, or were you like, too many people were getting their panties ruffled
10689660	10692660	over this?
10692660	10700660	When I first saw on IGN's Twitter, when I first saw the title of this, I didn't even
10700660	10706660	have to click on it before I'm thinking, what are they fucking doing?
10706660	10712660	It just seemed like a desperate grab for hits.
10712660	10716660	It was unnecessary.
10716660	10719660	It just seemed like pure bullshit to me.
10719660	10725660	It's not an article that they needed to write.
10725660	10729660	It's not an editorial they needed to write.
10729660	10733660	I'm looking at our chatroom here, and Makeup Boy X is in our chatroom saying,
10733660	10736660	yeah, the guy on IGN came out as gay recently.
10736660	10738660	He was just trying to write a fun article about it.
10738660	10743660	I'm just kind of like, well, why not write an article about coming out as gay then in
10743660	10746660	gaming culture?
10746660	10748660	Is Yoshi gay?
10748660	10749660	Is this so weird?
10749660	10750660	I don't know.
10750660	10751660	It's unnecessary.
10751660	10752660	It's unnecessary.
10752660	10755660	That's, I think, the best thing I can think of to describe it.
10755660	10757660	It was just unnecessary.
10757660	10764660	Yeah, I know they were kind of joking about whether Yoshi was a man or a woman in Super
10764660	10773660	Smash Brothers during Snake and Otacon's conversation before a fight with Yoshi.
10773660	10782660	I remember them just bickering back and forth about, but he lays eggs, but it's a boy.
10782660	10783660	Oh my gosh.
10783660	10785660	All right, well, we've got to let you go to get some more calls.
10785660	10788660	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10788660	10792660	I just want to tell Defective Candy thank you for, I tell you what I want, what I really,
10792660	10794660	really want over Twitter.
10794660	10795660	All right.
10795660	10801660	Well, I have one final thought for you along those lines.
10801660	10804660	There you go.
10804660	10806660	That's not Viva Forever.
10806660	10808660	It's not Viva Forever.
10808660	10809660	It's the song I happen to have up.
10809660	10810660	All right.
10810660	10811660	Have a go on Blue Swim.
10811660	10812660	Take care, buddy.
10812660	10813660	Thank you very much.
10813660	10814660	You too.
10814660	10815660	All right.
10815660	10816660	1877 Game OLR.
10816660	10818660	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10818660	10821660	Let me ask if there's any last minute stories.
10821660	10822660	I guess I should check in with Loki.
10822660	10824660	I hate to pull you from the portal.
10824660	10825660	No, that's all right.
10825660	10826660	All right.
10826660	10827660	No, we do have some last minute stories.
10827660	10832660	Of course, there's, I don't know why you would buy in the collection now, maybe because Final
10832660	10834660	Fantasy XIV is still broken.
10834660	10837660	But Final Fantasy XI, if you happen to want to join that right now, there's actually a
10837660	10839660	good collection they have out there.
10839660	10845660	They updated their ultimate collection now with the Ibiza edition, and it includes basically
10845660	10854660	the game plus all the expansions plus the extra Ibiza, I guess, expansions.
10854660	10858660	There are three add-on scenarios, all for 20 bucks.
10858660	10861660	Okay, Loki, I want you to point at me and get ready to laugh.
10861660	10862660	Yeah.
10862660	10868660	Because I kind of want to go back and play, just for a couple weeks, just to relive old
10868660	10870660	times, like revisiting an old friend.
10870660	10876660	And then on top of that, you do get a special beret that I guess will increase skill gain,
10876660	10881660	extra movement speed, and both magic and health regeneration.
10881660	10886660	And that's, I guess the new edition will be available to download May 16th.
10886660	10888660	That's kind of cool.
10888660	10897660	I want to, it's just a small part of me that kind of wants to go, just go hug an old friend.
10897660	10904660	And then there's rumor that Ocarina of Time 3D is going to be a limited initial release.
10904660	10905660	Why?
10905660	10913660	I mean, other than them being disappointed about the 3DS launch numbers, why would you
10913660	10915660	do that?
10915660	10920660	Make it extremely small so that people are trying to find it?
10920660	10922660	See, Nintendo toys with their customers like that.
10922660	10924660	That's the type of company they are.
10924660	10925660	Awesome.
10925660	10929660	Well, I'll tell you what, I'll free up one extra copy for those people looking for it,
10929660	10934660	because I'm not buying it.
10934660	10939660	And last but not least, if you don't like Madden, yet you still want a football game,
10939660	10944660	All Pro Football 2K8, they have released, there's an editor that's been released for
10944660	10949660	it, for the Xbox 360 version, using some file editing.
10949660	10953660	And this can be done on non-modded consoles, by the way.
10953660	10961660	You can actually update your rosters, you can also create custom teams, I guess adjusting
10961660	10970660	stats and players and all that stuff, ratings, abilities, physical appearance, and basically
10970660	10977660	create your own teams if you want, or base them off of the actual NFL teams.
10977660	10983660	And I'm sure All Pro Football 2K8 is probably dirt cheap nowadays.
10983660	10988660	So if you're interested in that, check out operationsports.com, they had a feature running
10988660	10995660	on it, it's Flying Finn releases All Pro Football 2K8 editor.
10995660	10996660	That's it.
10996660	10997660	That's it.
10997660	11001660	Alright, again, I'll give the number one more time, 1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype
11001660	11006660	is Orange Lounge Radio, I know probably not a lot of people want to call in at this point,
11006660	11009660	I thought it was going to be a busy phone line tonight, but probably just too many people
11009660	11013660	distracted with other things going on in the world, and I guess I can understand that.
11013660	11020660	But one more time, 1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11020660	11025660	So, what do we talk about for a few more minutes while we wait for the phones to ring?
11025660	11028660	This is such a funny image.
11028660	11029660	Oh, one of the...
11029660	11033660	Yeah, someone finally did like a little image of Obama, it says, sorry it took so long to
11033660	11037660	get you a copy of my birth certificate, I was too busy killing Osama Bin Laden.
11037660	11038660	That's funny.
11038660	11041660	I don't know, I don't know.
11041660	11045660	I don't want to, I have things I want to say, but I don't want to get too political on the
11045660	11052660	show, but I'm just, I just hope that this will be the first step in this all being over.
11052660	11055660	So, that's all I'll say on that.
11055660	11060660	Alright, well, I guess that's it, we're done.
11060660	11062660	We're going to go ahead and close up the lines.
11062660	11066660	It is, it's got, it's 1230 on the east coast anyway, so we're done.
11066660	11069660	Let's go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
11069660	11074660	But first, let me also say this, if you liked Orange Lounge Radio, if you like the show
11074660	11077660	here, do help spread the word about the show.
11077660	11080660	Tell a friend or, you know, a nice five star review on iTunes is great too.
11080660	11083660	There's been some really nice ones written in the past couple days, really appreciate
11083660	11084660	it you guys.
11084660	11087660	I do read them and they make me smile, so thank you guys very much for those that leave
11087660	11088660	those.
11088660	11089660	Really appreciate it.
11089660	11091660	So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
11091660	11093660	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
11093660	11095660	We.
11095660	11097660	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11097660	11099660	Portal 2 is pretty awesome.
11099660	11102660	Chapter 2, getting into it.
11102660	11106660	My final thought is ice cream.
11106660	11107660	What?
11107660	11108660	I know.
11108660	11110660	There's Baskin Robbins around the corner.
11110660	11113660	I know, but they'll be closed by the time we're done with Afterbirth and all that.
11113660	11114660	Alright, that's it guys.
11114660	11116660	Thank you so much for listening to the show.
11116660	11120660	Let's hope that PSN comes back in the next week and maybe we'll forget about it by next
11120660	11121660	week.
11121660	11122660	Likely not.
11122660	11125660	But all the latest in gaming news and all that good stuff and your voices.
11125660	11127660	Once again, same bat time, same bat channel.
