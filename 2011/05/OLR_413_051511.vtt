00:00.000 --> 00:19.840
Tonight, May 15th, 2011, PlayStation Network returns after a three-week hiatus, a new entry

00:19.840 --> 00:24.980
in a popular fighting franchise is announced, and a classic Sega Genesis video game is localized

00:24.980 --> 00:31.840
for a new release.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Lounge Radio.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.800
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.620
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.

00:42.620 --> 00:45.520
First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.520
Hi.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.520
How are you?

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
I am accomplished.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.520
You're accomplished.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.520
Why is that?

00:50.520 --> 00:52.680
Because I beat Portal 2 just now.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
Congratulations.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.720
I walked in like right as the ending was going on.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.120
I'm not going to spoil what happens, but I was like, oh, it's this part.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.120
I like this part.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.440
So I like the all of that part.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.800
I figured you would.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.800
All right.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.640
Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.640
Hello.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.040
Now what is this you're eating tonight?

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
That looks burnt.

01:11.040 --> 01:17.280
Yeah, they don't, they don't understand what well done means versus, you know, torch.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.880
Your pizza looks burnt or dead.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.880
It's certainly well done.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
What is this?

01:20.880 --> 01:21.880
Is this quadruple bacon pizza again?

01:21.880 --> 01:22.880
No, it's still triple bacon.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
Oh, my bad.

01:23.880 --> 01:29.160
How, how, how dare I increase the bacon anyhow?

01:29.160 --> 01:30.160
We're going to get into the show.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.320
Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

01:34.320 --> 01:39.160
right after the Bobby black Wolf show at all games radio, www dot all games.com.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.760
It's very easy to hear the show.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.800
All you do is you go to all games.com and as long as you have what flash installed,

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
it comes right up.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
So it's very easy.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.760
You don't, you don't have to worry about any of those complicated, getting it into your

01:49.760 --> 01:51.640
win amp or iTunes or whatever.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
Very easy.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.000
I said it were easy, but if you, but if you want to put it in, when you have an iTunes,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
you can do that too.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.760
There's more information at all games.com.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.520
Um, also our chat room chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.080
It's very important to know we don't use the normal all games chat room.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.080
Why?

02:07.080 --> 02:08.080
I don't know.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.080
It's just the way we've done it.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
And we've had our own chat room for like nine years.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.840
Plus we like being in charge of our own chat room.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.320
So it's a power thing.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.220
Anyhow so chat dot orange lounge, radio.com is where you can join us to chat with us live

02:18.220 --> 02:21.640
and give us your comments on what's going on, uh, such as break man in our chat room

02:21.640 --> 02:25.000
tonight who says there is no such thing as too much bacon.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't know.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.120
I think we remember when we had the bacon party for one of your birthdays and there

02:30.120 --> 02:32.160
was like all these bacon dishes here in house.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.440
That was, that was too much bacon.

02:33.440 --> 02:37.740
I have to say actually the smell is turning my stomach.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.640
I was going to have a heart attack.

02:39.640 --> 02:44.720
So anyhow, well you need, you'll have to get some Febreze or something to smell.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.720
I don't know.

02:45.720 --> 02:50.360
I've got Moroccan spice Febreze to cover Shermy's ass.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.520
Yes, it smells good.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.080
All right.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.920
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into how was your gaming week.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.260
Every week we talk about some of the games we've been playing this week, which I guess

03:00.260 --> 03:04.160
every single podcast pretty much does that this day and age, but I swear we were doing

03:04.160 --> 03:05.680
it this way for a long time.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.960
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
How was your gaming week?

03:07.960 --> 03:13.920
Well, I just beat portal two and I played some well and because certain people in our

03:13.920 --> 03:19.200
guild are going to be helping me run through a dungeon and learn how to tank on Rebecca

03:19.200 --> 03:23.240
black, I still love the character and I still have people's reactions.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.440
I have made another character.

03:25.440 --> 03:31.880
I remade my, my shaman and named her after my old, uh, one of my old tabletop characters.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.480
His name is Bloodwin, very Welsh.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.560
And uh, she's level 10, 11, 11.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
She's 11.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.560
Wow.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.520
You're starting to sound like me.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
I played.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
Wow.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
Wow.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
And more.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.520
Wow.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
I'm getting pissed off though.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.240
I'm getting pissed off at the core and nobody can give me the 300 gold.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.320
I need to get, uh, you'll have to earn it.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.040
Do a herbalism and mining.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.040
That's how I did it.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.760
You just go collect things for a while and then sell.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.760
That's how you do it.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.000
Then I just need to get rid of tailoring anyhow.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.400
I don't want to fill up too much of a wow chat cause there's a whole nother show for

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
that now.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
So anything else you've been playing this week?

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
No.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.680
Seen any good movies lately?

04:13.680 --> 04:16.960
I see a Tron thing behind you and that made me think like, Oh, Tron's on blue.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.440
I'm supposed to go see, um, Thor on Tuesday with Becky.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.440
Stay till after the credits.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
I know.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.440
That's what everybody says.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.440
I know.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.440
All right.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.320
There's only one character in that whole movie I care about seeing and he's only in one part

04:28.320 --> 04:32.240
cause it's my dude.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.360
All right.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
But no spoilers.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
All right.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.360
Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
What have you been playing?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.560
Um, just really two things.

04:39.560 --> 04:45.560
Um, you know, portal two and um, grant the data and portal two.

04:45.560 --> 04:51.200
I've chapter eight and um, grand theft auto.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.200
Well it's just grand theft auto.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.960
We decided to start playing some grenade launcher only games, which is kind of fun.

04:55.960 --> 05:01.360
Um, man, that's pretty much, that's about it.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
Wow.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.020
You guys both haven't been playing anything new.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.020
That's all right.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.280
Uh, let's see me.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.880
Uh, actually a lot of it's the same.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.360
I have not played a lot of new stuff.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.360
A lot of the same stuff.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.560
I've also been playing portal two, uh, a little bit of mortal combat.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.760
Um, as is, you know, I know we're getting into this in the news in a little bit, but

05:17.760 --> 05:19.680
it's pretty completely fucking obvious.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.560
PlayStation network came back up yesterday, so I was finally able to get in there and

05:23.560 --> 05:28.680
uh, play some mortal combat online and I got my ass handed to me cause I'm just, I guess

05:28.680 --> 05:30.000
I'm just not good at fighters.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I don't know.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I need more practice.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.080
Uh, but I was trying first match was a little laggy.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.060
I was a little bit disappointed at how kind of laggy and it was one of those things where

05:38.060 --> 05:40.280
the frames per second suffer.

05:40.280 --> 05:44.580
Like that's how mortal combat kind of compensates for the lag is that your, your frames suffer.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.680
But then I played another match today and it was fine.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.940
It was very smooth and, and worked fine.

05:48.940 --> 05:53.400
So I guess it really is just about who you're connecting to or the service is a little bit

05:53.400 --> 05:54.560
wonky still.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.600
Like I tried to log in today and I got the PlayStation is down for maintenance message.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.880
So I did it like four times and it finally let me in.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.400
So kind of weird how that's working, but whatever.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.060
Um, otherwise, as far as new games go, there is one new game I've been playing this week

06:08.060 --> 06:11.320
and uh, that is a downloadable game on Xbox live.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.200
I believe it's on PlayStation network as well, but you know, haven't really been able to

06:15.200 --> 06:16.600
tell for the past three weeks.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.400
So, uh, it's on Xbox live arcade.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.600
It's called might and magic clash of heroes, I think is what it's called.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
It's a school.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.720
Well, yeah, it's, it's interesting because it's, it's a DS game.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.920
It was a DS game a few years ago, but I have kind of lost touch of the Nintendo DS scene

06:31.920 --> 06:32.920
about four years ago.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.640
There just hasn't really been a lot on the DS.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.280
I really wanted to play that wasn't like a first party game.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.520
Uh, but apparently this one was pretty good and I totally missed it.

06:40.520 --> 06:45.200
Uh, so it's out now on Xbox live and apparently PlayStation network, not that you'll be able

06:45.200 --> 06:46.840
to download that anytime soon.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.680
Um, but it's a port of the DS version.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.320
And from what I understand, they've done some redone graphics and things like that.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.160
But let me tell you a little bit about the game.

06:54.160 --> 07:01.920
It's very much a puzzle quest, gyro mancer, RPPG game, role playing puzzle game.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.080
It's another one of these, um, the battle system.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.400
If you watch somebody else play it, you're not going to understand what the hell is going

07:08.400 --> 07:12.200
on, but it has a really good ramp up in the single player mode to kind of get you used

07:12.200 --> 07:13.200
to things.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.740
And the best way I could explain it, it's kind of like magical drop where you pull things

07:17.740 --> 07:20.920
down from one column and put them in another column.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.520
Only it's not like it doesn't move down slowly like magical drop does.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.120
You only have a certain number of moves per turn and you do offensive attacks by vertical

07:30.120 --> 07:33.580
lines and defensive attacks by horizontal lines.

07:33.580 --> 07:34.580
So it's kind of neat.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.960
And there's special pieces thrown in the mix.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.080
And most importantly, you're playing head to head.

07:40.080 --> 07:44.240
So there's like a line in the middle of the screen and you're working up towards that

07:44.240 --> 07:47.080
middle line and your opponent is working, it's flipped.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.960
They're working down in reverse.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.040
So kind of neat how that makes the battle draw out.

07:52.040 --> 07:58.240
So it's obviously because of that, it's a very slow paced RPG because each battle takes

07:58.240 --> 07:59.320
some time.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.840
But again, if you're into the puzzle quest two type of games where every battle is a

08:02.840 --> 08:06.880
full Bejeweled match basically, this game is really right up that alley.

08:06.880 --> 08:13.400
And I would say I actually found the game itself, the puzzle interface, to be kind of

08:13.400 --> 08:15.120
a neat little thinker.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.880
You know, and it's something a lot different from the Bejeweled-esque games, which pretty

08:18.880 --> 08:24.440
much a lot of the other games that are out there in the RPPG series kind of fall into

08:24.440 --> 08:25.840
right now.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.400
Maybe the lone exception is that unremarkable one that Konami put out.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.000
Puzzle Chronicles, I played that one for a little bit, didn't really find that that remarkable.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.020
Sorry to Puzzle Chronicle fans.

08:36.020 --> 08:39.240
But I did enjoy Puzzle Quest 2 and I enjoyed this Clash of Heroes.

08:39.240 --> 08:43.120
So if you are into the puzzle games, you at least have to download the demo and check

08:43.120 --> 08:44.120
it out.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.900
That's the nice thing about Xbox Live Arcade and PSN whenever it's up, is that there are

08:47.900 --> 08:48.900
demos.

08:48.900 --> 08:52.900
So you know, there's not any harm in that other than I guess the bandwidth and time

08:52.900 --> 08:54.280
to download the demo.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.640
But yeah, if you're into the puzzle games, I really encourage you to check this one out

08:57.640 --> 09:00.760
because I think it would be worthy to your collection.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.960
Not just a single player mode, you can do Xbox Live matches.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.040
I have not delved so far into that section yet, so I can't say a lot, but I can imagine

09:07.040 --> 09:11.000
that is definitely something that the DS version probably didn't have.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.180
Maybe it had it locally.

09:12.180 --> 09:15.960
I don't know, I could be totally misstating, maybe someone in the chat will correct me.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.440
I don't know if it had internet play.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.640
Like I know DS has internet play, but obviously Xbox Live I think is a much bigger internet

09:22.640 --> 09:26.320
audience than probably the DS was, so there you go.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.440
Night Magic, Clash of Heroes, if you're into puzzle, RPPGs, check it out.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.480
Otherwise that was pretty much my gaming week.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.200
So let's get into housekeeping tonight, not a whole lot.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.560
Still some shows coming up over the next few weeks.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.680
We don't plan to have any weeks off anytime soon.

09:40.680 --> 09:45.940
E3 week might be a challenge, which is weird because none of us are actually going to E3,

09:45.940 --> 09:50.440
but Dark Soccer and I are going to LA.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.720
Long story.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.320
So we may or may not be back that Sunday.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.280
I think we're going to try and make it back in time for the show, which would be good.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.280
No promises though.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
No promises though.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.280
Exactly.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.280
So we'll let you know a little closer.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
So you have to stop by the cheese factory on the way back.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.960
That's still what, about three weeks away?

10:02.960 --> 10:05.960
So we got a little time to figure that all out.

10:05.960 --> 10:10.320
Meanwhile join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash

10:10.320 --> 10:16.840
OLR, and of course our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.560
Alright let's move on.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.520
I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

10:22.520 --> 10:28.320
CD Thunder in our chatroom says RPPG means Rob playing a video game rated PG.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.600
Rob playing PG.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.680
I guess my magic clash of heroes would be PG.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.760
I mean there's cartoony sword fights, but no blood or anything like that.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.520
Me playing Mortal Kombat would definitely not be rated PG because I giggle all the time

10:40.520 --> 10:42.220
at the fatalities.

10:42.220 --> 10:44.600
And I got to see the, what is it called?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.800
Is that called the Deadpool?

10:46.800 --> 10:49.640
Like I know that's also one of Dark Soccer's favorite comic book characters, but I think

10:49.640 --> 10:50.640
it's what it's called.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.640
The acid room.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.320
I saw the stage fatality for that for the first time.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.320
It was gross.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.320
But I giggled.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.320
It was funny.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.400
I need to get my mom back over and show her that one.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.600
You're supposed to bring the game over.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
Oh my bad.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
I forgot.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
Well I mean at some point.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
Come bring it over and play.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.080
I need to take my phone for fantasy 13 back.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.280
I'll go find it.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.280
You better.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.840
It's in the vault.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.840
It's in there somewhere.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.200
You know it's well taken care of.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.600
Brakeman in our chatroom says Sky and Dark Sakura are going to Hollywood.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.120
I bet they are going to be in a movie.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.120
What are you hiding from us?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.120
Hmm.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.120
Maybe.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
Maybe not.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.120
Rama says.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.120
A YouTube movie maybe.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.600
Rama says Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and an all new team up special, Fear and Loathing

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
in Los Angeles.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.000
Well we don't want to leave Loki out of all the fun stuff, but you know he has the baby.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
We can't stop here.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.520
This is Activision country.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.520
Alright anyhow, let's move on.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.520
Gaming news.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.520
Start us off.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
Loki.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.480
So there was like a firmware update today for the PlayStation Network.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
Yay.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
3.61.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.000
It's basically the update that makes you change your PlayStation Network ID.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.440
It was yesterday, but nobody knew.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.600
Today, yesterday, who cares.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.600
It all blends together.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.040
You know, I don't really give a shit.

11:59.040 --> 12:07.920
B, U, C. And I will say, okay, according to this post, this post was made on the 14th.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.880
That would be, oh that would be yesterday.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.800
Well I don't know my days, okay, so what can I say?

12:12.800 --> 12:13.960
They all just blend together.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.560
They all blend together, seriously.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.560
What day is today?

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
No, I don't know.

12:17.560 --> 12:24.960
Anyways, so yeah, firmware update, um, and of course that of course led to the PlayStation

12:24.960 --> 12:32.960
Network starting to come up, and I love this little very official Kazurai video where he's

12:32.960 --> 12:35.760
like making a State of the Union address or something like that.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.960
It was the blandest fucking message I've ever seen.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.040
Like how bad, I'm like, I hate kicking these guys when they're down, but I was watching

12:43.040 --> 12:44.560
it, I was falling asleep.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.240
Like this is why people are drawn to Reggie Fils-Aime from Nintendo, because you feel

12:48.240 --> 12:54.200
his enthusiasm, even when he's hawking such bullshit, like the vitality sensor or whatever,

12:54.200 --> 12:55.800
you at least really feel his enthusiasm.

12:55.800 --> 13:01.000
I think that's why he's very popular with gamers, but Kazurai is very, just like, so

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
vanilla.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.640
Hello, my name is Kazurai, and I like to party.

13:08.640 --> 13:16.920
We here at Sony embrace fun, hurrah, and I know my friends over here are now enjoying

13:16.920 --> 13:20.320
the fun PlayStation Network.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.480
Everybody happy.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.480
Party time.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.600
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.720
Yesterday was Thursday, tomorrow is Saturday.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.000
Hold on, I actually want to play a little bit of this.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.040
Did you watch this Dark Sakura?

13:35.040 --> 13:37.760
Tell me if this does not scream, I am a party animal.

13:37.760 --> 13:42.800
All the patients that you've shown as we work through this restoration process.

13:42.800 --> 13:47.160
Since the attacks on our networks, we've been working around the clock to bring game and

13:47.160 --> 13:50.060
media services back online.

13:50.060 --> 13:54.320
The service is being restored in phases, and I'm pleased to say that the first phase has

13:54.320 --> 13:56.840
now been launched in most regions of the world.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.080
And then I just spent a bunch of- What is he doing with his hands?

14:00.080 --> 14:04.720
He makes these very, very distinct, like, this is the part where I'm going to clasp

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
my hands.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.840
The teleprompter tells him to.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.240
You think?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.600
Fast Pines.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.120
Now for the secret ingredient.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.520
And with the money that we have lost, we're going to actually be raising a few of our

14:17.520 --> 14:21.040
rates in the next few months to pay for this new teleprompter.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.560
We had to keep it on a separate network because PSN is actually still down, and we're just

14:25.560 --> 14:30.040
put psychedelics into your breakfast cereal so that you'll believe it's back up.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.600
No seriously, we had to work around the clock, because some dumbass put a giant clock in

14:33.600 --> 14:36.920
our server room, and we had to work around that damn thing because we couldn't move it

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
out of the way.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.680
By we had to work around the clock, I mean everybody except me, where I went home and

14:41.680 --> 14:43.800
ate crayons.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.840
I especially like the green one, because when I cough it up later on, it looks like mucus

14:47.840 --> 14:51.280
and I can gross out my kids.

14:51.280 --> 15:00.000
I don't know, it just reminded me of, like, one of those, like, it's really cheesy acting

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
or something.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't know.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I- Whatever.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.560
He's reading off the teleprompter, because if you look where his eyes are fixated the

15:07.560 --> 15:10.760
entire time, he's reading a teleprompter.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.600
Or he's staring into your soul.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.800
He can't, he has no soul.

15:15.800 --> 15:19.160
Only people with souls can stare at other people with souls.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.000
It's in the unwritten book of souls.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.280
So anyways, yeah, PlayStation Network, the first phase, I guess leading up to the full

15:28.280 --> 15:33.480
return by the end of May, included the following services, obviously the ability to sign into

15:33.480 --> 15:38.920
the PlayStation Network and Curiosity, including resetting the passwords, restoration of online

15:38.920 --> 15:48.520
gameplay, including PlayStation 3 and PSP, playback of rental video content, music unlimited

15:48.520 --> 15:55.560
services from Curiosity, access to third party services such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and

15:55.560 --> 15:57.120
MLB TV.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.640
The friends category and PlayStation Home.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.220
Yes, thank God PlayStation Home was part of that.

16:02.220 --> 16:08.560
I missed it so much, because there's so much partying going on in PlayStation Home.

16:08.560 --> 16:18.820
And then of course, it's fully back up throughout North America, which is awesome for us.

16:18.820 --> 16:23.200
And I'm just running home right now to go sign up on the PlayStation Network to change

16:23.200 --> 16:29.240
my password and play some games, oh wait it's not, because I don't care.

16:29.240 --> 16:33.040
And then finally, Sony Online Entertainment announced that they're going to be offering

16:33.040 --> 16:38.240
their members a free month, which is great since it's been down for a month, and they're

16:38.240 --> 16:44.800
rewarding their players for the affected downtime, I guess some double XP events for EverQuest

16:44.800 --> 16:52.840
and Vanguard, and they're going to be doing some special gear in DC Universe and Star

16:52.840 --> 16:53.840
Wars Galaxies.

16:53.840 --> 16:58.640
I did see, well the DC Universe one, it's like some stupid cowl thing that looks like

16:58.640 --> 17:00.560
you could be Batman or something.

17:00.560 --> 17:06.880
And then Star Wars Galaxies, I'm surprised, I didn't even realize that was still up.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.280
But hey, learned something.

17:09.280 --> 17:14.480
And then finally, I guess lifetime subscribers will get another load in, or I guess some

17:14.480 --> 17:22.240
more in-game currency, 500 station cash.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.480
Whatever station cash is.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.440
I'm sorry, what?

17:27.440 --> 17:29.000
I'm sorry, you're right.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.440
My brain shut off for that whole thing right there.

17:32.440 --> 17:37.440
So here's what I have to say, now that everybody's relieved to be back online and playing, is

17:37.440 --> 17:38.840
anyone still mad?

17:38.840 --> 17:42.520
Because I have a feeling by next week no one's going to be mad anymore, they're just forgetting

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
about it.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.120
Well- Love Steam, I don't care.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.480
I don't know.

17:48.480 --> 17:54.520
With E3 so close and around the corner too, I mean, this is still going to be fresh in

17:54.520 --> 17:58.700
people's minds when E3 rolls around, and that's one of the disadvantages that Sony's going

17:58.700 --> 17:59.700
into this with.

17:59.700 --> 18:04.760
I mean, and you can say that the Red Ring of Death thing was a big debacle too, but

18:04.760 --> 18:09.280
you know, remember, Microsoft kind of finally, it took them long enough, they kind of came

18:09.280 --> 18:13.160
out and admitted fault for that, and they were generally able to get over that whole

18:13.160 --> 18:14.160
thing.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.800
Whereas, I don't know, this is still really fresh in people's minds, we're still going

18:17.800 --> 18:21.080
to have lawsuits after this that have yet to be settled and so on.

18:21.080 --> 18:26.180
This is not over today, I mean, PlayStation Network is still not 100% back up.

18:26.180 --> 18:30.640
You can't buy games online right now, and if you're a developer, that kind of sucks.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.640
You know what I mean?

18:31.640 --> 18:32.640
Yeah.

18:32.640 --> 18:39.880
Yeah, I don't know if you read one of the stories, well, there's some ridiculous stories,

18:39.880 --> 18:44.960
you know, regarding this whole thing, but I mean, I don't know.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.760
For me, it doesn't really matter, because I'm never on PlayStation Network, so it just

18:49.760 --> 18:56.640
was an inconvenience because now I had to wait to activate my Steam copy of Portal 2.

18:56.640 --> 19:04.200
Well, technically I didn't have to wait, but you know, it was such a non-event for me.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.200
I was like, eh, whatever.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.200
So I'm not on it.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.400
I can't be on it.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
Don't care.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.240
Oh, actually, this is late breaking.

19:12.240 --> 19:17.040
There's another video that was just released by Sony of Kazurai giving an update as to

19:17.040 --> 19:19.480
what's going on on PlayStation Network.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.280
Let's take a look and see what's going on in this latest announcement from Kazurai.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.840
Bueller?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.400
Bueller?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.920
Bueller?

19:27.920 --> 19:29.360
Bueller?

19:29.360 --> 19:30.680
Bueller?

19:30.680 --> 19:38.480
Oh, I guess the Bueller network will be coming back soon, I don't know.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.680
All right, there you go.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
Anyhow.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.960
I have some more PlayStation updates and what's going on.

19:45.960 --> 19:51.760
Actually, mentioning about developers being pissed off, apparently publishers and developers

19:51.760 --> 19:54.560
obviously have been out quite a bit of money.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.040
You know, that's three weeks of lost sales and then some.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.440
Again, the story is not back up just yet.

20:00.440 --> 20:04.800
Apparently, Sony was not telling the developers and publishers really anything.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.320
They only had the same information that the rest of us had.

20:08.320 --> 20:12.040
Sony finally sent out a letter to its publishing partners.

20:12.040 --> 20:17.080
It was sent out three weeks after the PlayStation Network went down, which is interesting.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.680
Here's a clip of the letter.

20:18.680 --> 20:23.880
Dear partner, as you know, certain PlayStation Network curiosity is, which by the way is

20:23.880 --> 20:25.880
how you pronounce it, not core-yorosity.

20:25.880 --> 20:26.880
Curiosity?

20:26.880 --> 20:27.880
Queue.

20:27.880 --> 20:28.880
Curiosity.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.880
Curiosity.

20:29.880 --> 20:33.560
Well, I don't care.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.760
Once again, I don't care.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.440
Whoa, you're so clever for putting a queue there and making me try to figure out how

20:38.440 --> 20:40.760
to pronounce a fucking thing.

20:40.760 --> 20:41.760
Guess what?

20:41.760 --> 20:45.800
It's a service I don't fucking care to use, so I don't care to fucking know how to pronounce

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
it either.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.920
As you know, blah, blah, blah, account information was compromised, criminal attacks, blah, blah,

20:50.920 --> 20:51.920
blah.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.960
I want to assure you as a PlayStation partner that it is Sony's top priority to restore

20:54.960 --> 20:59.120
our network operations and see that business is returned to usual as soon as possible.

20:59.120 --> 21:03.040
We are working around the clock to restore service, but we'll do so only when we can

21:03.040 --> 21:07.680
ensure that the network can operate safely and securely, blah, blah, blah.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.320
And then they go over exactly what happened, which really is all the stuff that you would

21:11.320 --> 21:15.960
have got just reading the internet and the various game blogs and what's going on.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.160
Let's see.

21:17.160 --> 21:22.600
As a valued partner, we aim to keep the lines of communication open so that you are aware

21:22.600 --> 21:24.320
of our progress.

21:24.320 --> 21:29.080
Our focus has been to confirm the security of the networks, protect customer data, and

21:29.080 --> 21:32.080
get the services back online as quickly as possible.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.560
We will do our best to respond to all of your inquiries and we will do everything we can

21:35.560 --> 21:36.880
to possibly support you.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.700
I mean, that is a load of crap if I've ever heard it.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.000
We aim to keep the lines of communication open.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.560
So that's why you're regurgitating what every news outlet has been saying for the past three

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
weeks.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
That sucks.

21:50.560 --> 21:55.960
If I was a PlayStation Network developer, I would be so mad about this.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.120
Why weren't you upfront with us sooner?

21:59.120 --> 22:03.440
And it's really going to give me pause in developing a PlayStation Network exclusive.

22:03.440 --> 22:09.060
Sony is really going to have to, you know, as their game plan to get up and going again,

22:09.060 --> 22:12.980
they're really going to have to shell out money for exclusive agreements.

22:12.980 --> 22:16.240
It's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.

22:16.240 --> 22:20.800
Anyhow, some other stuff with the whole PlayStation breach.

22:20.800 --> 22:25.440
There's a rumor going around that a rented Amazon server was actually used to launch

22:25.440 --> 22:30.520
the attack, which is interesting because Amazon was having all their issues, you know, and

22:30.520 --> 22:35.360
the web service, not the, not the same portion of Amazon that sells the books and CDs.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.720
We have to remember Amazon is a very large service and they also sell like web hosting

22:39.720 --> 22:40.720
as part of their service.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.200
And you might remember that a bunch of sites they hosted went down, which was a big deal

22:44.200 --> 22:48.000
for Amazon because they have like, you know, service level agreements that were being broken

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
and so forth.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.160
Well, according to Bloomberg News, they are saying that the hackers who actually hacked

22:54.160 --> 22:58.760
PlayStation Network rented a server from Amazon.com to do so, signing up for the service using

22:58.760 --> 23:00.240
fake information.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.800
Hmm.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.800
Interesting theory.

23:02.800 --> 23:09.800
But, you know, pardon my ignorance, but how would this server be used to hack PlayStation

23:09.800 --> 23:10.800
Network?

23:10.800 --> 23:14.160
I mean, a DDoS is one thing, but that's not what we're talking about happened here.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.120
This is not a simple DDoS.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.200
Somebody got in there and the information got exposed.

23:19.200 --> 23:24.320
So how does that work using a cloud, uh, the cloud computer?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.760
I mean, I just don't know enough about hacking Loki.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.760
Any ideas?

23:27.760 --> 23:32.000
Well, if they're brute forcing something, the more computers they have working on it,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
the faster it goes.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Hmm.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.100
Well, you can, it can be guaranteed that if this is true, you can see a subpoena will

23:38.100 --> 23:41.880
be going to out to Amazon very soon to try and figure out, you know, whose credit card

23:41.880 --> 23:46.960
was used to sign up, which if that ends up being true, that was, um, it was kind of dumb

23:46.960 --> 23:50.840
the hackers to do, but they probably used a fake or stolen credit card.

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
Yeah, I'm sure.

23:51.840 --> 23:55.800
Oh, we'll put all the real, you know, we'll put fake names, but the credit card, we'll

23:55.800 --> 24:00.680
put a real credit card or a real credit card name or something like that.

24:00.680 --> 24:01.680
Hmm.

24:01.680 --> 24:09.920
Uh, also one other quick thing, uh, about, um, this whole thing, uh, retailers are saying

24:09.920 --> 24:14.400
that PlayStation three owners are just ditching the platform altogether and migrating to the

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
360.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.800
This is gonna be ironic, hold on, just real quick.

24:17.800 --> 24:22.240
You know, uh, one of the stories that came out before they were saying that there was

24:22.240 --> 24:27.240
people that were hacking the PlayStation three using the, um, you know, the, it's a new custom

24:27.240 --> 24:31.900
firmware called re, was it a re-bug or something like that.

24:31.900 --> 24:35.800
And basically it gave them access to like the developer side of things where you can

24:35.800 --> 24:42.100
buy PlayStation content using this, uh, credit card number that they had or whatever that

24:42.100 --> 24:47.080
was associated with the developer stuff that allowed them to add, you know, funds to their

24:47.080 --> 24:49.600
account and buy stuff without actually spending real money.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
Oh yeah.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.040
Wouldn't it be ironic if they use that credit card number?

24:53.040 --> 24:56.160
That would be hilarious.

24:56.160 --> 25:02.000
Uh, apparently a lot of people were canceling their pre-orders for brink, uh, for the PlayStation

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
three.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.520
Uh, lots of stuff going on in the used market, which I think dark soccer is going to get

25:06.520 --> 25:11.800
into in a minute here, but, uh, yeah, lots of PlayStation threes being traded in.

25:11.800 --> 25:16.160
People going to Xbox three 60 again, this is just from a source in Belgium.

25:16.160 --> 25:23.180
Uh, you know, I'm sure, I'm sure there's an increase over normal, but I'm not sure if

25:23.180 --> 25:27.280
it's a, Oh shit, PlayStation is damned a situation yet.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.400
I mean people, I mean, if you're that fickle that you're going to just, you know, dump

25:31.400 --> 25:35.720
your system because the networks down for a couple of weeks, then whatever, then you're

25:35.720 --> 25:39.900
going to be, then you're going to be fickle enough to, you know, buy the system again

25:39.900 --> 25:43.240
later on when there's something that you want to play on it, cause that's, what's going

25:43.240 --> 25:44.240
to end up happening.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.400
I mean, live goes down every once in a while for a day and stuff.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.720
You don't see people like running on mass, you know, selling their console.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.480
To be fair, it doesn't go down because somebody stole my credit card information.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.000
It's never been down for 22 days.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
True.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.640
You know, there is a big difference than that, but I just think, you know, I do think selling

26:04.640 --> 26:10.080
your PlayStation on this alone might be a little bit throwing out the baby with the

26:10.080 --> 26:11.760
bathwater a little bit.

26:11.760 --> 26:16.440
I mean, I, I, there could be that exclusive that comes out that makes you kind of want

26:16.440 --> 26:17.720
to come back sorta.

26:17.720 --> 26:23.400
I mean, if you, if you sell this and you mean it, then Hey, everybody has that right to

26:23.400 --> 26:28.360
make those types of choices, but I just, I know too many people that sell systems only

26:28.360 --> 26:33.560
to buy them back when the game they really want comes out, kind of like the 3DS, like

26:33.560 --> 26:37.720
if you're selling a 3DS back already, you really should question why you bought one

26:37.720 --> 26:38.720
in the first place.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.800
I mean, that's really the underlying problem right now.

26:41.800 --> 26:47.040
I mean, everybody knows the 3DS lineup right now is weak at best.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.680
So, but there's going to be much better 3DS games by the end of the year between the Kid

26:51.680 --> 26:55.320
Icarus, the assumed Mario game that's going to be announced at E3 and so forth.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.800
There'll be more reasons to have it.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.360
So why sell back a 3DS now just to buy one six months later?

27:00.360 --> 27:04.120
So, but there are people, I mean, and there are going to be a certain percentage of people

27:04.120 --> 27:06.160
that just feel so violated by this whole thing.

27:06.160 --> 27:12.000
They've sworn off Sony and this could damage the PlayStation 4 later on.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
But I don't know.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.240
I think it's a bit too early to really see the full ramifications.

27:16.240 --> 27:20.000
I think it is so important more than ever this year to really see what Sony's bringing

27:20.000 --> 27:22.280
out the big guns this year at E3.

27:22.280 --> 27:27.680
But you know, I'm not exactly loving the fact that Sony's PlayStation network was down for

27:27.680 --> 27:30.840
22 days, that my credit card information was stolen.

27:30.840 --> 27:35.320
But at the same token, I kind of keep going back and forth on that crap, too.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.560
They're like, oh, well, we have no evidence that it actually was stolen.

27:39.560 --> 27:44.560
Oh, well, but you still want to, you know, be sure and take all these safety precautions.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.860
Oh, but we have really no evidence that's been stolen.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.280
They're going back and forth on it.

27:49.280 --> 27:53.840
Just like say, listen, it's been compromised and be done with it.

27:53.840 --> 27:58.640
People will say, well, you know, there's really no evidence that they looked at it.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.640
You know, they have the data.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
They stole all of it.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
Who knows?

28:01.640 --> 28:04.640
They maybe just deleted the file and said, pat themselves on the back and say, good job

28:04.640 --> 28:05.640
me.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.640
I hacked Sony.

28:06.640 --> 28:13.600
So, um, I just, it's going to be interesting because later on this year you still have

28:13.600 --> 28:17.320
some big, you know, The Last Guardian is a game that a lot of people are foaming at the

28:17.320 --> 28:18.320
mouth over.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.640
So it's very, it's going to be like, you know, will people forgive us if the games are good

28:23.640 --> 28:24.640
enough?

28:24.640 --> 28:28.040
It's going to be very, very interesting these next few months.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.360
So anyhow, let's move on.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.880
I think Dark Sakura has a little more to add to this whole retail angle.

28:33.880 --> 28:42.160
Well, actually there is a notice that at least in the U S that, uh, diff 10 of the most popular

28:42.160 --> 28:49.520
online titles that were for PlayStation three dropped by an average of 7.4%, um, basically

28:49.520 --> 28:51.720
since the 20th of April.

28:51.720 --> 28:58.560
And then the same 10 titles saw a 0.7% increase on Xbox three 60 for sales.

28:58.560 --> 29:04.600
Also, um, uh, one of the UK retailers was reporting that they had double the amount

29:04.600 --> 29:11.160
of PS threes being brought in and then half of those people picking up an Xbox three 60

29:11.160 --> 29:18.240
that also sales of, uh, use titles have just completely been borked by PS three going to

29:18.240 --> 29:24.520
sell like two coming in at four.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.520
It's all fuzzy map.

29:25.520 --> 29:34.400
It sounds like, well, at any rate, I, most people really are that fickle and it's, it's

29:34.400 --> 29:39.560
really people in general I think are just so fickle that they're going to not put up

29:39.560 --> 29:44.560
with any type of inconvenience when high real life doesn't always work out for you.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.920
You're going to have to wait.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.080
I didn't care.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.880
Let's go to the chat room at chat dot orange lunch radio dot com for some feedback going

29:50.880 --> 29:51.880
on right now.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.360
A game guru in our chat room says red ring of death and PlayStation network being hacked

29:55.360 --> 30:00.060
are only comparable in terms of showing the deficiencies that Microsoft and Sony has.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.060
Kind of interesting.

30:01.060 --> 30:05.880
Yes, because Microsoft was always a software company and then they were getting into hardware.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.880
But you know, in Microsoft though, I think that their response was a little bit better

30:09.880 --> 30:10.880
than Sony's.

30:10.880 --> 30:16.360
I mean, at least I granted they, I don't think they ever really admitted how many are affected.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.400
Trust me, it's more than the 1% that they were quoting.

30:19.400 --> 30:25.440
It's every single one, every single, every single one launch, every single one will be

30:25.440 --> 30:28.000
absolutely be affected.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.880
If you have one that's from the launch, you know, 2005 or whatever, and it's still working

30:32.880 --> 30:35.520
today, that's a fluke.

30:35.520 --> 30:36.520
Trust me.

30:36.520 --> 30:41.720
I, I know every single one will die a salacious pop responding to something you just said

30:41.720 --> 30:42.760
a little bit ago.

30:42.760 --> 30:47.240
I think Loki is under recognizing the huge dude broke contingent who only play black

30:47.240 --> 30:49.800
ops battlefield, modern warfare all day.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.240
And that's all they play.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.680
And they're Sony geeks and never got into halo.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.760
Or I would add to that that the Blu-ray player was enticing.

30:56.760 --> 31:01.760
I mean, like it or not, the Blu-ray factor being in the PlayStation three is still selling

31:01.760 --> 31:06.560
a lot of those over Xbox three six to the dude broke contingent that salacious pop brings

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
up.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.000
Not the audience that would be listening to this show, but the people that are like, Oh,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.840
this thing plays Blu-rays and it plays modern warfare.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
Cool.

31:13.840 --> 31:20.480
You know, well, first of all, your Blu-ray player will still work and it's back up.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.800
So what's the problem?

31:21.800 --> 31:26.580
Oh, those people that it took my credit card info.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.080
So you gave them your credit card info.

31:29.080 --> 31:33.960
Well, on top of that, just call the bank and change your shit.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.800
You know, a little inconvenience for your own security.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.800
Sorry.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.800
You're going to have to deal with it.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.800
You're going to end up, uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says, I don't know, call me crazy, but

31:42.800 --> 31:46.460
I'd rather have my three 60 red ring of death than my private information stolen.

31:46.460 --> 31:47.460
That's just me.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.320
If you say it's the same, then you obviously don't know what it's like to have your credit

31:50.320 --> 31:52.040
card or identity stolen.

31:52.040 --> 31:58.240
Uh, I still don't give a shit because if somebody tries to use my number, guess what?

31:58.240 --> 32:02.320
We'll call and cancel the card and then they'll trace it back to whoever did it.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.760
Don't care.

32:03.760 --> 32:04.760
Really don't care.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.120
Well, it's going to be, I mean, if that happens, you're going to care when it happens.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.800
If it happens at a bad time, but it's not gonna affect my credit.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.540
It's not going to affect my finances.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.540
It will.

32:15.540 --> 32:20.580
All the funds will be frozen and I'll get a new card and hopefully they'll catch whoever

32:20.580 --> 32:21.580
did it.

32:21.580 --> 32:22.580
Other than that.

32:22.580 --> 32:23.580
Don't give a shit.

32:23.580 --> 32:24.580
Yeah.

32:24.580 --> 32:25.580
And I said this a couple of weeks before on the show.

32:25.580 --> 32:28.860
If somebody were to use this credit card information has been stolen, you're really an idiot and

32:28.860 --> 32:33.560
you're just asking to, uh, get caught for this whole thing.

32:33.560 --> 32:38.040
I mean, the FBI is on this now, you know, they're just waiting for someone to fuck this

32:38.040 --> 32:41.420
up and give away how this all, you know, kind of happened.

32:41.420 --> 32:48.200
So and also the amount of information they actually got, um, you know, it's going to

32:48.200 --> 32:51.120
take them forever to parse through that stuff anyways.

32:51.120 --> 32:56.460
So yeah, there is a, there is the risks that your identity might be stolen or something

32:56.460 --> 33:02.600
like that, but it's, I think it's very unlikely even even still, I think they'll catch them

33:02.600 --> 33:08.640
before they even come close to parsing through all the data that's on there.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.640
I agree with this comment in our chat room.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.080
Defective candy at chat, that orange sounds radio.com says, if someone tries to use my

33:14.080 --> 33:16.460
credit card, guess what sucks to be them.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.460
I'm broke.

33:17.460 --> 33:27.440
I was just thinking that, you know, I really, I really, okay, wasting time freaking out

33:27.440 --> 33:30.520
over this is really exactly just that.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.320
Wasting time.

33:32.320 --> 33:35.640
All you're doing is working yourself up.

33:35.640 --> 33:39.500
You selling your PlayStation three is going to mean you're not going to be able to play

33:39.500 --> 33:40.500
whatever that is.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.960
It's going to come out later and then you're going to have to spend more money to get another

33:43.960 --> 33:46.280
one if you want to play it badly enough.

33:46.280 --> 33:51.360
So in the end, lacking patience just makes you a loser.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
That's it.

33:52.360 --> 33:57.320
Well, but I, at the same time, I can understand where somebody is going to sell their PlayStation

33:57.320 --> 33:58.320
three back over this.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.320
I really do.

33:59.320 --> 34:04.600
But I just would say, think ahead cause you don't want to do something reactive only to

34:04.600 --> 34:08.240
get sweetened back by Sony later on.

34:08.240 --> 34:13.000
We also still don't know what they plan to do to kind of wrong the right or excuse me,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
right?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Wrong.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
The right, right?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
The wrong.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.600
And uh, you know what they're going to give as part of this, I guess you could see severance

34:18.600 --> 34:20.760
package or whatever to kind of come back to the place.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.760
Wait, wait, wait.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.760
You don't know.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.960
Didn't you see the party look in Kaz's eyes?

34:25.960 --> 34:29.200
It's obvious that he's going to throw one hell of a party.

34:29.200 --> 34:32.160
That guy is a party animal.

34:32.160 --> 34:37.080
And again, I, all I know, if I was thinking of selling my PlayStation three back, I'd

34:37.080 --> 34:40.720
kind of be waiting until after E3 to make sure I really want to do it.

34:40.720 --> 34:45.720
I'm not selling my fucking PS3 back because it's a fully backwards compatible PS3 with

34:45.720 --> 34:50.360
the 500 gig hard drive in it that I don't play on the PlayStation network and hardly

34:50.360 --> 34:51.480
ever buy games for.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.540
So you know, I'm content with it.

34:54.540 --> 34:56.040
I use it for Blu-rays.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.040
Great.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.040
You know what?

34:58.040 --> 35:02.000
If there's a Sony game that really is awesome that I have to have, I can get it.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.720
But for everything else that's multi-platform, you better believe it.

35:04.720 --> 35:09.320
I'm getting in on the Xbox 360 because that's just what I play more.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.640
It's more convenient for me.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.040
PS3 sucked up to the front TV.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.160
Nelly wants to play Animal Crossing still.

35:16.160 --> 35:19.440
So, you know, all right.

35:19.440 --> 35:23.360
I feel like it's been PlayStation network all the time for the past three weeks.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.060
Believe it or not, there is news in other parts of the gaming world and I think it's

35:26.060 --> 35:27.400
time we took a trip there.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
How about Xbox?

35:28.400 --> 35:31.200
Let's talk about something going on in the 360 world, Loki.

35:31.200 --> 35:35.860
Well, remember they were beta testing an update that's gonna change kind of the disk format

35:35.860 --> 35:36.860
a little bit.

35:36.860 --> 35:44.560
They're gonna allow developers to use another gigabyte of space that was dedicated for like

35:44.560 --> 35:47.640
a video partition that basically says Xbox.

35:47.640 --> 35:52.700
It's a little swirl logo thing that lets you know, hey, dumbass, that's not a DVD movie.

35:52.700 --> 35:54.240
It is an Xbox game.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.340
But you know what?

35:55.340 --> 36:00.560
I think most people can figure out that it's an Xbox game.

36:00.560 --> 36:03.200
They don't need a little video that shows that.

36:03.200 --> 36:07.000
So get that out of the way and you have more space for storing stuff.

36:07.000 --> 36:14.400
So along with that, there's also gonna be, you know, some other updates including PayPal.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.240
It's coming on May 19th, which is interesting.

36:17.240 --> 36:23.280
You'll be able to use your PayPal account to add funds for buying an Xbox Live Marketplace

36:23.280 --> 36:24.840
materials and whatnot.

36:24.840 --> 36:29.360
Extremely interesting in light of everything that's going on at Sony, that you can kind

36:29.360 --> 36:31.800
of use a middleman now.

36:31.800 --> 36:36.240
Instead of having to give your information directly to Microsoft, you could use a, for

36:36.240 --> 36:41.380
better or worse, trusted payment delivery source, although I don't know if giving your

36:41.380 --> 36:45.080
info to PayPal is any better or worse than giving it to Microsoft, to be honest.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.400
And then Avatar Connect, that's coming May 27th.

36:48.400 --> 36:53.220
That's the, you know, program that you can chat with your friends and, you know, use

36:53.220 --> 36:57.440
the connect to move your avatar around, kind of like a talk show almost.

36:57.440 --> 37:02.360
This sounds kind of weird to me because don't they have a video chat program as it is right

37:02.360 --> 37:03.360
now?

37:03.360 --> 37:05.440
They do, but you can't wave around as your avatar.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
Okay.

37:06.440 --> 37:10.000
So this is for people who don't want to be seen as themselves.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
They want to be seen as their avatar online in chat.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yes.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.100
So this is for like pedophiles and ugly people like, no, I mean, no offense to the ugly people

37:19.100 --> 37:20.960
out there, but like, right?

37:20.960 --> 37:23.480
Like why would you just use video chat?

37:23.480 --> 37:24.480
Yeah.

37:24.480 --> 37:30.080
Um, and then of course, you know, as I mentioned, uh, the, uh, XGD3, uh, that's the new format

37:30.080 --> 37:32.120
that's going to be for the disks.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.480
The other thing is, of course, they're going to be adding some more copy protection.

37:35.480 --> 37:39.320
It's also going to be flashing all of those people that have flash modded drives.

37:39.320 --> 37:44.480
It's going to be flashing those drives back to their stock firmwares and going to be,

37:44.480 --> 37:48.280
um, fixing it in a way where you can't change it.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.560
Well, you can't easily change it.

37:50.560 --> 37:56.240
We'll get to that a little bit later, but a neat, you know, that also saves me a step

37:56.240 --> 38:01.880
because I have one flash system still that we, it was leftover from, I just didn't want

38:01.880 --> 38:06.160
to bother the flash it back and now I don't have to, they're going to do it for me.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.160
Awesome.

38:07.160 --> 38:11.880
I, what do you think about this news of what's coming out in the Xbox three spring update?

38:11.880 --> 38:14.000
I mean, usually these updates are pretty exciting.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.640
There's at least one little tidbit in there where you're like, Oh, that's going to be

38:16.640 --> 38:20.200
awesome to have like the, I don't know, like the USB storage or whatever, but this time

38:20.200 --> 38:25.720
around I'm looking at the updates going, eh, none of this, I mean, PayPal, okay.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.040
I don't know who would use that, but not me.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.440
Uh, I'd use it.

38:29.440 --> 38:35.000
I mean, if I was buying a lot of content on Xbox live, I'd use it because I sell a lot

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
of shit on eBay.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.040
So I have, I usually, when I'm not dumping my funds back into my bank account, I usually

38:41.040 --> 38:42.680
have quite a bit sitting in my PayPal account.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.680
I guess I can get that.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.460
See, I don't, I don't really use PayPal like that.

38:45.460 --> 38:47.880
Like I use PayPal to pay for Skype and that's about it.

38:47.880 --> 38:51.720
And that's cause I, we've been using Skype ever since they were like a company based

38:51.720 --> 38:56.160
in the UK and it was actually very easy to do the international funds through PayPal.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.360
Um, so that's why I have a PayPal account.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.360
I don't use it for anything.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.200
I also use, I use it a lot for just buying stuff online.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.520
I buy a lot of stuff on eBay.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.320
I buy a lot of stuff like subscriptions for things.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.960
I'll pay for that.

39:08.960 --> 39:13.000
That makes sense though, that for those people that actually use PayPal as a wallet from

39:13.000 --> 39:17.360
like eBay and things like that, that is kind of a neat way to be able to pay for the games.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.440
It's online for eBay and Dan uses it for his RC cars.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.440
All right, I get it.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.840
I guess that is a little bit more exciting, but I don't know.

39:23.840 --> 39:24.840
But once again.

39:24.840 --> 39:25.840
Let's talk about me again.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
I am not excited.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.840
There's nothing in it for me.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.840
Yeah.

39:28.840 --> 39:33.240
See, I don't buy a lot of download content anymore for games other than like maybe like

39:33.240 --> 39:34.960
a Grand Theft Auto or something like that.

39:34.960 --> 39:40.500
I probably wouldn't buy, you know, download content for a lot of things.

39:40.500 --> 39:44.360
I may or may not have bought Dan Central songs the other day.

39:44.360 --> 39:59.760
You know, I have certain hardware configurations in various places that facilitate the ability

39:59.760 --> 40:05.720
to not have to purchase that stuff and yet enjoy the full range of content.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.680
I think that's the place where I can say that.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.280
But yeah, I really don't buy a lot.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.640
Mainly because, you know, look at what I'm playing each week, Grand Theft Auto, Grand

40:14.640 --> 40:15.640
Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.760
I mean, there's not any new content coming out for that, so there's nothing for me to

40:18.760 --> 40:19.760
buy.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.760
DJ Hero.

40:20.760 --> 40:21.760
You know, Grand Theft Auto 5.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.760
You know, 1.5.

40:22.760 --> 40:23.760
Yeah.

40:23.760 --> 40:24.760
Hell yeah.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.760
1.5.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.760
Anything they put out, I'll buy.

40:26.760 --> 40:30.360
I mean, that's just, you know, the way it is.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.080
All right.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.560
Let me move on to a story about something that maybe you'll be using your PayPal money

40:36.560 --> 40:37.560
to download.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.560
I don't know.

40:38.560 --> 40:44.360
Sega has been an ESRB rating that's come out for the Genesis game Monster World 4 coming

40:44.360 --> 40:47.200
out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.840
Now, that kind of spilled the news a little early.

40:49.840 --> 40:55.520
Sega of Europe actually confirmed that they are bringing the game over to PlayStation

40:55.520 --> 40:57.640
Network and Wii Virtual Console.

40:57.640 --> 41:00.860
So odd that they left Xbox Live Arcade out of that, but whatever.

41:00.860 --> 41:02.640
Maybe something's happening in the future.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.800
I don't know.

41:04.800 --> 41:08.000
There's gonna be a vintage collection that actually comes out later in the year.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.960
You know, they've been milking those Genesis games for all their worth and there's still

41:11.960 --> 41:14.680
people that will pay five bucks a game for it, so whatever.

41:14.680 --> 41:19.040
This collection is gonna have Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Revenge of Shinobi, Alex Kidd

41:19.040 --> 41:22.200
in Miracle World, Wonder Boy in Monster World.

41:22.200 --> 41:27.480
Now, all those games have already come out on the Virtual Console here in North America.

41:27.480 --> 41:32.800
But the interesting thing about this, Monster World 4, it was never actually officially

41:32.800 --> 41:35.920
released on a console outside of Japan.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.080
And get this.

41:37.080 --> 41:40.020
It's gonna be localized as a part of this collection.

41:40.020 --> 41:47.320
So Sega is actually localizing this ages-old, what is this, 94, I think, game?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.320
Wasn't this first game?

41:48.320 --> 41:49.320
Don't say that, Rob.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.320
It was, uh, sorry.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.680
That's when I graduated.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.680
I don't write the news.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
I just report it.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.400
As, uh, trolls would say on the internet, Sega does but intend don't.

41:57.400 --> 42:03.120
In other words, localizing an old game that maybe fans might want to play just because

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
they can.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
That's the best zing I've heard on a show.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.120
Hey, Joe Aniki came out.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.120
Don't say that.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.120
What's that?

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
Joe Aniki came out.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
But that's not a Nintendo game.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.120
They didn't translate it.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
Yeah, it wasn't Nintendo.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.280
They didn't, yeah, when Sin and Punishment, the original came out, they didn't bother

42:15.280 --> 42:16.280
to translate it.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.800
I mean, a lot of those games didn't need translation, but this is really the first time that they've

42:19.800 --> 42:21.840
gone back and actually are gonna translate a game.

42:21.840 --> 42:27.480
Now, I can't imagine Monster World 4 has the epic dialogue of a role-playing game, but

42:27.480 --> 42:31.040
it's probably got, what, it's kind of a Mario-y style game, right?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.460
Sort of a side-scrolling adventure game, right?

42:33.460 --> 42:35.560
So it's probably got a decent amount of dialogue.

42:35.560 --> 42:38.720
It's kind of neat that they're localizing it.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.920
But at the same time, if I have to buy this whole big collection with all these other

42:41.920 --> 42:44.040
Genesis games just to get it, I don't know.

42:44.040 --> 42:49.240
And I gotta be honest, well, I don't know, I hear Monster World 4 is really, really good

42:49.240 --> 42:55.080
and I'm missing a lot by not playing it, but my desire to go and pay money for this old

42:55.080 --> 42:59.000
94 game, I don't know, I just, I'm not, like, super excited about it.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.760
I just think there's other stuff in the gaming world my money would be spent on.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.440
But I guess I'll wait and see when this comes out.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.640
Maybe everybody will be like, you have to play it, it's great, and we were missing so

43:07.640 --> 43:08.720
much before.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.880
A good game is still a good game at the end of the day, right?

43:11.880 --> 43:12.880
So.

43:12.880 --> 43:13.880
Alright, moving on.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.660
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

43:15.660 --> 43:20.760
I have other news related to Disney, although I, okay, this is, I'm first gonna point out

43:20.760 --> 43:24.880
something that I totally loathe that this article does.

43:24.880 --> 43:29.840
Okay, the article says, Disney Studio coughs up 3 million for violating kiddie gamer's

43:29.840 --> 43:31.320
privacy.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.520
But Disney didn't do it.

43:32.520 --> 43:39.120
It was titles that had been acquired before Disney acquired Playdom, which is their online

43:39.120 --> 43:40.760
kids gaming thing.

43:40.760 --> 43:45.840
So to say Disney did it, yeah, Disney may have accepted all the liability, but it wasn't

43:45.840 --> 43:49.280
Disney that did it, and I hate when titles are misleading like that, so.

43:49.280 --> 43:57.280
But at any rate, Playdom, which is the Disney social game studios, paid 3 million dollars

43:57.280 --> 44:03.300
as a settlement for titles that were there before Playdom acquired, I'm sorry, that were

44:03.300 --> 44:09.440
acquired by Playdom before Disney acquired it, were collecting kids' ages and email addresses

44:09.440 --> 44:12.080
without parental consent.

44:12.080 --> 44:14.740
It was posted without parental consent.

44:14.740 --> 44:16.740
So Disney coughed up the cash for it.

44:16.740 --> 44:19.440
And isn't, there is some type of law where like if you're under 13.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.440
It's COPA.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.440
Yeah.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.440
Yeah.

44:22.440 --> 44:27.480
So basically, um, you know, they have to have consent to be able to do something like that,

44:27.480 --> 44:31.400
and it was a game called Pony Stars, which was like a My Little Pony game.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.800
Oh shit, my information probably got compromised.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.200
Oh Rob.

44:36.200 --> 44:40.120
But basically, these were all done by Acclaim.

44:40.120 --> 44:42.440
At the time, it was under Acclaim's management.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.880
Uh, the Curse of Acclaim.

44:44.880 --> 44:46.000
Yeah.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.800
And then Playdom bought out Acclaim.

44:48.800 --> 44:49.800
So.

44:49.800 --> 44:56.600
But actually, the former Acclaim CEO, Howard Marks, is also being named in the case.

44:56.600 --> 44:57.600
Oh snap.

44:57.600 --> 45:05.160
So I would say, uh, you know, whoever holds whatever rights are left, you know, Disney

45:05.160 --> 45:07.240
needs to go after them.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.480
Um, it's really tricky, especially when you're talking about games marketed towards kids.

45:11.480 --> 45:15.460
Like a lot of kids, you know what game comes to mind for me is that Smurfs Village game

45:15.460 --> 45:19.760
on iOS has taken a lot of heat and that's a Capcom game, if I'm not mistaken.

45:19.760 --> 45:24.000
The Smurfs Village game, because of how easy it is for kids to get sucked into that game

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
and buy the little Smurf Berries, like, you know, it's just touch, touch, touch to do

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
it.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.280
And you buy those, like you've heard these stories of kids spending hundreds of dollars

45:32.280 --> 45:36.740
on these dumb ass Smurf Berries to make things grow faster in the game, but you know, a lot

45:36.740 --> 45:42.880
of 10 year olds who don't have a true concept of money don't understand that.

45:42.880 --> 45:43.880
I think back to when-

45:43.880 --> 45:48.160
And parents that don't have a concept of parenting don't understand that their kids are buying

45:48.160 --> 45:53.240
stuff through their phone.

45:53.240 --> 45:57.520
I think it's funny though, cause I think back to a time when I was probably like 14 or 15

45:57.520 --> 46:02.160
and I was on Prodigy and Prodigy used to charge for using chat rooms and one month I ran up

46:02.160 --> 46:06.280
like a $90 bill in the chat room or something like that and my mother, oh God, I never heard

46:06.280 --> 46:07.280
the end of it.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.280
You guys never heard the end of it.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.800
Yeah, we did the same thing in Prodigy, but it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily because of

46:12.800 --> 46:15.800
the, um, the chat room.

46:15.800 --> 46:21.080
It was because, um, the number that it picked to dial was long distance.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.080
No.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.080
Yeah.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.080
That's not good.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.080
Love dialing.

46:26.080 --> 46:32.600
See, I used to have the hookup on AOL back in the day because I dialed in on an 800 number.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.080
I thought you had to pay for that.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.080
And had a free account.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.840
I was gonna say, I thought you had to pay for the 800 number.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.680
I was a chat room host for Cartoon Network.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.540
It was almost impossible not to have a free account through AOL because you'd threaten

46:43.540 --> 46:50.240
to cancel or, you know, they'd just send you another 72, you know, day trial or whatever.

46:50.240 --> 46:54.240
Just a ridiculous amount of 720 hour trial.

46:54.240 --> 46:58.080
That's what it was, you know, oh, wait, that's 30 days.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.080
Awesome.

46:59.080 --> 47:07.700
Uh, yeah, but I'm referring to back when it was like $3 an hour or something.

47:07.700 --> 47:10.480
Back when it had just gotten out of DOS.

47:10.480 --> 47:14.560
Rama in the chat room says, Sky, if she didn't beat you with the belt, you got off lucky.

47:14.560 --> 47:15.560
LOL.

47:15.560 --> 47:16.560
No.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.880
All the abuse in my household was always emotional, never physical.

47:18.880 --> 47:19.880
Alright.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.740
That's not abuse.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.520
Let's move on.

47:24.520 --> 47:30.720
Let's move on and talk about release dates and what's coming out to a store near you

47:30.720 --> 47:31.800
depending on where you live.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.480
We'll start with the US.

47:33.480 --> 47:34.480
Not much this week.

47:34.480 --> 47:39.200
LA Noire on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 being the biggest title of the week.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.920
It's kind of a big title, right?

47:40.920 --> 47:42.320
Yeah, just a little bit.

47:42.320 --> 47:47.960
The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings on PC, coming out from Atari.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.560
The First Templar on Xbox 360.

47:51.560 --> 47:57.040
Spongebob Squigglepants for the 3DS, this is the game that's sort of like Warioware,

47:57.040 --> 48:00.620
but here it's terrible, so, you know, keep that in mind.

48:00.620 --> 48:03.240
Another terrible title for the 3DS.

48:03.240 --> 48:04.240
Cake Man-

48:04.240 --> 48:05.240
What a shock!

48:05.240 --> 48:06.240
Yeah, shocker.

48:06.240 --> 48:10.960
Cake Mania Main Street for the Nintendo DS, I'm sure it's all like the other Cake Mania

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
games.

48:11.960 --> 48:17.440
Fable 3 on PC this week.

48:17.440 --> 48:18.440
And that's it.

48:18.440 --> 48:21.140
Alright, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there.

48:21.140 --> 48:25.960
You get your version of Portal 2 this week on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, those

48:25.960 --> 48:28.060
coming out on May the 19th.

48:28.060 --> 48:31.160
And yeah, those are like localized versions for Japan.

48:31.160 --> 48:36.200
I don't know if they have all new voice actors or if it uses subtitles or what, but yeah,

48:36.200 --> 48:39.400
they're getting their own version of Portal 2 so they can get in on the fun that we're

48:39.400 --> 48:40.400
having over here.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.460
Again, that's on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

48:43.460 --> 48:46.200
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week, excuse me, is a price reduction, not

48:46.200 --> 48:50.560
a new game, but FIFA Soccer 11 moves into the best hit series from EA, it's like it's

48:50.560 --> 48:53.360
a big price reduction in Japan this week.

48:53.360 --> 48:58.400
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nuttin' this week, what a surprise, the Nintendo 3DS Dead

48:58.400 --> 49:02.140
or Alive Dimensions finally gets its release this week in Japan, so I'm sure we'll be hearing

49:02.140 --> 49:07.460
some reports on that game and how it turned out, because we'll be getting it soon enough.

49:07.460 --> 49:14.560
Also on the 3DS over there, Animal Resort, Dobutsen o Suikuro comes out, and Tom Clancy's

49:14.560 --> 49:17.120
Ghost Recon Shadow Wars also comes out.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.480
Trying to look at this Animal Resort, and honestly, when I see the box, the first thing

49:20.480 --> 49:24.580
I think of, honest, Africa.

49:24.580 --> 49:26.120
Because it looks just like that game.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.240
Who's putting out Animal Resort?

49:28.240 --> 49:33.280
Animal Resort is being put out by, who is this, AQ Interactive is putting out the game,

49:33.280 --> 49:37.920
but look at this, there's elephants you can take pictures of, and hippopotamus, it looks

49:37.920 --> 49:41.200
like you feed them, because there's little items there on the bottom, and it looks like

49:41.200 --> 49:46.520
this guy is dragging a type of fruit to feed the hippopotamus, but this is adorable, there's

49:46.520 --> 49:49.680
apparently penguins in this, so now I kind of want it, to be honest.

49:49.680 --> 49:54.680
Looks pretty good, I mean, for a 3DS title, the graphics are pretty good.

49:54.680 --> 50:01.200
It's kind of an interesting twist on Nintendogs, I bet what this is, is it's kind of like Nintendzoo.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.400
Maybe it's like Animonsnap.

50:03.400 --> 50:08.600
Well I was just wondering if, the only reason I asked who made it, is because there's a

50:08.600 --> 50:13.840
title coming from Ubisoft called Zoo Mania that looks similar to that, and I'm wondering

50:13.840 --> 50:16.320
if it's actually the exact same game.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.160
Perhaps, we'll have to look that up.

50:18.160 --> 50:22.900
On the Sony PSP this week on May the 19th, Akiba's Trip comes out.

50:22.900 --> 50:27.560
This is, uh, oh what do they do, it's a trip.

50:27.560 --> 50:30.040
It's a game where you get people to strip.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.840
No you don't get people to strip, I don't, what?

50:32.840 --> 50:38.340
Yes, you, by fighting them, they will remove, their clothes will be removed.

50:38.340 --> 50:39.840
I'm serious, there's an article about it.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.880
Oh my god, that is what's really happening in this picture, it looks like she's wearing

50:42.880 --> 50:44.440
cat ears and no pants.

50:44.440 --> 50:49.200
Now, not completely naked because, you know, it's a PSP title, but yes, that's exactly

50:49.200 --> 50:50.200
what happens.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.280
They do have porn titles for PSP.

50:52.280 --> 50:56.440
Yeah, but those are video titles, they're not actual game titles.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.440
Well.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.960
No, there's games.

50:59.960 --> 51:02.680
They do not have fully-nude games on the PSP.

51:02.680 --> 51:05.600
Trust me, I've looked.

51:05.600 --> 51:06.840
The wife really wants one.

51:06.840 --> 51:10.000
Well no, they sell them on J-list.

51:10.000 --> 51:16.920
They're x-rated UMDs, that's what those are, but they don't have actual PSP games.

51:16.920 --> 51:21.120
I mean, come on, this is Japan we're talking about, they're very conservative when it comes

51:21.120 --> 51:23.480
to video games.

51:23.480 --> 51:24.480
Uh-huh.

51:24.480 --> 51:29.000
Alright, and then there's a few games that move into best hits on the PSP as well, including

51:29.000 --> 51:33.560
FIFA Soccer 11 and Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos, but that does it for your Japanese releases.

51:33.560 --> 51:36.560
Let's go to the UK.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.560
In the UK.

51:37.560 --> 51:40.000
Actually, as soon as I voice somebody in our chat room.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.600
Okay, in the UK we have on the 17th Fallout New Vegas, Honest Hearts, and The Witcher

51:45.600 --> 51:52.440
2, Assassins of Kings for PC, and a new beginning on the 20th, Dead or Alive Dimensions and

51:52.440 --> 51:55.240
L.A. Noire.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.240
And that's it.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
Alright.

51:57.240 --> 52:00.700
Couple news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.080
What will it be this week?

52:02.080 --> 52:03.860
We'll find out in two more stories.

52:03.860 --> 52:07.800
So Microsoft had some money to spend and, you know, what did they decide to do?

52:07.800 --> 52:09.120
They bought Skype.

52:09.120 --> 52:16.640
So they bought Skype for $8.5 billion, and apparently they're gonna be, um, you know,

52:16.640 --> 52:21.920
Skype will be supported on Microsoft devices like the Xbox and Kinect, Windows Phone, and

52:21.920 --> 52:26.800
an array of other Windows devices, and also, of course, they announced that, um, you know,

52:26.800 --> 52:32.320
they'll still be supporting, you know, the platforms that it's on already, so, um, you

52:32.320 --> 52:34.880
know, the PSP and whatnot.

52:34.880 --> 52:39.880
And I guess this is also Skype users with Link, Outlook, and Xbox Live and other communities

52:39.880 --> 52:48.400
will be able to connect with Skype as well, so that's kind of neat.

52:48.400 --> 52:54.080
So I'm wondering now if we're gonna see, like, Windows with Skype, you know, built in as,

52:54.080 --> 52:58.680
you know, like a default program and stuff like that, or, you know, why this thing is

52:58.680 --> 53:00.480
kind of neat that they're gonna have Skype.

53:00.480 --> 53:05.000
I wonder if they're gonna do, like, the Avatar Kinect with Skype.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Maybe.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.920
Certainly this is gonna be coming to the 360 sooner rather than later.

53:07.920 --> 53:12.000
I'm kind of surprised this isn't being rushed for the spring update, uh, because that's

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
a pretty big addition.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.680
Like, I understand that, I guess right now, the Kinect video chat will work with Windows

53:16.680 --> 53:24.680
Messenger, but I don't know anyone that uses Windows Messenger that's not also on an Xbox,

53:24.680 --> 53:26.060
so I don't know.

53:26.060 --> 53:29.840
But you know the interesting thing about this is we've been using Skype here at Orange

53:29.840 --> 53:33.480
Lounge Radio since before podcasting.

53:33.480 --> 53:39.240
I think we took our first Skype call probably in 03, however old Skype is, we were on that

53:39.240 --> 53:40.240
really early.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.680
So it's gonna be very, you know, we're pretty loyal to the program.

53:42.680 --> 53:47.080
I mean, until it, I don't know, steals our credit card information or something, we're

53:47.080 --> 53:48.160
not gonna go anywhere.

53:48.160 --> 53:50.000
Until it out parties Caz.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Exactly.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.320
I'm gonna be, it's gonna be very interesting because pretty soon we're gonna be able to

53:54.320 --> 53:58.880
invite phone calls from people on their Kinects to chat with the show.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.060
That's gonna be something.

54:00.060 --> 54:03.840
That is pretty something, except the only problem is you still can't stream the show

54:03.840 --> 54:07.120
onto the 360.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.120
Not yet.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.360
I wish there was something they would do about that.

54:09.360 --> 54:16.040
Not unless, you know, you have, I don't, no, you can't do it through Pandora or last, was

54:16.040 --> 54:18.120
it last FM that's on there or Pandora?

54:18.120 --> 54:19.240
I can't remember.

54:19.240 --> 54:20.440
Last FM's on there.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.440
Last FM.

54:21.440 --> 54:22.440
I don't think you can get it through there.

54:22.440 --> 54:26.800
I mean, you could hook it up to a PC, but what's the point?

54:26.800 --> 54:31.080
I mean, you know, if it's hooked up to a PC already, then you might as well just use the

54:31.080 --> 54:32.080
PC.

54:32.080 --> 54:35.880
Misty, who is one of our archive experts in our chat room says she knows we were taking

54:35.880 --> 54:40.520
them at least by episode 111, uh, which would have been 04.

54:40.520 --> 54:46.680
I'm pretty sure we were taking them before that, but yeah, so it was a while ago.

54:46.680 --> 54:52.040
Anyhow, um, be very curious to see what this kind of all pans out to.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.440
Do you think, a lot of people are saying they paid too much for Skype.

54:54.440 --> 54:55.440
What do you think?

54:55.440 --> 54:59.360
I don't know how much Skype is worth.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.640
It's worth nothing to me.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.320
I'm not paying for it.

55:02.320 --> 55:08.840
Uh, yeah, I mean, Skype doesn't really do ads and they're free, you know, it's, it's,

55:08.840 --> 55:12.320
they're going to have to add ads to it at some point I think, and I don't know how people

55:12.320 --> 55:13.320
are going to feel about that.

55:13.320 --> 55:17.160
Well, they have to have some, I mean, they're, they have, you know, the Skype out services

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
and stuff like that.

55:18.160 --> 55:24.580
That's kind of neat, you know, um, and you know, if they're pushing the whole family

55:24.580 --> 55:25.580
angle and stuff.

55:25.580 --> 55:32.480
Hey, now you can call your friends on their phones and stuff like that or, I don't know.

55:32.480 --> 55:37.040
Alright well, the Level Up event was held by Namco Bandai this week and we want to go

55:37.040 --> 55:40.760
over some news from that event including, and this makes me very excited, a new Soul

55:40.760 --> 55:43.840
Calibur game was announced and I love the Soul Calibur series.

55:43.840 --> 55:47.560
So yeah, Soul Calibur 5 was announced this week, uh, that's pretty cool, that's going

55:47.560 --> 55:48.560
to be happening.

55:48.560 --> 55:52.700
Um, there was a little teaser trailer that was released, let me see if I can play a little

55:52.700 --> 55:56.120
bit of it here in the studio.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.120
Not a whole lot of characters showed up in there, but I think, like, nightmares in there

55:59.120 --> 56:04.840
and apparently there's a new character named Patroclus who's supposed to be the son of

56:04.840 --> 56:08.680
Sophitia and Rothian, so it could be interesting.

56:08.680 --> 56:12.520
The game is going to be out in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.

56:12.520 --> 56:17.280
It is set 17 years after the events of Soul Calibur 4.

56:17.280 --> 56:20.600
So yeah, I guess there's going to be quite a bit of roster revision going on there.

56:20.600 --> 56:24.840
Siegfried is also supposed to be in the game, uh, so, could be interesting.

56:24.840 --> 56:29.560
Uh, trailer won't load for me right now, YouTube's being kind of dumpy, being very slow.

56:29.560 --> 56:32.600
Has anyone else noticed that over the past few days, that it's just been running kind

56:32.600 --> 56:33.600
of like crap?

56:33.600 --> 56:34.600
Uncertain files, yeah.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.600
Yeah.

56:35.600 --> 56:48.880
So this is one of those certain files for sure.

56:48.880 --> 56:52.600
So this trailer is more like the opening cutscene that you would see in the game, probably.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.080
It doesn't really show a lot of gameplay.

56:54.080 --> 56:58.200
It's your very typical announcement trailer, but, uh, I'm looking forward to it.

56:58.200 --> 56:59.200
It's going to be awesome.

56:59.200 --> 57:01.120
I hope you still get to, like, make your own character and all that stuff.

57:01.120 --> 57:04.480
Yeah, I actually didn't play any of the make your own character ones.

57:04.480 --> 57:07.760
Very interesting tweet that actually came out in response to this.

57:07.760 --> 57:11.880
The game director Daishi Odoshima actually tweeted this.

57:11.880 --> 57:17.560
I asked the company if we can call the game Soul Edge 2, but they said no.

57:17.560 --> 57:21.760
So that might give you an idea about where this is going also, because remember the first

57:21.760 --> 57:26.640
Soul Calibur game, if you will, was really Soul Edge.

57:26.640 --> 57:31.240
Also news coming out of the event, Tekken Cross Street Fighter hasn't even started yet.

57:31.240 --> 57:32.920
Keep in mind there's two games being made.

57:32.920 --> 57:35.920
There's Street Fighter Cross Tekken and Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.560
Apparently Namco Bandai said they haven't even really started work on Tekken Cross Street

57:39.560 --> 57:40.560
Fighter yet.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.600
So yeah, interesting.

57:42.600 --> 57:47.480
The quote from producer Katushiro Harada said, quote, we really haven't started on Tekken

57:47.480 --> 57:48.760
Cross Street Fighter.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.920
Things are going well with Street Fighter Cross Tekken and we'll have more on that at

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
E3.

57:52.920 --> 57:54.320
We hope you look forward to that.

57:54.320 --> 57:56.440
So I don't know, maybe they're spacing the games out a little bit.

57:56.440 --> 57:57.440
Kind of interesting.

57:57.440 --> 58:01.160
By the way, speaking of Street Fighter Cross Tekken, a new teaser came out for it this

58:01.160 --> 58:04.640
week and it shows Kami.

58:04.640 --> 58:08.240
So Kami will be in the game, which really doesn't surprise anyone, I'm sure.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.440
Some other little bits and pieces that came out of that as well.

58:11.440 --> 58:16.860
Ace Combat Assault Horizons coming out October 11th in the US and the 14th in Europe.

58:16.860 --> 58:21.920
There's a new CG feature film based on Tekken called Tekken Blood Vengeance.

58:21.920 --> 58:27.440
Tales of Graces and Tales of Abyss also coming out on the PS3 and the 3DS respectively.

58:27.440 --> 58:32.360
And wait for it, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact coming out on the PSP because

58:32.360 --> 58:36.120
your life just wasn't complete without another Naruto game.

58:36.120 --> 58:39.400
I also know your lives just aren't complete unless we do the segment here on the show

58:39.400 --> 58:44.860
called the Classic Game of the Week.

58:44.860 --> 58:49.080
Every week we take a trip down memory lane where Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault

58:49.080 --> 58:53.880
and finds a game that she thinks you kids need to be playing.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.440
This is one some of you might remember.

58:55.440 --> 58:56.960
This isn't too old.

58:56.960 --> 58:57.960
No.

58:57.960 --> 59:01.680
And funny enough, totally ironically, I had no idea Dark Sakura was going to pick this

59:01.680 --> 59:02.680
game.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.200
I was playing this last night.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.200
Crazy.

59:05.200 --> 59:08.080
Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

59:08.080 --> 59:09.080
Umjama-lami.

59:09.080 --> 59:10.080
Umjama-lami.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.080
Okay.

59:11.080 --> 59:14.340
And I put in the one I thought was your favorite.

59:14.340 --> 59:18.200
This is my favorite song in the soundtrack.

59:18.200 --> 59:27.600
Anyway, Umjama-lami, yeah, and I did cover Parappa series, but I'm doing Umjama-lami

59:27.600 --> 59:28.600
anyway.

59:28.600 --> 59:29.600
I don't care.

59:29.600 --> 59:35.520
Umjama-lami was put out by Nana On'Sha and Namco in the arcade, well Namco in the arcade.

59:35.520 --> 59:37.080
Sorry the music died behind you.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.920
It's just YouTube's failing us tonight.

59:38.920 --> 59:39.920
Sorry guys.

59:39.920 --> 59:40.920
It's being uber fail.

59:40.920 --> 59:47.200
Um, at any rate, it came out in Japan on March 18th, 1999 and in North America on August

59:47.200 --> 59:48.200
17th, 1999.

59:48.200 --> 59:50.760
And yeah, it plays like Parappa, pretty much.

59:50.760 --> 59:58.240
Um, Namco released the arcade version and it had a guitar controller so that, um, you

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240
could get the sensation of playing a guitar.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.400
I mean, it's very similar to Guitar Freaks.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.560
We've seen one of these machines, remember?

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560
I do.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560
I do remember the machine.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.560
I had to like get on my knees to play it.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.840
Get your minds out of the gutter, people.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.800
It was made for kids and I'm a little tall.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.680
Anyway, it's like a Simon Says sort of thing, so, you know, they, their characters will

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.920
do something and then you do something and you have to basically repeat whatever it tells

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.680
you to do.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.920
And so through the game, you have a Chop Chop Master Onion from Parappa and that's where

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.480
you get Dojo Casino.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.480
It's all in the mind.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.000
And she goes, yeah, my guitar is in my mind.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.520
And then, um, but the whole thing is basically Lammy trying to get to her concert with her

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.120
group Milk Can at the Chop Chop Master Arena.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.560
And so she has to put out a fire and babysit babies with Kathy Pillar, which is a song,

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.760
and then fly an airplane and then chop down a tree to make a new guitar.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:07.800
And then she actually, um, well, gets sent to an island, but in the Japanese version,

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.360
she's actually, she actually dies and goes to hell.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.440
And I found a movie file of that to play for everybody.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.840
Oh, that's my cue, isn't it?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840
Sorry.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840
Yes, it is, Rob.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840
Here we go.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.400
And this is where Rob stops texting on his iPhone.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400
Hold on.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400
Let me bring this up.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:38.640
Here, you can have this too.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640
Distortion.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.640
Thank you.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:47.640
Two more minutes and I'm history.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.880
She's running in front of traffic.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880
These interludes were so bad.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.800
So it's not the banana peel that PJ Berry is eating the bananas.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.800
Cracks her head and dies.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.960
Stupid PJ Berry.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960
Stupid fat bear.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.960
Phew.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.960
It was a dream.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
Am I dead?

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
No, bitch.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960
You're 2D.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.960
Is this hell?

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:30.200
That's what I think every time I show up to this show, too.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.320
What a stupid game.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.320
And then the credits roll.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.320
This is great.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:58.400
And then she goes on stage with, uh, Teriyaki Yoko.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.440
Yeah, and that whole thing was cut out of the U.S. version.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:08.240
Yeah, they had her showing up on a desert island.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.200
And so it went into the whole Vital Idol song.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:21.480
And where she gets faxed back to life instead of teleported via fax from the island.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480
So yeah.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.760
Um, now I will tell you something, because I'll tell you why I picked this, is that Dan

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.020
and I discussed this today.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:35.520
And I was saying how I had a demo disc of this, and it had all of the stuff in the game

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.380
just locked out.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:43.120
And it had the original, you know, because in Time Trap Master Onion's song it said,

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.320
you could play in hell and go far.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.600
And it's on the demo disc, not on, anyway, but all this was left in in Europe and Japan.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.760
But in the U.S. people had to get a stick up their butt and have her go to an island.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:02.120
So anyway, um, you have four different ranks, you have good, you have bad, and you have

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.200
awful, and if you get a little awful, then your song ends.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.320
And the quality of the music changes also with each, each one too.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.680
But now you can also get cool, and so you basically freestyle unless you, uh, really

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.680
screw up.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.800
But if you keep cool by the end of the song, you'll get a cool ending to the level.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.840
And, but if it flashes good, then you go back into normal play.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.240
Like, uh, for this one, you know, if you get cool, then Terry Akioka goes, okay, you can

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.840
go by yourself, and then you're in this tunnel.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.760
But if, uh, you, you drop back down to good, he goes, okay, well you need me after all.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.600
But you also get different, um, uh, morphers to your sound.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.840
You get a flanger, you get a harmonizer, you get the wah-wah, you get distortion and a

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840
reverb.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.600
And then there are actually some different, uh, items that you get, like, in order, it's

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.680
a fire siren, a caterpillar rattle, um, Captain Fuss and Pepper's false teeth, who was the,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.680
uh, head-banging pilot in, uh, I think stage four.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.680
Uh, you get-

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680
Oh god, I love that stage.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680
Can I play that music?

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.680
Sure.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680
That music was awesome.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.600
You know, I could never beat that unless I did it cool.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
Really?

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600
That level?

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600
Uh-huh.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.600
But I could always get it to go cool.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:36.760
That's a trap level.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.720
This person's going for cool, too, so, anyhow.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.720
Yeah.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:50.720
Um, and so you also got, um, like, a, uh, a thievertime, so that if, you know, when

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:56.360
you enter a level after it's been completed, it brings up a chocolate screen with symbols,

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:02.040
and if you input everything in the right order, when the level is cool, the screen goes really

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.680
crazy, and symbols fly all over the place, and then you can hit those buttons repeatedly

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.320
and get uber points.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:15.840
So yeah, the, um, the arcade version was called Um Jammer Lamy Now, and it had a guitar controller,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.560
and it had, um, the buttons for triangle, circle, x, and square are strummers in the

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.720
middle of the guitar, and the L button is a slider at the top of the guitar, and there's

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.240
a scratch disk at the bottom, um, that's, instead of the R button, and, but it's really

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:38.080
the same as the, uh, home version, and there, uh, is, uh, an ability to play with Parappa

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.080
in that, too.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.120
So you've got Lamy mode, and then you have your co-op, which is Lamy and Ramy, who is

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:51.760
the dark version of Lamy, then you have versus, which is Lamy versus Ramy, you have solo Parappa,

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.240
you have Lamy and Parappa, and then you have, um, versus Lamy and Parappa, and then you

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240
have a special mode.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:05.800
So, um, it's, uh, basically you can just listen to any of the songs in good, bad, awful, or

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:11.560
cool mode, and, of course, you could also do that if you had the PSX play a little program

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.840
and could rip all your files, but, uh, I digress.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.880
So, um, you also had, uh, yeah, like I said, there were the, the changes.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:27.120
Now, I, I brought up the hell changes, um, but for, uh, Paul Chuck in stage five, instead

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.600
of chopping trees down for the fun, it was changed knowing that we're here for the fun,

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:40.920
and then, of course, Terry Akioko, like I said, and, uh, Lamy is actually wearing a

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:49.160
camouflage t-shirt and, uh, has jungle makeup to show that she's in the jungle, ooh, and

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:56.600
then, um, also, uh, this, the scene before stage seven has Catty Cat and Masan riding

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:03.520
a camel, and, uh, the ending credits is, uh, an instrumental version of Keep Your Head

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.080
Up, and then Chop Chop Master Onion's music was, of course, changed.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.880
The demo, like I said, has everything in it, and then there was, uh, there was three soundtracks

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:18.920
came out, one called Make It Sweet, which is all the music done by Milk Can, and, uh,

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:24.120
there was called Ice Cream, which was remixed versions of the songs, and then, um, and that

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.600
was with, uh, Dread Fox's Parappa, and then the whole original soundtrack, which I've

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.600
got somewhere.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:38.080
So yeah, the game is super awesome, it's super fun, and, uh, it's, uh, really great, but

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.720
I still think it's stupid that they had to change it.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.920
In fact, uh, Game Vortex, uh, criticized it, and I think this is the best way of saying

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.760
something that said it was an unfortunate thing, and said, did I miss some logical leap?

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.640
I think our kids can handle such a basic concept as hell.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640
The end.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.080
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Umm Jamma Lemmy.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.360
You know, and I was none the wiser when I first played this game, because, you know,

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.960
I wasn't really following the import gaming scene, you know.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.820
See, I had bought a certain game, actually, it was at Anime Expo, and I talked my way

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:13.360
into a demo disc, because I was so excited about this game.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.360
Nice.

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.360
Alright.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.280
Well, there it is, your classic game of the week, uh, anyhow, we, uh, are gonna take a

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.920
quick break here live, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.840
We got plenty more to come in Part B tonight, including some other new game announcements.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.360
Uh, in rapid fire news tonight, uh, a big arcade collection's been announced, also,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.640
uh, a big popular beta has been announced for later this year, it's gonna be huge.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:41.400
Uh, also we're gonna get into some more lawsuits in Part B, some Portal 2 news, and, uh, yeah,

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:46.760
some more, uh, localization, or maybe not, just, uh, unlocalized games that you can still

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760
buy locally.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.360
That'll make sense in a little bit.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.960
Anyhow, we're gonna take a break, but stay tuned, guys, we'll be back with more of Orange

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:01.240
Lounge Radio.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.720
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:09.600
We are live with our 413th episode on this Sunday, May the 15th of 2011, and of course,

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.620
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.440
Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.640
So we're just coming out on a music break, and some discussions there in Part A about,

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.600
uh, PlayStation Network, of course, coming back online, although, I don't know, it's

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.280
still a little spotty for some people.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.920
Monster World 4 getting a localization finally, and of course the big story this week about

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.680
Microsoft buying Skype.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.600
Uh, I noticed in studio here that Loki is playing Portal 2.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.800
It looks very nice on your laptop, I gotta say, the graphics for that are, uh, pretty

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800
smooth.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.240
You must have a pretty powerful little laptop there, I didn't realize.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.240
Yes, I do.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240
Nice.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240
So, are you enjoying the game so far?

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240
Yeah.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.640
I'm not too far into it, from what I can tell, so, awesome.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.680
Even though you had the ending ruined for you already, but that's alright.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.200
I haven't had it ruined a long time ago.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.360
You kinda like the spoiler stuff anyway, so, usually.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.680
Yeah, I don't care.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.520
Alright, uh, we don't just do Orange Lounge Radio, all of us hosts here, we do have some

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.020
side projects, we usually like to take this opportunity to plug those projects.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.560
If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, you might enjoy these other great shows.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560
Dark Sakura?

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:16.960
I do Comic Insanity with, uh, Tiara, also known as Mara & Marvel, and Dan Shadow, and

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.480
we have a new one coming up on Tuesday with our new format, where we introduce a few new

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.760
segments and, uh, condense a couple other segments, so it's new stuff.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:33.560
But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S, and you can also find us on Twitter at Comic

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.200
Insanity, with no I.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200
Alright.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.600
Well, uh, my podcast that I do with my buddy, Extafur, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth,

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.080
about all things World of Warcraft, we're not having a format switch this week, but

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.520
I believe we're having Dark Sakura on as our guest this week, so that'll be exciting.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Hopefully.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
Yep.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:56.400
So, uh, yeah, you can check that out, www.hordehouse.com for more information about our little program

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.040
there, uh, where we talk about the World of Warcraft, but never too seriously, because

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.520
I'll tell you what, I've been kind of a jaded Warcraft player lately, so I have not been

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.880
the most happy-go-lucky about the game.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.800
And I know everybody's like, well then quit, asshole!

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:15.200
But uh, I've got too many friends that play, and how would I slay internet dragons without

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.200
my wow?

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.280
Anyhow, uh, more talk about World of Warcraft on that show.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.280
Fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap,

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.280
fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280
I do not fap to Warcraft.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.880
Although, apparently, I don't wanna give too much away, but apparently Extafur's been playing

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:32.040
on a server notorious for the fap chat, and uh, he's gonna give us a report on that this

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.880
week, so that should be exciting.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.520
As a role-player, you're gonna really look forward to that, huh, Dar Sakura?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.520
Oh, baby.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.640
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick stuff.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.040
There was a lot of little stories this week that unfortunately the PlayStation Network

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.880
was kind of dominating over, but let's get to it.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880
Loki, some quick stuff.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.500
And oh, by the way, your Twitter topic's coming up after this.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.480
If you haven't gotten your tweets in, you got like two minutes to do it, twitter.com

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480
slash o-l-r.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.600
Including one item that actually will be played on the PlayStation Network, Starhawk.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.520
It is the new, I guess, more futuristic sequel to Warhawk.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.240
That'll be coming soon, hopefully.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.920
I'm sure it's gonna be something they show off at E3, and been teased for a while.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.640
I even think there's some assets or something that leaked out about it.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.400
But apparently, oh, next year is when it's due out.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.880
It'll be the same kind of format as Warhawk was.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.800
They even promised space battles at some point.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:34.520
Not sure how that's gonna really work, but also a single player story mode, and a build

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.320
and battle system will be coming to it as well.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.520
So, if you like that game, you may wanna check it out.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:46.320
I know that the original game's really cheap right now, so if you wanna check that out,

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.600
it might be worth it.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:59.520
And then, of course, yes, the developers of Splosion Man comes Splosion, Ms. Splosion Man.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:11.280
And of course, not to pass up capitalizing on what might be an internet sensation, 2G1C.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.060
Some people may think Two Girls, One Cup, but no, Two Girls, One Controller.

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.160
So in this game mode, you'll- I try not to think about Two Girls, One Cup ever.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.160
Yeah.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.500
Thanks, Loki.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.400
Two Girls, One Controller, it's a different mode that's gonna be in the game.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:31.980
You're actually gonna control each one of the Ms. Splosion Men with one analog stick

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:37.240
on the controller, and you would detonate them with the trigger buttons, I believe.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.740
So that's interesting.

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:46.260
I don't know how that'll play, but it's something that they're throwing in that you can try

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.680
out.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:54.160
And then finally, as I was mentioning earlier, of course, the new update coming out for the

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160
Xbox 360.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:01.040
It's gonna reflash those people that had modified firmwares on their DVD drives.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:09.160
Well, to combat that, of course, people out there have tools to get around things, and

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:16.360
one hacker or tool maker, I guess, Electron, has released E-Tool version 0.2.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.280
It is a new tool for extracting and injecting the key from the light-on fat drives that

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.680
were flashed with the new firmware by the Beta Dash.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:32.680
So because those firmwares, once they get flashed, it's unable to be read by popular

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.460
programs like the Jungle Flasher and stuff like that.

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.360
So now this program will actually read the keys from that, and it will also reflash the

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.360
drives for you.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.940
So I have a feeling that this new format that they're gonna be putting out there will get

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.680
bypassed very quickly.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.760
In fact, I have a feeling it will be bypassed within a month.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:59.360
That's probably being very generous.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.800
And then, yeah, that's it.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800
All right.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.560
So do you think that hack poses a pretty serious threat to all the researchers?

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
Well, it's one of many.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:15.480
I mean, Commodore Forever, they're working on a new firmware for all drives, actually,

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.940
and I believe that already is almost done.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:24.780
They're just doing some further testing with the new XG, what is it, the XG-D3 format.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:30.120
So I'm assuming, though, that that's probably gonna be bypassed.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:35.120
Then there's also the X360 key, which is supposed to be coming out at some point.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.880
That's gonna emulate the drive altogether, and that, I think, is the worst threat they

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:47.760
could possibly have, because right there, that's playing game ISOs off of a hard drive

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.300
without needing to really modify your system.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300
It's plug-and-play.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.600
You just plug it in between your drive and the system.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.960
All right.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.560
Well, let's move on to some other games coming out this year that, oh my gosh, this one is

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.920
highly anticipated, and I say this year as I hope it comes out this year, although they

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.880
haven't really said.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.680
Diablo 3, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this, apparently, the internal

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.440
company-wide testing has begun, the internal testing process for Diablo 3.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.120
According to Mike Morheim, who's the Blizzard CEO, or I guess he's the guy in charge over

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.960
there, he's saying the game looks great.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.560
We are currently targeting a quarter-three launch for external beta testing.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560
Awesome.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.120
They are working to get the game out before 2012, but no promises as of yet.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.760
Also, in regards to Diablo 3, apparently there was a promotional video that showed up on

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.840
the internet.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.080
It did finally go official, but it wasn't supposed, I think this was leaked early from

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.280
the Korean side of Blizzard Entertainment.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.080
There's a new follower system in Diablo 3.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.840
You actually hire characters to help you out in the game.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.920
This kind of sounds inspired by Torchlight, actually, because you can kind of have the

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.040
pet in one of the classes, you can get all these little demon followers, pretty cool.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:08.240
But these followers will actually be in different classes, Enchantress, Scoundrel, Templars.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.760
You're gonna be able to give these guys weapons, rings, and you'll even be able to give them

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760
their own skills.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.320
Yeah, this really sounds like the pets from Torchlight, but maybe a little more fleshed

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.320
out.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.320
So that's pretty exciting.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.120
Dark Souls, this game is gonna be hard as hell.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.560
It's gonna come out October 11th, of course, this is the unofficial, well, I shouldn't

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:31.040
say unofficial, but the, don't call it a sequel, but it is to Demon's Souls, which was one

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.240
of those hard as hell games on the PlayStation 3.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.320
One of the best, hands down, PlayStation 3 exclusive games.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.440
Dark Souls is gonna be coming out on October 11th.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.880
Even though there's been the PlayStation Network outages and so forth, that's not gonna stop

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880
them.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.720
But Kai Hirono, who's the producer of the game, spoke with CVG saying that the outage

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.160
caused, quote, some problems for the development, but that the team is, quote, in contact with

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.680
Sony and is aiming to meet a street date of October 11th.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.640
Well, it's nice that Sony's talking to some of their people.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:07.320
And also, finally, from me tonight, oh God, it's taken only 413 episodes of Orange Lounge

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.000
Radio, but finally, I get to report on a story about Lady Gaga.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yay!

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.040
And yes, it reports, I'm sorry, it relates to gaming.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:25.080
That's right, Lady Gaga is coming to, I can't believe I'm gonna say this either, Farmville.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.600
Oh, I saw the ads for that.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:34.040
Yeah, Lady Gaga and Zynga a while ago had this whole donation for Japanese disaster

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:41.240
relief going on, and I guess that partnership has grown into the May 17th opening of Gagaville.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:46.120
It is going to be a neighbor to Farmville.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:52.000
It's gonna feature unicorns, crystals, and your chance to listen to new tracks from the

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.680
album Born This Way.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:59.840
Apparently, you're gonna get, like, download vouchers for the album with $25 gift cards,

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.540
a word with friends contest to get exclusive DACA merchandise, and so forth.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.540
Kind of interesting.

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:11.320
At first, I kind of looked at this and I was like, oh God, really, this is so gross.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.780
I'm gonna have to go and play Farmville again if I want to hear new Gaga songs.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.520
Like fuck you, Lady Gaga, I don't want to do this.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:23.080
But then I kind of thought about it and I'm like, actually, considering that Gaga's fan

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:32.920
base is a lot of, let's face it, losers, fuck you, middle aged to teenage girls, and who's

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.760
playing mostly Farmville?

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.360
Middle aged to teenage girls.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.240
So whereas I'm not super excited about this, like, they're targeting the right audience.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.080
So it is really smart marketing.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:48.120
Of course, just as a person who's not a big fan of Zynga products, I'm not that excited,

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.980
but I get it.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.120
She was on American Idol the other day and I just, I don't get it.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:00.200
I really don't understand the appeal of her and I have no appeal of her as a person, her

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.520
as an artist, her music.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.800
It's just, it's seriously lost on me.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.400
I think her music's very catchy.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400
That's what it's all about.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.640
And I think she's a very genuine person from her interviews and so forth.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640
She's genuine.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.640
Yeah, I understand.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:20.340
I mean, yes, there's a lot of marketing machine behind it, yes, but I, she's a living, breathing

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.360
piece of art.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.020
That's how I see her, but that's okay if you don't get it.

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.520
Art is meant to be interpreted in many different ways.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.520
Yeah.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520
Okay.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.320
I'm sorry.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.240
Being as strange as possible is not art.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.900
How fucking cra- What's your excuse?

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.720
How fucking crazy can I be?

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:45.600
Well, hey, I'm not fucking calling what I do art, but seriously, if anyone calls it-

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.880
I just keep thinking of Eddie Izzard now.

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.640
It was like, I'm going to put poop on my head and sell myself to an art gallery.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:59.120
Yes, I'm waiting for the full fecal suit from, you know, Lady Gaga, because it's, it's,

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.120
it's on its way.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.320
That's the path that she is traveling.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.440
Maybe when she's in the retirement home, 50 years from now, she'll be wearing a poop suit.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440
Please.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:16.120
It's just gonna be, I don't know, she'll have, uh, she'll make, like, some sort of suit out

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:22.240
of some sort of dinosaur fossil, come out there, you know, calling like an eagle or

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.840
something like that, take a giant dump on stage, roll around in it, and set herself

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.040
on fire.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.040
Boom!

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040
Lady Gaga concert!

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.040
Next year!

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.040
Okay?

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.040
Alright, look, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but this is too much Lady Gaga chat

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.160
for our show, so let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.760
Do you, do you never saw the link I sent, the two links I sent you?

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.760
What's that?

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:47.760
Well, you know, I keep up with the, uh, gal fashion, and one of the companies that I like

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:53.000
their clothes is actually Lady Gaga's working with one of the men's styles to release a

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.400
bunch of t-shirts.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.920
I get all my news from the Fuck Yeah Lady Gaga Tumblr.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.920
Anyhow.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.880
And I sent you paper dolls.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.880
Let's move on.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880
More gaming news.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.720
Okay, well, how about Angry Birds?

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.360
It's on Chrome OS and the Chrome browser.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:15.240
You can actually, uh, play it, um, now, apparently.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:21.880
Um, it's free to play, has microtransactions, but the, uh, web-exclusive ones have Chrome

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.640
bombs, and exclusive Chrome levels, and the paper use Mighty Eagle.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.000
Yeah, don't care.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.520
What, Rob?

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.440
So I'm just reading our chatroom chat.orangelandraday.com.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.600
Tiger Claw says, doing OLR should be considered an art form.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.000
And Salacious Pop says, OMG Lady Gaga channeling GG Allen.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.320
He did all those, or maybe Alin, I don't know this artist, but he did all of those things

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.240
that Loki just, he did all those things that Loki just said, by the way, including the

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.520
fire in the poop.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.520
Yeah.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.840
So it's already been done, Loki, so I can't do it.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840
I'm sorry.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.840
How about gaming?

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.840
Yes.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840
Minecraft stuff.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:08.120
Uh, basically the creator, um, Marcus Pearson, is, uh, has a poll on his blog about Minecraft

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.720
Con, seeing if people would be interested in attending it in Las Vegas, so there is

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:20.520
a, uh, a no and a yes, and so far no is winning, so.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:24.960
I will be bringing a bunch of blocks to put in front of the door to trap everyone in Minecraft

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.280
Con.

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:31.440
I'm looking at this screen capture from, I'm guessing, from Minecraft, and it looks completely,

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.560
these people have too much damn time.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.840
So how about Mortal Kombat?

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.800
Yeah, I don't know, I think Minecraft Con's not a terrible idea, because hell, they have

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.760
cons for people that dress up like furry animals, so, you know, if the furries can have their

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.360
con, you know.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:54.580
Mortal Kombat Collection will be, the original trilogy will be going on the Xbox Live Arcade

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.880
and the Playstation Network, and, of course, Collection is spelled with a K, and it will

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.160
also be on PC for 800 Microsoft points.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.160
Does Lady Gaga have a convention?

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.760
Would it be called Gaga for GagaCon?

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.760
Perhaps.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.440
I know Cher has a convention, did I ever tell you about that story?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.520
I was in, uh, LA, I was in Woodland Hills specifically for work, doing some stuff down

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.440
there, and, uh, I was staying at a hotel, and I get in this elevator with literally

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.920
fifteen people all decked out in Cher shirts and concert, and I was kinda like, oh, is

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.920
Cher in town?

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.320
They're like, no, there's a Cher convention going on here at the hotel.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.000
And I'm like, oh.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Is she here?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.840
And they're like, no, she's in France.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.340
Like, oh.

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.480
But she sent a video or something like that.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.240
If I could turn back time.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.960
I literally walked into a Cher convention, and despite what you may think about homosexuals,

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.160
I'm not, like, screaming, ah, for Cher.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160
Like, she's cool.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160
I think she's pretty fierce.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.960
I wonder what's the show about Chaz.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.360
I don't, yeah, I don't really follow the Cher stuff, but my mother loves Cher.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.240
I got dragged to a Cher concert by my mother.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.520
Rob.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.080
I just love Cher.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.480
She's so funny.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.720
She's such a diva, Rob.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.160
I like your mom.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.400
I want your mom to adopt me.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.600
I can't believe she's younger than me, though.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.340
All right, anyhow, um, oh yeah, Mortal Kombat Collection, sounds great.

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:18.400
If we didn't already have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox Live Arcade and Mortal Kombat

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.920
2 on PlayStation Network.

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.240
But then they stopped selling 3 or something?

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240
They did.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.120
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was delisted some time ago.

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.640
Yeah, it was delisted after they decided, hey, we're gonna re-release it again.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640
Haha.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.280
All right.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.120
Anyhow, Rama in our chatroom says, Gaga convention?

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.060
It's called the West Village, Rob.

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.400
So noted.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.560
I would like to pick up that whole Mortal Kombat with the new arcade stick they're gonna

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:49.600
put out, though, because Mortal Kombat 2 especially was so awesome, especially with the real stick.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.120
Well, they were, whatever happened to, they were supposed to be putting out an HD collection

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.120
or something like that on the PlayStation 3, it's gonna be all the Mortal Kombat games,

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120
like, re-done.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120
I think that's this.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.160
But this isn't this, or this isn't that.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.480
It's basically just, hey, look, we're porting the shit straight over, we're not doing anything

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480
to it.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.480
Then they decide, hey, you know what?

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.760
They decide to put out some poop and set it on fire.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.520
It's too much work to actually do something, let's just re-release the old shit.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.520
Alright.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.520
Let's go to some Twitter.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.000
Let's do the Nintendo way.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.160
Let's go to the tweets, twitter.com slash olr, tweet, tweet, tweet.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.720
Every week you guys tweet us and we read your tweets, unless you're gonna tweet something

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.160
that we're gonna talk about on the show in about 30 minutes, anyway.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.400
I'mNotBenji sends us a tweet, well then who are you?

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.280
Sends us a tweet saying, can I pre-F you?

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.280
If so, F you to being at a place tonight where I can't listen to OLR.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.840
That is screwed up, F that.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:49.160
I would say though, just a tip, if you are a smartphone owner, especially like the iPhones,

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.520
I'm not sure how well this works on Android and the other stuff, because I'm an iPhone

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.960
owner, but allgames.com runs on HTML5, so you can actually get the feed by just going

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.720
to allgames.com on your iPhone or whatever, so just saying, just for future reference.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:05.920
BobbyBlackWolf tweeted us that he has now sent the best email ever.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.240
I'm looking forward to it.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:14.440
FunnyTman tweets us saying, this is a fun little Metroidvania type game I found.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.920
So I'm going to the link here, it's IndieGames.com, and the game is called Hydra Castle Labyrinth

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920
Buster.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.740
Oh, maybe that's the author, I don't know, but Hydra Castle Labyrinth.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:31.720
It's a freeware 2D platformer created by E. Hashimoto, who made Akuji the Demon and Guardian

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.800
of Paradise.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:40.200
It's similar to La Mulana, and the Castlevania series.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.580
The health gauge and sub weapon indicator are both displayed on the top left corner

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.200
of the screen.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:52.280
Hydra Castle Labyrinth you can download from Buster's site, hp.vector.code.jp.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.220
This sounds pretty cool, and it's only 1.25 megs.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:29:00.880
I will kindly link this in our chat room, so if you guys want to check that out, there

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.880
you go.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.640
Enjoy.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.960
It sounds like Dark Tetsuya has already played it, I'm so not surprised.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960
Alright.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.240
Sj100matt tweets us a couple things, one of them is coming up a little later in the show,

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.360
but the other one I want to mention is, with arcades being closed down, a new video game

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.060
themed lounge has opened up in Las Vegas, looks nice.

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:25.120
You know, I heard there's a new arcade in San Francisco as well, and I can't remember

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.180
for the life of me what the name is.

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.240
Maybe somebody in chat won't figure it out for me, but there's a new arcade in San Francisco

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.880
I think, I haven't been to yet.

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.440
And now apparently there's this place called Insert Coins in Las Vegas, it's a video lounge

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.440
game bar.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.080
Yeah, I remember seeing that.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.980
Huh, that sounds kind of neat.

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.800
It will, according to the website here that I'm on right now, Insert Coins will electrify

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:53.720
all your senses with its revolutionary amalgamation of classic arcades, ultra lounge service,

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.480
console video gaming, and the world's greatest video DJs, all under its 7,000 square foot

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:03.560
roof, nestled in the iconic neon-laden Fremont East District of Las Vegas.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.200
That actually sounds kind of awesome, I got to say.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:11.960
It sounds like it's video games meets booze meets loud music.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:12.960
Sounds awesome.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.440
Maybe this type of shit's ready to make a resurgence.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440
That's kind of what I'm hoping.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:19.960
Like, you know, I got to say, when I went to Portland, one of the most awesome places

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:24.600
I went to was the barcade that they had there, and I apologize, I forget the name of it,

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600
but it's-

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600
Ground control.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600
Thank you.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.600
Thank you.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.720
Dan's yelling at it from the other room.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720
Ground control.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.920
Yeah, that place was- isn't that place fucking rad, Dan?

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:36.120
Oh, God, Dan, you got to go.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:40.000
Oh my God, it's beer and 80s games.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.160
All right, Dan says road trip.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.920
We might just have to.

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:45.920
It's awesome.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:52.080
So, anyhow, you know, it's a bummer you're starting school that week, because before

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.120
we go to LA, we could go to Portland and go to ground control.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.880
You know, yeah, screw Dark Sakura.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.880
You and I'll go, Dan.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.480
Hey.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:10.000
Dan and I are going to go on a bro trip.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Dan's yelling from the kitchen.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
What's the first gayest thing you've ever done?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.520
It'll be the second gayest thing-

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.960
Oh, yeah.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.600
This is horrible radio, because they can't hear you.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.880
We need to have a boom mic in the kitchen just for Dan.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.560
Dan, get in here and do a report.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:29.200
Dan said the first gayest thing he did was play rock band at Matt's party.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.560
Let me move on to some more tweets.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:37.360
Spazinator PSN tweets us saying PlayStation Network is down again as of 9 p.m. Eastern,

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.720
6 p.m. Pacific.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.600
And I was like, well, wait a minute, Spazinator.

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:43.880
Maybe you just need to try it four times before you get in, like I had to do earlier.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.960
But I'm looking at the official PlayStation blog.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.360
Guess what?

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:52.640
We are currently experiencing an extremely heavy load of password resets.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:57.640
And so we recently had to turn off services for approximately 30 minutes to clear the

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.720
queue.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.380
As such, a large number of people are attempting to change their passwords at the same time.

01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:08.560
It's taking longer than expected for all those emails to clear all of the ISPs.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:14.600
So yep, not even 24 hours after it came back up, PlayStation Network had to go back down.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.600
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.240
What a whore.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.120
More tweets for, what, did you call it a whore?

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.120
Exactly.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.200
Had to go back down.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:33.800
Hey, Tiger Claw sends us a couple tweets.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.680
Oops, I guess I just reported on one of them.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.220
But I'll read this other one about the Sony Online Entertainment Senior Producer is now

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:43.680
the Zynga Austin GM.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.800
That's John Blakely.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:50.240
He did some projects including Star Wars Galaxies and DC Universe Onlines.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:53.360
Now he's leading Zynga in Austin.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.680
So he went from the dark side to the darker side.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.840
All from his LinkedIn profile.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.960
Let's see.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.840
Candied Critique sends us a tweet saying, someone makes Counter-Strike, Osama compound

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.840
map.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.840
Yay or nay?

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.800
I thought something like this we had discussed on the show this week.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:15.740
And this isn't all too surprising.

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:20.100
Give a bunch of gamers a blank palette and controversial things are sure to be made everywhere

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:25.840
from nude patches to overly violent things to real life scenarios that may or may not

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.880
be kind of tacky playing out.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:33.360
So yeah, we get linked to this article here about the Pakistani compound where Osama bin

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.800
Laden of course, I mean unless you've been living under a fucking rock, was found and

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:43.480
killed by US Navy Seals, is now a playable mod in, what is this, Counter-Strike.

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.700
Oh great.

01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.200
So I can go into Counter-Strike and play this game.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.480
Not only can I play real life news, but I can get called every name in the book while

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:55.000
doing it because Counter-Strike has a really rude online community, just so you know.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.520
Lastly, here's a question for the host.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.040
I like these tweets.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.640
They're questions for the host.

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.860
That's what this really should all be about, but here you go.

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:09.560
TheBaconBits tweets us, IDK if it's been asked before, but what is your guys' favorite game

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.800
soundtrack of all time?

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:17.640
Personally, mine is the SMG OST, I'm assuming that means Super Mario Galaxy OST.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:22.040
BaconBits asking, what is your favorite game soundtrack of all time?

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.560
Dark Sakura?

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:28.240
Uh, I...

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.240
I...

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.240
I...

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.240
I...

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.240
I...

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:33.240
I...

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.240
I...

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.240
I...

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.240
I...

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.240
I...

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.240
I...

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:39.240
I...

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.240
I...

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.240
I...

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.240
I...

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.960
Um, I don't know.

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:51.600
It would have to be kind of a tossup between, um, well I did like, I listened the crap out

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.440
of the Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix soundtrack when that was out because I actually bought

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:02.040
that at Anime Convention, which is pretty awesome, and then I'd say it's either between

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:11.160
4th, 5th, Max, 2, or DJ Hero 1, because DJ Hero 2 is kind of dumb.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.480
Um, as tempted as I am to throw in a Bamani soundtrack like DDR 3rd Mix, probably my favorite

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:22.600
soundtrack ever, or BeatMania 2DX Fist Style, honestly, I go to the Super Nintendo and there's

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:27.760
three games on the Super Nintendo that for me all kind of tie, maybe one slightly ahead

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:28.760
for first place.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.600
Actually, I'm going to add Super Metroid to that one.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:37.360
Super Metroid would be on my top three, absolutely, Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:42.400
it, would also be up there, but I think just the slight edge, I think probably the greatest

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.840
video game soundtrack ever made, Actraiser.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.160
I love the Actraiser soundtrack, it is beautiful, gorgeous music.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.000
You know what actually I'd have to add to my list would be Chrono Trigger.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.040
Oh, Chrono Trigger's got a pretty fucking sweet soundtrack.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.840
Linked to a pass is pretty awesome too.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:02.600
I'm gonna find my favorite piece of music in Chrono Trigger and send it to you to play.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.160
Alright you do that.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.040
But maybe next week during the break, we're out of music breaks tonight.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.040
Alright, that's going to do it for the tweets, twitter.com slash olr if you want to get in

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.160
early for next week.

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.680
In the meantime, more news, and oh boy, it's the lawsuit segment time.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680
Yay!

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.680
Yay!

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:25.160
This is retarded, but a former Navy- Now, Loki, don't use the R word.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.000
You can say butt-tarded.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.360
It's retarded.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.520
Say gay-tarded, because it's doubly offensive.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.520
No, it's retarded.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:40.320
Former Navy pilot John Ryan McLaughlin, he is suing Bethesda, because he says that Elder

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:46.320
Scrolls IV Oblivion gave him a grand mal seizure that cost him his flight status.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.040
It was his first seizure he had ever had, and it was violent enough to break a bone,

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:57.920
and I guess he's permanently barred from flying the F-18 planes, which he was trained on.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.920
And he's suing them because he says Oblivion was designed that it exceeds the upper acceptable

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:09.280
limit of more than three flashes over one second period, as well as an acceptable spatial

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.040
pattern and luminance flash limits.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:18.440
These risks were not made known to the plaintiff and or ordinary customer prior to the time

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.440
of purchase.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.700
Bullshit, they're in the manual.

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:27.160
Every fucking manual has a goddamn epilepsy warning in it.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.280
So I'm sorry, that is some serious bullshit right there.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:39.520
Anyways, he wants damages for negligence, breach of warranty, and product liability.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.520
He's gonna lose.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:48.800
But yeah, every goddamn manual, and fuck, every goddamn manual since games had manuals,

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.800
have had that warning in there.

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:54.120
I think like from the Nintendo, well I'm sure they've had manuals for games before that,

01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:01.240
but Nintendo I think was one of the first series of games or whatever that had manuals

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:06.800
that had that warning in there because I always thought it was ridiculous, but I mean people

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:13.720
have seizures because of flashing lights sometimes, but I'm sorry, just take some responsibility

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720
for yourself.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.800
Yeah, it sucks that you can't fly anymore, but you know what, if you had this problem

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.680
to begin with and this game set it off, then it's probably a good thing that you're not

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.600
flying a plane.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.880
I mean seriously, oh he didn't realize he had seizure problems or whatever and something

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.440
flashes and he crashes the damn plane into an orphanage.

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:39.720
I don't remember there being an amazing seizure mode in Oblivion either, you know it wasn't

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:45.480
like that Pokemon cartoon from years ago where it flashed the red and blue rapidly that kind

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.840
of caused all those kids to have seizures, I don't, like, you know Oblivion's been out

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:56.480
for a long time now too, you know, but I think seizures are an unfortunate side effect to

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.120
gaming in general for some people, you know, unfortunately some people have to really watch

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.240
the video games they play.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.200
For example, Dark Sakura has talked openly on the show about how she can't play first

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.360
person shooters very long, she gets motion sick, you know.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.880
I have thrown up, Portal 2 made me throw up.

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:17.320
You have to control yourself, you know, and unfortunately some people have limits and

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.640
you gotta, you know, control those limits.

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.640
You can't-

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.920
Turn the brightness down on your TV when you play Oblivion or something, you know.

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:28.400
You can't blame a game for a problem that clearly existed before that.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:35.880
If other, okay, you've got person A who has zero inclination towards epilepsy, and you've

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:40.920
got person B who doesn't know they have any inclination towards epilepsy, but they do.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.820
And you sit them both in front of the same product, well of course the one who has the

01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:50.040
inclination, whether they know about it or not, is going to react to it.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.320
It's like how I found out I was allergic to bell peppers.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.320
I didn't know.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.320
My mom eats them.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.120
I ate a bell pepper, my tongue swelled up, and I got sick.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.120
Yeah.

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.120
You know.

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.680
And besides that, they're nasty.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.680
BlackWolf in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com says, at least he got the seizure while playing

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.760
a video game rather than well flying.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.000
Yeah, so like I said, yeah, would you rather he be flying a plane and, you know, get a

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.880
seizure than crash into, I don't know, an orphanage, orphanage, a mall, and-

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:16.880
Would you rather be-

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.880
Children.

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.880
Children.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:19.880
For dead.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.800
Well, let's talk about another lawsuit and this one, oh boy.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.200
This is a lawsuit against Chuck E. Cheese.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:30.280
Is it for the fact that they got rid of all their good arcade games?

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.280
Because I wanted to join in on that one.

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.240
Actually sort of.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.920
It's a lawsuit against the ticket dispensing games at Chuck E. Cheese because it creates

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.600
gambling addiction in little children.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.300
A lawsuit has been filed in California.

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.400
They're looking for five million dollars.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.600
The person who filed the lawsuit, Denise Keller.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.880
She's a mom, two girls, five and three.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.980
Chuck E. Cheese's arcade games are akin to slot machines, says the complaint.

01:40:55.980 --> 01:41:01.000
By offering tickets as a payout that can be redeemed for prizes, the machines, quote,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.680
create the same highs and lows experienced by adults who gamble their paychecks or the

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.160
mortgage payment.

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.200
The lawyer says, it's not about the money, it's about the kids.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.200
Right.

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.600
California law forbids gambling.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.480
That's only like partially true because I can think of poker rooms out in Rancho Cordova,

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.000
which is an incorporated city.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.880
And I can think of Indian casinos not far up the free with Thunder Valley, not that

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.760
far up 80, Red Hawk, not that far up 50.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.520
And fuck, Reno is only like two hours away.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:37.620
I mean, if California bans gambling, I get it.

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.360
The Indian casinos are on Indian land.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360
I understand that.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.360
And the California lottery?

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.080
Yeah, the lottery.

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.420
So they don't ban gambling that well, you know what I mean?

01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:51.240
But anyhow, it does make an exception for payouts if the contest is predominantly a

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:57.520
game of skill, which as you know, these crane games and skeeball games and so forth, they

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:01.040
are of course mainly games of skill.

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.920
Well that's awesome that those, well I don't know if it's really awesome.

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:09.000
It's tragic that that three and five year old are spending their hard-earned mortgage

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.200
payments and their paychecks that they get for doing what?

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.200
Coloring well?

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.240
I mean, seriously, it's the parent that's taking them to Chuck E. Cheats.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.200
It's the parent giving them money to spend money on these games.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.960
I don't understand.

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.040
I don't even understand the problem here.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:30.420
I actually would take an unpopular opinion somewhat with this and say she actually kind

01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.120
of has a point with this whole thing.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:38.400
I do think this is probably not healthy for all children, but at the same time, why sue

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.960
Chuck E. Cheese over it?

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:44.040
That's ridiculous because you absolutely have the right to not go there.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.040
And you know what?

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:50.260
I bet if enough people didn't go to Chuck E. Cheese and didn't go to have their birthday

01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.100
parties at Chuck E. Cheese and let their kids have birthday parties there, they would probably

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:57.520
have to get rid of these machines or the company would go bankrupt or maybe they'd go back

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.880
to having legitimate arcade games.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:42:59.880
I don't know.

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.340
I want to know why, you know, all of these, because ticket redemption games have been

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:06.640
around forever since I was a little kid.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.640
Right.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.640
It's not forever.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:09.640
Don't say that.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.640
Anyway.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:14.400
Um, but why is it that we're just now getting somebody complaining about it?

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.560
I really don't get it, especially when everybody else seems to be just fine with it.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.920
People can get addicted to anything.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.200
I'm not finished.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.200
Sorry.

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.200
Thank you.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.840
The, the whole point is that it's a parenting issue.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.760
You don't want your kids to participate in something.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.200
You don't take them there or you don't let them play it.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.760
Um, Salacious Pop in our chat room says many ticket games are a test of skill.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.800
Some ticket games are goddamn bullshit.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.800
Agreed.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.720
Uh, The Legend of Zaku says, remember kids, America equals Sue the bastard's land.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.840
You know, he kind of has a point.

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:49.960
I almost see she's teaching these kids a worse lesson by going through with this lawsuit.

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:50.960
This is my opinion.

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.320
Well, that's the way it is now.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:57.120
If people find an opportunity to make money, they're going to gamble their chances and

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:58.120
do it.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.840
I mean, it's all it.

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.560
People can make the argument that they can be addicted to anything.

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.960
So, so we get rid of everything because that's really what it's going to come down to.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.960
You get rid of these ticket redemption games, they're going to say, oh, well, I'm addicted

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.440
to winning at arcade games.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.240
Then you get rid of the arcade games.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:21.700
Well, oh, well, I'm addicted to, uh, I don't know, um, riding in a little motorized cars

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:24.840
that they have at, you know, Chuck E. Cheese or something like that.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.400
Well, then we got to get rid of those too.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.000
Oh, well, now I'm addicted to eating pizza.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.680
Let's get rid of pizza.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:31.680
Where does it stop?

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.760
I mean, it's just people are going to be finding anything to sue over.

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.520
And this, unfortunately, is the latest in many, I'm sure lawsuits that are going to

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.620
be in our legal system forever.

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:47.880
We've already had this regarding casinos.

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:53.120
We've already had it regarding online gaming, you know, just put it this way, people, it's

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.840
like you're saying, people do have addictive personalities.

01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840
The thing exists.

01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.200
Everyone's going to have their crack, whether it's, you know, watching Monday night football,

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:07.000
ooh, or, you know, people get obsessed about things that they're into.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.800
It's just a matter of teaching people to control themselves.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.660
And quite honestly, if a person can't control themselves, well, that's not my problem.

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:15.160
Why should my life be affected by that?

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.680
God forbid the kids have fun playing a game, you know?

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:20.680
Oh, hey, let's try to earn some tickets to go get a prize.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.900
Oh, that's just blasphemy.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:26.800
Why are we letting these kids, you know, get addicted to getting tickets?

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.960
They're not getting addicted to getting tickets to her kids.

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.160
They're having fun.

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.640
If they have a problem, they're like, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I need you to take me back and

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.080
go get more tickets so I can get a bigger prize.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.040
Well, then know what you do, you say, no, I'm not fucking taking you back to get more

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.040
tickets.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:44.200
And if they cry and have a tantrum, then you give them a time out or you spank them.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.720
Is it seriously that terrible to parent your child?

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:52.640
I mean, shit, I know as being a parent, it's not that hard to say no.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.680
And not only a parent, a Mensa member.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:01.080
That doesn't mean it's a smart thing to do, right, Logie?

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.840
This is what smart people do.

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:08.200
I can't say that Akuma JP in our chat, literally, I cannot say that because you can literally

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:12.000
get kicked out of Mensa for saying as a Mensa member, I really, yes.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Oh my God.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Can I just lie?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.520
It's not a tangent here.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.360
Can I lie and say I'm a Mensa member and just say as a Mensa member, I'll get sued.

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.320
I'll probably, no, no, no, no, no.

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:25.040
There's some, some hilarious shit in here.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.600
Sorry to get sidetracked here very quick.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:28.520
I was going to read this comment real quick.

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.280
Akuma JP in our chatroom at chat.orangishontraday.com.

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.160
Logie is addicted to Grand Theft Auto for sure.

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:39.600
Oh yeah, I don't, no, seriously, I spent an unhealthy amount of my day thinking about

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.480
Grand Theft Auto, playing Grand Theft Auto.

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.400
I may or may not be addicted to World of Warcraft.

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:48.040
And let's face it, everyone is addicted to video games.

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.140
No, no, it's not that I'm addicted to Grand Theft Auto.

01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:55.420
I have fun playing Grand Theft Auto, and I have fun modding Grand Theft Auto.

01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:58.720
Why is that a problem that I like doing something, you know?

01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720
It's not like I can't stop.

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:02.720
You're not allowed to have fun.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.600
Okay, um, I'm just going to tell you something.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.600
It's just really hilarious.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.320
I got to find, and my wife was reading this to me because she was, oh, here it is.

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:17.640
I think this is it right here.

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.320
Here's some rules or whatever that they have.

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.720
Oh, member policies, let's see here.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.760
Are you allowed to read these?

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.760
Well, it's not like it's, you know, some secret guide or something.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.760
That's not masonry.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:39.160
Well, I, okay, anyways, one of the things, yeah, you can't really, you know, say something

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:44.440
as like saying, oh, well, as a member of Mensa, you know, I believe, blah, blah, blah.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.800
But that wasn't even the part that I thought was ridiculous.

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:52.840
They give you a sample press, I kid you not, a sample press release of how you can form

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:56.760
your own press release to send out to your local paper and your friends saying that you

01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:57.760
got in the Mensa.

01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:59.320
No, I'm not that vain.

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:00.320
Sorry.

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.320
I, you know what though?

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.460
Like in the, it may be in a suburbia town, you know, in a big market like Sacramento,

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:08.920
you know, as much as we joke about ourselves, we are still like what the 20th largest market

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:09.920
in the nation.

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.080
But go to like the Midwest and a lot of those little towns, maybe it is kind of a big deal.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:18.920
It's just like, you know, putting a big giant sign on my back that says, nerd, make fun

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:22.560
of me and beat my ass while you're at it.

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:29.440
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm not going to invite that kind of, um, attention.

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.440
All right.

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:34.880
Well, the next story up is dark soccer is, but she's left, so she has left the building.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:40.400
Let's talk more sewer for not fulfilling your obligations to garden burgers and I was preparing

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400
mine.

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.400
All right.

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.400
So that's it.

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:44.400
I'm suing garden burgers.

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.400
We're going to get rid of those crap.

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.400
God damn you.

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.400
Garden burgers.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.120
I'm now available for beta for PC gamers.

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.120
Shut up, Dan.

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.440
I love you.

01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.800
Okay.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:04.320
So for people who want to do more for portal to valve has portal to authoring tools.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320
Yay.

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.520
If you've got a PC, you can do this.

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.320
Um, it's free for anyone who owns the game on PC and it's in the tools tab on your steam

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.680
account.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.400
So I'm basically, you'll just be able to go into everything, character skins, a single

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.160
player, co-op level, sound effects, music, 3d models.

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.160
They are all there.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.980
You can do them all.

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:34.960
But there's also nasty, Hey, there's also an updated version of face poser and a different

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.300
example maps and instances to help you learn.

01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:44.640
So there's a new suite of command line compiling utilities.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.480
I want someone to make the orange lounge level, made the orange lounge level.

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.480
Put it up.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.480
All right.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:54.300
Why are you looking at doors?

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:59.520
I'm looking at something from online, something that, uh, Alan's doing.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.520
All right.

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:01.520
Moving on.

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.800
He's probably giggling that that came out.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.800
All right.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.800
Uh, moving on.

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.800
Loki.

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.800
What do you have for us?

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.800
Yes.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:10.000
So this is kind of funny.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.480
Apparently the PlayStation one classics, they've been slow to sell.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.000
Um, really?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.640
No one's wanting to buy your PlayStation one games to play them on a device that most likely

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:29.320
doesn't have, uh, buttons, but no, these are actually meant for the, uh, Xperia play phone

01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:32.120
that you know, the PlayStation phone, if you will.

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:40.720
Um, apparently I guess there's only, um, you know, a very few, uh, sales for each one.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:46.160
They're saying that under a thousand installs for each title, uh, co-orders two destruction

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:48.880
Derby, medieval siphon filter and jumping flash.

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.880
And most of those are actually only in the few hundreds.

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:57.320
Um, they're saying that also that, um, they're saying it's not really a concern since there's

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.720
only a few, um, at the, um, moment.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:07.200
Um, PlayStation one titles, um, here or there, there's more coming on a regular basis.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.000
He said, and as a whole, the PlayStation as a content provider exclusive to the device.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.400
So there's no real concerns.

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:17.080
It's a revolutionary device and it's shaking up the marketplace and we're very pleased

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.080
with it.

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:23.000
Um, also it should be meant, you know, there is a reason why that maybe it's not working

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:29.800
is because, um, not necessarily on the marketplace, but you can get it for that phone.

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:35.200
Um, there actually are other PlayStation emulators that you can download ROMs for and those don't

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.640
cost you anything.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:39.640
So maybe that's the issue.

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:42.700
I think a lot of people are just buying the phone because you know what?

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:50.000
It's kind of cool to play other games with buttons, you know, like some of the other

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.720
Android games.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:58.160
I, I, yeah, this whole like lack of buttons thing, just, I can't believe they've even

01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.480
sold as many as they have.

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.240
The sound is just absolutely terrible.

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:03.120
It's as terrible as the PSP go.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:07.480
Well, I, I mean, one of the things I think that they're, they're forgetting about is

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:11.880
like, listen, just because this, you know, system's a PlayStation and it's not really

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.920
a PlayStation Xperia play fine, you know, just because it has a PlayStation controller

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:21.360
set up on it doesn't mean people are going to necessarily buy just PlayStation one games

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360
with it.

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:27.620
I mean, you can get a bunch of other games that support this, you know, type of a controller

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:30.880
mapping and you can play those just fine.

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:35.020
Have you ever thought that maybe, you know, a game that was put out 10 years ago might

01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:38.280
not stand up well against, you know, some of the newer games?

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.840
Yeah, I think Sony's just losing touch there with what people want.

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:46.280
Granted, Cool Borders is a pretty fun game and Destruction Derby's not bad on its own

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:55.620
and Medieval's all right, but like, I don't know, it's just, they're showing their age.

01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:58.040
But you know, Kazurai's a real party animal.

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.200
He's hip to what the kids are into.

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.200
Exactly.

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:05.880
He's, he's, he's got his finger on the pulse of what's hot.

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:07.800
What gamers really want.

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:08.800
Absolutely.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:09.800
All right.

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:14.000
Yeah, when he's not partying in his, you know, yacht.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.320
Let's talk about the Xbox for a minute and their games on demand service.

01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:21.560
Of course, you can buy full games through the games on demand service and download them

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.920
to your hard drive.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.860
Usually these are games that have been out for a little while.

01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:28.920
You don't see a lot of stuff that comes out like as they're new, but this is interesting.

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:35.220
Cave is going to be releasing Death Smiles 2X directly to games on demand.

01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:38.280
There will not be a disc release in North America.

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:41.740
The game will cost $30, excuse me, $29.99.

01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:42.960
They're not translating it.

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.600
It's going to be straight up in Japanese.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:48.920
You are buying basically the import game, but playable on your Xbox 360 through games

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.040
on demand.

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.040
But because it's a shooter game, it's not like you need to have a real thorough knowledge

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:54.040
of Japanese.

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.320
You have to have no knowledge of Japanese, seriously.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:59.960
It's going to launch Tuesday, May 17th.

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.920
Facebook is where they announced this.

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:03.240
Boy, what a sign of the times.

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.720
Cave announced this on Facebook saying, quote, it will be giving this format a try for getting

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:11.320
some of our Japan-only shooters released overseas.

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:16.120
I have to be honest, it's kind of a neat idea.

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:19.760
Like, you know, there's a lot of people that really like import games and would like to

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.400
be playing them, and it sucks that the Xbox is region-locked the way it is.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.600
And import games are fucking expensive, so $30 for a game like that, even if they aren't

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:35.320
doing any translations whatsoever, it's awesome because you're saving yourself, you know,

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:40.800
probably about, you know, 50% of the cost of an import.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.800
I think...

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:42.900
Actually more than that, probably.

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:47.280
This would actually kind of discourage some of the hacking, because sometimes people hack

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.760
their systems to play import games.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:53.560
That's the reason why I hacked my original PlayStation 1.

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.560
So there you go.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:57.560
Interesting.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.600
I...

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.240
Maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale, eventually.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.040
$30, I don't know, I never...

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.000
I'm not, like, super good at shooters.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.760
Also, you know what's interesting about this?

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.860
By not getting a disc release, you won't be able to get it through Gamefly or anything

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:13.120
like that, or Rental, and you have to either pay the 30 bucks or don't play.

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.520
We'll see how well that goes over.

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.800
Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:22.840
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:27.360
DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out a few emails that she says,

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.040
hey, you guys should be reading, er, you guys should be, er, writing us more emails.

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.040
First email.

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.040
First email.

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:39.360
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here with a question for you all.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.040
After having done this radio show for a long time, do you ever get that itch to work closer

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.040
to the video game industry?

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.040
No, not at all.

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.040
Not at all.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.320
I mean, I know that Loki works in distribution, but do any of you feel like you would enjoy

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:54.120
having a hand in a game's development rather than simply reporting the news and your opinions?

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.200
Or do you prefer to stay at arm's length and pay no mind to the man behind the curtain?

01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.200
Absolutely.

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.380
And I've already pitched, you know, or I've already pitched the idea that I want to pitch

01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:09.080
an idea to Konami to, you know, it's tough actually going up to them and saying, listen,

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:12.920
I want to fix your franchise because they don't really take kindly to that kind of stuff.

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:18.640
But re-imagine and modernize a franchise, I suppose, would be the better way to do it.

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:19.960
But yeah, I'd love to do that.

01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:23.280
But at the same time, you know, I have a day job, so it'd be kind of hard to quit a day

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:27.280
job to go work on a game.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:31.560
And God knows they're not going to actually listen to one person that has an idea about

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:36.600
how they can improve a certain franchise because I'm sure they get thousands of emails from

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.080
people that do, you know, something very similar.

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:44.140
But if they were ballsy and wanted to take a chance, that'd be pretty cool.

01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:46.240
It's a question that's bugged me for a long time as well.

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.040
I finally decided to take the plunge and leave my steady e-commerce job for a spot in the

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:55.440
games industry as a programmer for GameSpyTech, who support matchmaking and other online infrastructure

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:59.620
for games such as Command & Conquer, Pokemon Black & White, Crysis 2, and most recently

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:00.940
Mortal Kombat.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:04.180
My fear is that I'll become jaded to video games or just not be able to keep up with

01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:08.160
the crazy hours that I've heard you need to put in to make it in the industry.

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.940
So OLR men and women, what are your thoughts?

01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:14.040
Are you content to admire the industry from afar or do you want to dive into the trenches?

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.360
Yours truly is EHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient and general grammar advocate.

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.200
P.S. have started a scientific poll on my Facebook to prove that everyone appreciates

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.200
boobs.

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.960
Aside from the insignificant outliner data, the results support OLR's hypothesis.

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:31.840
Feel free to share it in chat so that I can obtain more data and I will copy it into chat.

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.840
There you go.

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:44.120
So I actually, if certain things require a relocation on our part, I'm planning on applying

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:49.280
with Valve, Nintendo, and Microsoft because what I want to do is publication.

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.240
Gee, I wonder if she might be thinking of relocating too.

01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:01.140
I'm wanting to do publication, like manuals, advertising, anything that's going to go into

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:04.640
a digital or physical print.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.640
I have to admit, I'm a little torn on it.

01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:08.680
I honestly have to say no.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:11.440
I don't think there's a lot I could contribute on the front lines.

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.440
I'm not a programmer.

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:13.440
I'm not an artist.

01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:16.720
Sure, I have ideas about games, but you know what?

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.600
Some people kind of do it a little bit better and I'm okay with that.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.040
I would have no problem being an advisor, a tracker, hell, having done this show as

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:28.080
long as I have, I think I could probably get away with being some type of games analyst.

01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.680
But at the same time, I have a day job I rather enjoy.

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:32.760
I make a decent amount of money.

01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.320
I don't really see myself leaving at any time soon.

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.240
However, I'm not going to lie, especially from the journalism ends of things, if I ever

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:47.000
had the opportunity to host a show about games, especially on TV, although there's such little

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.080
demand for that, I don't know how that would ever happen, I would jump at that opportunity

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:52.600
in a heartbeat, absolutely.

01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:55.280
Although I worry I'm starting to get a little old for that.

01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.600
A lot of that stuff is targeted towards 20-somethings and teens and now I'm starting to enter my

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.600
mid thirties.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:04.680
So I don't know if I would really be wanted for that.

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:08.440
I would tell you what I would love, love, love to do more than anything.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:13.880
I would love to host a game show as especially like a throwback to the old Starrcade.

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.560
Because Rob's hero is Bob Barker.

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.760
Even something like Nick Arcade or something like that.

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:18.760
You want to be painted orange.

01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:23.920
I love Bob Barker, but I also love Jean Rayburn from old seventies match game.

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:24.920
Like I would say.

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:27.040
You know who my person is?

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.040
Dude from Press Your Luck.

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.040
Oh, Peter Tamarkin.

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040
Tamarkin.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.040
Tamarkin.

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.040
Tamarkin.

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:37.280
So yeah, I would absolutely leave my day job in a heartbeat to go be a game show host.

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:43.120
In fact, I actually had an old boss who thought she heard of some TV station casting for who

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:47.220
wants to be a game show host, and she told me I could take leave from work to participate

01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:48.220
in that show.

01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:50.440
And she said that it's possible to be arranged.

01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:53.160
Unfortunately that show didn't turn out to be legit, but if they ever had something like

01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:56.120
that, I'd go on in a heartbeat, absolutely.

01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:01.280
But at the same time, we've been doing Orange on the Radio as a hobby for nine years now.

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.680
And just radio in general.

02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:06.640
I was on Understation Live before that and was doing college radio before that.

02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:10.300
Like the radio industry especially is highly competitive.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.760
And I kind of like the fact that we get to do radio on our own terms.

02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:16.040
Yeah, we're not the biggest show out there.

02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:19.580
A lot of people, even after nine years, have no idea who the fuck we are.

02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:23.980
But nobody gets between me and you, the listener.

02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:25.480
Nobody gets between that.

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.120
Nobody tells us how to do our show but us.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.920
Nobody gets between Rob and his Calvin Klein's.

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:30.920
And that.

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.000
But like literally, no one tells us what to do.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.960
And unfortunately when you go commercial for that, you lose a lot of that.

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:40.960
Yeah.

02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:43.840
And so I don't know how much of that I'd be willing to give up.

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.560
If ever we took any kind of sponsorship, it'd still have to be on our terms.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:48.560
Absolutely.

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.220
Which is why we'll probably be independent forever.

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:56.000
But that's, I think it's the way at least ye small but loyal few like it.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.200
And that's how we roll.

02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200
That and we have Shermie.

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.160
That's where we all, we'll always have Shermie.

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:03.160
Yeah.

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.160
So.

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.160
Dances would sell out.

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:08.600
I think he's full of crap.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:09.600
I don't know.

02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.260
Like I just, I think it's unrealistic to think like, oh, suddenly big name gaming website

02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:18.140
dot com wants to buy OLR as their official show.

02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:22.320
Like I think we'd be really stupid and naive to think something like that would actually

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.320
happen.

02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.620
I, I just, we've been, I totally think it's going to happen.

02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:30.400
If it was going to happen, it would have happened in 2006 when podcasting first broke.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.000
If it had happened and you guys didn't take the money, I would kill all three of you.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Hold on, hold on.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Dan, Dan, say that on the mic.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.500
I think he might've got picked up, but, uh, my husband likes to just come in here and

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:42.500
shout things.

02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.320
He said, if we didn't take the money, he'd kill all of us.

02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:46.200
Um, I, I will say this though.

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:50.900
There's definitely, I think, I think one thing we always want to make sure we do here at

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:54.100
orange launch rate is we don't want to rest on our laurels too much.

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:58.540
And I think if there's ways we can push things forward and push ourselves more and push the

02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:01.020
hobby forward, we're going to try and do that.

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:06.120
So I'm not saying anything, but trust me, we're always thinking about how can things

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.300
be even better than they are right now?

02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:16.380
But on our terms, very important on our terms.

02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.020
Yes.

02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.020
Next email.

02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:20.020
Yes.

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:23.020
Destructoid article that's linked by Rob-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:25.820
I was getting my b-b-b-b's ready.

02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:28.980
Originally scheduled for launch sometime this month, Nintendo has pushed back the already

02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:33.420
late release because it should have been ready when the damn system was out of the 3DS eShop

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.420
until June.

02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:37.700
According to the company, North America will get it June 6th and Japan will get it June

02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:38.700
7th.

02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:39.700
So hey, we get it first.

02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:40.700
Neener.

02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.220
Well, technically it's sort of at the same time.

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:48.140
I was emailing a friend about this and I also mentioned the big three addresses by Microsoft,

02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:49.780
Sony and Nintendo respectively.

02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:56.740
I realized that the eShop will open the day Microsoft and Sony talk, open on the day Microsoft

02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:59.260
and Sony talk June 6th, USA, June 7th, Japan.

02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:00.260
How clever.

02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:03.900
Rob-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.240
Last two emails.

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.500
I'm glad they finally got it back up.

02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:10.180
This is called thoughts on PSN.

02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:12.180
They got it up.

02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:17.100
While it's still unclear if their security was up to standard before, I'm confident

02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:19.420
slash hopeful it will be now.

02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:21.400
Another incident like this would be devastating.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.620
On the other hand, once it's fully up and running, many gamers will be quick to simply

02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.580
go back to their favorite games.

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:30.220
Personally, I had other options so I didn't feel very put out when it was done.

02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:31.220
Same here.

02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:35.540
And got a bit lucky that I picked up Portal 2 and had it linked and downloaded to Steam

02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:38.140
before the disaster.

02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:42.980
Michael Pacher did a 24 plus minute video on how this will impact Sony.

02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:44.300
A very interesting watch.

02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:48.780
He certainly feels that while they lost money slash sales, they'll be fine.

02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.040
Here's the link and I will copy it in the chat room.

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:57.580
But for those listening, it's game trailers dot com slash video slash episode dash 215

02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:58.580
dash patch.

02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:01.400
I guess P-A-C-H is how it's written on there.

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:04.500
Dash attack slash seven one three nine zero zero.

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:07.260
So they're giving the analysts video time now too.

02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:10.980
I assume if you just go to game trailers dot com and search for his name you'll find it.

02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:14.020
Well yeah, but I'm thorough.

02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:18.580
I don't want to be a hater, but how is this guy any different from the indie podcast out

02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:20.400
there and all the speculation they do?

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:22.260
Like I realize maybe he went to school or whatever.

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:26.540
I got played by Morgan, what was it, uh, Webb Brish or whatever.

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:28.200
I'm really not trying to be a hater.

02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:31.620
Like everybody's gotta make a living, I get that, but I don't, like, why is his opinion

02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:32.620
so important?

02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:33.620
Dude, the guy is wrong.

02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:35.980
More times than he's right.

02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:37.980
And no one seems to remember that.

02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:38.980
I'm just reading the email.

02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:39.980
No, I know, I know.

02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:40.980
I'm responding to the email.

02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:41.980
Take care.

02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:42.980
Listen to the podcast every week.

02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:43.980
Keep up the good work.

02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:44.980
And it's from Sepwin.

02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:47.540
I will say this though, I actually, I do kind of agree.

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:49.940
I think Sony is going to recover from it in the long run.

02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:52.580
Um, I think they're going to feel a lot of hurt.

02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:56.380
And the real question might be, is Sony going to find this worth it to do it all over again

02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:57.940
with PlayStation 4?

02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:01.700
Uh, but I think at the end of the day, yes.

02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:07.700
I think, I think they will recover if Apple recovered from the antenna thing, if Microsoft

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:11.940
recovered from the red ring thing, if you know, they'll, they'll come back.

02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:12.940
It's Sony.

02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:16.860
Do you know they've already got a business, they've already adjusted their business model

02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:17.860
to accommodate.

02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:26.500
Also, uh, Bobby, did you know that PSN is back up and did you know that it still does

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:27.820
not deliver tacos?

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:28.820
I am sad.

02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:32.060
All caps, brown face, all caps, Bobby.

02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:33.060
I had to yell.

02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:37.380
That possibly is the best email ever actually.

02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:38.380
That is very sad.

02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:39.380
How was my caps lock voice?

02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:42.020
I want tacos as part of my PlayStation severance package.

02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:43.020
Can we get on that?

02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:44.580
I only got four emails, Rob.

02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:46.260
Well, we need more emails.

02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:47.260
No talk.

02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:49.980
That's why you didn't get tacos tonight.

02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:53.540
Send me more emails so that Rob will get me another taco.

02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:57.540
Send me emails so that dark soccer buys me a taco.

02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:02.100
I'll buy you a taco if you buy me a taco.

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.380
Dan says he's going to make tacos next week.

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.380
Awesome.

02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:06.380
Rad.

02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:09.000
All right, we're almost to the Skype line.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.860
Not just yet, but we will be there in just a moment.

02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:14.460
One eight seven seven game O L R or I use your name on Skype is orange lounge radio,

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:17.660
but first two more stories for you.

02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:19.060
Mm hmm.

02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:24.620
Um, so this is kind of neat though there, you know, as part of like the Xbox indie service,

02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:28.900
it's been very unpredictable when games are going to be released on there.

02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:33.240
It's kind of like, well, they're up for review now, so, uh, it should be out hopefully soon.

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:38.180
Well now actual indie studios can pick their publishing dates.

02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:44.860
Apparently, um, they will allow, um, people to be able to market their games actually

02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:50.780
have some sort of, um, set release date once it's past peer review.

02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:53.540
And um, that's kind of neat I guess.

02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:59.700
And I guess, uh, you know, such like events like the indie games winter uprising will

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:07.220
be more coordinated and, uh, you know, cause I guess some of their titles were, um, missed

02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:11.140
on that because of the release date whole thing.

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:17.700
Um, uh, they're saying also it's kind of a mixed to positive, um, feedback according

02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:19.380
to the development community.

02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:25.580
Um, some people like the decision and then, uh, saying that the chance to schedule a release

02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:28.260
helps them plan the game promotion more sensibly.

02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:33.180
Others noted that scheduling would, uh, likely lead to an open stampede to release on specific

02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:40.260
days like Friday and a game of chicken trying to figure out, uh, the best time.

02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:44.540
I think that's not really going to be an issue, but it's still kind of neat.

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:48.140
Uh, just a note for our live listeners, yeah, we're aware it looks like the stream is skipping

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:49.140
a little bit.

02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:51.820
Anyway, looking at the upload numbers, it looks okay now.

02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:56.540
It's not stalling like it was, but everybody in the studio make sure all your excess transmits

02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:58.340
are turned off cause we're skipping right now.

02:07:58.340 --> 02:07:59.940
It's having trouble uploading everything.

02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:03.020
It looks like we're okay right now looking at the numbers, but we were having a skippy

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:04.740
period for a minute there.

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:08.500
Anyhow, um, moving on, but otherwise there's not a lot we can do about it.

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.880
If the cable's not going to cooperate, then it's not going to cooperate.

02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:14.900
So we move on with one last story here tonight before we go to the Skype line, which if we're

02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:17.500
still skipping is really going to be a hoot and holler tonight.

02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:21.700
Uh, this is about Chrono Trigger, which funny enough Dark Soccer brought up earlier in the

02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:22.700
show.

02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:23.700
Chrono Trigger, guess what?

02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:25.340
It's coming out on Virtual Console.

02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:30.100
So if you do not own the Super Nintendo cartridge or you don't want to pay $70 for it or however

02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:34.660
much it goes for on eBay these days, you'll be able to pick up your copy on May 16th.

02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:39.060
Uh, don't know exactly how much, that's tomorrow, shit, probably by the time most of you are

02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:40.060
hearing this show.

02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:41.060
Uh, it's not online.

02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.060
If we hadn't learned that, are we?

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:48.660
Uh, anyhow, uh, it's just a straight up release of the Super Nintendo version, so don't expect

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.500
anything fabulous to be changed.

02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:53.740
That means you're not going to have the extra dungeons and stuff in the DS version, but

02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:54.740
there you go.

02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:55.740
It is coming out.

02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:59.500
No price announced yet, but everybody is speculating it will be 900 Wii Points.

02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:04.660
800 for a Super Nintendo game and that 100 point premium for the special of the special

02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:07.700
games, which honestly Chrono Trigger, it's probably worth it.

02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:10.340
So, uh, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people checking that out.

02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:13.900
And especially like if you were too young to remember Chrono Trigger, just never got

02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:17.140
a chance to play it back in the day, you really should check it out.

02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:21.460
Like I know, I know I sometimes hate on it on the show cause I don't think it's the best

02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:27.140
Super Nintendo RPG, but, cause I just, I love Final Fantasy 3 too god damn much, but, or

02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:28.820
6, whatever you want to call it.

02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:30.860
But uh, it's, it's really good.

02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:31.860
It's really good.

02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:32.860
You want to know what's great?

02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:33.860
Huh?

02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:40.700
Now keep in mind that I got the game in 95, 96 when it came out for, well, first of all,

02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.820
my friend loaned it to me and then he moved.

02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.540
Um, my save file is still intact.

02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:46.540
Oh wow.

02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:47.540
Yeah.

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:51.980
Well, you know, a lot about those batteries were only ever guaranteed to last five years,

02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:55.180
but most people I know with old NES cartridges, those things still work.

02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.180
Yeah.

02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:57.180
It's just a lithium battery.

02:09:57.180 --> 02:09:58.180
It depends on how much you used it.

02:09:58.180 --> 02:09:59.180
Yeah.

02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:01.180
I mean, if you, as long as you don't have the game on 24 seven.

02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.180
Yeah.

02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:03.180
So interesting.

02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:04.180
Interesting.

02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:07.820
Now our Saturn batteries, however, have burned and burned and burned and burned.

02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:08.820
All right.

02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:12.860
We are going to now open the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username

02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:14.220
on Skype is orange launch radio.

02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:18.700
I'm going to really hope our live transmit issues don't get in the way, but the sky,

02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:23.500
excuse me, hiccups, the Skype radio's worst enemy, uh, the Skype line is now open for

02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:24.500
your calls.

02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:27.780
If you want to give feedback on any of tonight's topics or anything else that might be on your

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:28.780
mind, look at that.

02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:29.900
It's already ringing.

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:33.780
We will of course also go to look you as some last minute stories in between calls higher

02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:34.780
on orange launch radio.

02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:35.780
Who's this?

02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:36.780
It's the one and only Ron.

02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:37.780
How's everyone?

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:38.780
Who else gets in first on this show?

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:39.780
How are you?

02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:40.780
Rama?

02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:41.780
I'm pretty good.

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.780
I'm pretty, pretty happy.

02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.780
That's all.

02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:44.780
You're happy.

02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:45.780
Why are you happy?

02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:46.780
There's no start a new job.

02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:47.780
Come tomorrow.

02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:48.780
Oh, well that's a reason to be happy.

02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:49.780
Congratulations.

02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:50.780
Thank you.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:51.780
What kind of job are you going to be doing?

02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:54.820
If you don't mind me asking, I'll still be doing tech support in the school district,

02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:58.540
but with a different company with a lot more pay and better benefits.

02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:01.180
Well, more pay and better benefits are always a good thing.

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.180
Congrats.

02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:03.180
Thanks.

02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:04.180
Awesome.

02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:05.180
So what's in your mind tonight gaming wise?

02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:06.180
Oh, a couple of things.

02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:10.980
I wanted to kind of finish up what I was trying to talk about last week about Nintendo and

02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:12.540
their touchscreen controllers.

02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:13.540
Yeah.

02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:17.900
I could tell you that they won't be that expensive because touchscreens are not that expensive

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:18.900
per se.

02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:22.540
It's the software that powers it that makes it more expensive.

02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:26.460
What I see is it's probably like a simple controller with a touchscreen in the middle

02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:31.260
of it preset for certain buttons to do certain things in according to the way the game is

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.380
going to be.

02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:33.580
I can actually agree with that.

02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:36.420
It seems like almost everything has a touchscreen in this day and age.

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:39.580
Like pretty much every smartphone these days has one.

02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:43.020
Like I was talking about earlier when we were talking about the Nintendo, the new Nintendo

02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:49.780
console in the first place, the touchscreens on the printer devices, those things.

02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:50.780
Yeah.

02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:51.780
I've seen those.

02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:52.780
Yeah.

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.700
I don't think the touchscreens will be that expensive.

02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:58.660
It's just, you know, all this other stuff too, you know?

02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:00.020
Pretty much.

02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.140
So what do you, what are your expectations for the new Nintendo console?

02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.860
We are only three weeks away from E3.

02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:11.940
They're saying it's going to be on par with the 360 and the PS3.

02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:17.060
Just show me what it can do and what, and the features.

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:18.060
That's it.

02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:20.260
I'm a very simple person with basic needs.

02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:23.860
I mean, if there's going to be some great gaming on it, I will pick up the console.

02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:31.300
If it's going to be the Wii 2nd gen with more shovelware, it can stay on the shelf and collect

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:32.860
more dust.

02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:38.380
Well, you know the golden rule of OLR, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:39.380
Yes, indeed.

02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:41.060
That's the problem with the 3DS right now too.

02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:44.620
You know I left my 3DS here after the show last week and never bothered to come get it.

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:45.620
Well, actually that's a lie.

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.260
I did try to come by Monday, but nobody was here.

02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:49.260
So, because I was in the neighborhood.

02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:50.260
But yeah.

02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:51.260
Quite understandable.

02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.260
I didn't really miss it that much.

02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:57.420
I took mine out of my bag because I didn't like lugging it back and forth around because

02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:58.420
I'm not using it.

02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:00.220
Now I have no one to street pass with.

02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:02.220
Oh, darn.

02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:03.220
You're going to street pass with me.

02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:04.220
Take it to E3.

02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:06.500
Try to street pass with people there.

02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:07.500
You're going to loiter outside E3?

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:08.500
Bobby will street pass with me.

02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:12.100
Yeah, I'm going to loiter outside E3 just to street pass.

02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:14.440
I'm just going to walk around with a big cardboard sign.

02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:15.620
I should do this.

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.260
Big cardboard sign.

02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:19.780
Media not good enough to get into E3.

02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:21.780
Please street pass with me.

02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:24.780
That would be fun.

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:25.780
Wow.

02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:26.780
Anyhow.

02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:30.780
Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:34.780
Yes, in regards to PAX East 2012.

02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:35.780
Yes.

02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:36.780
Okay.

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:42.380
I expect this to be announced soon, but I don't know if you know, but next year PAX

02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:45.180
East is the same weekend as Anime Boston.

02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:46.180
Oh, snap.

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:47.180
City of City.

02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:48.940
Two separate convention centers.

02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:49.940
Oh my god.

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:50.940
Yeah.

02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:54.860
That's going to be a mess.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.420
That is bad planning.

02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:57.420
I'm sorry.

02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:59.420
That is bad planning.

02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:06.260
Yeah, I know, but the problem is sometimes when these convention centers have these dates,

02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:08.220
it's like take it or leave it, you know?

02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:12.920
So that's probably what it boiled down to.

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:14.180
But here's the thing.

02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:19.380
This was announced at Anime Boston's Masquerade, and I actually talked to a few people that

02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:23.820
are staff and that was there that actually verified this, but it will not surprise me

02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:25.520
if this changes.

02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:31.700
They made the announcement that if you purchase a pass for Anime Boston 2012, it is good for

02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:36.900
entrance to PAX East 2012 as well, and they will have shuttle buses going between both

02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:39.740
convention centers.

02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:45.020
That's a little weird to me considering the attendance caps that PAX keeps hitting.

02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:50.220
Like why would you want to, you know, because if everybody who goes to Anime Boston gets

02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:54.900
a free pass into PAX, that's less people that can go to PAX.

02:14:54.900 --> 02:15:00.220
So that seems like, if I were on the PAX, I wouldn't agree to that if I were behind

02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:01.220
that show.

02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:05.860
I figure it's like, you know, you got so many gamers going to this convention, you got so

02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:10.420
many anime fans going to this convention, give them a free pass, check out the other

02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:11.420
side per se.

02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.660
Well then why not, is the other half going to be true too?

02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:17.820
It would not surprise me if it is.

02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:21.980
But correct me if I'm wrong, Anime Boston is going to be at the old convention center,

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:22.980
the Heinz, right?

02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:23.980
Yes.

02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:27.940
And then the Uber one that PAX is at this year is where PAX will be.

02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:31.500
What if everybody decides to go to Anime Boston one of those days, I mean that Heinz place

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.500
is going to collapse?

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:39.860
Honestly, with the numbers that PAX East generates, I find that hard to believe because I'm planning

02:15:39.860 --> 02:15:41.820
to do PAX East instead.

02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:48.020
And knowing how some fans are, how lazy they can be per se, no offense, but to be perfectly

02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:52.800
honest, I don't think a lot of them are going to take shuttle buses to go 15 minutes across

02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.100
town to another convention and then come back.

02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:58.620
One of the two needs to move, end of story, one of the two needs to move.

02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:00.580
They shouldn't be the same weekend.

02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:05.140
I know, but this is what I'm hearing from a lot of my sources, that this could be the

02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:07.220
end for AB, who knows?

02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:10.560
Well then move, you know?

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.220
I don't know, that's going to be tricky.

02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:15.940
It's going to be an interesting weekend next year.

02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:19.500
I know, I am curiously seeing how this is all going to play out.

02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:24.100
It's still a long ways away all things considered, so some things may change, we'll see.

02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:27.020
I don't doubt your sources, but I'm still skeptical.

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.340
It seems like wishful thinking on Anime Boston's part.

02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:34.100
I know, it wouldn't surprise me as if AB says this is what they're going to do.

02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:38.180
Wouldn't surprise me if PAX comes out and says, yeah, you buy one of our badges, it's

02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:39.180
not good for AB.

02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:45.620
Maybe they're trying to be all buddy-buddy, friendly-friendly, because you have two different

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:50.340
convention companies in the same town fighting for top dog, or in this case, a one-legged

02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:51.340
ass-kicking contest.

02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:55.680
Yeah, and I was going to say, you'd think in most situations the two would be fighting

02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:01.380
each other, but I'm sorry Anime fans, PAX, with the people that come as far away as they

02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:06.620
do, you know, all the way from like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and all like the southern

02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:11.220
East States, you know, because that's still the closest thing they've got, I'm sorry,

02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:14.580
Anime Boston's going to get their ass handed to them if they stay that same weekend.

02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:18.160
And you're absolutely right, but the funny thing is, there are people that travel as

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:21.780
far south as Florida and Texas that come up to Anime Boston.

02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:22.780
Why do they do it?

02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:23.780
For the guests.

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:27.620
But for next year, you may travel way across the country for the guests, but as for me,

02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:30.500
I'll travel way across the country to check out these great games.

02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:31.500
Yeah.

02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.500
True.

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:33.500
True.

02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:34.500
All right.

02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:35.500
Yes.

02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:36.500
We gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much, buddy.

02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:37.500
Hey, no problem, dude.

02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:38.500
Take care.

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.500
Bye.

02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:40.500
All right.

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:41.500
Later.

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:42.500
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us

02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:43.500
a call.

02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.700
Uh, Loki, any last minute stories while we wait for a call?

02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:46.220
Yeah, there's some weird stuff.

02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:47.940
Um, this is kind of funny.

02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:50.380
I don't know if you remember the game YouStar2.

02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:56.180
It was kind of like a karaoke sort of game where you reenact scenes for movies and stuff

02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:57.180
like that.

02:17:57.180 --> 02:17:58.180
Looked dumb.

02:17:58.180 --> 02:17:59.380
Yes, it was terrible, actually.

02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:03.900
I've played it, but there's some free download content coming out, and guess what it ties

02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:04.900
into?

02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:05.900
What?

02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:06.900
The Royal Wedding.

02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:07.900
That's ridiculous.

02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:11.140
Yes, it will allow players to replace either Prince William or Kate Milton, so you could

02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:12.140
do a...

02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:13.140
Wait, I can be Princess Kate?

02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:14.500
You can be Princess Kate, yes.

02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:15.500
I mean, he's actually...

02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:18.980
In their first public kiss following the Royal Wedding.

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:19.980
Wow.

02:18:19.980 --> 02:18:21.260
It says the scene's offered free.

02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:23.820
Clearly, I attempt to subvert otherwise rational people.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:25.300
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.300
Let's go back to the phones.

02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:27.300
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:28.300
Who's this?

02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:30.060
Oh, I thought I had a call.

02:18:30.060 --> 02:18:31.060
I guess not.

02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:32.060
I guess I missed it.

02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:33.060
Sorry.

02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:34.060
Keep going.

02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:37.380
Um, so yeah, apparently there's gonna be some other footage and stuff that's available.

02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:40.340
But seriously, though, I've played USAR 2.

02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:45.740
It's a cool concept, but it's so terribly executed.

02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:46.980
It's such a terrible game.

02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:50.780
My favorite is how the camera cannot frame you properly.

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:55.940
I remember my coworker playing it, though.

02:18:55.940 --> 02:18:59.900
He's just like, he's doing this scene and it's framed so his head's at the very bottom

02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:00.900
of the screen.

02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:01.900
It's hilarious.

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:02.900
Alright, let me go to the phones.

02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:03.900
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:19:03.900 --> 02:19:04.900
Who's this?

02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:05.900
It's Death Wishing.

02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:07.780
Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:13.300
I'm playing a very amazing gem of a game that people need to start playing again.

02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:14.300
What's that?

02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:15.300
Freelancer.

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:18.380
I have not even think I've heard of this.

02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:19.380
What is this game?

02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:28.460
It's a PC game from 2004, I believe, and it's kind of say, like, Eve Online, minus being

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.460
an MMORPG.

02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:33.580
But you can play it with, like, 200 people online at once, and you do missions.

02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:36.940
Think, like, Neverwinter Nights kind of style, you know, you can do missions and stuff, all

02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:37.940
that, but it's space combat.

02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:38.940
Oh, yeah, okay.

02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:41.940
It's pretty fun.

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:53.020
Anyways, that Nintendo thing, I'm kind of looking, I'm totally seeing fail in the future.

02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:54.020
Why so negative?

02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:59.180
Well, it's like, they're saying, oh, it's going to be, like, on par with PS3, Xbox 360,

02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:02.300
but then you see the thing about, oh, we're going to be inventing some new peripheral

02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:06.620
where you can, like, feel things, I'm like, oh, great, so now we're going to have a bunch

02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:09.620
of games instead of playing Wii Tennis, we're going to be playing Wii Tennis where we can

02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:11.780
feel like we're holding the ball, or...

02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:15.580
I kind of think the feel thing is bullshit.

02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:19.200
I truly think the feel thing is bullshit, that's not coming from the same source that

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:24.320
originally leaked the news about the Nintendo Wii Next system and the whole, that came from

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.320
a different source.

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:28.920
I really think the feel, I think the feel stuff holds about as much weight as the fact

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:36.300
that the revolution was going to project 3D graphics, remember that?

02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:40.940
So yes, I think there's a new Nintendo system, yes, I think the controller does have some

02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:45.100
type of video screen that probably has a touch on it, or at least some type of touch, I mean,

02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:50.740
who's to say that feel isn't just the fact that you're touching a screen?

02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:55.180
You know, that's still feel, it doesn't mean that you're getting that tactile response

02:20:55.180 --> 02:21:01.260
of, like, feeling snakeskin and petting a snake, so I don't know, I kind of think the

02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:07.900
whole, like, touch, I think that's just, like, weird, crazy fanboy bullshit, I truly do.

02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:16.580
Um, sorry, so I'm going down here, over here, uh, I bet you don't frickin' tend to think

02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:20.480
for us, it's also going to have a button that says, give Nintendo money, because anything

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:25.180
in there is going to put money regardless, it's going to sell, I know for a fact it will.

02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:26.180
Well, which-

02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:29.100
They got the soccer mom market on the Nintendo Wii.

02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:30.540
Yeah, but will you buy one?

02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:32.780
Do you own a Wii?

02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:38.620
Uh, I owned a Wii, I had it for three months, and then I was like, wow, this is the most

02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:42.020
gimmicky piece of crap I've ever owned, and I gave it to my cousins because I didn't want

02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:45.140
to sell it, so I gave it to some kids, I wouldn't use it.

02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:48.300
Do you worry you might make the same mistake with the new Nintendo system?

02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:53.820
Uh, I know I won't because I'm just going to switch to PC Master Race.

02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:54.880
Are you sure, though?

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:58.180
What could Nintendo announce on this thing that would make you be like, maybe I should

02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:00.180
get this?

02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:06.340
Um, that they're actually going to make a new Goldeneye that isn't stupid and handle

02:22:06.340 --> 02:22:09.420
like ass, and my ship just blew up.

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:12.700
Well, have fun in the PC Master Race.

02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:18.940
Alright, alright Death Wishing, we'll be looking for your reactions after E3.

02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:25.140
Alright, well, um, have fun with whoever's coming, like I was going to PAX East or whatever,

02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:27.540
have fun with all the Japanese Wii, there's an anime.

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:28.540
We will.

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:29.540
Alright.

02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:30.540
Bye.

02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:31.540
Bye.

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:35.180
There's going to be some great, like, crossover interviews and things like that.

02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:39.620
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:42.620
I really think Anime Boston's going to be forced to move weekends.

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:47.900
I know, you know, I know there's only so much convention center space and so on, but, uh,

02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:50.060
think outside the box, people.

02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:54.020
Anyhow, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:57.140
In the meantime, more last minute stories from Loki!

02:22:57.140 --> 02:23:02.900
There's an NES cartridge that's being developed that will turn your NES into a MIDI synthesizer.

02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:09.060
It's called Chip Maestro, it was actually part of a Kickstarter program, and for $50

02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:12.940
you can grab one of these cartridges that plugs into a MIDI keyboard and you can start

02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:21.700
creating your own 8-bit sounding music using a keyboard, it's kind of cool.

02:23:21.700 --> 02:23:29.060
And then, of course, there is a new Xbox Live and PlayStation Network game that's been announced.

02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:32.180
Jeremy McGrath Offroad.

02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:37.180
No word on what the game is exactly, obviously it's going to be a Baja Racing type of game.

02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:42.980
It's actually being developed, I guess, from the people that did Baja Edge of Control for

02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:48.620
THQ, and I guess they've also done some work on the MX vs ATV series, so they've got a

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:52.820
good pedigree there, but don't really know that many details about it.

02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:58.100
People are kind of hoping that it's maybe a spiritual successor to Ivan Ironman Stewart's

02:23:58.100 --> 02:23:59.460
Offroad Racing game.

02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:00.460
That game was fucking awesome.

02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:02.500
Alright, let's go to the phones, we've got another call coming in.

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:03.500
1877, I'm sorry.

02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:05.500
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:07.500
You've already called the number.

02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:10.180
Hey guys, it's CD Thunder.

02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:15.100
CD Thunder, what's in your mind?

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:18.460
Well I have a couple of things to talk to you about.

02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:21.940
Go for it.

02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:24.180
There must be like hella lag going on here.

02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:25.180
Go ahead.

02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:32.900
Well, let's see, the two games I want to talk about, Perfect Dark and GoldenEye 007.

02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:34.820
Some classic games?

02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:36.380
Go for it.

02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:44.820
Well, I like them both, and the Perfect Dark is basically like a space version of the GoldenEye

02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:48.300
007, if you know what I'm talking about.

02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:49.380
These are some old games.

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:53.020
These games have been out a very long time.

02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:56.780
Are you just kind of getting around to playing classics, like rediscovering old stuff, kind

02:24:56.780 --> 02:25:00.140
of like our last caller's playing some PC game from 2004?

02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:02.580
Are you rediscovering classic games?

02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:08.340
Are you finding these through the new versions of GoldenEye or Perfect Dark Zero, or what

02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:11.340
has peaked your interest in these games?

02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:18.100
It's GoldenEye 007, talking about that, is actually one of the games we got when we got

02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:21.940
the Nintendo 64 for the first time.

02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:29.420
Oh, you're the guy that called in a few weeks ago, and you just recently got a 64, right?

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:35.220
Actually not recently, but a few Christmases ago or something.

02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:38.060
You don't have a lot of the new systems, right?

02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:39.060
You play on like...

02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:40.060
No, uh-uh.

02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:41.060
Okay, I remember you.

02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:44.020
All right, you've got like all the classic stuff in your house.

02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:45.020
So you're...

02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:47.260
Yeah, a lot of the good stuff.

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:51.020
You're gaming in a time capsule, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because there's

02:25:51.020 --> 02:25:54.980
a lot of shit out there right now, and so it really gives you time to focus on the classics.

02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:59.860
So you're kind of rediscovering a lot of these games like they're totally new, right?

02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:00.860
Yeah.

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:03.100
That's pretty cool, actually.

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:08.020
I'd like to be living in a bubble like that sometimes, because there's a lot of real crap

02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:09.020
out there right now.

02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:13.380
All right, well tell us, how was it playing Perfect Dark and GoldenEye for the first time?

02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:18.900
Well, GoldenEye I actually had a lot of fun with, I like the James Bond.

02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:23.900
So since it was James Bond, I really liked it a lot, and well, a lot of the levels are

02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:27.860
really difficult.

02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:33.300
And with Perfect Dark, it's space...

02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:34.580
Go ahead.

02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:36.180
Oh.

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:43.340
And the Perfect Dark is basically like a space age version of GoldenEye 007, except he plays

02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:49.820
a woman, and you have on-screen reloads, but in the GoldenEye 007, you have off-screen

02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:50.820
reloads.

02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:52.820
And the bitch can't jump.

02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:56.660
Yeah, she can jump only a little bit.

02:26:56.660 --> 02:26:59.680
You know, they made a new GoldenEye, in fact it's funny, I think one of the previous callers

02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.740
brought this up, they made a new GoldenEye last year on the Wii, so you'll be playing

02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:05.460
that in about 2018.

02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:10.540
But they made this game, and a lot of people aren't really fans of it, like they say it

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:13.700
blows, it isn't like the original at all.

02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:16.640
Why do you think people are so partial to the original GoldenEye?

02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.820
What is the charm in the original GoldenEye?

02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:26.780
Well because, it could be maybe because they like the movie, and because of that they like

02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:35.420
the game, and since they remade the GoldenEye 007 on the Wii with Daniel Craig, they're

02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:39.540
thinking it's a reboot of the original, so maybe that's one of the reasons.

02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:40.540
Alright.

02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:44.260
Well buddy, we're gonna let you go to take some more calls, but I'm just gonna leave

02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:48.300
you with this, don't bother with Majora's Mask, it's not nearly as good as Ocarina of

02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:49.300
Time.

02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:50.300
Just so you know.

02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:51.300
Alright.

02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:52.300
Alright, take care buddy.

02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:53.300
Thanks, you too.

02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:59.900
1877 game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:05.100
You know, I really do mean it, sometimes I kind of wish I could just kind of go back

02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:08.220
in gaming, like seriously, Super Nintendo?

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:13.420
There's so many good games on that, I probably still have yet to play, alright.

02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:17.580
And some folks in chatroom vehemently disagree with me, DarkToaGak in chat says, Majora's

02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:20.660
Mask is orgasmic, what the hell is Sky talking about?

02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:22.220
Majora's Mask was annoying.

02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:23.220
I didn't like it.

02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:26.940
Of course I always thought that Ocarina of Time was a little bit overrated too.

02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:29.620
I liked Ocarina, but my favorite's Silling to the Past.

02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:32.900
Alright, let's wrap up with last minute stories, Loki, if you had anything else.

02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:35.220
His last minute story is Portal.

02:28:35.220 --> 02:28:36.740
I had nothing else.

02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:38.160
Oh okay.

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:44.140
And I'm getting a private message about Square Enix might be going bankrupt, and I do remember

02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:48.660
reading the article online, I don't have it up in front of me, but I think they reported

02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:51.240
huge losses recently.

02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.540
And I assumed a lot, well I don't, like I think part of it they were trying to say might

02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:59.700
have been the tsunami, which makes sense, you know, obviously everybody heard from that.

02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:06.020
But I think a really large part of it that I don't think was really announced in the

02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:10.820
story was the utter dismal cataclysmic failure of Final Fantasy XIV.

02:29:10.820 --> 02:29:15.180
Because keep in mind, that game was supposed to come out on Playstation 3 by now, but it

02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:16.180
hasn't.

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:21.980
So yeah, I think Square's probably way overestimated what they were going to make last quarter,

02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:25.740
and I think a lot of that has to do with Final Fantasy XIV, honestly.

02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:29.700
Oh, I'm getting more information, thank you to the person who's messaging me right now,

02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:34.540
let me pull up this link in our little browser box here.

02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:37.740
Oh, and of course it's all in Japanese, I can't read that.

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:40.980
That's why you should use Nifty.

02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:48.420
No, I, oh yeah, I could use Nifty, hold on, or I could use Google Translate.

02:29:48.420 --> 02:29:52.900
But Final Fantasy XIII apparently plays into this as well, Final Fantasy XIII not quite

02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:57.780
selling as much as they thought.

02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.780
I'm translating it now.

02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:06.460
16 billion yen, extraordinary loss and damage.

02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:09.020
The earthquake did stop them to some development.

02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:13.620
Ah, they are attributing this to Final Fantasy XIV and postponing that.

02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:21.220
Let's see, they're thinking though the, they say the business environment is rapidly changing.

02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:29.100
Yeah, they do cite Final Fantasy XIV multiple times here.

02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:34.460
Final Fantasy XI, I guess it talks about that Final Fantasy XIV wasn't the same quality

02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:41.100
as Final Fantasy XI, and they actually apologized for the unusual situation it has become.

02:30:41.100 --> 02:30:42.100
Yikes.

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:47.980
Well, I, we told you when we first reported on Final Fantasy XIV, heads were gonna roll,

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:52.540
so Final Fantasy XIII-2 it sounds like might be delayed too.

02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:55.580
Good times!

02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:58.900
Alright that's gonna do it for Last Minute Stories tonight, I think we're all done.

02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:02.660
So this is the part we go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but first I'm gonna thank

02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:05.740
all you guys for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight, and remember if you like what

02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:09.580
you heard, you know, we got into this during the email bag, but we don't have big corporate

02:31:09.580 --> 02:31:14.100
dollars behind the show, we do this just because we like having a show, hanging out with each

02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:17.300
other and hanging out with you guys every Sunday, so tell some friends to come join

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:18.300
the party.

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:19.300
Lots of them.

02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:20.300
Open invite.

02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:24.260
So yeah, we hope to hear from your friends, tell a couple friends about the show, and

02:31:24.260 --> 02:31:28.260
spread the word about Orange Launch Radio, and you can keep having the show for free.

02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:29.660
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:31:29.660 --> 02:31:32.420
I'll start with the portal-loving Loki.

02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:33.900
Your final thought tonight.

02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:37.820
Uh, my final thought is we never did it after Use of the Week.

02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:38.820
No we didn't.

02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:39.820
Oh we didn't!

02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:41.820
Shit, I guess we should do that now then, shouldn't we?

02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:42.820
I don't care.

02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:43.820
You don't care?

02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:44.820
No, we can do it.

02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:45.820
Alright, here they go.

02:31:45.820 --> 02:32:03.700
F.U. to this little patch of Eximo on my right hand ring finger.

02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:04.700
The end.

02:32:04.700 --> 02:32:05.700
Loki?

02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:10.780
F.U. to the woman that wasn't watching where she was driving and hit the back of my car.

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:11.780
Doh!

02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:14.300
Um, F.U. to hangovers.

02:32:14.300 --> 02:32:16.300
I had a bad one this morning.

02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:18.500
Alright there you go, Loki, we did the F.U.s of the week.

02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:20.620
Uh, my F.U. of the week, er, not my F.U.

02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:27.620
My final thought, um, is weekend's already over and that makes me sad.

02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:28.620
Eh.

02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:29.620
Dark Sakura?

02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:34.740
He who controls the spice controls the universe.

02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:38.020
Alright that does it everybody, thank you again for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:39.780
What say we do it all again next week?

02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:40.780
Sound good?

02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:43.020
