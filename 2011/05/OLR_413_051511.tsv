0	19840	Tonight, May 15th, 2011, PlayStation Network returns after a three-week hiatus, a new entry
19840	24980	in a popular fighting franchise is announced, and a classic Sega Genesis video game is localized
24980	31840	for a new release.
31840	35240	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
35240	36240	Lounge Radio.
36240	38800	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38800	42620	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.
42620	45520	First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
45520	46520	Hi.
46520	47520	How are you?
47520	48520	I am accomplished.
48520	49520	You're accomplished.
49520	50520	Why is that?
50520	52680	Because I beat Portal 2 just now.
52680	53680	Congratulations.
53680	55720	I walked in like right as the ending was going on.
55720	59120	I'm not going to spoil what happens, but I was like, oh, it's this part.
59120	60120	I like this part.
60120	62440	So I like the all of that part.
62440	63800	I figured you would.
63800	64800	All right.
64800	67640	Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
67640	68640	Hello.
68640	70040	Now what is this you're eating tonight?
70040	71040	That looks burnt.
71040	77280	Yeah, they don't, they don't understand what well done means versus, you know, torch.
77280	78880	Your pizza looks burnt or dead.
78880	79880	It's certainly well done.
79880	80880	What is this?
80880	81880	Is this quadruple bacon pizza again?
81880	82880	No, it's still triple bacon.
82880	83880	Oh, my bad.
83880	89160	How, how, how dare I increase the bacon anyhow?
89160	90160	We're going to get into the show.
90160	94320	Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern
94320	99160	right after the Bobby black Wolf show at all games radio, www dot all games.com.
99160	100760	It's very easy to hear the show.
100760	104800	All you do is you go to all games.com and as long as you have what flash installed,
104800	105800	it comes right up.
105800	106800	So it's very easy.
106800	109760	You don't, you don't have to worry about any of those complicated, getting it into your
109760	111640	win amp or iTunes or whatever.
111640	112640	Very easy.
112640	116000	I said it were easy, but if you, but if you want to put it in, when you have an iTunes,
116000	117000	you can do that too.
117000	118760	There's more information at all games.com.
118760	123520	Um, also our chat room chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.
123520	126080	It's very important to know we don't use the normal all games chat room.
126080	127080	Why?
127080	128080	I don't know.
128080	129080	It's just the way we've done it.
129080	130080	And we've had our own chat room for like nine years.
130080	132840	Plus we like being in charge of our own chat room.
132840	134320	So it's a power thing.
134320	138220	Anyhow so chat dot orange lounge, radio.com is where you can join us to chat with us live
138220	141640	and give us your comments on what's going on, uh, such as break man in our chat room
141640	145000	tonight who says there is no such thing as too much bacon.
145000	146000	I don't know.
146000	150120	I think we remember when we had the bacon party for one of your birthdays and there
150120	152160	was like all these bacon dishes here in house.
152160	153440	That was, that was too much bacon.
153440	157740	I have to say actually the smell is turning my stomach.
157740	159640	I was going to have a heart attack.
159640	164720	So anyhow, well you need, you'll have to get some Febreze or something to smell.
164720	165720	I don't know.
165720	170360	I've got Moroccan spice Febreze to cover Shermy's ass.
170360	172520	Yes, it smells good.
172520	174080	All right.
174080	176920	Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into how was your gaming week.
176920	180260	Every week we talk about some of the games we've been playing this week, which I guess
180260	184160	every single podcast pretty much does that this day and age, but I swear we were doing
184160	185680	it this way for a long time.
185680	186960	Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?
186960	187960	How was your gaming week?
187960	193920	Well, I just beat portal two and I played some well and because certain people in our
193920	199200	guild are going to be helping me run through a dungeon and learn how to tank on Rebecca
199200	203240	black, I still love the character and I still have people's reactions.
203240	205440	I have made another character.
205440	211880	I remade my, my shaman and named her after my old, uh, one of my old tabletop characters.
211880	215480	His name is Bloodwin, very Welsh.
215480	218560	And uh, she's level 10, 11, 11.
218560	219560	She's 11.
219560	220560	Wow.
220560	222520	You're starting to sound like me.
222520	223520	I played.
223520	224520	Wow.
224520	225520	Wow.
225520	226520	And more.
226520	227520	Wow.
227520	228520	I'm getting pissed off though.
228520	231240	I'm getting pissed off at the core and nobody can give me the 300 gold.
231240	235320	I need to get, uh, you'll have to earn it.
235320	237040	Do a herbalism and mining.
237040	238040	That's how I did it.
238040	239760	You just go collect things for a while and then sell.
239760	240760	That's how you do it.
240760	244000	Then I just need to get rid of tailoring anyhow.
244000	246400	I don't want to fill up too much of a wow chat cause there's a whole nother show for
246400	247400	that now.
247400	249400	So anything else you've been playing this week?
249400	250400	No.
250400	253680	Seen any good movies lately?
253680	256960	I see a Tron thing behind you and that made me think like, Oh, Tron's on blue.
256960	261440	I'm supposed to go see, um, Thor on Tuesday with Becky.
261440	262440	Stay till after the credits.
262440	263440	I know.
263440	264440	That's what everybody says.
264440	265440	I know.
265440	266440	All right.
266440	268320	There's only one character in that whole movie I care about seeing and he's only in one part
268320	272240	cause it's my dude.
272240	273360	All right.
273360	274360	But no spoilers.
274360	275360	All right.
275360	276360	Loki, how was your gaming week?
276360	277360	What have you been playing?
277360	279560	Um, just really two things.
279560	285560	Um, you know, portal two and um, grant the data and portal two.
285560	291200	I've chapter eight and um, grand theft auto.
291200	292200	Well it's just grand theft auto.
292200	295960	We decided to start playing some grenade launcher only games, which is kind of fun.
295960	301360	Um, man, that's pretty much, that's about it.
301360	302360	Wow.
302360	304020	You guys both haven't been playing anything new.
304020	305020	That's all right.
305020	306280	Uh, let's see me.
306280	307880	Uh, actually a lot of it's the same.
307880	309360	I have not played a lot of new stuff.
309360	310360	A lot of the same stuff.
310360	313560	I've also been playing portal two, uh, a little bit of mortal combat.
313560	317760	Um, as is, you know, I know we're getting into this in the news in a little bit, but
317760	319680	it's pretty completely fucking obvious.
319680	323560	PlayStation network came back up yesterday, so I was finally able to get in there and
323560	328680	uh, play some mortal combat online and I got my ass handed to me cause I'm just, I guess
328680	330000	I'm just not good at fighters.
330000	331000	I don't know.
331000	332000	I need more practice.
332000	334080	Uh, but I was trying first match was a little laggy.
334080	338060	I was a little bit disappointed at how kind of laggy and it was one of those things where
338060	340280	the frames per second suffer.
340280	344580	Like that's how mortal combat kind of compensates for the lag is that your, your frames suffer.
344580	346680	But then I played another match today and it was fine.
346680	348940	It was very smooth and, and worked fine.
348940	353400	So I guess it really is just about who you're connecting to or the service is a little bit
353400	354560	wonky still.
354560	359600	Like I tried to log in today and I got the PlayStation is down for maintenance message.
359600	361880	So I did it like four times and it finally let me in.
361880	364400	So kind of weird how that's working, but whatever.
364400	368060	Um, otherwise, as far as new games go, there is one new game I've been playing this week
368060	371320	and uh, that is a downloadable game on Xbox live.
371320	375200	I believe it's on PlayStation network as well, but you know, haven't really been able to
375200	376600	tell for the past three weeks.
376600	378400	So, uh, it's on Xbox live arcade.
378400	382600	It's called might and magic clash of heroes, I think is what it's called.
382600	383600	It's a school.
383600	386720	Well, yeah, it's, it's interesting because it's, it's a DS game.
386720	391920	It was a DS game a few years ago, but I have kind of lost touch of the Nintendo DS scene
391920	392920	about four years ago.
392920	394640	There just hasn't really been a lot on the DS.
394640	397280	I really wanted to play that wasn't like a first party game.
397280	400520	Uh, but apparently this one was pretty good and I totally missed it.
400520	405200	Uh, so it's out now on Xbox live and apparently PlayStation network, not that you'll be able
405200	406840	to download that anytime soon.
406840	408680	Um, but it's a port of the DS version.
408680	412320	And from what I understand, they've done some redone graphics and things like that.
412320	414160	But let me tell you a little bit about the game.
414160	421920	It's very much a puzzle quest, gyro mancer, RPPG game, role playing puzzle game.
421920	425080	It's another one of these, um, the battle system.
425080	428400	If you watch somebody else play it, you're not going to understand what the hell is going
428400	432200	on, but it has a really good ramp up in the single player mode to kind of get you used
432200	433200	to things.
433200	437740	And the best way I could explain it, it's kind of like magical drop where you pull things
437740	440920	down from one column and put them in another column.
440920	445520	Only it's not like it doesn't move down slowly like magical drop does.
445520	450120	You only have a certain number of moves per turn and you do offensive attacks by vertical
450120	453580	lines and defensive attacks by horizontal lines.
453580	454580	So it's kind of neat.
454580	456960	And there's special pieces thrown in the mix.
456960	460080	And most importantly, you're playing head to head.
460080	464240	So there's like a line in the middle of the screen and you're working up towards that
464240	467080	middle line and your opponent is working, it's flipped.
467080	468960	They're working down in reverse.
468960	472040	So kind of neat how that makes the battle draw out.
472040	478240	So it's obviously because of that, it's a very slow paced RPG because each battle takes
478240	479320	some time.
479320	482840	But again, if you're into the puzzle quest two type of games where every battle is a
482840	486880	full Bejeweled match basically, this game is really right up that alley.
486880	493400	And I would say I actually found the game itself, the puzzle interface, to be kind of
493400	495120	a neat little thinker.
495120	498880	You know, and it's something a lot different from the Bejeweled-esque games, which pretty
498880	504440	much a lot of the other games that are out there in the RPPG series kind of fall into
504440	505840	right now.
505840	510400	Maybe the lone exception is that unremarkable one that Konami put out.
510400	514000	Puzzle Chronicles, I played that one for a little bit, didn't really find that that remarkable.
514000	516020	Sorry to Puzzle Chronicle fans.
516020	519240	But I did enjoy Puzzle Quest 2 and I enjoyed this Clash of Heroes.
519240	523120	So if you are into the puzzle games, you at least have to download the demo and check
523120	524120	it out.
524120	527900	That's the nice thing about Xbox Live Arcade and PSN whenever it's up, is that there are
527900	528900	demos.
528900	532900	So you know, there's not any harm in that other than I guess the bandwidth and time
532900	534280	to download the demo.
534280	537640	But yeah, if you're into the puzzle games, I really encourage you to check this one out
537640	540760	because I think it would be worthy to your collection.
540760	542960	Not just a single player mode, you can do Xbox Live matches.
542960	547040	I have not delved so far into that section yet, so I can't say a lot, but I can imagine
547040	551000	that is definitely something that the DS version probably didn't have.
551000	552180	Maybe it had it locally.
552180	555960	I don't know, I could be totally misstating, maybe someone in the chat will correct me.
555960	557440	I don't know if it had internet play.
557440	562640	Like I know DS has internet play, but obviously Xbox Live I think is a much bigger internet
562640	566320	audience than probably the DS was, so there you go.
566320	570440	Night Magic, Clash of Heroes, if you're into puzzle, RPPGs, check it out.
570440	572480	Otherwise that was pretty much my gaming week.
572480	576200	So let's get into housekeeping tonight, not a whole lot.
576200	578560	Still some shows coming up over the next few weeks.
578560	580680	We don't plan to have any weeks off anytime soon.
580680	585940	E3 week might be a challenge, which is weird because none of us are actually going to E3,
585940	590440	but Dark Soccer and I are going to LA.
590440	591720	Long story.
591720	593320	So we may or may not be back that Sunday.
593320	596280	I think we're going to try and make it back in time for the show, which would be good.
596280	597280	No promises though.
597280	598280	No promises though.
598280	599280	Exactly.
599280	600280	So we'll let you know a little closer.
600280	601280	So you have to stop by the cheese factory on the way back.
601280	602960	That's still what, about three weeks away?
602960	605960	So we got a little time to figure that all out.
605960	610320	Meanwhile join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash
610320	616840	OLR, and of course our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
616840	619560	Alright let's move on.
619560	622520	I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
622520	628320	CD Thunder in our chatroom says RPPG means Rob playing a video game rated PG.
628320	629600	Rob playing PG.
629600	632680	I guess my magic clash of heroes would be PG.
632680	636760	I mean there's cartoony sword fights, but no blood or anything like that.
636760	640520	Me playing Mortal Kombat would definitely not be rated PG because I giggle all the time
640520	642220	at the fatalities.
642220	644600	And I got to see the, what is it called?
644600	646800	Is that called the Deadpool?
646800	649640	Like I know that's also one of Dark Soccer's favorite comic book characters, but I think
649640	650640	it's what it's called.
650640	651640	The acid room.
651640	654320	I saw the stage fatality for that for the first time.
654320	655320	It was gross.
655320	656320	But I giggled.
656320	657320	It was funny.
657320	660400	I need to get my mom back over and show her that one.
660400	661600	You're supposed to bring the game over.
661600	662600	Oh my bad.
662600	663600	I forgot.
663600	664600	Well I mean at some point.
664600	665600	Come bring it over and play.
665600	668080	I need to take my phone for fantasy 13 back.
668080	669280	I'll go find it.
669280	670280	You better.
670280	671840	It's in the vault.
671840	672840	It's in there somewhere.
672840	675200	You know it's well taken care of.
675200	678600	Brakeman in our chatroom says Sky and Dark Sakura are going to Hollywood.
678600	680120	I bet they are going to be in a movie.
680120	681120	What are you hiding from us?
681120	682120	Hmm.
682120	683120	Maybe.
683120	684120	Maybe not.
684120	685120	Rama says.
685120	686120	A YouTube movie maybe.
686120	690600	Rama says Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and an all new team up special, Fear and Loathing
690600	691600	in Los Angeles.
691600	696000	Well we don't want to leave Loki out of all the fun stuff, but you know he has the baby.
696000	697000	We can't stop here.
697000	698520	This is Activision country.
698520	701520	Alright anyhow, let's move on.
701520	702520	Gaming news.
702520	703520	Start us off.
703520	704520	Loki.
704520	707480	So there was like a firmware update today for the PlayStation Network.
707480	708480	Yay.
708480	709480	3.61.
709480	713000	It's basically the update that makes you change your PlayStation Network ID.
713000	714440	It was yesterday, but nobody knew.
714440	715600	Today, yesterday, who cares.
715600	716600	It all blends together.
716600	719040	You know, I don't really give a shit.
719040	727920	B, U, C. And I will say, okay, according to this post, this post was made on the 14th.
727920	729880	That would be, oh that would be yesterday.
729880	732800	Well I don't know my days, okay, so what can I say?
732800	733960	They all just blend together.
733960	735560	They all blend together, seriously.
735560	736560	What day is today?
736560	737560	No, I don't know.
737560	744960	Anyways, so yeah, firmware update, um, and of course that of course led to the PlayStation
744960	752960	Network starting to come up, and I love this little very official Kazurai video where he's
752960	755760	like making a State of the Union address or something like that.
755760	758960	It was the blandest fucking message I've ever seen.
758960	763040	Like how bad, I'm like, I hate kicking these guys when they're down, but I was watching
763040	764560	it, I was falling asleep.
764560	768240	Like this is why people are drawn to Reggie Fils-Aime from Nintendo, because you feel
768240	774200	his enthusiasm, even when he's hawking such bullshit, like the vitality sensor or whatever,
774200	775800	you at least really feel his enthusiasm.
775800	781000	I think that's why he's very popular with gamers, but Kazurai is very, just like, so
781000	782000	vanilla.
782000	788640	Hello, my name is Kazurai, and I like to party.
788640	796920	We here at Sony embrace fun, hurrah, and I know my friends over here are now enjoying
796920	800320	the fun PlayStation Network.
800320	801480	Everybody happy.
801480	802480	Party time.
802480	805600	Fun, fun, fun, fun.
805600	808720	Yesterday was Thursday, tomorrow is Saturday.
808720	813000	Hold on, I actually want to play a little bit of this.
813000	815040	Did you watch this Dark Sakura?
815040	817760	Tell me if this does not scream, I am a party animal.
817760	822800	All the patients that you've shown as we work through this restoration process.
822800	827160	Since the attacks on our networks, we've been working around the clock to bring game and
827160	830060	media services back online.
830060	834320	The service is being restored in phases, and I'm pleased to say that the first phase has
834320	836840	now been launched in most regions of the world.
836840	840080	And then I just spent a bunch of- What is he doing with his hands?
840080	844720	He makes these very, very distinct, like, this is the part where I'm going to clasp
844720	845720	my hands.
845720	847840	The teleprompter tells him to.
847840	849240	You think?
849240	851600	Fast Pines.
851600	854120	Now for the secret ingredient.
854120	857520	And with the money that we have lost, we're going to actually be raising a few of our
857520	861040	rates in the next few months to pay for this new teleprompter.
861040	865560	We had to keep it on a separate network because PSN is actually still down, and we're just
865560	870040	put psychedelics into your breakfast cereal so that you'll believe it's back up.
870040	873600	No seriously, we had to work around the clock, because some dumbass put a giant clock in
873600	876920	our server room, and we had to work around that damn thing because we couldn't move it
876920	877920	out of the way.
877920	881680	By we had to work around the clock, I mean everybody except me, where I went home and
881680	883800	ate crayons.
883800	887840	I especially like the green one, because when I cough it up later on, it looks like mucus
887840	891280	and I can gross out my kids.
891280	900000	I don't know, it just reminded me of, like, one of those, like, it's really cheesy acting
900000	901000	or something.
901000	902000	I don't know.
902000	903000	I- Whatever.
903000	907560	He's reading off the teleprompter, because if you look where his eyes are fixated the
907560	910760	entire time, he's reading a teleprompter.
910760	913600	Or he's staring into your soul.
913600	915800	He can't, he has no soul.
915800	919160	Only people with souls can stare at other people with souls.
919160	922000	It's in the unwritten book of souls.
922000	928280	So anyways, yeah, PlayStation Network, the first phase, I guess leading up to the full
928280	933480	return by the end of May, included the following services, obviously the ability to sign into
933480	938920	the PlayStation Network and Curiosity, including resetting the passwords, restoration of online
938920	948520	gameplay, including PlayStation 3 and PSP, playback of rental video content, music unlimited
948520	955560	services from Curiosity, access to third party services such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and
955560	957120	MLB TV.
957120	959640	The friends category and PlayStation Home.
959640	962220	Yes, thank God PlayStation Home was part of that.
962220	968560	I missed it so much, because there's so much partying going on in PlayStation Home.
968560	978820	And then of course, it's fully back up throughout North America, which is awesome for us.
978820	983200	And I'm just running home right now to go sign up on the PlayStation Network to change
983200	989240	my password and play some games, oh wait it's not, because I don't care.
989240	993040	And then finally, Sony Online Entertainment announced that they're going to be offering
993040	998240	their members a free month, which is great since it's been down for a month, and they're
998240	1004800	rewarding their players for the affected downtime, I guess some double XP events for EverQuest
1004800	1012840	and Vanguard, and they're going to be doing some special gear in DC Universe and Star
1012840	1013840	Wars Galaxies.
1013840	1018640	I did see, well the DC Universe one, it's like some stupid cowl thing that looks like
1018640	1020560	you could be Batman or something.
1020560	1026880	And then Star Wars Galaxies, I'm surprised, I didn't even realize that was still up.
1026880	1029280	But hey, learned something.
1029280	1034480	And then finally, I guess lifetime subscribers will get another load in, or I guess some
1034480	1042240	more in-game currency, 500 station cash.
1042240	1044480	Whatever station cash is.
1044480	1047440	I'm sorry, what?
1047440	1049000	I'm sorry, you're right.
1049000	1052440	My brain shut off for that whole thing right there.
1052440	1057440	So here's what I have to say, now that everybody's relieved to be back online and playing, is
1057440	1058840	anyone still mad?
1058840	1062520	Because I have a feeling by next week no one's going to be mad anymore, they're just forgetting
1062520	1063520	about it.
1063520	1066120	Well- Love Steam, I don't care.
1066120	1068480	I don't know.
1068480	1074520	With E3 so close and around the corner too, I mean, this is still going to be fresh in
1074520	1078700	people's minds when E3 rolls around, and that's one of the disadvantages that Sony's going
1078700	1079700	into this with.
1079700	1084760	I mean, and you can say that the Red Ring of Death thing was a big debacle too, but
1084760	1089280	you know, remember, Microsoft kind of finally, it took them long enough, they kind of came
1089280	1093160	out and admitted fault for that, and they were generally able to get over that whole
1093160	1094160	thing.
1094160	1097800	Whereas, I don't know, this is still really fresh in people's minds, we're still going
1097800	1101080	to have lawsuits after this that have yet to be settled and so on.
1101080	1106180	This is not over today, I mean, PlayStation Network is still not 100% back up.
1106180	1110640	You can't buy games online right now, and if you're a developer, that kind of sucks.
1110640	1111640	You know what I mean?
1111640	1112640	Yeah.
1112640	1119880	Yeah, I don't know if you read one of the stories, well, there's some ridiculous stories,
1119880	1124960	you know, regarding this whole thing, but I mean, I don't know.
1124960	1129760	For me, it doesn't really matter, because I'm never on PlayStation Network, so it just
1129760	1136640	was an inconvenience because now I had to wait to activate my Steam copy of Portal 2.
1136640	1144200	Well, technically I didn't have to wait, but you know, it was such a non-event for me.
1144200	1146200	I was like, eh, whatever.
1146200	1147200	So I'm not on it.
1147200	1148400	I can't be on it.
1148400	1149400	Don't care.
1149400	1152240	Oh, actually, this is late breaking.
1152240	1157040	There's another video that was just released by Sony of Kazurai giving an update as to
1157040	1159480	what's going on on PlayStation Network.
1159480	1163280	Let's take a look and see what's going on in this latest announcement from Kazurai.
1163280	1164840	Bueller?
1164840	1166400	Bueller?
1166400	1167920	Bueller?
1167920	1169360	Bueller?
1169360	1170680	Bueller?
1170680	1178480	Oh, I guess the Bueller network will be coming back soon, I don't know.
1178480	1180680	All right, there you go.
1180680	1181680	Anyhow.
1181680	1185960	I have some more PlayStation updates and what's going on.
1185960	1191760	Actually, mentioning about developers being pissed off, apparently publishers and developers
1191760	1194560	obviously have been out quite a bit of money.
1194560	1197040	You know, that's three weeks of lost sales and then some.
1197040	1200440	Again, the story is not back up just yet.
1200440	1204800	Apparently, Sony was not telling the developers and publishers really anything.
1204800	1208320	They only had the same information that the rest of us had.
1208320	1212040	Sony finally sent out a letter to its publishing partners.
1212040	1217080	It was sent out three weeks after the PlayStation Network went down, which is interesting.
1217080	1218680	Here's a clip of the letter.
1218680	1223880	Dear partner, as you know, certain PlayStation Network curiosity is, which by the way is
1223880	1225880	how you pronounce it, not core-yorosity.
1225880	1226880	Curiosity?
1226880	1227880	Queue.
1227880	1228880	Curiosity.
1228880	1229880	Curiosity.
1229880	1233560	Well, I don't care.
1233560	1234760	Once again, I don't care.
1234760	1238440	Whoa, you're so clever for putting a queue there and making me try to figure out how
1238440	1240760	to pronounce a fucking thing.
1240760	1241760	Guess what?
1241760	1245800	It's a service I don't fucking care to use, so I don't care to fucking know how to pronounce
1245800	1246800	it either.
1246800	1250920	As you know, blah, blah, blah, account information was compromised, criminal attacks, blah, blah,
1250920	1251920	blah.
1251920	1254960	I want to assure you as a PlayStation partner that it is Sony's top priority to restore
1254960	1259120	our network operations and see that business is returned to usual as soon as possible.
1259120	1263040	We are working around the clock to restore service, but we'll do so only when we can
1263040	1267680	ensure that the network can operate safely and securely, blah, blah, blah.
1267680	1271320	And then they go over exactly what happened, which really is all the stuff that you would
1271320	1275960	have got just reading the internet and the various game blogs and what's going on.
1275960	1277160	Let's see.
1277160	1282600	As a valued partner, we aim to keep the lines of communication open so that you are aware
1282600	1284320	of our progress.
1284320	1289080	Our focus has been to confirm the security of the networks, protect customer data, and
1289080	1292080	get the services back online as quickly as possible.
1292080	1295560	We will do our best to respond to all of your inquiries and we will do everything we can
1295560	1296880	to possibly support you.
1296880	1300700	I mean, that is a load of crap if I've ever heard it.
1300700	1303000	We aim to keep the lines of communication open.
1303000	1308560	So that's why you're regurgitating what every news outlet has been saying for the past three
1308560	1309560	weeks.
1309560	1310560	That sucks.
1310560	1315960	If I was a PlayStation Network developer, I would be so mad about this.
1315960	1319120	Why weren't you upfront with us sooner?
1319120	1323440	And it's really going to give me pause in developing a PlayStation Network exclusive.
1323440	1329060	Sony is really going to have to, you know, as their game plan to get up and going again,
1329060	1332980	they're really going to have to shell out money for exclusive agreements.
1332980	1336240	It's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.
1336240	1340800	Anyhow, some other stuff with the whole PlayStation breach.
1340800	1345440	There's a rumor going around that a rented Amazon server was actually used to launch
1345440	1350520	the attack, which is interesting because Amazon was having all their issues, you know, and
1350520	1355360	the web service, not the, not the same portion of Amazon that sells the books and CDs.
1355360	1359720	We have to remember Amazon is a very large service and they also sell like web hosting
1359720	1360720	as part of their service.
1360720	1364200	And you might remember that a bunch of sites they hosted went down, which was a big deal
1364200	1368000	for Amazon because they have like, you know, service level agreements that were being broken
1368000	1369000	and so forth.
1369000	1374160	Well, according to Bloomberg News, they are saying that the hackers who actually hacked
1374160	1378760	PlayStation Network rented a server from Amazon.com to do so, signing up for the service using
1378760	1380240	fake information.
1380240	1381800	Hmm.
1381800	1382800	Interesting theory.
1382800	1389800	But, you know, pardon my ignorance, but how would this server be used to hack PlayStation
1389800	1390800	Network?
1390800	1394160	I mean, a DDoS is one thing, but that's not what we're talking about happened here.
1394160	1396120	This is not a simple DDoS.
1396120	1399200	Somebody got in there and the information got exposed.
1399200	1404320	So how does that work using a cloud, uh, the cloud computer?
1404320	1406760	I mean, I just don't know enough about hacking Loki.
1406760	1407760	Any ideas?
1407760	1412000	Well, if they're brute forcing something, the more computers they have working on it,
1412000	1414000	the faster it goes.
1414000	1415000	Hmm.
1415000	1418100	Well, you can, it can be guaranteed that if this is true, you can see a subpoena will
1418100	1421880	be going to out to Amazon very soon to try and figure out, you know, whose credit card
1421880	1426960	was used to sign up, which if that ends up being true, that was, um, it was kind of dumb
1426960	1430840	the hackers to do, but they probably used a fake or stolen credit card.
1430840	1431840	Yeah, I'm sure.
1431840	1435800	Oh, we'll put all the real, you know, we'll put fake names, but the credit card, we'll
1435800	1440680	put a real credit card or a real credit card name or something like that.
1440680	1441680	Hmm.
1441680	1449920	Uh, also one other quick thing, uh, about, um, this whole thing, uh, retailers are saying
1449920	1454400	that PlayStation three owners are just ditching the platform altogether and migrating to the
1454400	1455400	360.
1455400	1457800	This is gonna be ironic, hold on, just real quick.
1457800	1462240	You know, uh, one of the stories that came out before they were saying that there was
1462240	1467240	people that were hacking the PlayStation three using the, um, you know, the, it's a new custom
1467240	1471900	firmware called re, was it a re-bug or something like that.
1471900	1475800	And basically it gave them access to like the developer side of things where you can
1475800	1482100	buy PlayStation content using this, uh, credit card number that they had or whatever that
1482100	1487080	was associated with the developer stuff that allowed them to add, you know, funds to their
1487080	1489600	account and buy stuff without actually spending real money.
1489600	1490600	Oh yeah.
1490600	1493040	Wouldn't it be ironic if they use that credit card number?
1493040	1496160	That would be hilarious.
1496160	1502000	Uh, apparently a lot of people were canceling their pre-orders for brink, uh, for the PlayStation
1502000	1503000	three.
1503000	1506520	Uh, lots of stuff going on in the used market, which I think dark soccer is going to get
1506520	1511800	into in a minute here, but, uh, yeah, lots of PlayStation threes being traded in.
1511800	1516160	People going to Xbox three 60 again, this is just from a source in Belgium.
1516160	1523180	Uh, you know, I'm sure, I'm sure there's an increase over normal, but I'm not sure if
1523180	1527280	it's a, Oh shit, PlayStation is damned a situation yet.
1527280	1531400	I mean people, I mean, if you're that fickle that you're going to just, you know, dump
1531400	1535720	your system because the networks down for a couple of weeks, then whatever, then you're
1535720	1539900	going to be, then you're going to be fickle enough to, you know, buy the system again
1539900	1543240	later on when there's something that you want to play on it, cause that's, what's going
1543240	1544240	to end up happening.
1544240	1548400	I mean, live goes down every once in a while for a day and stuff.
1548400	1551720	You don't see people like running on mass, you know, selling their console.
1551720	1555480	To be fair, it doesn't go down because somebody stole my credit card information.
1555480	1558000	It's never been down for 22 days.
1558000	1559000	True.
1559000	1564640	You know, there is a big difference than that, but I just think, you know, I do think selling
1564640	1570080	your PlayStation on this alone might be a little bit throwing out the baby with the
1570080	1571760	bathwater a little bit.
1571760	1576440	I mean, I, I, there could be that exclusive that comes out that makes you kind of want
1576440	1577720	to come back sorta.
1577720	1583400	I mean, if you, if you sell this and you mean it, then Hey, everybody has that right to
1583400	1588360	make those types of choices, but I just, I know too many people that sell systems only
1588360	1593560	to buy them back when the game they really want comes out, kind of like the 3DS, like
1593560	1597720	if you're selling a 3DS back already, you really should question why you bought one
1597720	1598720	in the first place.
1598720	1601800	I mean, that's really the underlying problem right now.
1601800	1607040	I mean, everybody knows the 3DS lineup right now is weak at best.
1607040	1611680	So, but there's going to be much better 3DS games by the end of the year between the Kid
1611680	1615320	Icarus, the assumed Mario game that's going to be announced at E3 and so forth.
1615320	1616800	There'll be more reasons to have it.
1616800	1620360	So why sell back a 3DS now just to buy one six months later?
1620360	1624120	So, but there are people, I mean, and there are going to be a certain percentage of people
1624120	1626160	that just feel so violated by this whole thing.
1626160	1632000	They've sworn off Sony and this could damage the PlayStation 4 later on.
1632000	1633000	But I don't know.
1633000	1636240	I think it's a bit too early to really see the full ramifications.
1636240	1640000	I think it is so important more than ever this year to really see what Sony's bringing
1640000	1642280	out the big guns this year at E3.
1642280	1647680	But you know, I'm not exactly loving the fact that Sony's PlayStation network was down for
1647680	1650840	22 days, that my credit card information was stolen.
1650840	1655320	But at the same token, I kind of keep going back and forth on that crap, too.
1655320	1659560	They're like, oh, well, we have no evidence that it actually was stolen.
1659560	1664560	Oh, well, but you still want to, you know, be sure and take all these safety precautions.
1664560	1667860	Oh, but we have really no evidence that's been stolen.
1667860	1669280	They're going back and forth on it.
1669280	1673840	Just like say, listen, it's been compromised and be done with it.
1673840	1678640	People will say, well, you know, there's really no evidence that they looked at it.
1678640	1679640	You know, they have the data.
1679640	1680640	They stole all of it.
1680640	1681640	Who knows?
1681640	1684640	They maybe just deleted the file and said, pat themselves on the back and say, good job
1684640	1685640	me.
1685640	1686640	I hacked Sony.
1686640	1693600	So, um, I just, it's going to be interesting because later on this year you still have
1693600	1697320	some big, you know, The Last Guardian is a game that a lot of people are foaming at the
1697320	1698320	mouth over.
1698320	1703640	So it's very, it's going to be like, you know, will people forgive us if the games are good
1703640	1704640	enough?
1704640	1708040	It's going to be very, very interesting these next few months.
1708040	1710360	So anyhow, let's move on.
1710360	1713880	I think Dark Sakura has a little more to add to this whole retail angle.
1713880	1722160	Well, actually there is a notice that at least in the U S that, uh, diff 10 of the most popular
1722160	1729520	online titles that were for PlayStation three dropped by an average of 7.4%, um, basically
1729520	1731720	since the 20th of April.
1731720	1738560	And then the same 10 titles saw a 0.7% increase on Xbox three 60 for sales.
1738560	1744600	Also, um, uh, one of the UK retailers was reporting that they had double the amount
1744600	1751160	of PS threes being brought in and then half of those people picking up an Xbox three 60
1751160	1758240	that also sales of, uh, use titles have just completely been borked by PS three going to
1758240	1764520	sell like two coming in at four.
1764520	1765520	It's all fuzzy map.
1765520	1774400	It sounds like, well, at any rate, I, most people really are that fickle and it's, it's
1774400	1779560	really people in general I think are just so fickle that they're going to not put up
1779560	1784560	with any type of inconvenience when high real life doesn't always work out for you.
1784560	1786920	You're going to have to wait.
1786920	1788080	I didn't care.
1788080	1790880	Let's go to the chat room at chat dot orange lunch radio dot com for some feedback going
1790880	1791880	on right now.
1791880	1795360	A game guru in our chat room says red ring of death and PlayStation network being hacked
1795360	1800060	are only comparable in terms of showing the deficiencies that Microsoft and Sony has.
1800060	1801060	Kind of interesting.
1801060	1805880	Yes, because Microsoft was always a software company and then they were getting into hardware.
1805880	1809880	But you know, in Microsoft though, I think that their response was a little bit better
1809880	1810880	than Sony's.
1810880	1816360	I mean, at least I granted they, I don't think they ever really admitted how many are affected.
1816360	1819400	Trust me, it's more than the 1% that they were quoting.
1819400	1825440	It's every single one, every single, every single one launch, every single one will be
1825440	1828000	absolutely be affected.
1828000	1832880	If you have one that's from the launch, you know, 2005 or whatever, and it's still working
1832880	1835520	today, that's a fluke.
1835520	1836520	Trust me.
1836520	1841720	I, I know every single one will die a salacious pop responding to something you just said
1841720	1842760	a little bit ago.
1842760	1847240	I think Loki is under recognizing the huge dude broke contingent who only play black
1847240	1849800	ops battlefield, modern warfare all day.
1849800	1851240	And that's all they play.
1851240	1853680	And they're Sony geeks and never got into halo.
1853680	1856760	Or I would add to that that the Blu-ray player was enticing.
1856760	1861760	I mean, like it or not, the Blu-ray factor being in the PlayStation three is still selling
1861760	1866560	a lot of those over Xbox three six to the dude broke contingent that salacious pop brings
1866560	1867560	up.
1867560	1870000	Not the audience that would be listening to this show, but the people that are like, Oh,
1870000	1872840	this thing plays Blu-rays and it plays modern warfare.
1872840	1873840	Cool.
1873840	1880480	You know, well, first of all, your Blu-ray player will still work and it's back up.
1880480	1881800	So what's the problem?
1881800	1886580	Oh, those people that it took my credit card info.
1886580	1889080	So you gave them your credit card info.
1889080	1893960	Well, on top of that, just call the bank and change your shit.
1893960	1896800	You know, a little inconvenience for your own security.
1896800	1897800	Sorry.
1897800	1898800	You're going to have to deal with it.
1898800	1902800	You're going to end up, uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says, I don't know, call me crazy, but
1902800	1906460	I'd rather have my three 60 red ring of death than my private information stolen.
1906460	1907460	That's just me.
1907460	1910320	If you say it's the same, then you obviously don't know what it's like to have your credit
1910320	1912040	card or identity stolen.
1912040	1918240	Uh, I still don't give a shit because if somebody tries to use my number, guess what?
1918240	1922320	We'll call and cancel the card and then they'll trace it back to whoever did it.
1922320	1923760	Don't care.
1923760	1924760	Really don't care.
1924760	1928120	Well, it's going to be, I mean, if that happens, you're going to care when it happens.
1928120	1931800	If it happens at a bad time, but it's not gonna affect my credit.
1931800	1934540	It's not going to affect my finances.
1934540	1935540	It will.
1935540	1940580	All the funds will be frozen and I'll get a new card and hopefully they'll catch whoever
1940580	1941580	did it.
1941580	1942580	Other than that.
1942580	1943580	Don't give a shit.
1943580	1944580	Yeah.
1944580	1945580	And I said this a couple of weeks before on the show.
1945580	1948860	If somebody were to use this credit card information has been stolen, you're really an idiot and
1948860	1953560	you're just asking to, uh, get caught for this whole thing.
1953560	1958040	I mean, the FBI is on this now, you know, they're just waiting for someone to fuck this
1958040	1961420	up and give away how this all, you know, kind of happened.
1961420	1968200	So and also the amount of information they actually got, um, you know, it's going to
1968200	1971120	take them forever to parse through that stuff anyways.
1971120	1976460	So yeah, there is a, there is the risks that your identity might be stolen or something
1976460	1982600	like that, but it's, I think it's very unlikely even even still, I think they'll catch them
1982600	1988640	before they even come close to parsing through all the data that's on there.
1988640	1990640	I agree with this comment in our chat room.
1990640	1994080	Defective candy at chat, that orange sounds radio.com says, if someone tries to use my
1994080	1996460	credit card, guess what sucks to be them.
1996460	1997460	I'm broke.
1997460	2007440	I was just thinking that, you know, I really, I really, okay, wasting time freaking out
2007440	2010520	over this is really exactly just that.
2010520	2012320	Wasting time.
2012320	2015640	All you're doing is working yourself up.
2015640	2019500	You selling your PlayStation three is going to mean you're not going to be able to play
2019500	2020500	whatever that is.
2020500	2023960	It's going to come out later and then you're going to have to spend more money to get another
2023960	2026280	one if you want to play it badly enough.
2026280	2031360	So in the end, lacking patience just makes you a loser.
2031360	2032360	That's it.
2032360	2037320	Well, but I, at the same time, I can understand where somebody is going to sell their PlayStation
2037320	2038320	three back over this.
2038320	2039320	I really do.
2039320	2044600	But I just would say, think ahead cause you don't want to do something reactive only to
2044600	2048240	get sweetened back by Sony later on.
2048240	2053000	We also still don't know what they plan to do to kind of wrong the right or excuse me,
2053000	2054000	right?
2054000	2055000	Wrong.
2055000	2056000	The right, right?
2056000	2057000	The wrong.
2057000	2058600	And uh, you know what they're going to give as part of this, I guess you could see severance
2058600	2060760	package or whatever to kind of come back to the place.
2060760	2061760	Wait, wait, wait.
2061760	2062760	You don't know.
2062760	2065960	Didn't you see the party look in Kaz's eyes?
2065960	2069200	It's obvious that he's going to throw one hell of a party.
2069200	2072160	That guy is a party animal.
2072160	2077080	And again, I, all I know, if I was thinking of selling my PlayStation three back, I'd
2077080	2080720	kind of be waiting until after E3 to make sure I really want to do it.
2080720	2085720	I'm not selling my fucking PS3 back because it's a fully backwards compatible PS3 with
2085720	2090360	the 500 gig hard drive in it that I don't play on the PlayStation network and hardly
2090360	2091480	ever buy games for.
2091480	2094540	So you know, I'm content with it.
2094540	2096040	I use it for Blu-rays.
2096040	2097040	Great.
2097040	2098040	You know what?
2098040	2102000	If there's a Sony game that really is awesome that I have to have, I can get it.
2102000	2104720	But for everything else that's multi-platform, you better believe it.
2104720	2109320	I'm getting in on the Xbox 360 because that's just what I play more.
2109320	2110640	It's more convenient for me.
2110640	2113040	PS3 sucked up to the front TV.
2113040	2116160	Nelly wants to play Animal Crossing still.
2116160	2119440	So, you know, all right.
2119440	2123360	I feel like it's been PlayStation network all the time for the past three weeks.
2123360	2126060	Believe it or not, there is news in other parts of the gaming world and I think it's
2126060	2127400	time we took a trip there.
2127400	2128400	How about Xbox?
2128400	2131200	Let's talk about something going on in the 360 world, Loki.
2131200	2135860	Well, remember they were beta testing an update that's gonna change kind of the disk format
2135860	2136860	a little bit.
2136860	2144560	They're gonna allow developers to use another gigabyte of space that was dedicated for like
2144560	2147640	a video partition that basically says Xbox.
2147640	2152700	It's a little swirl logo thing that lets you know, hey, dumbass, that's not a DVD movie.
2152700	2154240	It is an Xbox game.
2154240	2155340	But you know what?
2155340	2160560	I think most people can figure out that it's an Xbox game.
2160560	2163200	They don't need a little video that shows that.
2163200	2167000	So get that out of the way and you have more space for storing stuff.
2167000	2174400	So along with that, there's also gonna be, you know, some other updates including PayPal.
2174400	2177240	It's coming on May 19th, which is interesting.
2177240	2183280	You'll be able to use your PayPal account to add funds for buying an Xbox Live Marketplace
2183280	2184840	materials and whatnot.
2184840	2189360	Extremely interesting in light of everything that's going on at Sony, that you can kind
2189360	2191800	of use a middleman now.
2191800	2196240	Instead of having to give your information directly to Microsoft, you could use a, for
2196240	2201380	better or worse, trusted payment delivery source, although I don't know if giving your
2201380	2205080	info to PayPal is any better or worse than giving it to Microsoft, to be honest.
2205080	2208400	And then Avatar Connect, that's coming May 27th.
2208400	2213220	That's the, you know, program that you can chat with your friends and, you know, use
2213220	2217440	the connect to move your avatar around, kind of like a talk show almost.
2217440	2222360	This sounds kind of weird to me because don't they have a video chat program as it is right
2222360	2223360	now?
2223360	2225440	They do, but you can't wave around as your avatar.
2225440	2226440	Okay.
2226440	2230000	So this is for people who don't want to be seen as themselves.
2230000	2233000	They want to be seen as their avatar online in chat.
2233000	2234000	Yes.
2234000	2239100	So this is for like pedophiles and ugly people like, no, I mean, no offense to the ugly people
2239100	2240960	out there, but like, right?
2240960	2243480	Like why would you just use video chat?
2243480	2244480	Yeah.
2244480	2250080	Um, and then of course, you know, as I mentioned, uh, the, uh, XGD3, uh, that's the new format
2250080	2252120	that's going to be for the disks.
2252120	2255480	The other thing is, of course, they're going to be adding some more copy protection.
2255480	2259320	It's also going to be flashing all of those people that have flash modded drives.
2259320	2264480	It's going to be flashing those drives back to their stock firmwares and going to be,
2264480	2268280	um, fixing it in a way where you can't change it.
2268280	2270560	Well, you can't easily change it.
2270560	2276240	We'll get to that a little bit later, but a neat, you know, that also saves me a step
2276240	2281880	because I have one flash system still that we, it was leftover from, I just didn't want
2281880	2286160	to bother the flash it back and now I don't have to, they're going to do it for me.
2286160	2287160	Awesome.
2287160	2291880	I, what do you think about this news of what's coming out in the Xbox three spring update?
2291880	2294000	I mean, usually these updates are pretty exciting.
2294000	2296640	There's at least one little tidbit in there where you're like, Oh, that's going to be
2296640	2300200	awesome to have like the, I don't know, like the USB storage or whatever, but this time
2300200	2305720	around I'm looking at the updates going, eh, none of this, I mean, PayPal, okay.
2305720	2308040	I don't know who would use that, but not me.
2308040	2309440	Uh, I'd use it.
2309440	2315000	I mean, if I was buying a lot of content on Xbox live, I'd use it because I sell a lot
2315000	2316000	of shit on eBay.
2316000	2321040	So I have, I usually, when I'm not dumping my funds back into my bank account, I usually
2321040	2322680	have quite a bit sitting in my PayPal account.
2322680	2323680	I guess I can get that.
2323680	2325460	See, I don't, I don't really use PayPal like that.
2325460	2327880	Like I use PayPal to pay for Skype and that's about it.
2327880	2331720	And that's cause I, we've been using Skype ever since they were like a company based
2331720	2336160	in the UK and it was actually very easy to do the international funds through PayPal.
2336160	2338360	Um, so that's why I have a PayPal account.
2338360	2339360	I don't use it for anything.
2339360	2342200	I also use, I use it a lot for just buying stuff online.
2342200	2343520	I buy a lot of stuff on eBay.
2343520	2346320	I buy a lot of stuff like subscriptions for things.
2346320	2348960	I'll pay for that.
2348960	2353000	That makes sense though, that for those people that actually use PayPal as a wallet from
2353000	2357360	like eBay and things like that, that is kind of a neat way to be able to pay for the games.
2357360	2360440	It's online for eBay and Dan uses it for his RC cars.
2360440	2361440	All right, I get it.
2361440	2363840	I guess that is a little bit more exciting, but I don't know.
2363840	2364840	But once again.
2364840	2365840	Let's talk about me again.
2365840	2366840	I am not excited.
2366840	2367840	There's nothing in it for me.
2367840	2368840	Yeah.
2368840	2373240	See, I don't buy a lot of download content anymore for games other than like maybe like
2373240	2374960	a Grand Theft Auto or something like that.
2374960	2380500	I probably wouldn't buy, you know, download content for a lot of things.
2380500	2384360	I may or may not have bought Dan Central songs the other day.
2384360	2399760	You know, I have certain hardware configurations in various places that facilitate the ability
2399760	2405720	to not have to purchase that stuff and yet enjoy the full range of content.
2405720	2409680	I think that's the place where I can say that.
2409680	2411280	But yeah, I really don't buy a lot.
2411280	2414640	Mainly because, you know, look at what I'm playing each week, Grand Theft Auto, Grand
2414640	2415640	Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto.
2415640	2418760	I mean, there's not any new content coming out for that, so there's nothing for me to
2418760	2419760	buy.
2419760	2420760	DJ Hero.
2420760	2421760	You know, Grand Theft Auto 5.
2421760	2422760	You know, 1.5.
2422760	2423760	Yeah.
2423760	2424760	Hell yeah.
2424760	2425760	1.5.
2425760	2426760	Anything they put out, I'll buy.
2426760	2430360	I mean, that's just, you know, the way it is.
2430360	2432080	All right.
2432080	2436560	Let me move on to a story about something that maybe you'll be using your PayPal money
2436560	2437560	to download.
2437560	2438560	I don't know.
2438560	2444360	Sega has been an ESRB rating that's come out for the Genesis game Monster World 4 coming
2444360	2447200	out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
2447200	2449840	Now, that kind of spilled the news a little early.
2449840	2455520	Sega of Europe actually confirmed that they are bringing the game over to PlayStation
2455520	2457640	Network and Wii Virtual Console.
2457640	2460860	So odd that they left Xbox Live Arcade out of that, but whatever.
2460860	2462640	Maybe something's happening in the future.
2462640	2464800	I don't know.
2464800	2468000	There's gonna be a vintage collection that actually comes out later in the year.
2468000	2471960	You know, they've been milking those Genesis games for all their worth and there's still
2471960	2474680	people that will pay five bucks a game for it, so whatever.
2474680	2479040	This collection is gonna have Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Revenge of Shinobi, Alex Kidd
2479040	2482200	in Miracle World, Wonder Boy in Monster World.
2482200	2487480	Now, all those games have already come out on the Virtual Console here in North America.
2487480	2492800	But the interesting thing about this, Monster World 4, it was never actually officially
2492800	2495920	released on a console outside of Japan.
2495920	2497080	And get this.
2497080	2500020	It's gonna be localized as a part of this collection.
2500020	2507320	So Sega is actually localizing this ages-old, what is this, 94, I think, game?
2507320	2508320	Wasn't this first game?
2508320	2509320	Don't say that, Rob.
2509320	2510320	It was, uh, sorry.
2510320	2511680	That's when I graduated.
2511680	2512680	I don't write the news.
2512680	2513680	I just report it.
2513680	2517400	As, uh, trolls would say on the internet, Sega does but intend don't.
2517400	2523120	In other words, localizing an old game that maybe fans might want to play just because
2523120	2524120	they can.
2524120	2525120	That's the best zing I've heard on a show.
2525120	2526120	Hey, Joe Aniki came out.
2526120	2527120	Don't say that.
2527120	2528120	What's that?
2528120	2529120	Joe Aniki came out.
2529120	2530120	But that's not a Nintendo game.
2530120	2531120	They didn't translate it.
2531120	2532120	Yeah, it wasn't Nintendo.
2532120	2535280	They didn't, yeah, when Sin and Punishment, the original came out, they didn't bother
2535280	2536280	to translate it.
2536280	2539800	I mean, a lot of those games didn't need translation, but this is really the first time that they've
2539800	2541840	gone back and actually are gonna translate a game.
2541840	2547480	Now, I can't imagine Monster World 4 has the epic dialogue of a role-playing game, but
2547480	2551040	it's probably got, what, it's kind of a Mario-y style game, right?
2551040	2553460	Sort of a side-scrolling adventure game, right?
2553460	2555560	So it's probably got a decent amount of dialogue.
2555560	2558720	It's kind of neat that they're localizing it.
2558720	2561920	But at the same time, if I have to buy this whole big collection with all these other
2561920	2564040	Genesis games just to get it, I don't know.
2564040	2569240	And I gotta be honest, well, I don't know, I hear Monster World 4 is really, really good
2569240	2575080	and I'm missing a lot by not playing it, but my desire to go and pay money for this old
2575080	2579000	94 game, I don't know, I just, I'm not, like, super excited about it.
2579000	2582760	I just think there's other stuff in the gaming world my money would be spent on.
2582760	2584440	But I guess I'll wait and see when this comes out.
2584440	2587640	Maybe everybody will be like, you have to play it, it's great, and we were missing so
2587640	2588720	much before.
2588720	2591880	A good game is still a good game at the end of the day, right?
2591880	2592880	So.
2592880	2593880	Alright, moving on.
2593880	2595660	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?
2595660	2600760	I have other news related to Disney, although I, okay, this is, I'm first gonna point out
2600760	2604880	something that I totally loathe that this article does.
2604880	2609840	Okay, the article says, Disney Studio coughs up 3 million for violating kiddie gamer's
2609840	2611320	privacy.
2611320	2612520	But Disney didn't do it.
2612520	2619120	It was titles that had been acquired before Disney acquired Playdom, which is their online
2619120	2620760	kids gaming thing.
2620760	2625840	So to say Disney did it, yeah, Disney may have accepted all the liability, but it wasn't
2625840	2629280	Disney that did it, and I hate when titles are misleading like that, so.
2629280	2637280	But at any rate, Playdom, which is the Disney social game studios, paid 3 million dollars
2637280	2643300	as a settlement for titles that were there before Playdom acquired, I'm sorry, that were
2643300	2649440	acquired by Playdom before Disney acquired it, were collecting kids' ages and email addresses
2649440	2652080	without parental consent.
2652080	2654740	It was posted without parental consent.
2654740	2656740	So Disney coughed up the cash for it.
2656740	2659440	And isn't, there is some type of law where like if you're under 13.
2659440	2660440	It's COPA.
2660440	2661440	Yeah.
2661440	2662440	Yeah.
2662440	2667480	So basically, um, you know, they have to have consent to be able to do something like that,
2667480	2671400	and it was a game called Pony Stars, which was like a My Little Pony game.
2671400	2674800	Oh shit, my information probably got compromised.
2674800	2676200	Oh Rob.
2676200	2680120	But basically, these were all done by Acclaim.
2680120	2682440	At the time, it was under Acclaim's management.
2682440	2684880	Uh, the Curse of Acclaim.
2684880	2686000	Yeah.
2686000	2688800	And then Playdom bought out Acclaim.
2688800	2689800	So.
2689800	2696600	But actually, the former Acclaim CEO, Howard Marks, is also being named in the case.
2696600	2697600	Oh snap.
2697600	2705160	So I would say, uh, you know, whoever holds whatever rights are left, you know, Disney
2705160	2707240	needs to go after them.
2707240	2711480	Um, it's really tricky, especially when you're talking about games marketed towards kids.
2711480	2715460	Like a lot of kids, you know what game comes to mind for me is that Smurfs Village game
2715460	2719760	on iOS has taken a lot of heat and that's a Capcom game, if I'm not mistaken.
2719760	2724000	The Smurfs Village game, because of how easy it is for kids to get sucked into that game
2724000	2728000	and buy the little Smurf Berries, like, you know, it's just touch, touch, touch to do
2728000	2729000	it.
2729000	2732280	And you buy those, like you've heard these stories of kids spending hundreds of dollars
2732280	2736740	on these dumb ass Smurf Berries to make things grow faster in the game, but you know, a lot
2736740	2742880	of 10 year olds who don't have a true concept of money don't understand that.
2742880	2743880	I think back to when-
2743880	2748160	And parents that don't have a concept of parenting don't understand that their kids are buying
2748160	2753240	stuff through their phone.
2753240	2757520	I think it's funny though, cause I think back to a time when I was probably like 14 or 15
2757520	2762160	and I was on Prodigy and Prodigy used to charge for using chat rooms and one month I ran up
2762160	2766280	like a $90 bill in the chat room or something like that and my mother, oh God, I never heard
2766280	2767280	the end of it.
2767280	2769280	You guys never heard the end of it.
2769280	2772800	Yeah, we did the same thing in Prodigy, but it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily because of
2772800	2775800	the, um, the chat room.
2775800	2781080	It was because, um, the number that it picked to dial was long distance.
2781080	2782080	No.
2782080	2783080	Yeah.
2783080	2785080	That's not good.
2785080	2786080	Love dialing.
2786080	2792600	See, I used to have the hookup on AOL back in the day because I dialed in on an 800 number.
2792600	2794080	I thought you had to pay for that.
2794080	2795080	And had a free account.
2795080	2796840	I was gonna say, I thought you had to pay for the 800 number.
2796840	2799680	I was a chat room host for Cartoon Network.
2799680	2803540	It was almost impossible not to have a free account through AOL because you'd threaten
2803540	2810240	to cancel or, you know, they'd just send you another 72, you know, day trial or whatever.
2810240	2814240	Just a ridiculous amount of 720 hour trial.
2814240	2818080	That's what it was, you know, oh, wait, that's 30 days.
2818080	2819080	Awesome.
2819080	2827700	Uh, yeah, but I'm referring to back when it was like $3 an hour or something.
2827700	2830480	Back when it had just gotten out of DOS.
2830480	2834560	Rama in the chat room says, Sky, if she didn't beat you with the belt, you got off lucky.
2834560	2835560	LOL.
2835560	2836560	No.
2836560	2838880	All the abuse in my household was always emotional, never physical.
2838880	2839880	Alright.
2839880	2842740	That's not abuse.
2842740	2844520	Let's move on.
2844520	2850720	Let's move on and talk about release dates and what's coming out to a store near you
2850720	2851800	depending on where you live.
2851800	2853480	We'll start with the US.
2853480	2854480	Not much this week.
2854480	2859200	LA Noire on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 being the biggest title of the week.
2859200	2860920	It's kind of a big title, right?
2860920	2862320	Yeah, just a little bit.
2862320	2867960	The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings on PC, coming out from Atari.
2867960	2871560	The First Templar on Xbox 360.
2871560	2877040	Spongebob Squigglepants for the 3DS, this is the game that's sort of like Warioware,
2877040	2880620	but here it's terrible, so, you know, keep that in mind.
2880620	2883240	Another terrible title for the 3DS.
2883240	2884240	Cake Man-
2884240	2885240	What a shock!
2885240	2886240	Yeah, shocker.
2886240	2890960	Cake Mania Main Street for the Nintendo DS, I'm sure it's all like the other Cake Mania
2890960	2891960	games.
2891960	2897440	Fable 3 on PC this week.
2897440	2898440	And that's it.
2898440	2901140	Alright, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there.
2901140	2905960	You get your version of Portal 2 this week on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, those
2905960	2908060	coming out on May the 19th.
2908060	2911160	And yeah, those are like localized versions for Japan.
2911160	2916200	I don't know if they have all new voice actors or if it uses subtitles or what, but yeah,
2916200	2919400	they're getting their own version of Portal 2 so they can get in on the fun that we're
2919400	2920400	having over here.
2920400	2923460	Again, that's on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
2923460	2926200	Also coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week, excuse me, is a price reduction, not
2926200	2930560	a new game, but FIFA Soccer 11 moves into the best hit series from EA, it's like it's
2930560	2933360	a big price reduction in Japan this week.
2933360	2938400	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nuttin' this week, what a surprise, the Nintendo 3DS Dead
2938400	2942140	or Alive Dimensions finally gets its release this week in Japan, so I'm sure we'll be hearing
2942140	2947460	some reports on that game and how it turned out, because we'll be getting it soon enough.
2947460	2954560	Also on the 3DS over there, Animal Resort, Dobutsen o Suikuro comes out, and Tom Clancy's
2954560	2957120	Ghost Recon Shadow Wars also comes out.
2957120	2960480	Trying to look at this Animal Resort, and honestly, when I see the box, the first thing
2960480	2964580	I think of, honest, Africa.
2964580	2966120	Because it looks just like that game.
2966120	2968240	Who's putting out Animal Resort?
2968240	2973280	Animal Resort is being put out by, who is this, AQ Interactive is putting out the game,
2973280	2977920	but look at this, there's elephants you can take pictures of, and hippopotamus, it looks
2977920	2981200	like you feed them, because there's little items there on the bottom, and it looks like
2981200	2986520	this guy is dragging a type of fruit to feed the hippopotamus, but this is adorable, there's
2986520	2989680	apparently penguins in this, so now I kind of want it, to be honest.
2989680	2994680	Looks pretty good, I mean, for a 3DS title, the graphics are pretty good.
2994680	3001200	It's kind of an interesting twist on Nintendogs, I bet what this is, is it's kind of like Nintendzoo.
3001200	3003400	Maybe it's like Animonsnap.
3003400	3008600	Well I was just wondering if, the only reason I asked who made it, is because there's a
3008600	3013840	title coming from Ubisoft called Zoo Mania that looks similar to that, and I'm wondering
3013840	3016320	if it's actually the exact same game.
3016320	3018160	Perhaps, we'll have to look that up.
3018160	3022900	On the Sony PSP this week on May the 19th, Akiba's Trip comes out.
3022900	3027560	This is, uh, oh what do they do, it's a trip.
3027560	3030040	It's a game where you get people to strip.
3030040	3032840	No you don't get people to strip, I don't, what?
3032840	3038340	Yes, you, by fighting them, they will remove, their clothes will be removed.
3038340	3039840	I'm serious, there's an article about it.
3039840	3042880	Oh my god, that is what's really happening in this picture, it looks like she's wearing
3042880	3044440	cat ears and no pants.
3044440	3049200	Now, not completely naked because, you know, it's a PSP title, but yes, that's exactly
3049200	3050200	what happens.
3050200	3052280	They do have porn titles for PSP.
3052280	3056440	Yeah, but those are video titles, they're not actual game titles.
3056440	3057440	Well.
3057440	3059960	No, there's games.
3059960	3062680	They do not have fully-nude games on the PSP.
3062680	3065600	Trust me, I've looked.
3065600	3066840	The wife really wants one.
3066840	3070000	Well no, they sell them on J-list.
3070000	3076920	They're x-rated UMDs, that's what those are, but they don't have actual PSP games.
3076920	3081120	I mean, come on, this is Japan we're talking about, they're very conservative when it comes
3081120	3083480	to video games.
3083480	3084480	Uh-huh.
3084480	3089000	Alright, and then there's a few games that move into best hits on the PSP as well, including
3089000	3093560	FIFA Soccer 11 and Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos, but that does it for your Japanese releases.
3093560	3096560	Let's go to the UK.
3096560	3097560	In the UK.
3097560	3100000	Actually, as soon as I voice somebody in our chat room.
3100000	3105600	Okay, in the UK we have on the 17th Fallout New Vegas, Honest Hearts, and The Witcher
3105600	3112440	2, Assassins of Kings for PC, and a new beginning on the 20th, Dead or Alive Dimensions and
3112440	3115240	L.A. Noire.
3115240	3116240	And that's it.
3116240	3117240	Alright.
3117240	3120700	Couple news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
3120700	3122080	What will it be this week?
3122080	3123860	We'll find out in two more stories.
3123860	3127800	So Microsoft had some money to spend and, you know, what did they decide to do?
3127800	3129120	They bought Skype.
3129120	3136640	So they bought Skype for $8.5 billion, and apparently they're gonna be, um, you know,
3136640	3141920	Skype will be supported on Microsoft devices like the Xbox and Kinect, Windows Phone, and
3141920	3146800	an array of other Windows devices, and also, of course, they announced that, um, you know,
3146800	3152320	they'll still be supporting, you know, the platforms that it's on already, so, um, you
3152320	3154880	know, the PSP and whatnot.
3154880	3159880	And I guess this is also Skype users with Link, Outlook, and Xbox Live and other communities
3159880	3168400	will be able to connect with Skype as well, so that's kind of neat.
3168400	3174080	So I'm wondering now if we're gonna see, like, Windows with Skype, you know, built in as,
3174080	3178680	you know, like a default program and stuff like that, or, you know, why this thing is
3178680	3180480	kind of neat that they're gonna have Skype.
3180480	3185000	I wonder if they're gonna do, like, the Avatar Kinect with Skype.
3185000	3186000	Maybe.
3186000	3187920	Certainly this is gonna be coming to the 360 sooner rather than later.
3187920	3192000	I'm kind of surprised this isn't being rushed for the spring update, uh, because that's
3192000	3193000	a pretty big addition.
3193000	3196680	Like, I understand that, I guess right now, the Kinect video chat will work with Windows
3196680	3204680	Messenger, but I don't know anyone that uses Windows Messenger that's not also on an Xbox,
3204680	3206060	so I don't know.
3206060	3209840	But you know the interesting thing about this is we've been using Skype here at Orange
3209840	3213480	Lounge Radio since before podcasting.
3213480	3219240	I think we took our first Skype call probably in 03, however old Skype is, we were on that
3219240	3220240	really early.
3220240	3222680	So it's gonna be very, you know, we're pretty loyal to the program.
3222680	3227080	I mean, until it, I don't know, steals our credit card information or something, we're
3227080	3228160	not gonna go anywhere.
3228160	3230000	Until it out parties Caz.
3230000	3231000	Exactly.
3231000	3234320	I'm gonna be, it's gonna be very interesting because pretty soon we're gonna be able to
3234320	3238880	invite phone calls from people on their Kinects to chat with the show.
3238880	3240060	That's gonna be something.
3240060	3243840	That is pretty something, except the only problem is you still can't stream the show
3243840	3247120	onto the 360.
3247120	3248120	Not yet.
3248120	3249360	I wish there was something they would do about that.
3249360	3256040	Not unless, you know, you have, I don't, no, you can't do it through Pandora or last, was
3256040	3258120	it last FM that's on there or Pandora?
3258120	3259240	I can't remember.
3259240	3260440	Last FM's on there.
3260440	3261440	Last FM.
3261440	3262440	I don't think you can get it through there.
3262440	3266800	I mean, you could hook it up to a PC, but what's the point?
3266800	3271080	I mean, you know, if it's hooked up to a PC already, then you might as well just use the
3271080	3272080	PC.
3272080	3275880	Misty, who is one of our archive experts in our chat room says she knows we were taking
3275880	3280520	them at least by episode 111, uh, which would have been 04.
3280520	3286680	I'm pretty sure we were taking them before that, but yeah, so it was a while ago.
3286680	3292040	Anyhow, um, be very curious to see what this kind of all pans out to.
3292040	3294440	Do you think, a lot of people are saying they paid too much for Skype.
3294440	3295440	What do you think?
3295440	3299360	I don't know how much Skype is worth.
3299360	3300640	It's worth nothing to me.
3300640	3302320	I'm not paying for it.
3302320	3308840	Uh, yeah, I mean, Skype doesn't really do ads and they're free, you know, it's, it's,
3308840	3312320	they're going to have to add ads to it at some point I think, and I don't know how people
3312320	3313320	are going to feel about that.
3313320	3317160	Well, they have to have some, I mean, they're, they have, you know, the Skype out services
3317160	3318160	and stuff like that.
3318160	3324580	That's kind of neat, you know, um, and you know, if they're pushing the whole family
3324580	3325580	angle and stuff.
3325580	3332480	Hey, now you can call your friends on their phones and stuff like that or, I don't know.
3332480	3337040	Alright well, the Level Up event was held by Namco Bandai this week and we want to go
3337040	3340760	over some news from that event including, and this makes me very excited, a new Soul
3340760	3343840	Calibur game was announced and I love the Soul Calibur series.
3343840	3347560	So yeah, Soul Calibur 5 was announced this week, uh, that's pretty cool, that's going
3347560	3348560	to be happening.
3348560	3352700	Um, there was a little teaser trailer that was released, let me see if I can play a little
3352700	3356120	bit of it here in the studio.
3356120	3359120	Not a whole lot of characters showed up in there, but I think, like, nightmares in there
3359120	3364840	and apparently there's a new character named Patroclus who's supposed to be the son of
3364840	3368680	Sophitia and Rothian, so it could be interesting.
3368680	3372520	The game is going to be out in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.
3372520	3377280	It is set 17 years after the events of Soul Calibur 4.
3377280	3380600	So yeah, I guess there's going to be quite a bit of roster revision going on there.
3380600	3384840	Siegfried is also supposed to be in the game, uh, so, could be interesting.
3384840	3389560	Uh, trailer won't load for me right now, YouTube's being kind of dumpy, being very slow.
3389560	3392600	Has anyone else noticed that over the past few days, that it's just been running kind
3392600	3393600	of like crap?
3393600	3394600	Uncertain files, yeah.
3394600	3395600	Yeah.
3395600	3408880	So this is one of those certain files for sure.
3408880	3412600	So this trailer is more like the opening cutscene that you would see in the game, probably.
3412600	3414080	It doesn't really show a lot of gameplay.
3414080	3418200	It's your very typical announcement trailer, but, uh, I'm looking forward to it.
3418200	3419200	It's going to be awesome.
3419200	3421120	I hope you still get to, like, make your own character and all that stuff.
3421120	3424480	Yeah, I actually didn't play any of the make your own character ones.
3424480	3427760	Very interesting tweet that actually came out in response to this.
3427760	3431880	The game director Daishi Odoshima actually tweeted this.
3431880	3437560	I asked the company if we can call the game Soul Edge 2, but they said no.
3437560	3441760	So that might give you an idea about where this is going also, because remember the first
3441760	3446640	Soul Calibur game, if you will, was really Soul Edge.
3446640	3451240	Also news coming out of the event, Tekken Cross Street Fighter hasn't even started yet.
3451240	3452920	Keep in mind there's two games being made.
3452920	3455920	There's Street Fighter Cross Tekken and Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
3455920	3459560	Apparently Namco Bandai said they haven't even really started work on Tekken Cross Street
3459560	3460560	Fighter yet.
3460560	3462600	So yeah, interesting.
3462600	3467480	The quote from producer Katushiro Harada said, quote, we really haven't started on Tekken
3467480	3468760	Cross Street Fighter.
3468760	3471920	Things are going well with Street Fighter Cross Tekken and we'll have more on that at
3471920	3472920	E3.
3472920	3474320	We hope you look forward to that.
3474320	3476440	So I don't know, maybe they're spacing the games out a little bit.
3476440	3477440	Kind of interesting.
3477440	3481160	By the way, speaking of Street Fighter Cross Tekken, a new teaser came out for it this
3481160	3484640	week and it shows Kami.
3484640	3488240	So Kami will be in the game, which really doesn't surprise anyone, I'm sure.
3488240	3491440	Some other little bits and pieces that came out of that as well.
3491440	3496860	Ace Combat Assault Horizons coming out October 11th in the US and the 14th in Europe.
3496860	3501920	There's a new CG feature film based on Tekken called Tekken Blood Vengeance.
3501920	3507440	Tales of Graces and Tales of Abyss also coming out on the PS3 and the 3DS respectively.
3507440	3512360	And wait for it, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact coming out on the PSP because
3512360	3516120	your life just wasn't complete without another Naruto game.
3516120	3519400	I also know your lives just aren't complete unless we do the segment here on the show
3519400	3524860	called the Classic Game of the Week.
3524860	3529080	Every week we take a trip down memory lane where Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault
3529080	3533880	and finds a game that she thinks you kids need to be playing.
3533880	3535440	This is one some of you might remember.
3535440	3536960	This isn't too old.
3536960	3537960	No.
3537960	3541680	And funny enough, totally ironically, I had no idea Dark Sakura was going to pick this
3541680	3542680	game.
3542680	3544200	I was playing this last night.
3544200	3545200	Crazy.
3545200	3548080	Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
3548080	3549080	Umjama-lami.
3549080	3550080	Umjama-lami.
3550080	3551080	Okay.
3551080	3554340	And I put in the one I thought was your favorite.
3554340	3558200	This is my favorite song in the soundtrack.
3558200	3567600	Anyway, Umjama-lami, yeah, and I did cover Parappa series, but I'm doing Umjama-lami
3567600	3568600	anyway.
3568600	3569600	I don't care.
3569600	3575520	Umjama-lami was put out by Nana On'Sha and Namco in the arcade, well Namco in the arcade.
3575520	3577080	Sorry the music died behind you.
3577080	3578920	It's just YouTube's failing us tonight.
3578920	3579920	Sorry guys.
3579920	3580920	It's being uber fail.
3580920	3587200	Um, at any rate, it came out in Japan on March 18th, 1999 and in North America on August
3587200	3588200	17th, 1999.
3588200	3590760	And yeah, it plays like Parappa, pretty much.
3590760	3598240	Um, Namco released the arcade version and it had a guitar controller so that, um, you
3598240	3600240	could get the sensation of playing a guitar.
3600240	3603400	I mean, it's very similar to Guitar Freaks.
3603400	3605560	We've seen one of these machines, remember?
3605560	3606560	I do.
3606560	3607560	I do remember the machine.
3607560	3610560	I had to like get on my knees to play it.
3610560	3612840	Get your minds out of the gutter, people.
3612840	3615800	It was made for kids and I'm a little tall.
3615800	3621680	Anyway, it's like a Simon Says sort of thing, so, you know, they, their characters will
3621680	3625920	do something and then you do something and you have to basically repeat whatever it tells
3625920	3627680	you to do.
3627680	3633920	And so through the game, you have a Chop Chop Master Onion from Parappa and that's where
3633920	3635480	you get Dojo Casino.
3635480	3636480	It's all in the mind.
3636480	3640000	And she goes, yeah, my guitar is in my mind.
3640000	3646520	And then, um, but the whole thing is basically Lammy trying to get to her concert with her
3646520	3650120	group Milk Can at the Chop Chop Master Arena.
3650120	3654560	And so she has to put out a fire and babysit babies with Kathy Pillar, which is a song,
3654560	3659760	and then fly an airplane and then chop down a tree to make a new guitar.
3659760	3667800	And then she actually, um, well, gets sent to an island, but in the Japanese version,
3667800	3672360	she's actually, she actually dies and goes to hell.
3672360	3677440	And I found a movie file of that to play for everybody.
3677440	3679840	Oh, that's my cue, isn't it?
3679840	3680840	Sorry.
3680840	3681840	Yes, it is, Rob.
3681840	3682840	Here we go.
3682840	3685400	And this is where Rob stops texting on his iPhone.
3685400	3686400	Hold on.
3686400	3687400	Let me bring this up.
3687400	3698640	Here, you can have this too.
3698640	3699640	Distortion.
3699640	3700640	Thank you.
3700640	3707640	Two more minutes and I'm history.
3707640	3713880	She's running in front of traffic.
3713880	3714880	These interludes were so bad.
3714880	3720800	So it's not the banana peel that PJ Berry is eating the bananas.
3720800	3725800	Cracks her head and dies.
3725800	3728960	Stupid PJ Berry.
3728960	3729960	Stupid fat bear.
3729960	3730960	Phew.
3730960	3731960	It was a dream.
3731960	3732960	Am I dead?
3732960	3733960	No, bitch.
3733960	3734960	You're 2D.
3734960	3735960	Is this hell?
3735960	3750200	That's what I think every time I show up to this show, too.
3750200	3755320	What a stupid game.
3755320	3756320	And then the credits roll.
3756320	3757320	This is great.
3757320	3778400	And then she goes on stage with, uh, Teriyaki Yoko.
3778400	3783440	Yeah, and that whole thing was cut out of the U.S. version.
3783440	3788240	Yeah, they had her showing up on a desert island.
3788240	3793200	And so it went into the whole Vital Idol song.
3793200	3801480	And where she gets faxed back to life instead of teleported via fax from the island.
3801480	3802480	So yeah.
3802480	3806760	Um, now I will tell you something, because I'll tell you why I picked this, is that Dan
3806760	3809020	and I discussed this today.
3809020	3815520	And I was saying how I had a demo disc of this, and it had all of the stuff in the game
3815520	3817380	just locked out.
3817380	3823120	And it had the original, you know, because in Time Trap Master Onion's song it said,
3823120	3825320	you could play in hell and go far.
3825320	3830600	And it's on the demo disc, not on, anyway, but all this was left in in Europe and Japan.
3830600	3834760	But in the U.S. people had to get a stick up their butt and have her go to an island.
3834760	3842120	So anyway, um, you have four different ranks, you have good, you have bad, and you have
3842120	3846200	awful, and if you get a little awful, then your song ends.
3846200	3849320	And the quality of the music changes also with each, each one too.
3849320	3853680	But now you can also get cool, and so you basically freestyle unless you, uh, really
3853680	3854680	screw up.
3854680	3858800	But if you keep cool by the end of the song, you'll get a cool ending to the level.
3858800	3864840	And, but if it flashes good, then you go back into normal play.
3864840	3869240	Like, uh, for this one, you know, if you get cool, then Terry Akioka goes, okay, you can
3869240	3870840	go by yourself, and then you're in this tunnel.
3870840	3875760	But if, uh, you, you drop back down to good, he goes, okay, well you need me after all.
3875760	3880600	But you also get different, um, uh, morphers to your sound.
3880600	3885840	You get a flanger, you get a harmonizer, you get the wah-wah, you get distortion and a
3885840	3886840	reverb.
3886840	3890600	And then there are actually some different, uh, items that you get, like, in order, it's
3890600	3896680	a fire siren, a caterpillar rattle, um, Captain Fuss and Pepper's false teeth, who was the,
3896680	3900680	uh, head-banging pilot in, uh, I think stage four.
3900680	3901680	Uh, you get-
3901680	3902680	Oh god, I love that stage.
3902680	3903680	Can I play that music?
3903680	3904680	Sure.
3904680	3905680	That music was awesome.
3905680	3908600	You know, I could never beat that unless I did it cool.
3908600	3909600	Really?
3909600	3910600	That level?
3910600	3911600	Uh-huh.
3911600	3914600	But I could always get it to go cool.
3914600	3936760	That's a trap level.
3936760	3940720	This person's going for cool, too, so, anyhow.
3940720	3941720	Yeah.
3941720	3950720	Um, and so you also got, um, like, a, uh, a thievertime, so that if, you know, when
3950720	3956360	you enter a level after it's been completed, it brings up a chocolate screen with symbols,
3956360	3962040	and if you input everything in the right order, when the level is cool, the screen goes really
3962040	3967680	crazy, and symbols fly all over the place, and then you can hit those buttons repeatedly
3967680	3969320	and get uber points.
3969320	3975840	So yeah, the, um, the arcade version was called Um Jammer Lamy Now, and it had a guitar controller,
3975840	3980560	and it had, um, the buttons for triangle, circle, x, and square are strummers in the
3980560	3984720	middle of the guitar, and the L button is a slider at the top of the guitar, and there's
3984720	3990240	a scratch disk at the bottom, um, that's, instead of the R button, and, but it's really
3990240	3998080	the same as the, uh, home version, and there, uh, is, uh, an ability to play with Parappa
3998080	3999080	in that, too.
3999080	4004120	So you've got Lamy mode, and then you have your co-op, which is Lamy and Ramy, who is
4004120	4011760	the dark version of Lamy, then you have versus, which is Lamy versus Ramy, you have solo Parappa,
4011760	4016240	you have Lamy and Parappa, and then you have, um, versus Lamy and Parappa, and then you
4016240	4018240	have a special mode.
4018240	4025800	So, um, it's, uh, basically you can just listen to any of the songs in good, bad, awful, or
4025800	4031560	cool mode, and, of course, you could also do that if you had the PSX play a little program
4031560	4034840	and could rip all your files, but, uh, I digress.
4034840	4039880	So, um, you also had, uh, yeah, like I said, there were the, the changes.
4039880	4047120	Now, I, I brought up the hell changes, um, but for, uh, Paul Chuck in stage five, instead
4047120	4051600	of chopping trees down for the fun, it was changed knowing that we're here for the fun,
4051600	4060920	and then, of course, Terry Akioko, like I said, and, uh, Lamy is actually wearing a
4060920	4069160	camouflage t-shirt and, uh, has jungle makeup to show that she's in the jungle, ooh, and
4069160	4076600	then, um, also, uh, this, the scene before stage seven has Catty Cat and Masan riding
4076600	4083520	a camel, and, uh, the ending credits is, uh, an instrumental version of Keep Your Head
4083520	4088080	Up, and then Chop Chop Master Onion's music was, of course, changed.
4088080	4092880	The demo, like I said, has everything in it, and then there was, uh, there was three soundtracks
4092880	4098920	came out, one called Make It Sweet, which is all the music done by Milk Can, and, uh,
4098920	4104120	there was called Ice Cream, which was remixed versions of the songs, and then, um, and that
4104120	4109600	was with, uh, Dread Fox's Parappa, and then the whole original soundtrack, which I've
4109600	4110600	got somewhere.
4110600	4118080	So yeah, the game is super awesome, it's super fun, and, uh, it's, uh, really great, but
4118080	4120720	I still think it's stupid that they had to change it.
4120720	4125920	In fact, uh, Game Vortex, uh, criticized it, and I think this is the best way of saying
4125920	4129760	something that said it was an unfortunate thing, and said, did I miss some logical leap?
4129760	4133640	I think our kids can handle such a basic concept as hell.
4133640	4134640	The end.
4134640	4138080	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Umm Jamma Lemmy.
4138080	4140360	You know, and I was none the wiser when I first played this game, because, you know,
4140360	4142960	I wasn't really following the import gaming scene, you know.
4142960	4149820	See, I had bought a certain game, actually, it was at Anime Expo, and I talked my way
4149820	4153360	into a demo disc, because I was so excited about this game.
4153360	4154360	Nice.
4154360	4155360	Alright.
4155360	4159280	Well, there it is, your classic game of the week, uh, anyhow, we, uh, are gonna take a
4159280	4161920	quick break here live, but don't go anywhere, guys.
4161920	4165840	We got plenty more to come in Part B tonight, including some other new game announcements.
4165840	4171360	Uh, in rapid fire news tonight, uh, a big arcade collection's been announced, also,
4171360	4175640	uh, a big popular beta has been announced for later this year, it's gonna be huge.
4175640	4181400	Uh, also we're gonna get into some more lawsuits in Part B, some Portal 2 news, and, uh, yeah,
4181400	4186760	some more, uh, localization, or maybe not, just, uh, unlocalized games that you can still
4186760	4187760	buy locally.
4187760	4189360	That'll make sense in a little bit.
4189360	4193960	Anyhow, we're gonna take a break, but stay tuned, guys, we'll be back with more of Orange
4193960	4201240	Lounge Radio.
4201240	4203720	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4203720	4209600	We are live with our 413th episode on this Sunday, May the 15th of 2011, and of course,
4209600	4213620	we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the
4213620	4216440	Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com.
4216440	4220640	So we're just coming out on a music break, and some discussions there in Part A about,
4220640	4224600	uh, PlayStation Network, of course, coming back online, although, I don't know, it's
4224600	4226280	still a little spotty for some people.
4226280	4229920	Monster World 4 getting a localization finally, and of course the big story this week about
4229920	4231680	Microsoft buying Skype.
4231680	4235600	Uh, I noticed in studio here that Loki is playing Portal 2.
4235600	4238800	It looks very nice on your laptop, I gotta say, the graphics for that are, uh, pretty
4238800	4239800	smooth.
4239800	4242240	You must have a pretty powerful little laptop there, I didn't realize.
4242240	4243240	Yes, I do.
4243240	4244240	Nice.
4244240	4245240	So, are you enjoying the game so far?
4245240	4246240	Yeah.
4246240	4249640	I'm not too far into it, from what I can tell, so, awesome.
4249640	4251680	Even though you had the ending ruined for you already, but that's alright.
4251680	4254200	I haven't had it ruined a long time ago.
4254200	4256360	You kinda like the spoiler stuff anyway, so, usually.
4256360	4257680	Yeah, I don't care.
4257680	4261520	Alright, uh, we don't just do Orange Lounge Radio, all of us hosts here, we do have some
4261520	4265020	side projects, we usually like to take this opportunity to plug those projects.
4265020	4268560	If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, you might enjoy these other great shows.
4268560	4269560	Dark Sakura?
4269560	4276960	I do Comic Insanity with, uh, Tiara, also known as Mara & Marvel, and Dan Shadow, and
4276960	4282480	we have a new one coming up on Tuesday with our new format, where we introduce a few new
4282480	4286760	segments and, uh, condense a couple other segments, so it's new stuff.
4286760	4293560	But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S, and you can also find us on Twitter at Comic
4293560	4296200	Insanity, with no I.
4296200	4297200	Alright.
4297200	4302600	Well, uh, my podcast that I do with my buddy, Extafur, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth,
4302600	4306080	about all things World of Warcraft, we're not having a format switch this week, but
4306080	4309520	I believe we're having Dark Sakura on as our guest this week, so that'll be exciting.
4309520	4310520	Hopefully.
4310520	4311520	Yep.
4311520	4316400	So, uh, yeah, you can check that out, www.hordehouse.com for more information about our little program
4316400	4320040	there, uh, where we talk about the World of Warcraft, but never too seriously, because
4320040	4324520	I'll tell you what, I've been kind of a jaded Warcraft player lately, so I have not been
4324520	4326880	the most happy-go-lucky about the game.
4326880	4329800	And I know everybody's like, well then quit, asshole!
4329800	4335200	But uh, I've got too many friends that play, and how would I slay internet dragons without
4335200	4336200	my wow?
4336200	4339280	Anyhow, uh, more talk about World of Warcraft on that show.
4339280	4340280	Fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap,
4340280	4341280	fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap.
4341280	4342280	I do not fap to Warcraft.
4342280	4345880	Although, apparently, I don't wanna give too much away, but apparently Extafur's been playing
4345880	4352040	on a server notorious for the fap chat, and uh, he's gonna give us a report on that this
4352040	4353880	week, so that should be exciting.
4353880	4357520	As a role-player, you're gonna really look forward to that, huh, Dar Sakura?
4357520	4359520	Oh, baby.
4359520	4363640	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick stuff.
4363640	4367040	There was a lot of little stories this week that unfortunately the PlayStation Network
4367040	4369880	was kind of dominating over, but let's get to it.
4369880	4370880	Loki, some quick stuff.
4370880	4373500	And oh, by the way, your Twitter topic's coming up after this.
4373500	4376480	If you haven't gotten your tweets in, you got like two minutes to do it, twitter.com
4376480	4377480	slash o-l-r.
4377480	4382600	Including one item that actually will be played on the PlayStation Network, Starhawk.
4382600	4387520	It is the new, I guess, more futuristic sequel to Warhawk.
4387520	4391240	That'll be coming soon, hopefully.
4391240	4395920	I'm sure it's gonna be something they show off at E3, and been teased for a while.
4395920	4399640	I even think there's some assets or something that leaked out about it.
4399640	4402400	But apparently, oh, next year is when it's due out.
4402400	4404880	It'll be the same kind of format as Warhawk was.
4404880	4408800	They even promised space battles at some point.
4408800	4414520	Not sure how that's gonna really work, but also a single player story mode, and a build
4414520	4417320	and battle system will be coming to it as well.
4417320	4421520	So, if you like that game, you may wanna check it out.
4421520	4426320	I know that the original game's really cheap right now, so if you wanna check that out,
4426320	4428600	it might be worth it.
4428600	4439520	And then, of course, yes, the developers of Splosion Man comes Splosion, Ms. Splosion Man.
4439520	4451280	And of course, not to pass up capitalizing on what might be an internet sensation, 2G1C.
4451280	4455060	Some people may think Two Girls, One Cup, but no, Two Girls, One Controller.
4455060	4459160	So in this game mode, you'll- I try not to think about Two Girls, One Cup ever.
4459160	4460160	Yeah.
4460160	4461500	Thanks, Loki.
4461500	4465400	Two Girls, One Controller, it's a different mode that's gonna be in the game.
4465400	4471980	You're actually gonna control each one of the Ms. Splosion Men with one analog stick
4471980	4477240	on the controller, and you would detonate them with the trigger buttons, I believe.
4477240	4482740	So that's interesting.
4482740	4486260	I don't know how that'll play, but it's something that they're throwing in that you can try
4486260	4487680	out.
4487680	4494160	And then finally, as I was mentioning earlier, of course, the new update coming out for the
4494160	4495160	Xbox 360.
4495160	4501040	It's gonna reflash those people that had modified firmwares on their DVD drives.
4501040	4509160	Well, to combat that, of course, people out there have tools to get around things, and
4509160	4516360	one hacker or tool maker, I guess, Electron, has released E-Tool version 0.2.
4516360	4522280	It is a new tool for extracting and injecting the key from the light-on fat drives that
4522280	4525680	were flashed with the new firmware by the Beta Dash.
4525680	4532680	So because those firmwares, once they get flashed, it's unable to be read by popular
4532680	4535460	programs like the Jungle Flasher and stuff like that.
4535460	4539360	So now this program will actually read the keys from that, and it will also reflash the
4539360	4540360	drives for you.
4540360	4545940	So I have a feeling that this new format that they're gonna be putting out there will get
4545940	4547680	bypassed very quickly.
4547680	4552760	In fact, I have a feeling it will be bypassed within a month.
4552760	4559360	That's probably being very generous.
4559360	4561800	And then, yeah, that's it.
4561800	4562800	All right.
4562800	4566560	So do you think that hack poses a pretty serious threat to all the researchers?
4566560	4567560	Well, it's one of many.
4567560	4575480	I mean, Commodore Forever, they're working on a new firmware for all drives, actually,
4575480	4578940	and I believe that already is almost done.
4578940	4584780	They're just doing some further testing with the new XG, what is it, the XG-D3 format.
4584780	4590120	So I'm assuming, though, that that's probably gonna be bypassed.
4590120	4595120	Then there's also the X360 key, which is supposed to be coming out at some point.
4595120	4599880	That's gonna emulate the drive altogether, and that, I think, is the worst threat they
4599880	4607760	could possibly have, because right there, that's playing game ISOs off of a hard drive
4607760	4610300	without needing to really modify your system.
4610300	4611300	It's plug-and-play.
4611300	4614600	You just plug it in between your drive and the system.
4614600	4615960	All right.
4615960	4620560	Well, let's move on to some other games coming out this year that, oh my gosh, this one is
4620560	4624920	highly anticipated, and I say this year as I hope it comes out this year, although they
4624920	4626880	haven't really said.
4626880	4631680	Diablo 3, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this, apparently, the internal
4631680	4636440	company-wide testing has begun, the internal testing process for Diablo 3.
4636440	4641120	According to Mike Morheim, who's the Blizzard CEO, or I guess he's the guy in charge over
4641120	4642960	there, he's saying the game looks great.
4642960	4647560	We are currently targeting a quarter-three launch for external beta testing.
4647560	4648560	Awesome.
4648560	4653120	They are working to get the game out before 2012, but no promises as of yet.
4653120	4658760	Also, in regards to Diablo 3, apparently there was a promotional video that showed up on
4658760	4661840	the internet.
4661840	4666080	It did finally go official, but it wasn't supposed, I think this was leaked early from
4666080	4668280	the Korean side of Blizzard Entertainment.
4668280	4671080	There's a new follower system in Diablo 3.
4671080	4674840	You actually hire characters to help you out in the game.
4674840	4677920	This kind of sounds inspired by Torchlight, actually, because you can kind of have the
4677920	4683040	pet in one of the classes, you can get all these little demon followers, pretty cool.
4683040	4688240	But these followers will actually be in different classes, Enchantress, Scoundrel, Templars.
4688240	4692760	You're gonna be able to give these guys weapons, rings, and you'll even be able to give them
4692760	4693760	their own skills.
4693760	4697320	Yeah, this really sounds like the pets from Torchlight, but maybe a little more fleshed
4697320	4698320	out.
4698320	4699320	So that's pretty exciting.
4699320	4702120	Dark Souls, this game is gonna be hard as hell.
4702120	4705560	It's gonna come out October 11th, of course, this is the unofficial, well, I shouldn't
4705560	4711040	say unofficial, but the, don't call it a sequel, but it is to Demon's Souls, which was one
4711040	4713240	of those hard as hell games on the PlayStation 3.
4713240	4717320	One of the best, hands down, PlayStation 3 exclusive games.
4717320	4721440	Dark Souls is gonna be coming out on October 11th.
4721440	4724880	Even though there's been the PlayStation Network outages and so forth, that's not gonna stop
4724880	4725880	them.
4725880	4730720	But Kai Hirono, who's the producer of the game, spoke with CVG saying that the outage
4730720	4735160	caused, quote, some problems for the development, but that the team is, quote, in contact with
4735160	4738680	Sony and is aiming to meet a street date of October 11th.
4738680	4741640	Well, it's nice that Sony's talking to some of their people.
4741640	4747320	And also, finally, from me tonight, oh God, it's taken only 413 episodes of Orange Lounge
4747320	4752000	Radio, but finally, I get to report on a story about Lady Gaga.
4752000	4753000	Yay!
4753000	4758040	And yes, it reports, I'm sorry, it relates to gaming.
4758040	4765080	That's right, Lady Gaga is coming to, I can't believe I'm gonna say this either, Farmville.
4765080	4768600	Oh, I saw the ads for that.
4768600	4774040	Yeah, Lady Gaga and Zynga a while ago had this whole donation for Japanese disaster
4774040	4781240	relief going on, and I guess that partnership has grown into the May 17th opening of Gagaville.
4781240	4786120	It is going to be a neighbor to Farmville.
4786120	4792000	It's gonna feature unicorns, crystals, and your chance to listen to new tracks from the
4792000	4793680	album Born This Way.
4793680	4799840	Apparently, you're gonna get, like, download vouchers for the album with $25 gift cards,
4799840	4805540	a word with friends contest to get exclusive DACA merchandise, and so forth.
4805540	4806540	Kind of interesting.
4806540	4811320	At first, I kind of looked at this and I was like, oh God, really, this is so gross.
4811320	4814780	I'm gonna have to go and play Farmville again if I want to hear new Gaga songs.
4814780	4817520	Like fuck you, Lady Gaga, I don't want to do this.
4817520	4823080	But then I kind of thought about it and I'm like, actually, considering that Gaga's fan
4823080	4832920	base is a lot of, let's face it, losers, fuck you, middle aged to teenage girls, and who's
4832920	4834760	playing mostly Farmville?
4834760	4836360	Middle aged to teenage girls.
4836360	4841240	So whereas I'm not super excited about this, like, they're targeting the right audience.
4841240	4843080	So it is really smart marketing.
4843080	4848120	Of course, just as a person who's not a big fan of Zynga products, I'm not that excited,
4848120	4849980	but I get it.
4849980	4854120	She was on American Idol the other day and I just, I don't get it.
4854120	4860200	I really don't understand the appeal of her and I have no appeal of her as a person, her
4860200	4862520	as an artist, her music.
4862520	4864800	It's just, it's seriously lost on me.
4864800	4866400	I think her music's very catchy.
4866400	4867400	That's what it's all about.
4867400	4871640	And I think she's a very genuine person from her interviews and so forth.
4871640	4872640	She's genuine.
4872640	4873640	Yeah, I understand.
4873640	4880340	I mean, yes, there's a lot of marketing machine behind it, yes, but I, she's a living, breathing
4880340	4881360	piece of art.
4881360	4886020	That's how I see her, but that's okay if you don't get it.
4886020	4888520	Art is meant to be interpreted in many different ways.
4888520	4889520	Yeah.
4889520	4890520	Okay.
4890520	4892320	I'm sorry.
4892320	4896240	Being as strange as possible is not art.
4896240	4897900	How fucking cra- What's your excuse?
4897900	4899720	How fucking crazy can I be?
4899720	4905600	Well, hey, I'm not fucking calling what I do art, but seriously, if anyone calls it-
4905600	4906880	I just keep thinking of Eddie Izzard now.
4906880	4912640	It was like, I'm going to put poop on my head and sell myself to an art gallery.
4912640	4919120	Yes, I'm waiting for the full fecal suit from, you know, Lady Gaga, because it's, it's,
4919120	4920120	it's on its way.
4920120	4922320	That's the path that she is traveling.
4922320	4926440	Maybe when she's in the retirement home, 50 years from now, she'll be wearing a poop suit.
4926440	4927440	Please.
4927440	4936120	It's just gonna be, I don't know, she'll have, uh, she'll make, like, some sort of suit out
4936120	4942240	of some sort of dinosaur fossil, come out there, you know, calling like an eagle or
4942240	4947840	something like that, take a giant dump on stage, roll around in it, and set herself
4947840	4949040	on fire.
4949040	4950040	Boom!
4950040	4951040	Lady Gaga concert!
4951040	4952040	Next year!
4952040	4953040	Okay?
4953040	4956040	Alright, look, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but this is too much Lady Gaga chat
4956040	4958160	for our show, so let's move on with some more gaming news.
4958160	4960760	Do you, do you never saw the link I sent, the two links I sent you?
4960760	4961760	What's that?
4961760	4967760	Well, you know, I keep up with the, uh, gal fashion, and one of the companies that I like
4967760	4973000	their clothes is actually Lady Gaga's working with one of the men's styles to release a
4973000	4974400	bunch of t-shirts.
4974400	4977920	I get all my news from the Fuck Yeah Lady Gaga Tumblr.
4977920	4979920	Anyhow.
4979920	4981880	And I sent you paper dolls.
4981880	4982880	Let's move on.
4982880	4983880	More gaming news.
4983880	4986720	Okay, well, how about Angry Birds?
4986720	4990360	It's on Chrome OS and the Chrome browser.
4990360	4995240	You can actually, uh, play it, um, now, apparently.
4995240	5001880	Um, it's free to play, has microtransactions, but the, uh, web-exclusive ones have Chrome
5001880	5007640	bombs, and exclusive Chrome levels, and the paper use Mighty Eagle.
5007640	5010000	Yeah, don't care.
5010000	5011520	What, Rob?
5011520	5014440	So I'm just reading our chatroom chat.orangelandraday.com.
5014440	5018600	Tiger Claw says, doing OLR should be considered an art form.
5018600	5023000	And Salacious Pop says, OMG Lady Gaga channeling GG Allen.
5023000	5026320	He did all those, or maybe Alin, I don't know this artist, but he did all of those things
5026320	5030240	that Loki just, he did all those things that Loki just said, by the way, including the
5030240	5031520	fire in the poop.
5031520	5032520	Yeah.
5032520	5034840	So it's already been done, Loki, so I can't do it.
5034840	5035840	I'm sorry.
5035840	5036840	How about gaming?
5036840	5037840	Yes.
5037840	5038840	Minecraft stuff.
5038840	5048120	Uh, basically the creator, um, Marcus Pearson, is, uh, has a poll on his blog about Minecraft
5048120	5052720	Con, seeing if people would be interested in attending it in Las Vegas, so there is
5052720	5060520	a, uh, a no and a yes, and so far no is winning, so.
5060520	5064960	I will be bringing a bunch of blocks to put in front of the door to trap everyone in Minecraft
5064960	5066280	Con.
5066280	5071440	I'm looking at this screen capture from, I'm guessing, from Minecraft, and it looks completely,
5071440	5075560	these people have too much damn time.
5075560	5076840	So how about Mortal Kombat?
5076840	5081800	Yeah, I don't know, I think Minecraft Con's not a terrible idea, because hell, they have
5081800	5086760	cons for people that dress up like furry animals, so, you know, if the furries can have their
5086760	5088360	con, you know.
5088360	5094580	Mortal Kombat Collection will be, the original trilogy will be going on the Xbox Live Arcade
5094580	5098880	and the Playstation Network, and, of course, Collection is spelled with a K, and it will
5098880	5102160	also be on PC for 800 Microsoft points.
5102160	5105160	Does Lady Gaga have a convention?
5105160	5107760	Would it be called Gaga for GagaCon?
5107760	5108760	Perhaps.
5108760	5111440	I know Cher has a convention, did I ever tell you about that story?
5111440	5115520	I was in, uh, LA, I was in Woodland Hills specifically for work, doing some stuff down
5115520	5119440	there, and, uh, I was staying at a hotel, and I get in this elevator with literally
5119440	5123920	fifteen people all decked out in Cher shirts and concert, and I was kinda like, oh, is
5123920	5124920	Cher in town?
5124920	5127320	They're like, no, there's a Cher convention going on here at the hotel.
5127320	5129000	And I'm like, oh.
5129000	5130000	Is she here?
5130000	5131840	And they're like, no, she's in France.
5131840	5133340	Like, oh.
5133340	5135480	But she sent a video or something like that.
5135480	5138240	If I could turn back time.
5138240	5142960	I literally walked into a Cher convention, and despite what you may think about homosexuals,
5142960	5145160	I'm not, like, screaming, ah, for Cher.
5145160	5146160	Like, she's cool.
5146160	5147160	I think she's pretty fierce.
5147160	5149960	I wonder what's the show about Chaz.
5149960	5154360	I don't, yeah, I don't really follow the Cher stuff, but my mother loves Cher.
5154360	5157240	I got dragged to a Cher concert by my mother.
5157240	5158520	Rob.
5158520	5160080	I just love Cher.
5160080	5162480	She's so funny.
5162480	5163720	She's such a diva, Rob.
5163720	5166160	I like your mom.
5166160	5167400	I want your mom to adopt me.
5167400	5169600	I can't believe she's younger than me, though.
5169600	5174340	All right, anyhow, um, oh yeah, Mortal Kombat Collection, sounds great.
5174340	5178400	If we didn't already have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox Live Arcade and Mortal Kombat
5178400	5180920	2 on PlayStation Network.
5180920	5183240	But then they stopped selling 3 or something?
5183240	5184240	They did.
5184240	5186120	Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was delisted some time ago.
5186120	5190640	Yeah, it was delisted after they decided, hey, we're gonna re-release it again.
5190640	5191640	Haha.
5191640	5193280	All right.
5193280	5197120	Anyhow, Rama in our chatroom says, Gaga convention?
5197120	5199060	It's called the West Village, Rob.
5199060	5200400	So noted.
5200400	5204560	I would like to pick up that whole Mortal Kombat with the new arcade stick they're gonna
5204560	5209600	put out, though, because Mortal Kombat 2 especially was so awesome, especially with the real stick.
5209600	5213120	Well, they were, whatever happened to, they were supposed to be putting out an HD collection
5213120	5216120	or something like that on the PlayStation 3, it's gonna be all the Mortal Kombat games,
5216120	5217120	like, re-done.
5217120	5218120	I think that's this.
5218120	5221160	But this isn't this, or this isn't that.
5221160	5226480	It's basically just, hey, look, we're porting the shit straight over, we're not doing anything
5226480	5227480	to it.
5227480	5228480	Then they decide, hey, you know what?
5228480	5229760	They decide to put out some poop and set it on fire.
5229760	5234520	It's too much work to actually do something, let's just re-release the old shit.
5234520	5236520	Alright.
5236520	5237520	Let's go to some Twitter.
5237520	5239000	Let's do the Nintendo way.
5239000	5244160	Let's go to the tweets, twitter.com slash olr, tweet, tweet, tweet.
5244160	5247720	Every week you guys tweet us and we read your tweets, unless you're gonna tweet something
5247720	5251160	that we're gonna talk about on the show in about 30 minutes, anyway.
5251160	5254400	I'mNotBenji sends us a tweet, well then who are you?
5254400	5257280	Sends us a tweet saying, can I pre-F you?
5257280	5261280	If so, F you to being at a place tonight where I can't listen to OLR.
5261280	5263840	That is screwed up, F that.
5263840	5269160	I would say though, just a tip, if you are a smartphone owner, especially like the iPhones,
5269160	5271520	I'm not sure how well this works on Android and the other stuff, because I'm an iPhone
5271520	5276960	owner, but allgames.com runs on HTML5, so you can actually get the feed by just going
5276960	5282720	to allgames.com on your iPhone or whatever, so just saying, just for future reference.
5282720	5285920	BobbyBlackWolf tweeted us that he has now sent the best email ever.
5285920	5288240	I'm looking forward to it.
5288240	5294440	FunnyTman tweets us saying, this is a fun little Metroidvania type game I found.
5294440	5300920	So I'm going to the link here, it's IndieGames.com, and the game is called Hydra Castle Labyrinth
5300920	5301920	Buster.
5301920	5305740	Oh, maybe that's the author, I don't know, but Hydra Castle Labyrinth.
5305740	5311720	It's a freeware 2D platformer created by E. Hashimoto, who made Akuji the Demon and Guardian
5311720	5313800	of Paradise.
5313800	5320200	It's similar to La Mulana, and the Castlevania series.
5320200	5323580	The health gauge and sub weapon indicator are both displayed on the top left corner
5323580	5325200	of the screen.
5325200	5332280	Hydra Castle Labyrinth you can download from Buster's site, hp.vector.code.jp.
5332280	5335220	This sounds pretty cool, and it's only 1.25 megs.
5335220	5340880	I will kindly link this in our chat room, so if you guys want to check that out, there
5340880	5341880	you go.
5341880	5344640	Enjoy.
5344640	5347960	It sounds like Dark Tetsuya has already played it, I'm so not surprised.
5347960	5348960	Alright.
5348960	5352240	Sj100matt tweets us a couple things, one of them is coming up a little later in the show,
5352240	5356360	but the other one I want to mention is, with arcades being closed down, a new video game
5356360	5360060	themed lounge has opened up in Las Vegas, looks nice.
5360060	5365120	You know, I heard there's a new arcade in San Francisco as well, and I can't remember
5365120	5367180	for the life of me what the name is.
5367180	5371240	Maybe somebody in chat won't figure it out for me, but there's a new arcade in San Francisco
5371240	5372880	I think, I haven't been to yet.
5372880	5377440	And now apparently there's this place called Insert Coins in Las Vegas, it's a video lounge
5377440	5378440	game bar.
5378440	5380080	Yeah, I remember seeing that.
5380080	5381980	Huh, that sounds kind of neat.
5381980	5386800	It will, according to the website here that I'm on right now, Insert Coins will electrify
5386800	5393720	all your senses with its revolutionary amalgamation of classic arcades, ultra lounge service,
5393720	5398480	console video gaming, and the world's greatest video DJs, all under its 7,000 square foot
5398480	5403560	roof, nestled in the iconic neon-laden Fremont East District of Las Vegas.
5403560	5406200	That actually sounds kind of awesome, I got to say.
5406200	5411960	It sounds like it's video games meets booze meets loud music.
5411960	5412960	Sounds awesome.
5412960	5415440	Maybe this type of shit's ready to make a resurgence.
5415440	5416440	That's kind of what I'm hoping.
5416440	5419960	Like, you know, I got to say, when I went to Portland, one of the most awesome places
5419960	5424600	I went to was the barcade that they had there, and I apologize, I forget the name of it,
5424600	5425600	but it's-
5425600	5426600	Ground control.
5426600	5427600	Thank you.
5427600	5428600	Thank you.
5428600	5429720	Dan's yelling at it from the other room.
5429720	5430720	Ground control.
5430720	5432920	Yeah, that place was- isn't that place fucking rad, Dan?
5432920	5436120	Oh, God, Dan, you got to go.
5436120	5440000	Oh my God, it's beer and 80s games.
5440000	5443160	All right, Dan says road trip.
5443160	5444920	We might just have to.
5444920	5445920	It's awesome.
5445920	5452080	So, anyhow, you know, it's a bummer you're starting school that week, because before
5452080	5456120	we go to LA, we could go to Portland and go to ground control.
5456120	5457880	You know, yeah, screw Dark Sakura.
5457880	5460880	You and I'll go, Dan.
5460880	5462480	Hey.
5462480	5470000	Dan and I are going to go on a bro trip.
5470000	5471000	Dan's yelling from the kitchen.
5471000	5472000	What's the first gayest thing you've ever done?
5472000	5473520	It'll be the second gayest thing-
5473520	5476960	Oh, yeah.
5476960	5478600	This is horrible radio, because they can't hear you.
5478600	5480880	We need to have a boom mic in the kitchen just for Dan.
5480880	5483560	Dan, get in here and do a report.
5483560	5489200	Dan said the first gayest thing he did was play rock band at Matt's party.
5489200	5491560	Let me move on to some more tweets.
5491560	5497360	Spazinator PSN tweets us saying PlayStation Network is down again as of 9 p.m. Eastern,
5497360	5498720	6 p.m. Pacific.
5498720	5500600	And I was like, well, wait a minute, Spazinator.
5500600	5503880	Maybe you just need to try it four times before you get in, like I had to do earlier.
5503880	5506960	But I'm looking at the official PlayStation blog.
5506960	5508360	Guess what?
5508360	5512640	We are currently experiencing an extremely heavy load of password resets.
5512640	5517640	And so we recently had to turn off services for approximately 30 minutes to clear the
5517640	5518720	queue.
5518720	5523380	As such, a large number of people are attempting to change their passwords at the same time.
5523380	5528560	It's taking longer than expected for all those emails to clear all of the ISPs.
5528560	5534600	So yep, not even 24 hours after it came back up, PlayStation Network had to go back down.
5534600	5539600	And that's all I'm going to say about that.
5539600	5541240	What a whore.
5541240	5544120	More tweets for, what, did you call it a whore?
5544120	5545120	Exactly.
5545120	5548200	Had to go back down.
5548200	5553800	Hey, Tiger Claw sends us a couple tweets.
5553800	5555680	Oops, I guess I just reported on one of them.
5555680	5560220	But I'll read this other one about the Sony Online Entertainment Senior Producer is now
5560220	5563680	the Zynga Austin GM.
5563680	5565800	That's John Blakely.
5565800	5570240	He did some projects including Star Wars Galaxies and DC Universe Onlines.
5570240	5573360	Now he's leading Zynga in Austin.
5573360	5577680	So he went from the dark side to the darker side.
5577680	5580840	All from his LinkedIn profile.
5580840	5582960	Let's see.
5582960	5587840	Candied Critique sends us a tweet saying, someone makes Counter-Strike, Osama compound
5587840	5588840	map.
5588840	5589840	Yay or nay?
5589840	5592800	I thought something like this we had discussed on the show this week.
5592800	5595740	And this isn't all too surprising.
5595740	5600100	Give a bunch of gamers a blank palette and controversial things are sure to be made everywhere
5600100	5605840	from nude patches to overly violent things to real life scenarios that may or may not
5605840	5607880	be kind of tacky playing out.
5607880	5613360	So yeah, we get linked to this article here about the Pakistani compound where Osama bin
5613360	5616800	Laden of course, I mean unless you've been living under a fucking rock, was found and
5616800	5623480	killed by US Navy Seals, is now a playable mod in, what is this, Counter-Strike.
5623480	5624700	Oh great.
5624700	5627200	So I can go into Counter-Strike and play this game.
5627200	5630480	Not only can I play real life news, but I can get called every name in the book while
5630480	5635000	doing it because Counter-Strike has a really rude online community, just so you know.
5635000	5637520	Lastly, here's a question for the host.
5637520	5639040	I like these tweets.
5639040	5640640	They're questions for the host.
5640640	5642860	That's what this really should all be about, but here you go.
5642860	5649560	TheBaconBits tweets us, IDK if it's been asked before, but what is your guys' favorite game
5649560	5651800	soundtrack of all time?
5651800	5657640	Personally, mine is the SMG OST, I'm assuming that means Super Mario Galaxy OST.
5657640	5662040	BaconBits asking, what is your favorite game soundtrack of all time?
5662040	5664560	Dark Sakura?
5664560	5668240	Uh, I...
5668240	5669240	I...
5669240	5670240	I...
5670240	5671240	I...
5671240	5672240	I...
5672240	5673240	I...
5673240	5674240	I...
5674240	5675240	I...
5675240	5676240	I...
5676240	5677240	I...
5677240	5678240	I...
5678240	5679240	I...
5679240	5680240	I...
5680240	5681240	I...
5681240	5682240	I...
5682240	5683960	Um, I don't know.
5683960	5691600	It would have to be kind of a tossup between, um, well I did like, I listened the crap out
5691600	5697440	of the Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix soundtrack when that was out because I actually bought
5697440	5702040	that at Anime Convention, which is pretty awesome, and then I'd say it's either between
5702040	5711160	4th, 5th, Max, 2, or DJ Hero 1, because DJ Hero 2 is kind of dumb.
5711160	5716480	Um, as tempted as I am to throw in a Bamani soundtrack like DDR 3rd Mix, probably my favorite
5716480	5722600	soundtrack ever, or BeatMania 2DX Fist Style, honestly, I go to the Super Nintendo and there's
5722600	5727760	three games on the Super Nintendo that for me all kind of tie, maybe one slightly ahead
5727760	5728760	for first place.
5728760	5730600	Actually, I'm going to add Super Metroid to that one.
5730600	5737360	Super Metroid would be on my top three, absolutely, Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call
5737360	5742400	it, would also be up there, but I think just the slight edge, I think probably the greatest
5742400	5745840	video game soundtrack ever made, Actraiser.
5745840	5749160	I love the Actraiser soundtrack, it is beautiful, gorgeous music.
5749160	5752000	You know what actually I'd have to add to my list would be Chrono Trigger.
5752000	5755040	Oh, Chrono Trigger's got a pretty fucking sweet soundtrack.
5755040	5756840	Linked to a pass is pretty awesome too.
5756840	5762600	I'm gonna find my favorite piece of music in Chrono Trigger and send it to you to play.
5762600	5764160	Alright you do that.
5764160	5768040	But maybe next week during the break, we're out of music breaks tonight.
5768040	5772040	Alright, that's going to do it for the tweets, twitter.com slash olr if you want to get in
5772040	5773160	early for next week.
5773160	5778680	In the meantime, more news, and oh boy, it's the lawsuit segment time.
5778680	5779680	Yay!
5779680	5780680	Yay!
5780680	5785160	This is retarded, but a former Navy- Now, Loki, don't use the R word.
5785160	5787000	You can say butt-tarded.
5787000	5788360	It's retarded.
5788360	5791520	Say gay-tarded, because it's doubly offensive.
5791520	5793520	No, it's retarded.
5793520	5800320	Former Navy pilot John Ryan McLaughlin, he is suing Bethesda, because he says that Elder
5800320	5806320	Scrolls IV Oblivion gave him a grand mal seizure that cost him his flight status.
5806320	5812040	It was his first seizure he had ever had, and it was violent enough to break a bone,
5812040	5817920	and I guess he's permanently barred from flying the F-18 planes, which he was trained on.
5817920	5822920	And he's suing them because he says Oblivion was designed that it exceeds the upper acceptable
5822920	5829280	limit of more than three flashes over one second period, as well as an acceptable spatial
5829280	5832040	pattern and luminance flash limits.
5832040	5838440	These risks were not made known to the plaintiff and or ordinary customer prior to the time
5838440	5839440	of purchase.
5839440	5840700	Bullshit, they're in the manual.
5840700	5847160	Every fucking manual has a goddamn epilepsy warning in it.
5847160	5851280	So I'm sorry, that is some serious bullshit right there.
5851280	5859520	Anyways, he wants damages for negligence, breach of warranty, and product liability.
5859520	5860520	He's gonna lose.
5860520	5868800	But yeah, every goddamn manual, and fuck, every goddamn manual since games had manuals,
5868800	5869800	have had that warning in there.
5869800	5874120	I think like from the Nintendo, well I'm sure they've had manuals for games before that,
5874120	5881240	but Nintendo I think was one of the first series of games or whatever that had manuals
5881240	5886800	that had that warning in there because I always thought it was ridiculous, but I mean people
5886800	5893720	have seizures because of flashing lights sometimes, but I'm sorry, just take some responsibility
5893720	5894720	for yourself.
5894720	5898800	Yeah, it sucks that you can't fly anymore, but you know what, if you had this problem
5898800	5903680	to begin with and this game set it off, then it's probably a good thing that you're not
5903680	5908600	flying a plane.
5908600	5912880	I mean seriously, oh he didn't realize he had seizure problems or whatever and something
5912880	5916440	flashes and he crashes the damn plane into an orphanage.
5916440	5919720	I don't remember there being an amazing seizure mode in Oblivion either, you know it wasn't
5919720	5925480	like that Pokemon cartoon from years ago where it flashed the red and blue rapidly that kind
5925480	5929840	of caused all those kids to have seizures, I don't, like, you know Oblivion's been out
5929840	5936480	for a long time now too, you know, but I think seizures are an unfortunate side effect to
5936480	5941120	gaming in general for some people, you know, unfortunately some people have to really watch
5941120	5942240	the video games they play.
5942240	5946200	For example, Dark Sakura has talked openly on the show about how she can't play first
5946200	5949360	person shooters very long, she gets motion sick, you know.
5949360	5951880	I have thrown up, Portal 2 made me throw up.
5951880	5957320	You have to control yourself, you know, and unfortunately some people have limits and
5957320	5959640	you gotta, you know, control those limits.
5959640	5960640	You can't-
5960640	5962920	Turn the brightness down on your TV when you play Oblivion or something, you know.
5962920	5968400	You can't blame a game for a problem that clearly existed before that.
5968400	5975880	If other, okay, you've got person A who has zero inclination towards epilepsy, and you've
5975880	5980920	got person B who doesn't know they have any inclination towards epilepsy, but they do.
5980920	5985820	And you sit them both in front of the same product, well of course the one who has the
5985820	5990040	inclination, whether they know about it or not, is going to react to it.
5990040	5993320	It's like how I found out I was allergic to bell peppers.
5993320	5994320	I didn't know.
5994320	5995320	My mom eats them.
5995320	5998120	I ate a bell pepper, my tongue swelled up, and I got sick.
5998120	5999120	Yeah.
5999120	6000120	You know.
6000120	6001680	And besides that, they're nasty.
6001680	6005680	BlackWolf in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com says, at least he got the seizure while playing
6005680	6007760	a video game rather than well flying.
6007760	6012000	Yeah, so like I said, yeah, would you rather he be flying a plane and, you know, get a
6012000	6015880	seizure than crash into, I don't know, an orphanage, orphanage, a mall, and-
6015880	6016880	Would you rather be-
6016880	6017880	Children.
6017880	6018880	Children.
6018880	6019880	For dead.
6019880	6023800	Well, let's talk about another lawsuit and this one, oh boy.
6023800	6027200	This is a lawsuit against Chuck E. Cheese.
6027200	6030280	Is it for the fact that they got rid of all their good arcade games?
6030280	6032280	Because I wanted to join in on that one.
6032280	6034240	Actually sort of.
6034240	6038920	It's a lawsuit against the ticket dispensing games at Chuck E. Cheese because it creates
6038920	6041600	gambling addiction in little children.
6041600	6044300	A lawsuit has been filed in California.
6044300	6046400	They're looking for five million dollars.
6046400	6048600	The person who filed the lawsuit, Denise Keller.
6048600	6051880	She's a mom, two girls, five and three.
6051880	6055980	Chuck E. Cheese's arcade games are akin to slot machines, says the complaint.
6055980	6061000	By offering tickets as a payout that can be redeemed for prizes, the machines, quote,
6061000	6065680	create the same highs and lows experienced by adults who gamble their paychecks or the
6065680	6067160	mortgage payment.
6067160	6071200	The lawyer says, it's not about the money, it's about the kids.
6071200	6072200	Right.
6072200	6075600	California law forbids gambling.
6075600	6080480	That's only like partially true because I can think of poker rooms out in Rancho Cordova,
6080480	6082000	which is an incorporated city.
6082000	6086880	And I can think of Indian casinos not far up the free with Thunder Valley, not that
6086880	6089760	far up 80, Red Hawk, not that far up 50.
6089760	6092520	And fuck, Reno is only like two hours away.
6092520	6097620	I mean, if California bans gambling, I get it.
6097620	6099360	The Indian casinos are on Indian land.
6099360	6100360	I understand that.
6100360	6101360	And the California lottery?
6101360	6103080	Yeah, the lottery.
6103080	6107420	So they don't ban gambling that well, you know what I mean?
6107420	6111240	But anyhow, it does make an exception for payouts if the contest is predominantly a
6111240	6117520	game of skill, which as you know, these crane games and skeeball games and so forth, they
6117520	6121040	are of course mainly games of skill.
6121040	6124920	Well that's awesome that those, well I don't know if it's really awesome.
6124920	6129000	It's tragic that that three and five year old are spending their hard-earned mortgage
6129000	6133200	payments and their paychecks that they get for doing what?
6133200	6134200	Coloring well?
6134200	6138240	I mean, seriously, it's the parent that's taking them to Chuck E. Cheats.
6138240	6142200	It's the parent giving them money to spend money on these games.
6142200	6143960	I don't understand.
6143960	6146040	I don't even understand the problem here.
6146040	6150420	I actually would take an unpopular opinion somewhat with this and say she actually kind
6150420	6152120	of has a point with this whole thing.
6152120	6158400	I do think this is probably not healthy for all children, but at the same time, why sue
6158400	6159960	Chuck E. Cheese over it?
6159960	6164040	That's ridiculous because you absolutely have the right to not go there.
6164040	6165040	And you know what?
6165040	6170260	I bet if enough people didn't go to Chuck E. Cheese and didn't go to have their birthday
6170260	6174100	parties at Chuck E. Cheese and let their kids have birthday parties there, they would probably
6174100	6177520	have to get rid of these machines or the company would go bankrupt or maybe they'd go back
6177520	6178880	to having legitimate arcade games.
6178880	6179880	I don't know.
6179880	6184340	I want to know why, you know, all of these, because ticket redemption games have been
6184340	6186640	around forever since I was a little kid.
6186640	6187640	Right.
6187640	6188640	It's not forever.
6188640	6189640	Don't say that.
6189640	6190640	Anyway.
6190640	6194400	Um, but why is it that we're just now getting somebody complaining about it?
6194400	6198560	I really don't get it, especially when everybody else seems to be just fine with it.
6198560	6200920	People can get addicted to anything.
6200920	6202200	I'm not finished.
6202200	6203200	Sorry.
6203200	6204200	Thank you.
6204200	6207840	The, the whole point is that it's a parenting issue.
6207840	6209760	You don't want your kids to participate in something.
6209760	6212200	You don't take them there or you don't let them play it.
6212200	6216760	Um, Salacious Pop in our chat room says many ticket games are a test of skill.
6216760	6218800	Some ticket games are goddamn bullshit.
6218800	6219800	Agreed.
6219800	6224720	Uh, The Legend of Zaku says, remember kids, America equals Sue the bastard's land.
6224720	6225840	You know, he kind of has a point.
6225840	6229960	I almost see she's teaching these kids a worse lesson by going through with this lawsuit.
6229960	6230960	This is my opinion.
6230960	6232320	Well, that's the way it is now.
6232320	6237120	If people find an opportunity to make money, they're going to gamble their chances and
6237120	6238120	do it.
6238120	6239840	I mean, it's all it.
6239840	6243560	People can make the argument that they can be addicted to anything.
6243560	6247960	So, so we get rid of everything because that's really what it's going to come down to.
6247960	6250960	You get rid of these ticket redemption games, they're going to say, oh, well, I'm addicted
6250960	6252440	to winning at arcade games.
6252440	6254240	Then you get rid of the arcade games.
6254240	6261700	Well, oh, well, I'm addicted to, uh, I don't know, um, riding in a little motorized cars
6261700	6264840	that they have at, you know, Chuck E. Cheese or something like that.
6264840	6266400	Well, then we got to get rid of those too.
6266400	6269000	Oh, well, now I'm addicted to eating pizza.
6269000	6270680	Let's get rid of pizza.
6270680	6271680	Where does it stop?
6271680	6276760	I mean, it's just people are going to be finding anything to sue over.
6276760	6281520	And this, unfortunately, is the latest in many, I'm sure lawsuits that are going to
6281520	6285620	be in our legal system forever.
6285620	6287880	We've already had this regarding casinos.
6287880	6293120	We've already had it regarding online gaming, you know, just put it this way, people, it's
6293120	6295840	like you're saying, people do have addictive personalities.
6295840	6296840	The thing exists.
6296840	6301200	Everyone's going to have their crack, whether it's, you know, watching Monday night football,
6301200	6307000	ooh, or, you know, people get obsessed about things that they're into.
6307000	6309800	It's just a matter of teaching people to control themselves.
6309800	6313660	And quite honestly, if a person can't control themselves, well, that's not my problem.
6313660	6315160	Why should my life be affected by that?
6315160	6317680	God forbid the kids have fun playing a game, you know?
6317680	6320680	Oh, hey, let's try to earn some tickets to go get a prize.
6320680	6322900	Oh, that's just blasphemy.
6322900	6326800	Why are we letting these kids, you know, get addicted to getting tickets?
6326800	6328960	They're not getting addicted to getting tickets to her kids.
6328960	6330160	They're having fun.
6330160	6333640	If they have a problem, they're like, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I need you to take me back and
6333640	6336080	go get more tickets so I can get a bigger prize.
6336080	6340040	Well, then know what you do, you say, no, I'm not fucking taking you back to get more
6340040	6341040	tickets.
6341040	6344200	And if they cry and have a tantrum, then you give them a time out or you spank them.
6344200	6347720	Is it seriously that terrible to parent your child?
6347720	6352640	I mean, shit, I know as being a parent, it's not that hard to say no.
6352640	6355680	And not only a parent, a Mensa member.
6355680	6361080	That doesn't mean it's a smart thing to do, right, Logie?
6361080	6362840	This is what smart people do.
6362840	6368200	I can't say that Akuma JP in our chat, literally, I cannot say that because you can literally
6368200	6372000	get kicked out of Mensa for saying as a Mensa member, I really, yes.
6372000	6374000	Oh my God.
6374000	6375000	Can I just lie?
6375000	6376520	It's not a tangent here.
6376520	6381360	Can I lie and say I'm a Mensa member and just say as a Mensa member, I'll get sued.
6381360	6383320	I'll probably, no, no, no, no, no.
6383320	6385040	There's some, some hilarious shit in here.
6385040	6386600	Sorry to get sidetracked here very quick.
6386600	6388520	I was going to read this comment real quick.
6388520	6391280	Akuma JP in our chatroom at chat.orangishontraday.com.
6391280	6393160	Logie is addicted to Grand Theft Auto for sure.
6393160	6399600	Oh yeah, I don't, no, seriously, I spent an unhealthy amount of my day thinking about
6399600	6401480	Grand Theft Auto, playing Grand Theft Auto.
6401480	6404400	I may or may not be addicted to World of Warcraft.
6404400	6408040	And let's face it, everyone is addicted to video games.
6408040	6411140	No, no, it's not that I'm addicted to Grand Theft Auto.
6411140	6415420	I have fun playing Grand Theft Auto, and I have fun modding Grand Theft Auto.
6415420	6418720	Why is that a problem that I like doing something, you know?
6418720	6419720	It's not like I can't stop.
6419720	6422720	You're not allowed to have fun.
6422720	6428600	Okay, um, I'm just going to tell you something.
6428600	6429600	It's just really hilarious.
6429600	6433320	I got to find, and my wife was reading this to me because she was, oh, here it is.
6433320	6437640	I think this is it right here.
6437640	6441320	Here's some rules or whatever that they have.
6441320	6444720	Oh, member policies, let's see here.
6444720	6446760	Are you allowed to read these?
6446760	6450760	Well, it's not like it's, you know, some secret guide or something.
6450760	6451760	That's not masonry.
6451760	6459160	Well, I, okay, anyways, one of the things, yeah, you can't really, you know, say something
6459160	6464440	as like saying, oh, well, as a member of Mensa, you know, I believe, blah, blah, blah.
6464440	6466800	But that wasn't even the part that I thought was ridiculous.
6466800	6472840	They give you a sample press, I kid you not, a sample press release of how you can form
6472840	6476760	your own press release to send out to your local paper and your friends saying that you
6476760	6477760	got in the Mensa.
6477760	6479320	No, I'm not that vain.
6479320	6480320	Sorry.
6480320	6481320	I, you know what though?
6481320	6485460	Like in the, it may be in a suburbia town, you know, in a big market like Sacramento,
6485460	6488920	you know, as much as we joke about ourselves, we are still like what the 20th largest market
6488920	6489920	in the nation.
6489920	6493080	But go to like the Midwest and a lot of those little towns, maybe it is kind of a big deal.
6493080	6498920	It's just like, you know, putting a big giant sign on my back that says, nerd, make fun
6498920	6502560	of me and beat my ass while you're at it.
6502560	6509440	I mean, I'm sorry, I'm not going to invite that kind of, um, attention.
6509440	6510440	All right.
6510440	6514880	Well, the next story up is dark soccer is, but she's left, so she has left the building.
6514880	6520400	Let's talk more sewer for not fulfilling your obligations to garden burgers and I was preparing
6520400	6521400	mine.
6521400	6522400	All right.
6522400	6523400	So that's it.
6523400	6524400	I'm suing garden burgers.
6524400	6525400	We're going to get rid of those crap.
6525400	6526400	God damn you.
6526400	6527400	Garden burgers.
6527400	6532120	I'm now available for beta for PC gamers.
6532120	6535120	Shut up, Dan.
6535120	6538440	I love you.
6538440	6539800	Okay.
6539800	6544320	So for people who want to do more for portal to valve has portal to authoring tools.
6544320	6545320	Yay.
6545320	6547520	If you've got a PC, you can do this.
6547520	6552320	Um, it's free for anyone who owns the game on PC and it's in the tools tab on your steam
6552320	6553680	account.
6553680	6559400	So I'm basically, you'll just be able to go into everything, character skins, a single
6559400	6562160	player, co-op level, sound effects, music, 3d models.
6562160	6563160	They are all there.
6563160	6565980	You can do them all.
6565980	6574960	But there's also nasty, Hey, there's also an updated version of face poser and a different
6574960	6578300	example maps and instances to help you learn.
6578300	6584640	So there's a new suite of command line compiling utilities.
6584640	6588480	I want someone to make the orange lounge level, made the orange lounge level.
6588480	6589480	Put it up.
6589480	6590480	All right.
6590480	6594300	Why are you looking at doors?
6594300	6599520	I'm looking at something from online, something that, uh, Alan's doing.
6599520	6600520	All right.
6600520	6601520	Moving on.
6601520	6602800	He's probably giggling that that came out.
6602800	6603800	All right.
6603800	6604800	Uh, moving on.
6604800	6605800	Loki.
6605800	6606800	What do you have for us?
6606800	6607800	Yes.
6607800	6610000	So this is kind of funny.
6610000	6615480	Apparently the PlayStation one classics, they've been slow to sell.
6615480	6617000	Um, really?
6617000	6622640	No one's wanting to buy your PlayStation one games to play them on a device that most likely
6622640	6629320	doesn't have, uh, buttons, but no, these are actually meant for the, uh, Xperia play phone
6629320	6632120	that you know, the PlayStation phone, if you will.
6632120	6640720	Um, apparently I guess there's only, um, you know, a very few, uh, sales for each one.
6640720	6646160	They're saying that under a thousand installs for each title, uh, co-orders two destruction
6646160	6648880	Derby, medieval siphon filter and jumping flash.
6648880	6651880	And most of those are actually only in the few hundreds.
6651880	6657320	Um, they're saying that also that, um, they're saying it's not really a concern since there's
6657320	6661720	only a few, um, at the, um, moment.
6661720	6667200	Um, PlayStation one titles, um, here or there, there's more coming on a regular basis.
6667200	6672000	He said, and as a whole, the PlayStation as a content provider exclusive to the device.
6672000	6673400	So there's no real concerns.
6673400	6677080	It's a revolutionary device and it's shaking up the marketplace and we're very pleased
6677080	6678080	with it.
6678080	6683000	Um, also it should be meant, you know, there is a reason why that maybe it's not working
6683000	6689800	is because, um, not necessarily on the marketplace, but you can get it for that phone.
6689800	6695200	Um, there actually are other PlayStation emulators that you can download ROMs for and those don't
6695200	6698640	cost you anything.
6698640	6699640	So maybe that's the issue.
6699640	6702700	I think a lot of people are just buying the phone because you know what?
6702700	6710000	It's kind of cool to play other games with buttons, you know, like some of the other
6710000	6711720	Android games.
6711720	6718160	I, I, yeah, this whole like lack of buttons thing, just, I can't believe they've even
6718160	6719480	sold as many as they have.
6719480	6721240	The sound is just absolutely terrible.
6721240	6723120	It's as terrible as the PSP go.
6723120	6727480	Well, I, I mean, one of the things I think that they're, they're forgetting about is
6727480	6731880	like, listen, just because this, you know, system's a PlayStation and it's not really
6731880	6736920	a PlayStation Xperia play fine, you know, just because it has a PlayStation controller
6736920	6741360	set up on it doesn't mean people are going to necessarily buy just PlayStation one games
6741360	6742360	with it.
6742360	6747620	I mean, you can get a bunch of other games that support this, you know, type of a controller
6747620	6750880	mapping and you can play those just fine.
6750880	6755020	Have you ever thought that maybe, you know, a game that was put out 10 years ago might
6755020	6758280	not stand up well against, you know, some of the newer games?
6758280	6761840	Yeah, I think Sony's just losing touch there with what people want.
6761840	6766280	Granted, Cool Borders is a pretty fun game and Destruction Derby's not bad on its own
6766280	6775620	and Medieval's all right, but like, I don't know, it's just, they're showing their age.
6775620	6778040	But you know, Kazurai's a real party animal.
6778040	6780200	He's hip to what the kids are into.
6780200	6781200	Exactly.
6781200	6785880	He's, he's, he's got his finger on the pulse of what's hot.
6785880	6787800	What gamers really want.
6787800	6788800	Absolutely.
6788800	6789800	All right.
6789800	6794000	Yeah, when he's not partying in his, you know, yacht.
6794000	6798320	Let's talk about the Xbox for a minute and their games on demand service.
6798320	6801560	Of course, you can buy full games through the games on demand service and download them
6801560	6802920	to your hard drive.
6802920	6804860	Usually these are games that have been out for a little while.
6804860	6808920	You don't see a lot of stuff that comes out like as they're new, but this is interesting.
6808920	6815220	Cave is going to be releasing Death Smiles 2X directly to games on demand.
6815220	6818280	There will not be a disc release in North America.
6818280	6821740	The game will cost $30, excuse me, $29.99.
6821740	6822960	They're not translating it.
6822960	6824600	It's going to be straight up in Japanese.
6824600	6828920	You are buying basically the import game, but playable on your Xbox 360 through games
6828920	6830040	on demand.
6830040	6833040	But because it's a shooter game, it's not like you need to have a real thorough knowledge
6833040	6834040	of Japanese.
6834040	6836320	You have to have no knowledge of Japanese, seriously.
6836320	6839960	It's going to launch Tuesday, May 17th.
6839960	6841920	Facebook is where they announced this.
6841920	6843240	Boy, what a sign of the times.
6843240	6847720	Cave announced this on Facebook saying, quote, it will be giving this format a try for getting
6847720	6851320	some of our Japan-only shooters released overseas.
6851320	6856120	I have to be honest, it's kind of a neat idea.
6856120	6859760	Like, you know, there's a lot of people that really like import games and would like to
6859760	6864400	be playing them, and it sucks that the Xbox is region-locked the way it is.
6864400	6868600	And import games are fucking expensive, so $30 for a game like that, even if they aren't
6868600	6875320	doing any translations whatsoever, it's awesome because you're saving yourself, you know,
6875320	6880800	probably about, you know, 50% of the cost of an import.
6880800	6881800	I think...
6881800	6882900	Actually more than that, probably.
6882900	6887280	This would actually kind of discourage some of the hacking, because sometimes people hack
6887280	6889760	their systems to play import games.
6889760	6893560	That's the reason why I hacked my original PlayStation 1.
6893560	6896560	So there you go.
6896560	6897560	Interesting.
6897560	6898600	I...
6898600	6900240	Maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale, eventually.
6900240	6902040	$30, I don't know, I never...
6902040	6904000	I'm not, like, super good at shooters.
6904000	6905760	Also, you know what's interesting about this?
6905760	6908860	By not getting a disc release, you won't be able to get it through Gamefly or anything
6908860	6913120	like that, or Rental, and you have to either pay the 30 bucks or don't play.
6913120	6915520	We'll see how well that goes over.
6915520	6918800	Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
6918800	6922840	Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6922840	6927360	DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out a few emails that she says,
6927360	6933040	hey, you guys should be reading, er, you guys should be, er, writing us more emails.
6933040	6934040	First email.
6934040	6935040	First email.
6935040	6939360	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here with a question for you all.
6939360	6943040	After having done this radio show for a long time, do you ever get that itch to work closer
6943040	6944040	to the video game industry?
6944040	6945040	No, not at all.
6945040	6946040	Not at all.
6946040	6949320	I mean, I know that Loki works in distribution, but do any of you feel like you would enjoy
6949320	6954120	having a hand in a game's development rather than simply reporting the news and your opinions?
6954120	6958200	Or do you prefer to stay at arm's length and pay no mind to the man behind the curtain?
6958200	6959200	Absolutely.
6959200	6963380	And I've already pitched, you know, or I've already pitched the idea that I want to pitch
6963380	6969080	an idea to Konami to, you know, it's tough actually going up to them and saying, listen,
6969080	6972920	I want to fix your franchise because they don't really take kindly to that kind of stuff.
6972920	6978640	But re-imagine and modernize a franchise, I suppose, would be the better way to do it.
6978640	6979960	But yeah, I'd love to do that.
6979960	6983280	But at the same time, you know, I have a day job, so it'd be kind of hard to quit a day
6983280	6987280	job to go work on a game.
6987280	6991560	And God knows they're not going to actually listen to one person that has an idea about
6991560	6996600	how they can improve a certain franchise because I'm sure they get thousands of emails from
6996600	6999080	people that do, you know, something very similar.
6999080	7004140	But if they were ballsy and wanted to take a chance, that'd be pretty cool.
7004140	7006240	It's a question that's bugged me for a long time as well.
7006240	7010040	I finally decided to take the plunge and leave my steady e-commerce job for a spot in the
7010040	7015440	games industry as a programmer for GameSpyTech, who support matchmaking and other online infrastructure
7015440	7019620	for games such as Command & Conquer, Pokemon Black & White, Crysis 2, and most recently
7019620	7020940	Mortal Kombat.
7020940	7024180	My fear is that I'll become jaded to video games or just not be able to keep up with
7024180	7028160	the crazy hours that I've heard you need to put in to make it in the industry.
7028160	7029940	So OLR men and women, what are your thoughts?
7029940	7034040	Are you content to admire the industry from afar or do you want to dive into the trenches?
7034040	7038360	Yours truly is EHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient and general grammar advocate.
7038360	7042200	P.S. have started a scientific poll on my Facebook to prove that everyone appreciates
7042200	7043200	boobs.
7043200	7047960	Aside from the insignificant outliner data, the results support OLR's hypothesis.
7047960	7051840	Feel free to share it in chat so that I can obtain more data and I will copy it into chat.
7051840	7052840	There you go.
7052840	7064120	So I actually, if certain things require a relocation on our part, I'm planning on applying
7064120	7069280	with Valve, Nintendo, and Microsoft because what I want to do is publication.
7069280	7074240	Gee, I wonder if she might be thinking of relocating too.
7074240	7081140	I'm wanting to do publication, like manuals, advertising, anything that's going to go into
7081140	7084640	a digital or physical print.
7084640	7086640	I have to admit, I'm a little torn on it.
7086640	7088680	I honestly have to say no.
7088680	7091440	I don't think there's a lot I could contribute on the front lines.
7091440	7092440	I'm not a programmer.
7092440	7093440	I'm not an artist.
7093440	7096720	Sure, I have ideas about games, but you know what?
7096720	7099600	Some people kind of do it a little bit better and I'm okay with that.
7099600	7104040	I would have no problem being an advisor, a tracker, hell, having done this show as
7104040	7108080	long as I have, I think I could probably get away with being some type of games analyst.
7108080	7110680	But at the same time, I have a day job I rather enjoy.
7110680	7112760	I make a decent amount of money.
7112760	7116320	I don't really see myself leaving at any time soon.
7116320	7121240	However, I'm not going to lie, especially from the journalism ends of things, if I ever
7121240	7127000	had the opportunity to host a show about games, especially on TV, although there's such little
7127000	7131080	demand for that, I don't know how that would ever happen, I would jump at that opportunity
7131080	7132600	in a heartbeat, absolutely.
7132600	7135280	Although I worry I'm starting to get a little old for that.
7135280	7140600	A lot of that stuff is targeted towards 20-somethings and teens and now I'm starting to enter my
7140600	7141600	mid thirties.
7141600	7144680	So I don't know if I would really be wanted for that.
7144680	7148440	I would tell you what I would love, love, love to do more than anything.
7148440	7153880	I would love to host a game show as especially like a throwback to the old Starrcade.
7153880	7155560	Because Rob's hero is Bob Barker.
7155560	7157760	Even something like Nick Arcade or something like that.
7157760	7158760	You want to be painted orange.
7158760	7163920	I love Bob Barker, but I also love Jean Rayburn from old seventies match game.
7163920	7164920	Like I would say.
7164920	7167040	You know who my person is?
7167040	7168040	Dude from Press Your Luck.
7168040	7169040	Oh, Peter Tamarkin.
7169040	7170040	Tamarkin.
7170040	7171040	Tamarkin.
7171040	7172040	Tamarkin.
7172040	7177280	So yeah, I would absolutely leave my day job in a heartbeat to go be a game show host.
7177280	7183120	In fact, I actually had an old boss who thought she heard of some TV station casting for who
7183120	7187220	wants to be a game show host, and she told me I could take leave from work to participate
7187220	7188220	in that show.
7188220	7190440	And she said that it's possible to be arranged.
7190440	7193160	Unfortunately that show didn't turn out to be legit, but if they ever had something like
7193160	7196120	that, I'd go on in a heartbeat, absolutely.
7196120	7201280	But at the same time, we've been doing Orange on the Radio as a hobby for nine years now.
7201280	7202680	And just radio in general.
7202680	7206640	I was on Understation Live before that and was doing college radio before that.
7206640	7210300	Like the radio industry especially is highly competitive.
7210300	7213760	And I kind of like the fact that we get to do radio on our own terms.
7213760	7216040	Yeah, we're not the biggest show out there.
7216040	7219580	A lot of people, even after nine years, have no idea who the fuck we are.
7219580	7223980	But nobody gets between me and you, the listener.
7223980	7225480	Nobody gets between that.
7225480	7227120	Nobody tells us how to do our show but us.
7227120	7229920	Nobody gets between Rob and his Calvin Klein's.
7229920	7230920	And that.
7230920	7235000	But like literally, no one tells us what to do.
7235000	7239960	And unfortunately when you go commercial for that, you lose a lot of that.
7239960	7240960	Yeah.
7240960	7243840	And so I don't know how much of that I'd be willing to give up.
7243840	7247560	If ever we took any kind of sponsorship, it'd still have to be on our terms.
7247560	7248560	Absolutely.
7248560	7250220	Which is why we'll probably be independent forever.
7250220	7256000	But that's, I think it's the way at least ye small but loyal few like it.
7256000	7258200	And that's how we roll.
7258200	7259200	That and we have Shermie.
7259200	7262160	That's where we all, we'll always have Shermie.
7262160	7263160	Yeah.
7263160	7264160	So.
7264160	7265160	Dances would sell out.
7265160	7268600	I think he's full of crap.
7268600	7269600	I don't know.
7269600	7275260	Like I just, I think it's unrealistic to think like, oh, suddenly big name gaming website
7275260	7278140	dot com wants to buy OLR as their official show.
7278140	7282320	Like I think we'd be really stupid and naive to think something like that would actually
7282320	7283320	happen.
7283320	7286620	I, I just, we've been, I totally think it's going to happen.
7286620	7290400	If it was going to happen, it would have happened in 2006 when podcasting first broke.
7290400	7295000	If it had happened and you guys didn't take the money, I would kill all three of you.
7295000	7296000	Hold on, hold on.
7296000	7297000	Dan, Dan, say that on the mic.
7297000	7301500	I think he might've got picked up, but, uh, my husband likes to just come in here and
7301500	7302500	shout things.
7302500	7304320	He said, if we didn't take the money, he'd kill all of us.
7304320	7306200	Um, I, I will say this though.
7306200	7310900	There's definitely, I think, I think one thing we always want to make sure we do here at
7310900	7314100	orange launch rate is we don't want to rest on our laurels too much.
7314100	7318540	And I think if there's ways we can push things forward and push ourselves more and push the
7318540	7321020	hobby forward, we're going to try and do that.
7321020	7326120	So I'm not saying anything, but trust me, we're always thinking about how can things
7326120	7329300	be even better than they are right now?
7329300	7336380	But on our terms, very important on our terms.
7336380	7338020	Yes.
7338020	7339020	Next email.
7339020	7340020	Yes.
7340020	7343020	Destructoid article that's linked by Rob-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.
7343020	7345820	I was getting my b-b-b-b's ready.
7345820	7348980	Originally scheduled for launch sometime this month, Nintendo has pushed back the already
7348980	7353420	late release because it should have been ready when the damn system was out of the 3DS eShop
7353420	7354420	until June.
7354420	7357700	According to the company, North America will get it June 6th and Japan will get it June
7357700	7358700	7th.
7358700	7359700	So hey, we get it first.
7359700	7360700	Neener.
7360700	7363220	Well, technically it's sort of at the same time.
7363220	7368140	I was emailing a friend about this and I also mentioned the big three addresses by Microsoft,
7368140	7369780	Sony and Nintendo respectively.
7369780	7376740	I realized that the eShop will open the day Microsoft and Sony talk, open on the day Microsoft
7376740	7379260	and Sony talk June 6th, USA, June 7th, Japan.
7379260	7380260	How clever.
7380260	7383900	Rob-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.
7383900	7385240	Last two emails.
7385240	7387500	I'm glad they finally got it back up.
7387500	7390180	This is called thoughts on PSN.
7390180	7392180	They got it up.
7392180	7397100	While it's still unclear if their security was up to standard before, I'm confident
7397100	7399420	slash hopeful it will be now.
7399420	7401400	Another incident like this would be devastating.
7401400	7404620	On the other hand, once it's fully up and running, many gamers will be quick to simply
7404620	7406580	go back to their favorite games.
7406580	7410220	Personally, I had other options so I didn't feel very put out when it was done.
7410220	7411220	Same here.
7411220	7415540	And got a bit lucky that I picked up Portal 2 and had it linked and downloaded to Steam
7415540	7418140	before the disaster.
7418140	7422980	Michael Pacher did a 24 plus minute video on how this will impact Sony.
7422980	7424300	A very interesting watch.
7424300	7428780	He certainly feels that while they lost money slash sales, they'll be fine.
7428780	7431040	Here's the link and I will copy it in the chat room.
7431040	7437580	But for those listening, it's game trailers dot com slash video slash episode dash 215
7437580	7438580	dash patch.
7438580	7441400	I guess P-A-C-H is how it's written on there.
7441400	7444500	Dash attack slash seven one three nine zero zero.
7444500	7447260	So they're giving the analysts video time now too.
7447260	7450980	I assume if you just go to game trailers dot com and search for his name you'll find it.
7450980	7454020	Well yeah, but I'm thorough.
7454020	7458580	I don't want to be a hater, but how is this guy any different from the indie podcast out
7458580	7460400	there and all the speculation they do?
7460400	7462260	Like I realize maybe he went to school or whatever.
7462260	7466540	I got played by Morgan, what was it, uh, Webb Brish or whatever.
7466540	7468200	I'm really not trying to be a hater.
7468200	7471620	Like everybody's gotta make a living, I get that, but I don't, like, why is his opinion
7471620	7472620	so important?
7472620	7473620	Dude, the guy is wrong.
7473620	7475980	More times than he's right.
7475980	7477980	And no one seems to remember that.
7477980	7478980	I'm just reading the email.
7478980	7479980	No, I know, I know.
7479980	7480980	I'm responding to the email.
7480980	7481980	Take care.
7481980	7482980	Listen to the podcast every week.
7482980	7483980	Keep up the good work.
7483980	7484980	And it's from Sepwin.
7484980	7487540	I will say this though, I actually, I do kind of agree.
7487540	7489940	I think Sony is going to recover from it in the long run.
7489940	7492580	Um, I think they're going to feel a lot of hurt.
7492580	7496380	And the real question might be, is Sony going to find this worth it to do it all over again
7496380	7497940	with PlayStation 4?
7497940	7501700	Uh, but I think at the end of the day, yes.
7501700	7507700	I think, I think they will recover if Apple recovered from the antenna thing, if Microsoft
7507700	7511940	recovered from the red ring thing, if you know, they'll, they'll come back.
7511940	7512940	It's Sony.
7512940	7516860	Do you know they've already got a business, they've already adjusted their business model
7516860	7517860	to accommodate.
7517860	7526500	Also, uh, Bobby, did you know that PSN is back up and did you know that it still does
7526500	7527820	not deliver tacos?
7527820	7528820	I am sad.
7528820	7532060	All caps, brown face, all caps, Bobby.
7532060	7533060	I had to yell.
7533060	7537380	That possibly is the best email ever actually.
7537380	7538380	That is very sad.
7538380	7539380	How was my caps lock voice?
7539380	7542020	I want tacos as part of my PlayStation severance package.
7542020	7543020	Can we get on that?
7543020	7544580	I only got four emails, Rob.
7544580	7546260	Well, we need more emails.
7546260	7547260	No talk.
7547260	7549980	That's why you didn't get tacos tonight.
7549980	7553540	Send me more emails so that Rob will get me another taco.
7553540	7557540	Send me emails so that dark soccer buys me a taco.
7557540	7562100	I'll buy you a taco if you buy me a taco.
7562100	7564380	Dan says he's going to make tacos next week.
7564380	7565380	Awesome.
7565380	7566380	Rad.
7566380	7569000	All right, we're almost to the Skype line.
7569000	7570860	Not just yet, but we will be there in just a moment.
7570860	7574460	One eight seven seven game O L R or I use your name on Skype is orange lounge radio,
7574460	7577660	but first two more stories for you.
7577660	7579060	Mm hmm.
7579060	7584620	Um, so this is kind of neat though there, you know, as part of like the Xbox indie service,
7584620	7588900	it's been very unpredictable when games are going to be released on there.
7588900	7593240	It's kind of like, well, they're up for review now, so, uh, it should be out hopefully soon.
7593240	7598180	Well now actual indie studios can pick their publishing dates.
7598180	7604860	Apparently, um, they will allow, um, people to be able to market their games actually
7604860	7610780	have some sort of, um, set release date once it's past peer review.
7610780	7613540	And um, that's kind of neat I guess.
7613540	7619700	And I guess, uh, you know, such like events like the indie games winter uprising will
7619700	7627220	be more coordinated and, uh, you know, cause I guess some of their titles were, um, missed
7627220	7631140	on that because of the release date whole thing.
7631140	7637700	Um, uh, they're saying also it's kind of a mixed to positive, um, feedback according
7637700	7639380	to the development community.
7639380	7645580	Um, some people like the decision and then, uh, saying that the chance to schedule a release
7645580	7648260	helps them plan the game promotion more sensibly.
7648260	7653180	Others noted that scheduling would, uh, likely lead to an open stampede to release on specific
7653180	7660260	days like Friday and a game of chicken trying to figure out, uh, the best time.
7660260	7664540	I think that's not really going to be an issue, but it's still kind of neat.
7664540	7668140	Uh, just a note for our live listeners, yeah, we're aware it looks like the stream is skipping
7668140	7669140	a little bit.
7669140	7671820	Anyway, looking at the upload numbers, it looks okay now.
7671820	7676540	It's not stalling like it was, but everybody in the studio make sure all your excess transmits
7676540	7678340	are turned off cause we're skipping right now.
7678340	7679940	It's having trouble uploading everything.
7679940	7683020	It looks like we're okay right now looking at the numbers, but we were having a skippy
7683020	7684740	period for a minute there.
7684740	7688500	Anyhow, um, moving on, but otherwise there's not a lot we can do about it.
7688500	7690880	If the cable's not going to cooperate, then it's not going to cooperate.
7690880	7694900	So we move on with one last story here tonight before we go to the Skype line, which if we're
7694900	7697500	still skipping is really going to be a hoot and holler tonight.
7697500	7701700	Uh, this is about Chrono Trigger, which funny enough Dark Soccer brought up earlier in the
7701700	7702700	show.
7702700	7703700	Chrono Trigger, guess what?
7703700	7705340	It's coming out on Virtual Console.
7705340	7710100	So if you do not own the Super Nintendo cartridge or you don't want to pay $70 for it or however
7710100	7714660	much it goes for on eBay these days, you'll be able to pick up your copy on May 16th.
7714660	7719060	Uh, don't know exactly how much, that's tomorrow, shit, probably by the time most of you are
7719060	7720060	hearing this show.
7720060	7721060	Uh, it's not online.
7721060	7723060	If we hadn't learned that, are we?
7723060	7728660	Uh, anyhow, uh, it's just a straight up release of the Super Nintendo version, so don't expect
7728660	7730500	anything fabulous to be changed.
7730500	7733740	That means you're not going to have the extra dungeons and stuff in the DS version, but
7733740	7734740	there you go.
7734740	7735740	It is coming out.
7735740	7739500	No price announced yet, but everybody is speculating it will be 900 Wii Points.
7739500	7744660	800 for a Super Nintendo game and that 100 point premium for the special of the special
7744660	7747700	games, which honestly Chrono Trigger, it's probably worth it.
7747700	7750340	So, uh, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people checking that out.
7750340	7753900	And especially like if you were too young to remember Chrono Trigger, just never got
7753900	7757140	a chance to play it back in the day, you really should check it out.
7757140	7761460	Like I know, I know I sometimes hate on it on the show cause I don't think it's the best
7761460	7767140	Super Nintendo RPG, but, cause I just, I love Final Fantasy 3 too god damn much, but, or
7767140	7768820	6, whatever you want to call it.
7768820	7770860	But uh, it's, it's really good.
7770860	7771860	It's really good.
7771860	7772860	You want to know what's great?
7772860	7773860	Huh?
7773860	7780700	Now keep in mind that I got the game in 95, 96 when it came out for, well, first of all,
7780700	7782820	my friend loaned it to me and then he moved.
7782820	7785540	Um, my save file is still intact.
7785540	7786540	Oh wow.
7786540	7787540	Yeah.
7787540	7791980	Well, you know, a lot about those batteries were only ever guaranteed to last five years,
7791980	7795180	but most people I know with old NES cartridges, those things still work.
7795180	7796180	Yeah.
7796180	7797180	It's just a lithium battery.
7797180	7798180	It depends on how much you used it.
7798180	7799180	Yeah.
7799180	7801180	I mean, if you, as long as you don't have the game on 24 seven.
7801180	7802180	Yeah.
7802180	7803180	So interesting.
7803180	7804180	Interesting.
7804180	7807820	Now our Saturn batteries, however, have burned and burned and burned and burned.
7807820	7808820	All right.
7808820	7812860	We are going to now open the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username
7812860	7814220	on Skype is orange launch radio.
7814220	7818700	I'm going to really hope our live transmit issues don't get in the way, but the sky,
7818700	7823500	excuse me, hiccups, the Skype radio's worst enemy, uh, the Skype line is now open for
7823500	7824500	your calls.
7824500	7827780	If you want to give feedback on any of tonight's topics or anything else that might be on your
7827780	7828780	mind, look at that.
7828780	7829900	It's already ringing.
7829900	7833780	We will of course also go to look you as some last minute stories in between calls higher
7833780	7834780	on orange launch radio.
7834780	7835780	Who's this?
7835780	7836780	It's the one and only Ron.
7836780	7837780	How's everyone?
7837780	7838780	Who else gets in first on this show?
7838780	7839780	How are you?
7839780	7840780	Rama?
7840780	7841780	I'm pretty good.
7841780	7842780	I'm pretty, pretty happy.
7842780	7843780	That's all.
7843780	7844780	You're happy.
7844780	7845780	Why are you happy?
7845780	7846780	There's no start a new job.
7846780	7847780	Come tomorrow.
7847780	7848780	Oh, well that's a reason to be happy.
7848780	7849780	Congratulations.
7849780	7850780	Thank you.
7850780	7851780	What kind of job are you going to be doing?
7851780	7854820	If you don't mind me asking, I'll still be doing tech support in the school district,
7854820	7858540	but with a different company with a lot more pay and better benefits.
7858540	7861180	Well, more pay and better benefits are always a good thing.
7861180	7862180	Congrats.
7862180	7863180	Thanks.
7863180	7864180	Awesome.
7864180	7865180	So what's in your mind tonight gaming wise?
7865180	7866180	Oh, a couple of things.
7866180	7870980	I wanted to kind of finish up what I was trying to talk about last week about Nintendo and
7870980	7872540	their touchscreen controllers.
7872540	7873540	Yeah.
7873540	7877900	I could tell you that they won't be that expensive because touchscreens are not that expensive
7877900	7878900	per se.
7878900	7882540	It's the software that powers it that makes it more expensive.
7882540	7886460	What I see is it's probably like a simple controller with a touchscreen in the middle
7886460	7891260	of it preset for certain buttons to do certain things in according to the way the game is
7891260	7892380	going to be.
7892380	7893580	I can actually agree with that.
7893580	7896420	It seems like almost everything has a touchscreen in this day and age.
7896420	7899580	Like pretty much every smartphone these days has one.
7899580	7903020	Like I was talking about earlier when we were talking about the Nintendo, the new Nintendo
7903020	7909780	console in the first place, the touchscreens on the printer devices, those things.
7909780	7910780	Yeah.
7910780	7911780	I've seen those.
7911780	7912780	Yeah.
7912780	7914700	I don't think the touchscreens will be that expensive.
7914700	7918660	It's just, you know, all this other stuff too, you know?
7918660	7920020	Pretty much.
7920020	7923140	So what do you, what are your expectations for the new Nintendo console?
7923140	7925860	We are only three weeks away from E3.
7925860	7931940	They're saying it's going to be on par with the 360 and the PS3.
7931940	7937060	Just show me what it can do and what, and the features.
7937060	7938060	That's it.
7938060	7940260	I'm a very simple person with basic needs.
7940260	7943860	I mean, if there's going to be some great gaming on it, I will pick up the console.
7943860	7951300	If it's going to be the Wii 2nd gen with more shovelware, it can stay on the shelf and collect
7951300	7952860	more dust.
7952860	7958380	Well, you know the golden rule of OLR, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
7958380	7959380	Yes, indeed.
7959380	7961060	That's the problem with the 3DS right now too.
7961060	7964620	You know I left my 3DS here after the show last week and never bothered to come get it.
7964620	7965620	Well, actually that's a lie.
7965620	7967260	I did try to come by Monday, but nobody was here.
7967260	7969260	So, because I was in the neighborhood.
7969260	7970260	But yeah.
7970260	7971260	Quite understandable.
7971260	7973260	I didn't really miss it that much.
7973260	7977420	I took mine out of my bag because I didn't like lugging it back and forth around because
7977420	7978420	I'm not using it.
7978420	7980220	Now I have no one to street pass with.
7980220	7982220	Oh, darn.
7982220	7983220	You're going to street pass with me.
7983220	7984220	Take it to E3.
7984220	7986500	Try to street pass with people there.
7986500	7987500	You're going to loiter outside E3?
7987500	7988500	Bobby will street pass with me.
7988500	7992100	Yeah, I'm going to loiter outside E3 just to street pass.
7992100	7994440	I'm just going to walk around with a big cardboard sign.
7994440	7995620	I should do this.
7995620	7997260	Big cardboard sign.
7997260	7999780	Media not good enough to get into E3.
7999780	8001780	Please street pass with me.
8001780	8004780	That would be fun.
8004780	8005780	Wow.
8005780	8006780	Anyhow.
8006780	8010780	Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?
8010780	8014780	Yes, in regards to PAX East 2012.
8014780	8015780	Yes.
8015780	8016780	Okay.
8016780	8022380	I expect this to be announced soon, but I don't know if you know, but next year PAX
8022380	8025180	East is the same weekend as Anime Boston.
8025180	8026180	Oh, snap.
8026180	8027180	City of City.
8027180	8028940	Two separate convention centers.
8028940	8029940	Oh my god.
8029940	8030940	Yeah.
8030940	8034860	That's going to be a mess.
8034860	8036420	That is bad planning.
8036420	8037420	I'm sorry.
8037420	8039420	That is bad planning.
8039420	8046260	Yeah, I know, but the problem is sometimes when these convention centers have these dates,
8046260	8048220	it's like take it or leave it, you know?
8048220	8052920	So that's probably what it boiled down to.
8052920	8054180	But here's the thing.
8054180	8059380	This was announced at Anime Boston's Masquerade, and I actually talked to a few people that
8059380	8063820	are staff and that was there that actually verified this, but it will not surprise me
8063820	8065520	if this changes.
8065520	8071700	They made the announcement that if you purchase a pass for Anime Boston 2012, it is good for
8071700	8076900	entrance to PAX East 2012 as well, and they will have shuttle buses going between both
8076900	8079740	convention centers.
8079740	8085020	That's a little weird to me considering the attendance caps that PAX keeps hitting.
8085020	8090220	Like why would you want to, you know, because if everybody who goes to Anime Boston gets
8090220	8094900	a free pass into PAX, that's less people that can go to PAX.
8094900	8100220	So that seems like, if I were on the PAX, I wouldn't agree to that if I were behind
8100220	8101220	that show.
8101220	8105860	I figure it's like, you know, you got so many gamers going to this convention, you got so
8105860	8110420	many anime fans going to this convention, give them a free pass, check out the other
8110420	8111420	side per se.
8111420	8115660	Well then why not, is the other half going to be true too?
8115660	8117820	It would not surprise me if it is.
8117820	8121980	But correct me if I'm wrong, Anime Boston is going to be at the old convention center,
8121980	8122980	the Heinz, right?
8122980	8123980	Yes.
8123980	8127940	And then the Uber one that PAX is at this year is where PAX will be.
8127940	8131500	What if everybody decides to go to Anime Boston one of those days, I mean that Heinz place
8131500	8133500	is going to collapse?
8133500	8139860	Honestly, with the numbers that PAX East generates, I find that hard to believe because I'm planning
8139860	8141820	to do PAX East instead.
8141820	8148020	And knowing how some fans are, how lazy they can be per se, no offense, but to be perfectly
8148020	8152800	honest, I don't think a lot of them are going to take shuttle buses to go 15 minutes across
8152800	8155100	town to another convention and then come back.
8155100	8158620	One of the two needs to move, end of story, one of the two needs to move.
8158620	8160580	They shouldn't be the same weekend.
8160580	8165140	I know, but this is what I'm hearing from a lot of my sources, that this could be the
8165140	8167220	end for AB, who knows?
8167220	8170560	Well then move, you know?
8170560	8173220	I don't know, that's going to be tricky.
8173220	8175940	It's going to be an interesting weekend next year.
8175940	8179500	I know, I am curiously seeing how this is all going to play out.
8179500	8184100	It's still a long ways away all things considered, so some things may change, we'll see.
8184100	8187020	I don't doubt your sources, but I'm still skeptical.
8187020	8190340	It seems like wishful thinking on Anime Boston's part.
8190340	8194100	I know, it wouldn't surprise me as if AB says this is what they're going to do.
8194100	8198180	Wouldn't surprise me if PAX comes out and says, yeah, you buy one of our badges, it's
8198180	8199180	not good for AB.
8199180	8205620	Maybe they're trying to be all buddy-buddy, friendly-friendly, because you have two different
8205620	8210340	convention companies in the same town fighting for top dog, or in this case, a one-legged
8210340	8211340	ass-kicking contest.
8211340	8215680	Yeah, and I was going to say, you'd think in most situations the two would be fighting
8215680	8221380	each other, but I'm sorry Anime fans, PAX, with the people that come as far away as they
8221380	8226620	do, you know, all the way from like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and all like the southern
8226620	8231220	East States, you know, because that's still the closest thing they've got, I'm sorry,
8231220	8234580	Anime Boston's going to get their ass handed to them if they stay that same weekend.
8234580	8238160	And you're absolutely right, but the funny thing is, there are people that travel as
8238160	8241780	far south as Florida and Texas that come up to Anime Boston.
8241780	8242780	Why do they do it?
8242780	8243780	For the guests.
8243780	8247620	But for next year, you may travel way across the country for the guests, but as for me,
8247620	8250500	I'll travel way across the country to check out these great games.
8250500	8251500	Yeah.
8251500	8252500	True.
8252500	8253500	True.
8253500	8254500	All right.
8254500	8255500	Yes.
8255500	8256500	We gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much, buddy.
8256500	8257500	Hey, no problem, dude.
8257500	8258500	Take care.
8258500	8259500	Bye.
8259500	8260500	All right.
8260500	8261500	Later.
8261500	8262500	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us
8262500	8263500	a call.
8263500	8264700	Uh, Loki, any last minute stories while we wait for a call?
8264700	8266220	Yeah, there's some weird stuff.
8266220	8267940	Um, this is kind of funny.
8267940	8270380	I don't know if you remember the game YouStar2.
8270380	8276180	It was kind of like a karaoke sort of game where you reenact scenes for movies and stuff
8276180	8277180	like that.
8277180	8278180	Looked dumb.
8278180	8279380	Yes, it was terrible, actually.
8279380	8283900	I've played it, but there's some free download content coming out, and guess what it ties
8283900	8284900	into?
8284900	8285900	What?
8285900	8286900	The Royal Wedding.
8286900	8287900	That's ridiculous.
8287900	8291140	Yes, it will allow players to replace either Prince William or Kate Milton, so you could
8291140	8292140	do a...
8292140	8293140	Wait, I can be Princess Kate?
8293140	8294500	You can be Princess Kate, yes.
8294500	8295500	I mean, he's actually...
8295500	8298980	In their first public kiss following the Royal Wedding.
8298980	8299980	Wow.
8299980	8301260	It says the scene's offered free.
8301260	8303820	Clearly, I attempt to subvert otherwise rational people.
8303820	8305300	I'm not sure how I feel about that.
8305300	8306300	Let's go back to the phones.
8306300	8307300	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8307300	8308300	Who's this?
8308300	8310060	Oh, I thought I had a call.
8310060	8311060	I guess not.
8311060	8312060	I guess I missed it.
8312060	8313060	Sorry.
8313060	8314060	Keep going.
8314060	8317380	Um, so yeah, apparently there's gonna be some other footage and stuff that's available.
8317380	8320340	But seriously, though, I've played USAR 2.
8320340	8325740	It's a cool concept, but it's so terribly executed.
8325740	8326980	It's such a terrible game.
8326980	8330780	My favorite is how the camera cannot frame you properly.
8330780	8335940	I remember my coworker playing it, though.
8335940	8339900	He's just like, he's doing this scene and it's framed so his head's at the very bottom
8339900	8340900	of the screen.
8340900	8341900	It's hilarious.
8341900	8342900	Alright, let me go to the phones.
8342900	8343900	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8343900	8344900	Who's this?
8344900	8345900	It's Death Wishing.
8345900	8347780	Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
8347780	8353300	I'm playing a very amazing gem of a game that people need to start playing again.
8353300	8354300	What's that?
8354300	8355300	Freelancer.
8355300	8358380	I have not even think I've heard of this.
8358380	8359380	What is this game?
8359380	8368460	It's a PC game from 2004, I believe, and it's kind of say, like, Eve Online, minus being
8368460	8369460	an MMORPG.
8369460	8373580	But you can play it with, like, 200 people online at once, and you do missions.
8373580	8376940	Think, like, Neverwinter Nights kind of style, you know, you can do missions and stuff, all
8376940	8377940	that, but it's space combat.
8377940	8378940	Oh, yeah, okay.
8378940	8381940	It's pretty fun.
8381940	8393020	Anyways, that Nintendo thing, I'm kind of looking, I'm totally seeing fail in the future.
8393020	8394020	Why so negative?
8394020	8399180	Well, it's like, they're saying, oh, it's going to be, like, on par with PS3, Xbox 360,
8399180	8402300	but then you see the thing about, oh, we're going to be inventing some new peripheral
8402300	8406620	where you can, like, feel things, I'm like, oh, great, so now we're going to have a bunch
8406620	8409620	of games instead of playing Wii Tennis, we're going to be playing Wii Tennis where we can
8409620	8411780	feel like we're holding the ball, or...
8411780	8415580	I kind of think the feel thing is bullshit.
8415580	8419200	I truly think the feel thing is bullshit, that's not coming from the same source that
8419200	8424320	originally leaked the news about the Nintendo Wii Next system and the whole, that came from
8424320	8425320	a different source.
8425320	8428920	I really think the feel, I think the feel stuff holds about as much weight as the fact
8428920	8436300	that the revolution was going to project 3D graphics, remember that?
8436300	8440940	So yes, I think there's a new Nintendo system, yes, I think the controller does have some
8440940	8445100	type of video screen that probably has a touch on it, or at least some type of touch, I mean,
8445100	8450740	who's to say that feel isn't just the fact that you're touching a screen?
8450740	8455180	You know, that's still feel, it doesn't mean that you're getting that tactile response
8455180	8461260	of, like, feeling snakeskin and petting a snake, so I don't know, I kind of think the
8461260	8467900	whole, like, touch, I think that's just, like, weird, crazy fanboy bullshit, I truly do.
8467900	8476580	Um, sorry, so I'm going down here, over here, uh, I bet you don't frickin' tend to think
8476580	8480480	for us, it's also going to have a button that says, give Nintendo money, because anything
8480480	8485180	in there is going to put money regardless, it's going to sell, I know for a fact it will.
8485180	8486180	Well, which-
8486180	8489100	They got the soccer mom market on the Nintendo Wii.
8489100	8490540	Yeah, but will you buy one?
8490540	8492780	Do you own a Wii?
8492780	8498620	Uh, I owned a Wii, I had it for three months, and then I was like, wow, this is the most
8498620	8502020	gimmicky piece of crap I've ever owned, and I gave it to my cousins because I didn't want
8502020	8505140	to sell it, so I gave it to some kids, I wouldn't use it.
8505140	8508300	Do you worry you might make the same mistake with the new Nintendo system?
8508300	8513820	Uh, I know I won't because I'm just going to switch to PC Master Race.
8513820	8514880	Are you sure, though?
8514880	8518180	What could Nintendo announce on this thing that would make you be like, maybe I should
8518180	8520180	get this?
8520180	8526340	Um, that they're actually going to make a new Goldeneye that isn't stupid and handle
8526340	8529420	like ass, and my ship just blew up.
8529420	8532700	Well, have fun in the PC Master Race.
8532700	8538940	Alright, alright Death Wishing, we'll be looking for your reactions after E3.
8538940	8545140	Alright, well, um, have fun with whoever's coming, like I was going to PAX East or whatever,
8545140	8547540	have fun with all the Japanese Wii, there's an anime.
8547540	8548540	We will.
8548540	8549540	Alright.
8549540	8550540	Bye.
8550540	8551540	Bye.
8551540	8555180	There's going to be some great, like, crossover interviews and things like that.
8555180	8559620	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8559620	8562620	I really think Anime Boston's going to be forced to move weekends.
8562620	8567900	I know, you know, I know there's only so much convention center space and so on, but, uh,
8567900	8570060	think outside the box, people.
8570060	8574020	Anyhow, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8574020	8577140	In the meantime, more last minute stories from Loki!
8577140	8582900	There's an NES cartridge that's being developed that will turn your NES into a MIDI synthesizer.
8582900	8589060	It's called Chip Maestro, it was actually part of a Kickstarter program, and for $50
8589060	8592940	you can grab one of these cartridges that plugs into a MIDI keyboard and you can start
8592940	8601700	creating your own 8-bit sounding music using a keyboard, it's kind of cool.
8601700	8609060	And then, of course, there is a new Xbox Live and PlayStation Network game that's been announced.
8609060	8612180	Jeremy McGrath Offroad.
8612180	8617180	No word on what the game is exactly, obviously it's going to be a Baja Racing type of game.
8617180	8622980	It's actually being developed, I guess, from the people that did Baja Edge of Control for
8622980	8628620	THQ, and I guess they've also done some work on the MX vs ATV series, so they've got a
8628620	8632820	good pedigree there, but don't really know that many details about it.
8632820	8638100	People are kind of hoping that it's maybe a spiritual successor to Ivan Ironman Stewart's
8638100	8639460	Offroad Racing game.
8639460	8640460	That game was fucking awesome.
8640460	8642500	Alright, let's go to the phones, we've got another call coming in.
8642500	8643500	1877, I'm sorry.
8643500	8645500	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8645500	8647500	You've already called the number.
8647500	8650180	Hey guys, it's CD Thunder.
8650180	8655100	CD Thunder, what's in your mind?
8655100	8658460	Well I have a couple of things to talk to you about.
8658460	8661940	Go for it.
8661940	8664180	There must be like hella lag going on here.
8664180	8665180	Go ahead.
8665180	8672900	Well, let's see, the two games I want to talk about, Perfect Dark and GoldenEye 007.
8672900	8674820	Some classic games?
8674820	8676380	Go for it.
8676380	8684820	Well, I like them both, and the Perfect Dark is basically like a space version of the GoldenEye
8684820	8688300	007, if you know what I'm talking about.
8688300	8689380	These are some old games.
8689380	8693020	These games have been out a very long time.
8693020	8696780	Are you just kind of getting around to playing classics, like rediscovering old stuff, kind
8696780	8700140	of like our last caller's playing some PC game from 2004?
8700140	8702580	Are you rediscovering classic games?
8702580	8708340	Are you finding these through the new versions of GoldenEye or Perfect Dark Zero, or what
8708340	8711340	has peaked your interest in these games?
8711340	8718100	It's GoldenEye 007, talking about that, is actually one of the games we got when we got
8718100	8721940	the Nintendo 64 for the first time.
8721940	8729420	Oh, you're the guy that called in a few weeks ago, and you just recently got a 64, right?
8729420	8735220	Actually not recently, but a few Christmases ago or something.
8735220	8738060	You don't have a lot of the new systems, right?
8738060	8739060	You play on like...
8739060	8740060	No, uh-uh.
8740060	8741060	Okay, I remember you.
8741060	8744020	All right, you've got like all the classic stuff in your house.
8744020	8745020	So you're...
8745020	8747260	Yeah, a lot of the good stuff.
8747260	8751020	You're gaming in a time capsule, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because there's
8751020	8754980	a lot of shit out there right now, and so it really gives you time to focus on the classics.
8754980	8759860	So you're kind of rediscovering a lot of these games like they're totally new, right?
8759860	8760860	Yeah.
8760860	8763100	That's pretty cool, actually.
8763100	8768020	I'd like to be living in a bubble like that sometimes, because there's a lot of real crap
8768020	8769020	out there right now.
8769020	8773380	All right, well tell us, how was it playing Perfect Dark and GoldenEye for the first time?
8773380	8778900	Well, GoldenEye I actually had a lot of fun with, I like the James Bond.
8778900	8783900	So since it was James Bond, I really liked it a lot, and well, a lot of the levels are
8783900	8787860	really difficult.
8787860	8793300	And with Perfect Dark, it's space...
8793300	8794580	Go ahead.
8794580	8796180	Oh.
8796180	8803340	And the Perfect Dark is basically like a space age version of GoldenEye 007, except he plays
8803340	8809820	a woman, and you have on-screen reloads, but in the GoldenEye 007, you have off-screen
8809820	8810820	reloads.
8810820	8812820	And the bitch can't jump.
8812820	8816660	Yeah, she can jump only a little bit.
8816660	8819680	You know, they made a new GoldenEye, in fact it's funny, I think one of the previous callers
8819680	8823740	brought this up, they made a new GoldenEye last year on the Wii, so you'll be playing
8823740	8825460	that in about 2018.
8825460	8830540	But they made this game, and a lot of people aren't really fans of it, like they say it
8830540	8833700	blows, it isn't like the original at all.
8833700	8836640	Why do you think people are so partial to the original GoldenEye?
8836640	8840820	What is the charm in the original GoldenEye?
8840820	8846780	Well because, it could be maybe because they like the movie, and because of that they like
8846780	8855420	the game, and since they remade the GoldenEye 007 on the Wii with Daniel Craig, they're
8855420	8859540	thinking it's a reboot of the original, so maybe that's one of the reasons.
8859540	8860540	Alright.
8860540	8864260	Well buddy, we're gonna let you go to take some more calls, but I'm just gonna leave
8864260	8868300	you with this, don't bother with Majora's Mask, it's not nearly as good as Ocarina of
8868300	8869300	Time.
8869300	8870300	Just so you know.
8870300	8871300	Alright.
8871300	8872300	Alright, take care buddy.
8872300	8873300	Thanks, you too.
8873300	8879900	1877 game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8879900	8885100	You know, I really do mean it, sometimes I kind of wish I could just kind of go back
8885100	8888220	in gaming, like seriously, Super Nintendo?
8888220	8893420	There's so many good games on that, I probably still have yet to play, alright.
8893420	8897580	And some folks in chatroom vehemently disagree with me, DarkToaGak in chat says, Majora's
8897580	8900660	Mask is orgasmic, what the hell is Sky talking about?
8900660	8902220	Majora's Mask was annoying.
8902220	8903220	I didn't like it.
8903220	8906940	Of course I always thought that Ocarina of Time was a little bit overrated too.
8906940	8909620	I liked Ocarina, but my favorite's Silling to the Past.
8909620	8912900	Alright, let's wrap up with last minute stories, Loki, if you had anything else.
8912900	8915220	His last minute story is Portal.
8915220	8916740	I had nothing else.
8916740	8918160	Oh okay.
8918160	8924140	And I'm getting a private message about Square Enix might be going bankrupt, and I do remember
8924140	8928660	reading the article online, I don't have it up in front of me, but I think they reported
8928660	8931240	huge losses recently.
8931240	8935540	And I assumed a lot, well I don't, like I think part of it they were trying to say might
8935540	8939700	have been the tsunami, which makes sense, you know, obviously everybody heard from that.
8939700	8946020	But I think a really large part of it that I don't think was really announced in the
8946020	8950820	story was the utter dismal cataclysmic failure of Final Fantasy XIV.
8950820	8955180	Because keep in mind, that game was supposed to come out on Playstation 3 by now, but it
8955180	8956180	hasn't.
8956180	8961980	So yeah, I think Square's probably way overestimated what they were going to make last quarter,
8961980	8965740	and I think a lot of that has to do with Final Fantasy XIV, honestly.
8965740	8969700	Oh, I'm getting more information, thank you to the person who's messaging me right now,
8969700	8974540	let me pull up this link in our little browser box here.
8974540	8977740	Oh, and of course it's all in Japanese, I can't read that.
8977740	8980980	That's why you should use Nifty.
8980980	8988420	No, I, oh yeah, I could use Nifty, hold on, or I could use Google Translate.
8988420	8992900	But Final Fantasy XIII apparently plays into this as well, Final Fantasy XIII not quite
8992900	8997780	selling as much as they thought.
8997780	9000780	I'm translating it now.
9000780	9006460	16 billion yen, extraordinary loss and damage.
9006460	9009020	The earthquake did stop them to some development.
9009020	9013620	Ah, they are attributing this to Final Fantasy XIV and postponing that.
9013620	9021220	Let's see, they're thinking though the, they say the business environment is rapidly changing.
9021220	9029100	Yeah, they do cite Final Fantasy XIV multiple times here.
9029100	9034460	Final Fantasy XI, I guess it talks about that Final Fantasy XIV wasn't the same quality
9034460	9041100	as Final Fantasy XI, and they actually apologized for the unusual situation it has become.
9041100	9042100	Yikes.
9042100	9047980	Well, I, we told you when we first reported on Final Fantasy XIV, heads were gonna roll,
9047980	9052540	so Final Fantasy XIII-2 it sounds like might be delayed too.
9052540	9055580	Good times!
9055580	9058900	Alright that's gonna do it for Last Minute Stories tonight, I think we're all done.
9058900	9062660	So this is the part we go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but first I'm gonna thank
9062660	9065740	all you guys for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight, and remember if you like what
9065740	9069580	you heard, you know, we got into this during the email bag, but we don't have big corporate
9069580	9074100	dollars behind the show, we do this just because we like having a show, hanging out with each
9074100	9077300	other and hanging out with you guys every Sunday, so tell some friends to come join
9077300	9078300	the party.
9078300	9079300	Lots of them.
9079300	9080300	Open invite.
9080300	9084260	So yeah, we hope to hear from your friends, tell a couple friends about the show, and
9084260	9088260	spread the word about Orange Launch Radio, and you can keep having the show for free.
9088260	9089660	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9089660	9092420	I'll start with the portal-loving Loki.
9092420	9093900	Your final thought tonight.
9093900	9097820	Uh, my final thought is we never did it after Use of the Week.
9097820	9098820	No we didn't.
9098820	9099820	Oh we didn't!
9099820	9101820	Shit, I guess we should do that now then, shouldn't we?
9101820	9102820	I don't care.
9102820	9103820	You don't care?
9103820	9104820	No, we can do it.
9104820	9105820	Alright, here they go.
9105820	9123700	F.U. to this little patch of Eximo on my right hand ring finger.
9123700	9124700	The end.
9124700	9125700	Loki?
9125700	9130780	F.U. to the woman that wasn't watching where she was driving and hit the back of my car.
9130780	9131780	Doh!
9131780	9134300	Um, F.U. to hangovers.
9134300	9136300	I had a bad one this morning.
9136300	9138500	Alright there you go, Loki, we did the F.U.s of the week.
9138500	9140620	Uh, my F.U. of the week, er, not my F.U.
9140620	9147620	My final thought, um, is weekend's already over and that makes me sad.
9147620	9148620	Eh.
9148620	9149620	Dark Sakura?
9149620	9154740	He who controls the spice controls the universe.
9154740	9158020	Alright that does it everybody, thank you again for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
9158020	9159780	What say we do it all again next week?
9159780	9160780	Sound good?
