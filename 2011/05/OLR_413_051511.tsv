14175	25752	Tonight, May 15, 2011, PlayStation Network returns after a three-week hiatus, a new entry in a popular fighting franchise is announced, and a classic Sega Genesis video game is localized for a new release.
31789	36013	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36053	38355	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38755	42298	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.
42378	45300	First up, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
45521	45841	Hi.
46021	46441	How are you?
47242	48183	I am accomplished.
48463	49344	You're accomplished.
49384	49944	Why is that?
50124	52506	Because I beat Portal 2 just now.
52586	53547	Congratulations.
53707	55689	I walked in like right as the ending was going on.
55709	59132	I'm not going to spoil what happens, but I was like, oh, it's this part.
59212	60193	I like this part, so...
60859	62239	I like the all of that part.
63000	63620	I figured you would.
63940	67281	Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
67461	67841	Hello.
68121	69902	Now, what is this you're eating tonight?
69982	70782	That looks burnt.
71342	76964	Yeah, they don't understand what well done means versus, you know, torch.
77244	78764	Your pizza looks burnt or dead.
78864	79625	It's certainly well done.
79785	80105	What is this?
80125	81685	Is this quadruple bacon pizza again?
81805	82605	No, it's still triple bacon.
82625	83266	Triple bacon.
83306	83826	Oh, my bad.
85046	86867	How dare I increase the bacon?
87987	90429	Anyhow, we're going to get into the show, of course.
90970	98757	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
99138	100699	It's very easy to hear the show.
100799	105444	All you do is you go to allgames.com, and as long as you have Flash installed, it comes right up.
105564	106344	So it's very easy.
106385	111189	You don't have to worry about any of those complicated, getting it into your Winamp or iTunes or whatever.
111529	112070	Very easy.
112290	113391	Rob said it, we're easy.
113551	116534	But if you want to put it in WinF and iTunes, you can do that too.
116574	118175	There's more information at allgames.com.
119696	122959	Also, our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
123459	124300	It's very important to know.
124320	125981	We don't use the normal All Games chat room.
126041	126282	Why?
126442	126782	I don't know.
126822	127663	It's just the way we've done it.
127843	129304	We've had our own chat room for like nine years.
129324	130145	Because we're Bethel.
130325	132727	Plus, we like being in charge of our own chat room.
132787	133748	So it's a power thing.
134248	139732	Anyhow, so chat.orangeslamstrator.com is where you can join us to chat with us live and give us your comments on what's going on.
140393	144816	Such as Breakman in our chat room tonight who says there is no such thing as too much bacon.
145156	149079	I don't know, I think, remember when we had the bacon party for one of your birthdays?
149599	153962	And there was like all these bacon dishes here in house, that was too much bacon, I'm sorry.
154062	157545	I have to say, actually, the smell is turning my stomach.
157899	161220	Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?
161260	162340	How was your gaming week?
187828	190690	Well, I just beat Portal 2 and I played some well.
191511	199578	And because certain people in our guild are going to be helping me run through a dungeon and learn how to tank on Rebecca Black.
200174	202155	I still love the character and I still love people's reactions
222637	224138	I played WoW WoW and more WoW.
224238	232283	I'm getting pissed off though because every time I try to play on Drenden I realize everybody's poor and nobody can give me the 300 gold I need to get flying.
232984	234005	You'll have to earn it.
235305	236886	Do herbalism and mining.
236926	237587	That's how I did it.
237607	239548	You just go collect things for a while and then sell.
239648	240149	That's how you do it.
240509	242030	Then I just need to get rid of tailoring.
243631	246873	Anyhow, I don't want to fill up too much of WoW chat because there's a whole other show for that now.
247393	248454	Anything else you've been playing this week?
251056	251276	No.
251296	251336	No.
252546	253666	See any good movies lately?
253706	256987	I see a Tron thing behind you and that made me think like, oh, Tron's on Blu-ray.
257007	259128	I'm supposed to go see Thor on Tuesday.
259488	259708	Nice.
259728	260189	With Becky.
261369	262289	Stay till after the credits.
262549	262709	I know.
262729	263550	That's what everybody says.
263790	264130	I know.
264390	264690	All right.
264950	268371	There's only one character in that whole movie I care about seeing and he's only in one part.
269812	271892	Because it's my dude.
272773	273033	All right.
273313	273893	But no spoilers.
274693	276274	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
276294	276895	What have you been playing?
277715	279436	Just really two things.
280777	283659	Portal 2 and Grand Theft Auto.
284660	291124	In Portal 2, I have Chapter 8 and Grand Theft Auto.
291144	292205	Well, it's just Grand Theft Auto.
292245	295167	We decided to start playing some grenade launcher only games, which is kind of fun.
296128	300711	But yeah, that's pretty much about it.
301775	302916	Portal 2 Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat
326631	329973	And I got my ass handed to me because I guess I'm just not good at fighters.
330033	330313	I don't know.
330333	331134	I need more practice.
331694	332215	But I was trying.
332515	333956	First match was a little laggy.
334236	336437	I was a little bit disappointed at how kind of laggy.
336457	340120	And it was one of those things where the frames per second suffer.
340240	344082	Like that's how Mortal Kombat kind of compensates for the lag is that your frames suffer.
344563	346524	But then I played another match today and it was fine.
346724	348906	It was very smooth and worked fine.
348946	351107	So I guess it really is just about who you're connecting to.
351868	354369	The service is a little bit wonky still.
355630	383698	I tried to log in today and I got the PlayStation is down for maintenance message so I did it like four times and it finally let me in so kind of weird how that's working but whatever otherwise as far as new games go there is one new game I've been playing this week and that is a downloadable game on Xbox Live I believe it's on PlayStation Network as well but you know haven't really been able to tell for the past three weeks so it's on Xbox Live Arcade it's called Might and Magic Clash of Heroes I think is what it's called it's a that's old school
384258	386661	Well, yeah, it's interesting because it's a DS game.
386761	392867	It was a DS game a few years ago, but I have kind of lost touch of the Nintendo DS scene about four years ago.
392907	396951	There just hasn't really been a lot on the DS I really wanted to play that wasn't like a first-party game.
397752	400134	But apparently this one was pretty good, and I totally missed it.
401035	406421	So it's out now on Xbox Live and apparently PlayStation Network, not that you'll be able to download that anytime soon.
407421	408842	But it's a port of the DS version.
408862	412365	And from what I understand, they've done some redone graphics and things like that.
412385	413646	But let me tell you a little bit about the game.
414146	420450	It's very much a puzzle quest, gyromancer, RPPG game.
420490	421491	Role playing puzzle game.
421931	422712	It's another one of these.
423512	428736	The battle system, if you watch somebody else play it, you're not going to understand what the hell is going on.
429096	432698	But it has a really good ramp up in the single player mode to kind of get you used to things.
432818	436101	And the best way I could explain it, it's kind of like Magical Drop.
436961	437781	Thanks for watching!
458388	458909	Thanks for watching!
479244	486510	But again, if you're into the Puzzle Quest 2 type of games where every battle is a full Bejeweled match, basically, this game is really right up that alley.
486870	494776	And I would say, I actually found the game itself, the puzzle interface, to be kind of a neat little thinker.
495376	504964	And it's something a lot different from the Bejeweled-esque games, which pretty much a lot of the other games that are out there in the RPPG series kind of fall into right now.
505664	507405	Maybe the lone exception is that...
508546	509527	Puzzle Chronicles Puzzle Quest
534199	558625	but uh yeah if you're into the puzzle games I really encourage you to check this one out because I think it would be worthy to your collection um not just a single player mode you can do Xbox Live matches I have not delved so far into that section yet so I can't say a lot but I can imagine that is definitely something that the DS version probably didn't have maybe it had it locally I don't know I could be totally misstating maybe someone shall correct me I don't know if it had internet play like I know DS has internet play
558925	560546	Xbox Live, Might Magic, Clash of Heroes
585908	588749	But DarkSakura and I are going to LA.
590349	590990	Long story.
591690	593330	So we may or may not be back that Sunday.
593391	596131	I think we're going to try and make it back in time for the show, which would be good.
596291	597192	No promises, though.
597312	598052	No promises, though.
598092	598232	Exactly.
598272	599112	So we'll let you know a little closer.
599132	600813	So you have to stop by the cheese factory on the way back.
600993	602334	That's still, what, about three weeks away?
602954	604815	So, we got a little time to figure that all out.
605956	607296	Meanwhile, join us on Facebook.
607336	608957	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
609257	610878	Twitter.com slash OLR.
611318	615341	And, of course, our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
616862	641423	Alright, let's move on I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com CD Thunder in our chatroom says RPPG means Rob playing a video game, rated PG Rob playing PG I guess my Magic Clash of Heroes would be PG I mean there's cartoony sword fights, but no blood or anything like that Me playing Mortal Kombat would definitely not be rated PG Because I giggle all the time at the fatalities
642203	644205	And I got to see the, uh, what is it called?
644626	646087	Is that called the Deadpool?
646727	651051	Like, I know that's also one of DarkSakura's favorite comic pairs, but I think that's what it's called, the acid room?
651071	653734	Okay, I saw the stage fatality for that for the first time.
654334	656636	It was gross, but I giggled.
656716	657497	It was funny.
658518	660319	I need to get my mom back over and show her that one.
660339	661520	You're supposed to bring the game over.
662221	663142	Oh, my bad, I forgot.
663442	665083	Sky and Dark Sakura are going to Hollywood.
665143	667465	I bet they are going to be in a movie.
667485	668426	What are you hiding from us?
681898	682819	Maybe, maybe not.
683459	685582	Ranma says... A YouTube movie, maybe.
686242	691588	Ranma says, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and an all-new team-up special, Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles.
692249	695373	Well, we don't want to leave Loki out of all the fun stuff, but, you know, he has the baby.
696033	696874	We can't stop here.
696914	698156	This is Activision country.
699517	700718	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
701398	703099	Gaming news, start us off, Loki.
703999	709722	So there was like a firmware update today for the PlayStation Network, yay.
709742	712783	3.61, it's basically the update that makes you change your PlayStation Network ID.
713063	714164	It was yesterday, but nobody knew.
714384	718146	Today, yesterday, who cares, it all blends together, you know, I don't really give a shit.
719106	722488	But you see, and I will say, okay.
723928	726850	According to this post, this post was made on the 14th.
727891	729372	That would be, oh, that would be yesterday.
729812	731113	Well, I don't know my days, okay?
731153	732113	So what can I say?
732814	733975	They all just blend together.
733995	735476	They all blend together, seriously.
735536	736256	What day is today?
736656	736977	I don't know.
737497	739158	Anyway, so yeah, firmware update.
740839	746141	And of course, that, of course, led to the PlayStation Network starting to come up.
746762	755345	And I love this little, very official Kaz Harai video where he's, like, making a State of a Union address or something like that.
755365	755685	Did you watch?
755765	758787	It was the blandest fucking message I've ever seen.
758847	759747	Like, how bad?
759807	763088	I'm like, I hate kicking these guys when they're down, but I was watching it.
763128	764089	I was falling asleep.
764629	769410	This is why people are drawn to Reggie Fils-Aimé from Nintendo, because you feel his enthusiasm.
769890	775792	Even when he's hawking such bullshit, like the Vitality Sensor or whatever, you at least really feel his enthusiasm.
775812	777652	I think that's why he's very popular with gamers.
778012	781533	But Kaz Hirai is very, just like, so vanilla.
782253	784073	Hello, my name is Kaz Hirai.
784153	785834	And I like to party.
788604	790365	We here at Sony embrace fun.
791005	791546	Hurrah.
792887	798730	And I know my friends over here are now enjoying the fun PlayStation Network.
799871	800931	Everybody happy.
801231	802052	Party time.
802812	805154	Fun, fun, fun, fun.
805514	807035	Yesterday was Thursday.
807515	808636	Tomorrow is Saturday.
811530	812931	Hold on, I actually want to play a little bit of this.
812951	814113	Did you watch this, DarkSakura?
814573	814853	No.
814954	817636	Tell me if this does not scream, I am a party animal.
830009	830830	What is he doing with his hands?
830870	834352	He makes these very, very distinct, like, this is the part where I'm going to clasp my hands.
834372	835953	That's because the teleprompter tells him to.
835973	836293	You think?
836333	836813	Clasp hands.
836993	838034	And now for the secret ingredient.
854065	860487	And with the money that we have lost, we're going to actually be raising a few of our rates in the next few months to pay for this new teleprompter.
861008	869811	We had to keep it on a separate network because PSN is actually still down and we're just put psychedelics into your breakfast cereal so that you'll believe it's back up.
870100	877404	No, seriously, we had to work around the clock, because some dumbass put a giant clock in her server room, and we had to work around that damn thing because we couldn't move it out of the way.
877544	882406	By we had to work around the clock, I mean everybody except me, where I went home and ate crayons.
883887	889129	I especially like the green one, because when I cough it up later on, it looks like mucus, and I can gross out my kids.
891370	893752	I don't know, it just reminded me of one of those...
898754	900576	It's really cheesy acting or something.
900676	901076	I don't know.
903058	904539	He's reading off a teleprompter.
905420	909764	Because if you look where his eyes are fixated the entire time, he's reading a teleprompter.
910765	912466	Or he's staring into your soul.
913627	914068	He can't.
914128	914929	He has no soul.
915729	918231	Only people with souls can stare at other people with souls.
919112	921034	It's in the unwritten book of souls.
921960	931885	So anyways, yeah, the PlayStation Network, the first phase, I guess leading up to the full return by the end of May, included the following services.
931985	936927	Obviously, the ability to sign into the PlayStation Network and Curiosity, including resetting the passwords.
937707	963687	Restoration of online gameplay including PlayStation 3 and PSP Playback of rental video content Music and limited services from Curiosity Access to third party services such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and MLB TV The Friends category and PlayStation Home Yes, thank god PlayStation Home was part of that I missed it so much
964567	968149	Because there's so much partying going on in PlayStation Home.
970069	977392	And then, of course, it's fully back up throughout North America, which is awesome for us.
978713	985036	And I'm just running home right now to go sign up on the PlayStation Network to change my password and play some games.
986016	987817	Oh, wait, I'm not, because I don't care.
988997	1000763	And then finally, Sony Online Entertainment announced that they're going to be offering their members a free month, which is great since it's been down for a month, and they're rewarding their players for the affected downtime.
1001364	1006967	I guess some double XP events for EverQuest and Vanguard, and they're going to be doing...
1008849	1013554	and some special gear in DC Universe and Star Wars Galaxies.
1013954	1019960	I did see, well the DC Universe one, it's like some stupid cowl thing that looks like you could be Batman or something.
1020481	1025206	And then Star Wars Galaxies, I'm surprised, I didn't even realize that was still up.
1026733	1028734	But hey, learn something.
1029194	1037198	And then finally, I guess Lifetime subscribers will get another load in, or I guess some more in-game currency.
1037538	1038578	500 station cash.
1042140	1043461	Whatever station cash is.
1045362	1046162	I'm sorry, what?
1047592	1048813	I'm sorry, you're right.
1048973	1051234	My brain shut off for that whole thing right there.
1052375	1053395	So here's what I have to say.
1054676	1057377	Not everybody's relieved to be back online and playing.
1057417	1058278	Is anyone still mad?
1058598	1061239	Because I have a feeling by next week no one's going to be mad anymore.
1061599	1062920	They're just going to be forgetting about it.
1064894	1066796	I don't know.
1068377	1076626	With E3 so close and around the corner too, this is still going to be fresh in people's minds when E3 rolls around.
1076646	1079388	And that's one of the disadvantages that Sony's going into this with.
1079448	1079669	I mean...
1080229	1103056	and you can say that the Red Ring of Death thing was a big debacle too but you know remember Microsoft kind of finally it took them long enough but they kind of you know came out and admitted fault for that and they were generally able to get over that whole thing whereas I don't know this is still really fresh in people's minds we're still going to have lawsuits after this that have yet to be settled and so on this is not over today I mean
1103436	1105818	PlayStation Network is still not 100% back up.
1106138	1107839	You can't buy games online right now.
1107859	1110001	And if you're a developer, that kind of sucks.
1110601	1111102	You know what I mean?
1111722	1111962	Yeah.
1112963	1116306	I don't know if you read one of the stories.
1118010	1124491	Well, there's some ridiculous stories regarding this whole thing, but I mean, I don't know.
1124932	1136074	For me, it doesn't really matter because I'm never on PlayStation Network, so it just was an inconvenience because now I had to wait to activate my Steam copy of Portal 2.
1136494	1138675	Well, technically I didn't have to wait, but...
1142348	1144169	It was such a non-event for me.
1144189	1145429	I was like, eh, whatever.
1146150	1146930	So I'm not on it.
1147250	1148030	I can't be on it.
1148230	1148711	Don't care.
1150051	1152072	Oh, actually, this is late breaking.
1152112	1158634	There's another video that was just released by Sony of Kaz Hirai giving an update as to what's going on on PlayStation Network.
1159394	1162415	Let's take a look and see what's going on in this latest announcement from Kaz Hirai.
1163335	1168617	Bueller Bueller Bueller
1170455	1170935	Bueller?
1172897	1173357	Bueller?
1190346	1218146	Publishers and developers obviously have been out quite a bit of money That's three weeks of lost sales and then some Again, the story is not back up just yet Apparently, Sony was not telling the developers and publishers really anything They only had the same information that the rest of us had Sony finally sent out a letter to its publishing partners It was sent out three weeks after the PlayStation Network went down Which is interesting Here's a clip of the letter
1218686	1225774	Dear partner, as you know, certain PlayStation Network curiosity is, which by the way is how you pronounce it, not core-y-ro-city.
1226434	1227676	Curiosity.
1227756	1228977	Q, curiosity.
1229077	1229918	Curiosity.
1230218	1233122	Well, I don't care.
1233542	1234723	Once again, I don't care.
1234863	1239629	Whoa, you're so clever for putting a Q there and making me try to figure out how to pronounce a fucking thing.
1240694	1242775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1267647	1283585	and then they go over exactly what happened which really is all the stuff that you would have got just reading the internet and the various game blogs and what's going on let's see as a valued partner we aim to keep the lines of communication open so that you are aware of our progress
1284346	1291672	Our focus has been to confirm the security of the networks, protect customer data, and get the services back online as quickly as possible.
1292073	1296556	We will do our best to respond to all of your inquiries, and we will do everything we can to possibly support you.
1296977	1300160	I mean, that is a load of crap, if I've ever heard it.
1300680	1302902	We aim to keep the lines of communication open.
1303663	1304503	From now on.
1304563	1308807	Regurgitating what every news outlet has been saying for the past three weeks.
1309147	1309988	That sucks.
1310468	1315013	If I was a PlayStation Network developer, I would be so mad about this.
1315914	1318177	Why weren't you up front with us sooner?
1319058	1323022	And it's really going to give me pause in developing a PlayStation Network exclusive.
1323383	1331612	Sony is really going to have to, as their game plan to get up and going again, they're really going to have to shell out money for exclusive agreements.
1332896	1334777	It's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.
1336719	1340402	Anyhow, some other stuff with the whole PlayStation breach.
1340682	1349708	There's a rumor going around that a rented Amazon server was actually used to launch the attack, which is interesting because Amazon was having all their issues.
1350549	1351670	The web service, not the...
1352370	1355372	Not the same portion of Amazon that sells the books and CDs.
1355412	1360754	But you have to remember, Amazon is a very large service, and they also sell web hosting as part of their service.
1360995	1368599	And you might remember that a bunch of sites they hosted went down, which was a big deal for Amazon because they have service-level agreements that were being broken and so forth.
1369039	1380025	Well, according to Bloomberg News, they are saying that the hackers who actually hacked PlayStation Network rented a server from Amazon.com to do so, signing up for the service using fake information.
1380465	1380645	Hmm.
1381423	1390286	Interesting theory, but pardon my ignorance, but how would this server be used to hack PlayStation Network?
1390626	1394127	I mean, a DDoS is one thing, but that's not what we're talking about happening here.
1394147	1395568	This is not a simple DDoS.
1395928	1399049	Somebody got in there, and the information got exposed.
1399169	1404271	So how does that work using the cloud computer?
1404331	1405872	I mean, I just don't know enough about hacking.
1406392	1407152	Loki, any ideas?
1407172	1407232	Yes.
1408706	1412909	Well, if they're brute forcing something, the more computers they have working on it, the faster it goes.
1414691	1423538	Well, it can be guaranteed that if this is true, you can see a subpoena will be going out to Amazon very soon to try and figure out whose credit card was used to sign up.
1423838	1427921	Which, if that ends up being true, that was kind of dumb of the hackers to do.
1428381	1430823	But they probably used a fake or stolen credit card.
1430843	1431804	Yeah, I'm sure.
1432184	1436808	We'll put fake names, but the credit card, we'll put a real credit card.
1437569	1454307	Or a real credit card name or something like that Also, one other quick thing about this whole thing Retailers are saying that PlayStation 3 owners are just ditching the platform altogether and migrating to the 360
1455168	1456108	You know what would be ironic?
1456128	1457409	Hold on, just real quick.
1457749	1471072	You know one of the stories that came out before they were saying that there was people that were hacking the PlayStation 3 using the... It's a new custom firmware called Rebug or something like that.
1471772	1478214	And basically it gave them access to the developer side of things where you can buy PlayStation content using this...
1479574	1480215	and DarkSakura.
1497212	1502077	Apparently a lot of people were canceling their pre-orders for Brink for the PlayStation 3.
1503399	1507343	Lots of stuff going on in the used market, which I think DarkSakura is going to get into in a minute here.
1507783	1513229	But yeah, lots of PlayStation 3s being traded in, people going to Xbox 360.
1513309	1515792	Again, this is just from a source in Belgium.
1517393	1518274	You know, I'm sure...
1519355	1526837	I'm sure there's an increase over normal, but I'm not sure if it's a, oh shit, PlayStation is damned situation yet.
1527617	1535498	People, I mean, if you're that fickle that you're going to just dump your system because the network's down for a couple weeks, then whatever.
1535518	1536618	That's most people.
1536758	1543960	Then you're going to be fickle enough to buy the system again later on when there's something that you want to play on it, because that's what's going to end up happening.
1544000	1544180	I mean...
1545971	1548374	Live goes down every once in a while for a day and stuff.
1548394	1551498	We don't see people running out in mass selling their consoles.
1551518	1555343	But to be fair, it doesn't go down because somebody stole my credit card information.
1555463	1556645	It's never been down for 22 days.
1556665	1556745	True.
1559830	1561591	You know, there is a big difference to that.
1561912	1570698	But I just think, you know, I do think selling your PlayStation on this alone might be a little bit throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
1571039	1571739	A little bit.
1571839	1577404	I mean, there could be that exclusive that comes out that makes you kind of want to come back, sorta.
1577844	1580606	I mean, if you sell this and you mean it, then...
1581952	1584493	Hey, everybody has that right to make those types of choices.
1584553	1591174	But I know too many people that sell systems only to buy them back when the game they really want comes out.
1591534	1593534	Kind of like the 3DS.
1593694	1598475	If you're selling a 3DS back already, you really should question why you bought one in the first place.
1599015	1601816	I mean, that's really the underlying problem right now.
1601856	1606097	I mean, everybody knows the 3DS lineup right now is weak at best.
1606997	1615307	So, but, there's going to be much better 3DS games by the end of the year between the Kid Icarus, the assumed Mario game that's going to be announced at E3, and so forth.
1615327	1616509	There'll be more reasons to have it.
1616769	1619772	So why sell back a 3DS now just to buy one six months later?
1621285	1626087	But there are people, I mean, and there are going to be a certain percentage of people that just feel so violated by this whole thing.
1626147	1627348	They've sworn off Sony.
1627708	1631190	And this could damage the PlayStation 4 later on.
1631850	1636092	But, I don't know, I think it's a bit too early to really see the full ramifications.
1636452	1641774	I think it is so important more than ever this year to really see what Sony's bringing out the big guns this year at E3.
1642194	1642635	But, you know...
1643935	1650039	I'm not exactly loving the fact that Sony's PlayStation Network was down for 22 days that my credit card information was stolen.
1650799	1655202	But at the same token, I kind of go... And they keep going back and forth on that crap, too.
1655242	1659284	They're like, oh, well, we have no evidence that it actually was stolen.
1659865	1664547	Oh, well, but you still want to be sure and take all these safety precautions.
1664928	1667169	Oh, but we have really no evidence that it's been stolen.
1667729	1669030	They're going back and forth on it.
1669050	1671652	It's just like saying, listen, it's been compromised.
1673112	1673692	and be done with it.
1673732	1678474	Don't say, well, you know, there's really no evidence that they looked at it.
1678494	1679574	You know, they have the data.
1679614	1680394	They stole all of it.
1680414	1680894	Who knows?
1680914	1684815	They maybe just deleted the file and said, pat themselves on the back and said, good job me.
1685055	1686195	I hacked Sony.
1689196	1697918	So, I just, it's going to be interesting because later on this year, you still have some big, you know, The Last Guardian is a game that a lot of people are foaming at the mouth over.
1698278	1699779	So it's very, it's going to be like, you know,
1701565	1703966	Will people forgive us if the games are good enough?
1705207	1707468	It's going to be very, very interesting these next few months.
1708008	1710289	So, anyhow, let's move on.
1710389	1713270	I think DarkSakura has a little more to add to this whole retail angle.
1714119	1730888	Well, actually, there is a notice that, at least in the U.S., that 10 of the most popular online titles that were for PlayStation 3 dropped by an average of 7.4%, basically since the 20th of April.
1731629	1736451	And then the same 10 titles saw a 0.7% increase on Xbox 360 for sales.
1738312	1749856	Also, one of the UK retailers was reporting that they had double the amount of PS3s being brought in and then half of those people picking up an Xbox 360.
1750996	1757678	That also sales of used titles have just completely been borked by PS3.
1758238	1759959	So like two coming in at four?
1759979	1762860	I don't know.
1764440	1766021	It's all fuzzy map it sounds like.
1766940	1770922	Well, at any rate, most people really are that fickle.
1771363	1781068	And it's really people in general, I think, are just so fickle that they're going to not put up with any type of inconvenience.
1781629	1785571	When high real life doesn't always work out for you, you're going to have to wait.
1787001	1787502	I didn't care.
1788003	1791406	Let's go to the chat room at chat.orange.com for some feedback going on right now.
1792067	1799196	GameGuru in our chat room says Red Ring of Death and PlayStation Network being hacked are only comparable in terms of showing the deficiencies that Microsoft and Sony has.
1799936	1800797	Kind of interesting.
1801578	1805323	Yes, because Microsoft was always a software company then they were getting into hardware.
1805783	1810864	But, you know, in Microsoft, though, I think that their response was a little bit better than Sony's.
1811384	1816326	I mean, at least, granted, I don't think they ever really admitted how many are affected.
1816366	1819026	Trust me, it's more than the 1% that they were quoting.
1819346	1820747	It's every single one.
1820847	1821367	Every single one.
1821407	1822487	Every single one launched.
1822547	1822907	Absolutely.
1823067	1827108	Every single one will be affected.
1828008	1834650	If you have one that's from the launch, you know, 2005 or whatever, and it's still working today, that's a fluke.
1835310	1839294	Trust me, I know every single one will die.
1840055	1842477	Salacious Pop responding to something you just said a little bit ago.
1842878	1850806	I think Loki is under-recognizing the huge dude-bro contingent who only play Black Ops, Battlefield, Modern Warfare all day and that's all they play.
1851186	1853088	And they're Sony geeks and never got into Halo.
1853669	1856692	Or, I would add to that, the Blu-ray player was enticing.
1856872	1857092	I mean...
1857933	1866639	Like it or not, the Blu-ray factor being in the PlayStation 3 is still selling a lot of those over Xbox 360s to the dude bro contingent that Salacious Pop brings up.
1866719	1872462	Not the audience that would be listening to this show, but the people that are like, oh, this thing plays Blu-rays and it plays Modern Warfare?
1872522	1872802	Cool.
1873929	1898941	well first of all your blu-ray player will still work and it's back up so what's the problem all of those people now that it took my credit card info so if you gave them your credit card info well on top of that just call the bank and change your shit you know a little inconvenience for your own security sorry you're gonna have to deal with it suck it up
1900117	1900678	I still don't give a shit.
1900698	1901819	Because if somebody tries to use my number, guess what?
1901839	1902980	We'll call and cancel the card.
1903020	1904522	And then they'll trace it back to whoever did it.
1904562	1904922	Don't care.
1923621	1925323	Really don't care.
1926063	1929326	If that happens, you're going to care when it happens if it happens at a bad time.
1929426	1931628	But it's not going to affect my credit.
1931728	1933910	It's not going to affect my finances.
1935271	1938134	The funds will be frozen and I'll get a new card.
1939195	1940976	And hopefully they'll catch whoever did it.
1941517	1942758	Other than that, don't give a shit.
1942987	1944708	Yeah, and I said this a couple weeks before on the show.
1944908	1948611	If somebody were to use this credit card information that's been stolen, you're really an idiot.
1948791	1953514	And you're just asking to get caught for this whole thing.
1953594	1956035	I mean, the FBI is on this now.
1956275	1961038	They're just waiting for someone to fuck this up and give away how this all kind of happened.
1962219	1965420	And also the amount of information they actually got.
1967801	1970562	It's going to take them forever to parse through that stuff anyways.
1971082	1976924	So yeah, there is the risk that your identity might be stolen or something like that.
1977485	1981606	But I think it's very unlikely even still.
1981666	1986988	I think they'll catch them before they even come close to parsing through all the data that's on there.
1988828	1990309	I agree with this comment in our chatroom.
1990329	1995531	DefectiveCandy at chat.ornersoundtrade.com says, If someone tries to use my credit card, guess what?
1995651	1996411	Sucks to be them.
1996611	1997171	I'm broke.
1997511	1997651	Amen.
1997731	2000813	I was just thinking that, you know.
2000933	2004214	I really... I really...
2005743	2010966	Okay, wasting time freaking out over this is really exactly just that, wasting time.
2012306	2014507	All you're doing is working yourself up.
2016448	2021291	Selling your PlayStation 3 is going to mean you're not going to be able to play whatever that is that's going to come out later.
2021871	2025613	And then you're going to have to spend more money to get another one if you want to play it badly enough.
2026253	2030275	So in the end, lacking patience just makes you a loser.
2031256	2031536	That's it.
2032881	2038024	Well, but at the same time, I can understand where somebody is going to sell their PlayStation 3 back over this.
2038145	2038765	I really do.
2039165	2047811	But I just would say think ahead because you don't want to do something reactive only to get sweetened back by Sony later on.
2048231	2060700	We also still don't know what they plan to do to kind of right the wrong and what they're going to give as part of this, I guess you could say, severance package or whatever to kind of come back to the PlayStation 4.
2060740	2061120	Wait, wait, wait.
2061540	2062381	You don't know?
2062921	2063221	And again, I...
2074730	2080492	If I was thinking of selling my PlayStation 3 back, I'd kind of be waiting until after E3 to make sure I really want to do it.
2080832	2091314	I'm not selling my fucking PS3 back because it's a fully backwards compatible PS3 with a 500 gig hard drive in it that I don't play on the PlayStation Network and hardly ever buy games for.
2091454	2094495	So, you know, I'm content with it.
2094695	2095715	I use it for Blu-rays.
2096875	2097115	Great.
2097336	2097716	You know what?
2097896	2101779	If there's a Sony game that really is awesome that I have to have, I can get it.
2101919	2106503	But for everything else that's multi-platform, you better believe it, I'm getting it on the Xbox 360.
2107324	2108505	Because that's just what I play more.
2109306	2110286	It's more convenient for me.
2110947	2112268	PS3's hooked up to the front TV.
2113069	2115571	Nelly wants to play Animal Crossing still.
2118864	2123147	I feel like it's been PlayStation Network all the time for the past three weeks.
2123228	2127050	Believe it or not, there is news in other parts of the gaming world and I think it's time we took a trip there.
2127370	2128251	How about Xbox?
2128291	2129972	Let's talk about something going on in the 360 world, Loki.
2131072	2131873	Thanks for watching!
2148146	2149006	Thanks for watching!
2166975	2173958	So along with that, there's also going to be some other updates including PayPal.
2174378	2177159	It's coming on May 19th, which is interesting.
2177179	2184742	You'll be able to use your PayPal account to add funds for buying Xbox Live Marketplace materials and whatnot.
2185263	2190525	Extremely interesting in light of everything that's going on at Sony that you can kind of use a middleman now.
2191585	2191705	Yeah.
2191765	2191906	Yeah.
2191926	2192006	Yeah.
2192026	2192106	Yeah.
2212208	2224940	you know use the connect to move your avatar around kind of like a talk show almost this sounds kind of weird to me because don't they have a video chat program as it is right now they do but you can't wave around as your avatar
2225805	2226786	And ugly pedophiles.
2226846	2226946	Yeah.
2244834	2248936	And then, of course, as I mentioned, the XGD3.
2249296	2251537	That's the new format that's going to be for the discs.
2252097	2255158	The other thing is, of course, they're going to be adding some more copy protection.
2255438	2259500	It's also going to be flashing all of those people that have flashed modded drives.
2259920	2267563	It's going to be flashing those drives back to their stock firmwares and going to be fixing it in a way where you can't change it.
2268423	2270404	Well, you can't easily change it.
2270504	2271964	We'll get to that a little bit later.
2272604	2272725	But...
2274205	2274426	Neat.
2275087	2283363	You know, that also saves me a step because I have one flash system still that we... It was left over from... I just didn't want to bother to flash it back.
2283563	2284485	And now I don't have to.
2284585	2285567	They're going to do it for me.
2286288	2286609	Awesome.
2288586	2291908	What do you think about this news of what's coming out in the Xbox Spring Update?
2291968	2293870	I mean, usually these updates are pretty exciting.
2293910	2297372	There's at least one little tidbit in there where you're like, oh, that's going to be awesome to have.
2297412	2299533	Like the, I don't know, like the USB storage or whatever.
2299853	2303596	But this time around, I'm looking at the updates going, eh, none of this.
2303856	2305097	I mean, PayPal, okay.
2306057	2307638	I don't know who would use that, but not me.
2308639	2309319	I'd use it.
2309620	2310080	Really?
2311121	2316024	If I was buying a lot of content on Xbox Live, I'd use it because I sell a lot of shit on eBay.
2316744	2322528	Usually, when I'm not dumping my funds back into my bank account, I usually have quite a bit sitting in my PayPal account.
2322548	2323329	I guess I can get that.
2323389	2325310	See, I don't really use PayPal like that.
2325670	2328252	I use PayPal to pay for Skype, and that's about it.
2328772	2335457	We've been using Skype ever since they were a company based in the UK, and it was actually very easy to do the international funds through PayPal.
2337018	2363237	so that's why I have a PayPal account I don't use it for anything else I use it a lot for just buying stuff online I buy a lot of stuff on eBay I buy a lot of stuff like subscriptions for things I'll pay for that that makes sense though for those people that actually use PayPal as a wallet from like eBay and things like that that is kind of a neat way to be able to buy the games I use mine for eBay and Dan uses it for his RC cars alright I get it I guess that is a little bit more exciting but I don't know
2363977	2365358	Let's talk about me again.
2365638	2366619	I am not excited.
2366659	2368340	There's nothing in it for me.
2368400	2374883	See, I don't buy a lot of download content anymore for games other than maybe like a Grand Theft Auto or something like that.
2375083	2379946	I probably wouldn't buy download content for a lot of things.
2380606	2382907	I may or may not have bought Dance Central songs the other day.
2384168	2403939	Well, it's just, you know, I have certain hardware configurations in various places that facilitate the ability to not have to purchase that stuff and yet enjoy the full range of content.
2405825	2408407	I think that's the play's way I can say that.
2409608	2411469	But yeah, I really don't buy a lot.
2411869	2413870	Mainly because look at what I'm playing each week.
2413970	2415672	Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto.
2415852	2419134	There's not any new content coming out for that, so there's nothing for me to buy.
2419154	2422216	DJ Hero, anything they put out, I'll buy.
2422236	2423497	That's just the way it is.
2431468	2437171	All right, let me move on to a story about something that maybe you'll be using your PayPal money to download.
2437211	2437511	I don't know.
2438331	2447155	There has been an ESRB rating that's come out for the Genesis game Monster World 4 coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
2447255	2449316	Now, that kind of spilled the news a little early.
2449816	2467787	Sega of Europe actually confirmed that they are bringing the game over to PlayStation Network and Wii Virtual Console so odd that they left Xbox Live Arcade out of that but whatever maybe something's happening in the future I don't know there's going to be a vintage collection that actually comes out later in
2468007	2474129	You know, they've been milking those Genesis games for all they're worth, and there's still people that'll pay five bucks a game for it, so whatever.
2474669	2482312	This collection's gonna have Wonder Boy and Monster Land, Revenge of Shinobi, Alex Kidd and Miracle World, Wonder Boy and Monster World.
2482612	2486193	Now, all those games have already come out on the virtual console here in North America.
2487493	2495396	But the interesting thing about this, Monster World 4, it was never actually officially released on a console outside of Japan,
2495936	2499521	and get this, it's going to be localized as a part of this collection.
2500022	2506471	So Sega is actually localizing this ages old, what is this, 94, I think, game?
2507793	2508874	Don't say that, Rob.
2509134	2510376	Sorry.
2510396	2511458	That's when I graduated.
2511858	2513320	I don't write the news, I just report it.
2513681	2517425	As trolls would say on the internet, Sega does when Nintendo don't.
2517666	2523814	In other words, localizing an old game that maybe fans might want to play just because they can.
2523834	2525396	That's the best zing I've heard on the show.
2525416	2525876	Don't say that.
2527398	2527778	What's that?
2527958	2528919	Cho Aniki came out.
2529059	2531141	But that's not a Nintendo game.
2531161	2532001	Yeah, it wasn't Nintendo.
2532521	2536064	Yeah, when Sin and Punishment, the original, came out, they didn't bother to translate it.
2536144	2541668	I mean, a lot of those games didn't need translation, but this is really the first time that they've gone back and actually are going to translate a game.
2541928	2548792	Now, I can't imagine Monster World 4 has the epic dialogue of a role-playing game, but it's probably got what?
2548872	2550934	It's kind of a Mario-y style game, right?
2550974	2552995	Sort of a side-scrolling adventure game, right?
2553435	2555437	So it's probably got a decent amount of dialogue.
2555517	2557018	It's kind of neat that they're localizing it.
2558663	2563667	But at the same time, if I have to buy this whole big collection with all these other Genesis games just to get it, I don't know.
2563968	2565008	And I gotta be honest.
2566178	2594507	well I don't know I hear Monster World 4 is really really good and I'm missing a lot by not playing it but my desire to go and pay money for this old 94 game I don't know I'm not like super excited about it I think there's other stuff in the gaming world my money would be spent on but I guess I'll wait and see when this comes out maybe everybody will be like you have to play it it's great and we were missing so much before a good game is still a good game at the end of the day right so alright moving on DarkSakura what do you got for us
2595734	2598221	I have other news related to Disney.
2599945	2604096	I'm first going to point out something that I totally loathe that this article does.
2605385	2610450	Okay, the article says, Disney Studio costs up $3 million for violating kiddie gamers' privacy.
2611191	2612272	But Disney didn't do it.
2612532	2620239	It was titles that had been acquired before Disney acquired Playdom, which is their online kids gaming thing.
2620740	2628947	So to say Disney did it, yeah, Disney may have accepted all the liability, but it wasn't Disney that did it, and I hate when titles are misleading like that, so...
2629688	2651945	But at any rate, Playdom, which is the Disney Social Game Studios, paid $3 million as a settlement for titles that were there before Playdom acquired, I'm sorry, that were acquired by Playdom before Disney acquired it, were collecting kids' ages and email addresses without parental consent.
2652125	2654086	It was posted without parental consent.
2654727	2656228	So Disney coughed up the cash for it.
2656621	2657041	Curse of Acclaim
2684847	2688449	Yeah, and then Playdom bought out Acclaim.
2690450	2695392	But actually the former Acclaim CEO, Howard Marks, is also being named in the case.
2696173	2696633	Oh, snap.
2697073	2705938	So, I would say, you know, whoever holds whatever rights are left, you know, Disney needs to go after them.
2708011	2711993	It's really tricky, especially when you're talking about games marketed towards kids.
2712293	2717517	You know what game comes to mind for me is that Smurfs Village game on iOS has taken a lot of heat.
2717557	2719358	And that's a Capcom game, if I'm not mistaken.
2719718	2725802	The Smurfs Village game, because of how easy it is for kids to get sucked into that game and buy the little Smurf berries.
2726223	2728704	It's just touch, touch, touch to do it.
2728744	2735649	You've heard these stories of kids spending hundreds of dollars on these dumbass Smurf berries to make things grow faster in the game.
2738271	2742115	10 year olds who don't have a true concept of money don't understand that.
2743116	2749863	And parents that don't have a concept of parenting don't understand that their kids are buying stuff through their phone.
2753334	2767130	I think it's funny though because I think back to a time when I was probably like 14 or 15 and I was on Prodigy and Prodigy used to charge for using chat rooms and one month I ran up like a $90 bill in the chat room or something like that and my mother... Oh God, I never heard the end of it, you guys.
2767930	2769112	Never heard the end of it.
2769572	2772916	Yeah, we did the same thing in Prodigy but it wasn't necessarily because of the...
2774992	2780677	The chat room, it was because the number that it picked to dial was long distance.
2780758	2781358	No!
2782379	2782940	Yeah.
2784161	2784721	That's not good.
2784962	2785582	Love dialing.
2786823	2791428	See, I used to have the hookup on AOL back in the day because I dialed in on an 800 number.
2792709	2793850	I thought you had to pay for that.
2794010	2794851	And had a free account.
2795691	2796951	I was going to say, I thought you had to pay for the AOL.
2796971	2798692	I was a chatroom host for Cartoon Network.
2799672	2810035	It was almost impossible not to have a free account through AOL because you'd threaten to cancel or they'd just send you another 72-day trial or whatever.
2810115	2814757	Just a ridiculous amount of... 720-hour trial, that's what it was.
2815917	2817057	Oh, boy, that's 30 days.
2818778	2819158	Awesome.
2820689	2838468	Yeah, but I'm referring to back when it was like $3 an hour or something Back when it had just gotten out of DOS Ranma in the chatroom says Sky, if she didn't beat you with the belt, you got off lucky, lol No, all the abuse in my household was always emotional, never physical
2840871	2842011	That's not abuse.
2842552	2843573	Let's move on.
2844373	2851739	Let's move on and talk about release dates and what's coming out to a store near you, depending on where you live.
2851759	2852540	We'll start with the US.
2853381	2854201	Not much this week.
2854842	2855022	L.A.
2855062	2859146	Noire on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 being the biggest title of the week.
2859766	2860807	It's kind of a big title, right?
2860927	2861868	Yeah, just a little bit.
2862348	2865411	The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings on PC.
2866744	2873669	coming out from Atari, The First Templar on Xbox 360, SpongeBob SquigglePants for the 3DS.
2873709	2880133	This is the game that's sort of like WarioWare, but here it's terrible, so, you know, keep that in mind.
2880413	2882414	Another terrible title for the 3DS.
2883055	2883915	What a shock!
2884236	2885176	Yeah, shocker.
2885536	2888138	Cake Mania Main Street for the Nintendo DS.
2888739	2891100	I'm sure it's all like the other Cake Mania games.
2891841	2893722	Fable 3 on PC this week.
2895123	2895243	Um...
2897421	2920064	And that's it Alright, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there You get your version of Portal 2 this week on the Xbox 360 And the PlayStation 3, those coming out on May the 19th And yeah, those are like localized versions for Japan I don't know if they have all new voice actors or if it uses subtitles or what But yeah, they're getting their own version of Portal 2 So they can get in on the fun that we're having over here
2920784	2936950	again that's on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 also coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week excuse me it's a price reduction not a new game but FIFA Soccer 11 moves into the best hit series from EA it's like it's a big price reduction in Japan this week moving on to the Nintendo Wii nothing this week what a surprise
2937310	2941291	Nintendo 3DS Dead or Alive Dimensions finally gets its release this week in Japan.
2941351	2947214	So I'm sure we'll be hearing some reports on that game and how it turned out because we'll be getting it soon enough.
2947334	2953376	Also on the 3DS over there, Animal Resort, Dobutsu no Tsukuro comes out.
2953656	2957037	And Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars also comes out.
2957377	2962579	Trying to look at this Animal Resort and honestly when I see the box, the first thing I think of, honest, Africa.
2964497	2966058	because it looks just like that game.
2966078	2967579	Who's putting out Animal Resort?
2968260	2971562	Animal Resort is being put out by... Who is this?
2971662	2973244	AQ Interactive is putting out the game.
2973264	2973644	But look at this.
2974605	2977767	There's elephants you can take pictures of and hippopotamus.
2977807	2984572	It looks like you feed them because there's little items there on the bottom and it looks like this guy is dragging a type of fruit to feed the hippopotamus.
2984872	2985753	But this is adorable.
2985813	2987834	There's apparently penguins in this.
2987874	2989376	So now I kind of want it, to be honest.
2989496	2990416	It looks pretty good.
2990476	2993699	I mean, for a 3DS title, the graphics are pretty good.
2994620	2997062	It's kind of an interesting twist on Nintendogs.
2997202	3000485	I bet what this is is it's kind of like Nintenzu.
3001046	3003067	Maybe it's like Anemon Snap.
3003328	3013357	Well, I was just wondering if the only reason I asked who made it is because there's a title coming from Ubisoft called Zoo Mania that looks similar to that.
3013477	3015639	I'm wondering if it's actually the exact same game.
3016338	3016738	Perhaps.
3016838	3017539	I'll have to look that up.
3018159	3022262	On the Sony PSP this week on May the 19th, Akiba's Strip comes out.
3022842	3026644	This is... That's what it sounds like.
3027525	3029746	It's a game where you get people to strip.
3030046	3031187	No, you don't get people to strip.
3031207	3031727	Yes, you do.
3032508	3032748	What?
3033028	3033268	Yes.
3034049	3035790	By fighting them, their clothes will be removed.
3038491	3041494	Oh my god, that is what's really happening in this picture.
3041594	3044176	It looks like she's wearing cat ears and no pants.
3044416	3044537	Well...
3059912	3062474	They do not have fully nude games on the PSP.
3062634	3063694	Trust me, I've looked.
3064635	3066716	The wife really wants one.
3066976	3068517	Well, no, they sell them on J-List.
3069858	3072880	They're X-rated UMDs, that's what those are.
3073200	3075702	But they don't have actual PSP games.
3076822	3079064	I mean, come on, this is Japan we're talking about.
3079604	3082986	They're very conservative when it comes to video games.
3084207	3084627	Uh-huh.
3085233	3085893	Dead or Alive Dimensions, and L.A.
3085913	3086013	Noire
3115160	3115620	And that's it.
3140234	3143436	and Kinect, Windows Phone and an array of other Windows devices.
3143936	3150640	And also, of course, they announced that they'll still be supporting the platforms that it's on already.
3150761	3154123	The PSP and whatnot.
3154823	3164869	And I guess it says also Skype users with Link, Outlook and Xbox Live and other communities will be able to connect with Skype as well.
3164929	3166930	So that's kind of neat.
3166950	3166990	Um...
3168491	3176321	I'm wondering now if we're going to see Windows with Skype built in as a default program and stuff like that.
3176341	3179886	I just think it's kind of neat that they're going to have...
3181703	3183786	I wonder if they're going to do the Avatar Connect with Skype.
3184847	3185067	Maybe.
3185348	3187910	Certainly this is going to be coming to the 360 sooner rather than later.
3187950	3193056	I'm kind of surprised this isn't being rushed for the spring update because that's a pretty big addition.
3193176	3201125	I understand that I guess right now the Connect to video chat will work with Windows Messenger, but I don't know anyone that uses Windows Messenger.
3201145	3201666	Yeah.
3202987	3230292	That's not also on an Xbox So I don't know But you know the interesting thing about this We've been using Skype here at Orange Lounge Radio Since before podcasting I think we took our first Skype call Probably in 03 However old Skype is We were on that really early We're pretty loyal to the program Until it steals our credit card information Or something We're not going to go anywhere Until it out parties Kaz Exactly
3232094	3238180	It's going to be very interesting because pretty soon we're going to be able to invite phone calls from people on their connects to chat with the show.
3238260	3239681	That's going to be something.
3239982	3244466	That is pretty something, except the only problem is you still can't stream the show onto the 360.
3247006	3247486	Not yet.
3247526	3249127	I wish there was something they would do about that.
3249147	3254451	Not unless you have... No, you can't do it through Pandora.
3254471	3258233	Is it Last.fm that's on there or Pandora?
3258433	3258993	I can't remember.
3259093	3259834	Last.fm's on there.
3260254	3260895	Last.fm.
3261015	3262155	I don't think you can get it through there.
3263876	3266718	I mean, you could hook it up to a PC, but what's the point?
3267919	3271301	If it's hooked up to a PC already, then you might as well just use the PC.
3271798	3279412	Misty, who is one of our archive experts in our chatroom, says she knows we were taking them at least by episode 111, which would have been 04.
3280734	3282377	I'm pretty sure we were taking them before that.
3284318	3285779	Yeah, so it was a while ago.
3286620	3291965	Anyhow, be very curious to see what this kind of all pans out to.
3292365	3294327	A lot of people are saying they paid too much for Skype.
3294387	3294888	What do you think?
3296129	3298251	I don't know how much Skype is worth.
3299332	3300393	It's worth nothing to me.
3300933	3301834	I'm not paying for it.
3302495	3331417	uh yeah I mean Skype doesn't really do ads and they're free you know it's it's they're gonna have to add ads to it at some point I think and I don't know how people are gonna feel about that well they have to have some I mean they're they have you know the Skype out services and stuff like that that's kinda neat you know um and you know if they're pushing the whole family angle and stuff hey now you can call your friends on their phones and stuff like that or I don't know
3332455	3343482	All right, well, the Level Up event was held by Namco Bandai this week, and we want to go over some news from that event, including, and this makes me very excited, a new Soul Calibur game was announced, and I love the Soul Calibur series.
3343822	3346084	So yeah, Soul Calibur V was announced this week.
3346644	3347305	That's pretty cool.
3347325	3348125	That's going to be happening.
3349666	3351828	There was a little teaser trailer that was released.
3351848	3354690	Let me see if I can play a little bit of it here in Z Studio.
3356051	3359473	Not a whole lot of characters showed up in there, but I think Nightmare's in there.
3360574	3366959	Apparently there's a new character named Patroclus, who's supposed to be the son of Sophitia and Rothian.
3367439	3368380	So, could be interesting.
3368660	3372183	The game is going to be out in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
3372543	3376286	It is set 17 years after the events of Soul Calibur 4.
3377246	3380309	So yeah, I guess there's going to be quite a bit of roster revision going on there.
3380809	3384692	Siegfried is also supposed to be in the game, so could be interesting.
3384892	3386413	Our kind should not exist in this world Not ever again
3408846	3412528	So this trailer is more like the opening cutscene that you would see in the game, probably.
3412568	3413969	It doesn't really show a lot of gameplay.
3414029	3415791	It's your very typical announcement trailer.
3416291	3418152	But I'm looking forward to it.
3418172	3418773	It's going to be awesome.
3418793	3421034	I hope you still get to make your own character and all that stuff.
3421654	3423776	I actually didn't play any of the make your own character ones.
3424266	3427669	Very interesting tweet that actually came out in response to this.
3427770	3431413	The game director, Daishi Odashima, actually tweeted this.
3432014	3436418	I asked the company if we can call the game Soul Edge 2, but they said no.
3437539	3444666	So that might give you an idea about where this is going also, because remember, the first Soul Calibur game, if you will, was really Soul Edge.
3445067	3445287	Hmm.
3446488	3450811	Also news coming out of the event, Tekken X Street Fighter hasn't even started yet.
3451131	3452793	Keep in mind there's two games being made.
3452813	3455555	There's Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.
3455895	3460158	Apparently Namco Bandai has said they haven't even really started work on Tekken X Street Fighter yet.
3460258	3462099	So yeah, interesting.
3462620	3468284	The quote from producer Katushiro Harada said, quote, we really haven't started on Tekken X Street Fighter.
3468624	3490964	things are going well with Street Fighter X Tekken and we'll have more on that at E3 we hope you look forward to that so I don't know maybe they're spacing the games out a little bit kind of interesting by the way speaking of Street Fighter X Tekken a new teaser came out for it this week and it shows Cammy so Cammy will be in the game which really doesn't surprise anyone I'm sure some other little bits and pieces that came out of that as well
3491408	3496093	Ace Combat Assault Horizons coming out October 11th in the US and the 14th in Europe.
3496733	3501318	There's a new CG feature film based on Tekken called Tekken Blood Vengeance.
3501899	3506703	Tales of Graces and Tales of Abyss also coming out on the PS3 and the 3DS respectively.
3507344	3515232	And wait for it, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact coming out on the PSP because your life just wasn't complete without another Naruto game.
3516255	3516595	DarkSakura.
3537338	3537618	No.
3537799	3541723	And funny enough, totally ironically, I had no idea DarkSakura was going to pick this game.
3542164	3543565	I was playing this last night.
3544526	3544967	Crazy.
3545327	3546769	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3546989	3547750	Oom Jamalami.
3549252	3550854	Oom Jamalami.
3551695	3551995	Okay.
3552195	3554077	And I put in the one I thought was your favorite.
3554278	3556020	This is my favorite song in the soundtrack.
3562004	3568145	Anyway, Umjermalami, yeah, and I did cover Parappa series, but I'm doing Umjermalami anyway, I don't care.
3569365	3575507	Umjermalami was put out by Nana Onsha and Namco in the arcade.
3575547	3576947	Sorry, the music died behind you.
3577027	3578908	It's just YouTube's failing us tonight.
3578968	3579288	Sorry, guys.
3579308	3580168	It's being uber fail.
3581508	3604881	at any rate, it came out in Japan on March 18th, 1999 and in North America on August 17th, 1999 and yeah, it plays like Parappa, pretty much Namco released the arcade version and it had a guitar controller so that you could get the sensation of playing a guitar I mean, it's very similar to Guitar Freaks we've seen one of these machines, remember?
3605681	3606201	I do!
3606341	3607402	I do remember the machine.
3607422	3609363	I had to get on my knees to play it.
3610323	3610584	Don't.
3610824	3612164	Get your minds out of the gutter, people.
3613405	3615326	It was made for kids, and I'm a little tall.
3616118	3618339	Anyway, it's like a Simon Says sort of thing.
3618459	3623481	So, you know, their characters will do something, and then you do something.
3623841	3626403	And you have to basically repeat whatever it tells you to do.
3627483	3631925	And so through the game, you have a Chop Chop Master Onion from Parappa.
3633025	3635406	And that's where you get Dojo Casino.
3635467	3636387	It's all in the mind.
3636427	3638928	And she goes, yeah, my guitar is in my mind!
3639928	3640349	And then...
3642907	3649029	But the whole thing is basically Lammy trying to get to her concert with her group Milk Can at the Chop Shop Master Arena.
3649949	3654171	And so she has to put out a fire and babysit babies with Kathy Pillar, which is this song.
3654511	3655911	And then fly an airplane.
3656492	3659013	And then chop down a tree to make a new guitar.
3659613	3670877	And then she actually, well, gets sent to an island, but in the Japanese version she actually dies and goes to hell.
3672217	3676380	and I found a movie file of that to play for everybody.
3678701	3679802	Oh, that's my cue, isn't it?
3679862	3680202	Sorry, hold on.
3680222	3680963	Yes, it is, Rob.
3681363	3682243	Here we go.
3682303	3684545	And this is where Rob stops texting on his iPhone.
3685265	3686366	Hold on, let me bring this up.
3688107	3688727	Distortion.
3688767	3689028	Thank you.
3707331	3709232	Two more minutes and I'm history.
3712394	3713615	She's running in front of traffic.
3713775	3715116	These interludes were so bad.
3715696	3719678	Slips on the banana peel that PJ Berry is eating the bananas.
3720739	3721499	Cracks her head.
3723240	3724121	And dies.
3725482	3726522	Stupid PJ Berry.
3728743	3729504	Stupid fat bear.
3733470	3742614	No bitch or 2D.
3742734	3749936	That's what I think every time I show up to this show, too.
3749976	3750577	And then the credits roll.
3750597	3751077	This is great.
3764535	3766515	Oh, there's the guitarist!
3766555	3767916	Come on, hurry, hurry!
3767976	3769877	We need you out there!
3770337	3771718	Not yet, not yet!
3773418	3777580	And then she goes on stage with Teriyaki Yoko.
3777600	3783063	Yeah, and that whole thing was cut out of the US version.
3783623	3786404	Yeah, they had her showing up on a desert island.
3788172	3791735	and so it went into the whole Vital Idol song.
3792916	3799961	And where she gets faxed back to life instead of teleported via fax from the island.
3801422	3802723	So yeah.
3803824	3806586	Now I will tell you something, because I'll tell you why I would pick this.
3806626	3808007	Dan and I discussed this today.
3808927	3813110	And I was saying how I had a demo disc of this and it had...
3814071	3816713	All of the stuff in the game just locked out.
3817313	3824599	And it had the original, you know... Because in Chop Chop Master Onion's song it said, you could play in hell and go far.
3825219	3830363	And it's on the demo disc, not on... Anyway, but all this was left in Europe and Japan.
3830503	3831503	But in the U.S.
3831544	3834025	people had to get a stick up their butt and have her go to an island.
3834706	3837708	So anyway, you have four different ranks.
3837768	3838228	You have...
3839689	3845413	Good, you have bad, and you have awful, and if you get below awful, then your song ends.
3846113	3849336	And the quality of music changes also with each one too.
3849736	3854479	But now you can also get cool, and so you basically can freestyle unless you really screw up.
3854899	3859342	But if you keep cool by the end of the song, you'll get a cool ending to the level.
3860102	3863365	But if it flashes good, then you go back into normal play.
3864736	3875505	Like, for this one, you know, if you get cool, then Teriyaki Yoko goes, okay, you can go by yourself, and then you're in this tunnel, but if you drop back down to Goji, he goes, okay, well, you need me after all.
3876041	3880562	But you also get different morphers to your sound.
3880582	3886263	You get a flanger, you get a harmonizer, you get the wah-wah, you get distortion and a reverb.
3886664	3889824	And they're actually from different items you get.
3889904	3900127	Like, in order, it's a fire siren, a caterpillar rattle, Captain Fuss and Pepper's false teeth, who was the headbanging pilot in, I think, Stage 4.
3901527	3902788	Oh god, I love that stage.
3902808	3903548	Can I play that music?
3903648	3903948	Sure.
3904429	3905569	That music was awesome.
3905910	3908171	You know, I could never beat that unless I did it cool.
3908891	3909171	Really?
3909271	3910012	That level, uh-huh.
3910112	3911272	But I could always get it to go cool.
3912713	3913614	Let me play a little bit.
3919449	3919930	Horns on!
3919950	3921191	That's a trap level.
3921251	3927296	This person's going for cool, too, so... Anyhow.
3927436	3927616	Yeah.
3927656	3927996	Anyway, um...
3943864	3955687	And so you also got a fever time so that when you enter a level after it's been completed, it brings up a chocolate screen with symbols.
3956187	3964029	And if you input everything in the right order, when the level is cool, the screen goes really crazy and symbols fly all over the place.
3964749	3969270	And then you can hit those buttons repeatedly and get uber points.
3970069	3988954	So yeah, the arcade version was called Um Jammer Lamy Now, and it had a guitar controller, and it had the buttons for triangle, circle, X, and square are strummers in the middle of the guitar, and the L button is a slider at the top of the guitar, and there's a scratch disc at the bottom instead of the R button.
3989734	3998576	But it's really the same as the home version, and there is an ability to play with Parappa in that too.
3999170	4006919	So you've got Lamy mode, and then you have your co-op, which is Lamy and Ramy, who is the dark version of Lamy.
4007280	4009763	Then you have Versus, which is Lamy versus Ramy.
4010363	4015429	You have Solo Parappa, you have Lamy and Parappa, and then you have Versus, Lamy, and Parappa.
4015950	4017452	And then you have a special mode.
4018192	4019013	So, um...
4020869	4026372	It's basically, you can just listen to any of the songs in good, bad, awful, or cool mode.
4027472	4034036	And, of course, you could also do that if you had the PSX Play little program and could rip all your files, but I digress.
4034756	4040059	So, you also had, like I said, there were the changes.
4040259	4042020	Now, I brought up the hell changes.
4043100	4043200	Um...
4044421	4051327	But for Paul Chuck in Stage 5, instead of chopping trees down for the fun, it was changed knowing that we're here for the fun.
4051527	4053949	And then, of course, Teriyaki Yoko, like I said.
4054990	4067019	And... Lammy is actually wearing a camouflage t-shirt and has jungle makeup to show that she's in the jungle.
4067259	4067580	Ooh...
4069028	4097398	and then also the scene before stage 7 has Catty Cat and Masan riding a camel and the ending credits is an instrumental version of Keep Your Head Up and then Chop Chop Master Onion's music was of course changed the demo like I said has everything in it and then there was three soundtracks came out one called Make It Sweet which is all the music done by Milk Can and
4097938	4110444	and there was called Ice Cream which was remixed versions of the songs and that was with Dread Fox as Parappa and then the whole original soundtrack which I've got somewhere.
4111044	4115046	So yeah, the game is super awesome, it's super fun and it's...
4116787	4120510	Really great, but I still think it's stupid that they had to change it.
4120711	4126235	In fact, GameVortex criticized it, and I think this is the best way of saying something.
4126255	4129758	They said it was an unfortunate thing, and said, Did I miss some logical leap?
4129878	4132421	I think our kids can handle such a basic concept as hell.
4133602	4133862	The end.
4134867	4137409	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Um Jamalami.
4138070	4142613	You know, and I was none the wiser when I first played this game, because, you know, I wasn't really following the import gaming scene, you know.
4143234	4152901	See, I had bought a certain game, actually, it was at Anime Expo, and I talked my way into a demo disc, because I was so excited about this game.
4153101	4153362	Nice.
4155007	4155327	All right.
4155668	4157229	Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4157889	4161592	Anyhow, we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere, guys.
4161892	4165674	We've got plenty more to come in Part B tonight, including some other new game announcements.
4166435	4170297	In Rapid Fire News tonight, a big arcade collection has been announced.
4170437	4174980	Also, a big popular beta has been announced for later this year.
4175020	4175601	It's going to be huge.
4176201	4183926	Also, we're going to get into some more lawsuits in Part B, some Portal 2 news, and, yeah, some more localization, or maybe not.
4185427	4194913	Unlocalized games that you can still buy locally That'll make sense in a little bit Anyhow, we're going to take a break But stay tuned guys, we'll be back with more Of Orange Lounge Radio
4201124	4201704	Thanks for watching!
4218135	4225899	and some discussions there in part A about PlayStation Network, of course, coming back online, although I don't know, it's still a little spotty for some people.
4226259	4231162	Monster World 4 getting a localization finally, and of course the big story this week about Microsoft buying Skype.
4232582	4235584	I noticed in studio here that Loki is playing Portal 2.
4235624	4237305	It looks very nice on your laptop, I gotta say.
4237325	4239166	The graphics for that are pretty smooth.
4239586	4242247	You must have a pretty powerful little laptop there, I didn't realize.
4242327	4242828	Yes, I do.
4243128	4243388	Nice.
4243728	4244788	So, are you enjoying the game so far?
4245009	4245209	Yeah.
4245389	4247390	It looks like you're pretty far into it, from what I can tell.
4247950	4248150	DarkSakura
4269597	4275879	I do Comic Insanity with Tiara, also known as Mar and Marvel, and Dan Shadow.
4276660	4286003	And we have a new one coming up on Tuesday with our new format, where we introduce a few new segments and condense a couple other segments.
4286023	4286804	So it's new stuff.
4286844	4289845	But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.
4290525	4295847	And you can also find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, with no I.
4296440	4296780	All right.
4297220	4304084	Well, my podcast that I do with my buddy, Extifer, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, about all things World of Warcraft.
4304364	4309186	We're not having a format switch this week, but I believe we're having DarkSakura on as our guest this week, so that'll be exciting.
4309446	4309846	Hopefully.
4310067	4310247	Yep.
4310507	4323193	So, yeah, you can check that out, www.hordehouse.com for more information about our little program there where we talk about the World of Warcraft, but never too seriously, because I'll tell you what, I've been kind of a jaded Warcraft player lately.
4323693	4326436	So I have not been the most happy-go-lucky about the game.
4326837	4329239	And I know everybody's like, well then quit, asshole!
4329700	4335786	But I've got too many friends that play, and how would I slay internet dragons without my WoW?
4336387	4339150	Anyhow, more talk about World of Warcraft on that show.
4339190	4340091	I do not fap to Warcraft.
4342839	4349706	Although apparently, I don't want to give too much away, but apparently Extifer has been playing on a server notorious for the FAP chat.
4350387	4353170	And he's going to give us a report on that this week, so that should be exciting.
4353911	4356393	As a role player, you're going to really look forward to that, huh, DarkSakura?
4357855	4358816	Oh, baby.
4360276	4363597	Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.
4363617	4368218	There was a lot of little stories this week that unfortunately the PlayStation Network was kind of dominating over.
4368958	4369618	But let's get to it.
4369838	4370758	Loki, some quick stuff.
4371378	4373179	Oh, by the way, your Twitter topic is coming up after this.
4373499	4375959	If you haven't gotten your tweets in, you've got like two minutes to do it.
4375999	4377200	Twitter.com slash OLR.
4377580	4382121	Including one item that actually will be played on the PlayStation Network, Starhawk.
4382601	4387362	It is the new, I guess, more futuristic sequel to Warhawk.
4388402	4390883	That'll be coming soon, hopefully.
4391383	4393364	I'm sure it's going to be something they show off at E3.
4393944	4395925	And I've been teased for a while.
4395965	4398606	I even think there's some assets or something that leaked out about it.
4399587	4401928	But apparently... Oh, next year is when it's due out.
4402408	4404809	It'll be the same kind of format as Warhawk was.
4405229	4407970	They even promised space battles at some point.
4408710	4410351	Not sure how that's going to really work, but...
4411612	4416756	Also, a single-player story mode and a build-in battle system will be coming to it as well.
4417317	4421400	So, if you like that game, you may want to check it out.
4421800	4427445	I know that the original game is really cheap right now, so if you want to check that out, it might be worth it.
4428586	4429347	And then, of course...
4431348	4437953	Uh, yes, the developers of Splosion Man comes, uh, Splosion, uh, Ms.
4438013	4454544	Splosion Man, and, of course, not to, um, you know, pass up capitalizing on what might be an internet sensation, um, you know, 2G1C, you know, might, some people may think Two Girls, One Cup, but no, Two Girls, One Controller.
4455064	4458887	So, in this game mode... I try not to think about Two Girls, One Cup ever.
4459527	4459867	Yeah.
4460008	4460528	Thanks, Loki.
4461148	4468172	uh two girls one controller it's a different mode that's going to be in the game you're actually going to control each uh one of the Ms.
4468232	4481179	Splosion men um with one analog stick on the controller and you would detonate them with the you know trigger buttons I believe so um it's interesting um
4482833	4486617	I don't know how that'll play, but it's something that they're throwing in that you can try out.
4487658	4494505	And then finally, as I was mentioning earlier, of course, a new update coming out for the Xbox 360.
4494765	4500671	It's gonna reflash those people that had modified firmwares on their DVD drives.
4501852	4508616	Well, to combat that, of course, people out there have tools to get around things.
4508977	4516301	And one hacker or toolmaker, I guess, Electron, has released eTool version 0.2.
4517122	4524787	It is a new tool for extracting and injecting the key from the light-on fat drives that were flashed with the new firmware by the beta dash.
4525627	4534951	So because those firmwares, once they get flashed, it's unable to be read by popular programs like the Jungle Flasher and stuff like that.
4535431	4540193	So now this program will actually read the keys from that and it will also read flashed drives for you.
4540313	4547775	So I have a feeling that this new format that they're going to be putting out there will get bypassed very quickly.
4548015	4551317	In fact, I have a feeling it will be bypassed within a month.
4552597	4554498	That's probably being very generous.
4559113	4561014	and then, yeah, that's it.
4561835	4562235	Alright.
4562795	4566398	Do you think that hack poses a pretty serious threat to all the research?
4566418	4567518	Well, it's one of the many.
4567558	4578866	I mean, Commodore Forever, they're working on a new firmware for their all drives, actually, and I believe that already is almost done.
4578906	4582128	They're just doing some further testing with the new XGD3 format.
4582348	4582468	So, um...
4587591	4589472	I'm assuming, though, that that's probably bypassing it.
4589952	4594673	Then there's also the X360 key, which is supposed to be coming out at some point.
4594893	4610196	That's going to emulate the drive altogether, and that, I think, is the worst threat they could possibly have because right there, that's playing game ISOs off of a hard drive without needing to really modify your system.
4610256	4611096	It's plug-and-play.
4611136	4614437	You plug it in between your drive and the system.
4615637	4615917	All right.
4616337	4617138	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
4641681	4642302	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
4661843	4664004	It did finally go official, but it wasn't supposed to.
4664024	4667865	I think this was leaked early from the Korean side of Blizzard Entertainment.
4668145	4670786	There's a new follower system in Diablo 3.
4671086	4674487	You actually hire characters to help you out in the game.
4674787	4682130	This kind of sounds inspired by Torchlight, actually, because you can kind of have the pet and one of the classes, you can get all these little demon followers.
4682190	4682570	Pretty cool.
4682930	4685353	But these followers will actually be in different classes.
4685513	4688155	Enchantress, Scoundrel, Templars.
4688175	4693581	You're going to be able to give these guys weapons, rings, and you'll even be able to give them their own skills.
4693601	4697385	Yeah, this really sounds like the pets from Torchlight, but maybe a little more fleshed out.
4697465	4698266	So that's pretty exciting.
4699447	4702069	Dark Souls, this game is going to be hard as hell.
4702129	4704051	It's going to come out October 11th.
4704071	4712559	Of course, this is the unofficial, well, I shouldn't say unofficial, but the don't call it a sequel, but it is to Demon's Souls, which was one of those hard as hell games on the PlayStation 3.
4713280	4716503	One of the best hands down PlayStation 3 exclusive games.
4717404	4719706	Dark Souls is going to be coming out on October 11th.
4721368	4725130	Even though there's been the PlayStation Network outages and so forth, that's not going to stop them.
4726211	4738758	Kai Hirono, who's the producer of the game, spoke with CVG saying that the outage caused, quote, some problems for the development, but that the team is, quote, in contact with Sony and is aiming to meet a street date of October 11th.
4738798	4740620	Well, it's nice that Sony's talking to some of their people.
4741600	4767917	And also, finally from me tonight, oh god, it's taken only 413 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio But finally, I get to report on a story about Lady Gaga And yes, it reports, I'm sorry, it relates to gaming That's right, Lady Gaga is coming to, I can't believe I'm going to say this either, Farmville Oh, I saw the ads for that
4768669	4774957	Yeah, Lady Gaga and Zynga a while ago had this whole donation for Japanese disaster relief going on.
4775318	4781706	And I guess that partnership has grown into the May 17th opening of GagaVille.
4782588	4783349	It is going to be a...
4783789	4785231	Thank you for watching!
4805393	4806293	Kind of interesting.
4806393	4810015	At first, I kind of looked at this and I was like, oh, God, really?
4810055	4811116	This is so gross.
4811196	4814337	Like, I'm going to have to go and play Farmville again if I want to hear new Gaga songs.
4814677	4816198	Like, fuck you, Lady Gaga.
4816258	4817038	I don't want to do this.
4817438	4818579	But then I kind of thought about it.
4818599	4825662	I'm like, actually, considering that, like, you know, Gaga's fan base is a lot of like, you know, let's face it, like.
4826423	4826783	Losers?
4827544	4834270	Fuck you Middle-aged to teenage girls And who's playing mostly Farmville?
4834590	4849163	Middle-aged to teenage girls So whereas I'm not super excited about this They're targeting the right audience So it is really smart marketing Of course, just as a person who's not a big fan of Zynga products I'm not that excited, but I get it
4849952	4853654	She was on American Idol the other day, and I don't get it.
4854234	4862097	I really don't understand the appeal of her, and I have no appeal of her as a person, her as an artist, her music.
4862497	4864038	It's seriously lost on me.
4864961	4866502	I think her music's very catchy.
4866522	4867283	That's what it's all about.
4867323	4871426	And I think she's a very genuine person from her interviews and so forth.
4871526	4872167	She's genuine.
4872587	4873688	Yeah, I understand.
4874469	4876090	How strange can it be?
4876110	4881034	There's a lot of marketing machine behind it, yes, but she's a living, breathing piece of art.
4881214	4881955	That's how I see her.
4884377	4885418	But that's okay if you don't get it.
4885938	4887860	Art is meant to be interpreted in many different ways.
4888360	4889581	Yeah, okay.
4890942	4891503	I'm sorry.
4892143	4894285	Being as strange as possible is not art.
4897851	4899612	How fucking crazy can I be?
4900313	4902615	Well, hey, I'm not fucking calling what I do art.
4904377	4906779	Seriously, if anyone calls it... I just keep thinking of Eddie Izzard now.
4907359	4910502	I'm going to put poop on my head and sell myself to an art gallery.
4913465	4918267	Yes, I'm waiting for the full fecal suit from Lady Gaga.
4919007	4920008	It's on its way.
4920388	4922109	That's the path she is traveling.
4922129	4925930	Maybe when she's in the retirement home 50 years from now, she'll be wearing a poop suit.
4926531	4930612	Please, it's just going to be... I don't know.
4930672	4931313	She'll have...
4933191	4938173	She'll make some sort of suit out of some sort of dinosaur fossil.
4938754	4943376	Come out there, you know, calling like an eagle or something like that.
4943476	4945537	Take a giant dump on stage.
4945957	4948558	Roll around in it and set herself on fire.
4949118	4949599	Boom!
4949919	4951940	Lady Gaga concert next year, okay?
4952800	4981108	alright look I can't believe I'm about to say this but this is too much Lady Gaga chat for our show so let's move on with some more gaming news do you never saw the link I sent the two links I sent you what's that well you know I keep up with the gal fashion and one of the companies that I like their clothes is actually Lady Gaga's working with one of the men's styles to release a bunch of t-shirts I get all my news from the fuck yeah Lady Gaga Tumblr anyhow and I sent you paper dolls
4981758	4982398	Let's move on.
4982418	4983079	More gaming news.
4984219	4986300	Okay, well, how about Angry Birds?
4986621	4989742	It's on Chrome OS and the Chrome browser.
4990303	4994885	You can actually play it now, apparently.
4996226	5007192	It's free to play, has microtransactions, but the web-exclusive ones have Chrome bombs and exclusive Chrome levels and the pay-per-use Mighty Eagle.
5008312	5009213	Yeah, don't care.
5010574	5011054	What, Rob?
5011482	5014103	Sorry, I'm just reading our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com.
5014403	5017243	TigerClaw says, doing OLR should be considered an art form.
5018543	5022644	And SalaciousPop says, OMG, Lady Gaga channeling Gigi Allen.
5022984	5031166	He did all those, or maybe Alin, I don't know this artist, but he did all of those things that Loki just said, by the way, including the fire and the poop.
5032326	5034587	So it's already been done, Loki, so Gaga can't do it.
5034627	5035067	I'm sorry.
5035427	5036427	How about gaming?
5036807	5037047	Yes.
5037188	5038068	Minecraft stuff.
5039108	5051892	Basically, the creator, Marcus Pearson, has a poll on his blog about MinecraftCon, seeing if people would be interested in attending it in Las Vegas.
5051912	5053072	So there is a...
5055040	5056881	A no and a yes.
5057061	5058522	And so far, no is winning.
5059482	5065325	So... I will be bringing a bunch of blocks to put in front of the door to trap everyone in MinecraftCon.
5066345	5074009	I'm looking at the screen capture from, I'm guessing, from Minecraft and it looks completely... These people have too much damn time.
5075495	5076815	So how about Mortal Kombat?
5077216	5077776	Yeah, I don't know.
5078216	5084218	I think Minecraft con's not a terrible idea because, hell, they have cons for people that dress up like furry animals.
5084318	5095901	So, you know, if the furries can have their con... Mortal Kombat Collection will be... The original trilogy will be going on the Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.
5096181	5102383	And, of course, collection is spelled with a K. And it will also be on PC for 800 Microsoft points.
5102724	5104104	Does Lady Gaga have a convention?
5105885	5107546	Would it be called Gaga for GagaCon?
5107846	5108247	Perhaps.
5108587	5109808	I know Cher has a convention.
5109828	5111009	Did I ever tell you about that story?
5111029	5111349	No.
5111549	5112630	I was in LA.
5112670	5115612	I was in Woodland Hills specifically for work doing some stuff down there.
5116133	5122898	And I was staying at a hotel and I get in this elevator with literally 15 people all decked out in Cher shirts and concert.
5122918	5124599	And I was kind of like, oh, is Cher in town?
5124619	5126821	They're like, no, there's a Cher convention going on here at the hotel.
5127261	5129523	And I'm like, oh, is she here?
5129883	5131084	And they're like, no, she's in France.
5131784	5132145	Like, oh.
5133286	5135167	But she sent a video or something like that.
5135427	5164373	if I can turn back time I literally walked into a Cher convention and despite what you may think about homosexuals I'm not like screaming ah for Cher like she's cool I think she's pretty fierce I want to watch the show about Chaz oh I don't yeah I don't really follow the Cher stuff but my mother loves Cher I got dragged to a Cher concert by my mother Rob I just love Cher she's so funny she's such a diva Rob I like your mom
5166226	5167347	I want your mom to adopt me.
5167467	5169209	I can't believe she's younger than me though.
5170010	5171271	Alright, anyhow.
5172112	5173333	Oh yeah, Mortal Kombat Collection.
5173393	5173954	Sounds great.
5174314	5179539	If we didn't already have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox Live Arcade and Mortal Kombat 2 on PlayStation Network.
5180860	5183122	But didn't they stop selling 3 or something?
5183142	5183603	They did.
5183863	5186245	Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was delisted some time ago.
5186326	5190029	Yeah, it was delisted after they decided hey, we're going to re-release it again.
5190129	5190710	Ha ha!
5192649	5192929	Alright.
5194130	5196992	Anyhow, Ranma in our chatroom says, Gaga convention?
5197032	5198553	It's called the West Village, Rob.
5198994	5199494	So noted.
5200635	5208420	I would like to pick up that whole Mortal Kombat with the new arcade stick they're going to put out, though, because Mortal Kombat 2 especially was so awesome.
5208440	5214324	Well, they were, whatever happened to, they were supposed to be putting out an HD collection or something like that on the PlayStation 3.
5214364	5215906	It's going to be all the Mortal Kombat games.
5215966	5217247	I think that's this.
5218067	5234442	but this isn't this or this isn't that it's basically just hey look we're porting the shit straight over we're not doing anything to it hey you know what it's too much work to actually do something let's just release the old shit
5236022	5237323	Alright, let's go to some Twitter.
5237343	5238343	Let's do it the Nintendo way.
5238943	5240064	Let's go to the tweets.
5240924	5242825	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5242925	5243625	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
5244106	5246266	Every week you guys tweet us and we read your tweets.
5246887	5249568	Unless you're going to tweet something that we're going to talk about on the show in about 30 minutes.
5249748	5250028	Anyway.
5251389	5252149	I'm not Benji.
5252409	5253009	Sends us a tweet.
5253029	5253810	Well then who are you?
5254310	5256811	Sends us a tweet saying, can I pre-F you?
5257331	5260833	If so, F you to being at a place tonight where I can't listen to OLR.
5261213	5262073	That is screwed up.
5262714	5263054	F that.
5263974	5278867	I would say though, just a tip, if you are a smartphone owner, especially like the iPhones, I'm not sure how well this works on Android and the other stuff because I'm an iPhone owner, but allgames.com runs on HTML5, so you can actually get the feed by just going to allgames.com on your iPhone or whatever.
5278907	5280769	So just saying, just for future reference.
5282746	5285789	Bobby Blackwolf tweeted us that he has now sent the best email ever.
5286010	5287972	I'm looking forward to it.
5288152	5293857	Funny T-Man tweets us saying this is a fun little Metroidvania type game I found.
5294418	5296120	So I'm going to the link here.
5296320	5301745	It's IndieGames.com and the game is called Hydra Castle Labyrinth Buster.
5302826	5305147	Oh, maybe that's the author, I don't know, but Hydra Castle Labyrinth.
5305688	5312331	It's a freeware 2D platformer created by E. Hashimoto, who made Akuji the Demon and Guardian of Paradise.
5313752	5319855	It's similar to La Mulana, uh-oh, I hear Dark Tetsuya running to download this immediately, and the Castlevania series.
5320236	5324278	The health gauge and sub-weapon indicator are both displayed on the top left corner of the screen.
5325219	5342282	Hydra Castle Labyrinth you can download from Buster's site hp.vector.co.jp this sounds pretty cool and it's only 1.25 megs I will kindly link this in our chat room so if you guys want to check that out there you go enjoy
5344679	5346361	It sounds like Dark Tetsuya has already played it.
5346381	5347302	I'm so not surprised.
5347362	5348944	All right.
5349084	5350906	SJ100Matt tweets us a couple things.
5350986	5353288	One of them is coming up a little later in the show, but the other one I want to mention this.
5353649	5358674	With arcades being closed down, a new video game themed lounge has opened up in Las Vegas.
5358774	5359415	Looks nice.
5360075	5363059	You know, I heard there's a new arcade in San Francisco as well.
5363799	5381566	and I can't remember for the life of me what the name is maybe somebody in chat will figure it out for me but there's a new arcade in San Francisco I think I haven't been to yet and now apparently there's this place called Insert Coins in Las Vegas it's a video lounge game bar yeah I remember seeing that huh that sounds kind of neat a while ago
5382684	5403558	According to the website here that I'm on right now, Insert Coins will electrify all your senses with its revolutionary amalgamation of classic arcades, ultra lounge service, console video gaming, and the world's greatest video DJs, all under its 7,000 square foot roof, nestled in the iconic neon-laden Fremont East District of Las Vegas.
5404019	5405700	Actually sounds kind of awesome, I gotta say.
5406180	5410743	It sounds like it's video games meets booze meets loud music.
5411704	5439121	sounds awesome maybe this type of shit's ready to make a resurgence that's kind of what I'm hoping like you know I gotta say when I went to Portland one of the most awesome places I went to was the um barcade that they had there and I apologize I forget the name of it but it's just thank you ground control Dan's yelling it from the other room ground control yeah that place was isn't that place fucking rad Dan oh god Dan you gotta go oh my god it's it's beer and 80s games
5441368	5442649	All right, Dan says road trip.
5443989	5444830	We might just have to.
5444890	5445450	It's awesome.
5447491	5455154	Anyhow, you know, it's a bummer you're starting school that week because before we go to L.A., we could go to Portland and go to ground control.
5456114	5457815	You know, yeah, screw DarkSakura.
5457895	5458715	You and I will go, Dan.
5458916	5459216	Hey.
5462517	5464338	Dan and I are going to go on a broad trip.
5469824	5473689	Dan said the first gayest thing he did was play rock band at Matt's party.
5487657	5490620	Alright, let me move on to some more tweets.
5491541	5498288	Spazinator PSN tweets us saying, PlayStation Network is down again as of 9pm Eastern, 6pm Pacific.
5498689	5507378	And I was like, well wait a minute Spazinator, maybe you just need to try it four times before you get in like I had to do earlier, but I'm looking at the official PlayStation blog, guess what?
5508328	5511169	Yep, not even 24 hours after it came back up, PlayStation Network had to go back down.
5511190	5511950	Yep, yep, yep, yep.
5537878	5539139	and that's all I'm going to say about that.
5540021	5540841	What a whore.
5541122	5542323	More tweets.
5542443	5542664	What?
5542724	5543705	Did you call it a whore?
5543985	5544706	Exactly.
5544806	5545847	Had to go back down.
5551690	5553750	Hey, Tigerclaw sends us a couple tweets.
5553850	5555611	Oops, I guess I just reported on one of them.
5555631	5563292	But I'll read this other one about the Sony Online Entertainment senior producer is now the Zynga Austin GM.
5563472	5565313	That's John Blakely.
5565773	5569814	He did some projects including Star Wars Galaxies and DC Universe Onlines.
5570194	5572934	Now he's leading Zynga in Austin.
5573294	5576495	So he went from the dark side to the darker side.
5577595	5578695	All from his LinkedIn profile.
5580696	5581116	Let's see.
5582722	5587883	Candid Critique sends us a tweet saying, Someone makes Counter-Strike Osama compound map.
5588003	5588663	Yay or nay?
5589124	5592464	I thought something like this we had discussed on the show this week.
5592664	5594665	And this isn't all too surprising.
5595605	5599366	Give a bunch of gamers a blank palette and controversial things are sure to be made.
5599746	5607328	Everywhere from nude patches to overly violent things to real life scenarios that may or may not be kind of tacky playing out.
5607808	5617490	So, yeah, and we get linked to this article here about the Pakistani compound where Osama Bin Laden, of course, I mean, unless you've been living under a fucking rock, was found and killed by U.S.
5617530	5622791	Navy SEALs, is now a playable mod in, what is this, Counter-Strike.
5623591	5624111	Oh, great.
5624612	5633934	So I can go into Counter-Strike and play this game, and not only can I play real-life news, but I can get called every name in the book while doing it, because Counter-Strike has a really rude online community, just so you know.
5634774	5635214	Lastly...
5636414	5637535	Here's a question for the host.
5637635	5638555	I like these tweets.
5638995	5640316	They're questions for the host.
5640536	5641977	That's what this really should all be about.
5641997	5642497	But here you go.
5642877	5651421	TheBaconBits tweets us, IDK if it's been asked before, but what is your guys' favorite game soundtrack of all time?
5651981	5654642	Personally, mine is the SMG OST.
5654702	5657223	I'm assuming that means Super Mario Galaxy OST.
5657603	5661585	BaconBits asking, what is your favorite game soundtrack of all time?
5661905	5662465	DarkSakura?
5662485	5662505	I...
5670984	5676529	I really don't know, but I'd have to say maybe Bust Move 2.
5676789	5677710	Okay.
5678231	5679532	Because it had a really good soundtrack.
5680573	5680813	Loki?
5682870	5710519	I don't know it would have to be kind of a toss up between well I did like I listened the crap out of the Dance Dance Revolution 4th mix soundtrack when that was out because I actually bought that at an anime convention which is pretty awesome I'd say it's either between 4th, 5th, Max 2 or DJ Hero 1 because DJ Hero 2 is kind of dumb
5712356	5728489	As tempted as I am to throw in a Bomani soundtrack like DDR3rd Mix, probably my favorite soundtrack ever, or Beatmania 2D X-Fist style, honestly, I go to the Super Nintendo, and there's three games on the Super Nintendo that for me all kind of tie, maybe one slightly ahead for first place.
5728629	5730331	Actually, I'm going to add Super Metroid to the list.
5730471	5733173	Super Metroid would be on my top three, absolutely.
5734253	5738274	Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call it would also be up there.
5738654	5744615	But I think just the slight edge, I think probably the greatest video game soundtrack ever made, ActRaiser.
5746076	5747716	I love the ActRaiser soundtrack.
5747756	5749096	It is beautiful, gorgeous music.
5749136	5751777	You know what actually I'd have to add to my list would be Chrono Trigger.
5752477	5754738	Oh, Chrono Trigger's got a pretty fucking sweet soundtrack.
5754958	5757418	Link to a Pass is pretty awesome too.
5757598	5761259	I'm gonna find my favorite piece of music in Chrono Trigger and send it to you to play.
5762603	5763243	All right, you do that.
5764044	5766165	But maybe next week during the break.
5766645	5767946	We're out of music breaks tonight.
5768506	5770207	All right, that's going to do it for the tweets.
5770267	5772889	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get in early for next week.
5773169	5775230	In the meantime, more news.
5775570	5778051	And oh boy, it's the lawsuit segment time.
5778972	5779692	Yay.
5779812	5780292	Yay.
5780553	5784935	This is retarded, but a former Navy... Now, Loki, don't use the R word.
5786015	5786936	You can say butt-tarded.
5788783	5789443	It's retarded.
5806336	5810500	It was his first seizure he had ever had, and it was violent enough to break a bone.
5811982	5817407	And I guess he's permanently barred from flying the F-18 planes, which he was trained on.
5817868	5823494	And he's suing them because he says Oblivion was designed that it exceeds the upper acceptable limit of...
5824014	5825256	Bullshit, they're in the manual.
5825536	5828179	Every fucking manual has a goddamn epilepsy warning in it.
5847675	5850460	I'm sorry, that is some serious bullshit right there.
5851742	5856290	Anyways, he wants damages for negligence, breach of warranty, and product liability.
5859435	5860056	He's gonna lose.
5860973	5889468	but yeah, every goddamn manual and fuck, every goddamn manual like, since games had manuals have had that warning in there, I think like from the Nintendo, well I'm sure they've had manuals for games before that, but like Nintendo, I think was one of the first you know series of games or whatever, they had manuals that had that warning in there because I always thought it was ridiculous, but I mean people have seizures because of flashing lights sometimes, but
5891676	5894340	I'm sorry, just take some responsibility for yourself.
5908703	5910505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5927945	5928905	DarkSakura.com
5949413	5950574	I have thrown up.
5950614	5951795	Portal 2 made me throw up.
5951895	5954657	You have to control yourself.
5954898	5959061	Unfortunately, some people have limits and you've got to control those limits.
5960263	5962944	Turn the brightness down on your TV when you play Oblivion or something.
5962964	5968488	You can't blame a game for a problem that clearly existed before that.
5969849	5980896	You've got person A who has zero inclination towards epilepsy, and you've got person B who doesn't know they have any inclination towards epilepsy, but they do.
5981437	5983338	And you sit them both in front of the same product.
5983378	5989282	Well, of course, the one who has the inclination, whether they know about it or not, is going to react to it.
5990002	5992443	It's like how I found out I was allergic to bell peppers.
5993463	5993903	I didn't know.
5993963	5994683	My mom eats them.
5995403	5997823	I ate a bell pepper, my tongue swelled up, and I got sick.
5999304	5999584	You know?
6000644	6001444	Besides that, they're nasty.
6001724	6007825	Blackwolf in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, at least he got the seizure while playing a video game rather than while flying.
6008185	6015466	Yeah, so like I said, would you rather he fly in a plane and get a seizure than crash into, I don't know, an orphanage, a mall, children, schools?
6015586	6015967	No.
6019492	6022832	Anyhow, let's talk about another lawsuit, and this one, oh boy.
6023694	6026397	This is a lawsuit against Chuck E. Cheese.
6027197	6030020	Is it for the fact that they got rid of all their good arcade games?
6030100	6031781	Because I wanted to join in on that one.
6031962	6032882	Actually, sort of.
6034163	6041290	It's a lawsuit against the ticket dispensing games at Chuck E. Cheese because it creates gambling addiction in little children.
6041850	6043772	A lawsuit has been filed in California.
6044232	6046254	They're looking for $5 million.
6046374	6048496	The person who filed the lawsuit, Denise Keller.
6048536	6050978	She's a mom, two girls, five and three years old.
6051958	6055560	Chuck E. Cheese's arcade games are akin to slot machines, says the complaint.
6055960	6066525	By offering tickets as a payout that can be redeemed for prizes, the machines, quote, create the same highs and lows experienced by adults who gamble their paychecks or the mortgage payment.
6067185	6070707	The lawyer says, it's not about the money, it's about the kids.
6072167	6074448	California law forbids gambling
6096016	6101139	I get it, the Indian casinos are in Indian land, I understand that And the California lottery?
6101759	6105881	Yeah, the lottery, so they don't ban gambling that well, you know what I mean?
6107382	6119388	But anyhow, it does make an exception for payouts if the contest is predominantly a game of skill Which, as you know, these crane games and skee-ball games and so forth, they are of course mainly games of skill
6121130	6121971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6142288	6143229	I don't understand.
6144089	6146031	I don't even understand the problem here.
6146151	6152095	I actually would take an unpopular opinion somewhat with this and say she actually kind of has a point with this whole thing.
6152275	6155457	I do think this is probably not healthy for all children.
6155817	6156798	But at the same time.
6158007	6159748	Why sue Chuck E. Cheese over it?
6159788	6163850	That's ridiculous because you absolutely have the right to not go there.
6164010	6164731	And you know what?
6165091	6178839	I bet if enough people didn't go to Chuck E. Cheese and didn't go have their birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and let their kids have birthday parties there, they would probably have to get rid of these machines or the company would go bankrupt or maybe they'd go back to having legitimate arcade games.
6178999	6179439	I don't know.
6179679	6186365	I want to know why, you know, all of these, because Ticket Redemption games have been around forever since I was a little kid.
6186725	6186946	Right.
6187246	6188567	Well, that's not forever, don't say that.
6188747	6194412	Anyway, but why is it that we're just now getting somebody complaining about it?
6194572	6198436	I really don't get it, especially when everybody else seems to be just fine with it.
6198476	6200998	People can get addicted to anything.
6201018	6201979	I'm not finished.
6202279	6202539	Sorry.
6202579	6202940	Thank you.
6204941	6206682	The whole point is that it's a parenting issue.
6207802	6211765	You don't want your kids to participate in something, you don't take them there, or you don't let them play it.
6213025	6216107	Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Many ticket games are a test of skill.
6216607	6218628	Some ticket games are goddamn bullshit.
6218888	6219169	Agreed.
6219909	6224391	The Legend of Zaku says, Remember kids, America equals Sue the Bastard's Land.
6224692	6225832	You know, he kind of has a point.
6225952	6229494	I almost think she's teaching these kids a worse lesson by going through with this lawsuit.
6229914	6230615	This is my opinion.
6231255	6232235	Well, that's the way it is now.
6232295	6237458	If people find an opportunity to make money, they're going to gamble their chances and do it.
6237538	6243220	I mean, people can make the argument that they can be addicted to anything.
6244181	6245841	So we get rid of everything?
6245941	6247842	Because that's really what it's going to come down to.
6247882	6252364	You get rid of these ticket redemption games, they're going to say, oh, well, I'm addicted to winning at arcade games.
6252744	6254165	Then you get rid of the arcade games.
6254465	6255806	Oh, well, I'm addicted to...
6258155	6258716	I don't know.
6259956	6264800	Riding in little motorized cars that they have at Chuck E. Cheese or something like that.
6264820	6266441	Well, then we gotta get rid of those too.
6266581	6268843	Oh, well, now I'm addicted to eating pizza.
6268883	6269924	Let's get rid of pizza.
6270524	6271385	Where does it stop?
6271485	6275848	I mean, it's just people are gonna be finding anything to sue over.
6276628	6281532	And this, unfortunately, is the latest in many, I'm sure, lawsuits that are gonna be
6283831	6284612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6302352	6303553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6324608	6325709	Thanks for watching!
6340840	6344042	And if they cry and have a tantrum, then you give them a timeout or you spank them.
6344222	6347724	Is it seriously that terrible to parent your child?
6347804	6352426	I mean, shit, I know as being a parent, it's not that hard to say no.
6352586	6354427	And not only a parent, a Mensa member.
6358354	6359115	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6376918	6379859	Can I lie and say I'm a Mensa member and just say as a Mensa member?
6379939	6381839	I'll get sued, probably.
6381859	6383139	No, no, no, no, no.
6383179	6384920	There's some hilarious shit in here.
6384940	6386500	Just sorry to get sidetracked here very quick.
6386520	6388420	Let's go ahead and read this comment real quick.
6388560	6390821	AkumaJP in our chatroom at chat.orangehauntry.com.
6391061	6392961	Loki is addicted to Grand Theft Auto for sure.
6393581	6393921	Oh, yeah.
6394101	6394801	I don't know.
6395301	6401603	Seriously, I spend an unhealthy amount of my day thinking about Grand Theft Auto, playing Grand Theft Auto.
6401623	6403523	I may or may not be addicted to World of Warcraft.
6404305	6407888	and let's face it, everyone is addicted to video games.
6407968	6411050	No, no, it's not that I'm addicted to Grand Theft Auto.
6411310	6414972	I have fun playing Grand Theft Auto and I have fun modding Grand Theft Auto.
6415352	6418234	Why is that a problem that I like doing something, you know?
6418654	6419795	It's not like I can't stop.
6419815	6420796	You're not allowed to have fun!
6424458	6424858	Okay.
6427162	6428363	I'm just going to tell you something.
6428404	6429405	It's just really hilarious.
6429445	6432067	I got to find, and my wife was reading this to me.
6432088	6433249	Oh, here it is.
6433389	6435511	I think this is it right here.
6437413	6440497	There's some rules or whatever that they have.
6441738	6443460	Oh, member policies.
6443700	6444541	Let's see here.
6445282	6446183	Are you allowed to read these?
6447796	6450597	Well, it's not like it's some secret guide or something.
6450617	6455719	That's not masonry.
6455800	6463463	Okay, anyways, one of the things, yeah, you can't really say something as like saying, oh, well, as a member of Mensa, I believe blah, blah, blah.
6464343	6466724	But that wasn't even the part that I thought was ridiculous.
6466764	6468485	They give you a sample press.
6468505	6470025	I kid you not.
6470145	6477408	A sample press release of how you can form your own press release to send out to your local paper and your friends saying that you got in the Mensa.
6477768	6478829	No, I'm not that vain.
6479049	6479369	Sorry.
6480289	6481770	You know what though?
6481810	6489255	Maybe in a suburbia town, in a big market like Sacramento, as much as we joke about ourselves, we are still the 20th largest market in the nation.
6489275	6493017	But go to the Midwest, in a lot of those little towns, maybe it is kind of a big deal.
6493037	6497821	That's just like putting a big giant sign on my back that says, Nerd!
6498241	6499622	Make fun of me!
6500943	6502864	Beat my ass while you're at it!
6503224	6507687	I'm sorry, I'm not going to invite that kind of attention.
6509426	6509806	All right.
6510327	6514789	Well, the next story up is DarkSakura's, but she's left, so... She has left the building.
6514809	6518111	Let's talk more about... Let's sue her for not fulfilling her obligations.
6518131	6520613	I'm addicted to garden burgers, and I was preparing mine.
6520893	6521213	All right.
6522434	6523034	So, you know what?
6523074	6523334	That's it.
6523354	6524135	I'm suing garden burgers.
6524155	6525596	We're going to get rid of those crappy garden burgers.
6525616	6526777	Goddamn you, garden burgers.
6527057	6528237	I'm suing you because I thought you were meat.
6528257	6531519	Portal 2 Authoring Tools is now available for beta for PC gamers.
6532100	6533100	Shut up, Dan!
6534481	6535022	I love you!
6537083	6537343	Okay.
6537363	6537443	Okay.
6539739	6567580	so for people who want to do more for Portal 2 Valve has Portal 2 authoring tools yay if you've got a PC you can do this it's free for anyone who owns the game on PC and it's in the tools tab on your Steam account so basically you'll just be able to go into everything character skins, single player co-op levels, sound effects, music, 3D models they are all there you can do them all but there's also that sounds nasty
6569341	6577065	There's also an updated version of Faceposer and different example maps and instances to help you learn.
6578106	6581848	Also, there's a new suite of command line compiling utilities.
6584709	6586390	I want someone to make the Orange Lounge level.
6587530	6588831	Make the Orange Lounge level, put it up.
6592535	6592855	All right.
6592916	6593837	Why are you looking at doors?
6594457	6595899	I'm looking at something from online.
6596880	6599423	Something that Alan's doing.
6599483	6599783	All right.
6600204	6600744	Moving on.
6601285	6602647	He's probably giggling that that came out.
6602707	6602987	All right.
6603608	6604268	Moving on.
6604669	6605490	Loki, what do you have for us?
6605990	6606851	Yes.
6607572	6609815	So this is kind of funny.
6610035	6612237	Apparently the PlayStation 1 Classics...
6613098	6615180	They've been slow to sell.
6616462	6624730	Really, no one's wanting to buy your PlayStation 1 games to play them on a device that most likely doesn't have buttons.
6625230	6631356	But no, these are actually meant for the Xperia Play Phone, the PlayStation phone, if you will.
6632217	6640502	Um, apparently, I guess, there's only, um, you know, very few, uh, sales for each one.
6640602	6651249	They're saying that under a thousand installs for each title, uh, Cool Porters 2, Destruction Derby, Medieval, Siphon Filter, and Jumping Flash, and most of those are actually only in the few hundreds.
6652269	6664701	Um, they're saying that also that, um, they're saying it's not really a concern since there's only a few, um, at the, um, moment, but PlayStation 1 titles, um, here are there.
6665181	6671547	There's more coming on a regular basis, he said, and as a whole PlayStation as a content provider exclusive to the device.
6671988	6673329	So there's no real concerns.
6673389	6677473	It's a revolutionary device and it's shaking up the marketplace and we're very pleased with it.
6678353	6683036	Um, also it should be meant, you know, there's a reason why that maybe it's not working.
6683076	6689500	It's because, um, not necessarily on the marketplace, but you can get it for that phone.
6690140	6696104	Um, there actually are other PlayStation emulators that you can download ROMs for, and those don't cost you anything.
6698645	6699586	So maybe that's the issue.
6700246	6705249	I think a lot of people are just buying the phone because, you know what, it's kind of cool to play other games with buttons.
6707657	6708117	Xperia Play Fine
6734637	6741823	Just because it has a PlayStation controller setup on it doesn't mean people are going to necessarily buy just PlayStation 1 games with it.
6742263	6750430	I mean, you can get a bunch of other games that support this type of controller mapping and you can play those just fine.
6750831	6756696	Have you ever thought that maybe a game that was put out 10 years ago might not stand up well against...
6757476	6758297	some of the newer games.
6758417	6761880	Yeah, I think Sony's just losing touch there with what people want.
6762120	6769886	Granted, Cool Borders is a pretty fun game and Destruction Derby's not bad on its own and Medieval's alright, but I don't know.
6770006	6771968	It's just they're showing their age.
6775591	6777893	But you know, Kazurai's a real party animal.
6777993	6779834	He's hip to what the kids are into.
6780235	6781356	Exactly.
6781496	6785839	He's got his finger on the pulse of what's hot.
6785859	6786820	What gamers really want
6788579	6789162	Absolutely.
6790265	6792533	When he's not partying in his yacht.
6793938	6798280	Let's talk about the Xbox for a minute and their Games on Demand service.
6798380	6802241	Of course, you can buy full games through the Games on Demand service and download them to your hard drive.
6802761	6804822	Usually, these are games that have been out for a little while.
6804862	6808123	You don't see a lot of stuff that comes out as they're new, but this is interesting.
6808843	6815146	Cave is going to be releasing Death Smiles 2X directly to Games on Demand.
6815186	6817667	There will not be a disc release in North America.
6818307	6819267	The game will cost $30, excuse me, $29.99.
6821668	6822689	They're not translating it.
6822909	6824550	It's going to be straight up in Japanese.
6824610	6829532	You are buying basically the import game, but playable on your Xbox 360 through Games on Demand.
6829993	6834155	But because it's a shooter game, it's not like you need to have a real thorough knowledge of Japanese anyhow.
6834295	6836496	You have to have no knowledge of Japanese, seriously.
6836516	6839658	It's going to launch Tuesday, May 17th.
6839958	6841919	Facebook is where they announced this.
6841979	6843200	Boy, what a sign of the times.
6843260	6850724	Cave announced this on Facebook, saying, quote, It will be giving this format a try for getting some of our Japan-only shooters released overseas.
6851671	6852752	I have to be honest.
6854273	6856915	It's kind of a neat idea.
6857095	6864179	There's a lot of people that really like import games and would like to be playing them, and it sucks that the Xbox is region locked the way it is.
6864339	6865980	And import games are fucking expensive.
6866101	6876247	So $30 for a game like that, even if they aren't doing any translations whatsoever, it's awesome because you're saving yourself probably about...
6879150	6891583	50% of the cost of an import actually more than that probably this would actually kind of discourage some of the hacking because sometimes people hack their systems to play import games that's the reason why I hacked my original Playstation 1
6893573	6894914	So, there you go.
6896915	6897395	Interesting.
6898515	6900536	Maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale, eventually.
6900656	6900536	$30?
6900696	6901577	I don't know.
6902177	6903738	I'm not super good at shooters.
6904438	6905738	Also, you know what's interesting about this?
6905778	6909380	By not getting a disc release, you won't be able to get it through Gamefly or anything like that.
6909640	6910040	Or rental.
6910661	6912661	You have to either pay the $30 or don't play.
6913602	6914882	We'll see how well that goes over.
6915723	6917504	Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
6918726	6920127	Every week you guys send us emails.
6920207	6929596	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out a few emails that she says, hey, you guys should be writing us more emails.
6931878	6932178	First email.
6935734	6938516	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here with a question for you all.
6939277	6944241	After having done this radio show for a long time, do you ever get that itch to work closer to the video game industry?
6944721	6945382	No, not at all.
6945982	6954149	I mean, I know that Loki works in distribution, but do any of you feel like you would enjoy having a hand in a game's development rather than simply reporting the news and your opinions?
6954629	6957652	Or do you prefer to stay at arm's length and pay no mind to the man behind the curtain?
6958372	6964938	Absolutely, and I've already pitched the idea that I want to pitch an idea to Konami to...
6966638	6992120	you know it's tough actually going up to them and saying listen I want to fix your franchise because they don't really take kindly to that kind of stuff but reimagine and modernize a franchise I suppose would be the better way to do it but yeah I'd love to do that but uh at the same time you know I have a day job so it'd be kind of hard to quit a day job to go work on a game and god knows they're not going to actually listen to one person that has an idea about how they can
6992740	7003356	improve a certain franchise because I'm sure they get thousands of emails from people that do something very similar but if they were ballsy and wanted to take a chance that'd be pretty cool
7004042	7004582	Thanks for watching!
7028098	7029899	So, OLR men and women, what are your thoughts?
7029939	7033920	Are you content to admire the industry from afar or do you want to dive into the trenches?
7033980	7038541	Yours truly is EHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient and general grammar advocate.
7038922	7039182	P.S.
7039242	7042563	I've started a scientific poll on my Facebook to prove that everyone appreciates boobs.
7043423	7047484	Aside from the insignificant outliner data, the results support OLR's hypothesis.
7047865	7051646	Feel free to share it in chat so that I can obtain more data and I will copy it into chat.
7051726	7052146	There you go.
7052666	7066536	Also, I actually, if certain things require a relocation on our part, I'm planning on applying with Valve, Nintendo, and Microsoft.
7067337	7069438	Because what I want to do is publication.
7069478	7071620	Gee, I wonder if she might be thinking of relocating too.
7074122	7082565	I'm wanting to do publication, like manuals, advertising, anything that's going to go into digital or physical print.
7084786	7086627	I have to admit, I'm a little torn on it.
7087007	7088568	I honestly have to say no.
7088848	7091449	I don't think there's a lot I could contribute on the front lines.
7091489	7092389	I'm not a programmer.
7092429	7093190	I'm not an artist.
7093610	7096071	Sure, I have ideas about games, but you know what?
7096671	7099572	Some people kind of do it a little bit better, and I'm okay with that.
7099752	7102033	I would have no problem being an advisor personally.
7102233	7102834	A tracker.
7102914	7108000	Hell, having done this show as long as I have, I think I could probably get away with being some type of games analyst.
7108020	7110282	But at the same time, I have a day job I rather enjoy.
7111103	7112384	I make a decent amount of money.
7113085	7115468	I don't really see myself leaving it anytime soon.
7116027	7132332	However, I'm not going to lie, especially from the journalism ends of things, if I ever had the opportunity to host a show about games, especially on TV, although there's such little demand for that, I don't know how that would ever happen, I would jump at that opportunity in a heartbeat, absolutely.
7132452	7135272	Although I worry I'm starting to get a little old for that.
7135292	7136673	A lot of that stuff is targeted towards...
7137453	7139114	You know, 20-somethings and teens.
7139254	7141236	And now I'm starting to enter my mid-30s.
7141316	7144638	So I don't know if I would really be wanted for that.
7145098	7148140	I would tell you what I would love, love, love to do more than anything.
7148500	7149901	I would love to host a game show.
7150942	7153423	Especially like a throwback to the old Starrcade.
7153443	7155204	Because Rob's here with Bob Barker.
7155444	7157686	Even something like Nick Arcade or something like that.
7157706	7158646	You want to be painted orange.
7158666	7163789	I love Bob Barker, but I also love Gene Rayburn from old 70s match game.
7163829	7164510	Like I would say...
7165000	7166021	You know who my person is?
7166841	7167882	Dude from Press Your Luck.
7168403	7169704	Oh, Peter Tamarkin.
7171885	7177249	So yeah, I would absolutely leave my day job in a heartbeat to go be a game show host.
7177289	7184515	In fact, I actually had an old boss who thought she heard of some TV station casting for who wants to be a game show host.
7184895	7194967	and she told me I could take leave from work to participate in that show and she said that it's possible to be arranged unfortunately that show didn't turn out to be legit but if they ever had something like that I'd go on it in a heartbeat absolutely
7196080	7200561	But at the same time, you know, we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio as a hobby for nine years now.
7201182	7206083	And just radio in general, you know, I was on Understated Nation Live before that and was doing college radio before that.
7206543	7209764	Like, the radio industry especially is highly competitive.
7210244	7213565	And I kind of like the fact that we get to do radio on our own terms.
7214025	7215746	Yeah, we're not the biggest show out there.
7216126	7219167	A lot of people, even after nine years, have no idea who the fuck we are.
7219487	7222188	But nobody gets between me and you.
7222668	7223949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
7247452	7250034	Absolutely, which is why we'll probably be independent forever.
7250134	7255537	But that's, I think it's the way at least ye small but loyal few like it.
7255897	7257718	And that's how we roll.
7258058	7258919	That and we have Shermie.
7260159	7261600	We'll always have Shermie.
7261880	7263621	Yeah.
7264101	7265022	Dan says we'd sell out.
7265062	7265902	I think he's full of crap.
7268729	7272790	If it happened and you guys didn't take the money, I would kill all three of you
7294838	7295359	Hold on, hold on.
7295479	7296521	Dan said that on the mic.
7297081	7298223	I think he might have got picked up.
7300187	7302110	My husband likes to just come in here and shout things.
7302130	7304073	He said if we didn't take the money, he'd kill all of us.
7305115	7305996	I will say this, though.
7306056	7307439	There's definitely, I think...
7308755	7313798	I think one thing we always want to make sure we do here at Orange Lounge Radio is we don't want to rest on our laurels too much.
7314038	7320643	And I think if there's ways we can push things forward and push ourselves more and push the hobby forward, we're going to try and do that.
7320983	7328988	So I'm not saying anything, but trust me, we're always thinking about how can things be even better than they are right now.
7329548	7330049	Better.
7331429	7332090	But on our terms.
7333251	7334411	Very important on our terms.
7334431	7334551	Okay.
7336707	7336887	Yes.
7337888	7338348	Next email.
7338488	7338708	Yes.
7339749	7354236	Destructoid article that's linked by... I was getting my... Originally scheduled for launch sometime this month, Nintendo has pushed back the already late release because it should have been ready when the damn system was out of the 3DS eShop until June.
7354436	7358038	According to the company, North America will get it June 6th and Japan will get it June 7th.
7358638	7359498	Hey, we get it first.
7359558	7359799	Neener.
7360959	7362861	Well, technically, it's sort of at the same time.
7363381	7369347	I was emailing a friend about this, and I also mentioned the big three addresses by Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, respectively.
7369947	7379135	I realized that the eShop will open on the day Microsoft and Sony talk, June 6th, USA, June 7th, Japan.
7379215	7379896	How clever.
7380196	7382158	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
7383701	7384524	Last two emails.
7385347	7387232	I'm glad they finally got it back up.
7387453	7389018	This is called Thoughts on PSN.
7390182	7390924	They got it up.
7392165	7393005	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7418132	7422513	Michael Patcher did a 24 plus minute video on how this will impact Sony.
7423094	7424234	A very interesting watch.
7424274	7428535	He certainly feels that while they lost money slash sales, they'll be fine.
7428695	7430816	Here's the link and I will copy it into the chat room.
7430916	7438118	But for those listening, it's GameTrailers.com slash video slash episode dash 215 dash patch.
7439038	7440879	I guess P-A-C-H is how it's written on there.
7441259	7443139	Dash attack slash 713900.
7443199	7444120	So they're giving...
7445060	7447121	I'm giving the analyst video time now, too.
7447501	7450683	I assume if you just go to GameTrailers.com and search for his name, you'll find it.
7450703	7452984	Well, yeah, but I... But, I mean... Ben Thoreau!
7454084	7460107	I don't want to be a hater, but how is this guy any different from the indie podcasts out there and all the speculation they do?
7460347	7464769	Like, I realize maybe he went to school or whatever, but... I get played by Morgan... What was it?
7465309	7466510	Webbrush or whatever?
7466610	7468050	I'm really not trying to be a hater.
7468130	7469451	Like, everybody's got to make a living.
7469511	7470031	I get that.
7470071	7471472	But I don't... Like, why is his...
7471852	7475495	Dude, the guy is wrong more times than he's right.
7476876	7477396	I don't care.
7477476	7478777	I'm just reading the email.
7478877	7479458	No, I know.
7479558	7480779	I'm responding to the email.
7480799	7481119	Take care.
7481159	7482420	Listen to the podcast every week.
7482460	7483240	Keep up the good work.
7483300	7484041	And that's from Sepwin.
7485268	7485949	I will say this, though.
7485989	7487530	I do kind of agree.
7487590	7489892	I think Sony is going to recover from it in the long run.
7490232	7491974	I think they're going to feel a lot of hurt.
7492474	7497218	And the real question might be, is Sony going to find this worth it to do it all over again with PlayStation 4?
7498399	7501141	But I think at the end of the day, yes.
7502042	7504304	I think they will recover.
7504945	7511410	If Apple recovered from the antenna thing, if Microsoft recovered from the red ring thing, they'll come back.
7511883	7512343	It's Sony.
7512744	7517468	You know they've already got a business, they've already adjusted their business model to accommodate.
7519530	7520911	Also, Bobby.
7522753	7524714	Did you know that PSN is back up?
7525215	7527677	And did you know that it still does not deliver tacos?
7528077	7530279	I am sad, frown face, all caps, Bobby.
7532141	7532741	I had to yell.
7532841	7534883	That possibly is the best email ever, actually.
7537301	7537981	That is very sad.
7538001	7539022	That was my Caps Lock voice.
7539142	7542143	I want tacos as part of my PlayStation Severance package.
7542183	7542944	Can we get on that?
7543064	7544224	I only got four emails, Rob.
7544945	7545885	Well, we need more emails.
7546645	7547946	That's why you didn't get tacos tonight.
7549807	7552508	Send me more emails so that Rob will get me another taco.
7553428	7557150	Send me emails so that DarkSakura buys me a taco.
7557590	7561772	I'll buy you a taco if you buy me a taco.
7562152	7563873	Dan says he's going to make tacos next week.
7564173	7564453	Awesome.
7565014	7565394	Rad.
7566840	7568821	All right, we're almost to the Skype line.
7568881	7570742	Not just yet, but we will be there in just a moment.
7570762	7574383	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7574403	7576424	But first, two more stories for you.
7579826	7582547	So this is kind of neat, though.
7582587	7588510	As part of the Xbox indie service, it's been very unpredictable when games are going to be released on there.
7588890	7592632	It's kind of like, well, they're up for review now, so it should be out hopefully soon.
7593072	7594892	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7612037	7613038	That's kind of neat, I guess.
7613718	7620744	I guess such events like the Indie Games Winter Uprising will be more coordinated.
7623426	7630672	I guess some of their titles were missed on that because of the release date whole thing.
7633363	7639047	They're saying also it's kind of mixed a positive feedback according to the development community.
7640188	7647673	Some people like the decision and saying that the chance to schedule a release helps them plan the game promotion more sensibly.
7648193	7658941	Others noted that scheduling would likely lead to an open stampede to release on specific days like Friday and a game of chicken trying to figure out the best time.
7660321	7660661	and DarkSakura.
7680106	7683887	It looks like we're okay right now looking at the numbers, but we were having a skippy period for a minute there.
7684928	7688429	Anyhow, moving on, but otherwise there's not a lot we can do about it.
7688509	7690770	If the cable's not going to cooperate, then it's not going to cooperate.
7690850	7697052	So we move on with one last story here tonight before we go to the Skype line, which if we're still skipping is really going to be a hoot and a holler tonight.
7697592	7699093	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7723090	7749979	uh anyhow uh they're not it's just a straight up release of the Super Nintendo version so don't expect anything fabulous to be changed that means you're not going to have the extra dungeons and stuff in the DS version but there you go uh it is coming out no price announced yet but everybody is speculating it'll be 900 Wii points 800 for a Super Nintendo game and that 100 point premium for the special of the special games which honestly Chrono Trigger it's probably worth it so uh I'm sure there'll be a lot of people checking that out
7750339	7757623	and especially if you were too young to remember Chrono Trigger or just never got a chance to play it back in the day, you really should check it out.
7758063	7770810	I know I sometimes hate on it on the show because I don't think it's the best Super Nintendo RPG because I love Final Fantasy 3 too goddamn much, or 6, whatever you want to call it, but it's really good.
7770830	7771591	It's really good.
7771691	7772511	You want to know what's great?
7772691	7772892	Huh.
7773972	7780018	Now keep in mind that I got the game in 95, 96 when it came out.
7780038	7782220	Well, first of all, my friend loaned it to me and then he moved.
7783741	7785322	My save file is still intact.
7786623	7787044	Oh, wow.
7787384	7787624	Yeah.
7787704	7795091	Well, you know, a lot about those batteries were only ever guaranteed to last five years, but most people I know with old NES cartridges, those things still work.
7795311	7796812	Yeah, it's just a lithium battery.
7796832	7798054	It depends on how much you used it.
7798254	7799975	Yeah, I mean, as long as you don't have the game on 24-7.
7801653	7801893	Yeah.
7802113	7803454	So, interesting.
7804475	7807477	Now, our Saturn batteries, however, have burned and burned and burned and burned.
7807837	7808158	All right.
7808218	7814302	We are going to now open the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7814322	7817464	I'm going to really hope our live transmit issues don't get in the way.
7818024	7819525	But the Skype... Oh, excuse me.
7819565	7819806	Hiccups.
7820786	7828148	The Skype line is now open for your calls if you want to give feedback on any of tonight's topics or anything else that might be on your mind.
7828288	7829489	Look at that, it's already ringing.
7829929	7833270	We will of course also go to Loki with some last minute stories in between calls.
7833650	7834890	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
7835491	7837211	It's the one and only Ranma, how's everyone tonight?
7837231	7838832	Who else gets in first on this show?
7838872	7839452	How are you Ranma?
7840412	7840952	I'm pretty good.
7840992	7842213	I'm pretty happy.
7842293	7842633	That's all.
7843013	7843533	You're happy?
7843593	7844193	Why are you happy?
7844713	7846174	I start a new job come tomorrow.
7846194	7847554	Oh, well, that's a reason to be happy.
7847594	7848354	Congratulations.
7848795	7849175	Thank you.
7849335	7851775	What kind of job are you going to be doing, if you don't mind me asking?
7852536	7858517	I'll still be doing tech support in the school district, but with a different company with a lot more pay and better benefits.
7858677	7860498	Well, more pay and better benefits are always a good thing.
7860518	7860918	Congrats.
7861653	7863014	Thanks for watching!
7882481	7891826	What I see is it's probably going to be like a simple controller with a touch screen in the middle of it kind of preset for certain buttons to do certain things according to the way the game is going to be.
7892626	7893546	I can actually agree with that.
7893566	7896548	It seems like almost everything has a touch screen in this day and age.
7896668	7898769	Pretty much every smartphone these days has one.
7899569	7909694	Like I was talking about earlier when we were talking about the new Nintendo console in the first place, the touch screens on the printer devices and those things.
7910115	7910895	Yeah, I've seen those.
7912170	7933243	so yeah I don't think the touchscreens will be that expensive it's just you know all this other stuff too you know pretty much so what do you what are your expectations for the new Nintendo console we are only three weeks away from E3 they're saying it's going to be on par with the 360 and the PS3 just show me what it can do
7934935	7951882	and what and the features that's it I'm a very simple person with basic needs I mean if there's gonna be some great gaming on it I will pick up the console if it's going to be the Wii second gen with more more shovelware it can stay on the shelf and collect more dust
7954819	7956380	Well, you know the golden rule of OLR.
7956400	7958120	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
7958661	7959301	Yes, indeed.
7959381	7961061	That's a problem with the 3DS right now, too.
7961101	7964563	You know I left my 3DS here after the show last week and never bothered to come get it.
7964583	7965323	Well, actually, that's a lie.
7965343	7968844	I did try to come by Monday, but nobody was here because I was in the neighborhood.
7969165	7971085	Quite understandable.
7971245	7972526	I didn't really miss it that much.
7973366	7978229	I took mine out of my bag because I didn't like lugging it back and forth around because I'm not using it.
7978370	7979971	Now I have no one to street pass with.
7980391	7980991	Oh, darn.
7982092	7982993	You're going to street pass with me.
7983013	7983473	Take it to E3.
7983513	7986075	Try a street pass with people there.
7986435	7987376	You're going to loiter outside E3?
7987396	7988496	Bobby will street pass with me.
7989797	7991959	Yeah, I'm going to loiter outside E3 just to street pass.
7992239	7994220	I'm just going to walk around with a big cardboard sign.
7994680	7995261	I should do this.
7995561	7996622	Big cardboard sign.
7997242	7999664	Media not good enough to get into E3.
7999764	8000905	Please street pass with me.
8004986	8005667	That would be fun.
8006327	8006647	Wow.
8007607	8007867	Anyhow.
8008067	8009828	Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Ranma?
8010908	8013589	Yes, in regards to PAX East 2012.
8014609	8014809	Yes.
8016209	8016569	Okay.
8017090	8025192	I expect this to be announced soon, but I don't know if you know, but next year, PAX East is the same weekend as Anime Boston.
8026132	8028533	Same city, two separate convention centers.
8029013	8029633	Oh my god.
8029693	8030153	Yeah.
8032372	8034515	That's going to be a mess.
8034715	8036417	That is bad planning.
8036517	8037078	I'm sorry.
8037138	8038339	That is bad planning.
8040702	8042144	Yeah, I know.
8042284	8048131	But the problem is sometimes when the conventions have these dates, it's like take it or leave it, you know?
8048192	8050354	So that's probably what it boiled down to.
8050374	8050795	Mm-hmm.
8052827	8064778	But here's the thing, this was announced at Anime Boston's Masquerade, and I actually talked to a few people that are staff, and that was it, that actually verified this, but it will not surprise me if this changes.
8065499	8077891	They made the announcement that if you purchase a pass for Anime Boston 2012, it is good for entrance to PAX East 2012 as well, and they will have shuttle buses going between both convention centers.
8079443	8084513	That's a little weird to me considering the attendance caps that PAX keeps hitting.
8084913	8091526	Like, why would you want to, you know, because if everybody who goes to Anime Boston gets a free pass into PAX...
8092045	8093906	That's less people that can go to PAX.
8094866	8098727	So that seems like, if I were on the PAX, I wouldn't agree to that.
8099647	8100707	If I were behind that show.
8101808	8105329	I figure it's like, you know, you got so many gamers going to this convention.
8105589	8107989	You got so many anime fans going to this convention.
8108509	8111390	Give them a free pass to check out the other side, per se.
8111430	8112190	Well, then why not?
8112671	8114051	Is the other half going to be true, too?
8115688	8117489	It would not surprise me if it is.
8117729	8122811	But correct me if I'm wrong, Anime Boston is going to be at the old convention center, the Heinz, right?
8123091	8123311	Yes.
8123411	8127372	And then the Uber one that PAX was at this year is where PAX will be.
8127852	8130413	What if everybody decides to go to Anime Boston one of those days?
8130473	8132114	I mean that Heinz place is going to collapse.
8133451	8141378	Honestly, with the numbers that PAX East generates, I find that hard to believe because I'm planning to do PAX East instead.
8141738	8154909	And knowing how some fans are, how lazy they can be per se, no offense, but to be perfectly honest, I don't think a lot of them are going to take shuttle buses to go 15 minutes across town to another convention and then come back.
8155109	8156210	One of the two needs to move.
8156850	8157351	End of story.
8157451	8158411	One of the two needs to move.
8158852	8160113	They shouldn't be the same weekend.
8161016	8166039	I know, but this is what I'm hearing from a lot of my sources that this could be the end for AEB.
8166079	8166559	Who knows?
8167160	8167840	Well, then move.
8168741	8169121	You know?
8170902	8171382	I don't know.
8171522	8173003	That's going to be tricky.
8173183	8175364	It's going to be an interesting weekend next year.
8176125	8176385	I know.
8176785	8179387	I am curious to see how this is all going to play out.
8179447	8182689	It's still a long ways away, all things considered, so some things may change.
8182729	8183089	We'll see.
8184229	8186951	I don't doubt your sources, but I'm still skeptical.
8187031	8189853	It seems like wishful thinking on Anime Boston's part.
8190413	8193916	I know, it wouldn't surprise me as if, like, AB says this is what they're going to do.
8193956	8199219	Wouldn't surprise me if Paxix comes out and says, yeah, you buy one of our badges, it's not good for AB.
8199399	8207045	Maybe they're trying to be all buddy-buddy, friendly-friendly, because you have two different convention companies in the same town.
8207861	8211344	fighting for Top Dog, or in this case, a one-legged ass-kicking contest.
8211684	8229436	Yeah, and I was going to say, you'd think in most situations the two would be fighting each other, but I'm sorry, anime fans, Pax, with the people that come as far away as they do, you know, all the way from, like, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and all, like, the southern east states, you know, because that's still the closest thing they've got.
8230016	8230576	I'm sorry.
8231237	8234579	Anime Boston's going to get their ass handed to them if they stay that same weekend.
8234639	8241401	and you're absolutely right but the funny thing is there are people that travel as far south as Florida and Texas that come up to Anime Boston.
8241741	8242381	Why do they do it?
8242621	8243242	For the guests.
8243642	8250164	But for next year you may travel way across the country for the guests but as for me I'll travel way across the country to check out these great games.
8250484	8250684	Yeah.
8251344	8251564	True.
8251764	8251944	True.
8252024	8252224	Alright.
8252264	8254285	We gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks so much buddy.
8254825	8255425	Hey no problem dude.
8255485	8255765	Take care.
8255905	8256085	Bye.
8256306	8257426	Alright.
8257466	8257866	Later.
8257886	8261607	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8262627	8264388	Loki any last minute stories while we wait for a call?
8264902	8265663	The Royal Wedding
8286438	8290999	Yes, it will allow players to replace either Prince William or Kate Milton.
8291119	8292880	Wait, I can be Princess Kate?
8293060	8295000	You can be Princess Kate, yes.
8295661	8298741	In their first public kiss following the royal wedding.
8298981	8299401	Wow.
8299862	8303843	It says the scene's offered free, clearly an attempt to subvert otherwise rational people.
8303923	8305203	I'm not sure how I feel about that.
8305243	8306083	Let's go back to the phones.
8306123	8307024	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8307044	8307404	Who's this?
8309264	8310124	Oh, I thought I had a call.
8310264	8310704	I guess not.
8310945	8311485	I guess I missed it.
8311525	8311765	Sorry.
8311945	8312545	You can keep going.
8313722	8317246	So yeah, apparently there's going to be some other footage and stuff that's available.
8317487	8319188	But seriously though, I've played Ysar 2.
8320310	8323754	It's a cool concept, but it's so terribly executed.
8324655	8326637	It's such a terrible game.
8327037	8330421	My favorite is how the camera cannot frame you properly.
8331142	8331222	Um...
8333971	8338915	Deathwishing I'm playing a very amazing gem of a game that people need to start playing again Freelancer
8360089	8378093	It's a PC game from 2004, I believe, and it's kind of, say, like, EVE Online, minus being an MMORPG, but you can play with, like, 200 people online at once, and you do missions, I think, like, Neverwinter Nights kind of style, you know, you can do missions and stuff, all that, but it's space combat.
8378573	8380353	Oh, yeah, okay.
8380413	8381174	It's pretty fun.
8382254	8387475	Anyways, that Nintendo thing, I'm...
8388564	8392067	I'm kind of looking, I'm totally seeing fail in the future.
8392967	8393848	Why so negative?
8395209	8403475	Well, it's like, they're saying, oh, it's going to be like on par with PS3, Xbox 360, but then you see the thing about, oh, we're going to be inventing some new peripheral where you can like feel things.
8403535	8405036	I'm like, oh, great.
8412427	8415568	I kind of think the feel thing is bullshit.
8415748	8417569	I truly think the feel thing is bullshit.
8417589	8422051	That's not coming from the same source that originally leaked the news about the Nintendo Wii Next system.
8422071	8425652	That came from a different source.
8425752	8431274	I think the feel stuff holds about as much weight as the fact that the revolution was going to project 3D graphics.
8431294	8431714	Remember that?
8433581	8434262	True, true.
8434282	8434602	True enough.
8434622	8435422	I wonder if...
8459740	8460360	So, I don't know.
8460680	8465961	I kind of think the whole, like, touch, I think that's just, like, weird, crazy fanboy bullshit.
8466301	8466921	I truly do.
8475003	8476903	I bet you don't frickin' Nintendo things for us.
8476923	8479604	I was gonna have a button that says, give Nintendo money.
8479864	8482145	If there's anything in there, it's gonna put money regardless.
8482225	8482925	It's gonna sell.
8483145	8484285	I know for a fact it will.
8485915	8488957	They got the soccer mom market on Nintendo Wii.
8489297	8490458	Yeah, but will you buy one?
8490498	8491198	Do you own a Wii?
8493379	8494160	I owned a Wii.
8494460	8500443	I had it for three months and then I was like, wow, this is the most gimmicky piece of crap I've ever owned.
8500503	8502484	And I gave it to my cousin because I didn't want to sell it.
8502504	8503985	So I gave it to some kids.
8504045	8504605	I would use it.
8505126	8508187	Do you worry you might make the same mistake with a new Nintendo system?
8509868	8512429	I know I won't because I'm just going to switch to PC Master Race.
8512830	8513290	Ha ha ha.
8513832	8514693	Are you sure, though?
8514773	8518675	What could Nintendo announce on this thing that would make you be like, maybe I should get this?
8520116	8528740	Um... That they're actually gonna make a new GoldenEye that isn't stupid and handle like ass, and my ship just blew up.
8530001	8531902	Well, have fun in the PC Master Race.
8534463	8534844	Alright.
8535364	8538446	Alright, DeathWishing, we'll be looking for your reactions after E3.
8539846	8540567	Alright, well, um...
8542000	8547125	Have fun, whoever's gonna, like I was gonna pack seats or whatever, have fun with all the Japanese weeaboo's at Anime.
8547405	8547866	Oh, we will.
8548366	8548646	Alright.
8549347	8549647	Bye.
8549887	8550188	Bye.
8551749	8554752	There's gonna be some great, like, crossover interviews and things like that.
8554772	8558055	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8558696	8562519	I... I really think Anime Boston's gonna be forced to move weekends.
8562720	8562900	I know...
8564017	8569499	I know there's only so much convention center space and so on, but think outside the box, people.
8570579	8574220	Anyhow, 1-877-GAME-O-L-R or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
8574600	8576421	In the meantime, more last minute stories from Loki.
8577041	8579222	There's an NES cartridge that's being developed.
8579802	8582563	That will turn your NES into a MIDI synthesizer.
8582883	8584284	It's called Chip Maestro.
8584604	8587045	It was actually part of a Kickstarter program.
8587805	8590627	And for $50, you can grab one of these cartridges.
8590747	8597510	It plugs into a MIDI keyboard, and you can start creating your own 8-bit sounding music using a keyboard.
8597530	8598410	It's kind of cool.
8601280	8608285	Um, and then, of course, um, there is a new Xbox Live and PlayStation Network game that's been announced.
8608766	8611347	Um, Jeremy McGrath Off-Road.
8611367	8613809	Uh, no word on what the game is exactly.
8613989	8616731	Obviously, it's gonna be a Baja Racing type game.
8617151	8623396	It's actually being, um, developed, I guess, uh, from the people that did Baja Edge of Control for THQ.
8624576	8632543	and I guess they've also done some work on the MX vs. ATV series so they've got a good pedigree there but don't really know that many details about it.
8632683	8639288	People are kind of hoping that it's maybe a spiritual successor to Ivan Ironman Stewart's off-road racing game.
8639429	8640650	That game was fucking awesome.
8640670	8641510	Alright, let's go to the phones.
8641530	8643012	We've got another call coming in.
8644273	8645273	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8645293	8645674	Who's this?
8645774	8646554	You've already called the number.
8648136	8649797	Hey guys, it's CD Thunder.
8650197	8651899	CD Thunder, what's on your mind?
8655080	8657762	Well, I have a couple of things to talk to you about.
8658503	8659043	Go for it.
8661886	8663627	There must be like hella lag going on here.
8664187	8664608	Go ahead.
8666009	8667150	Well, let's see.
8667330	8671273	The two games I want to talk about, Perfect Dark and Gold 9007.
8672855	8674716	Some classic games.
8674856	8675377	Go for it.
8677478	8679280	Well, I like them both, and...
8680419	8686562	The Perfect Dark is basically like a space version of the GoldenEye 007, if you know what I'm talking about.
8688223	8689343	These are some old games.
8689363	8691684	These games have been out a very long time.
8692205	8699408	Are you just kind of getting around to playing classics, like rediscovering old stuff, kind of like our last callers playing some PC game from 2004?
8700148	8701789	Are you rediscovering classic games?
8702589	8710053	Are you finding these through the new versions of GoldenEye, Perfect Dark Zero, or what has piqued your interest in these games?
8711124	8714747	Oh, you're the guy that called in a few weeks ago and you just recently got a 64, right?
8729142	8733405	Actually, not recently, but a few Christmases ago or something.
8733685	8737828	Okay, but you don't have a lot of the new systems, right?
8738008	8738248	No.
8739729	8740710	Okay, I remember you.
8740770	8743912	All right, you've got all the classic stuff in your house.
8744692	8746974	Yeah, a lot of the good stuff.
8747174	8754919	You're gaming in a time capsule, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because there's a lot of shit out there right now, and so it really gives you time to focus on the classics.
8754979	8758922	So you're kind of rediscovering a lot of these games like they're totally new, right?
8759943	8760223	Yeah.
8760563	8761684	That's pretty cool, actually.
8763225	8768848	I'd like to be living in a bubble like that sometimes, because there's a lot of real crap out there right now.
8768868	8772991	All right, well, tell us, how was it playing Perfect Dark and Goldeneye for the first time?
8774172	8776593	Well, Goldeneye I actually had a lot of fun with.
8776613	8781977	I liked the James Bond, so since it was James Bond, I really liked it a lot.
8783017	8784738	Well, a lot of the levels are really difficult.
8785539	8785759	Mm-hmm.
8787703	8793588	and with Perfect Dark it's basically... Go ahead.
8794669	8794789	Oh.
8796030	8810343	And the Perfect Dark is basically like a space age version of Goldmine 007 except you play as a woman and you have on-screen reloads but in Goldmine 007 you have off-screen reloads.
8810383	8811424	And the bitch can't jump.
8813243	8816065	Yeah, she can jump only a little bit.
8816625	8818006	You know, they made a new GoldenEye.
8818046	8818606	In fact, it's funny.
8818626	8820247	I think one of the previous callers brought this up.
8820288	8824570	They made a new GoldenEye last year on the Wii, so you'll be playing that in about 2018.
8825431	8828993	But they made this game, and a lot of people aren't really fans of it.
8829053	8831074	Like, they say it blows.
8831194	8833236	It isn't like the original at all.
8833656	8836538	Why do you think people are so partial to the original GoldenEye?
8836578	8838159	What is the charm in the original GoldenEye?
8840748	8858966	Well, because it could be maybe because they like the movie, and because of that they like the game, and since they remade the Goldeneye 007 on the Wii with Daniel Craig, they're thinking it's a reboot of the original, so maybe that's one of the reasons.
8860626	8860946	All right.
8861507	8864831	Well, buddy, we're going to let you go to take some more calls, but I'm just going to leave you with this.
8865051	8866492	Don't bother with Majora's Mask.
8866532	8868414	It's not nearly as good as Ocarina of Time.
8868495	8868955	Just so you know.
8869696	8869976	All right.
8870136	8870357	All right.
8870397	8870877	Take care, buddy.
8871498	8871798	Thanks.
8871898	8873320	You too.
8873340	8877144	1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8879911	8882473	You know, I really do mean it.
8882513	8885735	Sometimes I kind of wish I could just kind of go back in gaming.
8885795	8887236	Like, seriously, Super Nintendo?
8888157	8889418	There's so many good games on that.
8889458	8890799	I probably still have yet to play.
8891519	8891839	All right.
8893380	8895942	And some folks in chat room vehemently disagree with me.
8896002	8898884	DarkToagak in chat says, Majora's Mask is orgasmic.
8899124	8900565	What the hell is Sky talking about?
8900725	8901866	Majora's Mask was annoying.
8902326	8902887	I didn't like it.
8903567	8906869	Of course, I always thought that Ocarina of Time was a little bit overrated, too.
8907229	8909371	I liked Ocarina, but my favorites still link to the past.
8910069	8912771	Alright, let's wrap up with last minute stories, Loki, if you had anything else.
8913192	8914453	His last minute story is Portal.
8915293	8915994	I had nothing else.
8916314	8917375	Oh, okay.
8918136	8933108	And I'm getting a private message about Square Enix might be going bankrupt, and I do remember reading the article online, I don't have it up in front of me, but I think they reported huge losses recently, and I assumed a lot, well, I
8933628	8937410	I think part of it, they were trying to say, might have been the tsunami, which makes sense.
8937790	8939151	Obviously, everybody heard from that.
8939571	8949956	But I think a really large part of it that I don't think was really announced in the report was the utter, dismal, cataclysmic failure of Final Fantasy XIV.
8950597	8955479	Because keep in mind, that game was supposed to come out on PlayStation 3 by now, but it hasn't.
8956319	8958220	So yeah, I think Square is probably way...
8959921	8961982	and overestimated what they were going to make last quarter.
8962002	8965425	And I think a lot of that has to do with Final Fantasy XIV, honestly.
8966245	8967566	Oh, I'm getting more information.
8967726	8969808	Thank you to the person who's messaging me right now.
8969868	8974391	Let me pull up this link in our little browser box here.
8975131	8976492	Oh, and of course it's all in Japanese.
8976552	8977273	I can't read that.
8979414	8981375	That's why you should use Nifty.
8981936	8983417	Oh, yeah, I could use Nifty.
8983477	8984498	Hold on.
8984518	8985758	Or I could use Google Translate.
8987380	8987900	Do-do-do-do-do.
8988618	8998773	Final Fantasy XIII apparently plays into this as well, Final Fantasy XIII not quite selling as much as they thought I'm translating it now
9002808	9026760	16 billion yen extraordinary loss and damage the earthquake did stop them to some development they are attributing this to Final Fantasy XIV and postponing that let's see, they're thinking though they say the business environment is rapidly changing yeah, they do cite Final Fantasy XIV multiple times here
9028901	9040429	Final Fantasy XI I guess it talks about that Final Fantasy XIV wasn't the same quality as Final Fantasy XI and they actually apologized for the unusual situation it has become.
9041090	9041450	Yikes.
9042151	9047174	Well, we told you when we first reported on Final Fantasy XIV heads were going to roll.
9048975	9051858	Final Fantasy XIII too it sounds like might be delayed too.
9052678	9053679	Good times!
9053699	9053759	Yes!
9055580	9057480	Alright, that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.
9057620	9058361	I think we're all done.
9058861	9061621	So, this is the part where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9061881	9064662	But first, I'm going to thank all you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
9064962	9070723	And remember, if you like what you heard, you know, we got into this during the email bag, but we don't have big corporate dollars behind the show.
9071063	9075804	We do this just because we like having a show, hanging out with each other, and hanging out with you guys every Sunday.
9076124	9077724	So, tell some friends to come join the party.

9088189	9089670	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9089710	9091272	I'll start with the portal-loving Loki.
9092373	9094394	Your final thought tonight.
9094414	9097297	My final thought is we never did FU's of the Week.
9097797	9098218	No, we didn't.
9098538	9099159	Oh, we didn't.
9100179	9101841	Shit, I guess we should do that now then, shouldn't we?
9101861	9102181	I don't care.
9102521	9102982	You don't care?
9103562	9104123	No, we can do it.
9104563	9105184	Alright, here they go.
9120482	9123344	F you to this little patch of eczema on my right hand ring finger.
9123704	9123984	The end.
9125665	9125905	Loki?
9126305	9129427	F you to the woman that wasn't watching where she was driving and hit the back of my car.
9129967	9131828	Don't!
9132469	9133369	F you to hangovers.
9134390	9135490	I had a bad one this morning.
9136311	9137091	Alright, there you go, Loki.
9137131	9137892	We did the F yous of the week.
9139132	9146796	My F you of the week, or not my F you, my final thought is weekend's already over and that makes me sad.
9149178	9149558	DarkSakura?
9150495	9152459	He who controls the spice controls the universe.
9154743	9155925	Alright, that does it everybody.
9156005	9157909	Thank you again for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9157969	9159592	Let's say we do it all again next week.
9159913	9160414	Sound good?
