0	20520	Tonight, May 22nd, 2011, some PSP games are rumored to be remade for the PlayStation 3
20520	23000	and anticipated 3DS title is delayed.
23000	31400	And will Nintendo's new home console be equipped with a camera?
31400	34400	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
34400	35400	Lounge Radio.
35400	40560	It's the show where every gamer has a voice and this is episode number 414 for May the
40560	42520	22nd of 2011.
42520	43520	My name is Rob Roberts.
43520	46280	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts.
46280	48800	First off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48800	49800	Yo.
49800	50800	How are you doing?
50800	51800	Yo.
51800	52800	Yo.
52800	53800	No.
53800	55640	I heard you got drunk last night.
55640	58340	I didn't get as drunk as I did at the last party.
58340	63040	You got drunk and played rock band and sang Lady Gaga and yet there's no video of this.
63040	71500	I've got video though of the guys at the party doing a Snoop Dogg song.
71500	73160	It's really a dark video but I have it.
73160	74160	It's on my phone.
74160	75160	Alright.
75160	80800	But I also tried to sing Bon Jovi and it's sad when men have a higher range than I do.
80800	82600	Hi spouse.
82600	83960	Is Dan coming to say hi on the show?
83960	84960	No.
84960	85960	I guess not.
85960	86960	Alright.
86960	89000	Well, I have to introduce the other host that's here that's not Dan.
89000	91240	Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
91240	92240	Yes.
92240	93240	I'm definitely not Dan.
93240	94240	How are you, Loki?
94240	95640	I'm fine.
95640	97800	That's good, Loki.
97800	98800	What's new with you?
98800	99800	Not much.
99800	102880	Just sitting at home.
102880	103880	You're boring.
103880	106920	Well, you know, I started some projects.
106920	109160	Well, more projects on projects.
109160	115280	No, I started my three foot tall papercraft statue of the portal turret.
115280	116280	That's right.
116280	117280	Ooh.
117280	119200	I keep forgetting you're building your own portal turret.
119200	120880	That kind of cracks me up.
120880	122440	I don't know why.
122440	123440	I want one.
123440	129640	Well, as soon as I get the design correct, because right now unfortunately the 3D model
129640	136360	I ported over using Pepakura had a lot of internal stuff because it was actually a full
136360	138840	3D model with the actual guns and stuff.
138840	142480	This turret's not going to have the doors open with the guns showing.
142480	148900	But it still tried to create papercraft pieces for all that stuff that you're never going
148900	149900	to see.
149900	152540	So I had to filter out the stuff that I didn't need.
152540	155920	You know, I've actually done a turret model that doesn't have the doors or anything, right?
155920	161320	Yeah, but I've already printed it all out and I don't know.
161320	163160	If I run into problems, then yeah.
163160	168360	Let me introduce the always present fourth guest on our show at the chat room at chat.orangelountraining.com
168360	172280	because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at
172280	176520	All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
176520	180160	So we invite you to join us for a live show sometime or all the time.
180160	182160	Like a lot of our chatties, we see a lot of familiar faces.
182160	185560	One of those familiar faces starts us off tonight with this chat comment.
185560	188560	Tigerclaw says, what's up Sky Dark Soccer Loki?
188560	190400	I got to ask you guys this.
190400	196680	What did the three of you do on the day of the rapture, Sind?
196680	205600	I played some World of Warcraft and slept in and then I went to a very gay Jewish party.
205600	207760	First off, can I say fuck that rapture guy?
207760	212480	Like fuck him in the ear and fuck CNN and fuck MSNBC and all these websites that give
212480	215680	him attention and like make people want to tweet about it and all that stuff.
215680	216680	And look, I'm no better.
216680	221040	I made my fair share of rapture jokes, but I'm not talking about like snarky Facebook
221040	223040	posts because that's what websites like that are for.
223040	227320	But like, you know, there's real news going on in the world that's just, yes, I realize
227320	230920	this is a video game podcast, but I'm on my soapbox and made a funny picture.
230920	234760	It just, it just downs me that some asshole can come out and say, no, really guys, it's
234760	236080	going to end May 21st.
236080	237080	So sell your shit.
237080	241420	I'm totally surreal for real, for real, real here.
241420	246160	So I'm going to just say the world's going to end on Christmas.
246160	247760	It's going to be really fucking ironic.
247760	249400	We're going to all die on Christmas.
249400	251160	So there you go.
251160	255840	And now listen to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to hear more of the Gospel.
255840	260440	Isn't it like allegedly supposed to end in like December 2012 because of the Mayan calendar
260440	261440	seems garbage?
261440	262440	It's always supposed to fucking end.
262440	263440	The same guy says it's going to end in the 90s.
263440	267920	Okay, on top of that too, okay, and this is me getting into a little bit of technical
267920	268920	history.
268920	272000	If I am right, the Mayans used a lunar calendar, meaning that their months are on a different
272000	275920	basis than it would be on the Gregorian calendar, because right now it's like halfway through
275920	276920	the Jewish year.
276920	281140	Yeah, but I'm sure no one would jump to conclusions and saying that the world's going to end
281140	282140	on a specific date.
282140	285600	They obviously have some scientific fact to back that up.
285600	288280	I mean, what are we, savages?
288280	294280	I mean, no one just goes out spouting random garbage like the world's going to end yesterday
294280	298200	and it doesn't happen without any sort of proof.
298200	302280	This is just the irony to me is that they can't find the dude, Camping was named Harold
302280	310480	Camping, and that the family radio, the site that he's like the president of, is down.
310480	315120	So I posted in the chatroom the picture that I made about the URL being raptured.
315120	318520	Well, he was a false prophet and he's going to burn in hell for all eternity.
318520	319520	Yay!
319520	321000	Can we talk about video games now?
321000	322000	Hell's his concept.
322000	323000	He can go there.
323000	324000	All right.
324000	325000	Let's go to how was your gaming week?
325000	326960	Uh, DarkSakura, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?
326960	329800	I caught World of Warcraft, addict.
329800	330800	Dealer.
330800	336760	You're my crack dealer now, which, by the way, I need you to look at my setup later.
336760	337760	I will.
337760	340240	Yeah, I played some World of Warcraft.
340240	346480	I put Rebecca Black on hold and I am now playing Blodwin, who is a shammy, who I'm kicking
346480	347480	butt with.
347480	349480	I was on Hoard House, which was fun.
349480	350480	You were.
350480	351480	Yeah.
351480	352480	We had a good time.
352480	355480	Except when, when you and Extrofer were going off about something, so I got up and got some
355480	356480	water.
356480	357480	I didn't even know you left.
357480	358480	Because I'm that good.
358480	360680	Was the show getting too nerdy for you?
360680	361680	No, no.
361680	363520	I was actually super thirsty the entire time.
363520	365920	Hoardhouse.com, plug, plug, plug.
365920	368720	One of these days I'm going to actually read a comic book and then be all like, I should
368720	369720	be on Comic Insanity.
369720	377120	I did that on Comic Insanity this morning, too, because Shadow was talking about Final
377120	380120	Fantasy IX and he and Tiara were like, oh, Final Fantasy IX, blah, blah, blah.
380120	381120	I'm like, I didn't play it.
381120	383280	I got up and got some coffee.
383280	384280	Nice.
384280	388520	Yeah, now everybody knows how professional I am.
388520	392680	But I also played, I started back on going back through some of the chapters on Portal
392680	394720	2 to try to get achievements.
394720	401520	So I already got the door prize, which is super easy.
401520	405240	But there's also, you can get the two achievements at one time.
405240	410060	The door prize, when you first find like the first area that's got these doors, three doors
410060	413380	up in the top, you go up there and you listen to each door and he talks about your blood
413380	418120	turning into gasoline and having to pee and something else.
418120	423000	And then when, right before you get GLaDOS again, I don't care if I'm spoiling, when
423000	428320	you're in the top office, you go in behind a file cabinet is a door that leads you to
428320	431480	three more vitrified doors and then where the Borealis dock is.
431480	436440	So you'll get the door prize thing for listening to Cave Johnson rant like a madman and then
436440	438900	finding the remnants of the Borealis.
438900	441280	So I did that.
441280	446680	The next one I'm doing a Smash TV where you have to break all the like 11 monitors that
446680	448240	Wheatley's jabbering at you at.
448240	451880	Yeah, some of those are pretty hard.
451880	454000	The key to doing the Wheatley ones is lasers.
454000	458300	Yeah, I know that, but I'm just saying some of the ones that had no lasers.
458300	461100	And I've got to go back and get the Turret Symphony.
461100	462400	The Turrets practicing singing.
462400	465000	Oh yes, I have that one.
465000	468260	And I also need to get secret transmission, which actually there's two secret transmissions
468260	471560	in Portal 2 I found out.
471560	478360	When you're on the, and everybody listen up, when you're doing the aerial faith plate test,
478360	483840	it's a big one with all the room full of faith plates, and GLaDOS shoots garbage at you.
483840	484840	You take...
484840	487680	Okay, I'm trying to explain exactly where the things are.
487680	491080	You take the radio, you can actually get two achievements here.
491080	495920	One of them is putting your portal on top of the place over the giant button, and then
495920	496920	the...
496920	497920	Three achievements actually.
497920	499540	Oh, let me do the two I know.
499540	503000	And then you put your portal on the ramp so that when the thing goes in the ramp it falls
503000	507200	down and falls right on the button and you get the achievement for not touching a thing
507200	512480	and having it land on the button, but you also go back and when you launch into the
512480	516240	one that's on the ramp but your other portal is going to be on this thing across from the
516240	519920	part jutting out, and it busts you through a window and you find another rat man den
519920	526160	and if you've got the radio with you it will play a modem sound, and what that is it actually
526160	528840	translates into an image if you've got a decoder.
528840	529840	Wow.
529840	535040	Because, you know, they had the whole ARG thing going on, the alternate reality game,
535040	542160	it was basically connecting to a BBS with an old 33k modem or something, and all these
542160	544640	images and stuff would go through.
544640	546880	I miss BBSs.
546880	551640	I want a BBS for Orange Lounge Radio where I can play Trade Wars 2002 all over again.
551640	555000	The other one is when you're in the lower labs and you're playing in commentary mode
555000	561200	you'll find a developer commentary that's nothing but modem noise, and it's a picture
561200	562200	too.
562200	563200	Hey nerds.
563200	564600	Actually it's not a picture.
564600	568560	It's them talking about part of the development of Portal 2.
568560	569560	Wait, this is important.
569560	574160	Nerds in chat, I need to know, can you still download like Telguard and stuff and set it
574160	576600	up to run off of like Telnet or whatever?
576600	577600	Probably.
577600	578600	Is that possible?
578600	579600	Because we need to make that happen.
579600	580600	Probably.
580600	585400	Oh come on, there's so many retro gamers out there that I bet there's still a gemstone
585400	586400	server running somewhere.
586400	587840	Ooh, I haven't played that in forever.
587840	591960	The third achievement is by picking up the broken turret that gets launched in there
591960	592960	and you launch it.
592960	593960	Oh yeah, turret dactyl.
593960	597600	Yeah, if you launch a turret with an aerial faith plate you get an achievement for it.
597600	598600	Oh, that I've done.
598600	599600	I know I did that.
599600	600600	I think that was a different statement.
600600	601600	I didn't do that one either.
601600	602600	I need to do more co-op.
602600	603600	I haven't played enough.
603600	606240	I'll play co-op with you, but I'll probably end up throwing up all over Sharmi.
606240	608720	I don't know, he's a cat.
608720	612000	I watch the human vault section, so.
612000	616040	Blackwolf in the chat room says yes, and there are lots of Telnet BBSs out there.
616040	618440	OMG, I want an OLR1.
618440	619440	Like really bad.
619440	620440	Let's do it.
620440	621440	Like come on you guys.
621440	622440	Somebody in the chat room, do it.
622440	623440	No, I'll do it.
623440	624440	Rob will do it, okay.
624440	625440	I'll do it, because I want to be the sis-op.
625440	626440	Okay.
626440	632400	I always wanted my own BBS when I was a kid, but my mom wouldn't let me get a second phone
632400	633400	line.
633400	635400	So let's set up the OLR BBS.
635400	636400	Yeah, I want an OLR BBS.
636400	637400	Okay.
637400	638400	Let me make that happen.
638400	639400	Alright, anyhow.
639400	640400	Anything else?
640400	642440	We have like two different conversations going on here.
642440	646640	One of them very modern with Portal 2, and the other one not so modern with BBSs and
646640	652080	Telnet and The Pit and Trade Wars, Legend of the Red Dragon.
652080	656600	I actually did try to play some of the DAC, but my computer farted on me while I was trying
656600	659320	to play the Star Trek.
659320	661480	And I tried playing Darwinia.
661480	666320	That game's confusing, and it gives me a bit of a headache.
666320	670280	So I'm going to have to probably take a whole bunch of mydol and try playing it again.
670280	673680	Because no, it really does give me a headache.
673680	678380	The modeling in it, and the colors, makes my head hurt.
678380	681280	So sadness.
681280	682280	Getting old sucks.
682280	686920	No, it's definitely, that's always done it to me.
686920	690200	And then I played By Shermy Cat Food the game.
690200	691200	The end.
691200	693880	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
693880	697080	I wish I could say that I played exciting stuff, but I haven't.
697080	701280	I just played Grand Theft Auto, and a brief bit of Portal, because I was trying to test
701280	705520	something on my graphics card, because for some reason in Grand Theft Auto on my PC,
705520	707520	it decided, hey, you know what, I'm going to run really slow now.
707520	709020	And I was like, what?
709020	713960	Why are you running slow when you're running perfectly fine, just all the other days?
713960	719960	And it ended up that I was trying to overclock my laptop's graphics card, and I think the
719960	723560	program ran in the background.
723560	727400	Slowed things down, actually, because I did a cooling mod on this thing, so I actually
727400	732000	have the fans kicked up, and there's a big old intake vent in the back now.
732000	736280	And I normally have a cooling pad that go on the bottom of this, but I don't have it
736280	737280	with me right now.
737280	738860	But it's running much cooler.
738860	744000	And so now I can actually overclock the GPU when I get a chance.
744000	748440	I haven't really bothered to make it stable yet.
748440	749440	So yeah.
749440	754440	But I will be playing later on tonight, once I get done moving some stuff around.
754440	759680	I have a leaked copy of the Duke Nukem Forever demo that I will be checking out, because
759680	765040	Duke Nukem Forever is awesome, and the fact that I can play a part of it, it's like it's
765040	766040	not even...
766040	767480	I didn't realize it already had, like, leaked.
767480	770680	Oh yeah, they have an internal demo that's really, really buggy.
770680	771680	Hmm.
771680	775080	Because the real one's out, what, June 3rd or something like that?
775080	776080	Yes.
776080	777080	Awesome.
777080	779760	Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which
779760	785320	is also, a lot of the same old stuff, you know, it's kind of a slow period for me right
785320	787020	now with games.
787020	789400	More Warcraft, of course, as always.
789400	792000	Another game I don't want to talk about tonight, but I'm going to talk about it on Hoard House
792000	795240	this week, and it'll make sense when we get to Thursday.
795240	798520	And then I want to mention a couple other games I've been playing.
798520	802800	The new one, well not new, this game's like two years old and I'm just now getting around
802800	810240	to it, is the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame Collection I played this week on Xbox 360.
810240	815880	I actually had this game on the Wii a few years ago, and there was like a year difference
815880	817040	between the releases.
817040	820120	One of them came out in 08, I think, and the other one came out in 09.
820120	824680	And I played the newer one, the 360 one, which was also released on PS3.
824680	829360	And it's old pinball games, and they're classic tables, redone for the 360.
829360	833000	So if you like, you know, pinball FX and these types of games, this is right up your alley.
833000	838080	And these are pinball tables most of us remember from, you know, 20 years ago, if, you know,
838080	840960	you were around 20 years ago and going to arcades.
840960	845440	So for example, Tales of Arabian Nights is in this game, I love that table.
845440	847880	Whirlwind, the one that had the little fan at the top.
847880	849200	We had one in my garage.
849200	850520	The old school Black Knight.
850520	854160	Pimbot, everybody knows Pimbot, because they had an NES game of Pimbot, so you can play
854160	855160	the authentic table.
855160	857680	Pimbot's actually kind of a crappy table, like it's a cheap ass table.
857680	859000	Bride of Pimbot is great.
859000	862000	I like Bride of Pimbot, but that sadly is not in this compilation.
862000	863600	Neither is Theater of Magic.
863600	866560	Actually Jackbot is the best of the bot ones.
866560	869040	And that's, no, not in the collection either.
869040	875080	But there's some other interesting tables, I think about 12 tables in all.
875080	879200	Certainly the, I sound quiet, I shouldn't sound quiet.
879200	882800	No, everybody in chat says I sound fine.
882800	885560	Of course, live radio, the joys of that.
885560	888400	Anyhow, I'll turn myself up just a wee bit.
888400	889400	There you go.
889400	894240	Alright, so other things about the compilation, it's kind of weird because some of the games
894240	899520	are free, and then some of them will cost you credits, which is odd to me, that you
899520	903040	just don't get everything for free at the start, but I guess it wants to give you something
903040	904040	to work towards.
904040	909340	But as far as the important stuff, the translation itself, you know, it works.
909340	910340	It's nice.
910340	914920	A little bit pricey probably, you know, considering it's, I think it was what, about 40 bucks
914920	919960	when it came out, you know, just for 12 tables and you got Pinball FX that offers, you know,
919960	922440	some pretty competitive tables at a good price.
922440	925440	But now that the game's kind of old, you can probably find it really cheap.
925440	929680	And if you are a Pinball fan, you should probably pick it up because it's a good compilation
929680	930680	of games.
930680	933200	Otherwise, continuing to play some of the games I talked about last week like Might
933200	940720	Magic, Order of Chaos or whatever it's called, the puzzle game on 360, and some other stuff
940720	945360	like Mortal Kombat, which I've had very mixed success playing it online.
945360	947640	Sometimes it's very laggy.
947640	951900	Sometimes it's pretty smooth, but every time I lose horrifically because I'm really bad
951900	954960	at Mortal Kombat, and that makes me sad.
954960	957440	So that does it for my gaming week.
957440	961680	So let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
961680	965760	Join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, or of course our Facebook, facebook.com
965760	967980	slash orange lounge radio.
967980	969280	Something else is important to note.
969280	973320	Next week is Memorial Day weekend, and we know there's several anime conventions going
973320	976520	on and other things of that sort, other types of conventions.
976520	977880	We're not going to be here with the show next week.
977880	980840	We're actually going to take the week off because of Memorial Day, and I'm actually
980840	982920	going to be out of town on top of that.
982920	985580	So sadly, we will not be here next week, Memorial Day.
985580	986840	I'm hating you right now, Rob.
986840	987840	I'm sorry.
987840	988840	I'm being hateful in judgment.
988840	990680	I will make it up to you in three weeks.
990680	991680	I know.
991680	994440	In three weeks is going to be more awesomer.
994440	995440	So I'm going...
995440	997800	I need to find 50 bucks to get a Duffy.
997800	1001520	I'm going to be going to the happiest place on earth twice within a month span, but that's
1001520	1002520	just the way it works.
1002520	1003520	Hateful, jealous, judgmental.
1003520	1006140	Well, deal with it.
1006140	1007680	That's the sound of my falling sunglasses.
1007680	1008680	Deal with it.
1008680	1009680	All right.
1009680	1010680	Rob, hearts.
1010680	1011680	What?
1011680	1012680	Hearts.
1012680	1019780	So yeah, no show next week, but we are looking at doing some special shows the week of E3,
1019780	1022080	and I'm not sure how that's going to work yet.
1022080	1026120	I know that's weird because we're not actually going to E3, but we have a pal of ours who
1026120	1029280	does a show before us here at All Games Radio who's going to E3.
1029280	1033680	So we're hoping we can kind of get some reports from him and interject that with our own sassy
1033680	1038000	commentary and the rest of your voices on the internet through Twitter and so forth.
1038000	1039760	So we're looking at doing some type of E3 specials.
1039760	1044220	We're not sure exactly what time yet, but that will happen the week of E3.
1044220	1047800	I've already been limbering my eyes up.
1047800	1052760	So I can roll them like nothing else when I see the Nintendo press conference.
1052760	1053760	He's going to roll it like a katamari.
1053760	1056360	I'm going to be like, oh god, seriously?
1056360	1058880	This is your great idea?
1058880	1061560	I have low expectations for Nintendo.
1061560	1063400	Let's see if they can limbo under that.
1063400	1064400	All right.
1064400	1065480	Well, we'll see.
1065480	1070760	And I'm really hoping we can get Loki to come to the show whenever Nintendo's press conference.
1070760	1073400	Ideally, well, you'll have to work whenever.
1073400	1074400	When is the Nintendo press conference?
1074400	1075400	It's during the day.
1075400	1076400	So you'll have to be at work.
1076400	1079880	I really don't work when those are going on because I'll, I'll stop what I'm doing and
1079880	1080880	watch it.
1080880	1084480	Cause I want to get your immediate reaction to those press conferences.
1084480	1089240	Oh, I'll be on Twitter, but what the fuck is that?
1089240	1090240	Really?
1090240	1091240	That's a great idea.
1091240	1092960	Oh, awesome.
1092960	1097140	We need to do some type of like where we are commenting on the press conferences as they're
1097140	1099440	going on and then you can like download it later on.
1099440	1101000	It's like a riff tracks type of thing.
1101000	1102000	I don't know.
1102000	1103000	We'll see.
1103000	1104000	No, not really.
1104000	1109240	Well, it's technically possible because they do syndicate that stuff later on so that you
1109240	1111980	can re-watch the actual videos and stuff.
1111980	1113920	So we could do that.
1113920	1115320	Nah, too much effort.
1115320	1116320	All right.
1116320	1117320	Yeah, exactly.
1117320	1118320	I would say that.
1118320	1119320	All right.
1119320	1121740	So we will not be here next week on Memorial Day weekend, sadly.
1121740	1126280	We will be back the week after though, which happens to be the Sunday before E3.
1126280	1128440	And that's when the news is really going to start to roll in.
1128440	1131440	In fact, I think we're going to get to a story on this later.
1131440	1134640	One of the developers is doing their press conference Sunday night.
1134640	1136640	They're kind of getting a jump on everybody else.
1136640	1138680	So it's going to be very interesting.
1138680	1140640	So the news will start flooding in in two weeks.
1140640	1146000	I might actually do a little bit of a commentary on my Tumblr as well.
1146000	1147000	All across the internets.
1147000	1148000	Yeah, why not?
1148000	1149000	All right.
1149000	1153440	They're looking to have 1,000,000 viewers.
1153440	1154440	Let's move on.
1154440	1156760	Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.
1156760	1161280	There's still a lot going on in the gaming world, ramping up to E3 this week.
1161280	1163720	So let's go to Loki, who's going to start us off tonight.
1163720	1164720	Yes.
1164720	1169560	Sony announced their titles that are going to be a part of the Welcome Back program.
1169560	1176040	Of course, the Welcome Back program includes a free 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus for
1176040	1177960	all PlayStation Network users.
1177960	1185760	Also they're going to be giving out a 30-day trial to Curiosity, I guess.
1185760	1186760	Or Curiosity.
1186760	1187760	Whatever.
1187760	1190320	I'm calling it Curiosity.
1190320	1200880	And then also, apparently, two free PlayStation games and two free PlayStation Portable games.
1200880	1206520	Of the free PlayStation 3 games that are available for North America, because it's a little bit
1206520	1213520	different in each region, Dead Nation, Infamous, LittleBigPlanet, SuperStardust HD, and Wipeout
1213520	1214960	HD Plus Fury...
1214960	1219240	Well, I already own two of those, so that's going to narrow down my choices of what I'm
1219240	1220240	going to get.
1220240	1221240	Exactly.
1221240	1222240	Same here.
1222240	1228080	For PSP owners, I guess, you'll be able to get LittleBigPlanet on PSP, Modination Racers,
1228080	1231520	Pursuit Force, or Killzone Liberation.
1231520	1235640	And then, of course, they're going to have a selection of On Us movie rentals through
1235640	1239840	the PlayStation Network, and I guess existing PlayStation Plus subscribers will receive
1239840	1246920	an additional 60 days of free subscription, and existing Music Unlimited Premium trial
1246920	1252920	subscription members will receive an additional 30 days of free music as well, and also an
1252920	1258040	additional 30 days plus time lost for existing members of the Music Unlimited Premium basic
1258040	1262920	subscription fee, free of charge.
1262920	1269600	And Home, of course, they're going to have 100 free items in Home.
1269600	1273160	Can one of those items be useful clubhouses?
1273160	1274560	No.
1274560	1276400	Damn.
1276400	1280560	In Europe, they're going to be doing some slightly different titles.
1280560	1287760	They're going to have Ratchet & Clank, Quest for Booty, Wipeout HD, Fury, Dead Nation,
1287760	1289400	Infamous, and LittleBigPlanet.
1289400	1293760	And then, of course, on PSP, actually the titles are the same on PSP.
1293760	1298840	But I guess it's going to be slightly different for each region, which begs the question,
1298840	1304680	since PlayStation Network accounts are free to create, I had three of them, so I guess
1304680	1309720	I get six games, because I had three accounts.
1309720	1314200	Is there going to be a thing where maybe you have to have used a credit card in a transaction
1314200	1315200	or something?
1315200	1316200	I don't think so.
1316200	1317200	Interesting.
1317200	1321000	Because technically, I mean, I could download some free download content or something like
1321000	1325600	that and never had to buy anything, but I'm still out of, you know, the three, four weeks
1325600	1327120	or whatever it was down.
1327120	1330960	What if I share a PlayStation with somebody else, like, you know, my significant other
1330960	1334320	lives with me and we share an account, or I mean, I'm sorry, we don't share an account,
1334320	1337560	we share a PlayStation, but we have two separate accounts, so will I get to get two and he'll
1337560	1338560	get to get the other two?
1338560	1339560	That's what I'm thinking.
1339560	1340560	Nice!
1340560	1341560	Yes, that's what I'm thinking.
1341560	1348240	I mean, I could be wrong, either way, let me put it this way, I mean, I have LittleBigPlanet
1348240	1353400	already and I would never, I wouldn't want to download it, because I have my, you know,
1353400	1359020	really rare LittleBigPlanet with the band music in there, you know, I'd probably pick
1359020	1363600	up Infamous because that looked pretty good, but the rest of the PlayStation Network games,
1363600	1370480	I just don't really care too much about those, maybe, I don't know, Dead Nation looked alright
1370480	1376800	or Wipeout, I really don't care, but, you know, if I can pick six titles, then I'll
1376800	1381120	probably get everything and then we'll see what Japan has whenever they get around to
1381120	1383160	come back up.
1383160	1389800	Let's see, some other fun stuff, Sony-related, the PlayStation Network, they had opened up
1389800	1396840	their website for changing your password, and apparently, the sign-ins, they've disabled
1396840	1405160	them because they found a potential exploit that people could use to, you know, basically
1405160	1406520	hack your account.
1406520	1407520	Awesome.
1407520	1410680	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
1410680	1413760	Okay, now keep reading.
1413760	1417520	And this is great, it says, Sony has issued a statement on the PlayStation Blog describing
1417520	1424280	the issue as a URL exploit we have subsequently fixed, it says consumers who have resetted
1424280	1428560	their passwords for PlayStation Network are still encouraged to do so directly on their
1428560	1432860	PS3, otherwise they can continue to do so via the website as soon as we bring that back
1432860	1433860	up.
1433860	1442400	But apparently, yeah, I guess it allowed people to go some roundabout way to change their
1442400	1448440	password and get access to their account.
1448440	1454800	It's very minor and it got, you know, fixed pretty quick, but it's just, you can't keep
1454800	1458200	making these mistakes, you really gotta be on your toes, you know.
1458200	1464240	Oh wait, I love this comment in our chat room from Islander, by the way, O-L-R, a lot of
1464240	1468920	people on home right now, actually it's like i3linder, but I'm just saying.
1468920	1469920	Blender?
1469920	1472880	Oh, it's, oh, it's a little bee, okay, Blender.
1472880	1476920	Blender says, by the way, O-L-R, a lot of people on home right now are having freezing
1476920	1478760	issues when they get a new item.
1478760	1481720	Some sort of bug since the relaunch.
1481720	1485800	So home is freezing whenever you get a new item.
1485800	1490080	I guess home is hell.
1490080	1492520	Awesome.
1492520	1495080	And then this is great, and it keeps on going from here.
1495080	1503080	Now this isn't necessarily PlayStation related, but apparently Sony had another website hacked
1503080	1507080	and people have started stealing virtual currency.
1507080	1514400	It's, I guess, some Sony-run internet service provider called Sonet.
1514400	1519880	They had some virtual points or whatever and people apparently stole roughly a hundred
1519880	1525880	thousand yen or, you know, twelve hundred dollars worth of virtual points.
1525880	1532280	And it says no personal information was compromised or any other accounts, but, you know, it's
1532280	1534880	still kind of pathetic that you're having multiple accounts assigned.
1534880	1538640	In fact, there's another story that I don't even think was on here where they had another
1538640	1544800	account, another website that got hacked and became a phishing account now, phishing websites.
1544800	1551120	So man, Sony is just the Internet's bitch right now.
1551120	1552200	I don't know.
1552200	1553200	It's kind of sad.
1553200	1558080	Well, somebody is seriously kicking them while they're down, which is pretty much sad.
1558080	1559800	I feel bad for them in a way.
1559800	1563680	And on top of all that, you know, because, you know, the one site that was turned into
1563680	1569960	kind of a phishing site was actually, I believe, a Japanese website for Sony.
1569960	1576520	Well, the Japanese government refuses to let Sony relaunch the PlayStation Network there.
1576520	1578520	They haven't given approval for it.
1578520	1587000	And it says apparently the Ministry of Economy, Content, Industry says the government refused
1587000	1592960	Sony's initiative to launch the platform again.
1592960	1598600	As of May 13th, Sony was incomplete in exercising measures that they said they will do on the
1598600	1603520	May 1st press conference, says the details of which the measures haven't been enacted
1603520	1605560	yet were not released.
1605560	1610040	The source added that the government wants clear terms of what Sony is planning on doing
1610040	1614320	to protect its users credit card info, saying there were similar cases in the past that
1614320	1619080	were caused by other firms and we're asking Sony whether their measures are good enough
1619080	1623840	to good enough when compared to countermeasures taken in the past.
1623840	1625600	I mean, that sounds fair enough.
1625600	1631800	It's kind of a big deal, like, that the country's basically saying, uh, no, you're not coming
1631800	1634160	back up because you're not proven that you're secure.
1634160	1637640	And then as we keep hearing all these stories about other facets of the company getting
1637640	1639880	hacked, it's kind of not helping their case.
1639880	1641880	No, it's not.
1641880	1646160	Well, you know why the Roman Empire fell?
1646160	1649280	The Roman Empire.
1649280	1652600	Sony sort of said it the same way?
1652600	1654400	I've been saying this for weeks now.
1654400	1661800	There needs to be a major, major shakeup within the senior management at Sony and otherwise
1661800	1664600	there's not going to be a PlayStation 4.
1664600	1669600	I mean, I don't, or there might be one, but it's going to be overlooked.
1669600	1674280	Anyhow, uh, let's move on to some more hopeful news.
1674280	1677760	Um, you know, not all the news that comes out of Sony these days is bad and this could
1677760	1680720	be possibly giving us a sinus and things that we could look forward to at E3.
1680720	1686760	And I got to say, man, Sony, Sony is going to have, I mean, I realized Nintendo has just
1686760	1691280	announced that they're showing a new fucking console at E3, but I am still most interested
1691280	1692640	in Sony's press conference.
1692640	1693640	I really am.
1693640	1699160	Like it's either going to be the biggest like redemption ever, or it's going to be just
1699160	1700440	the nail in the coffin.
1700440	1707180	Like there is so much writing on Sony's press conference this year, I can't even like imagine.
1707180	1710840	So I am, I'm really curious to see what their thing looks like.
1710840	1713240	This might be one of the things that they're going to announce at the press conference
1713240	1715240	at E3 this year.
1715240	1719280	Apparently there's a God of War portable collection that is going to be coming out to the PlayStation
1719280	1723260	3 in Asian regions in July.
1723260	1727120	That's a press release that was sent by Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan and picked up
1727120	1730220	by international gaming news websites.
1730220	1735580	So apparently the God of War PSP games Chains of Olympus and Ghosts of Sparta are going
1735580	1741000	to be revamped HD Chinese and English language options and will be released on July 7th in
1741000	1742000	Asia.
1742000	1744520	And of course a lot of people kind of their minds go, well, if it's coming out in Asia,
1744520	1746100	why the heck isn't it coming out in the rest of the world?
1746100	1748800	So this could be something that's being announced.
1748800	1749800	In fact...
1749800	1753620	And I mean, if it's going to be in English or, you know, if it's coming out in Asia,
1753620	1756760	you can import it, even if it wasn't coming out right away.
1756760	1757760	Correct.
1757760	1761480	Of course it would not be unlike Sony to repackage God of War.
1761480	1762840	They've done it already.
1762840	1766400	The God of War collection right before God of War 3 came out.
1766400	1771240	The first two PlayStation 2 games were packaged together and re-released.
1771240	1774880	And then I think it's available as a download game now as well.
1774880	1780400	Now taking this a step further, it might not be just God of War.
1780400	1786240	Sony in fact unveiled a new initiative this week where certain PlayStation portable titles
1786240	1792640	will be ported to the PlayStation 3 with improvements made that are, you know, like exactly what
1792640	1794320	we're hearing about the God of War collection.
1794320	1798720	So in my mind, this confirms the God of War thing because Durr, of course, they're going
1798720	1799720	to do the God of War game.
1799720	1800720	They already showed off.
1800720	1801720	That's their biggest franchise.
1801720	1802880	Was it Monster Hunter Portable 3?
1802880	1803880	Yeah.
1803880	1805400	And they have the trailer for it and it looks pretty awesome.
1805400	1806400	Exactly.
1806400	1807400	Yeah.
1807400	1809960	That's the first one that's been announced for it is, thank you for taking my story,
1809960	1810960	Doki.
1810960	1811960	Sorry.
1811960	1812960	Monster Hunter Portable 3.
1812960	1815500	It's going to be released on the PlayStation 3 this summer.
1815500	1819340	More game announcements from more publishers coming down the pipeline.
1819340	1823440	They have not said when it's coming out in other territories, but I can't imagine it's
1823440	1825360	not going to be announced at E3.
1825360	1829100	And that God of War, I'm thinking is all but certain to be a part of this.
1829100	1833260	The question is what other games might be included as part of this?
1833260	1839000	What are the other like huge PlayStation portable titles that could be a part of this?
1839000	1842480	Just throwing it out there, maybe Metal Gear Acid?
1842480	1843600	I don't think they would do Acid.
1843600	1846320	I think that they would do the last- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1846320	1847320	The last one.
1847320	1848320	I'm sorry.
1848320	1849320	Peace Walker.
1849320	1850320	That would be one.
1850320	1851320	Certainly.
1851320	1854120	Well, we'd learn about that pretty quick if that was going to be the case because Konami
1854120	1857440	had probably announced it during their press conference, which would be that Sunday prior.
1857440	1860920	I'm certainly looking forward to the- Unless they're told not to say that.
1860920	1866120	I'm certainly hoping that those Final Fantasy remakes would be a part of it, although I
1866120	1867120	doubt it.
1867120	1868120	Nah.
1868120	1871080	Plus, I'd be a little bit irritated because I already bought those.
1871080	1876120	I would see that maybe, you know, Dissida or, you know.
1876120	1877120	Oh, yeah.
1877120	1879280	I bet that's a big one.
1879280	1883120	Or the other Final Fantasy game, the seven spin-off-
1883120	1884120	Crisis Core.
1884120	1885120	Crisis Core, thank you.
1885120	1886120	Yeah.
1886120	1887120	Yeah.
1887120	1888120	So, those are definite contenders from Squeenix, absolutely.
1888120	1892040	And who's to say, I mean, they couldn't just do some of these as download games?
1892040	1893040	I mean, why not?
1893040	1895160	I mean, that would make sense to me.
1895160	1896160	Mm-hmm.
1896160	1897160	Absolutely.
1897160	1899280	Maybe the half-minute hero games as well?
1899280	1901280	That would be cool.
1901280	1902280	Yep.
1902280	1907160	So, we'll- This is all but certain to show up at E3, so it's just a matter of what titles
1907160	1910000	and when, so we'll see what happens with that.
1910000	1914760	And what's great about it, though, is like, some of those games, you know, that were kinda,
1914760	1919400	they're just alright, you know, with control-wise, because they didn't have a second analog.
1919400	1920840	Well, now we can fix that.
1920840	1922160	That's true.
1922160	1926120	Or that little nub thing that the PSP has kinda starts to wear on your finger.
1926120	1927120	Am I the only one?
1927120	1929840	Like, I can't use that thing for a long period of time because it hurts.
1929840	1932480	Like, just the texture on that button is yuck.
1932480	1934560	I don't know.
1934560	1939040	I actually had a replacement, so I could, you know, put on there, but I never had a
1939040	1940040	problem with it.
1940040	1941560	Alright, I guess it's just me.
1941560	1942560	Movin' on!
1942560	1943920	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
1943920	1946080	There's some Mortal Kombat news out there.
1946080	1951640	Basically, with the PlayStation 3, you had the combat pass so that you could, um, it's-
1951640	1955440	you'd have to have it to play online, but you can only, of course, use it while PlayStation
1955440	1958840	Store is online, which, of course, it wasn't, so it's being waived.
1958840	1963240	Until everything is, uh, you know, pretty much back up full-time.
1963240	1968200	You know, I didn't even really think about that until I'd heard about this story, because
1968200	1972120	I cashed in my pass because I bought the game the day it came out, or, excuse me, I had
1972120	1973880	Amazon delivery the day it came out.
1973880	1978280	So I cashed in my pass that day, and the next day is when PlayStation went down, so I never
1978280	1979280	had a problem.
1979280	1980360	I was able to play online.
1980360	1984120	But it didn't occur to me that, oh yeah, with the store being down, you can't redeem those
1984120	1985120	passes.
1985120	1988080	So if you didn't get this game on launch day, you were screwed.
1988080	1994560	So they're actually waiving the need for the pass until PlayStation Store is fully operational.
1994560	1998280	And good, that's the right thing to do, but, um, I don't feel sorry for them for the amount
1998280	2002880	of shit they probably got from their fan base and threatens of lawsuits and so forth, because
2002880	2006280	that's what you get for putting these passes in the game in the first place, and it really
2006280	2007900	doesn't just end with Mortal Kombat.
2007900	2009120	This is a growing trend.
2009120	2010920	Capcom, Capcom, Capcom, Capcom.
2010920	2011920	Yeah.
2011920	2012920	And the bummer-
2012920	2013920	No, actually, you know, here's the thing.
2013920	2015560	Capcom isn't doing that at all.
2015560	2017280	I mean, they're doing that with their download-
2017280	2018280	With their DRM.
2018280	2022680	Well, their DRM with their download content sucks, but they're not one of these game,
2022680	2026320	you know, companies putting out this, oh, we gotta buy it new in order to play online
2026320	2027320	for free.
2027320	2029520	You know, that's kinda bullshit.
2029520	2034600	THQ, THQ, THQ, and now Warner Brothers is kinda following suit with EA.
2034600	2036640	So those are your evil three right there.
2036640	2039720	And what's most interesting about this is that the people that were affected ended up
2039720	2043440	being the ones who bought the game new, because nobody's buying Mortal Kombat used right now.
2043440	2048160	Like, maybe one in a thousand have already given the game back, and maybe were able to
2048160	2052360	get a used copy from that, but, you know, Mortal Kombat's doing very well in the sales,
2052360	2056680	and this has been a successful reboot, absolutely, and, you know, people are talking about what
2056680	2058080	a great game it is, including me.
2058080	2062720	I think it's the best Mortal Kombat they've done since the Super Nintendo days, to be
2062720	2063720	quite honest.
2063720	2067280	Honestly, I think if what's gonna happen here, the whole reason that they're doing those
2067280	2071040	online passes anyways is trying to recoup some money that you're losing from piracy,
2071040	2075760	because if you wanna play it online, you gotta pay, you know, the ten dollars, which some
2075760	2079880	people have no problem doing, especially if they've pirated the game.
2079880	2081280	But I don't know.
2081280	2082520	I still think it's dumb.
2082520	2087900	Well, and it's especially dumb that when I am supporting the company and I buy it new,
2087900	2090160	that I get locked out.
2090160	2091160	You know what I mean?
2091160	2095120	Or they realize that they probably had to set everything up before they could announce
2095120	2096120	it, so.
2096120	2098800	I know, but there were certainly a few days there where they probably got a lot of shit
2098800	2099800	from people.
2099800	2101240	And I understand they deserved it.
2101240	2104700	Even still, though, I mean, people, someone bought that copy at one time, so they already
2104700	2106480	made their sale for it.
2106480	2108280	Why do they need more money after the fact?
2108280	2109560	Because someone else decides to play.
2109560	2113000	That'd be like, you know, oh, hey, Rob, you know, I watched this DVD once and I'm gonna
2113000	2114000	loan it to you.
2114000	2116240	You know, should the company get money for that?
2116240	2117600	No, because they already bought it once.
2117600	2119320	They already got the money made from that.
2119320	2122500	If they wanted, you know, a pay-per-view service or something like that, then they should do
2122500	2123500	something different.
2123500	2126360	Let me go to our chatroom at chat.orangelauntrader.com.
2126360	2129840	Tigerclaw in our chat says, not only that, anyone who bought a game that comes with a
2129840	2133960	code for some DLC in the box, they can't redeem it until the store goes back up.
2133960	2139560	Yeah, like, funny enough, although I redeemed the combat pass, I did not redeem my reptile
2139560	2143360	original outfit that I got for buying the game, but I don't, you know, I'm a little
2143360	2145000	less, it's a stupid costume.
2145000	2149800	Like I'm not, the Barbie features, I'm not so bent out of shape about, you know, it doesn't
2149800	2152120	really impact the game.
2152120	2154840	But I mean, it's certainly still a valid point.
2154840	2158840	Maybe some other games had DLC that were impacted by this.
2158840	2161840	So there you go.
2161840	2166160	Frisbee in our chatroom flat out says, DRM is a poison.
2166160	2170040	It's such a bummer because I get why companies have to do it.
2170040	2174880	I mean, obviously, piracy is an issue and it is something that has to be dealt with.
2174880	2179220	But it just sucks when the people that get affected most by the change is the ones that
2179220	2181240	are trying to do everything legitimately.
2181240	2184060	Oh well.
2184060	2185060	It never ends.
2185060	2186060	Moving on.
2186060	2187060	New story, Loki.
2187060	2188060	Yeah.
2188060	2192960	So there's a rumor that the new Nintendo console that's supposed to be announced at E3 is gonna
2192960	2196080	have a front-facing camera built into the controller.
2196080	2201040	Which, you know, I think that was one of the, part of the rumors that was going around for
2201040	2202040	a while now.
2202040	2207480	And it makes sense, so, if you think about it, if this is supposed to be, you know, a
2207480	2214880	controller with a 6-inch touchscreen on it and you have a widescreen TV, hmm, could possibly
2214880	2223200	they be, I don't know, adding DS or DSi download games to the virtual console or whatever they're
2223200	2224800	gonna call that.
2224800	2229040	Because now, you'll have your touchscreen and your one screen in your controller and
2229040	2231720	your other screen is up on TV.
2231720	2235720	But then, of course, I have to say is, why would you spend more money on a controller,
2235720	2240440	which I'm assuming is gonna be at least 100 bucks, you know, when you can buy a DS.
2240440	2241440	Or DSi.
2241440	2242440	I don't know.
2242440	2243440	But.
2243440	2244440	Really?
2244440	2248200	Cause when I heard about this, I was thinking more of the Kinect-style features, but I guess
2248200	2250640	that doesn't work if it's on a controller, does it?
2250640	2251960	I really think that one through.
2251960	2253400	Let me put it this way.
2253400	2261760	This sounds like this console is gonna have gimmicks out the ass.
2261760	2265760	It's like, what possible gimmicks can we throw in on this thing?
2265760	2272200	It's got motion controls, it's got a touchscreen, it's got a camera on it, it's got, you know,
2272200	2277400	a microwave, I mean, what else can we throw on this fucking, I just have to see how they're
2277400	2285820	gonna use it because, I'm gonna tell you this much, all the Nintendo gimmicks that have
2285820	2287560	been out there haven't been that great.
2287560	2291480	I mean, the motion control stuff, yeah, but then you get all these launch games that are
2291480	2296760	all these just waggle this, waggle this one, it could have been just a button for all that.
2296760	2305040	Or you know, just the Zapper, or the Wii Fit balance board, or motion plus, I mean a lot
2305040	2313920	of it is just rehash, you know, or just like gimmicky game that's not really that original.
2313920	2316560	It's just like all this extra crap that you don't really need in there.
2316560	2321200	So if they're throwing in all these gimmicks, they gotta be doing something really smart
2321200	2322200	there.
2322200	2325280	I think the problem why it seems like there's so many gimmicks as well is because we're
2325280	2328840	in that rumor phase where just people are just fucking making shit up, and I'm not even
2328840	2331600	sure I totally agree with this rumor.
2331600	2336400	Like it could, I think it's just somebody making a good odds prediction.
2336400	2340760	You know, cameras being integrated into devices is a pretty common thing these days, you know,
2340760	2342680	between the DS and the iPhone.
2342680	2347260	I think someone's just hedging their bets to make a rumor and all that stuff.
2347260	2350080	So I'm not so sure that makes it true.
2350080	2351440	I mean, we'll see.
2351440	2352440	We'll see, I mean...
2352440	2357600	But I just want to remind everyone, at one point the Wii was supposed to project 3D imagery
2357600	2358600	all on its own.
2358600	2363520	It was a magical little fucking box where you would just, it's the holodeck, and that
2363520	2368040	didn't quite end up being the case, actually, so...
2368040	2373840	I don't know, I'm just, I have very, like I said, I have very low expectations for this
2373840	2374840	new console.
2374840	2380080	And remember, you know, the other thing too, you have to remember about Nintendo, half
2380080	2385040	the stuff they promise will not make it at launch, or at all.
2385040	2388240	I mean, they're going to promise you all this stuff that this console's going to be doing.
2388240	2391600	Oh yeah, that feature's not done yet, it's not going to be out for six months after the
2391600	2392600	console's release.
2392600	2397140	Like, you know, the 3DS, I mean, come on, that's just stupid.
2397140	2401560	You can't release a console that's halfway done, and then your sales are pretty shitty
2401560	2407080	as it is, and then stuff that's promised at the launch of that stuff, you know, it's just
2407080	2408800	delay after delay.
2408800	2412400	I'm not quite as negative as Loki is on this issue.
2412400	2415920	Really Nintendo really only needs to do just a couple things to make me buy the new system,
2415920	2420800	as long as it's high definition and capable of pretty graphics, and it has a new F-Zero
2420800	2427440	game on it, and it has a type of controller that's not quite so gimmicky where maybe,
2427440	2430800	I understand there's going to be some gimmick of some sort, but as long as we can kind of
2430800	2433520	tone it down a little bit, I'll be in.
2433520	2434520	I'm fine.
2434520	2435600	Even like two out of three ain't bad.
2435600	2438800	If they don't really give me an F-Zero game, I guess I can't be that upset, but I really
2438800	2439800	want it.
2439800	2442400	Just say, I really, really want an F-Zero game.
2442400	2444920	And now would be a perfect time.
2444920	2448640	Unless this whole touch thing ends up actually being true, because I don't know how you'd
2448640	2452480	incorporate that into an F-Zero game, but again, I think the touch thing is utter bullshit.
2452480	2457880	Like I think it's total bullshit, but I guess we'll see, I could be wrong.
2457880	2462080	Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about the 360.
2462080	2465680	We've talked Sony, we've talked Nintendo, let's talk 360 for a little bit here.
2465680	2472720	There is an update coming, and yeah, the firmware update, unfortunately, it's sporking some
2472720	2479560	consoles from playing newer games, because it has to do with the way that they're changing
2479560	2482700	the game discs to try and circumvent piracy.
2482700	2486720	They're changing the retail game discs, and it's also going to be, I guess, freeing up
2486720	2490400	a gig of space, which is good news for the folks that are trying to cram a lot into one
2490400	2491400	disc.
2491400	2498320	But the problem is, is that certain types of drives don't actually read these discs
2498320	2502160	okay, so their 360s might actually be borked.
2502160	2507800	Now, here's the deal, Microsoft is actually being proactive about finding where those
2507800	2513560	issues are, and they're actually going to send them, I guess, a new Xbox.
2513560	2515820	At least that's what the rumors say.
2515820	2519940	The official Microsoft statement says, following a recent update to our system software, we
2519940	2524400	have become aware of an issue that is preventing a very small number of Xbox 360 owners from
2524400	2526220	playing retail game discs.
2526220	2530900	This issue manifests itself as a unique disc unreadable or disc unsupported error on the
2530900	2534080	screen and is unrelated to our recent public beta.
2534080	2539520	We are also able to detect this issue over Xbox Live and are proactively reaching out
2539520	2543160	to customers that may be impacted to replace their console.
2543160	2548640	Many Xbox 360 owners receiving this error are encouraged to contact us at Xbox.com support
2548640	2552120	contact, so we can verify if the console has been impacted.
2552120	2557500	Very interesting, using that whole fact that they send information over the internet automatically
2557500	2561660	about your console to Microsoft, they're able to tell exactly who's affected by this and
2561660	2563520	send them replacements.
2563520	2564520	Interesting.
2564520	2570600	Of course, they don't say exactly what percentage, I mean, they say a small amount, but how small?
2570600	2572920	It's a certain drive, I believe, that doesn't work with it.
2572920	2577420	I don't remember which kind, but there is one that I know that the update doesn't work
2577420	2578420	on it.
2578420	2579420	Interesting.
2579420	2584720	It's also one of the, I think, one of the consoles that they haven't had, like, hacked
2584720	2590840	firmware or, like, new hacked firmwares for because, I guess, like, the AP 2.5 checks
2590840	2593520	aren't able to be flashed to it and all this stuff.
2593520	2597720	I wonder if it's the original 360s, but they've all red ringed by now anyway, so that's why
2597720	2598960	it's such a small number.
2598960	2604800	It is one of the original, I think, drives, one of the, either the Samsung Hitachi or
2604800	2605800	the...
2605800	2606800	Interesting.
2606800	2609800	I don't remember the last one there.
2609800	2611600	Toshiba.
2611600	2617080	By the way, also speaking about Xbox 360, PayPal has been rolling out in certain territories.
2617080	2623640	There's an automatic update that was going out, and it's going to certain regions first,
2623640	2628220	and now you can actually use PayPal as a billing option on your console.
2628220	2632440	You can do that for Microsoft Points and other types of Marketplace content.
2632440	2636160	Apparently, that has all been rolling out over the past week.
2636160	2638960	I don't remember updating my console, but it might have been done when I wasn't on it.
2638960	2639960	They haven't been...
2639960	2643480	Like, I didn't get an update on Friday for my consoles.
2643480	2645520	So it's just certain regions right now.
2645520	2650380	May 27th is when Avatar Connect is scheduled to come out, and that is the...
2650380	2654920	If you are too shy to use voice chat, or I'm sorry, video chat, because you know your
2654920	2659440	Connect has video chat, but if you want to use fake people instead to chat, you'll be
2659440	2662000	able to do that on the 27th.
2662000	2664440	Interesting.
2664440	2667480	Let's move on with another news story, and then we'll get to the release dates.
2667480	2673160	Well, going back to Microsoft, there has been word about something that, according to our
2673160	2676280	show role, is the Connect Fub Lab.
2676280	2677280	I'm sorry.
2677280	2680920	Sorry, I have fubby, fat fingers, and I think I meant to type fun.
2680920	2682640	I had to give you a hard time.
2682640	2689040	Now, the Connect Fun Lab might be revealed at E3.
2689040	2693600	They are going to be doing a lot of stuff for the Connect, but there is a source that
2693600	2699520	said that something called Connect Fun Lab is in the works to be revealed there, and
2699520	2701600	not really sure what it is.
2701600	2706260	There's also another possible Connect title that's called Connect Me that's on the Australia
2706260	2710280	Classifications Board and has Microsoft as a publisher.
2710280	2716000	And there's also two others that are probably not Connect games, but there's Crimson Alliance
2716000	2718000	and Fusion Genesis.
2718000	2722920	And Crimson Alliance is being developed by Certain Affinity.
2722920	2724080	Fusion Genesis?
2724080	2725920	I know what that is.
2725920	2727480	That's another Fusion Frenzy game.
2727480	2729480	I know, God, I hate that.
2729480	2730800	God, I hope not.
2730800	2734320	And then Crimson Alliance, that sounds like another Crimson Skies game, which sounds kind
2734320	2735500	of cool.
2735500	2737720	But Fusion Frenzy, no!
2737720	2741000	Crimson Alliance is by Certain Affinity, and they did Age of Booty.
2741000	2742000	Oh.
2742000	2743000	Well.
2743000	2747560	I still don't know if that's what it is, but Fusion Frenzy, ohhhh!
2747560	2749120	Bleh, bleh.
2749120	2750640	It's terrible.
2750640	2752120	Don't make another Fusion Frenzy game.
2752120	2754120	They're all terrible.
2754120	2755120	Alright.
2755120	2760440	Uh, I, I hope, hopefully that isn't what it is, but I'm a little more worried about Connect
2760440	2765640	Fun Lab, because I thought that this year was the year we're going to see at E3 what the
2765640	2767200	Connect can really do.
2767200	2770480	Alright, we've seen all the Nintendo rip-offs, now let's see what the Connect can really
2770480	2771480	do.
2771480	2772480	It can really rip off Nintendo now.
2772480	2777360	I know, and I hear Fun Lab, and I think, oh goody, it's a lab full of minigames.
2777360	2779960	Fun, fun, fun, fun.
2779960	2781240	Or it's all puppies.
2781240	2782240	It's all lab puppies.
2782240	2783240	Ugh.
2783240	2788600	I hope Fun Lab has to do with, like, genetic mutations of, like, you know, people and...
2788600	2789600	Make your own monster.
2789600	2790600	Yes.
2790600	2791600	Create your own alien or something.
2791600	2792600	That would be fun.
2792600	2793600	I don't want fucking minigames.
2793600	2794600	Exactly.
2794600	2795600	That would be Fun Lab.
2795600	2796600	And then you make them fight through Xbox Live.
2796600	2797600	Yes.
2797600	2798600	And it's okay.
2798600	2799600	Kind of like Magic Pen Gel.
2799600	2800600	It's all virtual.
2800600	2801600	It's not real.
2801600	2802600	Yeah.
2802600	2803600	There you go.
2803600	2804600	A Magic Pen Gel where I draw with my hands.
2804600	2807640	I smear paint to make creatures.
2807640	2810320	Like it's a monkey smearing poop on the wall.
2810320	2811440	That would be great.
2811440	2812440	Fun Lab.
2812440	2813440	I would play that.
2813440	2815440	Monkey Poo Fun Lab.
2815440	2816820	I would play that.
2816820	2818280	Monkey Poo Fun Lab.
2818280	2819600	Alright.
2819600	2822320	Let's go around the world and look at some release dates.
2822320	2825760	That sounds terrible, Monkey Poo Fun Lab.
2825760	2830040	This week, actually, there's some decent stuff coming out.
2830040	2839120	Dirt 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week, which is pretty cool.
2839120	2841400	Adding Gymkhana this time.
2841400	2845720	Kung Fu Panda 2, another movie tie-in game.
2845720	2849840	And this one, it's a little weird, they're doing something different on every single
2849840	2850840	platform.
2850840	2854480	The PlayStation 3 game is just, you know, just a PlayStation 3 game.
2854480	2858480	The Xbox 360 is getting a Kinect game.
2858480	2862400	The Wii is getting a U-Draw game.
2862400	2867360	And then DS is just, you know, another regular DS game.
2867360	2871040	So those will be out later this week.
2871040	2878760	And then, let's see here, man this is fucking slow today.
2878760	2881960	Other fun stuff.
2881960	2883600	Like what?
2883600	2886080	Like Monkey Poo Smear.
2886080	2887320	Monkey Poo Smear, yes.
2887320	2891920	Monkey Poo Smear is coming out this week on all platforms, including the Atari.
2891920	2892920	Looks very exciting.
2892920	2896520	No, um, I'm trying to see what else we have here.
2896520	2902860	It's a really small week, but I know it's more than just those two titles.
2902860	2905700	Come on, cooperate.
2905700	2906700	There we go.
2906700	2910920	Dungeons and Dragons Daggerdale for PC, that's coming out this week.
2910920	2917060	Also Naughty Bear, the Gold Edition, in case you didn't buy that game.
2917060	2921240	It's coming out now with all the download content at a budget price on PlayStation 3
2921240	2923640	and Xbox 360.
2923640	2928640	NASCAR 2011 on the Wii, been delayed a little bit so now it's finally coming out.
2928640	2934080	Paws and Claws Pampered Pets 2 for Nintendo DS, out this week as well.
2934080	2939280	And Murder in Venice, kind of an adventure game that's also for DS.
2939280	2944040	Cake Mania Main Street, that's on DS this week.
2944040	2950440	And that is pretty much it.
2950440	2957600	Well we have some news for the U.S., for overseas in the UK.
2957600	2959520	And it's actually just a few games.
2959520	2966640	On the 24th we have Dirt 3 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.
2966640	2969680	And we also have Kung Fu Panda for the DS.
2969680	2973960	And on the 27th is Gladiator Begins on the PSP.
2973960	2978680	And on the 30th we have Fable 3 for PC, which why it's taken so dang long to come out, oh
2978680	2979680	well, don't know.
2979680	2981920	But I don't know.
2981920	2985560	Fable 3, I will go ahead and warn our UK viewers.
2985560	2988960	Now I've got friends that love, why do I say viewers, it's listeners.
2988960	2994040	I've got friends that love Fable 3, but it's really not all that great.
2994040	2996360	Fable 2 is so much of a better game.
2996360	2999360	What do you think?
2999360	3004280	Fable 2 is alright, but Fable 3 didn't look like they added too much stuff to it, so I
3004280	3006880	passed on it.
3006880	3011560	I can't trust anything Peter Milano says, he's full of shit.
3011560	3013680	That means that he needs to probably go potty.
3013680	3014680	Yes.
3014680	3016680	Except every time he potties a new game comes out.
3016680	3018320	That's true.
3018320	3019320	Yeah.
3019320	3025880	And, well, I have really nothing else on, for UK, I mean, they list games but they don't
3025880	3029840	put dates on them, like Back to the Future Double Vision is on the list, but they didn't
3029840	3032320	put a date on it, so.
3032320	3033320	That's all.
3033320	3036800	And speaking of stuff that's coming out.
3036800	3040400	Can we go to Japan and take a look at the Japanese releases?
3040400	3041400	Yes.
3041400	3047280	Oh, let's see, we're gonna start off on the Xbox 360 and this week on the 26th, Akai Katana
3047280	3049760	Shin comes out on the 360.
3049760	3052840	And that is gonna be in regular and limited edition.
3052840	3054640	And now that's from Cave.
3054640	3056120	That's it?
3056120	3058560	Akai Katana Shin comes out this week.
3058560	3060120	That's Red Katana New?
3060120	3061120	Death?
3061120	3065320	It takes place in a parallel world that resembles Japan's Taisho period.
3065320	3069320	Here people discovered a blood sword that takes human sacrifices to unleash its mass
3069320	3070960	destructive power.
3070960	3073120	That would be Red Sword Death then.
3073120	3075320	Now this is an existing game that's already been out.
3075320	3079680	The 360 version will have new stages, new characters, and a new system, and the graphics
3079680	3080680	will fit in a 16-9.
3080680	3085360	So I'm assuming this is a prior 16, I'm sorry, a prior PlayStation 2 release.
3085360	3088800	So that is coming out this week and it's a shooter.
3088800	3089800	Of course, it's a shooter.
3089800	3090800	It's Cave.
3090800	3091800	What'd you expect?
3091800	3097040	Also coming out on the Xbox 360, Fighters Uncaged and Troy Musou comes out this week.
3097040	3102640	And I'm not sure what this, oh this is about like, like Trojan Troy, Helen of Troy, all
3102640	3103640	that stuff.
3103640	3109360	It's myth, oh, Warriors Legend of Troy for Japan?
3109360	3114080	diversity Warriors, but with the Trojan horse, not the Trojan condoms with the Trojan horse.
3114080	3116800	That'll be a whole nother type of game.
3116800	3123840	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Hiro no Kakira Aizoban Akane Hiro no Suyoku comes out this
3123840	3127600	week from Idea Factory in regular and limited edition.
3127600	3131000	And this game is an adventure game.
3131000	3134480	I'm trying to see what it is.
3134480	3139480	It's gotta be something that I've heard of before because it's regular and limited.
3139480	3143320	Let me see, trying to get some screenshots here and it's an adventure game.
3143320	3145000	No, I guess not.
3145000	3148120	The artwork on this does not look familiar to me.
3148120	3149800	So it's some type of new game we don't have here.
3149800	3153280	Well, yeah, it looks like every other.
3153280	3157160	Infamous goes into the best series, meaning it gets a price reduction.
3157160	3161740	Nobunaga no Yabu, Tendo and a power-up kit, woohoo, come out this week.
3161740	3166360	That's 124 bucks if you want both of those to import.
3166360	3174080	Also, Tottori no Atlier, Arland no Rekin ju Shutsi 2 goes into the best hits collection
3174080	3175560	as well.
3175560	3178320	So some price reductions this week.
3178320	3181480	Going to the Nintendo systems, taking a look real quick.
3181480	3186740	Nintendo Wii, Pandora's Tower, Until I Return to Your Side comes out on the Wii this week.
3186740	3189280	And of course I hear Pandora and I go, wait a minute, wasn't that what they call the Kid
3189280	3190520	Icarus games over in Japan?
3190520	3194400	It was called like Pandora's, I thought this was what it was called, Pandora's Adventure
3194400	3195400	or something like that.
3195400	3198600	Wasn't Kid Icarus called that in Japan?
3198600	3202040	But that is not what this is, just so you know, it is not like a Kid Icarus game.
3202040	3204020	It's some other type of game on the Wii.
3204020	3207240	And it's in a black box instead of a white Wii box.
3207240	3209040	So ooh.
3209040	3217160	Let's see, going on to the Nintendo 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP comes out this week.
3217160	3222920	And lastly, going to the PSP, Shutsugeki, what?
3222920	3229680	Kid Icarus Hikari Shinwa, Palthena no Kagami, which is Light Myth Palthena's Mirror.
3229680	3231680	Palthena's Mirror, not Pandora, Palthena.
3231680	3234200	Okay, so I missed, P something.
3234200	3236280	But it had like a totally different name in Japan.
3236280	3238520	At least I was like 20% right.
3238520	3239840	That's a much cooler name.
3239840	3243120	It is kind of a cool name, but I don't know, Kid Icarus kind of grew on me.
3243120	3244120	It's cool.
3244120	3254280	Anyhow, the game I was reading on the PSP, Shutsugeki no Senjotou comes out from System
3254280	3257680	Soft this week on the PSP.
3257680	3263280	And this is a strategy game that involves anime chicks in hot outfits.
3263280	3266400	And then like, okay, look at these screenshots, okay?
3266400	3268760	You get like hot anime babe, right?
3268760	3272060	And then you have like anime babes in like little maid outfits, right?
3272060	3277800	And then it's driving in the streets with tanks and airplanes.
3277800	3280880	This is a very manly sort of game.
3280880	3285040	Hot anime babes and then tanks and fighter jets.
3285040	3286800	Awesome.
3286800	3288400	Pre-ordering it today.
3288400	3290760	All right.
3290760	3294600	Let's move on and go over a couple more news stories and we'll get into the classic game
3294600	3295600	of the week.
3295600	3299360	Dark Soccer has picked a very popular series tonight.
3299360	3300360	So we'll get to that.
3300360	3303080	All right, for now though, Loki.
3303080	3304320	Ah yes.
3304320	3309240	So this is kind of disappointing because this was actually a game I was looking forward
3309240	3319680	to checking out once the delayed Nintendo store for the 3DS was released.
3319680	3323400	But yes, like all things delayed, there are more delays.
3323400	3327920	And Mega Man Legends 3 prototype version, a demo for a game that's not even finished
3327920	3337240	yet, will be delayed from the 3DS eShop launch on June 6th.
3337240	3338600	That is terrible.
3338600	3341520	And they haven't really said yet when it's going to be released.
3341520	3353000	But I guess you have to wait.
3353000	3360200	And this is for that demo, basically, of the potential Mega Man Legends 3 game that might
3360200	3365680	come out should enough people pay to get this demo concept of what it could possibly be.
3365680	3367480	Yeah, that's a big ol' fuck you to Capcom.
3367480	3368480	I'm sorry.
3368480	3377680	Oh well, you know, we may make this game, but you have to pay for this demo and we may.
3377680	3378680	We'll see.
3378680	3381120	To be honest, I'll probably buy it anyway.
3381120	3383600	As long as, okay, here's my little stipulation.
3383600	3387200	I guess we won't really know because of course we're not going to get told, but my wish is
3387200	3393080	as long as the game I'm not buying here in the DS shop ends up being a part of the actual
3393080	3394260	full game.
3394260	3398480	Like I do not want to be paying for what will be the first two chapters of the retail release.
3398480	3402740	Like a side story or a leading into game, those are fine.
3402740	3405320	Like a case zero is perfectly acceptable.
3405320	3406320	That's fine.
3406320	3409120	But I don't want something that's just going to end up being like the first chapter of
3409120	3410120	the game.
3410120	3414480	I, you know, Capcom was also behind the Dead Rising case zero, which was actually a pretty
3414480	3415960	cool little idea.
3415960	3422000	So my hope is they're going to get this one right too, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
3422000	3426080	L.A. Noire is a game that a lot of people are talking about this week and it's a very
3426080	3428600	kind of different sort of rock star game from what I understand.
3428600	3431360	People are going into it expecting 1940s Grand Theft Auto.
3431360	3435960	That's not quite what they're getting, but the game seems to be pretty well received
3435960	3440400	unless you're one of these people that are affected by the overheating.
3440400	3446880	Apparently firmware 3.61 on the PlayStation 3 is causing certain Sony consoles to overheat
3446880	3449360	when playing L.A. Noire.
3449360	3452080	This is according to Rockstar's own customer support.
3452080	3457520	Quote, we have received some reports of PlayStation 3's overheating while playing L.A. Noire or
3457520	3462960	beeping three times before shutting down and turning themselves off, mostly on older 60
3462960	3464480	and 80 gig fat models.
3464480	3466960	Oh shit, I have one of these models.
3466960	3472560	Primary reports seem to be that updating to firmware 3.61 will cause PlayStations to overheat.
3472560	3476080	There have been various reports of this on a few different games now, all reporting their
3476080	3480440	PlayStation 3's turning off or red lighting after having installed 3.61.
3480440	3481440	Yikes.
3481440	3487840	Well now, if you're an Xbox fan boy pointing and laughing and kicking Sony while they're
3487840	3489560	down, hold it.
3489560	3490560	Because guess what?
3490560	3496120	Apparently the Xbox 360 version is locking up as well.
3496120	3500560	According to a poster on the Xbox.com forums, quote, it's been freezing since the first
3500560	3501560	mission.
3501560	3504360	Now I'm about four in and it won't stop freezing.
3504360	3509080	Rockstar has advised that folks, quote, clear the 360 cache.
3509080	3514920	So there are reported instances that Microsoft's system is having issues with this as well.
3514920	3520520	So Rockstar, you know, of course was blaming Sony originally, but now that the Xbox stuff
3520520	3523560	is coming to light, they've changed a little bit.
3523560	3527600	Here's their latest statement, quote, we've received a very small number of customer support
3527600	3532080	questions about PS3s overheating or shutting down while playing LA Noire.
3532080	3536720	At this time, Rockstar Games and Sony can confirm that neither LA Noire or firmware
3536720	3540840	update 3.61 are causing the PS3 hardware to overheat.
3540840	3544640	We are both committed to working hard to find solutions to this and any issues that may
3544640	3545640	arise.
3545640	3549880	Well, if that isn't the vaguest fucking thing I've ever heard, it's not the game and it's
3549880	3551240	not the system.
3551240	3554920	And there's really nothing else between that that would cause your system to overheat.
3554920	3559600	It's just you is really what I'm hearing in that statement.
3559600	3561520	It's not the system and it's not the game.
3561520	3563000	It's just you.
3563000	3566280	It's not me, it's you.
3566280	3569700	I mean, what the fuck kind of press release is that?
3569700	3574680	Why not say we recognize the problem and we are working on a solution?
3574680	3575920	Oh, my God.
3575920	3579040	How hard was that?
3579040	3580040	Very hard.
3580040	3582520	Not like Sony hasn't got bigger problems right now.
3582520	3586280	This is more just that corporate bullshit.
3586280	3588200	Like stop it.
3588200	3590320	Just be real with the consumers.
3590320	3592960	We see through your crap.
3592960	3594860	Yes.
3594860	3600880	We need to go back into a time when gaming wasn't so full of such asshattery and bullshit.
3600880	3608080	And it's a segment we call the classic game of the week, where we turn back the clock,
3608080	3611240	take a stroll down memory lane and find a classic game in the archives.
3611240	3615240	The Dark Sakura says, hey, listen up, brats.
3615240	3619680	You should be playing this game or I'll set your PlayStation 3 on fire myself.
3619680	3620880	You won't even need L anymore.
3620880	3624960	I'll have my engineers invent combustible lemons that'll burn your PS3 down.
3624960	3625960	There you go.
3625960	3630320	What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?
3630320	3631320	Mother.
3631320	3641640	Mother is, well, as we all know, is the precursor to Mother 2, which came out over here as Earthbound.
3641640	3652560	Now this was, it came out on the Famicon and it came out in, I'm trying to find the year
3652560	3654400	and it doesn't list the year on here.
3654400	3655400	1989.
3655400	3656400	Yeah, 1989.
3656400	3657400	Sorry.
3657400	3660560	And it was actually, it was published by Nintendo.
3660560	3666760	It was produced by Miyamoto and written by Shigesato Itoi.
3666760	3670800	So has some fantastic names behind it.
3670800	3675000	It was developed by Ape and Panexsoftica and Nintendo Tokyo.
3675000	3678640	At any rate, it was an RPG.
3678640	3684720	It never had a release outside of Japan, although it was initially supposed to be released.
3684720	3689240	They had already started localizing it to be the first Earthbound.
3689240	3693240	And basically that's also when the SNES was coming out.
3693240	3696480	And so they decided to use Mother 2 instead.
3696480	3698080	They localized that.
3698080	3703920	So there is an official localized prototype of the game and that was actually put out
3703920	3705000	by Demiforce.
3705000	3713600	They used the ROM data that was from the prototype and it's being put out as Earthbound Zero.
3713600	3717480	And that actually made it out in 1998.
3717480	3723400	The game itself has field maps and a battle system.
3723400	3728400	It doesn't use, it doesn't use an overworld map.
3728400	3734600	It just basically, sorry, my throat's getting messed up.
3734600	3738440	Basically you can go around and talk to other NPCs, you can buy equipment, items.
3738440	3742320	You can, you know, stay in hotels, you can go to other buildings.
3742320	3746780	And in the, if you use a telephone, you can actually, your character can talk to Daddy
3746780	3747780	who gives you money.
3747780	3749640	And he saves your progress.
3749640	3756400	The main character's name is Ninten by the way, I thought that's funny.
3756400	3762880	So when you are on the field map, because like I said it doesn't have an overworld map
3762880	3767040	just as field maps, you will be attacked by enemies and then you go into battle mode where
3767040	3769280	it's a first person view.
3769280	3776880	And you attack the creature or whatever, like a lamp, through the different menu system
3776880	3781200	commands and you have different actions for different characters.
3781200	3789720	And you also can do different moves in order that are based on the character's speed statistics.
3789720	3794420	And you also of course get experience and level up that way.
3794420	3798440	And if you lose all of your hit points, then you go to the hospital and you have to pay
3798440	3802000	to revive your characters.
3802000	3806280	And if every character dies, you don't lose your progress, but you go back to the last
3806280	3813000	area that you saved at with only Ninten alive and half of your money.
3813000	3815320	So that's kind of crappy, huh?
3815320	3816320	So at any rate.
3816320	3817320	That's harsh.
3817320	3822800	That sounds harder than the pirated version of Earthbound where it would delete your own
3822800	3826120	saved game when you got to the last boss, remember that?
3826120	3827120	Yeah.
3827120	3831280	Oh, after doubling the difficulty?
3831280	3837980	At any rate, the game talks about a married couple in America who vanished after a dark
3837980	3840120	shadow covered their town.
3840120	3847780	Two years later, George, the husband, returns mysteriously and then he starts studying in
3847780	3851320	complete seclusion and his wife Maria is never heard from again.
3851320	3858420	So you fast forward to 1988 where there's a 12 year old boy named Ninten who is attacked
3858420	3861740	by a paranormal event.
3861740	3864320	And actually he looks a lot like Ness.
3864320	3869240	Of course, Ness was the one in Earthbound.
3869240	3874200	So he's got psychic powers and he likes penguins, Rob.
3874200	3875200	Smart kid.
3875200	3876840	He likes penguins.
3876840	3884880	So at any rate, he finds out that an invading race is, an alien race is, you know, invading
3884880	3891480	and so they go to the world of Magicant where the ruler there, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to
3891480	3894880	find her a song called the Eight Melodies and play it to her.
3894880	3896780	Play all the songs to her.
3896780	3906000	So he meets up with a dude named Lloyd and a girl named Ana and she dreamed about him.
3906000	3907000	Ooh.
3907000	3911680	So that's the start of the game and you keep, you know, going through and you duel some
3911680	3923240	dude named Teddy and you have to, it's actually funny because you have to, the Queen tells
3923240	3928000	you about an alien named, I'm hoping that I'm pronouncing this right, but I think it's
3928000	3934840	Gigu, that's spelled G-Y-I-Y-G or something, but it's Gigu, which is actually the same
3934840	3942800	way it was initially romanized for Earthbound in the unreleased translation.
3942800	3949060	So it pretty much, you know, more fun going saving the universe and the game actually
3949060	3957560	did get a re-release in 2003 with Mother 2 and the tagline was no crying until the end
3957560	3961520	and a guaranteed masterpiece.
3961520	3968880	So it was actually designed by a Japanese copywriter and television personality Shigesato
3968880	3973720	Itoi and the inspiration for the game was from John Lennon's song Mother and he also
3973720	3977140	wanted the game to have a name that wasn't game-like.
3977140	3980400	I didn't know that part, that's interesting.
3980400	3986540	And I like this quote here, it said that the last parts of Mother were not tested for bugs
3986540	3992240	and balance issues and when talking about it at a promotional event he humorously stated
3992240	3997400	when we got to fine-tuning the difficulty there I was like whatever.
3997400	4002880	So yeah there's a lot of people and I've started playing it a while back but never really got
4002880	4008100	too much further into it who says this is a game that you have to grind and grind and
4008100	4011540	grind and grind to get through.
4011540	4017480	So at any rate, like I said it was going to be put out in the US as Earthbound, actually
4017480	4019440	two words, Earthbound.
4019440	4024240	And the localization was finished in 1990 but the release kept getting pushed back into
4024240	4027300	fall of 1991 and then it got put on hold.
4027300	4036200	So the guy who was the producer and script writer, Phil Sandhop, he said and I'm quoting
4036200	4042640	once the NES squatted in the pipeline and shoved the game aside from its appointed time
4042640	4045840	I believe that the marketing execs just decided that the game would be too expensive to produce
4045840	4050600	and unsuccessful without marketing and that's why it fell into oblivion.
4050600	4054800	They were doing a lot of stuff in localization which was removing blood from enemy sprites
4054800	4059440	which was a censorship thing they had at the time and they were going to extend the game's
4059440	4060440	ending.
4060440	4067120	So at any rate, Demiforce, as I mentioned before, found a beta cartridge on the internet
4067120	4070400	and they collected enough money to buy the game.
4070400	4075280	I remember when that happened, I was in college and that was all going on.
4075280	4081440	And so they actually had to do modified versions with the copy protection disabled and renamed
4081440	4086360	it Earthbound Zero so that it could separate it from Earthbound.
4086360	4095040	And they actually put everything out, I mean I thought it was neat that they bought the
4095040	4099200	rights to do it so that was pretty cool.
4099200	4107880	The music in it was done by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka and it was actually released
4107880	4118040	on CD and cassette by Sony on August 21st, 1989 and it had 11 tracks and 7 of them are
4118040	4119040	vocal remakes.
4119040	4127560	So it's got the 8 melodies on there, one called Pollyanna and actually on February 18th, 2004
4127560	4132400	the soundtrack was re-released, digitally remastered and songs from it appear in Earthbound,
4132400	4137640	Mother 3, Super Smash Bros Melee and Super Smash Bros Brawl.
4137640	4145880	So there's actually some pretty big names that were included with the CD, including
4145880	4149220	the St. Paul's Cathedral Choir.
4149220	4156080	It sold 400,000 copies in Japan and in two pulls by Famitsu it was the 9th best game
4156080	4159960	for the Famicon and the 38th best game of all time.
4159960	4165080	It was the 4th most wanted virtual console game in June 2008 according to Nintendo Power
4165080	4168520	and moved up to the 2nd most wanted.
4168520	4173520	So it was called Dark and Mature and that's the game.
4173520	4180200	Alright, your classic game of the week, Mother or Earthbound Zero, the original that most
4180200	4182320	folks in the US have never seen.
4182320	4183320	Yep.
4183320	4184320	Alright.
4184320	4187800	Good pick, that's a great series and you know that series had a lot of rabid fans.
4187800	4191580	It does seem ridiculous that Nintendo really just kind of let it die.
4191580	4197000	I mean, I think I get some of the reasons behind it but I don't know, it was a pretty
4197000	4200440	cute little RPG franchise that Nintendo had and it's just kind of a bummer that they couldn't
4200440	4201440	work around some of that.
4201440	4205160	Like I understand maybe why things can't be re-released but it's a bummer they can't,
4205160	4211600	you know, get that, you know, the same kind of like concept and the whole modern RPG thing
4211600	4216200	and kind of make it work with the new game but maybe some things are just left better
4216200	4217200	as classics.
4217200	4220840	Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a break but don't go anywhere
4220840	4221840	guys.
4221840	4226240	We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a break.
4226240	4229880	Coming up after the break, we've got stories about Portal 2.
4229880	4234040	Apparently, some folks find that game highly offensive when we're talking about who and
4234040	4236000	why in a little while.
4236000	4240960	Some other Portal 2 news and E3 news already starting to come in, how you can actually
4240960	4242280	go to one of the press conferences.
4242280	4246240	We're going to talk a little bit about that when we come back after a quick break with

4272400	4275280	for some other projects that we do which we actually referenced already at the top of
4275280	4278320	the show but we're going to sell them again because you know what?
4278320	4282240	We don't really advertise anything on this show except our other shows.
4282240	4284240	So here's your commercial.
4284240	4285800	Darcyra what's your show?
4285800	4293920	Comic Insanity which is at Infamous.net N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net and we talk about comics but we also
4293920	4303480	have a new segment where we talk about a classic comic of the week and we also have what Shadow
4303480	4309680	calls the random encounter which is talking about an old RPG.
4309680	4311280	Classic RPG so.
4311280	4312280	Very cool.
4312280	4315440	Throwing a little video game spin in your comic show.
4315440	4316440	A little bit.
4316440	4318440	You're trying to leave us aren't you?
4318440	4321480	No never never never never never.
4321480	4324560	This is my big baby.
4324560	4328160	Your big nine year old crying bratty baby that says shit a lot.
4328160	4329160	Yes.
4329160	4333160	I'm going to have to wash its mouth out with some lye soap.
4333160	4334160	But anyway.

4342720	4343720	Alright.

4348320	4352840	weeks there's a whole other show I have with my buddy Extover all about the World of Warcraft
4352840	4358280	it's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth www.hordehouse.com and I promise you

4365880	4368240	Soccer on it so it's a great episode.
4368240	4369240	Yep.
4369240	4373440	I promise on this week's show there's going to be a shocking revelation that I'm going
4373440	4376160	to get tons of shit for.
4376160	4378560	It's going to be a hatin' on Rob episode.
4378560	4379560	Guess what?
4379560	4380560	What?
4380560	4384600	Also I was in my pajamas the entire time it was awesome.
4384600	4385600	Awesome.
4385600	4388320	So hordehouse.com if you want more information like that.
4388320	4392520	No I have not quit WoW and I have not resigned my account so get those thoughts out of your
4392520	4393520	head.
4393520	4396920	I always threaten to do it whenever Blizzard does something it pisses me off but I have
4396920	4399680	yet to so it's not that.
4399680	4404680	Alright anyhow let's get into some rapid fire news and then we'll get into the Twitter topics
4404680	4405680	after that.
4405680	4408680	Some quick stories that we want to throw at you although we don't have a whole lot of
4408680	4410080	time to discuss them.
4410080	4411080	Loki.
4411080	4412080	Ah yes.
4412080	4419200	No More Heroes Heroes Paradise is coming August 16th to North American regions.
4419200	4425160	It's basically the port of No More Heroes Red Zone that's coming out in Japan.
4425160	4429720	Basically No More Heroes HD graphics with the move support and also you can play it
4429720	4436140	non move as well with some additional bosses I guess from No More Heroes 2.
4436140	4441680	So that's pretty awesome if you want to check that out it's coming out August 16th on PlayStation
4441680	4443680	3.
4443680	4449700	Maybe a new Carmageddon being announced at E3 this year coming from Square Enix apparently
4449700	4458560	they have a countdown on the Carmageddon.com website and it is counting down to June 1st
4458560	4460520	so maybe an announcement.
4460520	4463660	It's so weird because when I think of Squeenix I don't think of Carmageddon I think of role
4463660	4467080	playing games and dudes with big hair but I keep forgetting oh yeah they have Eidos
4467080	4473800	now and that's where the Tomb Raider comes from and all that other stuff so it's interesting.
4473800	4478640	And then finally if you have a homebrew enabled PSP there's some pretty cool stuff you can
4478640	4486480	do with that including the PSP 3D plugin version 2.0 it's been released it enables 3D for select
4486480	4495360	PSP games and this is of course the old school cyan red glasses that you can wear and you
4495360	4501080	can actually play quite a few games in 3D they just added support for Crisis Core, God
4501080	4506120	Eater Burst, FIFA 11, and the third birthday.
4506120	4511480	And there's a pretty extensive list of games that actually are supported by Despicable
4511480	4521000	Me, Piscate, Ridge Racer 2, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Grip Shift, lots of big titles
4521000	4525360	Dead to the Right's Reckoning, Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron so a little bit of a mix of
4525360	4533280	everything including Eye of Judgment Legends still won't sell them all the copies.
4533280	4537160	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com Dungeon Buster says Carmageddon was so fun
4537160	4542320	and Amiga777 says Carmageddon was Eidos' baby no not necessarily it's just that when I think
4542320	4545520	of Squeenix I don't really think of Carmageddon I think of like role playing games and stuff
4545520	4548240	and I realize they've done some other stuff throughout their history that wasn't quite
4548240	4554200	like that but I just I don't know I think of the other stuff but then Eidos is you know
4554200	4559960	kind of the company that was a little more you know America developed games and UK developed
4559960	4565720	games and stuff and not so heavy on the Japanese influence until now these two companies have
4565720	4568560	come together so it's just interesting that's all.
4568560	4573620	Alright moving on speaking of Final Fantasy and Squeenix Final Fantasy Tactics is going
4573620	4579200	to be coming to the iPhone in late June mid-July and then it will be on the iPad after that
4579200	4583580	this of course is the PlayStation update if you will of Final Fantasy Tactics although
4583580	4589000	I don't know to be honest if the other Squeenix IOS games are anything to go by they really
4589000	4592840	have kind of souped up the games quite a bit so I don't think this is going to be just
4592840	4596560	a port it sounds like there'll be some extra stuff in this now what's interesting about
4596560	4600960	this the game was originally supposed to come out at Spring 2011 it was announced at last
4600960	4606100	year's E3 so here we are a year later and still no game so I don't know if that's just
4606100	4609680	they had a lot of paint to polish on it or maybe they decided to do more with it than
4609680	4614440	they had originally who knows but the iPad version of the game will come out a little
4614440	4619720	bit later than the iPhone version this is because of the higher resolution Square does
4619720	4624360	say one thing they are doing redoing some of the artwork for the higher resolution so
4624360	4628800	that's pretty awesome actually so take a look at that.
4628800	4634480	Alan Wake is apparently getting a new game on Xbox Live Arcade it's not quite what you
4634480	4639160	think it's not like a sequel or anything but it's a game called Alan Wake's Night Springs
4639160	4644080	this is a rumor right now it's nothing that's been confirmed but this makes a lot of sense
4644080	4649200	Alan Wake was a pretty awesome game but unfortunately came out at kind of a bad time and got really
4649200	4653460	overlooked by a lot of people but it has its fans so Xbox Live Arcade seems to be a good
4653460	4658760	place to kind of feel out maybe a real sequel but here's the deal Alan Wake's Night Springs
4658760	4665720	if you've played Alan Wake Night Springs is kind of the show within the show Alan Wake
4665720	4669560	really reminds me of Twin Peaks but as a video and when I say Twin Peaks like the old show
4669560	4673960	from 1990 with Kyle MacLachlan and David Lynch was the guy behind it right who killed Laura
4673960	4678140	Palmer Alan Wake kind of really reminds me of that a lot and Twin Peaks had a show within
4678140	4681560	a show it was called like Ticket to Love or something like that was like the soap opera
4681560	4684720	within the show that would explain some of the things that are actually going on well
4684720	4690520	Alan Wake has something just like that Night Springs so I guess that show within a game
4690520	4696720	is getting a spinoff that's kind of neat I guess so they have a show within a show it
4696720	4702320	is not Alan Wake 2 it is not more download content for the first game so whatever this
4702320	4709160	is it is something new so that's pretty cool coming from Capcom we've talked about Monster
4709160	4717120	Hunter on the PS3 but now Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting is coming to the iOS systems Capcom
4717120	4722080	did announce it for June Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting it's coming out for the iOS devices
4722080	4727500	a new intuitive control system it will not use the typical d-pad hooray because I hate
4727500	4731800	d-pad translations on the iPhone because there is no d-pad on the iPhone so that'll be kind
4731800	4736080	of cool you can use horizontal slashes and vertical slashes kind of a whole different
4736080	4741040	little way of doing it probably more information to come at E3 so there you go
4741040	4750600	well how about some Rock Band news too there's some Lady Gaga Rob on this new download content
4750600	4757680	pack is going to be Lady Gaga pack 02 Born This Way Love Game and Paparazzi and there's
4757680	4765120	also a couple of excuse me I need to burp on the mic there also will be a pro guitar
4765120	4770760	upgrade for Alice in Chains Roosters and the White Stripes Dead Leaves in the Dirty Ground
4770760	4779000	and two individual songs that are by Foreigner Hot-Blooded and Urgent so those are in there
4779000	4783760	and then there is Super Street Fighter IV I just I always love an excuse to be able
4783760	4797080	to play Lady Gaga on the show come on Dark Soccer sing along let's hear the voice don't
4797080	4805320	be afraid of your voice Dark Soccer you were born this way baby later I'm not drunk yet
4805320	4810240	Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition is going to be coming to Steam and they had some
4810240	4814840	issues with bringing it out for the PC but now it's going to be on Steam and it will
4814840	4821480	be 40 bucks there are pre-orders available too and there's not going to be though any
4821480	4826560	download content for Super Street Fighter Super Vanilla Street Fighter IV I should say
4826560	4830840	but the game will have a 10% discount on for the Super Arcade Edition bringing it down
4830840	4841680	to 36 bucks yay and the last of my batch of news is Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 has a release
4841680	4849000	date that's in Europe by the way it will be on July 1st so it's basically all the mobile
4849000	4854680	suits you have 50 playable and upgradeable characters 70 playable and upgradeable mecha
4854680	4860960	or the mobile suits I should say including the mobile suit Gundam 00 and mobile suit
4860960	4866640	Gundam you see you also have three new gameplay systems that are partner strike emergency
4866640	4876040	dash and recovery gauge so there you go gundam gundam so I hate to bring it back to Lady
4876040	4880240	Gaga no you don't know this is an important question it's very important and I apologize
4880240	4884020	to the haters out there as well but this is actually related to technology did you see
4884020	4888320	the commercial for Google Chrome with her in it I don't watch TV Rob no well it's on
4888320	4891840	the internets it's all over YouTube I'll look on YouTube then yeah you should check it out
4891840	4896400	because Google Chrome does great commercials like and if you're not like a Lady Gaga fan
4896400	4899840	then go look at the one for the it gets better the commercial they did for like Dan Savage
4899840	4903060	and it gets better and how that whole movement was done on the internet like they've like
4903060	4908480	compressed the feeling of that movement into like a minute and it's just like I mean I
4908480	4911800	get a little verklempt it's it's great and then there's another Google Chrome commercial
4911800	4917520	for I love how you're totally using Yiddish now I know talk amongst yourselves amongst
4917520	4924440	yourselves I'll give you a topic Lady Gaga neither Gaga nor a lady if certain rumors
4924440	4931160	are to be believed that was great all right but yeah no like the and there's a Google
4931160	4937300	Chrome commercial for it's like a guy who and you keep seeing the search box fill in
4937300	4943400	with these different terms like how to speak French plane ticket to Paris and it's like
4943400	4946760	the whole thing is about like a long-distance relationship and how Google like helps them
4946760	4955080	like what is a truffle it's really adorable and like oh my god Google Chrome is a good
4955080	4961040	you know what I used it I upgraded to Firefox 4 and my personal opinion is that it's absolute
4961040	4966040	and utter fucking shit like it is slowed down my computer certain websites work to fire
4966040	4972800	Instagram Firefox 4 is shit Firefox 4 hasn't done anything Firefox 3 is fine I was a huge
4972800	4977320	Firefox fan and supporter up until version 4 which is crap I have switched to Chrome
4977320	4982280	I will now never look back because I I did Chrome in the very beginning and I was like
4982280	4986360	this is kind of crap but now Chrome is great see none of my stuff none of my stuff's been
4986360	4991600	worked with the upgrade I still use my fire FTP I use everything but anyway well by the
4991600	4998060	way since we did talk about Lady Gaga's involvement do you know that George Takei has a video
4998060	5005000	out now oh the it's okay to be Takei it's okay to be Takei well that whole law in what
5005000	5016640	is it wherever but fuck place it is haha lol not anymore it's it's stupid but if you haven't
5016640	5021080	heard of this oh no no the commercials great no and I love George Takei oh my god I want
5021080	5024740	him to be when I'm old I want to be like George Takei I've decided that I want him to be my
5024740	5031480	gay daddy for real me too he should be all of our gay daddies I know and then whenever
5031480	5037680	we don't you want George Takei as your gay daddy no and then when we do something and
5037680	5043840	then when we're naughty he goes oh my you've been naughty oh god him and Betty White I
5043840	5051640	know any comedy don't George Takei and Betty White need a buddy yes they do oh my god that
5051640	5054960	would be I would be their opening day but you know what you know what I thought was
5054960	5060000	really hot and I hate that it was for such a bad thing but I totally squeaked and had
5060000	5065200	a fangirl moment what when he was doing the the thing asking for donations for the the
5065200	5069560	flooding in Japan and he was speaking Japanese and I was like I love listening to Japanese
5069560	5074960	spoken in a really hot voice mm-hmm and I was just like be my daddy and he really does
5074960	5082140	have just like a sexy voice especially considering his age he always has had God he has a voice
5082140	5089160	that could melt like he has a voice that can you hear his voice and your panties come off
5089160	5100080	right I'm getting a look I'm trying to think of what a super dense metal is it's hard to
5100080	5106960	melt because he could melt it he could make steam out of it anyway how do we get on this
5106960	5112120	subject oh yeah and that Kentucky law total bullshit come on but it's okay to be decay
5112120	5117120	I want the mug because a little Star Trek emblem on it all in rainbow I didn't even

5122400	5128520	be decay dot org or dot-com or something anyway we got on a tangent sorry about tangent rain
5128520	5132080	and look he's like I'm doing other stuff you know what though I am on to something with
5132080	5135640	the George Takei Betty White buddy comedy I mean I think a lot of our listeners would
5135640	5141160	see I mean it doesn't you know what I'm gonna go on Twitter right now and ask him would
5141160	5145600	you do a buddy comedy with Betty White you absolutely should I'm doing it because it's
5145600	5151640	it's you know it's okay to love George Takei cuz he was born this way whether gay straight
5151640	5158560	or bi lesbian transgender or I forget it don't forget about the asexual people to totally
5158560	5163080	miss my reference that's probably a good thing I know let's move on with the Twitter topics
5163080	5172000	for tonight twitter.com slash o l r tweet tweet tweet I'm actually being rude and I'm
5172000	5175760	like totally ignoring chat comments right now sorry chatters I was just I was really
5175760	5180360	into the whole George and Betty buddy comedy talk kaijuto in the chat room says George
5180360	5186720	and Betty should have a podcast absolutely they should let's see Tiger Claw says George
5186720	5190440	Takei may be best known for Star Trek but he made a contribution to Star Wars doing
5190440	5195020	a voice for an episode of the Clone Wars I didn't know that Bob Coffey says I wanted
5195020	5201440	powers to be that be to make that Sulu Excelsior series happen it would have been win I love
5201440	5205760	the George Takei is like involved with the Star Trek fandom the way he is like he just
5205760	5215000	gets it he's just awesome all right moving on Twitter topics doo doo doo doo doo doo
5215000	5219560	let's go to the first Twitter topic tonight this is from and I'm horribly gonna mispronounce
5219560	5225540	this name and I apologize I'm in advance but it's Ramaditya Knight senses his first tweet
5225540	5231840	it's me playing Scars of Time with my flute and we're linked to a youtubey and this better
5231840	5235840	not be a rickroll all right it's not phew all right let's see let's uh let's play a
5235840	5239160	little clip of this I want to see one of our listeners playing Scars of Time on the flute
5239160	5253360	let me fast forward a little bit here not bad now this is not like a sideways flute
5253360	5268680	it's like a pan flute no he's playing on the tin whistle it's very authentic yeah I don't
5268680	5274080	know what the setup is for this video it looks like there's like he's in a classroom or something
5274080	5279720	because there's some lady holding the mic there and this camera person is making me
5279720	5284080	dizzy they just turned the thing sideways very good I love that theme oh god that's
5284080	5288400	a great video game song like if you don't know Scars of Time you need to pause this
5288400	5293940	podcast and go on to YouTube and either look at this guy's rendition or go just find the
5293940	5306480	original song like ASAP anyhow moving on to some other tweets here from sj100 Matt I heard
5306480	5309360	about this earlier in the week too let's see what you guys think of this you know what
5309360	5315160	sucks up the most internet bandwidth in the US sorry did you hear this story let me have
5315160	5321520	you guess what do you think takes up the most internet bandwidth of anything look yeah I'm
5321520	5326600	assuming you heard this one okay so dark soccer since she didn't read it with all of the hype
5326600	5332640	I would say illegal downloads that's a really good guess actually probably what about that
5332640	5335680	what legal thing do you think takes up the most bandwidth like if there's one particular
5335680	5341120	site is eating up more bandwidth than anybody else who do you think it is YouTube good both
5341120	5347320	good guesses but actually the most bandwidth in the US is Netflix on video game consoles
5347320	5352280	right now huh yeah and it makes sense because you know Facebook is mostly text and pictures
5352280	5355560	yeah whereas Netflix you know it's kind of a trick question Facebook's probably getting
5355560	5360440	the most hits I was thinking YouTube but Netflix is HD movies right yeah so yeah it's a little
5360440	5365640	bit of a trick question but yeah sj100 Matt links us to an article about the Netflix is
5365640	5372840	the top user of bandwidth on the internet nearly 20% of peak hour downstream traffic
5372840	5378800	in North America is used for streaming video over Netflix through a home video game console
5378800	5383560	representing the most usage of any source that's a testament to how fast this whole
5383560	5388080	technology in the game console stuff picked on and you know game consoles are selling
5388080	5393400	for the mere fact that you can use them as instant Netflix boxes don't don't lie to yourself
5393400	5398520	that this isn't a selling point for a lot of 360s and PlayStations and wheeze of excuse
5398520	5404240	me hiccups are killer and wheeze of the world you know Nintendo really had to get on with
5404240	5410400	Netflix with the whole Wii and I'm sure their next console will be on it as well so the
5410400	5415840	three game consoles that support Netflix the Wii Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 accounted for
5415840	5421400	the majority of that usage when combined consoles accounted for sixty six point three percent
5421400	5429480	of the figure or nineteen point seven percent of overall downstream usage that's crazy there
5429480	5435320	you go and no amiga it's not porn that is taking up the most bandwidth that's a really
5435320	5441540	good guess though let's see moving on to some other tweets DJ Rama S tweets us and says
5441540	5449600	hey if you go to www.freeplayday.com you can get a free ten dollar play at Dave and Busters
5449600	5454760	boy I just I just did a total commercial for some website if that wasn't Rama S and I knew
5454760	5457680	he's like a legitimate person I would have thought that was you know what I've gotten
5457680	5461760	like five ten dollar off coupons from Dave and Busters just by being in their little
5461760	5467120	club thing so they they throw it out because they know you're gonna spend their money now
5467120	5471120	I'm gonna tell you my fucking bitch about Dave and Busters and this pisses me off pisses
5471120	5475520	me off I've been a member of Dave and Busters my little card there ever since I started
5475520	5479080	playing DDR and went to the Milpitas Great Mall for the first time literally ten years
5479080	5483640	ago literally ten years ago maybe nine was the first time I ever went to a Dave and Busters
5483640	5489860	and I've had the same card same card ever since then and it has given me problems when
5489860	5493800	I went to Times Square once I went to an OLR lunch with some of the OLR listeners like
5493800	5498400	Zaku Rama some people you've heard call into the show before went to lunch with them and
5498400	5503460	some others and they saw my card get borked by the system because I didn't roam it so
5503460	5507520	I had to get it saved and then it happened when I came back so long story short I've
5507520	5511520	used the same card for ten years now Dave and Busters has this program where once you
5511520	5517060	spend a certain amount of chips you go gold I went gold without ever having a Dave and
5517060	5521840	Busters in Roseville finally just about like three months ago now the Dave Busters is in
5521840	5528480	Roseville so I go gold and what happens they discontinue the program one month later you
5528480	5533840	find this out on my birthday I found this out on Dark Soccer's birthday when I was like
5533840	5538160	oh can I get because my card once again borked because I used it at a different Dave and
5538160	5542360	Busters well they fix it so you know good on their customer service they always fix
5542360	5545760	the issue so fine you know I'm not mad at them for that I'm mad that they got rid of
5545760	5548280	the gold program because now it's like oh well we have this new thing now where you
5548280	5554000	get the coupons it's like I don't want to go on Wednesday night wah yeah this is serious
5554000	5559080	business that used to be mine and Dan's date night until I had classes on Wednesday no
5559080	5562320	I'll take Dan Dan and I can have date night at Dave and Busters but I don't have classes
5562320	5565680	on Wednesday night anymore okay so I have to get up at 8 30 in the freaking morning
5565680	5571280	on Monday and Wednesday to go to astronomy which I don't need astronomy but uh don't
5571280	5577760	get me started you don't want to go look at the planets I have no need for astronomy as
5577760	5582560	what's your major graphic design and I'll already have I have my to know how to draw
5582560	5590880	lines my degree will be here in like a few weeks I am officially a graduate uh I saw
5590880	5596920	a letter seven degrees saying sorry you need some astronomy all right let me go to a couple
5596920	5601680	tweets from Tiger Claw Tiger Claw is funny because uh he tweeted us a couple things I'm
5601680	5605000	like dude you tweeted us stuff that's gonna come up later in the show so he tweeted like
5605000	5610160	seven things but you only get two Tiger Claw but I'll read these these are the ones that
5610160	5615840	caught my eye harmonix is announcing a new game at e3 we'll file this between done of
5615840	5620600	course but I mean it's official harmonix is going to announce something new at e3 what
5620600	5625400	does go between done of course Dance Central 2 apparently is going to go between those
5625400	5630920	two uh I'm wondering if there is actually like something else with this as well they
5630920	5636480	have said it is not Rock Band 4 that is confirmed uh and apparently uh there was an interview
5636480	5641540	with Game Informer saying quote rest assured that harmonix is still developing new ideas
5641540	5645840	and concepts to advance the Rock Band franchise and we look forward to sharing them when the
5645840	5649760	time is right I don't think harmonix is all about Dance Central necessarily I think there'll
5649760	5655960	be something new from them I kind of hope it's a dj oh god I hope it's a dj game too
5655960	5661400	I I really I think they should be awesome if Konami refuses then you know what when
5661400	5665320	they fall asleep at the wheel as they always have with their series that could do great
5665320	5672960	here uh then you know what let harmonix do it better for real uh one other one I'm gonna
5672960	5678220	read here uh Ellie Noire we were talking about earlier in the show it is banned if you live
5678220	5684000	in the UAE so uh yep there it is United Arab Emirates uh the game magazine there the retail
5684000	5689440	I'm sorry the retail chain geekay geekay games I keep reading it as geeky games uh updated
5689440	5694660	their Facebook saying LA Noire has been banned yep the UAE the United Arab Emirates their
5694660	5698560	national media council they didn't say why they've banned the game but they've banned
5698560	5706280	it it probably has something to do with dead woman beaver I'm just taking a speculation
5706280	5711240	just guessing dead animals are nothing to you know dead animals are nothing to ban a
5711240	5720560	video game about is it Winona's brown beaver I don't think her name's Winona uh anyhow
5720560	5723120	maybe it is I don't know I haven't played LA Noire yet alright that does it for twitter
5723120	5727440	topics twitter.com slash olr if you want to send your shit early for next week let's move
5727440	5736160	on I just outed myself as a primus fan moving on Loki let's get into some other news yes
5736160	5746880	um so this is kind of I don't know typical of certain companies uh Zynga once again has
5746880	5754280	another lawsuit on their hands thanks to their game frontierville which has kind of borrowed
5754280	5762080	like some ideas from certain games like Oregon Trail in fact on May 30th they they're planning
5762080	5769060	to launch the Oregon Trail expansion pack uh which basically allows you to go along
5769060	5778960	the Oregon Trail hunt um you know fording rivers etc um and of course the learning company
5778960	5784120	the people that hold the rights to the Oregon Trail they're none too happy about the fact
5784120	5792120	that Zynga's basically ripping off of their game and uh you know even calling it you know
5792120	5797840	the Oregon Trail expansion I mean granted yes the Oregon Trail is a real thing but it's
5797840	5804400	also very very very very similar to the Oregon Trail game usually I would go off on a tangent
5804400	5808660	right now about frivolous lawsuits etc etc but you know it's Zynga and I'm just kind
5808660	5813240	of like eh let him I watch the trailer and that damn thing is you know if not a really
5813240	5818880	lame version of the Oregon Trail that you would see on Facebook it is basically everything
5818880	5822280	that's part of the Oregon Trail yeah I realize the Oregon Trail is like a historic thing
5822280	5828560	but the other tricky thing about it is that Oregon Trail is actually on Facebook as a
5828560	5836800	game right now so uh Black Wolf in our chat room says unpopular opinion the actual trail
5836800	5840640	was called the Oregon Trail I doubt they have the rights to everything related to that historical
5840640	5846240	event uh no it's not as unpopular opinion it's true it's just I don't know like I just
5846240	5850880	I can't like there's so many other game companies that need to be advocated for that I don't
5850880	5858000	feel the need to save Zynga right now you know what I mean like sorry I want to look
5858000	5862880	at this trail or how'd it do hopefully I don't get sued because I said trail I want to look
5862880	5868080	at this trailer real fast here it's time to load up your connoisseur wagon and set off
5868080	5873120	on the whole down trail all you need is a few of your closest friends to join up as
5873120	5880000	your crew you'll need a hunter to rustle up vittles and a carpenter for fixing the wagon
5880000	5885680	and such like and a doctor in case folks come down with the rocky mountain scoots you can
5885680	5890540	leave messages and fancy presents for your friends so they'll want to visit your expedition
5890540	5895120	every day okay I gotta be honest this really does look like the Facebook game the Oregon
5895120	5898560	Trail Facebook game like especially with the hunting thing and the whole fact how you invite
5898560	5905280	your friends to go on the trail with you like I I think um they have a point actually I
5905280	5912160	I really can't help Zynga on this one actually sorry I'm sorry seeing video of any Zynga
5912160	5918680	game being played makes me hate Facebook like I have hatred of Facebook you know thanks
5918680	5924300	to Zynga it's like invite your friends I fucking hate when people invite me to shit you know
5924300	5932020	what I do with people that invite me to shit I ignore it and perhaps block you from sending
5932020	5939560	me invites for shit I will not play Facebook games period except for the one time I played
5939560	5944300	Chuck Stucks to get the trick you guys would be impressed I didn't even play Gagaville
5944300	5955660	I didn't play it I'm sorry okay you know she here we go hold out revving the motor she's
5955660	5960860	sold out I mean come on you're teaming up with you know Zynga for shit I don't give
5960860	5966100	a shit if they donated money to you know some stupid you know to the tsunami stuff but they
5966100	5972020	donated it through you or you donate it through them big deal you know what I just think it's
5972020	5978740	retarded that you're granted it's smart to market yourself as unicorns Rob I think I
5978740	5983620	know but I'm not gonna play it I am not gonna play it and look you hit the nail on the head
5983620	5987020	it was smart because it's going after the target audience and I don't mean to sound
5987020	5993460	like a sexist but it's a bunch of women playing Farmville and that's goo gaga a lot of Gaga's
5993460	6000340	music appeals to most of most not all most of the Gaga haters are straight men like it's
6000340	6006560	just I did however fine don't get me wrong screen capture Madonna back in the day did
6006560	6011980	some really weird shit okay she was really weird she sold her soul to Pepsi and then
6011980	6016500	they just they just fucked her over after that whole like a prayer thing but Gaga is
6016500	6023260	like you know Madonna to 11 it's just seriously she's fucking no she is she's actually more
6023260	6027540	more like Marilyn Manson than she is Madonna she's just fucking crazy and you know what
6027540	6032260	happened to Marilyn Manson people stop caring and that's what's gonna happen the Lady Gaga's
6032260	6035980	people are gonna stop fucking caring because you know what I gotta admit her I'll never
6035980	6042660	stop I love her her early music was okay but each song comes out after that I care less
6042660	6051960	and less about like she starts making up stuff now yeah anybody can use spout out non words
6051960	6058460	you know in a song I mean that that's easy to do but it's just I don't get it like for
6058460	6063780	example born this way totally sounds like an anthem you know a gay anthem or something
6063780	6069620	like that that she you know crafted on purpose so that it gets played in gay clubs make sure
6069620	6074660	that she has you know the gay demographic you know that's all it is it's seriously it's
6074660	6082540	just figuring out how to you know achieve you know the most listeners now I did find
6082540	6087440	actually one interesting marketing thing that she did where they were giving away a can
6087440	6092580	of monster fuel now I have to ask this since you talk about how like Gaga's music gets
6092580	6096100	weirder and weirder and I really hope I don't get screwed by clicking on random YouTube
6096100	6102500	links but have you heard that Lady Gaga has a new song on her album called Shiza which
6102500	6108540	is German for shit so she literally has a song called shit on her new album let me play
6108540	6124180	a little bit for you now that isn't weird at all except like it wait wait wait keep
6124180	6138700	playing that for a second there it sounded like another Loki made me play Gaga you guys
6138700	6144860	he made me you know what whoever whoever did this thing should have used the the shit instead
6144860	6150860	of the instead of the B yeah no I was that's a yeah I'm serious if that picture right there
6150860	6155740	doesn't make her look like a Satan blow-up doll I don't know what you know what to say
6155740	6161460	I mean she was like she was on American Idol the other week as a mentor which is just like
6161460	6167500	okay whatever you mad no I'm not mad I'm just like I just rolled my eyes it's like she's
6167500	6174140	like okay oh it's my time on camera I'm gonna say something crazy crazy and it's like you
6174140	6180900	know there's okay that wasn't really helpful at all but thanks you know I don't know what
6180900	6185380	the hell she was wearing but it was something retarded it's like I'm not gonna stand for
6185380	6193180	such Gaga hating on this program roll she's a genius oh she's a saint please she a genius
6193180	6198660	she's a genius she's an absolute look we're talking about her on a fucking video game

6204660	6210940	take offense to that I'm sorry you know I fucking knew this was gonna happen this is
6210940	6216420	a fucking mistake revoke his Mensa membership immediately no seriously she's not a fucking
6216420	6221540	genius she's good at marketing okay you know what there are people that are in the magazine
6221540	6226940	business that are good at marketing Steve Jobs is good at marketing but he's not fucking
6226940	6233140	well okay he is fucking crazy but he's not fucking quick overtly fucking crazy you know
6233140	6237820	I whatever you know what she's a fad she'll go away it's what's gonna happen Donna never

6267380	6272740	seen her couch all right it looks like she wearing it on her face because I swear to
6272740	6278860	God you know sometimes I wonder that she's just relocated her vagina to her face I mean

6283540	6288780	what I want Zinga there you go I bet you anything that's going to be the next album cover is

6304220	6307300	night's Saturday Night Live performance because she was on Saturday Night Live and she did
6307300	6312740	Born This Way her song and what she did during the performance she actually got pregnant
6312740	6318980	and gave birth live on stage to a bunch of glitter during the performance it was an art
6318980	6325220	piece and it was brilliant it was brilliant I was moved if that's an art by the way and
6325220	6329880	when this is the last of the Gaga for me you know what she did to everybody who's coming
6329880	6336180	out in line she bought them dinner and donuts and coffee and signed autographs and took
6336180	6341580	pictures with people waiting in line yeah because she genuinely likes her fans well
6341580	6345900	I'm glad that she genuinely likes her fans but you know what I'm sorry that still doesn't
6345900	6352340	make you a fucking whore and you know and if you if you call what that she did on stage
6352340	6357140	art then I'm sorry a peep show is fucking art then and you know what there's more peep
6357140	6361700	shows out there than there are Gaga so I guess we have that to be thankful I don't I don't
6361700	6365780	hate on peep shows that's one thing you'll never hear me ranting about on this program
6365780	6372160	Loki I would never touch your sacred pornography collection I would never there's nothing sacred
6372160	6381260	about that all right whatever I'm done can we get back to video games let's all right
6381260	6385700	this is very important look we need to go from Lady Gaga talking about very important
6385700	6395540	video game news such as this cat food maker friskies has released I point iPad and Android
6395540	6405780	games for your cat this is why we have to talk about tasty treasures party mix-up and
6405780	6413780	catfishing iPad games for your cat an iPad pussy play with you okay you know I watched
6413780	6419060	a little video and it is super adorable I would get this for Shermy if I had an iPad
6419060	6427860	and she didn't have pause oh my god this looks so cute your little pet can touch the food
6427860	6434460	and it splits up that actually is really cute there's the fishy one is great that's tasty
6434460	6440820	treasures on here all it is is random shit flying on the screen and the cat just goes
6440820	6445780	meow meow meow meow meow it's like like it's playing whack-a-mole and they they they burst
6445780	6454380	this is it catfishing which is like the little koi app on the iPhone now salacious pop my
6454380	6459260	significant other in chat room says I am NOT buying maruko our cat an iPad fuck that and
6459260	6462820	to that I'm saying no no no you're not buying maruko an iPad you're buying me an iPad and
6462820	6470660	maybe I'll let your cat play with it my birthday is June 26 just saying it's okay I'm getting
6470660	6476740	you a TK mug no but all seriousness what do you think I mean there's a lot to laugh at
6476740	6480920	here when you're talking about kitties playing games on the iPad but at the same time it's
6480920	6485480	oddly fucking fascinating that like we are now to the point where we're making video
6485480	6492300	games for the cats they're free right um I would hope so because they're kind of commercial
6492300	6498760	games let's see the games do keep score and your cats can compete to see you as the best
6498760	6503700	reaction don't give a shit boy oh boy my cat gives a shit all over the floor actually I'm
6503700	6510700	not sure if they're free or not I can't see they can't they can't be more than a dollar
6510700	6515260	I'm sure they're not more than they're probably free because given the simplicity of the games
6515260	6520220	are probably free see look sure me is not sleeping anymore she's looking up and listening
6520220	6525100	that's right sure means like fuck yeah mommy I want that well mommy wants an iPad baby
6525100	6529780	so you have to wait tell daddy that she only wants an iPad so she can shit on it that's
6529780	6534380	what your cat will do no your cat will be like what's this game sure me do you just
6534380	6541220	want to shit on everything if I could show you a picture sometimes this is terrible radio
6541220	6545260	but the cat is like smelling the microphone going what is this it smells like mommy it
6545260	6549580	smells like mommy's spaghetti because mommy had spaghetti tiger claw in our chat room
6549580	6558380	asks how long till they make games for dogs or ferrets um Byron D0 said something even
6558380	6562940	funnier what's that Rorschach and Deadpool because they played the same music that they
6562940	6571420	played in part of that slashes pop in our chat room says this is a game for people who
6571420	6577340	make their cats real Facebook pages and then comment with meow meow on their IRL profile
6577340	6582620	with coworkers and shit on them oh my god those are the people that creep me the crap
6582620	6589620	out on Facebook when they do that for their pets and their babies your baby can't speak
6589620	6595420	and if your baby can speak it's not anything intelligible by most people your baby doesn't
6595420	6598900	need a Facebook your cat doesn't need a Facebook your dog doesn't need a Facebook your children
6598900	6603660	probably even if they're up to seven years old don't need a Facebook maybe the baby hit
6603660	6609980	random buttons and autocorrect things everything he's got a point you know what these iPad
6609980	6613300	games I bet would be really good for babies to have proven though that a two-year-old
6613300	6617780	can operate an iPhone oh I'm sure text and make calls I brought you know what not to
6617780	6621300	make myself sound like you or whatever I probably could have when I was younger I had a Commodore
6621300	6626620	64 when I was five and I knew what I was doing with it I mean for the most part I was typing
6626620	6630080	up stuff from the back of the book like that was me programming was typing programs in
6630080	6636860	from the back of the book but you know right anyhow let's move on with some more stories
6636860	6641820	enough about kitty iPad games let's talk about one of dark soccer favorite games dark
6641820	6649500	soccer well I'm actually still on the German alphabet website portal portal to offended
6649500	6657740	people and you know who the people who defended the adopted because of all the cracks that
6657740	6662900	glad us makes the game about the character being adopted and of course I like it in the
6662900	6668940	end when Wheatley's doing goes fatty adopted fatty it's like like you are adopted and that's
6668940	6678740	terrible but yeah is basically this dude named Neil's staple was playing portal to and he's
6678740	6689660	adopted father to Zoe a Chinese orphan and got pissed off when the when glad us was going
6689660	6698360	off on cell for being adopted of course also overweight people and idiots are offended
6698360	6705860	to because they also talk about all that and probably trash is insulted and probably turrets
6705860	6720180	so yeah it's it's the the the adopter who was insulted not the adoptee again oh wait
6720180	6725460	we have local news story on this that we can play oh my god I love these I love when local
6725460	6729880	news media like completely misrepresent video games is gonna be amazing okay I'm gonna play
6729880	6747460	this ready and if we're lucky maybe somehow Loki can turn this into Lady Gaga chat actually
6747460	6751740	the quality of this is rather shit and it's really quiet so I don't know if I should really
6751740	6757400	play the whole thing because it's not really coming through so maybe I won't do that well
6757400	6762300	let me see if I can crank it up some other way hold on one sec guys live radio is tons
6762300	6767660	of fun no I have wave up as high as they'll go it's I can't get that any louder what a
6767660	6774500	shit little play some of it no it's too quiet they can't hear it let me um let me go to
6774500	6784020	YouTube see if I can find it real quick uh WBTV portal to find portal to being adopted
6784020	6789180	yeah I'm gonna see if this works better administration we have discovered a popular video game making
6789180	6795860	fun of adoption and tonight a father is shocked at the insensitivity he says he witnessed
6795860	6806180	here's the clip what's wrong with being adopted that's not well um lack of parents the game
6806180	6810740	is called portal 2 and it's only been available for about a month we get him back just to
6810740	6815460	talk to the father who's shared this who saw this with his daughter yeah I bet he was shocked
6815460	6820020	and really surprised by something like yeah no idea particularly because this is a game
6820020	6825220	that builds itself as educational it's rated e for everyone as we said neil staple was
6825220	6829860	playing the game with his 10 year old adopted daughter when they saw the clip tonight he
6829860	6835500	says he and his wife are still searching for a way to try to explain it I didn't know what
6835500	6839820	to do I still don't know what to do neil staples still can't believe what he heard while playing
6839820	6850500	the video game portal 2 with his 10 year old adopted daughter Zoe they really do make this
6850500	6854360	look pretty terrible I got to admit but like I feel like this like really taken out of
6854360	6860060	context you know it is it's like you have to remember they're taunting they're taunting
6860060	6864420	everything about her you know no matter what it is and to be honest I don't think they
6864420	6869180	ever really proved that she's adopted no so I don't know like I just kind of feel like
6869180	6873540	this is really selective hearing that's that's my biggest issue what's going on here but
6873540	6879240	like I watch this news report and I go wow this game's fucking rude but I've played through
6879240	6885300	the game and I didn't get that impression at all it is it's e 10 plus it's not a baseline
6885300	6891320	e for everyone oh so in other words the 10 year old daughter since she's not 10 plus
6891320	6896540	she's 10 probably should have been watching well it's 10 and over it's not over 10 god
6896540	6900420	damn you low you always got to fucking disagree with me did you hear that the character in
6900420	6907860	the popular kids video game is actually taunted for being adopted it literally pokes fun for
6907860	6912100	not having parents wow and you literally proved that you're an idiot have never hidden the
6912100	6917440	fact Zoe is adopted she's Chinese she obviously doesn't look like us they wanted to wait until
6917440	6923980	she was ready to talk about it froze the question the most ultimate question that that child
6923980	6930660	is ever going to have for you and it just throws her right in the living room I needed
6930660	6936740	really gonna cry I really needed attention um that's why I contacted the news because
6936740	6942460	I needed attention because I'm an idiot hold on but he heard immediately cut the game off
6942460	6948540	hoping Zoe hadn't heard the cruel joke from a video game build is educational and appropriate
6948540	6954300	for everyone 10 and up and it says rated e for everybody and I was thinking maybe it's
6954300	6958700	rated e for everybody except for orphans if you're not an adoptive parent it's probably
6958700	6964100	not that big a deal to you if you are an adoptive parent it was literally the worst thing I
6964100	6969300	could possibly have heard but did Zoe hear it she's sticking to her guns that she didn't
6969300	6973100	hear it and to me that message means she's not ready to talk about it and I'm not gonna
6973100	6980500	force it oh my god eyes rolling too much Neil says they steer clear of that part of the
6980500	6986180	game and hope their daughter never feels like she's any less because she's adopted I can't
6986180	6993300	imagine my life without her I mean she's just such an awesome child she's just made our
6993300	6998320	lives so much better okay now again we did say this game was now surely there'll be a
6998320	7002540	counterpoint to this right like surely they tried to reach out to valve for comment right
7002540	7006100	hey you know and it's because you have to sort of figure out a way to get out of every
7006100	7012060	single room we did contact Sony who distributes the game they told us to contact valve the
7012060	7016900	company that actually created the game I did we have not heard back from them passing the
7016900	7023660	buck onto somebody certainly seems oh oh that is so not the way it works Sony doesn't distribute
7023660	7028980	the game it's EA that distributes the game idiot god you're funny send me the link to
7028980	7034140	that place because I'm going to type one hell of a rebuttal well you know what since they
7034140	7041820	didn't respond back to our claim they're wrong having interned in local news as long as I
7041820	7048020	did I mean I know this means a lot but by trying to contact them they probably gave
7048020	7053300	a couple hours tops this was all done within a day most disabled comments most stories
7053300	7057260	you do are done or most stories you see on the news are done in a day unless it's like
7057260	7061460	for sweeps or something it's it's all done start to finish in a day so valve didn't get
7061460	7067020	back to this lady within the same day it didn't make the news and it's not going to so I think
7067020	7071500	it's kind of screwed up that they didn't really show both sides of it but I got to admit I
7071500	7078220	will I mean you might unpopular opinion okay everybody that piece and I agree portal looks
7078220	7086300	pretty fucked up the website is WB TV dot-com email them all email them please email them
7086300	7091260	I think honestly the part that they kind of leave out that kind of irritates me is that
7091260	7094100	if you're going to play that game with your kid you kind of have to be able to explain
7094100	7100060	it all to them and you have to explain that these characters will mock anything to try
7100060	7104540	that's what glad us does she mocks everything what's next is somebody going to be upset
7104540	7111500	because the game called them fat I don't know it's just a little silly and it's a character
7111500	7117940	it's a narrative it's not hey you person playing the game you adopted well you're stupid you're
7117940	7126300	adopted your parents loser adopted loser and you're fat parents would have had abortion
7126300	7130940	but they couldn't so they had you and gave you away you really sound a lot worse than
7130940	7137900	it treated you for for a burger burgers are more desirable than you fatty prey eat tons
7137900	7148700	of burgers can we move on new story please well I actually am going to email them well
7148700	7159220	that was my story so bogey I yes so when I'm not complaining about that kind of stuff Ubisoft
7159220	7164780	you know they're looking at maybe taking the next step with some of their franchises instead
7164780	7170060	of leaving in the hands of people that may not be able to do their franchise as well
7170060	7175940	in the motion picture world they're going to go ahead and form Ubisoft motion pictures
7175940	7180780	they're going to adapt some of their biggest properties Assassin's Creed Splinter Cell
7180780	7188540	and Ghost Recon into 3d features I'm very disappointed though that rabbits were not
7188540	7192980	part of that because honestly I think that would work much better as a 3d animated feature
7192980	7199660	than you know some of this stuff but whatever they said in addition to the trio of future
7199660	7205100	projects the studio is reportedly developing 3d CGI animated series oh they are based on
7205100	7213140	the rabbit's properties awesome so the comprised of 78 episodes seven minutes apiece it's almost
7213140	7219020	like their little trailers that they have that's awesome but seriously though they should
7219020	7224540	they should get their own full-length theater or a theatrical movie couldn't be any worse
7224540	7231480	than some of the other stuff I've seen yeah all right let's see one other actually two
7231480	7235820	other quick e3 related stories hello Konami and I think this is brought up earlier in
7235820	7239100	the show but let's just throw it out there they are going to be doing their e3 press
7239100	7243340	conference a little bit early this year they're going to be doing their press conference I
7243340	7257980	believe it is the Sunday beforehand let's see it is on pre e3 show 2011 and it is happening
7257980	7263060	is there really a press release that doesn't have the fucking time of the event in here
7263060	7267460	Konami today announced the venue picks for the company's first animal annual global pre
7267460	7276500	e3 e3 show 2011 at the Times listed below and they never say what day it is I'm pretty
7276500	7280280	sure it's Sunday but that's amazing that the press release doesn't actually say what day
7280280	7285020	it is oh no there it is the live events taking place June 2nd thank you who it said once
7285020	7291720	all right so June 2nd that is a Thursday Thursday oh that's really early all right so they're
7291720	7296180	going to be doing their press conference on the Thursday beforehand give bloggers and
7296180	7300420	people will chance talk about it and you can attend live if you want they're going to actually
7300420	7307620	be renting places in Los Angeles San Francisco Toronto Sao Paulo Mexico City so they're getting
7307620	7311980	international with this see now my only thing about this though is they said it's like live
7311980	7315340	viewing parties now they just watching the press conference are they actually going to
7315340	7319420	be able to play games there and stuff I don't know they they aren't really saying it makes
7319420	7325020	it sound like they're just going to be able to watch like you'll just get to be able to
7325020	7331760	watch this and you can register online for a chance to attend with the place here in
7331760	7335220	San Francisco they're going to be doing at his temple nightclub I'm not familiar with
7335220	7339140	that place but I imagine it's at four o'clock it's kind of early but they probably have
7339140	7343540	to pick a time like that because four o'clock would be seven o'clock on the East Coast and
7343540	7350180	what time would that be in Japan it would be 8 a.m. the next day I think so maybe that's
7350180	7355460	why they're doing it at that time I don't know but yeah they're doing a pre-3 show 2011
7355460	7359500	and talking about these venues they picked so facebook.com slash Konami if you want to
7359500	7367340	go to the viewing event or you can just watch it online interesting anyhow Microsoft's E3
7367340	7373220	briefing will be very easy to watch you can just turn on Spike TV and it'll be on Spike
7373220	7380180	TV is announced they will air an Xbox 360 centric show 1230 p.m. Pacific time Monday
7380180	7385700	June 6th no it's weird is normally that is reserved for g4 yeah it is a little weird
7385700	7391900	because g4 don't they have the exclusive e3 like pass or whatever usually they do for
7391900	7397180	um I know they've done um Microsoft's conference in the past technically though the press conferences
7397180	7404860	are a part of e3 so that's why yeah I probably pay money for it so interesting so everybody's
7404860	7408340	gonna be able to watch that live as long as you have basic cable otherwise I'm sure it'll
7408340	7415500	be streamed over Justin TV everywhere so check that out all right let with that let's go
7415500	7420380	to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com
7420380	7425100	is the place to send your emails and dark soccer is going to dive in the mailbag head
7425100	7431620	first and find some emails to read for us today first email greetings olr is your friendly
7431620	7435420	neighborhood turtle I have no game related comments or questions this week I just wanted
7435420	7440360	to send hearts your way and say that olr is the best and only gaming podcast that I currently
7440360	7445100	listen to and whoever is responsible for putting the podcast up on the internet says doing
7445100	7449940	an awesome job Oh Rob thank you because every Monday I wake up for work and see that your
7449940	7455440	show is available for download it makes my Mondays so much better thank you all so much
7455440	7458900	for all the time and effort you put into the show each week your loyal turtle in Philly
7458900	7462840	serious turtle I literally don't allow myself to do anything else Sunday nights until the
7462840	7467780	show is posted plus the other thing that made it a lot easier I changed the way I write
7467780	7472300	descriptions so I don't actually have to think of a sassy like commentary on what happened
7472300	7475460	during the show I just basically post like the first five stories from the show roll
7475460	7480700	and then that's it cuz I who's reading the descriptions like not our subscribers I don't
7480700	7484520	think they really read the description I mean I could be wrong but I just in the interest
7484520	7490020	of getting it up faster I just and we don't edit the show either I mean I have to edit
7490020	7494700	it to take out the middle part where we play copyright music and just clean up the beginning
7494700	7498240	and end but as for like the actual content in the middle it's live radio we don't really
7498240	7504220	edit like something has to go really really wrong or somebody has to say something really
7504220	7509580	really bad for us to edit and I don't remember I ease I haven't edited any content out and
7509580	7517160	easily a year at least so well I guess this doesn't really apply to you anymore Rob since
7517160	7523180	I know you've got the trial but Holly D sent an invite and said any of us can use it to
7523180	7529900	play rift oh she's been pimping out on a horde house on the forums over there she's desperate
7529900	7536860	to get her corgi and the other little rewards that she can get so well that's there maybe
7536860	7542980	maybe I'll look at it but I really can't I have no time were you liking rift I'm gonna
7542980	7549600	plead the fifth until later all right anyway we gotta say without a without a doubt though
7549600	7557260	that it is better than Final Fantasy 14 absolutely okay I was still in writing my angry email
7557260	7562420	to WBTV sorry anyway then we have another one from Holly hi all I was listening to your
7562420	7566340	latest podcast about tons of people turning in their ps3s you guys said multiple times
7566340	7570060	that you thought it was fickle personally I think it's about people making a statement
7570060	7573500	to the company that this sort of thing is not acceptable it's not that they don't want
7573500	7578060	to play the games it's not that they were hacked it says Sony was adequately protected
7578060	7582160	inadequately protected their information new in advance of the protection it was inadequate
7582160	7586020	taunted hackers got hacked and then covered it up for three weeks that's not a company
7586020	7591440	I want to give my money to that's but you gotta admit there's a ton of people doing
7591440	7595980	it out of being purely fickle there's a lot of people there's just that's how people are
7595980	7602100	I can understand it for every you know one person who's got true authentic integrity
7602100	7609660	and turning it in there's gonna be 25 other that are gonna just be telling me seriously
7609660	7614280	I mean okay to continue I mean it's all can I say this real quick though you're you're
7614280	7619580	only following the here's where the line is between fickle and yeah I meant it is when
7619580	7625220	a game like The Last Guardian comes out are you gonna rebuy a ps3 if you sold yours back
7625220	7629580	you know is there gonna be like if you mean it and you stick to your guns then you know
7629580	7633700	what you have every right it's your money you should let you spend it on what you want
7633700	7638380	we only think your fickle when it's you know I'm selling it back but I'm just gonna buy
7638380	7642900	one again three months later when I forget that it happened because there's a game that's
7642900	7650540	out that I really want but some people never forget it's understandable to continue yes
7650540	7654080	I mean it's good that only credit cards are stolen that people finally know but the way
7654080	7658180	Sony waited to tell everyone to cancel their cards is just unacceptable I really think
7658180	7662660	that people dumping their ps3 is really then telling the company that this crosses a line
7662660	7667000	people who dump a console or a game over principle they hold dear are really not being fickle
7667000	7670420	they just feel the statement they need to make is more important I stopped playing well
7670420	7674260	because of something Blizzard did that I find unacceptable it doesn't matter that I like
7674260	7677980	the game I'm not going to put money into a company that treats its customers badly and
7677980	7683060	I really feel this is why people are abandoning ship on Sony holiday like I said I think that
7683060	7689760	for every one person that's got a legitimate reason with actual integrity behind it the
7689760	7696220	rest of them are shaping you know and I would fully admit there's been times I really would
7696220	7700180	want to leave Blizzard but I kind of feel like I'd be being one of those fickle people
7700180	7703780	like I just go right back six months later when that patch comes out that I really want
7703780	7710020	to play so I don't know it's tough when you stick to your guns that's pretty admirable
7710020	7715340	yeah it's kind of like being vegetarian or vegan no don't let's go further people who
7715340	7720920	actually like stay vegan for years and years is Gaga vegan no I don't I don't know if she
7720920	7726140	no she wore a dress made out of meat so she wore meat doesn't mean she eats meat I don't
7726140	7734300	think people who are vegan either do it for severe health reasons or for animals and no
7734300	7740380	I'm not don't hear me wrong I'm not knocking vegans but there are some people who like
7740380	7743540	do it for a couple weeks and they're like this is too hard I gotta go back to eating
7743540	7751580	chicken you know so I don't know I think I personally I've tried to go vegetarian I can't
7751580	7757140	do it I can't even go vegetarian it's too hard I didn't get enough protein I know how
7757140	7761260	to get protein I just still wasn't getting enough of it anyway I don't know when I just
7761260	7767300	started comparing like Blizzard of being a vegetarian but okay next email hello guys
7767300	7771220	first of all congratulations on your awesome show I listen to it at work and it makes my
7771220	7776220	hours go by faster I would like your opinion on these two topics one games with poor and
7776220	7782900	are no control configuration options yeah that sucks and games that don't allow you
7782900	7789100	to pause the cutscenes thank you and good luck with your show and that's from I'll just
7789100	7798720	say kds I wish the emailer had given us some specific examples of games like I know there
7798720	7803660	are games like that that don't have the customer and I know I've gone on this tangent on the
7803660	7809460	show before like games that have the really whack controls that you just can't re-customize
7809460	7812900	and yet now I'm drawing a total blank like I can't remember any of them I'm sure a chat
7812900	7818140	room will help us out here this is why I love having a live chat but yeah and then cutscenes
7818140	7824140	yeah that's kind of annoying or unskippable ones too like Mortal Kombat story mode it's
7824140	7831980	pretty cool and you can pause cutscenes but you can't skip them and unless it's your second
7831980	7835580	time playing through which I think is really weird because what I don't like is that in
7835580	7842020	Mortal Kombat if you are stuck on a certain part you have to keep watching the cutscene
7842020	7848980	leading up to it over and over until you beat it if you turn off the game because if you
7848980	7852060	just hit retry you don't have to watch the whole thing over and over but like sometimes
7852060	7855740	I get so frustrated I need to walk away for a little bit and then come back and the last
7855740	7860240	thing I want to do when I come back is watch the cutscene again so yeah by the way Xena
7860240	7864960	Core says no vegan diet no vegan powers I loved that whole scene oh that's from Scott
7864960	7873980	Pilgrim huh yeah I see what you did there okay um moving forward um hi Ola Crew this
7873980	7881900	is Ramadita I guess that's how I hope I pronounced it right a blind gamer from Indonesia I sent
7881900	7885920	you some emails a long time ago and this email will be absolutely be the sign that I'm still
7885920	7890140	following you until now great show as always although I cannot contribute my thoughts like
7890140	7893700	the other listeners because I cannot play games like others do I hope I can still be
7893700	7898220	part of all our discussion with my personal thought about video games I consider myself
7898220	7901780	as one of the veteran gamers because when I was a child video games were so easy to
7901780	7904820	be played even without my site sorry can I interrupt for real quick what was the name
7904820	7910780	of the email again rum rum Ramadita is that the same person that sent the scars of time
7910780	7918280	flute thing I think it is okay so okay like don't invalidate your opinion just because
7918280	7923760	you have like a challenge because you know in watching what you did with the scars of
7923760	7928740	time thing clearly you have a love and passion for video games so that makes you just as
7928740	7932020	much of a gamer as anybody else with just as much a right to your opinion as anyone
7932020	7936260	else just just throwing that out there okay I consider myself as one of the veteran gamers
7936260	7940140	because when I was a child video games are so easy to be played even without my site
7940140	7944540	my brother and friends helped me anyway that's why I know about classic games a lot and the
7944540	7948160	classic game of the week by dark Sakura is enjoyable for me besides Loki's funny mockery
7948160	7954980	of course so I would like to share the enjoyment I've gotten several months ago it was when
7954980	7960420	I found a angry video game nerd I love angry video game nerd and imported the DVDs from
7960420	7965340	the author I don't know if any one of you ever heard about a VGN it's a series of classic
7965340	7969580	video games featuring James as a nerd that plays old video games actually he reviewed
7969580	7975460	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the like the DVD sets recently and it was hilarious but
7975460	7981100	my favorite that he does is the Friday the 13th review so funny anyway okay he reviews
7981100	7986900	the negative sides of of games of badass style you'll see in here a lot of fucks and shits
7986900	7993980	in there beer included just google it or go to Wikipedia for more information and he linked
7993980	8003300	a video I want to share you should actually if you can I think a lot of people have seen
8003300	8008780	it I gotta admit I don't get get the big deal I think it's hilarious I want to share it
8008780	8012420	because the show is very enjoyable for me even without my ability to see what's happening
8012420	8017780	on screen I don't know what will happen to me if I am not blind and able to watch those
8017780	8022460	I believe you all can find some amusement there too now on to me like I said that I
8022460	8026980	am blind so I cannot play video games the same like others but I do and do enjoy online
8026980	8031100	games text-based and right now I'm playing blade of eternity and the link is blade of
8031100	8037380	eternity calm and reach level 148 besides I do enjoy video game music and I love playing
8037380	8042780	some of them using my flute just go to my youtube channel is the same guy yeah it's
8042780	8049580	a rip I'm gonna spell it out r-a-m-a-d-i-t-y-a Skywalker and watch my favorite is when I
8049580	8053740	played scars of time from chrono cross yep well that's all for me I hope this email can
8053740	8057220	be read and I will get more friends to talk about video games I only have a few local
8057220	8061900	friends that understand English and stuff like stuff I like anyway cheers from and I
8061900	8067140	hope I'm pronouncing it right r-a-m-a-d-i-t-y-a I think that's for muddy jazz I said it too
8067140	8073820	yeah very cool that's all that's very sweet I love the angry video game there to rush
8073820	8080220	it up hater there's a whole nother layer but I'm not gonna get into it that's all I'm gonna
8080220	8086420	say okay and it actually has nothing to do with that show specifically and I know that
8086420	8092540	makes no sense at all it's the dude no no no no no no no no just I'll tell you another
8092540	8100540	day okay hi all I was into the one from Holly no no offense how do you email us a lot hi

8109420	8118360	you're a Canadian they got resumes for 350 Canadian potential employees too thank you
8118360	8123780	Holly and then the last one that by the way I did hear about that and man somebody needs
8123780	8129380	to catch these hackers like at some point these hackers are gonna get too bold and let
8129380	8133500	me warn you because this might not be the same person that's doing the Sony folder can
8133500	8140940	you get well I know right but the problem is one of these days hacker you're gonna get
8140940	8146780	sloppy and you're gonna get caught and it doesn't matter which video game website you
8146780	8152260	get caught hacking you're gonna get blamed for the Sony thing by the mass media and if
8152260	8159140	you don't believe me go watch go rewatch that zany local news report about portal to to
8159140	8164580	watch the way that the media will construe things to get a story even if you say whatever
8164580	8168500	they want exactly even if you had nothing to do with the Sony hack if you get caught
8168500	8177220	hacking Square Enix's website you'll be the Sony hacker watch just saying I understand

8181680	8187420	to hack I'm just saying watch it and I should I shouldn't say your freedom to hack because
8187420	8191340	whoever hacked the Sony website did a fucked up thing that's not acceptable you just totally

8242860	8251740	Loki how about you yes apparently the Fox Entertainment Group has an FCC filing that
8251740	8260900	points to possibly a new video service coming to consoles and they're saying that Fox Entertainment
8260900	8267060	Group and its multi-channel video program distribution partners have shown intent that
8267060	8271540	they're planning on broadening their platforms that they offer content on and that it will
8271540	8276660	see subscription and on-demand video services available directly to wide-marketed consumer
8276660	8284140	electronics devices such as game consoles sometime in the near future so maybe something
8284140	8289260	that will be announced later on maybe something that's uh you know time like a capable provider
8289260	8297900	or something like that um let's see hmm do we don't we have enough video services on
8297900	8302700	consoles at this point though there's a lot between Netflix and Hulu although Hulu Plus
8302700	8308260	kind of sucks because of their ads you know you know you know I'm not a fan of ads and
8308260	8315660	paying for it it's one or the other not both anyhow one other story for you guys tonight
8315660	8320660	and then we're gonna get into the skype line whoopee 1877 game oil or actually I lie we're
8320660	8325700	gonna get into the FUs of the week and then the skype line 1877 game olr but first let
8325700	8331220	me read this quick story about Kid Icarus Uprising which of course is the 3ds Kid Icarus
8331220	8335780	game that's coming out soon maybe they'll announce the date for this at e3 I don't know
8335780	8339920	but there is a Japanese website out there for the game Kid Icarus Uprising it pretty
8339920	8344180	much recycles trailers that you've already seen but probably when we get to e3 you'll
8344180	8348220	see a lot more I imagine this game will be playable on the show floor at e3 so you're
8348220	8352540	gonna see a lot of content from it now some other stuff that's coming out of this though
8352540	8359700	is that Nintendo is going to be using fan me's on a float that will show up at the go
8359700	8369100	show gawara tachi neputa festival that happens in August me's will be joining pit and patina
8369100	8374300	and there's a whole page in Japanese on how you can create a me on your 3ds save it and
8374300	8380940	send it into Nintendo which I imagine it needs to be a g-rated me and not one of the ones
8380940	8389500	where you funny looking things yeah or celebrities but uh what's to stop Nintendo from just doing
8389500	8394220	random looking me is like nobody's gonna know the difference nobody knows what me is truly
8394220	8400140	a person or not s 200 mat in our chat room says goat say me needs to be on that float
8400140	8407100	no no no that that's exactly the type of me that will not be appearing so yay me's on
8407100	8412660	parade woohoo all right uh let's get into the fus of the week before I forget every
8412660	8414420	week on this show we do a little bit of ranting
8414420	8440460	fuck you to wbtv for being highly unprofessional I'm sorry you presented yourself as immature
8440460	8445380	unprofessional and clearly biased you're a hack you're a hack organization and that's
8445380	8452060	our opinion and so I'm writing an email looking fuck you to my new portable hard drive that's
8452060	8458220	USB powered for deleting said data on portable hard drive when I didn't want to I was like
8458220	8464580	why is this not working and then I looked on it oh it's empty thanks you know that's
8464580	8470360	never done that to me yeah I think I blame partly my 360 and I had to create a 360 data
8470360	8474700	partition in it well not really a data partition but usually they'll do it without erasing
8474700	8481940	data but it decided and I went where you use mine and mine was fine yeah but my 360 is
8481940	8485700	being retarded and didn't want to see the drive until I did that now finally sees the
8485700	8493220	drive so oh too bad yeah I'm sorry my fu of the week goes to Loki because he doesn't like
8493220	8501340	Lady Gaga she's brilliant he's a hater if that's my fu of the week then that means things
8501340	8505460	are going pretty good how about if you f you to headaches because I had a bad one yesterday
8505460	8509060	and I kind of was antisocial at a party because of it and that's never any fun I don't like
8509060	8515140	being antisocial that sucks and then f you to Loki all right let's get to the skype line

8519260	8522860	your voices you know what sometimes it's the same people that call every week and that's
8522860	8527060	fine it's open for all right now I'm actually really proud of this line and I would like

8531620	8535380	my email so far um all right sure what the hell but I'm cutting you off soon as the call
8535380	8538740	comes in okay to whom it may concern first and foremost I am an adult fan of video games
8538740	8543300	and female I am friends with several adopted friends who were shot who were shocked you
8543300	8548860	gave attention to the single person okay I need to rephrase that basically I've got friends
8548860	8553060	that are adopted the play portal don't care okay I said my friends play portal too with
8553060	8556420	me and think adoption jokes are just as fun oh I'm cutting you off because you're getting
8556420	8560620	a phone call let's go to the phones at one eight seven seven game olr hi you're on orange
8560620	8565180	launch radio who's this hey this is excellent hey excellent how you doing hey doing good
8565180	8568980	I want to call in and chime in for a minute about blizzard and their customer service
8568980	8572140	somebody said they didn't like the way they were doing it but actually every time when
8572140	8576180	I have talked to somebody through the customer service through very few problems I had of
8576180	8580380	course playing wow and whatnot I had really good service including an item that I ordered
8580380	8585180	from their store do tell share a little more share a little more about your positive experience
8585180	8589580	because we well we often have a lot of negativity so let's hear something good well I'll talk
8589580	8594300	about the store um somehow with my paypal account instead of putting the right address
8594300	8599780	which was on there they somehow got my old address when um this was before I moved and
8599780	8604220	before I got changed I didn't realize it so I realized it the night after the order was
8604220	8610860	placed I called in but unfortunately the package had already shipped so they had to wait for
8610860	8616300	it to try to be delivered and then they can cancel so they whoever it was at the door
8616300	8619900	thank god there was nobody there living there in my old apartment at the time so it got
8619900	8626820	sent back to them but they were they not only replaced the old package with a new one but
8626820	8632380	they also refunded the money to my account which I thought was a little odd but hey it
8632380	8637340	was you know so I technically got the item for free but um the guy who walked me through
8637340	8642580	and tried to help me as much as he could not only did TA do it through the phone in a very
8642580	8649420	positive and nice fashion but also kept up with accordingly like almost every few hours
8649420	8653540	by email which was very nice and I mean he did flood the mailbox like every three to
8653540	8657720	four hours it's like one email in the morning one email in the evening saying here's what
8657720	8662700	we got here's what we're gonna do here's what the game so constant communication yes
8662700	8666900	and that is that is a very important part of customer service you know um I don't talk
8666900	8670760	a lot about my day job here on Orange Lawn Tradio because I really want to keep my two
8670760	8674040	lives separated I do not want the line being blurred between what I do during the night
8674040	8678500	what I do during the day because I you know it's just it's not it's not okay for the
8678500	8683260	two lines to be crossed however I trained for nine years in customer service I trained
8683260	8687780	for a large large call center here in the area on customer service and I'll tell you
8687780	8692000	one of the things that we were really big on was making sure that you know information
8692000	8696100	was always communicated the customer communication is so key I think because people don't call
8696100	8701540	into places or email or whatever to hear I don't know or you know there's nothing we
8701540	8705640	can do about that they want it resolution that's why you pick up the phone and call
8705640	8710180	somebody in the first place so yeah and it was it was really cool because he's like yes
8710180	8714980	sir no sir and he had a very positive attitude it's like it's like almost that he was like
8714980	8718620	talking to my good talk to like a best friend or a good friend about something he's like
8718620	8723480	yeah you know hey it happens you know no problem when you look into it hey listen I got a place
8723480	8727640	to hold um I promise I'll be right back and if I don't I got your information right here
8727640	8731380	I'll call you right back and we'll walk we'll try to see what we can do and it was very
8731380	8736760	nice and a lot of companies most times when you call it's kind of like I don't care I'm
8736760	8743100	just going to do it's more robotic and you know it's like why did I do this in the first
8743100	8747700	place when I just can do this through email and just probably get the same response so
8747700	8753060	well look I I don't know what Holly's thing is with Blizzard right now I don't know specifically
8753060	8756900	well I might but I wouldn't I wouldn't try to tell it on the show for somebody else anyway
8756900	8762060	but as I can tell you where I come from and it's you know obviously we play wow together
8762060	8766300	you know I love wow I have the I wouldn't have a fucking podcast about wow if I didn't
8766300	8770380	love World of Warcraft but sometimes I get a little negative on Horde House because Blizzard
8770380	8774860	just makes these decisions as a corporation that you just look at it and your jaw is just
8774860	8778700	dropped like what the fuck are you doing like okay let me let me let me give you an analogy
8778700	8783640	wait hold on let me give me an analogy okay like let's assume you've got a friend and
8783640	8788100	like you know this is your bro he's your he's your guy he's one of your best friends you
8788100	8793700	know you know whatever and suddenly this guy starts dating this girl and you just don't
8793700	8800500	like her because she's drama and she just she is always making it about her and she
8800500	8805700	causes him to make bad decisions and she's such just a negative influence on his life
8805700	8811300	and she's just a bitch but you smile and you nod through it because you love your friend
8811300	8816300	then you know he's happy even though you know she's really really poisonous for him but
8816300	8823240	you just kind of just nod knowing that someday he'll wise up and call it off well that bitch's
8823240	8830660	name is Activision definitely there's there's been times when I've seen some of the stuff
8830660	8834700	they're supposedly going to do inside the game and I'm looking at this stuff and announcements
8834700	8838620	I'm like what the fuck are they doing with this shit seriously are they going to actually
8838620	8844020	make us pay for all this stuff that should be free in the first place and I love listening
8844020	8849380	to other people's also other people's podcasts of course I listen to yours too Rob but it's
8849380	8854020	kind of funny hearing that people come up like you you would say something and you'd
8854020	8857420	be like okay I can believe blizzard's doing this what the fuck and then somebody else
8857420	8862700	staying on the same line going you know what I think blizzard's going overboard with this
8862700	8866260	and this is stupid and I can't believe they're actually doing this because they're trying
8866260	8871540	to get you know more money into the pot so to speak so I think they could do about a
8871540	8876020	lot of this stuff or you know it's everything doesn't have to be quote unquote a premium
8876020	8880260	fee I think that's taking a little overboard and you know what's funny is that yet again
8880260	8884500	we have a case of the worker bee is doing a great job and the worker bee in this case
8884500	8887740	being the customer service reps you interact with they're representing their company very
8887740	8891700	well the problem when we talk about issues we have with blizzard it is not with the worker
8891700	8896260	bees it's with the queen bee it's with the people up top that are making the decisions
8896260	8902420	and you're just your head I can't face palm give me that picture of captain John Luke
8902420	8907420	Picard face palming because that's god half the stories I read on horde house need that
8907420	8912620	caption yeah no joke all right I didn't need to bring more people like us the average people
8912620	8916220	in there and let them tell them what's going on you know like I don't think this is gonna
8916220	8919580	be wise you know you're gonna lose a lot of money to deal with this so that you know you
8919580	8922840	would think that they have a better group of focus gamers but maybe they're just really
8922840	8926820	worried about you know rumors and things getting out because you know the wow community is
8926820	8931660	a very passionate group and anything we're saying guys if you're like oh god with the
8931660	8939100	wow talk okay any mmo any mmo goes through this and wow just happens to be a big one

8981860	8987860	game is as admitted by one of the other antagonists a moron the same antagonist is a passive aggressive
8987860	8992300	homicidal computer that takes steps to discourage the character being played not player there's
8992300	8996460	also insult slung out towards overweight people and those of lower than average intelligence
8996460	9000880	so should they also rise up in protest should the fatties and morons also call your station
9000880	9007180	expect the same coverage as the adoptive parent you know what that's a very good point that
9007180	9014340	the story overlooks is that um the character is supposed to be a moron yeah this is not
9014340	9019780	somebody you're supposed to model yourself after this is an idiot bully as it said in
9019780	9025620	the game designed by the greatest minds of their generation to create the dumbest moron
9025620	9031580	who ever lived interesting I like that perspective that's pretty cool 1877 game olr or our username
9031580	9034780	on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call and maybe I'll try to hang
9034780	9040500	up on you and not succeed I would ask if there's any last minute stories but loki left the
9040500	9044380	room real quick I think he's chatting with dan about something real quick is he chatting

9066380	9070940	kind of shows off some of the new features for fifa 12 uh looks kind of neat they're
9070940	9078340	kind of making more realistic now they have um apparently you can do some they have unexpected
9078340	9083480	behaviors that'll happen like for example um you know a defender coming in offensive
9083480	9090380	player making a move that you know flips the player um you know uh apparently you can get
9090380	9097800	injuries and um you know realistic injuries they're going to have better uh dribbling
9097800	9104140	and um basically kind of a whole new engine that they're putting in place here let me
9104140	9106660	get to the phone so we've got another call coming in hi you're on orange laundry who's
9106660	9111460	this yo guys it's in a court long time no see how y'all doing it's been a while how
9111460	9117020	are you doing buddy just trying to make that paper you know make it rain all right what's
9117020	9123080	up not much man not much blowing some time trying to get through la noir without cursing
9123080	9126820	my head off and waking up the entire neighborhood tell us a little bit about la noir you know
9126820	9132380	i actually have a question real quick oh is time enjoying being blown stop all right la
9132380	9136700	you're a dirty girl i want to yes i am yes i am she's off the hook tonight all right
9136700	9141300	uh talking about um uh la noir a little bit because you know it's not a game i've played
9141300	9144500	yet because i didn't think it would be something i was interested in because i'm not super
9144500	9147680	into the whole grand theft auto thing like it's cool and all but i'm just not very good
9147680	9151980	at it but in listening to bobby's show before us tonight he doesn't really play these types
9151980	9155780	of games either but his callers are like no dude this is like a throwback to an adventure
9155780	9160640	game what do you think of la noir oh so you guys actually haven't covered it on your show
9160640	9165820	yet i thought i was chasing behind all my shows i'm trying to get in touch with can
9165820	9172100	i ask you a question do you find the period specificness of the game a little bit bothersome
9172100	9177780	no actually i enjoy it okay well i at first i didn't know what dan was playing at the
9177780	9181060	time and then i was hearing the guy making the comments about jews and i was like what
9181060	9185900	the hell are you playing uh oh yeah that first guy i didn't even think of that so yeah he's
9185900	9189540	quite livid he is oh you should call the local news media and tell them how offended you
9189540	9194100	are you know what i don't give a shit because it's a period specific game i just didn't
9194100	9197900	know he was playing at the time so like what the hell are you listening to yeah that guy
9197900	9202260	is a racist so of course he's gonna curse it up a bit yeah well anyway so so let me
9202260	9205900	get back to the game a little bit no i mean i can't say we haven't covered la noir on
9205900	9209460	the show i mean we've talked about it it's just none of us have yet to play it so we
9209460	9213940	can't tell you like how it is as a game so i'm relying on you my friend how is uh how
9213940	9217380	is la noir as a game tell us a little bit about it all right let me let me set it up
9217380	9222180	to so i can describe it in as it'd be as rhetorical as possible but you get all the information
9222180	9227580	in there uh it plays like grand theft auto but it doesn't play like grand theft auto
9227580	9232020	and the fact that you are a police officer and you're not supposed to run amok which
9232020	9238900	is the whole game the focus is on police investigation and the process of police investigation so
9238900	9244720	and the highlighting of the facial animations and using that to be able to tell if people
9244720	9252340	are lying or not is the main focus of the game so see it's csi 1940s basically sounds
9252340	9261380	a lot like law and order in 1940s yeah it's exactly what that is i mean this game you
9261380	9266420	truly if you're not gonna cheat your way through it and use the online stuff uh it truly is
9266420	9270660	a mental game you have to think your way through it and you can still get through the game
9270660	9274820	and still fail left and right but you will get a completely different experience because
9274820	9280260	you didn't real if you investigate a person and you're able to draw information out of
9280260	9285740	them you have more things to use and search for later on in the case until you come to
9285740	9290580	the end of it so am i hearing you right that you can't really lose this game it's just
9290580	9296460	that there will be hallways you never go down if you don't do it well correct interesting
9296460	9302380	yeah so the replay is in trying to do the cases better but if you happen to ace all
9302380	9306620	the cases you pretty much see most of the content interesting i don't know however it's
9306620	9310740	it right away also because the game is built like a twist to plot it's very easy to add
9310740	9316060	content to all they have to do is since all the tech is done get the actors do the recordings
9316060	9319500	and insert them within the engine and you could kick this game could keep going you
9319500	9324140	can have like five six volumes of cases they've probably already done and have some waiting
9324140	9329300	in the can as far as the voice acting goes don't doubt it yeah it's like i'm having a
9329300	9334100	ball even slipping the jargon every once in a while you know yeah but that's the way we
9334100	9338380	are in the house here you know role players they gotta flex their role play muscles next
9338380	9342860	you know that's the life of a pig man you just got to deal with it you know i i this
9342860	9346460	game was i mean it was kind of it was on my radar certainly because everybody's been talking
9346460	9350620	about it but i was like oh it's a rock star game i'm not i don't usually feel those so
9350620	9354380	much whatever i'm sure i'm sure they're great games but i'll never probably get into it
9354380	9357660	but then you know when i heard people tell you about it's like an old school pc adventure
9357660	9363080	game with how you kind of like selecting so i was like really now now you i've i'm suddenly
9363080	9368060	interested in this a lot more and just kind of sounds pretty cool yeah it's tied in really
9368060	9374140	well they do they did their their uh due diligence on actually trying to make the city as closely
9374140	9381060	to 19 uh late 1940s la as possible so like all the the billboards are where they're supposed
9381060	9386800	to be and all this other stuff um i was gonna say alcan anagram in our chat room says this
9386800	9391460	sounds like ace attorney interesting is it like like a phoenix right type thing yeah
9391460	9395380	yeah it's actually closer than that than anything else i mean you do you do have to drive from
9395380	9399620	point to point and they add the the grand theft auto things by responding to calls you'll
9399620	9404580	hear a call for uh officer needs support this and that you roll up on a bank robbery or
9404580	9409900	somebody's trying to rob a convenience store you know uh officers and chase you got to
9409900	9414260	cut them off i mean that's all in there as well as your standard stuff of driving your
9414260	9419940	car but the focus is on the investigation itself like for instance for example one of
9419940	9425700	the cases involves a woman and her niece getting put in the car while they're drugged and and
9425700	9430220	the car goes over a cliff but they survive it so you do you do your interviews to figure
9430220	9434420	out what's going on you later on tail her and figure out she's got ties to the mob and
9434420	9438860	she's going after the guy that drugged them and put them in the car if you don't get to
9438860	9443100	the spot if you get there in time you can catch them in the act of trying to toss the
9443100	9447580	place and arrest them if you don't if you take too long to get there you have to deal
9447580	9450980	with the aftermath and you have to use your csi skills to figure out what they were looking
9450980	9457140	for hmm so yeah it's the way they put the gameplay in there plus later on the order
9457140	9462940	that you investigate the locations determines who's available when so if you go to like
9462940	9465940	for instance there's this grocer you have to investigate but for some reason they're
9465940	9470020	closed until like two three o'clock in the afternoon so if you go there too early you'll
9470020	9473980	miss your chance to do something else like catch this one guy while he's in the bar you
9473980	9478500	have to go hunt him down later interesting yeah so the entire case is interwoven like
9478500	9481860	that like a big twist of plot but let me ask you another question real quick for let you
9481860	9486460	go because I want to make sure we can free up for more calls but I've heard a lot about
9486460	9491020	how this game really seems to be pushing that line between game and movie like I've heard
9491020	9495500	about some cases where it's actually being considered art I think somebody I don't know
9495500	9498420	some gallery or something was actually kind of putting this game on display or what have
9498420	9502340	you what do you think about this game is this game really pushing the envelope between what
9502340	9508580	is a movie television visual art and a video game which not everyone considers art if you're
9508580	9514580	Roger Ebert well let me let me say it like this I was watching you guys familiar with
9514580	9520980	red letter media no okay he's the red letter media is the guys who went behind Mr. Plinkett
9520980	9525680	and ripping apart the Star Wars trilogy and they're like their movies are their reviews
9525680	9530060	are extremely in-depth and they started up a show they mentioned the fact that movies
9530060	9536940	have become the lowest form of entertainment as far as outlook and what you expect from
9536940	9542680	them like you know like some people aren't willing to throw 10 bucks at a bad movie and
9542680	9546220	the way movies have been going down now maybe they're not making as much money as they could
9546220	9550180	be if they're spending more time writing scripts and stuff they are doing that in gaming so
9550180	9554220	that has stepped up as far as the public eye is looking for entertainment and this is just
9554220	9561700	going to add fuel to that fire I mean the fact that the the facial expressions add so
9561700	9567040	much to the way you're trying to I mean literally I was second-guessing almost every decision
9567040	9570560	I was making on whether these people were lying or not based off what I knew about the
9570560	9576740	case and it was driving me nuts interesting and the way they added there's a small audio
9576740	9580580	cue that lets you know whether or not you picked if they're telling the truth if you
9580580	9584740	doubt their answer or if they're flat-out lying they have a little three-note piano
9584740	9588580	thing to let you know when you pick correctly incorrectly the instant you push the button
9588580	9594060	so it just adds to that suspense you're going to hear that tone and when you mess it up
9594060	9598000	you just want to go rage comic all over the thing but it's great I love every minute of
9598000	9600980	it all right well you guys have sold me that I need to check it out I don't know if I'll
9600980	9604860	drop $60 for it but I'm certainly gonna rent it and check it out yeah yeah definitely worth
9604860	9608220	the rental all right absolutely all right Zinek or I gotta let you go so we can wrap
9608220	9611900	up the show but take care and thanks for calling hey no problem guys I'll take it easy I do

9652940	9664940	have Kenji Inafune is actually in the new Japanese RPG Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 it's
9664940	9672140	a sequel to the Hyperdimension Neptunia game that came out I believe last year I know over
9672140	9679740	here in March basically he plays I don't really know himself but there is screenshots of him
9679740	9685560	shooting a laser out of his mouth and he also appears to be a weapon that this woman is
9685560	9691180	using and it's kind of like console wars the game because each woman is like a different
9691180	9697800	it represents a different console hmm but it's weird all right well that's gonna do
9697800	9701300	it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio tonight we're gonna now go around and get
