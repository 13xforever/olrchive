14008	19690	Tonight, May 22, 2011, some PSP games are rumored to be remade for the PlayStation 3.
20490	26452	An anticipated 3DS title is delayed, and will Nintendo's new home console be equipped with a camera?
31400	35361	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35402	41764	It's the show where every gamer has a voice and this is episode number 414 for May the 22nd of 2011.
42484	43344	My name is Rob Roberts.
43364	46206	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts.
46266	48806	First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48947	49207	Yo.
49427	49987	How are you doing?
50507	50807	Yo.
51087	51447	Yo.
51768	52048	Ho.
52128	52448	Hey.
53608	55389	I heard you got drunk last night.
55709	56609	Dan coming to say hi on the show?
84821	88943	No, he's currently just... Alright, well I have to introduce the other host that's here that's not Dan.
88983	91083	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster, Loki!
91403	92624	Yes, I'm definitely not Dan.
92744	93464	How are you, Loki?
94064	94945	I'm fine.
95425	96705	That's good, Loki.
97686	98246	What's new with you?
100467	100907	Not much.
101467	102728	Just sitting at home.
102788	103328	You're boring.
104048	107009	Well, you know, I started some projects.
107049	108069	Well, more projects.
108129	109029	I'm ponding projects.
109489	115051	No, I started my three foot tall paper craft statue of the portal turret.
116031	116771	That's right.
117031	119252	I keep forgetting you're building your own portal turret.
119532	120832	That kind of cracks me up.
121232	121813	I don't know why.
122653	123153	I want one.
124198	138728	Well, as soon as I get the design correct, because right now, unfortunately, the 3D model I ported over using Peppercura had a lot of internal stuff, because it was actually a full 3D model with the actual guns and stuff.
138768	141290	This turret's not going to have the doors open with the guns showing.
142431	152298	But it still tried to create papercraft pieces for all that stuff that you're never going to see, so I had to filter out the stuff that I didn't need.
152478	153719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
178456	181279	I played some World of Warcraft and slept in And then I went to a very gay Jewish party
205356	207517	First off, can I say fuck that Rapture guy?
207697	215679	Like, fuck him in the ear, and fuck CNN, and fuck MSNBC, and all these websites that give him attention, and, like, make people want to tweet about it and all that stuff.
215699	216440	And look, I'm no better.
216500	222962	I made my fair share of Rapture jokes, but I'm not talking about, like, snarky Facebook posts, because that's what websites like that are for.
223022	225643	But, like, you know, there's real news going on in the world.
225703	225963	It's just...
226843	239604	Yes, I realize this is a video game podcast, but I'm on my soapbox I made a funny picture It just astounds me that some asshole can come out and say No, really guys, it's gonna end May 21st, so sell your shit I'm totally surreal For real, for real, real
241414	245897	So, I'm going to just say the world's going to end on Christmas.
246137	247578	It's going to be really fucking ironic.
247719	248979	We're going to all die on Christmas.
249400	250761	So, there you go.
251121	255764	Now listen to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to hear more of the gospel.
255865	260548	Isn't it allegedly supposed to end December 2012 because of the Mayan calendar?
260568	262029	It's always supposed to fucking end.
262069	263450	Well, on top of that, too, this is...
266332	267855	Me getting into a little bit of technical history.
268255	273804	If I am right, the Mayans used a lunar calendar, meaning that their months are on a different basis than it would be on the Gregorian calendar.
273824	276629	Because right now, it's like halfway through the Jewish year.
277895	282018	Yeah, but I'm sure no one would jump to conclusions in saying that the world's going to end on a specific date.
282038	285201	They obviously have some scientific fact to back that up.
285761	288903	I mean, what are we, savages?
289424	297270	No one just goes out spouting random garbage like the world's going to end yesterday and it doesn't happen without any sort of...
297910	298170	Proof.
298190	300511	This is just the irony to me is that they can't find the dude.
301171	302812	Camping was named Harold Camping.
303872	310014	And that the family radio, the site that he's like the president of, is down.
310514	314155	So I posted in the chat room the picture that I made about the URL being raptured.
315578	316279	DarkSakura.com
331656	333498	You're my crack dealer now.
334939	336560	Which, by the way, I need you to look at my setup later.
337221	337481	I will.
337821	339603	Yeah, I played some World of Warcraft.
339943	341664	I put Rebecca Black on hold.
342465	346949	And I am now playing Bladwyn, who is a shammy, who I'm kicking butt with.
347429	347909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
365916	369637	One of these days I'm going to actually read a comic book and then be all like, I should be on Comic Insanity.
369677	379721	I did that on Comic Insanity this morning too because Shadow was talking about Final Fantasy IX and he and Tiara were like, oh, Final Fantasy IX.
379821	380881	I'm like, I don't play it.
381021	382142	I got up and got some coffee.
383382	384123	DoorPrize
399402	400443	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
422917	431239	When you're in the top office, you go in behind a file cabinet is a door that leads you to three more vitrified doors and then where the Borealis dock is.
431679	438301	So you'll get the door prize thing for listening to Cave Johnson rant like a madman and then finding the remnants of the Borealis.
440821	441241	I did that.
441301	448083	The next one I'm doing is Smash TV where you have to break all the 11 monitors that Wheatley's jabbering at you at.
448763	449703	Some of those are pretty hard.
451864	454406	The key to doing the Wheatley ones is lasers.
454486	457689	Yeah, I know that, but I'm just saying some of the ones that had no lasers.
458249	460211	And I've got to go back and get the turret symphony.
461091	462292	The turrets practicing singing.
462713	463033	Oh, yes.
463113	464034	I have that one.
464894	469238	And I also need to get secret transmission, which actually, there's two secret transmissions in Portal 2, I found out.
470479	470579	Oh.
471557	484178	and everybody listen up when you're doing the aerial faith plate test the big one with all the room full of faith plates and GLaDOS shoots garbage at you you take
485802	486382	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
508758	527810	but you also go back and when you launch into the one that's on the ramp but your other portal is going to be on this thing across from the part jutting out and it busts you through a window and you find another Ratman Den and if you've got the radio with you it will play a modem sound and what that does is it actually translates into an image if you've got a decoder.
528730	529110	Wow.
529871	540075	Because, you know, they had the whole ARG thing going on, the alternate reality game, that was basically connecting to a BBS with an old 33K modem or something.
540315	540515	Right.
541235	543436	And all these images and stuff would go through.
544736	545857	I miss BBSs.
546949	551516	I want a BBS for Orange Lounge Radio where I can play Trade Wars 2002 all over again.
551536	561271	The other one is when you're in the lower labs and you're playing in commentary mode, you'll find a developer commentary that's nothing but modem noise and it's a picture too.
562910	564171	Actually, it's not a picture.
564531	568494	It's them talking about part of the development of Portal 2.
568594	569175	Wait, this is important.
569195	570536	Nerds in chat, I need to know.
571036	576581	Can you still download Telguard and stuff and set it up to run off of Telnet or whatever?
576941	577241	Probably.
577301	577942	Is that possible?
578382	579483	Because we need to make that happen.
579763	580283	Probably.
581344	586609	Oh, come on, there's so many retro gamers out there that I bet there's still a gemstone server running somewhere.
586629	587870	Ooh, I haven't played that in forever.
587890	591874	The third achievement is by picking up the broken turret that gets launched in there.
591894	592775	Oh, yeah, turret dactyl.
594056	597599	Yeah, if you launch a turret with an aerial faith plate, you get an achievement for it.
597619	598140	Oh, that I've done.
598180	598820	I know I did that.
599461	600342	I didn't do that one either.
600362	601963	I need to do more co-op.
602103	602984	I haven't played enough.
603104	605907	I'll play co-op with you, but I'll probably end up throwing up all over Shermie.
607108	607888	I don't know, he's a cat.
608788	611949	I watch the Human Vault section, so.
611969	615790	Black Wolf in the chatroom says, yes, and there are lots of Telnet BBSs out there.
615930	617490	OMG, I want an OLR1.
617570	619231	Like, really bad.
619551	620311	Like, come on, you guys.
620351	621891	Somebody in the chatroom, do it.
622432	623072	No, I'll do it.
623412	624052	Rob will do it, okay.
624092	625852	I'll do it, because I want to be the sysop.
626433	626713	Okay.
628713	632494	I always wanted my own BBS when I was a kid, but my mom wouldn't let me get a second phone line.
633664	635485	So let's set up the OLRBBS.
635505	636666	Yeah, I want an OLRBBS.
636786	637047	Okay.
637107	637847	Let me make that happen.
638488	639108	Alright, anyhow.
639408	639869	Anything else?
640449	642150	We have like two different conversations going on here.
642450	649956	One of them very modern with Portal 2 and the other one not so modern with BBSs and Telnet and The Pit and Trade Wars.
650136	651337	I actually... Legend of the Red Dragon.
652237	658001	I actually did try to play some of the DAC, but my computer farted on me while I was trying to play the Star Trek.
659241	661463	And I tried playing Darwinia.
662063	663003	That game's confusing.
663824	664925	And it gives me a bit of a headache.
666305	670148	So I'm gonna have to probably take a whole bunch of Midol and try playing it again.
670588	672189	Because no, it really does give me a headache.
673710	676991	The modeling in it, and the colors, makes my head hurt.
678372	679133	So, sadness.
679153	679513	Sadness.
682609	684970	No, stuff like that's always done it to me.
686871	688871	And then I played Buy Shermie Cat Food the game.
690192	690532	The end.
691332	696614	I wish I could say that I played exciting stuff, but I haven't.
697174	698414	I've just played Grand Theft Auto.
699034	702535	And a brief bit of Portal, because I was trying to test something on my graphics card.
702575	707417	Because for some reason in Grand Theft Auto on my PC, it decided, hey, you know what, I'm going to run really slow now.
708217	708757	And I was like, what?
708997	713038	Why are you running slow when you're running perfectly fine just, you know, all the other days?
713878	724600	And it ended up that I was trying to overclock my laptop's graphics card, and I think the program running in the background slowed things down, actually.
725401	731382	Because I did a cooling mod on this thing, so I actually have the fans kicked up, and there's a big old intake vent in the back now.
732002	736823	And I normally have, like, a cooling pad that go on the bottom of this, but I don't have it with me right now.
737663	743184	It's running much cooler, and so now I can actually overclock the GPU when I get a chance.
744064	745625	I haven't really bothered to make it stable yet.
748425	754126	So yeah, but I will be playing later on tonight, once I get done moving some stuff around.
754686	763128	I have a leaked copy of the Duke Nukem Forever demo that I will be checking out, because Duke Nukem Forever is awesome, and the fact that I can play a part of it
764879	767260	I didn't realize it already had leaked.
767941	770302	Oh yeah, they have an internal demo that's really, really buggy.
770882	774184	Because the real one's out, what, June 3rd or something like that?
774204	774404	Yes.
776125	776345	Awesome.
777452	777912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
799878	800398	Well, not new.
800478	803160	This game's like two years old, and I'm just now getting around to it.
803340	809323	It's the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame Collection I played this week on Xbox 360.
810443	816927	I actually had this game on the Wii a few years ago, and there was like a year difference between the releases.
817027	819488	One of them came out in 08, I think, and the other one came out in 09.
820068	823830	And I played the newer one, the 360 one, which was also released on PS3.
824610	827672	And it's old pinball games, and they're classic tables.
828252	828732	Redone for the 360
847917	848958	We had one in my garage.
849198	851159	The old school Black Knight, Pinbot.
851219	854881	Everybody knows Pinbot because they had an NES game of Pinbot so you can play the authentic table.
854921	856322	Pinbot's actually kind of a crappy table.
856622	857702	Like it's a cheap ass table.
857722	858903	Bride of Pinbot is great.
859103	861885	I like Bride of Pinbot but that sadly is not in this compilation.
862045	863345	Neither is Theater of Magic.
863426	866187	Actually Jackbot is the best of the bot ones.
866547	868408	And that's, no, not in the collection either.
868948	870329	But there's some other interesting tables.
870369	872510	I think about 12 tables in all.
874792	875352	Certainly the
876299	877140	I sound quiet?
877240	878280	I shouldn't sound quiet?
880001	880201	No?
880862	882723	Everybody in chat says I sound fine.
883183	885004	Of course, live radio, the joys of that.
885765	888286	Anyhow, I'll turn myself up just a wee bit.
888386	888806	There you go.
890407	892849	Other things about the compilation.
892889	903815	It's kind of weird because some of the games are free, and then some of them will cost you credits, which is odd to me, that you just don't get everything for free at the start, but I guess it wants to give you something to work towards.
904655	909039	But as far as the important stuff, the translation itself, you know, it works.
909319	909760	It's nice.
910460	922130	A little bit pricey probably, you know, considering it's, I think it was about 40 bucks when it came out, you know, just for 12 tables when you got Pinball FX that offers, you know, some pretty competitive tables at a good price.
922431	925093	But now that the game's kind of old, you can probably find it really cheap.
925433	929797	And if you are a pinball fan, you should probably pick it up because it's a good compilation of games.
930357	944705	Otherwise, continuing to play some of the games I talked about last week, like Might and Magic, Order of Chaos, or whatever it's called, the puzzle game on 360, and some other stuff, like Mortal Kombat, which I've had very mixed success playing it online.
945105	953749	Sometimes it's very laggy, sometimes it's pretty smooth, but every time I lose horrifically, because I'm really bad at Mortal Kombat, and that makes me sad.
954850	956351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
976448	977849	We're not going to be here with the show next week.
977869	980129	We're actually going to take the week off because of Memorial Day.
980309	982830	And I'm actually going to be out of town on top of that.
982910	985431	So sadly, we will not be here next week, Memorial Day.
985691	986712	I'm hating you right now, Rob.
986972	987412	I'm sorry.
987432	988472	I'm being hateful and judgmental.
988512	990533	I will make it up to you in three weeks.
990973	991293	I know.
991793	993774	In three weeks, it's going to be more awesomer.
995355	997656	I need to find 50 bucks to get a Duffy.
997896	1001057	I'm going to be going to the happiest place on earth twice within a month's span.
1001217	1002117	But that's just the way it works.
1002137	1003638	Hateful, jealous, judgmental.
1003838	1004618	Well, deal with it.
1005953	1006173	Rob, Hearts
1029236	1045964	so we're hoping we can kind of get some reports from him and interject that with our own sassy commentary and the rest of your voices on the internet through Twitter and so forth so we're looking at doing some type of E3 specials we're not sure exactly what time yet but that will happen the week of E3 I've already been limbering my eyes up
1047766	1052671	So I can roll them like nothing else when I see the Nintendo press conference.
1052691	1053993	He's gonna roll it like a Katamari.
1054013	1056175	I'll be like, oh god, seriously?
1056275	1057737	This is your great idea?
1058998	1061021	I have low expectations for Nintendo.
1061421	1063103	Let's see if they can limbo under that.
1064202	1065202	Alright, well we'll see.
1065422	1070403	And I'm really hoping we can get Loki to come to the show whenever Nintendo's press conference.
1070523	1073164	Ideally, well you'll have to work whenever.
1073324	1074464	When is the Nintendo press conference?
1074484	1075764	It's during the day.
1075964	1080365	I technically don't work when those are going on because I'll stop what I'm doing and watch it.
1081265	1084486	Because I want to get your immediate reaction to those press conferences.
1084506	1085486	Oh, I'll be on Twitter.
1085806	1088266	Like, what the fuck is that?
1088966	1089426	Really?
1090047	1091067	That's your great idea?
1091487	1092227	Oh, awesome.
1092907	1097729	We need to do some type of like where we are commenting on the press conferences as they're going on.
1098009	1099429	And then you can like download it later on.
1099489	1100850	It's like a Rift Tracks type of thing.
1101490	1101790	I don't know.
1101810	1102830	We'll see.
1103210	1103791	We can do that.
1105051	1111973	It's technically possible because they do syndicate that stuff later on so that you can rewatch the actual videos and stuff.
1111993	1113554	So we could do that.
1114460	1115881	Nah, too much effort.
1116121	1116842	Yeah, exactly.
1117462	1118683	I would say that.
1118843	1121686	Alright, so we will not be here next week on Memorial Day weekend, sadly.
1121766	1125869	We will be back the week after, though, which happens to be the Sunday before E3.
1126269	1128551	And that's when the news is really going to start to roll in.
1128611	1131213	In fact, I think we're going to get to a story on this later.
1131473	1134615	One of the developers is doing their press conference Sunday night.
1134635	1136197	They're kind of getting a jump on everybody else.
1136637	1138498	So, it's going to be very interesting.
1138679	1140640	So, the news will start flooding in in two weeks.
1140740	1145002	I might actually do a little bit of commentary on my Tumblr as well.
1146003	1147084	All across the internets.
1147124	1147804	Yeah, why not?
1148725	1151246	They're looking to have one million viewers.
1153347	1154168	Let's move on.
1154488	1156669	Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.
1156709	1161212	There's still a lot going on in the gaming world ramping up to E3 this week.
1161292	1163413	So let's go to Loki who's going to start us off tonight.
1163686	1168631	Yes, Sony announced their titles that are going to be a part of the Welcome Back program.
1169612	1177561	Of course, the Welcome Back program includes a free 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus for all PlayStation Network users.
1177801	1183147	Also, they're going to be giving out a 30-day trial to Curiosity, I guess.
1185765	1187407	Her Curiosity, whatever.
1187787	1188728	I'm calling it Curiosity.
1190309	1198176	And then also, apparently, two free PlayStation games and two free PlayStation Portable games.
1200899	1207385	Of the free PlayStation 3 games that are available for North America, because it's a little bit different in each region...
1208405	1214930	Dead Nation, Infamous, LittleBigPlanet, SuperStardustHD, and WipeoutHD plus Fury.
1216091	1219833	Well, I already own two of those, so that's going to narrow down my choices of what I'm going to get.
1220074	1220694	Exactly.
1221054	1222255	Same here.
1222555	1230401	For PSP owners, I guess, you'll be able to get LittleBigPlanet on PSP, Mod Nation Racers, Pursuit Force, or Killzone Liberation.
1231441	1253556	and then of course they're going to have a selection of On Us movie rentals through the PlayStation Network and I guess existing PlayStation Plus subscribers will receive an additional 60 days of free subscription and existing Music Unlimited Premium Trial subscription members will receive an additional 30 days of free music as well and also an additional 30 days
1254817	1260904	Plus time lost for existing members of the Music Unlimited Premium Basic Subscription fee free of charge.
1260964	1268413	And in home, of course, they're going to have 100 free items in home.
1269554	1271876	Can one of those items be useful clubhouses?
1272697	1272797	No.
1272817	1274239	Damn.
1276414	1279498	In Europe, they're going to be doing some slightly different titles.
1280479	1288850	They're going to have Ratchet & Clank, Quest for Booty, Wipeout HD, Fury, Dead Nation, Infamous, and LittleBigPlanet.
1289371	1292895	And then, of course, on PSP... Actually, the titles are the same on PSP.
1295018	1296640	I guess it can be slightly different for each region.
1297040	1303507	Which begs the question, since PlayStation Network accounts are free to create, I had three of them.
1304048	1309514	So I guess I get six games because I had three accounts created.
1309714	1314675	Is there going to be a thing where maybe you have to have used a credit card in a transaction or something?
1314755	1315896	I don't think so.
1316016	1316356	Interesting.
1316396	1326538	Because technically, I mean, I could download some free download content or something like that and never had to buy anything, but I'm still out of, you know, the three, four weeks or whatever it was down.
1327058	1329279	What if I share a PlayStation with somebody else?
1329519	1332639	Like, you know, my significant other lives with me and we share an account.
1333200	1334300	I mean, I'm sorry, we don't share an account.
1334320	1336020	We share a PlayStation, but we have two separate accounts.
1336460	1338281	So will I get to get two and he'll get to get the other two?
1338401	1338981	That's what I'm thinking.
1339422	1339723	Nice!
1340626	1341589	Yes, that's what I'm thinking
1344226	1344926	I mean, I could be wrong.
1345166	1346107	Either way, let me put it this way.
1346127	1356770	I mean, I have LittleBigPlanet already, and I would never... I wouldn't want to download it, because I have my really rare LittleBigPlanet with the band music in there.
1358330	1361151	You know, I'd probably pick up Infamous, because that looked pretty good.
1361591	1365632	But the rest of the PlayStation Network games, I just don't really care too much about those.
1366432	1371154	Maybe... I don't know, Dead Nation looked alright, or Wipeout...
1373430	1381685	I really don't care, but if I can pick six titles then I'll probably get everything and then we'll see what Japan has whenever they get around to come back up.
1384787	1387007	See, some other fun stuff Sony related.
1387548	1406091	The PlayStation Network, they had opened up their website for changing your password, and apparently the sign-ins, they've disabled them because they found a potential exploit that people could use to basically hack your account.
1407412	1407732	Awesome.
1408132	1409192	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
1411309	1412150	Okay, now keep reading.
1434890	1444097	Yeah, I guess it allowed people to go some roundabout way to change their password and get access to their account.
1445834	1447195	I don't know.
1448075	1455878	It's very minor and it got fixed pretty quick, but it's just you can't keep making these mistakes.
1456178	1457558	You really got to be on your toes.
1457838	1458739	Oh, wait.
1458779	1461940	I love this comment in our chat room from Islander.
1462620	1464761	By the way, OLR, a lot of people...
1465641	1466341	on home right now.
1466361	1469243	Actually, it's like I3 Linder, but I'm saying... Blender?
1469823	1472265	Oh, it's a little B. Okay, Blender.
1472705	1478288	Blender says, by the way, OLR, a lot of people on home right now are having freezing issues when they get a new item.
1478688	1480569	Some sort of bug since the relaunch.
1481710	1485232	So, home is freezing whenever you get a new item.
1502464	1506246	Hacked and people have started stealing virtual currency.
1506987	1512710	It's, I guess, some Sony run internet service provider called Sonet.
1514431	1520855	They had some virtual points or whatever and people apparently stole roughly 100,000 yen or $1,200 worth of virtual points.
1525806	1530028	And it says no personal information was compromised or any other accounts.
1530588	1534870	But, you know, it's still kind of pathetic that you're having multiple accounts assigned.
1534910	1544614	In fact, there's another story that I don't even think was on here where they had another account, another website that got hacked and became a phishing account now, a phishing website.
1544734	1550617	So, man, Sony is just the Internet's bitch right now.
1551217	1551597	I don't know.
1552158	1552738	It's kind of sad.
1553078	1554499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1570367	1575630	Well, the Japanese government refuses to let Sony relaunch the PlayStation Network there.
1576490	1577991	They haven't given approval for it.
1578371	1588335	And it says, apparently, the Ministry of Economy, Content Industry says the government refused Sony's initiative to...
1591457	1592598	to launch the platform again.
1592618	1600283	It says as of May 13th, Sony was incomplete in exercising measures that they said they will do on the May 1st press conference.
1600924	1604486	It says the details of which the measures haven't been enacted yet were not released.
1605567	1611091	The source added that the government wants clear terms of what Sony is planning on doing to protect its users.
1611131	1617075	Credit card info saying there were similar cases in the past that were caused by other firms and we're asking Sony
1617695	1622598	whether their measures are good enough when compared to countermeasures taken in the past.
1623959	1625120	I mean, that sounds fair enough.
1625360	1627081	That's kind of a big deal.
1627642	1633786	Like, the country's basically saying, no, you're not coming back up because you're not proven that you're secure.
1634086	1639729	And then as we keep hearing all these stories about other facets of the company getting hacked, it's kind of not helping their case.
1639849	1640470	No, it's not.
1642531	1645153	Well, you know why the Roman Empire fell?
1646134	1646714	The Roman Empire?
1649204	1650926	Dreamcast 2 Overlooked
1671184	1674286	Anyhow, let's move on to some more hopeful news.
1674686	1677248	You know, not all the news that comes out of Sony these days is bad.
1677389	1680671	And this could be possibly giving us a sign of some things that we could look forward to at E3.
1680711	1689578	And I gotta say, man, Sony... Sony is gonna have... I mean, I realize Nintendo has just announced that they're showing a new fucking console at E3.
1689899	1692681	But I am still most interested in Sony's prefs conference.
1692821	1693521	I really am.
1693621	1694742	Like, it's either gonna be...
1695643	1700246	The biggest, like, redemption ever, or it's gonna be just the nail in the coffin.
1700387	1704950	Like, there is so much writing on Sony's press conference this year, I can't even, like...
1706491	1706991	Imagine.
1707172	1710334	So I'm really curious to see what their thing looks like.
1710774	1713977	This might be one of the things that they're going to announce at the press conference at E3 this year.
1714958	1722444	Apparently there's a God of War portable collection that is going to be coming out to the PlayStation 3 in Asian regions in July.
1723084	1728989	That's a press release that was sent by Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan and picked up by International Gaming News websites.
1730210	1756089	So apparently the God of War PSP games Chains of Olympus and Ghosts of Sparta are going to be revamped HD Chinese and English language options and will be released on July 7th in Asia And of course a lot of people kind of their minds go well if it's coming out in Asia why the heck isn't it coming out in the rest of the world So this could be something that's being announced In fact And I mean if it's going to be in England or you know if it's coming out in Asia you can import it even if it wasn't coming out right away
1756229	1757230	God of War 3
1780126	1794282	Sony, in fact, unveiled a new initiative this week where certain PlayStation Portable titles will be ported to the PlayStation 3 with improvements made that are, you know, like exactly what we're hearing about the God of War collection.
1794322	1799388	So, in my mind, this confirms the God of War thing because, duh, of course they're going to do the God of War game.
1799408	1800029	They already showed off.
1800509	1801310	Monster Hunter Portable 3
1829108	1833190	The question is, what other games might be included as part of this?
1833230	1837573	What are the other, like, huge PlayStation Portable titles that could be a part of this?
1838934	1840775	Just throwing it out there, maybe Metal Gear Acid?
1842636	1843616	I don't think they would do Acid.
1843636	1845717	I think that they would do the last Metal Gear Solid.
1845737	1846958	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the last one.
1847018	1847298	I'm sorry.
1847338	1847878	Peace Walker.
1847999	1850240	Yeah, Peace Walker could be one, certainly.
1851201	1857407	Well, we'd learn about that pretty quick if that was going to be the case, because Konami would probably announce it during their press conference, which would be the Sunday prior.
1857567	1860811	I'm certainly looking forward to the... Unless they're told not to say that.
1861091	1866697	I'm certainly hoping that those Final Fantasy remakes would be a part of it, although I doubt it.
1867318	1885237	uh that would nah plus I'd be a little bit irritated because I already bought those I would see that maybe uh you know Dissida or um you know oh yeah that I bet that's that's a big one or the other Final Fantasy game the seven spin-off Crisis Core thank you yeah yeah
1885877	1888479	So those are definite contenders from Squeenix, absolutely.
1888859	1892001	And who's to say they couldn't just do some of these as download games?
1892041	1893182	I mean, why not?
1893282	1894583	I mean, that would make sense to me.
1895323	1895784	Absolutely.
1896124	1899366	Maybe the Half Minute Hero games as well.
1899646	1900167	That would be cool.
1903329	1907672	This is all but certain to show up at E3, so it's just a matter of what titles and when.
1907752	1909553	So we'll see what happens with that.
1909901	1919465	And what's great about it, though, is like some of those games, you know, that were kind of, they're just all right, you know, with control-wise because they didn't have a second analog.
1919685	1920566	Well, now we can fix that.
1920706	1921146	That's true.
1922146	1926228	Or that little nub thing that the PSP has kind of starts to wear on your finger.
1926248	1926909	Am I the only one?
1926929	1929570	Like, I can't use that thing for a long period of time because it hurts.
1930250	1932131	Just the texture on that button is yuck.
1933571	1933912	I don't know.
1934672	1937613	I actually had a replacement so I could, you know, put on there.
1938073	1939294	But I never had a problem with it.
1940131	1941011	Alright, I guess it's just me.
1941692	1943352	Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
1943712	1945393	There's some Mortal Kombat news out there.
1945953	1957138	Basically, with the PlayStation 3, you had the Kombat Pass so that you could... You'd have to have it to play online, but you can only, of course, use it while the PlayStation Store is online, which, of course, it wasn't.
1957538	1963500	So it's being waived until everything is pretty much back up full-time.
1964795	1973437	You know, I didn't even really think about that until I had heard about this story because I cashed in my pass because I bought the game the day it came out or I had Amazon deliver it the day it came out.
1973877	1977898	So I cashed in my pass that day and the next day is when PlayStation went down.
1977938	1978879	So I never had a problem.
1978899	1979939	I was able to play online.
1980339	1984800	But it didn't occur to me that, oh yeah, with the store being down, you can't redeem those passes.
1984880	1987501	So if you didn't get this game on launch day, you were screwed.
1988061	1994324	So they're actually waiving the need for the pass until the PlayStation Store is fully operational.
1994504	2006029	And good, that's the right thing to do, but I don't feel sorry for them for the amount of shit they probably got from their fanbase and threatens of lawsuits and so forth, because that's what you get for putting these passes in the game in the first place.
2006109	2007830	It really doesn't just end with Mortal Kombat.
2007870	2009030	This is a growing trend.
2009050	2010631	Capcom, Capcom, Capcom, Capcom.
2011571	2013453	No, actually, you know, here's the thing.
2013513	2015574	Capcom isn't doing that at all.
2016014	2017615	I mean, they're doing that with their download content.
2017635	2018596	They're doing it with their DRM.
2018616	2026961	Well, their DRM with their download content sucks, but they're not one of these companies putting out this, oh, we've got to buy it new in order to play online for free.
2027601	2029242	You know, that's kind of bullshit.
2029343	2034206	THQ, THQ, THQ, and now Warner Brothers is kind of following suit with EA.
2034606	2036367	So those are your evil three right there.
2036607	2037788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2061111	2082229	since the Super Nintendo days to be quite honest honestly I think if what's gonna happen here the whole reason they're doing those online passes anyways is trying to recoup some money they're losing from piracy because if you want to play it online you gotta pay the $10 which some people have no problem doing especially if they've pirated the game but I don't know I still think it's dumb
2083092	2089075	Well, and it's especially dumb that when I am supporting the company and I buy it new that I get locked out.
2090136	2090676	You know what I mean?
2092017	2095178	They realized they probably had to set everything up before they could announce it.
2095718	2099400	I know, but there were certainly a few days there where they probably got a lot of shit from people.
2099420	2100821	I'm just saying they deserved it.
2101101	2106005	Even still though, someone bought that copy at one time, so they already made their sale for it.
2106426	2108067	Why do they need more money after the fact?
2108107	2109408	Because someone else decides to play.
2109629	2113732	That'd be like, oh hey Rob, I watched this DVD once and I'm going to loan it to you.
2114513	2116154	Should the company get money for that?
2116275	2117536	No, because they already bought it once.
2117556	2119157	They already got the money made from that.
2119537	2123241	If they wanted a pay-per-view service or something like that, then they should do something different.
2123641	2133687	Let me go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com TigerClaw in our chat says, Not only that, anyone who bought a game that comes with a code for some DLC in the box, they can't redeem it until the store goes back up.
2134087	2144893	Yeah, like, funny enough, although I redeemed the combat pass, I did not redeem my reptile original outfit that I got for buying the game, but I don't, you know, I'm a little, it's a stupid costume.
2144953	2150937	Like, I'm not, the Barbie features, I'm not so bent out of shape about, you know, it doesn't really impact the game.
2151957	2180568	but I mean it's certainly still a valid point maybe some other games had DLC that were impacted by this so there you go Frisbee in our chat room flat out says DRM is a poison it's such a bummer because I get why companies have to do it I mean obviously piracy is an issue and it is something that has to be dealt with but it just sucks when the people that get affected most by the change is the ones that are trying to do everything legitimately
2182269	2182502	Oh well.
2184073	2184733	It never ends.
2185274	2185654	Moving on.
2185854	2186495	New story, Loki.
2213311	2240957	hmm could possibly maybe I don't know adding DS or DSi download games to the virtual console or whatever they're going to call that because now you'll have your touch screen and your one screen in your controller and your other screen is up on TV but then of course I have to say is why would you spend more money on a controller which I'm assuming is going to be at least a hundred bucks you know when you can buy DS or DSi
2242301	2243216	I'm black
2243755	2243995	Really?
2244015	2250658	Because when I heard about this, I was thinking more of the Kinect-style features, but I guess that doesn't work if it's on a controller, does it?
2250718	2252098	I didn't really think that one through.
2252118	2252959	Let me put it this way.
2253279	2261642	This sounds like this console is going to have gimmicks out the ass.
2261722	2265583	It's like, what possible gimmicks can we throw in on this thing?
2265763	2271566	It's got motion controls, it's got a touchscreen, it's got a camera on it, it's got, you know...
2272686	2279795	Microwave, I mean, what else can we throw on this fucking... I just have to see how they're going to use it because I'm going to tell you this much.
2283531	2287692	All the Nintendo gimmicks that have been out there haven't been that great.
2287772	2289252	I mean, the motion control stuff, yeah.
2289792	2295493	But then you get all these launch games that are all these just waggle this, waggle this when it could have been just a button for all that.
2296734	2304175	Or, you know, just the Zapper or the Wii Fit balance board or Motion Plus.
2304555	2308476	I mean, a lot of it is just rehash, you know, or...
2310137	2313860	Just a gimmicky game that's not really that original.
2313880	2316442	It's just all this extra crap that you don't really need in there.
2316522	2321386	So if they're throwing in all these gimmicks, they gotta be doing something really smart with it.
2321406	2328311	I think the problem why it seems like there's so many gimmicks as well is because we're in that rumor phase where people are just fucking making shit up.
2328351	2331453	And I'm not even sure I totally agree with this rumor.
2331593	2335757	I think it's just somebody making a good odds prediction.
2336357	2337178	Thanks for watching!
2357759	2358420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2379920	2384941	Half the stuff they promise will not make it at launch or at all.
2385121	2387962	I mean, they're going to promise you all this stuff that this console is going to be doing.
2388382	2389862	Oh, yeah, that feature is not done yet.
2389922	2392402	It's not going to be out for six months after the console is released.
2392923	2394143	Like, you know, the 3DS.
2394203	2395163	I mean, come on.
2395563	2397063	That's just stupid.
2397103	2402224	You can't release a console that's halfway done and then your sales are pretty shitty as it is.
2402684	2405905	And then stuff that's promised at the launch of that stuff, you know,
2406845	2434052	it's just delay after delay I'm not quite as negative as Loki is on this issue really Nintendo really only needs to do just a couple things to make me buy the new system as long as it's high definition and capable of pretty graphics and it has a new F-Zero game on it and it has a type of controller that's not quite so gimmicky where maybe I understand there's going to be some gimmick of some sort but as long as we can kind of tone it down a little bit I'll be in I'm fine
2434292	2435573	Even like 2 out of 3 ain't bad.
2435613	2438035	If they don't really give me an F-Zero game, I guess I can't be that upset.
2438095	2439236	But I really want it.
2439837	2441898	I really, really want an F-Zero game.
2442379	2443560	And now would be a perfect time.
2444961	2450245	Unless this whole touch thing ends up actually being true, because I don't know how you'd incorporate that into an F-Zero game.
2450565	2452787	But again, I think the touch thing is utter bullshit.
2453128	2455710	I think it's total bullshit, but I guess we'll see.
2455750	2456290	I could be wrong.
2458332	2458552	Anyhow.
2459761	2460222	360, Sony, Nintendo
2476320	2476820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2494474	2495535	Thanks for watching!
2513619	2514780	At least that's what the rumors say.
2515861	2517642	The official Microsoft statement says,
2538200	2542682	and are proactively reaching out to customers that may be impacted to replace their console.
2543142	2551686	Any Xbox 360 owners receiving this error are encouraged to contact us at xbox.com support contact so we can verify if the console has been impacted.
2552026	2552767	Very interesting.
2553147	2562611	Using that whole fact that they send information over the internet automatically about your console to Microsoft, they're able to tell exactly who's affected by this and send them replacements.
2563652	2564152	Interesting.
2566314	2567274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2593644	2599109	I wonder if it's the original 360s, but they've all Red Ringed by now anyway, so that's why it's such a small number.
2599169	2601571	It is one of the original, I think, drives.
2602371	2606314	One of the, either the Samsung, Hitachi, or the... Interesting.
2606535	2608276	I don't remember the last one there.
2608836	2609337	Toshiba.
2611613	2616196	By the way, also speaking about Xbox 360, PayPal has been rolling out in certain territories.
2616996	2627662	There's an automatic update that was going out, and it's going to certain regions first, and now you can actually use PayPal as a billing option on your console.
2628243	2631384	You can do that for Microsoft Points and other types of marketplace content.
2632525	2633245	Apparently...
2634366	2636208	That has all been rolling out over the past week.
2636228	2638910	I don't remember updating my console, but it might have been done when I was around.
2638950	2642873	They haven't been, like I didn't get an update on Friday for my consoles.
2643474	2645095	So, just certain regions right now.
2645996	2649138	May 27th is when Avatar Connect is scheduled to come out.
2649218	2653902	And that is the, if you are too shy to use voice chat, or I'm sorry, video chat.
2654383	2656024	Because you know your Connect has video chat.
2656064	2660308	But if you want to use fake people instead to chat, you'll be able to do that on the 27th.
2663228	2663669	Interesting.
2664389	2666892	Let's move on with another news story and then we'll get to the release dates.
2667954	2675523	Well, going back to Microsoft, there has been word about something that according to our show role is the Connect Fub Lab.
2676404	2676864	I'm sorry.
2677645	2680849	Sorry, I have fubby fat fingers and I think I meant to type fun.
2681009	2682231	I had to give you a hard time.
2682982	2688146	The Connect Fun Lab might be revealed at E3.
2688986	2697913	They are going to be doing a lot of stuff for the Connect, but there is a source that said that something called Connect Fun Lab is in the works to be revealed there.
2697933	2701335	I'm not really sure what it is.
2701495	2709060	There's also another possible Connect title that's called Connect Me that's on the Australia Classifications Board and has Microsoft as a publisher.
2710001	2711484	Crimson Alliance and Fusion Genesis
2722486	2725149	Fusion Genesis, I know what that is.
2725750	2730115	That's another Fusion Frenzy game.
2730735	2734660	And then Crimson Alliance, that sounds like another Crimson Skies game, which sounds kind of cool.
2735421	2737543	But Fusion Frenzy, no!
2737723	2740727	Crimson Alliance is by Certain Affinity and they did Age of Booty.
2741816	2742697	Oh, well.
2743258	2746641	I still don't know if that's what it is, but... Fusion Frenzy!
2749704	2750405	It's terrible.
2750505	2752006	Don't make another Fusion Frenzy game.
2752026	2752807	They're all terrible.
2753968	2779547	Alright, hopefully that isn't what it is, but I'm a little more worried about Kinect Fun Lab Because I thought that this year was the year we're going to see at E3 what the Kinect can really do Alright, we've seen all the Nintendo rip-offs, now let's see what the Kinect can really do It can really rip off Nintendo now I hear Fun Lab and I think, oh goody, it's a lab full of mini-games Fun, fun, fun, fun
2779947	2780748	or it's all puppies.
2781168	2781968	It's all lab puppies.
2782769	2788453	I hope Fun Lab has to do with genetic mutations of people.
2788493	2789293	Make your own monster.
2789333	2791234	Yes, create your own alien or something.
2791294	2792735	I don't want fucking minigames.
2792815	2794256	Exactly, that would be Fun Lab.
2794356	2796358	And then you make them fight through Xbox Live.
2796598	2797538	Yes, and it's okay.
2797699	2798679	It's all virtual.
2798739	2799380	It's not real.
2800100	2801360	Yeah, there you go.
2801801	2804301	A magic pen gel where I draw with my hands.
2804461	2810403	I smear paint to make creatures like it's a monkey smearing poop on the wall.
2810463	2811324	That would be great.
2811344	2811984	Fun Lab.
2812104	2812764	I would play that.
2812924	2814184	Monkey Poo Fun Lab.
2815585	2816245	I would play that.
2816685	2817526	Monkey Poo Fun Lab.
2818006	2818346	All right.
2819566	2822047	Let's go around the world and look at some release dates.
2823070	2827032	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2841357	2844838	Kung Fu Panda 2, another movie tie-in game.
2845578	2847698	And this one, it's a little weird.
2847818	2850319	They're doing something different on every single platform.
2850699	2853759	The PlayStation 3 game is just a PlayStation 3 game.
2854480	2856960	The Xbox 360 is getting a Kinect game.
2858420	2861921	The Wii is getting a U-Draw game.
2862321	2865362	And then DS is just another regular DS game.
2867302	2882368	so those will be out later this week and then let's see here this is fucking slow today other fun stuff like what?
2883442	2884523	Like this is updating.
2884543	2885644	Like Monkey Pooh Smear.
2885844	2887065	Monkey Pooh Smear, yes.
2887165	2890427	Monkey Pooh Smear is coming out this week on all platforms, including the Atari.
2891768	2892789	Looks very exciting.
2893869	2896411	Now, I'm trying to see what else we have here.
2896431	2900614	It's a really small week, but I know it's more than just those two titles.
2902708	2904369	Come on, cooperate.
2905349	2906230	There we go.
2906350	2908551	Dungeons & Dragons Daggerdale for PC.
2909071	2910071	That's coming out this week.
2910711	2916154	Also, Naughty Bear, the Gold Edition, in case you didn't buy that game.
2916994	2922657	It's coming out now with all the download content at a budget price on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2923637	2925338	NASCAR 2011 on the Wii.
2925778	2928019	I've been delayed a little bit, so now it's finally coming out.
2928619	2946510	Paws and Claws Pampered Pets 2 for Nintendo DS out this week as well and Murder in Venice kind of an adventure game that's also for DS Cake Mania Main Street that's on DS this week and that is pretty much it
2950257	2953279	Well, we have some news for the U.S.
2953359	2956341	For overseas, in the U.K.
2957502	2959103	And it's actually just a few games.
2959524	2965168	On the 24th, we have Dirt 3 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.
2966569	2968890	And we also have Kung Fu Panda for the DS.
2969631	2973373	And on the 27th is Gladiator Begins on the PSP.
2973934	2979278	And on the 30th, we have Fable 3 for PC, which, why it's taking so dang long to come out, oh well, we don't know.
2980158	2980759	But I don't know.
2981900	2985505	Fable 3, I will go ahead and warn our UK viewers.
2985545	2988749	Now, I've got friends that love, when I say viewers, it's listeners.
2989129	2993875	I've got friends that love Fable 3, but it's really not all that great.
2994035	2995457	Fable 2 is so much of a better game.
2996278	2996638	Don't you think?
2999168	3005710	Fable 2 is alright, but Fable 3 didn't look like they added too much stuff to it, so I passed on it.
3007070	3008891	I can't trust anything Peter Molyneux says.
3009351	3010051	He's full of shit.
3011411	3013332	That means he needs to probably go potty.
3014132	3014312	Yes.
3014492	3016152	Except every time he potties a new game comes out.
3017453	3017833	That's true.
3018253	3018373	Yeah.
3020399	3036555	and uh well I have really nothing else on for UK I mean there's they list games but they don't put dates on them like Back to the Future Double Vision is on the list but they didn't put a date on it so that's all and speaking of uh stuff that's coming out
3037148	3038588	Akai Katana Shin Red Katana New Death
3065174	3070358	Here, people discovered a Bloodsword that takes human sacrifices to unleash its mass-destructive power.
3070898	3072259	That would be Redsword Death, then.
3073139	3075381	Now, this is an existing game that's already been out.
3075421	3080384	The 360 version will have new stages, new characters, and a new system, and the graphics will fit in a 16.9.
3080424	3084947	So I'm assuming this is a prior PlayStation 2 release.
3085367	3088710	So that is coming out this week, and it's a shooter.
3088870	3089710	Of course, it's a shooter.
3089730	3090091	It's Cave.
3090111	3090631	What did you expect?
3090971	3091672	Warrior's Legend of Troy
3109088	3110969	Dynasty Warriors, but with the Trojan horse.
3112090	3113771	Not the Trojan condoms, but the Trojan horse.
3114752	3116013	That would be a whole other type of game.
3116813	3126741	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Hiro no Kakira Aizoban Akane Hiro no Suyoku comes out this week from Idea Factory in regular and limited edition.
3127461	3130443	And this game is an adventure game.
3131044	3132305	I'm trying to see what it is.
3134423	3135003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3150228	3151330	Well, yeah, it looks like every other.
3153273	3156699	Infamous goes into the best series, meaning it gets a price reduction.
3157159	3160084	Nobunaga, Noyabu, Tendo, and a power-up kit.
3160164	3161366	Woo-hoo, come out this week.
3161667	3162729	That's $124 if you want both of those to import.
3166224	3174571	Also, Totori no Atelier, Arland no Rekken Jushutsu 2 goes into the Best Hits collection as well.
3175551	3176912	So some price reductions this week.
3178173	3180615	Going to the Nintendo systems, taking a look real quick.
3181196	3186460	Nintendo Wii, Pandora's Tower, Until I Return to Your Side comes out on the Wii this week.
3186760	3190483	And of course I hear Pandora and I go, wait a minute, wasn't it what they call the Kid Icarus games over in Japan?
3191323	3195125	Pandora's... I thought this was called Pandora's Adventure or something like that.
3195165	3196566	Wasn't Kid Icarus called that in Japan?
3198467	3200048	But that is not what this is.
3200388	3201989	It is not like a Kid Icarus game.
3202029	3203490	It's some other type of game on the Wii.
3203990	3206531	And it's in a black box instead of a white Wii box.
3207212	3207832	So, ooh.
3208932	3209293	Let's see.
3209393	3211954	Going on to the Nintendo 3DS.
3212574	3215716	One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP comes out this week.
3216937	3218758	And lastly, going to the PSP.
3221078	3229546	Shutsugeki, Kid Icarus, Hikari Shinwa, Palthena no Kagami, Light Myth, Palthena's Mirror
3244100	3256789	Anyhow, the game I was reading on the PSP, Shutsugeki Otomatashi no Senjo 2, comes out from System Soft this week on the PSP.
3257529	3263033	And this is a strategy game that involves anime chicks in hot outfits.
3263233	3265915	And then, like, okay, look at these screenshots, okay?
3266355	3268397	You get, like, hot anime babe, right?
3268697	3271519	And then you have, like, anime babes in, like, little maid outfits, right?
3272019	3272400	And then it's...
3273160	3275701	Driving in the streets with tanks and airplanes.
3277762	3279924	This is a very manly sort of game.
3280744	3283545	Hot anime babes and then tanks and fighter jets.
3285206	3285526	Awesome.
3286727	3287688	Pre-ordering it today.
3289348	3289628	All right.
3290629	3295351	Let's move on and go over a couple more news stories, and we'll get into the classic game of the week.
3295872	3300014	DarkSakura's picked a very popular series tonight, so we'll get to that.
3300514	3300754	All right.
3301254	3301915	For now, though, Loki.
3302725	3303005	Ah, yes.
3304286	3318796	So, this is kind of disappointing, because this was actually a game I was looking forward to checking out once the delayed Nintendo Store for the 3DS was released.
3319456	3322978	Oh, but yes, like all things delayed, there are more delays.
3323359	3328182	And Mega Man Legends 3 Prototype Version, a demo for a game that's not even finished yet...
3329164	3333927	will be delayed from the 3DS eShop launch on June 6th.
3337169	3337930	That is terrible.
3338530	3346756	And they haven't really said yet when it's going to be released, but I guess you have to wait.
3353447	3366295	This is for that demo, basically, of the potential Mega Man Legends 3 game that might come out should enough people pay to get this demo concept of what it could possibly be.
3369577	3378139	Oh, well, you know, we may make this game, but you have to pay for this demo, and we may, we'll see.
3378399	3380179	To be honest, I'll probably buy it anyway.
3380439	3380999	Yeah.
3381139	3393702	As long as, okay, here's my little stipulation, I guess we won't really know, because of course we're not going to get told, but my wish is as long as the game I'm not buying here in the DS shop ends up being a part of the actual full game.
3394382	3398586	I do not want to be paying for what will be the first two chapters of the retail release.
3398726	3402850	A side story or a leading into game, those are fine.
3402870	3405112	A case zero is perfectly acceptable.
3405192	3405733	That's fine.
3406233	3409416	But I don't want something that's just going to end up being the first chapter of the game.
3410797	3415441	Capcom was also behind the Dead Rising case zero, which was actually a pretty cool little idea.
3415962	3418364	So my hope is they're going to get this one right too.
3418484	3420306	I'm not going to hold my breath.
3422094	3424657	LA Noire is a game that a lot of people are talking about this week.
3424857	3428442	And it's a very kind of different sort of rock star game from what I understand.
3428482	3431265	People are going into it expecting 1940s Grand Theft Auto.
3431285	3432747	That's not quite what they're getting.
3433528	3435650	But the game seems to be pretty well received.
3436091	3439815	Unless you're one of these people that are affected by the overheating.
3440436	3448385	Apparently, firmware 3.61 on the PlayStation 3 is causing certain Sony consoles to overheat when playing L.A.
3448445	3448845	Noire.
3449306	3452108	This is according to Rockstar's own customer support.
3452749	3453029	Quote,
3461278	3488746	mostly on older 60 and 80 gig fat models oh shit I have one of these models primary reports seem to be that updating to firmware 361 will cause playstations to overheat there have been various reports of this on a few different games now all reporting their playstation 3's turning off or red lighting after having installed 3.6.1 or 3.61 excuse me yikes well now if you're an xbox fanboy pointing and laughing and kicking sony while they're down hold it
3489426	3490847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3509396	3515180	There are reported instances that Microsoft's system is having issues with this as well.
3515420	3523465	Rockstar, of course, was blaming Sony originally, but now that the Xbox stuff is coming to light, they've changed a little bit.
3523525	3524606	Here's their latest statement.
3525386	3530970	We've received a very small number of customer support questions about PS3s overheating or shutting down while playing L.A.
3531030	3531370	Noire.
3532110	3535632	At this time, Rockstar Games and Sony can confirm that neither L.A.
3535692	3537153	Noire or firmware update 3.61...
3538454	3540455	are causing the PS3 hardware to overheat.
3540855	3545236	We are both committed to working hard to find solutions to this and any issues that may arise.
3545736	3550898	Well, if that isn't the vaguest fucking thing I've ever heard, it's not the game and it's not the system.
3551198	3554459	And there's really nothing else between that that would cause your system to overheat.
3554879	3559120	It's just you is really what I'm hearing in that statement.
3559561	3561441	It's not the system and it's not the game.
3561501	3562801	It's just you.
3562962	3563382	It's not me.
3563522	3563782	It's you.
3566400	3568622	I mean, what the fuck kind of press release is that?
3569703	3574147	Why not say, we recognize the problem and we are working on a solution?
3575469	3576730	Oh my god, how hard was that?
3578952	3579372	Very hard.
3579392	3581895	It's not like Sony hasn't got bigger problems right now.
3583396	3586239	Ugh, this is more just that corporate bullshit.
3586279	3587160	Like, stop it.
3588081	3590002	Just be real with the consumers.
3590363	3591484	We see through your crap.
3593703	3594063	Yikes.
3594884	3600347	We need to go back into a time when gaming wasn't so full of such asshattery and bullshit.
3600907	3603548	And it's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
3605849	3612433	Where we turn back the clock, take a stroll down memory lane, and find a classic game in the archives that DarkSakura says, Hey!
3613700	3614460	Listen up, brats.
3615261	3616622	You should be playing this game.
3617482	3619663	Or I'll set your PlayStation 3 on fire myself.
3619703	3620784	You won't even need Ellie anymore.
3621024	3624826	I'll have my engineers invent combustible lemons that'll burn your PS3 down.
3625166	3625706	There you go.
3626106	3627647	What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
3628068	3628348	Mother.
3631649	3640094	Mother is, uh... Well, as we all know, is the precursor to Mother 2, which came out over here as Earthbound.
3641635	3642175	Now, um...
3643975	3646645	This was... It came out on the Famicom.
3647809	3649154	And it came out in...
3651212	3654533	I'm trying to find the year and it doesn't list the year on here.
3654553	3654533	1989.
3654733	3655534	Yeah, 1989.
3656034	3656254	Sorry.
3657255	3660316	And it was actually published by Nintendo.
3660596	3666338	It was produced by Miyamoto and written by Shigesato Itoi.
3666738	3670220	So it has some fantastic names behind it.
3670820	3675082	It was developed by Ape and Panic Softica and Nintendo Tokyo.
3676952	3677773	Thank you for watching!
3696505	3697445	They localized that.
3698086	3704928	So there is an official localized prototype of the game, and that was actually put out by DemiForce.
3705008	3713111	They used the ROM data that was from the prototype, and it's being put out as Earthbound Zero.
3713611	3714532	And that actually made it out in 1998.
3717508	3722712	The game itself has field maps and a battle system.
3723433	3726996	It doesn't use an overworld map.
3728437	3733881	It just basically... Sorry, my throat's getting messed up.
3734341	3734601	Ninten
3756391	3779721	So when you are on the field map, because like I said, it doesn't have an overall map, just has field maps, you will be attacked by enemies, and then you go into battle mode, where it's a first-person view, and you attack the creature or whatever, like a lamp, through the different menu system commands, and you have different actions for different characters.
3781081	3782102	And you also...
3784557	3789598	can do different moves in order that are based on the character's speed statistics.
3789698	3792319	And you also, of course, get experience and level up that way.
3794419	3799460	And if you lose all of your hit points, then you go to the hospital and you have to pay to revive your characters.
3801941	3811602	And if every character dies, you don't lose your progress, but you go back to the last area that you saved at with only an intent alive and half of your money.
3813003	3814143	So that's kind of crappy, huh?
3815333	3816654	So at any rate... That's harsh.
3817215	3824881	That sounds harder than the pirated version of Earthbound where it would delete your own saved game when you got to the last boss.
3824901	3825362	Remember that?
3825862	3826123	Yeah.
3826943	3828805	Oh, after doubling the difficulty?
3831300	3839203	At any rate, the game talks about a married couple in America who vanished after a dark shadow covered their town.
3840123	3844345	Two years later, George, the husband, returns mysteriously.
3845686	3850527	And then he starts studying in complete seclusion and his wife Maria is never heard from again.
3851308	3859731	So you fast forward to 1988 where there's a 12-year-old boy named Minton who is attacked by a paranormal event.
3861773	3862074	SmartKid
3876835	3884438	So at any rate, he finds out that an invading race is, an alien race is, you know, invading.
3885138	3894542	And so they go to the world of Magicant where the ruler there, Queen Mary, asks Nintendo to find her a song called The Eight Melodies and play it to her.
3894822	3895703	Play all the songs to her.
3896783	3903086	So he meets up with a dude named Lloyd and a girl named Anna.
3904366	3905607	And she dreamed about him.
3905627	3906167	Ooh.
3906807	3908248	So that's the start of the game.
3908528	3912711	And you keep, you know, going through and you duel some dude named Teddy.
3914612	3917934	And, uh... You have to, uh...
3919552	3941491	It's actually funny because you have to, um, the queen tells you about an alien named, I'm hoping that I'm pronouncing this right, but I think it's Gigu, that's spelled G-Y-I-Y-G or something, but it's Gigu, which is actually the same way it was initially romanized for Earthbound in the unreleased translation.
3941511	3941771	Okay.
3942772	3946958	So, it pretty much, you know, more fun, going saving the universe.
3947979	3953707	And the game actually did get a re-release in 2003 with Mother 2.
3955489	3959174	And the tagline was, No Crying Until the End and a Guaranteed Masterpiece.
3961517	3969286	So it was actually designed by a Japanese copywriter and television personality, Shigesato Itoi.
3970047	3972810	And the inspiration for the game was from John Lennon's young mother.
3973451	3976554	And he also wanted the game to have a name that wasn't game-like.
3977275	3978457	I didn't know that part.
3978497	3979177	That's interesting.
3980183	4009621	and I like this quote here it said that the last parts of Mother were not tested for bugs and balance issues and when talking about it at a promotional event he humorously stated when we got to fine tuning the difficulty there I was like whatever so yeah there's a lot of people and I've started playing it a while back but never really got too much further into it who says this is a game that you have to grind and grind and grind and grind to get through
4011534	4013456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4034212	4048955	Phil Sandhop, who said, and I'm quoting, once the NES squatted in the pipeline and shoved the game aside from its appointed time, I believe that the marketing execs just decided that the game would be too expensive to produce and unsuccessful without marketing, and that's why it fell into oblivion.
4050605	4056809	They were doing a lot of stuff in localization, which was removing blood from enemy sprites, which was a censorship thing they had at the time.
4057809	4060031	And they were going to extend the game's ending.
4061151	4069697	So at any rate, Demiforce, as I mentioned before, found a beta cartridge on the internet, and they collected enough money to buy the game.
4070617	4071938	I remember when that happened.
4072018	4073559	I was in college and that was all going on.
4075163	4084847	And so they actually had to do modified versions with the copy protection disabled and renamed it Earthbound Zero so that it could separate it from Earthbound.
4086147	4092470	And they actually put everything out.
4092490	4095811	I mean, I thought it was neat that they bought the rights to do it.
4095931	4097332	So that was pretty cool.
4099186	4105588	The music in it was done by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka.
4106448	4112050	And it was actually released on CD and cassette by Sony on August 21st, 1989.
4112130	4113030	And it had 11 tracks.
4113950	4115251	And 7 of them are vocal remakes.
4119532	4121893	So it's got the eight melodies on there, one called Pollyanna.
4123034	4133678	And actually, on February 18, 2004, the soundtrack was re-released, digitally remastered, and songs from it appear in EarthBound, Mother 3, Super Smash Bros.
4133718	4134799	Melee, and Super Smash Bros.
4134839	4135099	Brawl.
4137620	4139261	So there's actually some pretty...
4141673	4146235	Big names that were included with the CD, including the St.
4146255	4147975	Paul's Cathedral Choir.
4149236	4159279	It sold 400,000 copies in Japan, and in two polls by Famitsu, it was the 9th best game for the Famicom and the 38th best game of all time.
4160020	4167022	It was the 4th most-won virtual console game in June 2008, according to Nintendo Power, and moved up to the 2nd most-wanted.
4168496	4171439	So, it was called Dark and Mature.
4172720	4173280	And that's the game.
4174201	4175602	Alright, your classic game of the week.
4176163	4177684	Mother or Earthbound Zero?
4178164	4179305	The Original.
4180066	4181027	Most folks in the U.S.
4181067	4181607	have never seen.
4181787	4182007	Yep.
4182588	4182828	Alright.
4184349	4184830	Good pick.
4185090	4185891	That's a great series.
4185951	4187772	And, you know, that series had a lot of rabid fans.
4187852	4191295	It does seem ridiculous that Nintendo really just kind of let it die.
4191736	4195339	I mean, I think I get some of the reasons behind it, but I don't know.
4195459	4195639	Like...
4196420	4201444	It was a pretty cute little RPG franchise that Nintendo had, and it's just kind of a bummer that they couldn't work around some of that.
4201464	4213836	I understand maybe why things can't be re-released, but it's a bummer they can't get the same kind of concept and the whole modern RPG thing and kind of make it work with the new game.
4214097	4217160	But maybe some things are just left better as classics.
4217940	4220141	Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a break.
4220221	4221202	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4221262	4224983	We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a break.
4226124	4229485	Coming up after the break, we've got stories about Portal 2.
4230065	4232706	Apparently, some folks find that game highly offensive.
4232726	4235047	We're going to talk about who and why in a little while.
4235988	4239349	Some other Portal 2 news and E3 news already starting to come in.
4239789	4242550	How you can actually go to one of the press conferences.
4242570	4245772	We're going to talk a little bit about that when we come back after a quick break.
4246472	4247533	Orange Lounge Radio
4269474	4271015	We're going to get into those in just a minute.
4271055	4275716	But first, some quick plugs for some other projects that we do, which we actually referenced already at the top of the show.
4275776	4277236	But we're going to sell them again.
4277617	4278297	Because you know what?
4278337	4281418	We don't really advertise anything on this show except our other shows.
4281498	4283879	So here's your commercial.
4284239	4285079	DarkSakura, what's your show?
4285578	4291500	Comic Insanity, which is at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.
4292421	4298943	And we talk about comics, but we also have a new segment where we talk about a classic comic of the week.
4299624	4307687	And we also have what Shadow calls the Random Encounter, which is talking about an old RPG.
4309422	4310503	Classic RPG.
4311163	4313003	Very cool.
4313183	4315224	Throwing a little video game spin in your comic show.
4315524	4315944	A little bit.
4316665	4318185	You're trying to leave us, aren't you?
4318205	4320146	No, never, never, never, never, never.
4321006	4322886	This is my big baby.
4324467	4327848	Your big nine-year-old crying bratty baby that says shit a lot.
4328703	4331767	Yes, gonna have to wash this mouth out with some lye soap.
4333108	4340137	Anyway, but yeah, we talk comics and it's me and Maureen Marvel and Dan Shadow and we're awesome!
4340677	4342059	Listen to us, we go live every Tuesday.
4342563	4370171	Alright, if you like the WoW chat that we do at the top of the show sometimes during our gaming weeks there's a whole other show I have with my buddy Extover all about the World of Warcraft it's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth www.hordehouse.com and I promise you this week actually, well, the show that's on the feed right now because we tape Thursdays and we post Thursday night the show that's on the feed right now is the one with DarkSakura on it so it's a great episode I promise on this week's show
4370831	4375154	There's going to be a shocking revelation that I'm going to get tons of shit for.
4376095	4377957	It's going to be a hatin' on Rob episode.
4378437	4378918	Guess what?
4379038	4379218	What?
4379358	4382100	Also, I was in my pajamas the entire time.
4382160	4383001	It was awesome.
4384362	4384702	Awesome.
4385423	4388205	So, HordeHouse.com if you want more information like that.
4388305	4392829	No, I have not quit WoW and I have not resigned my account, so get those thoughts out of your head.
4392889	4397392	I always threaten to do it whenever Blizzard does something that pisses me off, but I have yet to.
4397833	4399014	So, it's not that.
4399676	4405098	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news and then we'll get into the Twitter topics after that.
4405138	4409539	Some quick stories that we want to throw at you, although we don't have a whole lot of time to discuss them.
4409959	4410219	Loki.
4411419	4416321	Yes, No More Heroes, Heroes Paradise is coming August 16th.
4417581	4418722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4443522	4447545	Maybe a new Carmageddon being announced at E3 this year.
4448045	4454190	Coming from Square Enix, apparently they have a countdown on the Carmageddon.com website.
4455051	4459615	And it is counting down to June 1st, so maybe an announcement...
4460476	4463078	It's so weird, because when I think of Squeenix, I don't think of Carmageddon.
4463098	4472966	I think of role-playing games and dudes with big hair, but I keep forgetting, oh yeah, they have Eidos now, and that's where the Tomb Raider comes from and all that other stuff, so it's interesting.
4473727	4482274	And then finally, if you have a homebrew-enabled PSP, there's some pretty cool stuff you can do with that, including the PSP 3D plugin version 2.0.
4482575	4483736	It's been released.
4484096	4487499	It enables 3D for select PSP games.
4488239	4494723	And this is of course the old school cyan red glasses that you can wear.
4495203	4497805	And you can actually play quite a few games in 3D.
4497845	4504249	They've just added support for Crisis Core, God Eater Burst, FIFA 11, and the third birthday.
4506030	4509612	And there's a pretty extensive list of games that actually are supported by it.
4510872	4516196	Despicable Me, Ape Escape, Ridge Racer 2, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, Grip Shift...
4518337	4520961	Lots of big titles.
4521081	4524084	Oh, Dead to Rights Reckoning, Star Wars Battlefront, Elite Squadron.
4524304	4525806	A little bit of a mix of everything.
4527508	4528930	Including Eye of Judgment Legends.
4531246	4533227	Still won't sell them all the copies.
4533247	4537270	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandrea.com Dungeon Buster says, Carmageddon was so fun.
4537330	4540132	And Amiga777 says, Carmageddon was Eidos' baby.
4540472	4541313	No, not necessarily.
4541373	4544175	It's just that when I think of Squeenix, I don't really think of Carmageddon.
4544195	4545536	I think of role-playing games and stuff.
4545556	4551680	And I realize they've done some other stuff throughout their history that wasn't quite like that, but I just, I don't know, I think of the other stuff.
4551720	4555343	But then Eidos is kind of the company that
4555663	4556844	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4579165	4580406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4605439	4610824	I don't know if that's just they had a lot of paint to polish on it, or maybe they decided to do more with it than they had originally.
4611264	4611725	Who knows?
4611865	4616228	But the iPad version of the game will come out a little bit later than the iPhone version.
4616529	4618611	This is because of the higher resolution.
4619211	4624316	Square does say one thing they are doing, redoing some of the artwork for the higher resolution.
4624356	4626097	So that's pretty awesome, actually.
4626237	4627799	So take a look at that.
4628999	4633701	Alan Wake is apparently getting a new game on Xbox Live Arcade.
4633761	4634861	It's not quite what you'd think.
4634901	4636142	It's not like a sequel or anything.
4636462	4638843	But it's a game called Alan Wake's Night Springs.
4639303	4641104	This is a rumor right now.
4641164	4642604	It's nothing that's been confirmed.
4642704	4643284	But I don't know.
4643304	4644185	This makes a lot of sense.
4644325	4645125	Alan Wake was a pretty...
4645485	4646186	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
4665319	4673506	Alan Wake really reminds me of Twin Peaks, but as a video... And when I say Twin Peaks, like the old show from 1990 with Kyle MacLachlan and David Lynch was the guy behind it, right?
4673546	4674326	Who killed Laura Palmer.
4674887	4676468	Alan Wake kind of really reminds me of that a lot.
4676568	4678490	And Twin Peaks had a show within a show.
4678510	4680351	It was called like Ticket to Love or something like that.
4680712	4684275	It was like the soap opera within the show that would explain some of the things that are actually going on.
4684635	4686276	Well, Alan Wake has something just like that.
4686997	4687677	Night Springs.
4687858	4688958	So I guess that...
4689779	4691400	Show within a game is getting a spin-off.
4691600	4692841	That's kind of neat, I guess.
4693221	4695803	Well, it'd have a show within a show.
4696724	4698025	It is not Alan Wake 2.
4698645	4701347	It is not more download content for the first game.
4701761	4704142	So whatever this is, it is something new.
4704643	4705223	So that's pretty cool.
4706424	4715789	Coming from Capcom, we've talked about Monster Hunter on the PS3, but now Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting is coming to the iOS systems.
4716710	4718331	Capcom did announce it for June.
4718391	4721673	Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting, it's coming out for the iOS devices.
4722233	4724194	A new intuitive control system.
4724554	4726355	It will not use the typical D-pad.
4726515	4730958	Hooray, because I hate D-pad translations on the iPhone, because there is no D-pad on the iPhone.
4731379	4732180	So that'll be kind of cool.
4732240	4735387	You can use horizontal slashes and vertical slashes.
4735447	4736971	Kind of a whole different little way of doing it.
4737652	4739476	Probably more information to come at E3.
4740518	4741099	So, there you go.
4742383	4743863	Well, how about some rock band news, too?
4744724	4746304	There's some Lady Gaga, Rob.
4747445	4754127	On this new download content pack is going to be Lady Gaga Pack 02.
4754967	4757027	Born This Way, Love Game, and Paparazzi.
4757488	4760188	And there's also a couple of... Excuse me.
4760228	4761449	Didn't mean to burp on the mic.
4762589	4770434	There also will be a pro guitar upgrade for Alice in Chains Roosters and the White Stripes, Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.
4771074	4775356	And two individual songs that are by Foreigner, Hot-Blooded and Urgent.
4776717	4778518	So, those are in there.
4779299	4781600	And then there is Super Street Fighter 4.
4781920	4785142	Sorry, I always love an excuse to be able to play Lady Gaga on the show.
4789312	4790614	Come on, DarkSakura, sing along.
4790915	4792657	Let's hear the voice.
4796944	4798647	Don't be afraid of your voice, DarkSakura.
4798687	4799929	You were born this way, baby.
4800430	4800770	Later.
4802373	4803054	I'm not drunk yet.
4805386	4830960	Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition is going to be coming to Steam and they had some issues bringing it out for the PC but now it's going to be on Steam and it will be $40 there are pre-orders available too and there's not going to be though any download content for Super Street Fighter Super Vanilla Street Fighter 4 I should say but the game will have a 10% discount for the Super Arcade Edition bringing it down to $36
4832734	4833134	Yay!
4834695	4842101	And the last of my batch of news is Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 has a release date.
4843281	4844462	That's in Europe, by the way.
4844562	4846244	It will be on July 1st.
4846924	4849446	So it's basically all the mobile suits.
4849566	4861414	You have 50 playable and upgradable characters, 70 playable and upgradable mecha, or the mobile suits, I should say, including the mobile suit Gundam 00 and mobile suit Gundam UC.
4862535	4867777	You also have three new gameplay systems that are Partner Strike, Emergency Dash, and Recovery Gauge.
4868577	4869057	So there you go.
4870997	4871718	Gundam.
4872118	4872798	Gundam.
4874238	4876599	So I hate to bring it back to Lady Gaga.
4876639	4877079	No, you don't.
4877119	4878140	No, this is an important question.
4878200	4878760	It's very important.
4878780	4879200	No, you don't.
4879720	4883401	And I apologize to the haters out there as well, but this is actually related to technology.
4883701	4886462	Did you see the commercial for Google Chrome with her in it?
4886642	4887582	I don't watch TV, Rob.
4887942	4888903	Well, it's on the internet.
4889063	4889863	It's all over YouTube.
4890003	4891264	I love how you're totally using Yiddish now.
4891284	4891444	I know.
4916139	4918108	Talk amongst yourselves.
4918510	4919393	I'll give you a topic.
4920874	4925197	Lady Gaga, neither Gaga nor a lady, if certain rumors are to be believed.
4927058	4927678	That was great.
4927898	4928158	All right.
4929539	4942987	But yeah, no, like the, and there's a Google Chrome commercial for, it's like a guy who, and you keep seeing the search box fill in with these different terms, like how to speak French, plane ticket to Paris.
4943087	4946549	And it's like, the whole thing is about like a long distance relationship and how Google like helps them.
4946849	4948010	Like, what is a truffle?
4948030	4948110	Yeah.
4949011	4952515	It's really adorable and like, oh my god, Google does like the best commercials.
4952535	4955458	I like people tell me that Chrome is a good... You know what?
4956219	4962125	I upgraded to Firefox 4 and my personal opinion is that it's absolute and utter fucking shit.
4962426	4968052	Like, it has slowed down my computer, certain websites are bored, Instagram, Firefox 4 is shit.
4968072	4969814	See, Firefox 4 hasn't done anything...
4970394	4972095	Firefox 3 is fine.
4972195	4975856	I was a huge Firefox fan and supporter up until version 4, which is crap.
4976196	4977277	I have switched to Chrome.
4977417	4978377	I will now never look back.
4978817	4982939	Because I did Chrome in the very beginning, and I was like, this is kind of crap.
4983399	4984620	But now Chrome is great.
4984720	4987601	See, none of my stuff's been borked with the upgrade.
4987641	4988821	I still use my Fire FTP.
4988861	4989462	I use everything.
4990442	4998524	Anyway, by the way, since we did talk about Lady Gaga's involvement, do you know that George Takei has a video out now?
4999644	5001244	Oh, the It's Okay to Be Takei?
5001404	5002565	It's Okay to Be Takei.
5002705	5005485	Well, that whole law in, what is it?
5005505	5005905	Kentucky?
5006165	5009966	Wherever, but fuck, place it is.
5010106	5011126	Haha, lol, not anymore.
5011246	5013027	Bend over.
5013167	5013267	It's...
5014847	5016609	I've decided that I want him to be my gay daddy.
5016629	5017009	For real, me too.
5017029	5018090	He should be all of our gay daddies.
5018110	5018230	I know.
5018250	5020813	And then whenever we... Logan, don't you want George Takei as your gay daddy?
5020833	5020913	No.
5036542	5041043	And then when we're naughty, he goes, oh my, you've been naughty.
5041584	5042264	Oh, God.
5042684	5045145	Him and Betty White need a buddy comedy.
5046165	5046865	Oh, my.
5047905	5050166	Don't George Takei and Betty White need a buddy comedy?
5050186	5050686	Yes, they do.
5050726	5051466	Oh, my God.
5052147	5053187	I would be their opening day.
5053547	5054368	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5073460	5078443	And he really does have just like a sexy voice, especially considering his age.
5078643	5079944	And he always has had.
5080044	5080485	God.
5081365	5084367	He has a voice that could melt like.
5086108	5087129	He has a voice that.
5087269	5089470	You hear his voice and your panties come off, right?
5094853	5095574	I'm getting a look.
5097536	5102162	I'm trying to think of what a super dense metal is that's hard to melt because he could melt it.
5102683	5104044	He could make steam out of it.
5106098	5107238	Anyway, how did we get on this subject?
5107298	5108499	Oh yeah, and that Kentucky Law?
5108559	5109359	Total bullshit.
5109619	5110039	Come on.
5110079	5111179	But it's okay to be TK.
5112239	5112739	I want the mug.
5113620	5115580	Because I love the little Star Trek emblem on it, all in rainbow.
5115640	5116240	It's awesome.
5116780	5117680	I didn't even see that.
5117720	5119661	I kind of want one.
5119781	5120961	My birthday's coming up, just saying.
5121001	5125242	The website is itsoktobtk.org or .com or something.
5125282	5126522	Anyway, we got on a tangent.
5126582	5127102	Sorry about that.
5127142	5127522	I know.
5127582	5128203	Tangent train.
5128643	5130363	And Loki's like, I'm doing other stuff.
5130649	5132169	Hey, don't forget about the asexual people too.
5158223	5159364	I totally missed my reference.
5159404	5160245	That's probably a good thing.
5160365	5160625	I know.
5160925	5163827	Let's move on with the Twitter topics for tonight.
5163887	5166409	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5166890	5167971	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
5170833	5174195	I'm actually being rude and I'm like totally ignoring chat comments right now.
5174235	5175036	Sorry, chatters.
5175076	5178679	I was just, I was really into the whole George and Betty buddy comedy talk.
5178919	5182082	Kai Judo in the chat room says George and Betty should have a podcast.
5183189	5184310	Absolutely they should.
5185110	5185391	Let's see.
5185831	5192255	TigerClaw says, George Takei may be best known for Star Trek, but he made a contribution to Star Wars doing a voice for an episode of The Clone Wars.
5192695	5193276	I didn't know that.
5193776	5199440	Bob Coffee says, I wanted the powers to be, or that be, to make that Sulu Excelsior series happen.
5199500	5200441	It would have been a win.
5201181	5205404	I love that George Takei is involved with the Star Trek fandom the way he is.
5205584	5206264	He just gets it.
5207445	5208226	He's just awesome.
5208926	5209487	Alright, moving on.
5211628	5212469	Twitter topics.
5215151	5217413	Let's go to the first Twitter topic tonight.
5217453	5225219	This is from, and I'm horribly going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize in advance, but it's Ramaditya Knight sends us his first tweet.
5225739	5232845	It's me playing Scars of Time with my flute, and we're linked to a YouTubey, and this better not be a Rickroll.
5233126	5233766	All right, it's not.
5233786	5235107	All right, let's see.
5235648	5236568	Let's play a little clip of this.
5236628	5239231	I want to see one of our listeners playing Scars of Time on the flute.
5239271	5240752	Let me fast forward a little bit here.
5247734	5248234	Not bad!
5251676	5255258	Now this is not like a sideways flute, this is like a pan flute.
5255298	5257339	No, he's playing on the tin whistle.
5259240	5260020	It's very authentic.
5260280	5260861	Yeah.
5260881	5261761	That's awesome.
5268508	5271050	I don't know what the setup is for this video.
5271110	5274292	It looks like he's in a classroom or something.
5274352	5277995	There's some lady holding the mic there.
5278395	5280037	And this camera person is making me dizzy.
5280117	5281578	They just turned the thing sideways.
5282018	5282398	Very good.
5282418	5283199	I love that theme.
5283479	5283880	Oh, God.
5283940	5285781	That's a great video game song.
5285841	5295448	If you don't know Scars of Time, you need to pause this podcast and go onto YouTube and either look at this guy's rendition or go just find the original song like ASAP.
5296149	5296389	Anyhow.
5299510	5304873	Moving on to some other tweets here from SSJ100 Matt.
5306174	5307675	I heard about this earlier in the week too.
5307695	5308615	Let's see what you guys think of this.
5309015	5312217	You know what sucks up the most internet bandwidth in the US?
5312717	5313918	DarkSakura, did you hear this story?
5314738	5315659	Then let me have you guess.
5315739	5319721	What do you think takes up the most internet bandwidth of anything?
5321181	5322681	Loki, I'm assuming you heard this one.
5323142	5325122	Okay, so DarkSakura, since she didn't read it.
5325142	5328003	Well, if we want to go with all of the hype, I would say Illegal Downloads.
5329703	5331784	That's a really good guess, actually, probably.
5332084	5332664	What about AFTA?
5332704	5334364	What legal thing do you think takes up the most bandwidth?
5334584	5338706	Like, if there's one particular site that's eating up more bandwidth than anybody else, who do you think it is?
5338886	5339246	YouTube.
5340886	5344987	Both good guesses, but actually, the most bandwidth in the U.S.
5345207	5347708	is Netflix on video game consoles right now.
5348068	5348208	Huh.
5348622	5352684	S2100 Matt links us to an article about that Netflix is the top user of bandwidth.
5369131	5380894	On the internet, nearly 20% of peak hour downstream traffic in North America is used for streaming video over Netflix through a home video game console representing the most usage of any source.
5381234	5385996	That's a testament to how fast this whole technology and the game console stuff picked on.
5386036	5390777	And you know, game consoles are selling for the mere fact that you can use them as instant Netflix boxes.
5391437	5398663	Don't lie to yourself that this isn't a selling point for a lot of 360s and PlayStations and Wii's of the... Excuse me.
5399604	5400285	Hiccups are killer.
5400585	5401966	And Wii's of the world, you know?
5401986	5408652	Nintendo really had to get on with Netflix with the whole Wii, and I'm sure their next console will be on it as well.
5409052	5409192	So...
5410333	5417317	The three game consoles that support Netflix, the Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, accounted for the majority of that usage.
5417437	5426501	When combined, consoles accounted for 66.3% of the figure, or 19.7% of overall downstream usage.
5427762	5428582	That's crazy.
5429343	5429783	There you go.
5430103	5434205	And no, Amiga, it's not porn that is taking up the most bandwidth.
5434925	5435886	That's a really good guess, though.
5437394	5437895	Let's see.
5438055	5439575	Moving on to some other tweets.
5439916	5448860	DJ Ranma S tweets us and says, Hey, if you go to www.freeplayday.com, you can get a free $10 play at Dave & Buster's.
5449620	5453202	Boy, I just did a total commercial for some website.
5453242	5456904	If that wasn't Ranma S and I knew he's like a legitimate person, I would have thought that was a spoiler.
5456924	5457224	You know what?
5457344	5462547	I've gotten like five $10 off coupons from Dave & Buster's just by being in their little club thing.
5463047	5464128	So they've...
5465208	5465669	and DarkSakura.
5486452	5489514	Same card ever since then, and it has given me problems.
5489794	5496659	When I went to Times Square once, I went to an OLR lunch with some of the OLR listeners, like Zaku, Ranma, some of the people you've heard call into this show before.
5497679	5506185	Went to lunch with them and some others, and they saw my card get borked by the system because I didn't roam it, so I had to get it saved, and then it happened when I came back.
5506485	5508926	So long story short, I've used the same card for 10 years.
5509327	5514130	Now, Dave & Buster's has this program where once you spend a certain amount of chips, you go gold.
5514870	5515631	DarkSakura.com
5533240	5535582	I don't wanna go on Wednesday night This is serious business
5557749	5557909	Aw.
5559189	5559810	I'll take Dan.
5560110	5561530	Dan and I can have date night at Dave and Buster's.
5561550	5563371	But I don't have classes on Wednesday night anymore.
5563511	5563791	Okay.
5563831	5569873	So I have to get up at 8.30 in the freaking morning on Monday and Wednesday to go to astronomy, which I don't need astronomy.
5571153	5571773	Don't get me started.
5573274	5574434	You don't want to go look at the planets?
5575743	5578205	I have no need for astronomy as a designer.
5578225	5579045	What's your major?
5579065	5579786	Graphic design.
5580726	5583188	And I already have... You need to know how to draw lines.
5583308	5586670	My degree will be here in like a few weeks.
5587611	5589012	I'm officially a graduate.
5590753	5591173	I'm sorry.
5591193	5595576	You didn't get a letter in seven degrees saying, sorry, you need some astronomy.
5596129	5598250	All right, let me go to a couple tweets from Tigerclaw.
5598651	5601633	Tigerclaw is funny because he tweeted us a couple things.
5601673	5604074	I'm like, dude, you tweeted us stuff that's going to come up later in the show.
5604395	5605976	So he tweeted like seven things.
5607156	5609558	But you only get two, Tigerclaw, but I'll read these.
5609598	5610699	These are the ones that caught my eye.
5611159	5614301	Harmonix is announcing a new game at E3.
5614341	5617984	We'll file this between Dunn, of course, but, I mean, it's official.
5618324	5620425	Harmonix is going to announce something new at E3.
5620465	5622226	What does go between Dunn, of course?
5622387	5625729	Dance Central 2 apparently is going to go between those two.
5626669	5646534	I'm wondering if there is actually like something else with this as well they have said it is not Rock Band 4 that is confirmed and apparently there was an interview with Game Informer saying quote rest assured that Harmonix is still developing new ideas and concepts to advance the Rock Band franchise and we look forward to sharing them when the time is right
5647074	5649355	I don't think Harmonix is all about Dance Central necessarily.
5649435	5650956	I think there'll be something new from them.
5651716	5654257	I kind of hope it's a DJ game.
5654377	5655478	I hope it's a DJ game too.
5656278	5657318	I really do.
5657538	5659439	I think they should just do it.
5659539	5661300	If Konami refuses, then you know what?
5661340	5668843	When they fall asleep at the wheel, as they always have with their series that could do great here, then let Harmonix do it better.
5670544	5670864	For real.
5672366	5673507	One other one I'm going to read here.
5674107	5674227	L.A.
5674267	5678909	Noire, we were talking about earlier in the show, it is banned if you live in the UAE.
5679509	5680589	So, yep, there it is.
5680709	5690893	United Arab Emirates, the game magazine there, I'm sorry, the retail chain, Geekay Games, I keep reading it as Geeky Games, updated their Facebook saying, L.A.
5690913	5691894	Noire has been banned.
5692814	5695836	Yep, the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, their National Media Council.
5695856	5698718	They didn't say why they've banned the game, but they've banned it.
5698998	5701960	It probably has something to do with dead woman beaver.
5702600	5704361	I'm just taking a speculation.
5706243	5706823	Just guessing.
5707744	5709705	Dead animals are nothing to, you know.
5710085	5712026	Dead animals are nothing to ban a video game about.
5712046	5713287	Is it Winona's brown beaver?
5717270	5718510	I don't think her name's Winona.
5719131	5719391	Anyhow.
5720529	5720969	Maybe it is.
5721009	5721269	I don't know.
5721289	5722250	I haven't played Eleanor yet.
5722330	5723591	Alright, that does it for Twitter topics.
5723831	5726572	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send your shit early for next week.
5727153	5727773	Let's move on.
5727893	5730034	I just outed myself as a Primus fan.
5732816	5733396	Moving on.
5733876	5735217	Loki, let's get into some other news.
5735497	5736477	Yes.
5736818	5740700	So, this is kind of... I don't know...
5742830	5743992	Zynga Frontierville Oregon Trail
5759491	5760812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5777276	5801180	And of course the learning company, the people that hold the rights to the Oregon Trail They're none too happy about the fact that Zynga is basically ripping off their game And even calling it the Oregon Trail expansion I mean, granted, yes, the Oregon Trail is a real thing But it's also very, very, very, very similar to the Oregon Trail game
5802632	5806873	Usually I would go off on a tangent right now about frivolous lawsuits, etc, etc.
5806933	5809694	But, you know, it's Zynga and I'm just kind of like, eh, let them.
5809814	5820456	I watched the trailer and that damn thing is, you know, if not a really lame version of the Oregon Trail that you would see on Facebook, it is basically everything that's part of the Oregon Trail.
5820676	5829418	Yeah, I realize the Oregon Trail is like a historic thing, but the other tricky thing about it is that Oregon Trail is actually on Facebook as a game right now.
5831619	5831779	So...
5833301	5837983	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, unpopular opinion, the actual trail was called the Oregon Trail.
5838043	5841084	I doubt they have the rights to everything related to that historical event.
5841885	5843705	No, it's not an unpopular opinion.
5843745	5844366	It's true.
5844806	5845586	It's just, I don't know.
5846727	5852929	There's so many other game companies that need to be advocated for that I don't feel the need to save Zynga right now.
5853269	5853970	You know what I mean?
5854730	5855310	Like, sorry.
5855330	5855650	Zynga.
5857714	5862378	I want to look at this trail, er... Hopefully I don't get sued because I said trail.
5862638	5864540	I want to look at this trailer real fast here.
5878035	5880715	and a carpenter for fixing the wagon and such like.
5881436	5885016	And a doctor in case folks come down with the Rocky Mountain Scoots.
5885436	5891257	You can leave messages and fancy presents for your friends so they'll want to visit your expedition every day.
5891537	5895858	Okay, I gotta be honest, this really does look like the Facebook game, the Oregon Trail Facebook game.
5895898	5900199	Like, especially with the hunting thing and the whole fact how you invite your friends to go on the trail with you.
5900639	5904820	Like, I think they have a point, actually.
5905400	5907320	I really can't help zing on this one.
5907680	5908960	Actually, sorry.
5909820	5910661	I'm sorry.
5910821	5915521	Seeing video of any Zynga game being played makes me hate Facebook.
5916121	5919882	Like, I have hatred of Facebook, you know, thanks to Zynga.
5919942	5921262	It's like, invite your friends!
5921962	5924123	I fucking hate when people invite me to shit.
5924163	5926143	You know what I do with people that invite me to shit?
5926663	5927343	I ignore it.
5928824	5933084	And perhaps block you from sending me invites for shit.
5934865	5936345	I will not play Facebook games.
5937538	5947267	I deleted all mine You guys would be impressed I didn't even play GagaVille I didn't play it I'm sorry, okay?
5947287	5950290	She's sold out, okay?
5955549	5956250	She's sold out.
5956290	5956870	I mean, come on.
5957091	5959854	You're teaming up with Zynga for shit.
5960434	5969063	I don't give a shit if they donated money to the Tsunami stuff, but they donated it through you or you donated it through them.
5969684	5970224	Big deal.
5970264	5970745	You know what?
5971385	5973127	I just think it's retarded that you're...
5974829	5980132	I know, but I'm not going to play it.
5980272	5981332	I am not going to play it.
5982333	5983674	And Loki, you hit the nail on the head.
5983754	5986035	It was smart because it's going after the target audience.
5986075	5990558	And I don't mean to sound like a sexist, but it's a bunch of women playing Farmville.
5990958	5996201	And that's who a lot of Gaga's music appeals to.
5996501	5999603	Most, not all, most of the Gaga haters are straight men.
5999823	6000724	Like, it's just...
6001524	6004806	I did, however, find an incredibly hilarious screen capture.
6005086	6008128	Madonna, back in the day, did some really weird shit, okay?
6008708	6009649	She was really weird.
6009709	6015112	She sold her soul to Pepsi, and then they just fucked her over after that whole like a prayer thing.
6015717	6018739	But Gaga is like, you know, Madonna to Eleven.
6018819	6022381	It's just... Seriously, she's fucking... No, she is.
6022421	6025342	She's actually more like Marilyn Manson than she is Madonna.
6025362	6026783	She's just fucking crazy.
6027163	6028764	And you know what happened to Marilyn Manson?
6028985	6030245	People stopped caring!
6030585	6032346	And that's what's gonna happen to Lady Gaga.
6032386	6033847	People are gonna stop fucking caring.
6033867	6034468	Because you know what?
6034968	6036369	I gotta admit, her... I'll never stop.
6036449	6036829	I love her.
6037109	6038830	Her early music was okay.
6039370	6043493	But each song that comes out after that, I care less and less about.
6044193	6045898	Like, she starts making up stuff.
6046098	6046700	It's like...
6048689	6053131	Yeah, anybody can use spout out non-words, you know, in a song.
6053171	6057713	I mean, that's easy to do, but it's just, I don't get it.
6058214	6071640	Like, for example, Born This Way totally sounds like an anthem, you know, a gay anthem or something like that, that she, you know, crafted on purpose so that it gets played in gay clubs to make sure that she has, you know, the gay demographic.
6071680	6072780	You know, that's all it is.
6074081	6077883	Seriously, it's just figuring out how to, you know,
6080903	6109164	I did find actually one interesting marketing thing that she did where they were giving away a can of monster fuel now I have to ask this since you talk about how Gaga's music gets weirder and weirder and I really hope I don't get screwed by clicking on random YouTube links but have you heard that Lady Gaga has a new song on her album called Scheisse which is German for shit so she literally has a song called shit on her new album let me play a little bit for you
6112497	6118342	Now that isn't weird at all!
6121845	6125128	Except, like... Wait, wait, wait, keep playing that for a second there.
6126109	6129932	I'm sorry, it just sounded like a different song for a second.
6129972	6131814	Why did they... It sounded like another...
6136886	6138547	Loki made me play Gaga, you guys.
6138787	6139228	He made me.
6139728	6140769	You know what?
6140849	6147993	Whoever did this thing should have used the Ashet instead of the B. Yeah, no.
6149454	6150015	I'm serious.
6150075	6155758	If that picture right there doesn't make her look like a Satan blow-up doll, I don't know what to say.
6155838	6162403	I mean, she was on American Idol the other week as a mentor, which is just like, okay, whatever.
6162563	6162903	You mad?
6163423	6164084	No, I'm not mad.
6164124	6166025	I just rolled my eyes.
6166605	6169626	She's like, okay, oh, it's my time on camera?
6169646	6170807	I'm going to say something crazy.
6171888	6172388	Crazy.
6173328	6177911	And it's like, okay, that wasn't really helpful at all, but thanks.
6180472	6182974	I don't know what the hell she was wearing, but it was something retarded.
6183014	6183354	It's like...
6184378	6188181	I'm not going to stand for such gaga-hating on this program.
6188221	6189181	She's a genius.
6190222	6191002	She's a saint.
6191043	6192383	Please.
6192524	6193244	A genius?
6193304	6194965	She's a genius.
6195425	6199568	Look, we're talking about her on a fucking video game podcast.
6199968	6203311	You bought all this crap hook, line, and sink.
6203351	6205912	No, as an almost genius, I take offense to that.
6207073	6207714	I'm sorry.
6209135	6210556	I fucking knew this was going to happen.
6210576	6211856	This is a fucking mistake.
6211996	6213918	Revoke his Mensa membership immediately.
6214818	6216879	No, seriously, she's not a fucking genius.
6217299	6218899	She's good at marketing, okay?
6218959	6219519	You know what?
6220139	6222900	There are people that are in the magazine business that are good at marketing.
6223480	6231922	Steve Jobs is good at marketing, but he's not fucking... Well, okay, he is fucking crazy, but he's not fucking... overtly fucking crazy, you know?
6233923	6234543	Whatever, you know what?
6234563	6235163	She's a fad.
6235183	6235723	She'll go away.
6236544	6237324	It's what's gonna happen.
6237344	6238824	Madonna never went away, neither will she.
6239004	6240745	Oh, yeah, Madonna never went away.
6240805	6242285	She showed everyone what the character looks like.
6243362	6244563	She went away, same with Cher.
6244583	6245564	Cher, they're both gone.
6245584	6247006	Cher turned 65 this week.
6247046	6248287	Cher's eligible for Medicare.
6249068	6249588	Feeling old?
6252831	6253312	She'll go away.
6253612	6254172	I don't even care.
6255133	6259217	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, fact, there will be a Gaga video game sometime in her lifetime.
6259277	6260078	God, I hope so.
6260659	6261199	God, I hope so.
6261219	6262000	There already is.
6262541	6263081	I mean, come on.
6263121	6264182	It is Gaga-ville, I guess.
6265563	6265864	Anyway.
6267125	6268046	And we've all seen her cooch.
6268587	6268887	All right.
6270189	6271971	It looks like... Is she wearing it on her face?
6272071	6278558	Because I swear to God, you know, sometimes I wonder that she's just relocated her vagina to her face.
6278698	6279599	I mean, it would not surprise me.
6279619	6283203	How did we get from the fucking Oregon Trail to Lady Gaga's vagina on her face?
6283384	6284004	That's what I want to know.
6284024	6284345	Zynga.
6284465	6284945	There you go.
6285686	6289290	I bet you anything that's going to be the next album cover is her with a...
6291294	6299201	VJ Face It will be her coming out of her own vagina That'll be the Elmar right there She'll be coming out of her own vagina She's like, I'll be born!
6299381	6317757	Actually, you need to see last night's I swear this will be the end of it, guys You need to see last night's Saturday Night Live performance Because she was on Saturday Night Live And she did Born This Way, her song And what she did during the performance She actually got pregnant And gave birth live on stage To a bunch of glitter During the performance
6318377	6321058	It was an art piece and it was brilliant.
6321559	6322559	It was brilliant.
6322639	6323320	I was moved.
6324660	6327242	By the way, this is the last of the Gaga for me.
6328422	6330383	You know what she did to everybody who was camping out in line?
6330904	6337547	She bought them dinner and donuts and coffee and signed autographs and took pictures with people waiting in line.
6338267	6339588	Because she's a nice person.
6339608	6341189	She genuinely likes her fans.
6342249	6343590	She genuinely likes her fans.
6343950	6344631	But you know what?
6344731	6345271	I'm sorry.
6345291	6347052	That still doesn't make you a fucking whore.
6347972	6355475	And if you call what she did on stage art, then I'm sorry, a peep show is fucking art then.
6355995	6356495	And you know what?
6356535	6361337	There's more peep shows out there than there are gaga, so I guess we have that to be thankful.
6361457	6362737	I don't hate on peep shows.
6363078	6366159	That's one thing you'll never hear me ranting about on this program, Loki.
6366219	6369380	I would never touch your sacred pornography collection.
6369480	6370360	I would never.
6371200	6372621	There is nothing sacred about that.
6376929	6377249	Alright.
6377529	6377850	Whatever.
6377970	6378970	I'm done.
6379291	6380331	Can we get back to video games?
6380391	6380652	Let's.
6380772	6381052	Alright.
6381292	6382233	This is very important.
6382273	6382493	Look.
6382793	6387636	We need to go from Lady Gaga talking about very important video game news such as this.
6390258	6397203	Cat Food Maker Friskies has released iPad and Android games for your cat.
6399602	6401443	This is why Gaga's podcast has to end.
6401643	6402063	It's cute.
6402083	6406664	Because we have to talk about tasty treasures, party mix-up, and catfishing.
6407105	6408925	iPad games for your cat.
6409265	6411166	In iPad, pussy play with you.
6412846	6416068	Okay, you know, I watched the little video and it is super adorable.
6416968	6420909	I would get this for Shermie if I had an iPad and she didn't have paws.
6422850	6424470	Oh my god, this looks so cute.
6425371	6428992	Your little pet can touch the food and it splits up.
6429804	6430785	Catfishing Catfishing
6452887	6458314	Now Salacious Pop, my significant other in chatroom says, I am not buying Maruko, our cat, an iPad.
6458394	6458914	Fuck that.
6459215	6460156	And to that I'm saying, no, no, no.
6460316	6461437	You're not buying Maruko an iPad.
6461457	6467925	You're buying me an iPad and maybe I'll let your cat play with it.
6468045	6469267	My birthday is June 26th.
6469287	6469707	Just saying.
6469767	6470348	It's so cute.
6470408	6471389	I'm getting you a Takei mug.
6473228	6486654	No, but in all seriousness, there's a lot to laugh at here when you're talking about kitties playing games on the iPad, but at the same time, it's oddly fucking fascinating that we are now to the point where we're making video games for the cats.
6488208	6489789	They're free, right?
6490550	6492751	I would hope so because they're kind of commercial games.
6493352	6493712	Let's see.
6495313	6499416	The games do keep score and your cats can compete to see who has the best reaction time.
6499436	6500357	Your cat don't give a shit.
6501257	6502879	My cat gives a shit all over the floor.
6503299	6505140	Actually, I'm not sure if they're free or not.
6507102	6507582	I can't see.
6509227	6510708	They can't be more than a dollar.
6510768	6511849	I'm sure they're not more than a dollar.
6511889	6512849	They're probably free.
6513470	6516111	Because given the simplicity of the games, they're probably free.
6516431	6518413	See, look, Shermie is not sleeping anymore.
6518453	6519613	She's looking up and listening.
6520294	6520634	That's right.
6520654	6523075	Shermie's like, fuck yeah, mommy, I want that.
6523796	6525917	Well, mommy wants an iPad, baby, so you have to wait.
6526778	6527878	Tell daddy that mommy wants an iPad.
6527898	6529519	She only wants an iPad so she can shit on it.
6529559	6530720	That's what your cat will do.
6531140	6531340	No.
6531501	6532781	Your cat will be like, what's this game?
6533582	6535283	Shermie, do you just want to shit on everything?
6538021	6540804	TigerClaw How long till they make games for dogs or ferrets?
6557196	6558717	Byron D. Zero said something even funnier.
6558857	6559157	What's that?
6559357	6560737	Rorschach and Deadpool.
6561077	6564698	Because they played the same music that they played in part of that.
6566718	6579321	Salacious Pop in our chat room says, This is a game for people who make their cats real Facebook pages and then comment with meow meow on their IRL profile with coworkers and shit on them.
6580161	6586562	Those are the people that creep me the crap out on Facebook when they do that for their pets and their babies.
6588483	6589703	Your baby can't speak.
6590943	6593804	And if your baby can speak, it's not anything intelligible by most people.
6594924	6595964	Your baby doesn't need a Facebook.
6596084	6597044	Your cat doesn't need a Facebook.
6597064	6598004	Your dog doesn't need a Facebook.
6598284	6602725	Your children, probably, even if they're up to seven years old, don't need a Facebook.
6602845	6606146	Maybe the baby hit random buttons and autocorrected everything.
6606986	6607286	Right, anyhow.
6635444	6635765	DarkSakura
6643674	6647096	Well, I'm actually still on the German alphabet website.
6647336	6647716	Portal!
6648717	6649837	Portal 2, Offended People.
6650677	6652878	And you know who the people had offended?
6653639	6654399	The Adopted.
6655860	6660282	Because of all the cracks that GLaDOS makes in the game about the character being adopted.
6661362	6664664	And, of course, I like it in the end when Wheatley's doing, goes, Fatty!
6664804	6665604	Adopted Fatty!
6666124	6669586	It's like, you are adopted and that's terrible.
6671207	6671747	But, um...
6672627	6691098	Yeah, basically this dude named Neil Staple was playing Portal 2, and he's the adopted father to Zoe, a Chinese orphan, and got pissed off when GLaDOS was going off on Chell for being adopted.
6692406	6700768	Of course, also overweight people and idiots are offended too, because they also talk about all that.
6701608	6705949	And probably trash is insulted, and probably turrets.
6708309	6717511	So yeah, it's the adopter who is insulted, not the adoptee.
6719176	6719516	Again.
6719957	6722499	Oh wait, do we have local news story on this that we can play?
6723240	6724361	Oh my god, I love these.
6724601	6728044	I love when local news media like completely misrepresents video games.
6728084	6728945	This is going to be amazing.
6729265	6730126	Okay, I'm going to play this.
6730186	6730386	Ready?
6732528	6736111	And if we're lucky, maybe somehow Loki can turn this into Lady Gaga chat.
6737352	6742596	And tonight, a father is shocked at the insensitivity he says he witnessed.
6742857	6743377	Here's the clip.
6744378	6745499	What's wrong with being adopted?
6745519	6745719	Well,
6747248	6754115	Actually, the quality of this is rather shit, and it's really quiet, so I don't know if I should really play the whole thing, because it's not really coming through.
6755957	6757278	So maybe I won't do that.
6757338	6759220	Well, let me see if I can crank it up some other way.
6759280	6760181	Hold on one sec, guys.
6760922	6762804	Live radio is tons of fun.
6763825	6765566	No, I have wave up as high as it'll go.
6765987	6766968	I can't get that any louder.
6767548	6768409	What a shit little...
6769230	6770531	We'll play some of it.
6770991	6771652	No, it's too quiet.
6771672	6772252	They can't hear it.
6774214	6775014	Let me go to YouTube.
6775474	6776455	See if I can find it real quick.
6777676	6778697	WBTV Portal 2.
6778917	6779197	Hold on.
6779277	6780938	Find Portal 2 being adopted.
6783880	6785041	Okay, I'm going to see if this works better.
6787102	6790164	We have discovered a popular video game making fun of adoption.
6790405	6795668	And tonight, a father is shocked at the insensitivity he says he witnessed.
6795908	6796389	Here's the clip.
6797446	6798988	What's wrong with being adopted?
6799188	6802573	Um, well, um, lack of parents.
6805953	6809476	The game is called Portal 2, and it's only been available for about a month.
6809836	6814260	Regina Mack just talked to the father who shared this, who saw this with his daughter.
6814380	6817523	Yeah, I bet he was shocked and really surprised by something like this.
6817543	6821907	Yeah, no idea, particularly because this is a game that builds itself as educational.
6822207	6823908	It's rated E for everyone.
6823989	6829533	As we said, Neil Staple was playing the game with his 10-year-old adopted daughter when they saw the clip tonight.
6829854	6833417	He says he and his wife are still searching for a way to try to explain it.
6835209	6835790	I didn't know what to do.
6835850	6836831	I still don't know what to do.
6837211	6848962	Neil Staples still can't believe what he heard while playing the video game Portal 2 with his 10-year-old adopted daughter Zoe.
6849422	6852345	They really do make this look pretty terrible, I gotta admit.
6852385	6855087	But, like, I feel like this is, like, really taken out of context.
6855688	6856128	It is.
6856468	6856949	It's, like...
6857489	6861331	You have to remember, they're taunting everything about her.
6861792	6863052	You know, no matter what it is.
6863132	6866154	And to be honest, I don't think they ever really proved that she's adopted.
6866734	6866914	No.
6867315	6868095	So, I don't know.
6868295	6870697	Like, I just kind of feel like this is really selective hearing.
6871936	6873457	That's my biggest issue of what's going on here.
6873477	6878019	But I watch this news report and I go, wow, this game's fucking rude.
6878539	6881160	But I've played through the game and I didn't get that impression at all.
6881560	6882441	It's E10+.
6882461	6886242	It's not a baseline E for everyone.
6886923	6893705	So, in other words, the 10-year-old daughter, since she's not 10+, she's 10, probably shouldn't have been watching.
6893785	6894486	Well, it's 10 and over.
6895612	6896233	It's not over 10.
6896273	6897275	God damn you, Loki.
6897295	6898617	You always gotta fucking disagree with me.
6898657	6899458	Did you hear that?
6899819	6904627	The character in the popular kids video game is actually taunted for being adopted.
6904967	6906189	It literally pokes fun...
6907791	6913757	Wow, and you literally proved that you're an idiot.
6914117	6914738	She's Chinese.
6914798	6916880	She obviously doesn't look like us.
6917060	6925329	It throws the question, the most ultimate question that that child is ever going to have for you.
6928211	6929553	And it just throws her right in the living room.
6930206	6931546	Is he going to cry?
6931947	6933327	I really needed attention.
6934347	6938588	That's why I contacted the news, because I needed attention, because I'm an idiot.
6938988	6939328	Hold on.
6939569	6940289	But he'd heard.
6940309	6950111	Neil immediately cut the game off, hoping Zoe hadn't heard the cruel joke from a video game billed as educational and appropriate for everyone 10 and up.
6950411	6952232	And it says rated E for everybody.
6953371	6956537	and I was thinking maybe it's rated E for everybody except for orphans.
6956918	6960124	If you're not an adoptive parent, it's probably not that big a deal to you.
6961026	6965254	If you are an adoptive parent, it was literally the worst thing I could possibly have heard.
6965962	6967403	But did Zoe hear it?
6968024	6973628	She's sticking to her guns that she didn't hear it and to me that message means she's not ready to talk about it and I'm not going to force it.
6973889	6974849	Oh my god.
6974869	6977692	Eyes rolling too much.
6978352	6985418	Neil says they steer clear of that part of the game and hope their daughter never feels like she's any less because she's adopted.
6985959	6987340	I can't imagine my life without her.
6987640	6991563	I mean, she's just such an awesome child.
6992104	6994305	She's just made our lives so much better.
6995486	6997608	Now again, we did say this game was edgy.
6997688	6999670	Surely there'll be a counterpoint to this, right?
6999710	7003373	Like, surely they tried to reach out to Valve for comment, right?
7003413	7006896	It's because you have to sort of figure out a way to get out of every single room.
7007156	7009598	We did contact Sony, who distributes the game.
7009939	7013882	They told us to contact Valve, the company that actually created the game.
7014242	7014583	I did.
7015083	7016164	We have not heard back from them.
7016184	7018606	They're passing the buck onto somebody else.
7018886	7019307	Oh, oh!
7019967	7020547	Bitch!
7020707	7021868	That is so not the way it works.
7021888	7024168	First off, Sony doesn't distribute the game.
7024248	7026389	It's EA that distributes the game, idiot.
7027489	7031391	God, you're fucking... Send me the link to that place because I'm going to type one hell of a rebuttal.
7031891	7033551	Well, you know what?
7033811	7039393	Since they didn't respond back to our claim, they're wrong.
7039493	7049216	Having interned in local news as long as I did, I mean, I know this means a lot, but by trying to contact them, they probably gave a couple hours tops.
7049716	7051638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7075060	7079088	I watched that piece and I agree, Portal looks pretty fucked up.
7079629	7083517	The website is WBTV.com Email them all.
7083777	7084399	Email them, please.
7084679	7085000	Email them.
7086443	7105886	I think honestly the part that they kind of leave out that kind of irritates me is that if you're going to play that game with your kid you kind of have to be able to explain it all to them and you have to explain that these characters will mock anything to try that's what GLaDOS does she mocks everything what's next is somebody going to be upset because the game called them fat
7107406	7109167	I don't know, it's just a little silly
7125151	7126571	Well, I actually am going to email them.
7126631	7128132	Well, that was my story, so... Loki.
7153551	7153931	Ah, yes.
7155752	7157513	So, I'm not complaining about that kind of stuff.
7158613	7164515	Ubisoft, you know, they're looking at maybe taking the next step with some of their franchises.
7164595	7173079	Instead of leaving it in the hands of people that may not be able to do their franchises well in the motion picture world, they're going to go ahead and form...
7173699	7183150	Ubisoft Motion Pictures They're going to adapt some of their biggest properties Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Ghost Recon into 3D features
7186148	7204723	I'm very disappointed though that Rabbids were not part of that Because honestly I think that would work much better as a 3D animated feature than some of this stuff But whatever They said in addition to the trio of feature projects, the studio is reportedly developing 3D CGI animated series Oh, they are!
7204803	7206605	Based on the Rabbids properties, awesome!
7208326	7211828	So they comprise of 78 episodes, 7 minutes a piece.
7212888	7215509	It's almost like they're little trailers that they have.
7216730	7217531	That's awesome.
7218171	7221893	But seriously though, they should get their own full length theater or theatrical movie.
7223854	7225835	Couldn't be any worse than some of the other stuff I've seen.
7226280	7226480	Yeah.
7228762	7229103	All right.
7229863	7230264	Let's see.
7230404	7233727	Actually, two other quick E3-related stories.
7233787	7234708	Hello, Konami.
7234768	7237510	And I think this was brought up earlier in the show, but let's just throw it out there.
7237570	7241094	They are going to be doing their E3 press conference a little bit early this year.
7241934	7246539	They're going to be doing their press conference, I believe it is the Sunday beforehand.
7247720	7248200	Let's see.
7248340	7249381	It is on...
7251981	7261468	Pre-E3 show 2011, and it is happening... Is there really a press release that doesn't have the fucking time of the event in here?
7263049	7267932	Konami today announced the venue picks for the company's first annual global pre-E3 show 2011.
7268092	7268132	Um...
7273504	7274724	at the times listed below.
7291169	7294610	Alright, so they're going to be doing their press conference on the Thursday beforehand.
7295070	7297451	Give bloggers and people a chance to talk about it.
7297551	7299471	And you can attend live if you want.
7299811	7307174	They're going to actually be renting places in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, Sao Paulo, Mexico City.
7307274	7308634	So they're getting international with this.
7308894	7312797	See now, my only thing about this though is they said it's like live viewing parties.
7312997	7316700	Now are they just watching the press conference or are they actually going to be able to play games there and stuff?
7316840	7317421	I don't know.
7318061	7319002	They aren't really saying.
7319102	7321684	It makes it sound like they're just going to be able to watch.
7322345	7325728	Like you'll just get to be able to watch this.
7326168	7329150	And you can register online for a chance to attend.
7331251	7334113	The place here in San Francisco they're going to be doing at is Temple Nightclub.
7334533	7337254	I'm not familiar with that place, but I imagine it's at 4 o'clock.
7337334	7338054	It's kind of early.
7338494	7343036	But they probably have to pick a time like that because 4 o'clock would be 7 o'clock on the East Coast.
7343516	7344817	And what time would that be in Japan?
7344857	7346998	It would be 8 a.m.
7347018	7347818	the next day, I think.
7348183	7351647	So maybe that's why they're doing it at that time.
7351687	7352048	I don't know.
7352528	7356933	But yeah, they're doing a pre-E3 show 2011 and talking about these venues they picked.
7357013	7361879	So facebook.com slash Konami if you want to go to the viewing event or you can just watch it online.
7363812	7366074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7384591	7390892	Yeah, it is a little weird, because G4, don't they have the exclusive E3 pass or whatever?
7390912	7395793	Usually they do for, I know they've done Microsoft's conference in the past.
7395873	7401454	Technically, though, the press conferences aren't a part of E3, so that's why Spike probably paid money for it.
7402794	7403534	So, interesting.
7404255	7407495	So, everybody's going to be able to watch that live, as long as you have basic cable.
7407555	7412056	Otherwise, I'm sure it'll be streamed over Justin TV everywhere, so check that out.
7413655	7416316	Alright, with that, let's go to the mailbag.
7416416	7417877	Every week you guys send us emails.
7418297	7421739	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
7422879	7428002	And DarkSakura is going to dive in the mailbag headfirst and find some emails to read for us today.
7429318	7430099	First email.
7430319	7431180	Greetings, OLR.
7431240	7432381	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7432821	7434963	I have no game-related comments or questions this week.
7435003	7440928	I just wanted to send hearts your way and say that OLR is the best and only gaming podcast that I currently listen to.
7441509	7445973	And whoever is responsible for putting the podcast up on the internet says doing an awesome job.
7446133	7446473	Alright.
7446553	7450416	I literally don't allow myself to do anything else Sunday nights until the show is posted.
7464588	7472853	Plus, the other thing that made it a lot easier, I changed the way I write descriptions, so I don't actually have to think of a sassy commentary on what happened during the show.
7472973	7476134	I just basically post the first five stories from the show roll, and then that's it.
7476995	7478116	Who's reading the descriptions?
7478396	7479997	Our subscribers?
7480577	7481918	I don't think they really read the description.
7481938	7485920	I could be wrong, but in the interest of getting it up faster, I just...
7487321	7512570	and we don't edit the show either I mean I have to edit it to take out the middle part where we play copyright music and just clean up the beginning and end but as for like the actual content in the middle it's live radio we don't really edit like something has to go really really wrong or somebody has to say something really really bad for us to edit and I don't remember I haven't edited any content out in easily a year at least so
7513846	7518529	Well, I guess this doesn't really apply to you anymore, Rob, since I know you've got the trial.
7519030	7523713	But Holly D sent an invite and said any of us can use it to play Rift.
7525955	7529337	Oh, she's been pimping out on Horde House on the forums over there.
7529417	7533620	She's desperate to get her Corgi and the other little rewards that she can get, so...
7534724	7536005	Well, it's there.
7536405	7539007	Maybe I'll look at it, but I really can't.
7539327	7539887	I have no time.
7539927	7541328	How are you liking Rift?
7542709	7544590	I'm going to plead the fifth until later.
7544930	7545270	All right.
7547311	7551634	You can say without a doubt, though, that it is better than Final Fantasy XIV.
7552454	7552995	Absolutely.
7553155	7553395	Okay.
7555556	7558178	I was still writing my angry email to WBTV.
7558238	7558438	Sorry.
7559011	7560852	Anyway, we have another one from Holly.
7588181	7592664	That's, but you gotta admit, there's a ton of people doing it out of being purely fickle.
7593724	7595545	There's a lot of people, there's just, that's how people are.
7596205	7597106	I can understand it.
7597166	7607552	For every, you know, one person who's got true, authentic integrity and turning it in, there's gonna be 25 other that are gonna just be, I'm telling you.
7608572	7608992	Seriously.
7609853	7611014	I mean, okay, to continue.
7611034	7611534	I mean, it's...
7611954	7613014	Can I say this real quick though?
7615275	7618536	Here's where the line is between fickle and yeah, I meant it.
7619496	7625437	When a game like The Last Guardian comes out, are you going to rebuy a PS3 if you sold yours back?
7626077	7629698	If you mean it and you stick to your guns, then you know what?
7629718	7630458	You have every right.
7630558	7631098	It's your money.
7631138	7632839	You should spend it on what you want.
7633659	7634100	To continue?
7634120	7634180	Yes.
7650652	7651573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7669725	7672867	I stopped playing WoW because of something Blizzard did that I find unacceptable.
7673267	7674648	It doesn't matter that I like the game.
7674688	7680552	I'm not going to put money into a company that treats its customers badly and I really feel this is why people are abandoning ship on Sony.
7680672	7691999	Holly D. Like I said, I think that for every one person that's got a legitimate reason with actual integrity behind it, the rest of them are sheeping.
7693099	7710079	you know and I would fully admit there's been times I really would want to leave Blizzard but I kind of feel like I'd be being one of those fickle people like I just go right back six months later when that patch comes out that I really want to play so I don't know it's tough when you stick to your guns that's pretty admirable
7710739	7711040	Outro Music
7733087	7736069	Um, and no, I'm not, don't hear me wrong.
7736129	7742634	I'm not knocking vegans, but there are some people who like do it for a couple weeks and they're like, this is too hard.
7742694	7744375	I got to go back to eating chicken, you know?
7745015	7747817	So I don't know.
7749278	7751279	I think I personally, I've tried to go vegetarian.
7751319	7751820	I can't do it.
7752280	7753461	I can't even go vegetarian.
7753721	7754181	It's too hard.
7754281	7755122	I didn't get enough protein.
7756849	7780090	I know how to get protein, I just still wasn't getting enough of it Anyway, I don't know when I just started comparing Blizzard to being a vegetarian, but okay Next email Hello guys, first of all, congratulations on your awesome show I listen to it at work and it makes my hours go by faster I would like your opinion on these two topics One, games with poor or no control configuration options Yeah, that sucks
7781903	7784105	and games that don't allow you to pause the cutscenes.
7784586	7785967	Thank you and good luck with your show.
7786327	7791853	And that's from... I'll just say... Cadius.
7794089	7815076	I wish the emailer had given us some specific examples of games like I know there are games like that that don't have the custom and I know I've gone on this tangent on the show before like games that have the really whack controls that you just can't recustomize and yet now I'm drawing a total blank like I can't remember any of them I'm sure a chat room will help us out here this is why I love having a live chat
7816817	7819459	And then cutscenes, yeah, that's kind of annoying.
7819579	7821240	Or unskippable ones, too.
7821760	7824902	Like Mortal Kombat, story mode, it's pretty cool.
7825222	7827804	And you can pause cutscenes, but you can't skip them.
7830704	7859280	unless it's your second time playing through which I think is really weird because what I don't like is that in Mortal Kombat if you are stuck on a certain part you have to keep watching the cutscene leading up to it over and over until you beat it if you turn off the game because if you just hit retry you don't have to watch the whole thing over and over but like sometimes I get so frustrated I need to walk away for a little bit and then come back and the last thing I want to do when I come back is watch the cutscene again so yeah
7859560	7862282	By the way, Xenocore says no vegan diet, no vegan powers.
7862302	7864324	I loved that whole scene.
7864364	7865645	Oh, that's from Scott Pilgrim, huh?
7865685	7865885	Yeah.
7866245	7866966	I see what you did there.
7868707	7868987	Okay.
7871048	7872049	Moving forward.
7873050	7873891	Hi, OLA crew.
7873951	7874331	This is...
7876102	7880885	and Ramadija, I guess that's how I hope I pronounce it right, a blind gamer from Indonesia.
7881606	7886989	I sent you some emails a long time ago and this email will absolutely be the sign that I'm still following you until now.
7887069	7887910	Great show as always.
7888610	7896616	Although I cannot contribute my thoughts like the other listeners because I cannot play games like others do, I hope I can still be part of OLR's discussion with my personal thought about video games.
7897396	7903160	I consider myself as one of the veteran gamers because when I was a child, video games were so easy to be played even without my sight.
7903340	7904401	Sorry, can I interrupt for real quick?
7904421	7905502	What was the name of the emailer again?
7907542	7908202	Ramadija?
7908303	7911623	Is that the same person that sent the Scars of Time flute thing?
7911663	7912183	I think it is.
7912423	7912663	Okay.
7913104	7919905	So, okay, like, don't invalidate your opinion just because you have, like, a challenge.
7920065	7927787	Because, you know, in watching what you did with the Scars of Time thing, clearly you have a love and passion for video games.
7927847	7932348	So that makes you just as much of a gamer as anybody else with just as much a right to your opinion as anyone else.
7932408	7933748	Just throwing that out there.
7933868	7934068	Okay.
7934568	7934868	DarkSakura.com
7951036	7978808	so I would like to share the enjoyment I've gotten several months ago it was when I found the Angry Video Game Nerd I love Angry Video Game Nerd and imported the DVDs from the author I don't know if any one of you ever heard about AVGN it's a series of classic video games featuring James as a nerd that plays old video games actually he reviewed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the DVD sets recently and it was hilarious but my favorite that he does is the Friday the 13th review so funny anyway
7980737	7984523	He reviews the negative sides of games with badass style.
7984903	7988088	You'll see and hear a lot of fucks and shits in there, beer included.
7988789	7991553	Just Google it or go to Wikipedia for more information.
7993696	7994397	He linked a video.
7997834	8007077	I want to share it because this show is very enjoyable for me even without my ability to see what's happening on screen I don't know what will happen to me if I am not blind and able to watch those
8017900	8041202	I believe you all can find some amusement there too now on to me like I said that I am blind so I cannot play video games the same like others but I do enjoy online games text based and right now I'm playing Blade of Eternity and the link is bladeofeternity.com and reach level 148 besides I do enjoy video game music and I love playing some of them using my flute just go to my YouTube channel it is the same guy yeah
8042663	8044744	I'm going to spell it out.
8044864	8048525	R-A-M-A-D-I-T-Y-A Skywalker and watch.
8048685	8051286	My favorite is when I played Scars of Time from Chrono Cross.
8051986	8052946	Well, that's all from me.
8053046	8056247	I hope this email can be read and I will get more friends to talk about video games.
8056387	8060389	I only have a few local friends that understand English and stuff I like anyway.
8060829	8064310	Cheers from, and I hope I'm pronouncing it right, Ramaditya.
8064330	8066450	I think that's Ramaditya.
8066470	8067471	That's how I said it too, yeah.
8068671	8069272	Very cool.
8070612	8071813	That's very sweet.
8072673	8074114	I love the Angry Video Game Nerds corruption.
8074594	8074855	Hater.
8076215	8079217	There's a whole nother layer, but I'm not going to get into it.
8079717	8080518	That's all I'm going to say.
8081478	8081738	Okay.
8083339	8086100	And it actually has nothing to do with that show specifically.
8086140	8087621	And I know that makes no sense at all.
8088482	8088902	It's the dude.
8089392	8090653	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8091033	8092735	Just, I'll tell you another day.
8092895	8093115	Okay.
8094156	8094917	Hi, all.
8095077	8096238	Oh, it's another one from Holly.
8097879	8099561	No offense, Holly, you email us a lot.
8100502	8100922	Hi, all.
8100962	8103204	Don't panic too much, but SE just got hacked too.
8103224	8110410	I was ready to flip out having played Final Fantasy XI, but it turns out that they only got email addresses unless you're a Canadian.
8110931	8114013	They got resumes for 350 Canadian potential employees too.
8118102	8118683	Thank you, Holly.
8119283	8120144	And then the last one.
8120664	8122466	By the way, I did hear about that.
8123187	8124808	Man, somebody needs to catch these hackers.
8125068	8128852	At some point, these hackers are going to get too bold.
8129172	8132895	And let me warn you, because this might not be the same person that's doing the Sony stuff.
8132915	8134136	How much bolder can you get?
8134356	8135197	Well, I know, right?
8135598	8141503	But the problem is, one of these days, hacker, you're going to get sloppy.
8143366	8151391	And it doesn't matter which video game website you get caught hacking, you're going to get blamed for the Sony thing by the mass media.
8151991	8162678	And if you don't believe me, go watch, go re-watch that zany local news report about Portal 2 to watch the way that the media will construe things to get a story.
8163279	8165100	They can say whatever they want.
8165140	8165600	Exactly.
8165740	8171704	Even if you had nothing to do with the Sony hack, if you get caught hacking Square Enix's website, you'll be the Sony hacker.
8172105	8172425	Watch.
8174989	8175510	Just saying.
8176492	8178295	I understand hackers gonna hack.
8178755	8182181	I've always said on the show, I'm not trying to infringe on your freedom to hack.
8182302	8182963	I'm just saying.
8184628	8185428	Watch it.
8185689	8190511	And I shouldn't say your freedom to hack because whoever hacked the Sony website did a fucked up thing and that's not acceptable.
8190751	8194293	You just totally made me think of Life of Brian.
8194733	8200437	It's like, well, you can't physically have babies, but we'll protect your right to have them.
8202157	8202978	Eric Idle's character.
8203078	8203258	Yes.
8203278	8205519	It's like, so we'll protect your right to hack.
8205619	8206640	You just can't hack.
8208175	8208395	Anyway.
8209495	8210016	Last one.
8210856	8218138	There is still no taco delivery service on the PSN now that it is partially... Now that it is partially... It has a sad... Clearly this is an email written in all caps.
8219699	8219919	Yeah.
8220219	8221259	That's from all caps Bobby.
8221840	8223960	All caps Bobby has a sad frown.
8225021	8225341	The end.
8226701	8227661	I saved it for last.
8231723	8232103	Alright.
8234059	8234760	That's it for emails.
8234800	8238184	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us.
8238204	8239866	But try to not use all caps.
8240426	8242108	I don't like it when Jamie reads all caps emails.
8242489	8242749	All right.
8243349	8245312	Loki, how about you?
8246664	8257132	Yes, apparently the Fox Entertainment Group has an FCC filing that points to possibly a new video service coming to consoles.
8258453	8270522	And they're saying that Fox Entertainment Group and its multi-channel video programming distribution partners have shown intent that they're planning on broadening their platforms that they offer content on.
8271082	8280729	and that it will see subscription and on-demand video services available directly to wide-marketed consumer electronics devices such as game consoles sometime in the near future.
8282811	8289996	So, maybe something that will be announced later on, maybe something that's, you know, time of, like, a capable provider or something like that.
8290016	8292338	We'll have to see.
8294099	8294480	Hmm.
8294500	8294560	Hmm.
8296529	8299210	Don't we have enough video services on consoles at this point, though?
8299230	8299350	We do.
8299370	8299931	There's a lot.
8299971	8301611	Between Netflix and Hulu.
8301931	8305173	Although Hulu Plus kind of sucks because of their ads.
8305313	8309054	You know I'm not a fan of ads and paying for it.
8309634	8310875	It's one or the other, not both.
8313556	8315697	Anyhow, one other story for you guys tonight.
8315717	8317338	And then we're going to get into the Skype line.
8317378	8318579	Whoopee!
8318599	8319859	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8319919	8320560	Actually, I lie.
8320580	8323801	We're going to get into the FUs of the week and then the Skype line.
8323821	8325142	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8325182	8332786	But first, let me read this quick story about Kid Icarus Uprising, which of course is the 3DS Kid Icarus game that's coming out soon.
8333806	8334327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8351201	8364466	Some other stuff that's coming out of this though is that Nintendo is going to be using fan Miis on a float that will show up at the Goshogawara Tachi Neputa Festival that happens in August.
8365206	8375750	Miis will be joining Pit and Patena and there's a whole page in Japanese on how you can create a Mii on your 3DS, save it and send it into Nintendo.
8377210	8380312	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8405942	8407823	So yay, me's on parade!
8407903	8408563	Woohoo!
8409524	8412466	Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week before I forget.
8412546	8414507	Every week on this show we do a little bit of ranting.
8429935	8431116	Fuck you to WBTV.
8432748	8433068	Logi.
8449605	8456250	Fuck you to my new portable hard drive that's USB powered for deleting said data on portable hard drive.
8457291	8457892	One I didn't want to.
8457912	8459393	I was like, why is this not working?
8459413	8460234	And then I looked on it.
8460414	8461475	Oh, it's empty.
8461915	8463336	Thanks.
8464257	8465298	You know, it's never doing that to me.
8466118	8467780	Yeah, I think I blame partly my 360.
8468100	8471263	I had to create a 360 data partition in it.
8471623	8475206	Well, not really a data partition, but usually they'll do it without erasing any data.
8475626	8476627	But it decided.
8477007	8479009	But you used mine and mine was fine.
8479795	8484561	Yeah, but my 360 was being retarded and didn't want to see the drive until I did that.
8484741	8485822	Now it finally sees the drive.
8486062	8487644	Oh, too bad.
8487965	8488946	Yeah, I'm sorry.
8490788	8494132	My FU of the week goes to Loki because he doesn't like Lady Gaga.
8494612	8495173	She's brilliant.
8497075	8497596	He's a hater.
8499597	8502061	If that's my FU of the week, then that means things are going pretty good.
8502101	8503584	How about FU to Headaches?
8504345	8508572	Because I had a bad one yesterday and I kind of was antisocial at a party because of it and that's never any fun.
8508873	8509894	I don't like being antisocial.
8510696	8511137	That sucks.
8512339	8513060	And then FU to Loki.
8513516	8516340	All right, let's get to the Skype line.
8516360	8519984	1-877-GAME-OLR Every week we give you guys a chance to call in and share your voices.
8520285	8520605	You know what?
8520645	8523288	Sometimes it's the same people that call every week, and that's fine.
8523829	8525431	It's open for all right now.
8525491	8528014	I'm actually really proud of this line, and I would like to read it from my email.
8528094	8529316	Sure, go ahead, because the phone's not ringing yet.
8529336	8529997	It's item number five.
8530377	8530578	Yes.
8531058	8532340	Do you want to hear my email so far?
8533460	8534340	Alright, sure, what the hell.
8534380	8535781	But I'm cutting you off as soon as the call comes in.
8536081	8539261	To whom it may concern, first and foremost, I am an adult, a fan of video games, and female.
8539341	8546082	I am friends with several adopted friends who were shocked you gave attention to the single person Okay.
8547022	8548163	I need to rephrase that.
8548263	8549863	Basically, I've got friends that are adopted that play Portal.
8550063	8550463	Don't care.
8550483	8551263	Okay.
8551883	8555544	I said my friends play Portal too with me and think adoption jokes are just as funny.
8555564	8557004	Oh, I'm cutting you off because you're getting a phone call.
8557044	8561105	Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAVE-OLR Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8561125	8561425	Who's this?
8562085	8562866	Hey, this is X-Link.
8562926	8564066	Hey, X-Link, how you doing?
8564507	8565227	Hey, doing good.
8565327	8569069	I want to call in and chime in for a minute about Blizzard and their customer service.
8569109	8581077	Somebody said they didn't like the way they were doing it, but actually, every time when I have talked to somebody through the customer service through very few problems I had, of course, playing WoW and whatnot, I had really good service, including an item that I ordered from their store.
8582199	8582619	Do tell.
8582779	8585201	Share a little more about your positive experience.
8585221	8587343	Because we often have a lot of negativity.
8587363	8588283	So let's hear something good.
8588844	8590285	Well, I'll talk about the store.
8591205	8597170	Somehow with my PayPal account, instead of putting the right address, which was on there, they somehow got my old address.
8598130	8599451	This was before I moved.
8599671	8601493	And before I got changed, I didn't realize it.
8601613	8604695	So I realized it the night after the order was placed.
8605626	8634635	I called in but unfortunately the package had already shipped so they had to wait for it to try to be delivered and then they can cancel so they whoever was at the door thank god there was nobody there living there in my old apartment at the time so it got sent back to them but they were they not only replaced the old package with a new one but they also refunded the money to my account which I thought was a little odd but hey it was you know so I technically got the item for free but
8635802	8651352	The guy who walked me through and tried to help me as much as he could, not only did he do it through the phone in a very positive and nice fashion, but also kept up with quarterly, like almost every few hours by email, which was very nice.
8651632	8654093	And I mean, he did flood the mailbox like every three to four hours.
8654193	8658256	It's like one email in the morning, one email in the evening saying, here's what we got.
8658276	8659456	Here's what we're going to do.
8659957	8660577	Here's what the game is.
8660597	8661878	So constant communication.
8661898	8661978	Yeah.
8662378	8662859	Yes, yes.
8677641	8679743	It's not okay for the two lines to be crossed.
8680083	8682985	However, I trained for nine years in customer service.
8683025	8687067	I trained for a large, large call center here in the area on customer service.
8687148	8693532	And I'll tell you, one of the things that we were really big on was making sure that information was always communicated to the customer.
8693552	8702718	Communication is so key, I think, because people don't call into places or email or whatever to hear, I don't know, or there's nothing we can do about that.
8703178	8704379	They want it resolution.
8704599	8706540	That's why you pick up the phone and call somebody in the first place.
8708082	8730400	and it was it was really cool because he's like yes sir no sir and he had a very positive attitude it's like it's like almost that he was like talking to my talk to like a best friend or a good friend about something he's like yeah you know hey it happens you know no problem let me look into it uh hey what's the got place to unfold um i promise i'll be right back and if i don't i got your information right here i'll call you right back and we'll walk we'll try to see what we can do
8730880	8747092	and it was very nice and a lot of companies most times when you call it's kind of like I don't care I'm just going to do it's more robotic and you know it's like why did I do this in the first place when I'm just going to do this through email and just probably get the same response so
8747884	8752367	Well, look, I don't know what Holly's thing is with Blizzard right now.
8752387	8753168	I don't know specifically.
8753188	8756730	Well, I might, but I wouldn't try to tell it on the show for somebody else anyway.
8757090	8759872	But I can tell you where I come from.
8760933	8762174	Obviously, we play WoW together.
8762214	8763074	You know I love WoW.
8764195	8767117	I wouldn't have a fucking podcast about WoW if I didn't love World of Warcraft.
8767417	8775222	But sometimes I get a little negative on Horde House because Blizzard just makes these decisions as a corporation that you just look at it and your jaw is just dropped.
8775242	8776283	Like, what the fuck are you doing?
8777964	8778704	Let me give you an analogy.
8778744	8779065	Wait, hold on.
8779105	8779945	Let me give you an analogy.
8780205	8785188	Okay, like let's assume you've got a friend and like, you know, this is your bro.
8785248	8786348	He's your guy.
8786628	8789310	He's one of your best friends, you know, whatever.
8789990	8797174	And suddenly this guy starts dating this girl and you just don't like her because she's drama and she just –
8798154	8798414	ActaVision
8827904	8837032	There's been times when I've seen some of the stuff they're supposedly going to do inside the game, and I'm looking at the stuff and announcements, I'm like, what the fuck are they doing with this shit?
8837112	8841716	Seriously, are they going to actually make us pay for all this stuff that should be free in the first place?
8842497	8848262	And I love listening to other people's, also other people's podcasts, of course, I listen to yours too, Rob.
8848894	8878230	but it's kind of funny hearing that people come up like you would say something and you'd be like okay I can't believe Blizzard's doing this what the fuck and then somebody else on the same line going you know what I think Blizzard's going overboard with this and this is stupid and I can't believe they're actually doing this because they're trying to get more money into the pot so to speak so I think they could do a lot of this stuff or you know everything doesn't have to be quote unquote a premium fee I think that's taking a little overboard
8878490	8883414	And you know what's funny is that, yet again, we have a case of the worker bee is doing a great job.
8883434	8886476	And the worker bee, in this case, being the customer service reps you interact with.
8886496	8888097	They're representing their company very well.
8888358	8891920	The problem, when we talk about issues we have with Blizzard, it is not with the worker bees.
8892441	8893742	It's with the queen bee.
8893982	8896324	It's with the people up top that are making the decisions.
8896364	8897705	And you're just... Don't hit your head.
8897945	8898325	I can't.
8899706	8900347	Face palm.
8900867	8903749	Give me that picture of Captain Jean-Luc Picard face palming.
8903989	8904450	Because that's...
8904870	8907975	God, half the stories I read on Horde House need that caption.
8908857	8910098	Any MMO Any MMO goes through this
8937669	8946948	and WoW just happens to be a big one but any MMO goes through this love-hate relationship with their fanbase, my god, look at Final Fantasy XIV right now, hello like the same problem
8947677	8948117	What, Rob?
8948237	8948777	Final what?
8948997	8949738	Yeah, exactly.
8950538	8951158	Oh, okay.
8951818	8952818	So, all right.
8953378	8955539	Anyhow, I got to wrap up so we can get more calls.
8955839	8956539	But thank you so much.
8956619	8957499	Anything really quick.
8958080	8958500	Really quick.
8958540	8958880	What's up?
8959640	8961000	No, anything else real quick you want to get out?
8961020	8961420	No, no, no.
8961541	8961961	Nothing else.
8962141	8962641	All right, then bye.
8964101	8965562	I'm going to read you the line that I'm proud of.
8965822	8966542	Okay, go for it.
8966562	8966822	Okay.
8967202	8967722	Did I hang up?
8967802	8968442	I think I hung up.
8968542	8968702	No.
8969483	8969823	Hang up.
8970343	8970563	Hang up.
8974222	8974782	Did I hang up?
8974942	8980006	Nope.
8980446	8981307	Okay.
8981387	8984929	The character in the game is, as admitted by one of the other antagonists, a moron.
8986250	8991834	The same antagonist is a passive-aggressive homicidal computer that takes steps to discourage the character being played, not the player.
8992234	8996277	There's also insults slung out towards overweight people and those of lower than average intelligence.
8996917	8998558	Should they also rise up in protest?
8998858	9002761	Should the fatties and morons also call your station and expect the same coverage as the adoptive parents?
9005919	9012626	You know what, that's a very good point that the story overlooks, is that the character is supposed to be a moron.
9013767	9013948	Yeah.
9013988	9016370	This is not somebody you're supposed to model yourself after.
9016771	9018172	This is an idiot bully.
9019333	9026541	As it said in the game, designed by the greatest minds of their generation to create the dumbest moron who ever lived.
9027085	9027525	Interesting.
9027765	9028746	I like that perspective.
9028786	9029666	That's pretty cool.
9029686	9033967	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9034007	9036088	And maybe I'll try to hang up on you and not succeed.
9038348	9041269	I would ask if there's any last minute stories, but Loki left the room real quick.
9041389	9043690	I think he's chatting with Dan about something real quick.
9043850	9045130	Is he chatting up my men?
9045290	9045771	I think so.
9045811	9048051	They're doing gaming something in the living room.
9048731	9050272	Don't do anything kinky in there!
9051492	9052413	Without taking pictures.
9052893	9053833	It's only porn if you tape it.
9054656	9055457	All right, Loki's coming back.
9056157	9056978	What are you doing, Loki?
9057639	9058780	He's chatting up my husband.
9058900	9059160	Sorry.
9059340	9060501	All right.
9060801	9061662	Last minute stories?
9061782	9062043	Yes.
9062463	9062663	Okay.
9063144	9068508	Well, real quick, there's some leaked video that kind of shows off some of the new features for FIFA 12.
9069789	9070590	It looks kind of neat.
9070610	9072212	They're kind of making it more realistic.
9072332	9079498	Now they have... Apparently, you can do some... They have unexpected behaviors that will happen.
9079518	9080399	Like, for example...
9081880	9086261	You know, a defender coming in, offensive player making a move that flips the player.
9088221	9094022	You know, apparently you can get injuries and realistic injuries.
9094523	9103684	They're going to have better dribbling and basically kind of a whole new engine that they're putting in place here.
9104024	9105705	Let me get to the phone because we've got another call coming in.
9105745	9106565	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry.
9106585	9106885	Who's this?
9108294	9109274	Yo guys, it's Unicorn.
9109334	9109975	Long time no see.
9110015	9110375	How y'all doing?
9110395	9111395	Yes, it has been a while.
9111435	9112136	How are you doing, buddy?
9112756	9114617	Just trying to make that paper, you know.
9116077	9116618	Make it rain.
9116638	9117258	Alright, what's up?
9117938	9118579	Not much, man.
9118619	9119019	Not much.
9119119	9122080	Just blowing some time trying to get through L.A.
9122140	9125021	Noire without cursing my head off and waking up the entire neighborhood.
9125181	9126342	Tell us a little bit about L.A.
9126402	9126802	Noire.
9126922	9128263	I actually have a question real quick.
9128463	9129563	Is time enjoying being blown?
9130524	9130724	Stop.
9131044	9131284	All right.
9131304	9132184	L.A.
9132225	9132385	Noire.
9132405	9133245	You're a dirty girl.
9133725	9134565	Yes, I am.
9134665	9135066	Yes, I am.
9135106	9136206	She's off the hook tonight.
9136266	9136526	All right.
9137407	9139227	Talking about L.A.
9139267	9146050	Noire a little bit because it's not a game I've played yet because I didn't think it would be something I was interested in because I'm not super into the whole Grand Theft Auto thing.
9146250	9148031	It's cool and all, but I'm just not very good at it.
9148371	9156274	But in listening to Bobby's show before us tonight, he doesn't really play these types of games either, but his callers are like, no, dude, this is like a throwback to an adventure game.
9156754	9157755	What do you think of L.A.
9157775	9158075	Noire?
9158797	9161020	Oh, so you guys actually haven't covered it on your show yet.
9162602	9165765	I thought I was chasing behind all my shows I'm trying to get in touch with.
9165786	9166867	Can I ask you a question?
9167367	9171532	Do you find the period specificness of the game a little bit bothersome?
9172253	9173455	No, actually I enjoy it.
9174454	9174754	Okay.
9175934	9182156	Well, I didn't know what Dan was playing at the time, and then I was hearing the guy make in the comments about Jews, and I was like, what the hell are you playing?
9183017	9183957	Oh, yeah, that first game.
9183997	9185077	I didn't even think of that.
9185637	9186798	He's quite livid, he is.
9186918	9189599	Oh, you should call the local news media and tell them how offended you were.
9189619	9189939	You know what?
9190159	9193360	I don't give a shit, because it's a period-specific game.
9193720	9196861	I just didn't know what he was playing at the time, so I was like, what the hell are you listening to?
9197455	9200317	Yeah, that guy is a racist, so of course he's going to curse it up a bit.
9201058	9203319	Well, anyway, so let me get back to the game a little bit.
9203800	9205621	I mean, I can't say we haven't covered L.A.
9205661	9206141	Noire on the show.
9206161	9206882	I mean, we've talked about it.
9206902	9208263	It's just none of us have yet to play it.
9208723	9211525	So we can't tell you how it is as a game.
9211605	9213066	So I'm relying on you, my friend.
9213106	9213586	How is L.A.
9213907	9214947	Noire as a game?
9214987	9215688	Tell us a little bit about it.
9216158	9222545	All right, let me set it up so I can describe it and be as rhetorical as possible, but you get all the information in there.
9223907	9232796	It plays like Grand Theft Auto, but it doesn't play like Grand Theft Auto in the fact that you are a police officer and you're not supposed to run amok, which is the whole game.
9233057	9235099	The focus is on police investigation.
9236511	9239136	and the process of police investigation.
9239837	9247270	And the highlighting of the facial animations and using that to be able to tell if people are lying or not is the main focus of the game.
9248604	9251885	So it's CSI 1940s, basically.
9252105	9254906	Sounds like Law and Order in 1940s.
9255146	9256586	Yeah, it's exactly what that is.
9256666	9257726	All it needs is dong dong.
9259767	9267409	I mean, this game, if you're not going to cheat your way through it and use the online stuff, it truly is a mental game.
9267489	9268749	You have to think your way through it.
9269069	9275491	And you can still get through the game and still fail left and right, but you will get a completely different experience because you didn't really...
9276871	9299644	if you investigate a person and you're able to draw information out of them you have more things to use and search for later on in the case until you come to the end of it so am I hearing you right that you can't really lose this game it's just that there will be hallways you never go down if you don't do it well correct interesting yeah so the replay is in trying to do the cases better
9301098	9301618	DarkSakura.com
9328936	9329616	I'm having a ball.
9329637	9331577	I even slip into jargon every once in a while.
9333498	9335779	But that's the way we are in the house here, role players.
9335799	9338160	They've got to flex their role play muscles.
9338880	9340241	That's the life of a pig, man.
9340281	9341241	You've just got to deal with it.
9342782	9346783	This game was on my radar, certainly, because everybody's been talking about it.
9346803	9348764	But I was like, oh, it's a rock star game.
9349344	9350985	I don't usually feel those so much.
9351045	9351745	Whatever.
9351785	9354126	I'm sure they're great games, but I'll never probably get into it.
9354486	9354947	DarkSakura.com
9378385	9382227	So like all the billboards are where they're supposed to be and all this other stuff.
9382868	9386470	I was going to say, I'll get the anagram in our chat room.
9386490	9388051	It says, this sounds like Ace Attorney.
9388251	9388651	Interesting.
9388711	9391033	Is it like a Phoenix Wright type thing?
9391113	9394294	Yeah, it's actually closer to that than anything else.
9394394	9396116	You do have to drive from point to point.
9396396	9399497	And they add the Grand Theft Auto things by responding to calls.
9399538	9402419	You'll hear a call for officer needs support, this and that.
9402739	9406702	You roll up on a bank robbery or somebody's trying to rob a convenience store.
9407563	9410450	You know, Officers and Chase, you gotta cut them off.
9410750	9414639	I mean, that's all in there, as well as your standard stuff of driving your car.
9415060	9415221	But...
9416172	9417833	The focus is on the investigation itself.
9417873	9426819	Like, for instance, for example, one of the cases involves a woman and her niece getting put in a car while they're drugged and the car goes over a cliff.
9427359	9428240	But they survive it.
9428640	9430982	So you do your interviews to figure out what's going on.
9431482	9436966	You later on tail her and figure out she's got ties to the mob and she's going after the guy that drugged them and put them in the car.
9437686	9451225	if you don't get to the spot if you get there in time you can catch them in the act of trying to toss the place and arrest them if you don't if you take too long to get there you have to deal with the aftermath and you have to use your CSI skills to figure out what they were looking for
9452756	9479726	so yeah it's the way they put the gameplay in there plus later on the order that you investigate the locations determines who's available when so if you go to like for instance there's this grocery you have to investigate but for some reason they're closed until like 2-3 o'clock in the afternoon so if you go there too early you'll miss your chance to do something else like catch this one guy while he's in the bar you have to go hunt him down later yeah so the entire case is interwoven like that like a big twist-a-plot but
9480134	9484036	Let me ask you another question real quick before we let you go because I want to make sure we can free up for more calls.
9484096	9490519	But I've heard a lot about how this game really seems to be pushing that line between game and movie.
9490559	9493761	Like I've heard about some cases where it's actually being considered art.
9493841	9498624	I think somebody, I don't know, some gallery or something was actually kind of putting this game on display or what have you.
9499024	9500264	What do you think about this game?
9500304	9509069	Is this game really pushing the envelope between what is a movie, television, visual art, and a video game, which not everyone considers art if you're Roger Ebert?
9509676	9511277	Well, let me say it like this.
9512037	9515319	I was watching, you guys familiar with Red Letter Media?
9516899	9517200	No.
9517640	9524183	Okay, Red Letter Media is the guys that went behind Mr. Plinkett and ripping apart the Star Wars trilogy.
9524203	9526704	Their movies, their reviews are extremely in-depth.
9526964	9533247	And they started up a show, and they mentioned the fact that movies have become the lowest form of entertainment.
9534156	9538600	as far as outlook and what you expect from them.
9538860	9541823	Some people aren't willing to throw $10 at a bad movie.
9542403	9548288	And the way movies have been going now, maybe they're not making as much money as they could be if they're spending more time writing scripts and stuff.
9548668	9550010	They are doing that in gaming.
9550110	9553352	So that has stepped up as far as the public eye is looking for entertainment.
9553633	9556395	And this is just going to add fuel to that fire.
9556715	9557656	The fact that the...
9559440	9570952	Facial expressions add so much to the way you're trying to... I mean, literally, I was second guessing almost every decision I was making on whether these people were lying or not based off what I knew about the case.
9571273	9572414	And it was driving me nuts.
9573743	9574303	Interesting.
9574503	9582826	And the way they added, there's a small audio cue that lets you know whether or not you picked if they're telling the truth, if you doubt their answer, or if they're flat out lying.
9583166	9588668	They have a little three-note piano thing that lets you know when you pick correctly, incorrectly, the instant you push the button.
9588728	9592369	So it just adds to that suspense when you're waiting to hear that tone.
9593169	9596931	And when you miss it up, you just want to go rage comic all over the thing, but it's great.
9597171	9598131	I love every minute of it.
9598342	9600463	Alright, well you guys have sold me that I need to check it out.
9600563	9603684	I don't know if I'll drop $60 for it, but I'm certainly going to rent it and check it out.
9603744	9605325	Yeah, definitely worth the rental.
9605425	9606265	Alright, absolutely.
9606525	9609807	Alright, Xenocore, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but take care and thanks for calling.

9652853	9664719	They have... Kenji Unifune is actually in the new Japanese RPG Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2.
9664799	9672904	It's the sequel to the Hyperdimension Neptunia game that came out, I believe, last year and over here in March.

9676406	9677146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9694554	9695194	But it's weird.
9696414	9696734	All right.

9715058	9715839	We'll see you in two weeks.
9715859	9717499	What are you going to do with the week off?
9721376	9732980	I'm going to be sad that the season of Supernatural is over for two whole weeks and then go back to the episode where Sam had no shirt and no soul.
9733980	9735281	This is all about just what...
9736121	9737302	Get you going tonight.
9764269	9769186	Don't hate, my friend had to wait in line for four hours Not hating, I'm not hating, but you have to bring me back a Duffy
9769884	9770945	I'm not bringing you back a Duffy.
9771025	9772987	Maybe I'll bring you back a Star Wars preview or something.
9773007	9773907	You know I'm teasing.
9773927	9774568	If you're a good girl.
9774948	9775569	You know I'm teasing.
9775689	9775889	All right.
9776449	9778131	And Loki, your final thought tonight?
9779212	9783135	Hopefully I'll play some more games this week other than Grand Theft Auto.
9783255	9783815	That would be nice.
9783835	9786638	And what are you going to do with the week off?
9787038	9792503	I have an invite to go to the new members party for Mensa, but I don't know if I'm going to.
9792523	9793443	You've got to go to that.
9794844	9798845	God, I can only imagine the type of people that are there.
9799865	9801525	We want pictures of hot Mensa chicks.
9804086	9804506	Come on.
9804586	9806886	I'm sorry, I'm just picturing old... Look at that Mensa booty!
9807306	9811267	I just pictured old people playing cards and boring card games.
9811407	9812527	You don't want to play Bunko?
9813127	9816028	It's not Bunko, they're like playing... Canasta.
9816108	9817728	Cribbage and hearts.
9817888	9818608	Dan plays Cribbage.
9818628	9820349	I can play Cribbage, I can be a Mensa.
9820489	9821809	I'll play Cribbage with Mensa people.
9822649	9822909	Alright.
9827355	9828898	I joined up just to get the plaque.
9828918	9830300	That's really what it was all about.
9830800	9835207	Now that I have the plaque hanging at my desk at work, the rest is all optional.
9835768	9837689	Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.
9837729	9839270	Sorry guys that there won't be a show next week.
9839290	9840691	We hope this is enough to hold you over.
9840991	9841672	Look forward to this.
