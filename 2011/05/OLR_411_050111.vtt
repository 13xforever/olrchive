00:00.000 --> 00:19.260
Today, May 1st, 2011, the PlayStation Network remains down after an entire week, Portal

00:19.260 --> 00:31.900
2 plans free DLC and Nintendo plans a free game from the 3DS shop.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.280 --> 00:39.200
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.200 --> 00:47.280
We are live with episode number 411, the 411 if you will, on this May 1st of 2011.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.300
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, with

00:50.300 --> 00:53.560
me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.960
I will not put you in a potato.

00:55.960 --> 00:56.960
Thank you.

00:56.960 --> 00:57.960
And feed you two birds.

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
That's great.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.680
Actually it's kind of funny because I saw, I was at Trader Joe's today, which by the

01:02.680 --> 01:08.000
way, super crowded grocery store today, it was a madhouse, and there was some hash browns

01:08.000 --> 01:12.120
that were on sale and the little label on it says, when I grow up, I want to be hash

01:12.120 --> 01:15.620
browns and I couldn't help but think of, you know, the same thing.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.880
So anyhow.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.400
I gave inadvertent spoilers today, sorry.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.440
And the one she was spoiling of course was the one and only tech master, Loki!

01:24.440 --> 01:25.840
I asked, so it's alright.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
That's right, yeah.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.320
Let's keep the show spoiler free guys, don't worry about it.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.320
How you doing, Loki?

01:29.320 --> 01:30.320
I'm doing fine.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.040
And long time no see, it's been a little while because we were off two weeks ago and then

01:34.040 --> 01:38.440
last week, Easter week, you were like, oh, I gotta do family stuff because I have a baby

01:38.440 --> 01:41.480
now, so family stuff's important, so whatever, Loki.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.640
So, well how's it going?

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
It's going alright.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.320
Any, uh, anything exciting going on with the baby and that whole stuff?

01:49.320 --> 01:54.000
He's scooting forward now, which means he'll be crawling hopefully soon.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.120
Awesome.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.520
I saw the video.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.160
He looks so proud of himself.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.680
He is very proud of himself.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.680
He's like, I can move!

02:02.680 --> 02:04.400
Just wait till I start walking!

02:04.400 --> 02:08.900
Today he learned how to smack mommy in the face when she's not listening and gave her

02:08.900 --> 02:09.900
a bloody nose.

02:09.900 --> 02:10.900
Oh no.

02:10.900 --> 02:11.900
What?

02:11.900 --> 02:12.900
Oh no.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.080
No, he, he just got, he gets excited sometimes and he, he's like flails around and you know.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.040
He still doesn't have fine motor control.

02:20.040 --> 02:25.400
Whoever's holding him is, you know, subjected to the brunt of his attack.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.960
Has he tugged on your face?

02:26.960 --> 02:31.560
No, he does it all the time.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.800
Alright well, we're going to start off the show of course with how was your gaming week

02:35.800 --> 02:37.320
and the video games you've been playing this week.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.920
However, I do want to of course introduce the chat room because they're always there

02:39.920 --> 02:40.920
with us.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.780
You can go to chat.orangelauntrader.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night

02:43.780 --> 02:46.400
where gamers seem to be very opinionated this week.

02:46.400 --> 02:52.520
I can't possibly imagine what could possibly have so many people with so many polarizing

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
opinions.

02:53.520 --> 02:58.000
It couldn't be that we're on day 11 of a certain network being down, which is certainly the

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
longest anything like this has ever happened.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.600
Oh my god, UPN's down?

03:01.600 --> 03:02.600
UPN's down?

03:02.600 --> 03:07.520
UPN merged with C, what is it, Warner Brothers years ago, just so you know.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.640
Alright, anyhow.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.560
All that aside, certainly, we'll get into that, but first, a little lighter fare, how

03:13.560 --> 03:15.640
was your gaming week and what games you've been playing this week?

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
DarkSakura.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.680
I've been playing a lot of stuff.

03:18.680 --> 03:24.360
I played DDR on Wednesday, I went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza, which was actually

03:24.360 --> 03:26.100
pretty good.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.320
So I cannot call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza anymore.

03:29.320 --> 03:35.400
It was Julian's 4th birthday, and so we did the twister and everything, and he was a big

03:35.400 --> 03:36.560
boy and went on that.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.480
John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.840
It was actually pretty good.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.200
It was actually really good.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.340
They're Alfredo Pizza, it was pretty good.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.820
How long has it been since you've had pizza?

03:46.820 --> 03:48.860
It was pretty good.

03:48.860 --> 03:52.280
Because I managed to get those both when they were fresh, the pizzas I had.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.200
I'm a pizza snob and I think their pizza's terrible, but that's because I haven't had

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
it in a while.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.200
But anyway.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.200
Foodio.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.200
I like the macaroni and cheese pizza.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.800
By the way, speaking of food, would you please tell the listeners what you had before the

04:02.800 --> 04:03.920
show tonight?

04:03.920 --> 04:06.480
I had a fish taco.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.720
Thank you, Rob, for my taco.

04:08.720 --> 04:13.640
And dammit people, I asked for more than 10, not more than 30.

04:13.640 --> 04:18.960
And yeah, if you have no idea why Dark Soccer was rewarded with a taco earlier tonight,

04:18.960 --> 04:20.200
you have to listen to last week's show.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.840
I just like that I completely bullshitted you into getting me a taco.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.120
I was kind of fucked up.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.560
Next time I want something.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.560
Rob.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.560
What?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.440
How about after the show I get you paintberry?

04:30.440 --> 04:33.560
That would be amazing if I didn't have work in the morning, and I already foresee this

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
show running long.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.720
Okay, how about after my finals are done?

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
Okay.

04:37.720 --> 04:38.720
We go celebrate at paintberry.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.720
My treat.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
That works for me.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
Okay.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
Sorry, back to games.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
I'll buy Alan some too.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.720
Okay.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.720
So.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.880
I played some Ditter, and I played this percussion master game that's supposed to be like Taiko

04:48.880 --> 04:53.520
no Tatsujin, only it's a lot different and kind of sucky, and had really bad covers of

04:53.520 --> 04:54.520
songs in there.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.320
But I had fun playing it.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.960
And then I played After Burner Climax in the arcade, because that's the only arcade machine

05:01.960 --> 05:03.880
I've seen, and I love that game.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.840
Did it make you climax?

05:05.840 --> 05:09.160
No, but I was moist.

05:09.160 --> 05:16.720
Because, you know, I just got done playing DDR, I was like, okay.

05:16.720 --> 05:22.600
And then I got Portal 2, which I got two days ago.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.240
I got it Friday night.

05:24.240 --> 05:29.320
And I'm already almost caught up with you, because I had bad insomnia.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.520
My problem is that I'm only playing it on Steam, because, you know, I'm kind of glad

05:33.520 --> 05:41.200
I don't have the Playstation 1, because of certain malfunctions, and excuse me while

05:41.200 --> 05:45.320
I clean something up off the floor.

05:45.320 --> 05:49.760
So, and because, you know, I honestly wouldn't have played it on the console anyway, so I'm

05:49.760 --> 05:51.620
really digging playing it on Steam.

05:51.620 --> 05:54.520
I play with a trackball mouse, which I'm having a good time.

05:54.520 --> 06:01.040
But yeah, I have just found, well, it's a little bit of a spoiler, but I don't care,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.040
I'll say it anyway.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.360
It's called potatoes.

06:04.360 --> 06:08.280
As they refer to her on the Half-Life Wiki as potatoes.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.040
So it's been pretty cool.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.560
You've heard me bitching about puzzles that make me violently ill.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.000
Hey, it's my husband, I think.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
No, it's a visitor.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It's a friend.

06:20.000 --> 06:29.680
Anyway, so, uh, I also, uh, crap, what else did I play?

06:29.680 --> 06:32.880
I played some Dragon Age, but I'm kind of forgetting about Dragon Age for now.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.720
I'm gonna go ahead and give it back, because I've got Portal, although I'm probably gonna

06:36.720 --> 06:39.240
end up having it beaten, like, in the next couple days.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.580
And I got level 60, um, for Rebecca Black.

06:42.580 --> 06:43.580
On WoW.

06:43.580 --> 06:44.580
On WoW.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.580
World of Warcraft.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.960
You still have to play co-op, because co-op's a lot of fun, too.

06:47.960 --> 06:48.960
Co-op WoW?

06:48.960 --> 06:49.960
No, co-op Portal, dummy.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.680
Don't call me dummy dummy.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.880
I booted Darwinia.

06:56.880 --> 07:01.800
But Portal, I'm kind of like, oooh, it's pretty.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.880
It really is pretty.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.400
I've been taking tons of screen captures, because my favorite thing in this game so

07:06.400 --> 07:14.960
far are the, um, the work posters that are like, but for me being, you know, a big graphic

07:14.960 --> 07:20.960
design nerd, I love how perfectly they capture the styles of each era, you know, the further

07:20.960 --> 07:25.920
along that you're in the facility, like the stuff from the 40s and 50s, and then the 60s

07:25.920 --> 07:32.600
style logo, and as you move up through the facility, and you come to the modern age,

07:32.600 --> 07:38.600
you see just, they really did capture the design of those different eras really nicely.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.520
And I love the allergen poster.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.240
It's like, know your allergens.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.240
Pollen.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.240
Pet dander.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
Plastic.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
Antimatter.

07:47.240 --> 07:55.280
And the, the, the, please let us know if you see anyone from the FDA, the FHA.

07:55.280 --> 07:59.620
There's lots of great little jokes just in the artwork, and that's, that's, you know,

07:59.620 --> 08:02.760
part of what makes this game so phenomenal is that, you know, there's just, you can just

08:02.760 --> 08:07.440
be kind of walking around looking at the scenery, and it's not just the, you know, very similar

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
to the first game.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.800
Remember how they were like the cave drawing type of things?

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
Which are still there.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.240
Yeah, they're there, and you know, they're not totally throughout, but you find them

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
in certain places.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
Well, you know why?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.240
The signs or jokes do.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.960
You know why they're not fully, fully through there?

08:20.960 --> 08:22.360
Can you tell me without spoiling?

08:22.360 --> 08:23.720
Well read the lab rat comic.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
Okay, alright.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.520
There's a comic that ties Portal to Portal 2 called Lab Rat.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.680
It's a free PDF.

08:29.680 --> 08:36.120
You can get it on the Valve website, and it talks about Ratman, who was the guy that was

08:36.120 --> 08:43.040
living in the facilities hiding, and he apparently was a scientist, and was, he's the reason

08:43.040 --> 08:45.320
that Chella's the one being tested.

08:45.320 --> 08:51.600
Because while she wasn't the smartest or the most athletic, she had the most tenacity.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.040
And it says on her, never ever gives up.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.880
So she was initially rejected as a test subject.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
And he moved her forward.

08:58.880 --> 08:59.880
And this is all in the comic.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.880
Yeah, all in the comic.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.360
So you're just spoiling the comic, not the game.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.240
Well, there's more to it.

09:04.240 --> 09:10.140
Like there's a lot more to Ratman, and there's a lot more to her, and just different stuff

09:10.140 --> 09:11.140
that goes on in there.

09:11.140 --> 09:15.180
So it's actually pretty, it's a good little tie-in, and also if you haven't seen the restored

09:15.180 --> 09:21.240
ending for Portal, that ties in as well.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.320
Coming into our chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Defective Candy is sad.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.840
I'm poor, I can't buy Portal.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.280
You're probably not alone.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.480
And it's inevitable there will be a huge sale on Steam at some point.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.200
And I would anticipate it's probably going to be around the time the first batch of download

09:34.200 --> 09:35.520
content comes out.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.000
It will be, you know, hey, are you still not on Portal?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.160
Get it now, half off.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.000
Because Valve likes to do ridiculous sales.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
So you know, not all the news is bad.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Portal's ten bucks right now.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
The only, well, I mean, Portal 2.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.360
Yeah, Portal 2, yeah.

09:47.360 --> 09:54.560
Well everybody can, you know, just watch their retail stores because they're doing POS backend

09:54.560 --> 10:02.400
rebates for retailers through now and I think June?

10:02.400 --> 10:03.460
Or the end of June?

10:03.460 --> 10:08.340
So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing it down to 30 or 40 bucks.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.960
What is a POS backend?

10:09.960 --> 10:15.520
POS backend rebate means point of sale, so each, basically they get it for cheaper.

10:15.520 --> 10:21.520
Each one they sell, they track how many they sell and they get a rebate from the publisher

10:21.520 --> 10:22.520
for it.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.200
So it's an incentive to get them to bring in more product because they get to sell it

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
for cheaper.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.120
Just sort of like buying a mask, buying bulk, right?

10:31.120 --> 10:32.160
Well, sort of.

10:32.160 --> 10:38.040
That's what happened with those, the five retailers that had the Wii systems for $170

10:38.040 --> 10:40.040
because that wasn't offered to everybody.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.860
That was only the top five direct retailers got offered that.

10:43.860 --> 10:48.840
But with Portal 2, it's a little bit flexible, so they're getting a week where they get the

10:48.840 --> 10:49.840
market down.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.780
So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing down different weeks from

10:53.780 --> 10:55.960
now to the end of June.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
Tiger Claw says, let's not forget about Cave Johnson.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.080
He has some of the funniest stuff.

11:00.080 --> 11:04.520
I love him and I didn't realize it at first, but it's the dude that played J. Jonah Jameson

11:04.520 --> 11:07.320
in the Spiderman movies and he's perfect.

11:07.320 --> 11:16.160
And I love Carolyn, which I won't say anything more about her, but I knew right away it was

11:16.160 --> 11:17.640
the same voice actor.

11:17.640 --> 11:23.360
So I love her speaking voice, but I love listening to her sing.

11:23.360 --> 11:29.240
Not just the Jonathan Colton songs, but singing like she actually did the opera.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.240
She's an operatic singer.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.520
So I've actually gone back and listened to her sing other stuff and her voice is astounding.

11:34.520 --> 11:38.800
Really, really gorgeous.

11:38.800 --> 11:43.800
So really most of my time has been taken up with Portal 2.

11:43.800 --> 11:49.240
For all of my motion sickness, I have been breezing through it, except for the parts

11:49.240 --> 11:53.280
that I scream and yell at, which are usually, oh my God, I threw up.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.040
You said something on Facebook the other night about having played for a little bit, but

11:58.040 --> 12:00.060
got too motion sick and you had to quit.

12:00.060 --> 12:03.520
And I was kind of like, oh, she probably only got, you know, maybe she got through like

12:03.520 --> 12:05.080
the first two chapters or something.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.080
But no, I'm here tonight.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.080
You're already on chapter seven.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.080
Yeah.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.080
I just started chapter seven.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.080
So you almost caught up to me.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.080
I just got to chapter eight last night.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.080
So.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.880
Which I'm just a few stages away from that really.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.500
And I'm, I'm totally digging it.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.360
The last fight though, I'm, I'm not going to spoil it because I did actually watch play

12:22.360 --> 12:23.680
throughs a few times.

12:23.680 --> 12:28.180
The last fight looks freaking difficult, but fun too at the same time.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.680
So I'm looking forward to that.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
All right.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.760
Well, uh, if that does it for dark soccer's gaming week, then let's go to Loki and ask

12:33.760 --> 12:34.760
Loki.

12:34.760 --> 12:35.760
How was your gaming week?

12:35.760 --> 12:40.080
Um, I didn't play a lot of anything actually just grand theft auto really cause I've been

12:40.080 --> 12:44.440
playing, um, well I've been editing stuff in grand theft auto.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.560
That's all I really been doing the last two weeks.

12:46.560 --> 12:52.800
Um, well actually I did play like a few other small things, just mainly, um, play a little

12:52.800 --> 12:58.580
bit of unpleasant horse, which is the new iOS game from, um, pop cap.

12:58.580 --> 13:02.600
It's their, um, kind of spin off company that's doing it.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.960
And it's funny because I don't know if there's more of these types of games coming.

13:05.960 --> 13:10.480
I think there are, um, it's free, but what the premise of the game, the way they came

13:10.480 --> 13:15.440
up with it is they had a hat with a bunch of random names in it, just different parts

13:15.440 --> 13:16.440
of a name.

13:16.440 --> 13:22.400
And so they pull out the name for the game and they have 48 hours to complete the, you

13:22.400 --> 13:25.400
know, coding the game.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.040
And so the premise of unpleasant horse is you're this unpleasant looking unicorn fat

13:30.040 --> 13:37.700
chubby horse and, uh, you fly around or hop from cloud to cloud trying to land on happy

13:37.700 --> 13:45.680
white, um, unicorn horses or whatever Pegasus is, I guess, and you crush them and make them

13:45.680 --> 13:49.240
fall into meat grinders.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.240
That's it.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
It's hilarious.

13:51.240 --> 13:57.560
Um, but yeah, definitely worth checking out since it's free and it's fun, especially if

13:57.560 --> 14:02.640
you like horse violence like I do.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.640
So that's it.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.440
Well, you know, we covered, um, was it fourth and battery?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.400
We covered that on the show a few weeks ago.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
Right?

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
Yeah.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.760
No, I remember the story about how it took a little while for them to get on the store,

14:12.760 --> 14:15.880
but yeah, I didn't even realize the game had actually come out.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.000
I, last I'd heard it had been delayed, so that's cool.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
And then, um, let's see what else, uh, it was a really cool, actually I just real quick,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.240
there was a really cool story in the, um, I was making the rounds on the blogs this

14:28.240 --> 14:30.960
week and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'll mention it here.

14:30.960 --> 14:35.920
I hear that PopCap designed some game as part of a make a wish thing for a nine year old.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.920
I thought that was very cool.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.680
Yeah, I think that's out there now to games of the aisle store too.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.680
It's very cool.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.960
I'm trying to think other stuff.

14:41.960 --> 14:48.520
Oh, I was going to mod my laptop because, um, these wonderful aces laptops are not meant

14:48.520 --> 14:54.920
for proper cooling and so I'm modding the back of it so I can play some more graphic

14:54.920 --> 14:58.480
intensive games without feeling like my lap is on fire.

14:58.480 --> 15:04.040
Um, and then, uh, let's see, other than gaming, I mentioned a few weeks back, and this is

15:04.040 --> 15:10.720
really hilarious, um, how I was taking a test or whatever to get into Mensa while I passed

15:10.720 --> 15:11.720
that test.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.280
So I'm in Mensa now.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
Congrats.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.000
I don't know what to say.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
So now what?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.400
What do you do as a Mensa member?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.280
Because now is that going to be your thing now?

15:21.280 --> 15:26.120
Your little MO on the show is that, well Rob, as a, as a member of Mensa, I think my opinion

15:26.120 --> 15:27.120
matters here.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.120
I need to tell you.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.120
Nothing.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.920
I just want the plaque or whatever.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.920
Your resume, right?

15:31.920 --> 15:32.920
Yes.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.920
You're wondering.

15:33.920 --> 15:34.920
Hang it up in your office.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.920
It's basically, yeah.

15:35.920 --> 15:36.920
There you go.

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
I don't know.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.240
I can attend a seminar if I want to or something, but go hang out with all the smart people.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.600
All I can say is I can analyze games.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.640
Where's your Mensa placard?

15:45.640 --> 15:46.640
Fucking Michael Pachter.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.640
Yeah, that's right.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.040
I don't think you have one.

15:49.040 --> 15:54.040
I guess my opinion means a little bit more than yours, so.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.040
Nice.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.840
Um, I was going to say you need to go to one of these Mensa conventions and I want to see

15:58.840 --> 15:59.840
some Mensa hotties.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.840
Mensa hotties?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.360
I want to see a blog of Mensa hotties.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.640
You're going to be all like looking like librarians, I bet.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.040
That's now that's a stereotype, Dark Sakura.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.040
That is a stereotype.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.040
Vicious stereotype.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.040
Does Loki look like a librarian?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.040
I don't look like a librarian.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.040
I was talking about the women, but okay.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.040
Librarians are hot though.

16:17.040 --> 16:21.280
No, it's just, I just, I don't even know why I took the test.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.040
Sara Palin was kind of hot until she opened her mouth.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.340
Anyway.

16:26.340 --> 16:27.340
That all depends.

16:27.340 --> 16:31.040
I mean, your opinion of Sara Palin, I mean, it might be even hotter if she opened her

16:31.040 --> 16:37.340
mouth, but then when she started talking though, then that just went downhill.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.040
Some people like them stupid, I guess.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
No, I, I don't know.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.040
I just thought it was funny.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.040
But yeah.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
All right.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.040
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk about my gaming week.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.040
Oh, and I just did a, sorry, sorry.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.040
I just did a street pass thing with Rob.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.040
So now I actually have two me's on my 3DS now.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.040
Yay.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.940
That's the first time my 3DS is street pass.

16:55.940 --> 16:56.940
You know, it's awesome.

16:56.940 --> 16:58.740
I talked about getting the 3DS on the show last week.

16:58.740 --> 16:59.740
You know, it's awesome.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.740
I went to the mall yesterday.

17:01.740 --> 17:06.520
I went to the mall in the really nice part of town where all the spoiled rich kids are.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.520
I went there.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.020
I went to Best Buy.

17:09.020 --> 17:14.340
I went to some other stores and I was like, oh, I've got a street pass with someone.

17:14.340 --> 17:17.540
If it's like the demo unit in Best Buy, I'm going to street pass with someone before this

17:17.540 --> 17:18.540
day's over.

17:18.540 --> 17:23.840
I get home and I see, oh, uh, apparently the wireless was turned off the entire time.

17:23.840 --> 17:28.080
That was really smart of me because you know, they put the wireless switch on the 3DS exactly

17:28.080 --> 17:30.440
where they put the power switch on the old DS's.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.440
Yeah.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.440
God damn it.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.440
Anyhow.

17:34.440 --> 17:42.040
Oh, apparently I'm getting a link from Derek H in our chat room is actually linking us

17:42.040 --> 17:50.800
to this, uh, website here as a part of cha cha.com I like this, uh, hot Mensa members.

17:50.800 --> 17:56.040
And it's actually a link of some hot people that are Mensa members, some celebrities.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.480
Well, I guarantee I'm not part of that list.

17:59.480 --> 18:03.200
You are not because all these people have tits, Loki.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.240
You do not have tits.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.240
That's true.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.200
Derek H, Gina Davis, Asia Carrera.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.200
She's pretty hot.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.200
Uh, she's not hot.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.760
Well, Gina Davis is just getting old.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.760
She was really hot.

18:12.760 --> 18:13.760
Like 20 years ago.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.760
Well, that's 20 years ago.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.760
Anyhow.

18:15.760 --> 18:16.760
What the hell?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.480
Why do they have a little kid on there?

18:18.480 --> 18:19.480
That's just weird.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.480
All right.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.480
Let's move on.

18:21.480 --> 18:26.400
Uh, my gaming week, more of the same, uh, portal, of course, portal to, as I mentioned

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
before, I'm a chapter.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.760
I also play some co-op, uh, obviously not on PSM, but I played on steam, which was a

18:31.760 --> 18:32.760
lot of fun.

18:32.760 --> 18:36.400
And, uh, you know, we weren't using voice chat at all because, uh, I was playing with

18:36.400 --> 18:40.740
Miek Latov and the way his place is set up, he couldn't talk cause he would wake someone

18:40.740 --> 18:42.000
up who was sleeping.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.600
So, uh, I was, I was playing with him and we were using the text chat to type back and

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
forth.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.640
And then portal also has, if you use like the F key, you can like point at things like

18:50.640 --> 18:53.000
telling people where to put the portals.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
So it was nice.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.680
And like when I would get really frustrated, I'd hit F like a thousand times on the point

18:56.680 --> 18:59.160
where I want to, you know, have him put a portal.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
So that was fun.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.160
I like that.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
You each have a terminus?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.160
Uh, yeah.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
Oh yeah.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
You each, it's like four portals.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.600
All the co-op puzzles are four portals because you each have a portal guy.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.280
So it's not like one's not the orange and the other's the blue.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
Nope.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.440
One's dark blue and light blue and the other one's dark orange and like, or I should say

19:15.440 --> 19:17.500
light orange and red sort of thing.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
So yeah.

19:18.500 --> 19:22.120
I know that, um, in the original portal back, if you look at the beta pictures of it, they

19:22.120 --> 19:25.180
had a purple and pink portal originally.

19:25.180 --> 19:27.280
I was wondering if they maybe had borrowed the same scheme.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.280
Perhaps.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.280
I'm sure there's lots of ideas.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.180
Well, you know, at one point portal two wasn't even supposed to be half portals.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.920
That was one thing they were talking about was that it was going to be a whole new concept

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920
in their game.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.480
But actually that's where the gels come from, where there's like there's blue gels and orange

19:39.480 --> 19:40.480
gels and white gels.

19:40.480 --> 19:45.000
They got that from another game that was done by some more students at DigiPen.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Really?

19:46.000 --> 19:52.160
Um, that and there's only one gel that they didn't take from that game that is like a

19:52.160 --> 19:53.160
sticky, I think.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
I'd have to look it up again.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.680
But yeah, they took the repulsion and propulsion gel from another game and they actually hired

19:58.680 --> 20:00.040
them all to help work with portal two.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.160
The white gel is portal wall gel.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.160
Yeah.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.160
Moon rocks!

20:04.160 --> 20:06.400
You can have a portal wherever you want.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.560
So yeah, that wasn't supposed to have portals, but yeah, the game is still fun, exciting.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.560
Co-op mode is great.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.520
I haven't beat it yet, but we're probably like, I don't know, like think we're through

20:15.520 --> 20:17.400
three of the areas.

20:17.400 --> 20:21.040
So I think there's like five or six.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.360
Been playing a little bit of Mortal Kombat, but not a lot.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.680
A little more Street Fighter on the 3DS, but not a lot.

20:25.680 --> 20:30.960
The one new game I've been playing a lot of this week is the Final Fantasy IV collection

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
on the PSP.

20:31.960 --> 20:37.160
You might've forgot because it came out on a huge week, but that game came out and it's

20:37.160 --> 20:41.840
redone versions of Final Fantasy IV, which of course was originally released as Final

20:41.840 --> 20:45.640
Fantasy II in the United States, but it's IV in the canon.

20:45.640 --> 20:49.300
It is not only the original Final Fantasy IV game redone.

20:49.300 --> 20:55.160
It is redone in the style of Final Fantasy I and II on the PSP or I and II on the iPhone,

20:55.160 --> 20:59.040
which was taken from the PSP versions, not III, which was taken from the DS versions.

20:59.040 --> 21:03.200
But IV has been reimagined like I and II were with redone sprites, redone music.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.360
Really cool though, you can go in and enable the original music if you'd like to hear that.

21:07.360 --> 21:12.400
It's the modern translation, not the original Ted Woosley one from the 90s that's out.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
You spoonie bard!

21:13.400 --> 21:17.080
Well, they keep that line in, they have to keep that line in, but the rest is the proper

21:17.080 --> 21:23.040
story with all the proper text for everything.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.640
And it also has the After Years, the complete set of the After Years games, which were released

21:27.640 --> 21:32.120
for several bucks a pop on the Wii, and did not have souped up graphics at all, it was

21:32.120 --> 21:35.260
just the same graphics from the original Super Nintendo version.

21:35.260 --> 21:39.980
So it's pretty cool that they released all that in one package, and it has a transition

21:39.980 --> 21:44.400
episode that's completely brand new that transitions between the two games.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.480
So all of it is new, very cool.

21:49.480 --> 21:55.200
It's beautiful looking, I love that it's still 2D, like I don't hate the 3D one on the DS,

21:55.200 --> 21:59.520
I mean it was great and I'm glad they did that, but it's nice to kind of play it still

21:59.520 --> 22:03.440
the old school way, just with all the souped up graphics, like I wish this is what we could

22:03.440 --> 22:08.160
get more of on like Arcade or Virtual Console for fuck's sake, like this would be a great

22:08.160 --> 22:09.840
thing for them to have released.

22:09.840 --> 22:16.080
But it works great on the PSP, looks beautiful, different transition graphics for the battles,

22:16.080 --> 22:20.960
the battles look great, the magic's all been redone so it looks very high def and everything.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.960
It's great, I'm really enjoying it, it's a great value for a Final Fantasy fan.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.320
You know if you're not into the older Final Fantasy games, you don't really have the same

22:28.320 --> 22:31.260
appreciation for them, I don't know if there will be a lot here for you.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.880
I have a bad feeling it's not going to sell very well because I think it just came out

22:33.880 --> 22:35.760
at a real crap time.

22:35.760 --> 22:39.880
Hopefully it will sell a bit in catalog sales, I really want to see 5 and 6 get the same

22:39.880 --> 22:43.760
retreatment, especially 6, it will be very nice.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.120
So hopefully they'll sell a lot of 4.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.180
And that's the other game I've been playing.

22:48.180 --> 22:53.120
So that's really been about it, oh no, one other game I played, this is very important

22:53.120 --> 22:59.080
because I promised last week on the show I would finally try it and I did, I played Minecraft.

22:59.080 --> 23:04.240
And I gotta say Minecraft, the website is not, I'm going to just be honest, this is

23:04.240 --> 23:07.440
my true reaction, a lot of people are going to think I'm an idiot and that's fine, but

23:07.440 --> 23:08.440
I'll own up to it.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.840
I did not find the Minecraft site to be very user friendly because it took me a minute

23:11.840 --> 23:16.240
to kind of figure out there's like an old version that's free or there's an old multiplayer

23:16.240 --> 23:20.000
or there's a new one that you can pay for and a new multiplayer, there's so many different

23:20.000 --> 23:23.960
modes and the website's kind of dated looking and whatever.

23:23.960 --> 23:29.960
So I finally found my way into the game and I played it and I don't get it, I don't get

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
the big deal.

23:30.960 --> 23:35.720
Sorry guys, I don't understand why people are hailing Minecraft, it's like oh my god!

23:35.720 --> 23:39.720
Maybe it's more fun with more people or whatever, but I found it to be about as thrilling as

23:39.720 --> 23:43.640
the program from Lego that lets you build your own Lego structures and then you can

23:43.640 --> 23:47.280
order the bricks and actually build them.

23:47.280 --> 23:52.200
Don't get me wrong, that's kind of awesome too, but I did not think Minecraft was like

23:52.200 --> 23:54.400
OMG!

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
I agree with you.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.400
Did you play it too?

23:56.400 --> 23:59.000
I've played Minecraft, I didn't care for it.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
And that made me kind of sick.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.200
Well, yeah, I mean, but you've got the whole first person shooter thing going on that you

24:04.200 --> 24:06.160
don't usually do well with those.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.720
But I just, I didn't get it.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.040
I don't think it's put together very well either, I think it's not presented very well.

24:12.040 --> 24:16.120
I guess it's one of those like hipster things that like if you're into it you're hip because

24:16.120 --> 24:24.920
it's like hard to get in there and play and all that and build these things, whatever.

24:24.920 --> 24:29.520
For some reason I was reminded of a really old game on the Super Nintendo called Populous

24:29.520 --> 24:32.920
where you could kind of build, and this is also on, I want to say like Amiga, I think

24:32.920 --> 24:37.640
it was originally an Amiga game, and obviously I had a PC port at some point too, and you

24:37.640 --> 24:43.480
like raised and lowered land to keep your people safe and you kind of like played god

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
so to speak.

24:44.480 --> 24:49.760
I don't know why, but with the whole like building blocks and then taking them away,

24:49.760 --> 24:51.360
I felt very populist to me.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.360
And I got to admit like all these people are like hailing it, it's this great thing.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.820
I feel like I've played something like it before, I didn't feel that innovative to me.

24:58.820 --> 25:03.000
So sorry, I guess that makes me not cool, I'm not hip.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
It's okay Rob, we forgive you.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Anyhow.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
I don't think it's cool either.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.260
Moving on, other housekeeping, you can always join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange

25:12.260 --> 25:13.800
Lounge Radio.

25:13.800 --> 25:18.120
Also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, just the abbreviation there.

25:18.120 --> 25:23.120
If you want to follow us there, and of course check us out on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.080
No shows we're taking off in the foreseeable future.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.760
We do have our ninth anniversary show coming up at the end of June, but that's still a

25:29.760 --> 25:34.040
good six weeks away, so we'll give you more details on that as we get closer.

25:34.040 --> 25:39.080
For now, let's get into gaming news, or as I should say, you have to remember what OLR

25:39.080 --> 25:40.080
is all about.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.640
We don't, it's very, very, very, very rare we ever break news on this show.

25:44.640 --> 25:49.760
A lot of times, you know, we like to be friends, sitting around the table, talking smack about

25:49.760 --> 25:50.760
games.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.400
So sometimes it's about putting the news out there on the table to discuss.

25:53.400 --> 25:57.880
So I don't think this is going to be news to anyone, but we need to put it out there

25:57.880 --> 25:58.880
on the table.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.720
So Loki, please, let's address the pink elephant in the room.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.560
Whoa, whoa, wait a second, PlayStation network's been down?

26:04.560 --> 26:07.480
Yes, it's been down.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.760
I don't know if you've actually bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 or Mortal Kombat, which

26:11.760 --> 26:16.440
were huge, huge releases on PS3 the week you were out, and now you can't play either of

26:16.440 --> 26:17.440
them online.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.440
Yeah.

26:18.440 --> 26:25.400
I've never used PlayStation network, but yeah, it's been down for a while.

26:25.400 --> 26:33.080
And you know, they even, they even went and had a press conference yesterday, ooh, press

26:33.080 --> 26:35.520
conference, making everything official.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.920
You know, hey, don't fear, everything's going to be okay.

26:38.920 --> 26:44.240
But yeah, apparently they're going to be returning some services to the PlayStation network this

26:44.240 --> 26:48.000
week, full services within this month.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.800
And I just need to interrupt and say something, because this is really important, Loki.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.800
Part of, you know, kind of the thing that, you know, with the hack and everything is

26:55.800 --> 27:01.800
that credit card data was exposed, or at least they say possibly could have been compromised,

27:01.800 --> 27:04.640
which hadn't come out at the time of last week's show.

27:04.640 --> 27:10.000
And I just want to say, I called it, and I really hate being right sometimes.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.720
That's the second time this year I've been right on some major news.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.720
The other one we'll get to in a little bit, because I've not had a chance to gloat with

27:15.720 --> 27:20.440
Loki here on the show, but I'll get my fair share in just after we cover this story.

27:20.440 --> 27:26.960
All right, yeah, so the list of services that are returning to the PlayStation network this

27:26.960 --> 27:33.840
week are the restoration of online gameplay across the PlayStation 3 and PSP systems,

27:33.840 --> 27:38.360
licenses, including titles that require online verification and download games, access to

27:38.360 --> 27:43.720
music unlimited power by curiosity, which I might add, curiosity is a terrible name

27:43.720 --> 27:52.480
for a service, so thanks, Sony, for coming up with a new word that begins with Q.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.840
Access to account management and password reset, well, that's important, considering

27:55.840 --> 27:58.240
that, you know, our account's been breached and we need to change their passwords.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.240
Well, you're not going to have a choice.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.800
They're going to make you change your password when you come back on, that's a big, big part

28:02.800 --> 28:03.800
of it.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.320
Not only that, you have to do it from the original PS3.

28:07.320 --> 28:11.760
Or an email thing, because, you know, some people have changed their PlayStation 3s.

28:11.760 --> 28:20.880
PlayStation Home, oh goody, Friends List and chat functionality are coming back.

28:20.880 --> 28:21.880
So yeah.

28:21.880 --> 28:28.840
And then some other fun stuff, of course, they're also going to be, as their Welcome

28:28.840 --> 28:38.200
Back program, they're going to be offering some free stuff for you, because they're sorry.

28:38.200 --> 28:43.480
So the free stuff that they're going to be offering, a free download with, I believe

28:43.480 --> 28:49.160
they were saying that was worth $20, maybe?

28:49.160 --> 28:56.820
And then 30 days free of PlayStation Plus, I'm rolling my eyes.

28:56.820 --> 29:04.400
And Curiosity, I guess a free membership to Curiosity or something like that.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.760
Yes, 30 days of Curiosity.

29:07.760 --> 29:12.340
Yeah, I like how those last two bits, oh yeah, we're just going to give you a trial to those

29:12.340 --> 29:17.480
so that maybe you might buy them after, you know, the trial's up.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.480
And a download.

29:18.480 --> 29:23.240
You know, even though all your personal information's been stolen, one download should make you

29:23.240 --> 29:24.880
forget all about that, right?

29:24.880 --> 29:25.880
Eh?

29:25.880 --> 29:26.880
No?

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
Maybe?

29:27.880 --> 29:32.920
They didn't really say, yeah, the download price.

29:32.920 --> 29:39.200
Kazurai was saying that, I guess, a few thousand yen worth of free downloads, so like $20 or

29:39.200 --> 29:40.800
$25.

29:40.800 --> 29:45.440
And yeah, that's interesting.

29:45.440 --> 29:50.440
And then, of course, there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 firmware company with the

29:50.440 --> 29:54.320
relaunch of the PlayStation Network, and they're saying that the network is physically being

29:54.320 --> 29:58.520
rebuilt, because apparently it was just inferior as it was.

29:58.520 --> 30:04.320
You know, it might help that if they didn't store these same, on the same servers, your

30:04.320 --> 30:09.720
credit card information and all that stuff with these servers that actually sell product,

30:09.720 --> 30:14.120
you know, they might want to keep that stuff separate in case one gets hacked, or the store

30:14.120 --> 30:16.880
gets hacked, which is more likely.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.360
So they're going to be doing that.

30:19.360 --> 30:25.380
And they said, and of course, you know, I love it, to make them sound like they're really

30:25.380 --> 30:26.380
on top of it.

30:26.380 --> 30:29.960
Well, it's something we were planning on doing anyway, so we're just going to do it quicker

30:29.960 --> 30:31.800
now.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.080
We were on top of this.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.080
Great.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.080
I'm glad you were on top of it, so you knew that this was going to be a problem.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.720
You just admitted to that.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.960
And then, of course, you know, this is a real big deal, since, you know, about, they're

30:42.960 --> 30:48.520
saying 70 million users worth of data have been leaked out, including credit card information.

30:48.520 --> 30:58.520
So of course, Congress and Homeland Security are now forming task forces or, you know,

30:58.520 --> 31:00.460
sending inquiries about what's going on.

31:00.460 --> 31:05.120
So I guess Homeland Security and the FBI are going to be helping them out, you know, investigating

31:05.120 --> 31:09.480
the data breach and all that stuff.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.260
So I guess that's supposed to make us feel good.

31:12.260 --> 31:13.260
So great.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.240
Our tax money's going to this.

31:15.240 --> 31:21.680
Well, I mean, it is only, like, I think the most major breach that's ever happened on

31:21.680 --> 31:26.440
the internet type of thing, but, um, can I go off now?

31:26.440 --> 31:28.520
Well, hold on.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.720
There was a rumor that they were seeing it, um, the PlayStation, it was hacked through

31:32.720 --> 31:37.880
a PlayStation 3, basically, you know, getting access to the store through custom firmware

31:37.880 --> 31:41.160
or something like that, or some development side or something.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.160
I don't know.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.160
What if they staged this whole thing?

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
No.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.960
The whole thing is, well, here's what it was, and it was really terrible, because all they

31:47.960 --> 31:51.700
were doing the entire time was their, oh, those hackers, those hackers got in.

31:51.700 --> 31:57.280
Yet there was never, oh, well, we're stupid, and we, you know, we didn't, you know, first

31:57.280 --> 31:59.680
off, we didn't encrypt any of our personal data.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
Haha!

32:00.680 --> 32:01.680
Haha!

32:01.680 --> 32:02.680
That's funny, you know?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.000
We'll laugh about that later on.

32:04.000 --> 32:10.020
And then second, you know, their servers were the same servers for, you know, all that stuff.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.020
It's ridiculous.

32:11.020 --> 32:12.020
Okay.

32:12.020 --> 32:19.800
Um, I'm not going to be a satisfied PlayStation because I, you, you can throw all this free

32:19.800 --> 32:24.320
shit at me, although I don't think, honestly, and this is one of the pro Sony things I'm

32:24.320 --> 32:28.440
going to say, because I, I don't consider myself a Sony fanboy or an Xbox fanboy or

32:28.440 --> 32:29.440
any of it.

32:29.440 --> 32:35.800
I, I, I chew out everyone equally, because I love gaming, and these companies screw things

32:35.800 --> 32:37.680
up and it's usually at a management level.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.040
It makes me angry.

32:39.040 --> 32:44.720
Um, and what makes me, the, the free stuff here, I don't think actually Sony really owes

32:44.720 --> 32:47.400
you anything for free, because the network was free in the first place.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.760
And, you know, if your credit card gets hacked, you don't ask the bank for free money.

32:51.760 --> 32:57.120
I mean, you have a protection with your bank that the bank will, you know, look, if you

32:57.120 --> 32:59.320
have a fraudulent charge, you're protected against that.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.780
If you have any type of decent credit card or bank, you're protected against fraud and

33:02.780 --> 33:03.780
all that stuff.

33:03.780 --> 33:08.660
But there's still some onus on you to monitor your statements and monitor everything that's

33:08.660 --> 33:09.660
going on.

33:09.660 --> 33:12.400
But I think what they're really, it's not even necessarily, people think that they're

33:12.400 --> 33:14.840
owed something for the network being down for a few days.

33:14.840 --> 33:18.960
I think they're saying that they're owed something for the hassle of having to go through and

33:18.960 --> 33:22.360
change all that information, get new credit cards and that kind of stuff.

33:22.360 --> 33:27.060
Well, and yeah, I, I can understand that, but at the same time, if you weren't monitoring

33:27.060 --> 33:32.560
your stuff before, you're an idiot, like, sorry, but this should have been a severe

33:32.560 --> 33:36.640
wake up call to you if you haven't been monitoring your stuff before, because you could get your

33:36.640 --> 33:39.860
stuff stolen from a gas pump from one of those readers.

33:39.860 --> 33:43.200
You could get your stuff stolen from any clerk or any waiter at a restaurant that you give

33:43.200 --> 33:44.200
your cards to.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.920
You know, your card number gets out there exposed all the time.

33:46.920 --> 33:51.120
You have to monitor that stuff and if this didn't serve as a wake up call to you, I don't

33:51.120 --> 33:52.120
know what to tell you.

33:52.120 --> 33:56.240
Well, honestly, the best way around any real risk is use cash.

33:56.240 --> 34:00.520
Well, I suppose there's that too, but I don't want to be, I don't want to be tinfoil hat

34:00.520 --> 34:01.520
either.

34:01.520 --> 34:05.660
You know, my agreement with the bank, I'm fucking paying visa, right?

34:05.660 --> 34:09.160
Because they get, there's either the interest that they're making off the credit card to

34:09.160 --> 34:12.560
begin with, or in the case of debit cards, they take a percentage of the sale and so

34:12.560 --> 34:13.560
forth.

34:13.560 --> 34:18.680
These companies are paid to prevent fraud.

34:18.680 --> 34:23.080
My problem here is I need to hear more about how Sony is going to prevent this from happening

34:23.080 --> 34:24.080
again.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.480
I understand they're hiring a privacy officer, which is fine.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.120
I understand that they're moving their data center, whether it was planned already or

34:31.120 --> 34:34.680
not, whatever, at least they're finally understanding, whoops, we fucked up.

34:34.680 --> 34:38.360
And it's kind of one of those fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.920
Because if they put the damn thing back up and then they just get hacked again, they're

34:42.920 --> 34:48.240
going to be, they're going to be dead as a company, period.

34:48.240 --> 34:53.480
It's just like when Jack in the Box, uh, killed the people with Ecoli, a couple, it was probably

34:53.480 --> 34:55.180
about 15 years ago.

34:55.180 --> 34:59.240
Right after that happened, they were the safest restaurant to eat at because you knew if they

34:59.240 --> 35:02.580
were going to mess up again, they would be out of business, every single one of them.

35:02.580 --> 35:06.320
And they've been able to recover from what was an unfortunate mess now, obviously very

35:06.320 --> 35:10.040
different scenarios because you're talking lives are not at stake in this scenario, what's

35:10.040 --> 35:11.360
going on with Sony.

35:11.360 --> 35:16.460
However, there still is certainly, you know, a big passion, big, big headline news thing

35:16.460 --> 35:18.120
going on here.

35:18.120 --> 35:25.400
So, um, there's some other things to consider though, is that what Sony got is that, uh,

35:25.400 --> 35:29.200
Sony needs to kind of ask themselves, you know, how are we going to prevent the hacking

35:29.200 --> 35:30.880
happening in the future?

35:30.880 --> 35:33.280
I'm not condoning the hacking at all.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.720
And you know, I, cause I see some stuff going on in the chat, but I want to make it clear.

35:36.720 --> 35:42.160
The ultimate problem is not with Sony, it's with the hackers and whoever went into the

35:42.160 --> 35:45.260
system in the first place, they are the problem.

35:45.260 --> 35:49.460
And let's be real, if they try to use that credit card data that was stolen at this,

35:49.460 --> 35:52.240
this point, they're going to have the FBI up their ass.

35:52.240 --> 35:58.020
If you're a hacker that did this, or you're somebody that buys this data from the hackers,

35:58.020 --> 36:02.100
you are an absolute moron who's just begging to go to jail because you're going to have

36:02.100 --> 36:05.060
every state agency so far up your butt.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.160
I mean, let's be real.

36:06.160 --> 36:10.420
So if you do have that data, you really shouldn't use it.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.420
Let's be fair.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.420
Okay.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.380
Now, uh, and so I certainly don't condone that.

36:14.380 --> 36:18.820
That's, you know, hacking to that level where you are stealing information, whatever.

36:18.820 --> 36:23.140
And if they, if they are trying to sell it for a profit, as some folks are saying, it's

36:23.140 --> 36:27.500
up on forums and so forth, but you know, what's real and what's trolling.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.500
We don't know.

36:28.500 --> 36:29.500
You know, where's the line drawn.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.540
So I don't condone the hacking.

36:31.540 --> 36:35.900
However, you can't help but feel like Sony kind of opened themselves up to it a little

36:35.900 --> 36:36.900
bit.

36:36.900 --> 36:37.900
Throwing this out.

36:37.900 --> 36:38.900
Sony did.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.820
Didn't Sony kind of come out in the school yard and kind of wave their hands saying,

36:41.820 --> 36:43.280
come at us.

36:43.280 --> 36:47.660
How many times do they get up there on the stage at E3 and say, our system is unhackable.

36:47.660 --> 36:49.300
Wait, wait, wait.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.300
Just throwing this out there.

36:50.300 --> 36:56.140
And I'm not sure on the accuracy of the rumor, but let's just pretend that it's real here

36:56.140 --> 37:02.820
because it would fall in line with the lack of dedication to safety, I guess, or of our

37:02.820 --> 37:03.820
information.

37:03.820 --> 37:10.700
Apparently, the rumor is that that credit card list was encrypted with the same keys

37:10.700 --> 37:14.100
that they use for the PlayStation 3.

37:14.100 --> 37:16.700
Oops.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.460
So the point is, and what I really want to get at here, and this is how Sony can really

37:20.460 --> 37:27.140
earn back my trust, stop being so fucking hard headed.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.380
It is time to admit your vulnerability.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.140
And this press conference yesterday didn't cut it.

37:33.140 --> 37:36.620
It didn't cut it because essentially they came out there and they just, you know, they're

37:36.620 --> 37:41.380
trying to point fingers at everybody else except themselves.

37:41.380 --> 37:44.740
And honestly, what really needs to happen is management needs to be shaken up.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.100
Kazurai needs to come down.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.380
Sorry.

37:48.380 --> 37:52.300
That's what is really going to make me happy is for PlayStation to change their management.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.300
However, unfortunately, I don't see that happening.

37:54.300 --> 37:58.380
Well, what's I think also going to restore a lot of faith that customers might have in

37:58.380 --> 38:01.820
them is for them to display that level of accountability.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.780
Accountability for me, especially as a big thing with a company.

38:04.780 --> 38:09.940
And if I'm seeing none of that, then I'm not going to give them my business.

38:09.940 --> 38:13.620
I mean, that's why I pretty much decided I don't think I'm going to get anything else

38:13.620 --> 38:14.620
for PS3.

38:14.620 --> 38:18.140
At the end of the day, I think Sony can win me back.

38:18.140 --> 38:21.900
I mean, it's not like corporations don't do dumb things once in a while.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.220
And excuse me, Xbox fanboys, excuse me.

38:25.220 --> 38:31.020
The Red Ring of Death thing was atrocious and was horrible on Microsoft's part.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.100
But they've come a long way since then, to be fair.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.100
And they handled it well.

38:34.100 --> 38:37.700
They finally did extend their warranty and they admitted their problem.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.620
That's what I need Sony to do here.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.620
Yeah.

38:40.620 --> 38:47.460
But I don't, until they have some accountability, I don't think I'm going to give them my business.

38:47.460 --> 38:51.620
I mean, but it's a hard situation because, you know, I can see how some of you are thinking,

38:51.620 --> 38:54.420
well, Rob, is that saying what the hackers did is okay?

38:54.420 --> 38:56.500
No, that's not what I'm saying.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.860
What the hackers did is not okay.

38:58.860 --> 39:01.100
But you know what I've said on the show before, hackers going to hack.

39:01.100 --> 39:06.380
And you know, this news we've seen, this stuff about Sony and so forth, they really have

39:06.380 --> 39:07.400
just been inviting it.

39:07.400 --> 39:12.980
This whole thing about, we want to subpoena everybody's PlayStation 3 that ever accessed

39:12.980 --> 39:16.780
a website even remotely related to this GeoHots thing.

39:16.780 --> 39:20.700
When he admitted he wasn't even after coming after data in the first place, he just wanted

39:20.700 --> 39:22.980
to get the other OS thing back or whatever.

39:22.980 --> 39:23.980
I mean, let's be real.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.500
This all traces back to Sony taking off the other OS feature.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.500
Yeah.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.660
If Sony had never done that, this would have never happened.

39:30.660 --> 39:31.660
Yeah.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.860
But hindsight, you know.

39:33.860 --> 39:34.860
Right.

39:34.860 --> 39:37.780
But maybe it needed to happen.

39:37.780 --> 39:42.580
Maybe we were all getting a little too comfortable with this whole digital distribution thing.

39:42.580 --> 39:46.940
Maybe this, you know, and I've said this before on the show and I still mean it.

39:46.940 --> 39:50.260
This is going to set digital distribution back a little bit because this goes beyond

39:50.260 --> 39:51.260
Sony.

39:51.260 --> 39:56.660
This is going to affect that horrific copyright protection thing that Capcom has.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.960
If you bought a game like Bionic Commander or whatever, you haven't been able to play

39:59.960 --> 40:02.740
it for the past 11 days on PlayStation 3.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.380
And we're having class action lawsuits against only Sony.

40:05.380 --> 40:06.380
I'm sorry.

40:06.380 --> 40:07.380
Someone needs to file one against Capcom.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.380
Yeah.

40:08.380 --> 40:09.380
Sorry.

40:09.380 --> 40:10.740
I can't play a game I bought.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.940
That's your problem, that's kind of your problem.

40:12.940 --> 40:16.340
You know, that's what I like to see happen.

40:16.340 --> 40:18.340
No, I agree.

40:18.340 --> 40:20.580
Alright, I'm going to chatroom.

40:20.580 --> 40:21.580
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

40:21.580 --> 40:25.460
Derek H. in our chatroom says, I would like a press release saying they've hired a hit

40:25.460 --> 40:27.820
team to track down and assassinate the hackers.

40:27.820 --> 40:30.220
You know, it's interesting, I did feel like at that press conference day they were really

40:30.220 --> 40:32.580
trying to finger point at Anonymous.

40:32.580 --> 40:33.940
They don't even know who did it.

40:33.940 --> 40:37.260
And I know they keep saying, well, it could be Anonymous, but you know, they said they

40:37.260 --> 40:40.780
didn't do it, but you know, there's no head to Anonymous, so it could have been another

40:40.780 --> 40:41.980
cell of Anonymous.

40:41.980 --> 40:46.140
Yeah, but the whole thing was, I think, is people used Anonymous because there was that

40:46.140 --> 40:47.940
whole conflict going.

40:47.940 --> 40:52.080
So whoever it was that was planning on doing this probably said, oh, now seems like a good

40:52.080 --> 40:54.180
time because they're going to be looking at them.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.460
Or be distracted by them.

40:55.460 --> 40:57.940
And so that's when they went and did it.

40:57.940 --> 41:04.620
And if it was actually what they, the rumor is, where that it was part of this Rebug firmware

41:04.620 --> 41:10.940
that was out there that gave you basically developer access that you could actually download

41:10.940 --> 41:12.300
content for free and stuff.

41:12.300 --> 41:17.020
That was one of the rumors I heard that they, one of the reasons that they took the store

41:17.020 --> 41:25.100
down because someone found a way to basically steal PlayStation Network stuff.

41:25.100 --> 41:29.900
But then again, you know, I don't know, they're not really being forthcoming with everything

41:29.900 --> 41:30.900
that happened.

41:30.900 --> 41:36.060
Even during their press conference, they're like, well, we can't confirm that anybody's

41:36.060 --> 41:40.540
actually touched the credit card data that was even compromised.

41:40.540 --> 41:45.220
So you know, they're kind of going back on saying, oh, well, you know, the credit card

41:45.220 --> 41:48.580
stuff's not compromised, but here's all this stuff that you need to do to make sure that

41:48.580 --> 41:49.700
your credit card's okay.

41:49.700 --> 41:53.500
You know, it's like, oh, well, that doesn't sound very sure of yourself now.

41:53.500 --> 41:56.220
That's a CYA move.

41:56.220 --> 42:00.660
Rama says, and also I guarantee that a few people may have lost their jobs over this.

42:00.660 --> 42:03.220
You know, and it's always unfortunate for job loss.

42:03.220 --> 42:07.500
I just hope the right people lost their jobs over this because if it was the people down

42:07.500 --> 42:10.880
in the trenches, that's not who needs to be losing their jobs over it.

42:10.880 --> 42:14.580
And you know, I don't want to just go off speculation either.

42:14.580 --> 42:19.940
If Sony shook up their management, I want to see the receipts.

42:19.940 --> 42:23.180
Going to the chat room with some more comments here.

42:23.180 --> 42:27.460
Rama says, Sky, yes, Microsoft got a black eye for the red ring of death, but Microsoft

42:27.460 --> 42:29.540
stepped up to the plates and handled it.

42:29.540 --> 42:32.620
When people bitched at Nintendo about the Wiimotes, they stepped up.

42:32.620 --> 42:35.860
Now that people are bitching to Sony, they turn a blind eye and say, that's not, there's

42:35.860 --> 42:36.860
not a problem.

42:36.860 --> 42:38.020
Jedi mind trick my ass.

42:38.020 --> 42:39.220
Absolutely right.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.780
That's my whole point.

42:40.780 --> 42:43.260
And that I don't think that press conference yesterday cut it.

42:43.260 --> 42:49.020
And I really don't know what is to blame except the management at Sony.

42:49.020 --> 42:53.060
It's being a poorly managed company right now.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.420
That's that.

42:54.420 --> 43:02.180
Let's see, also, some other folks in chat, Defective Candy saying, gah, it wasn't Anon.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.540
Bangs her head against the desk.

43:03.540 --> 43:08.940
Well, I mean, the only problem Anon has is that because it is the way it is, and I'm

43:08.940 --> 43:14.620
not knocking Anon, like, you know, whatever, it's just a subculture of the internet.

43:14.620 --> 43:19.360
But the problem with Anon is because it has no face, it's really easy to point the finger

43:19.360 --> 43:20.360
at them.

43:20.360 --> 43:24.540
It's really easy for Kasarai to get up there and say, well, Anon was in our systems and

43:24.540 --> 43:28.820
Anon did this hacking and, you know, we're sending the FBI and the top people on this.

43:28.820 --> 43:31.420
We're going to make an example out of some of those Anon kids.

43:31.420 --> 43:33.220
Very easy to blame them.

43:33.220 --> 43:35.620
Well, good luck.

43:35.620 --> 43:39.020
You know, they have yet to find any of these people anyways.

43:39.020 --> 43:41.700
And you know, how are they going to prove who did it?

43:41.700 --> 43:42.700
I mean, that's tough.

43:42.700 --> 43:44.500
That's the best thing about it.

43:44.500 --> 43:48.540
That's the smartest thing any type of vigilante group can do on top of that is to be completely

43:48.540 --> 43:49.540
decentralized.

43:49.540 --> 43:53.540
You know, not know who the other parties are.

43:53.540 --> 43:57.020
Dungeon Buster in Artarum says, I don't think that's necessarily related to anything about

43:57.020 --> 43:58.340
GeoHots or Anonymous.

43:58.340 --> 44:02.140
Sony has a lot of other enemies.

44:02.140 --> 44:06.780
Perhaps everything else that was going on with the other companies showed the real person

44:06.780 --> 44:09.620
who hacked all this how easy it was to do.

44:09.620 --> 44:14.260
Maybe, I still think though, a lot of what happened leading up to this helped whoever

44:14.260 --> 44:15.300
did it.

44:15.300 --> 44:18.520
We've got an email coming up that's got a pretty interesting suggestion.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.660
So I'm going to...

44:20.660 --> 44:21.660
Alright.

44:21.660 --> 44:26.660
Here's my suggestion though, is all this free stuff you're throwing my way, like free download

44:26.660 --> 44:33.580
and free PlayStation Plus and free Curiosity, I don't care about two thirds of that.

44:33.580 --> 44:35.940
And the download, I might not even care about that either.

44:35.940 --> 44:44.300
So I mean, that's like saying, imagine if you will, Rob, that you went to a restaurant,

44:44.300 --> 44:48.180
nice restaurant or whatever, or not even necessarily a nice restaurant.

44:48.180 --> 44:53.620
Say you went to Jack in the Box, we'll use Jack in the Box again, and you went there

44:53.620 --> 45:02.620
and you bought something and someone stole your credit card information, stole your identity,

45:02.620 --> 45:07.140
and you found out, you went to the management and they're like, here's a voucher for a free

45:07.140 --> 45:12.220
jumbo jack, sorry.

45:12.220 --> 45:15.920
Would that cut it with you?

45:15.920 --> 45:20.780
I would be kind of like, really?

45:20.780 --> 45:23.820
This is what you're giving me?

45:23.820 --> 45:29.060
Here's the thing though, I'm not fully convinced that only Sony is vulnerable to a hack like

45:29.060 --> 45:30.060
this.

45:30.060 --> 45:35.100
And we've heard of other personal data being compromised on other websites and so forth.

45:35.100 --> 45:42.540
So I'm not sure I fully believe that my information is 100% secure with Microsoft, with one of

45:42.540 --> 45:46.260
their only services, Steam, with Blizzard.

45:46.260 --> 45:49.100
I don't know, but I'm not going to freak out about it.

45:49.100 --> 45:52.380
I'm not going to panic and I'm not going to cancel all my credit cards and all that stuff

45:52.380 --> 45:59.260
because the money I pay to have a debit or credit card in the first place is supposed

45:59.260 --> 46:02.580
to pay to protect me from the fraud.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.300
So I'm not that worried about it.

46:05.300 --> 46:09.000
And I can thank the PlayStation for being so useless to me that the last time I used

46:09.000 --> 46:13.500
my credit card, it had expired that same month, so hahaha!

46:13.500 --> 46:16.660
You have old credit card information, good luck spending that money.

46:16.660 --> 46:20.140
Dan was saying right before the show though, the one time he finally decided to buy something

46:20.140 --> 46:23.620
on PlayStation Network, that was when Moondiver came out, because it's done by the dude that

46:23.620 --> 46:26.720
did Strider.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.420
Then all this goes down and he's like, well shit.

46:29.420 --> 46:34.180
But I mean, other than that, we never really used PlayStation Network, I had zero interest

46:34.180 --> 46:35.180
in it.

46:35.180 --> 46:39.060
I didn't make a profile until we had our system for two years.

46:39.060 --> 46:42.980
If that's any indication, when I was playing Final Fantasy 13.

46:42.980 --> 46:45.780
Let me go back to this too in our chatroom, because this is a good point and it came up

46:45.780 --> 46:48.860
on my Twitter earlier, but it hasn't come up yet on the show here tonight.

46:48.860 --> 46:52.360
Tiger Kong in our chatroom says, you don't have to worry about Nintendo getting hacked,

46:52.360 --> 46:55.740
they don't hold any personal info other than friend codes.

46:55.740 --> 47:01.140
Well now, despite the shit we've given Nintendo over the years about being so fucking far

47:01.140 --> 47:05.100
beyond the times, behind the times when it comes to online stuff, right now, their way

47:05.100 --> 47:08.860
of handling credit card payments looks pretty fucking good.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.860
In light of all this.

47:09.860 --> 47:14.140
I would rather have security than convenience.

47:14.140 --> 47:17.420
Just so you know, the Nintendo Wii makes you put in your complete credit card info every

47:17.420 --> 47:18.420
time.

47:18.420 --> 47:19.420
It doesn't save it.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.140
And sometimes it can get a little frustrating, it's like, here I am, putting it in again

47:22.140 --> 47:23.140
on the Wiimote.

47:23.140 --> 47:27.980
But right now, that system looks pretty darn good.

47:27.980 --> 47:30.380
No it doesn't, because, I'm sorry.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.380
Once again.

47:31.380 --> 47:33.380
Not that I'd actually buy anything on virtual console right now.

47:33.380 --> 47:38.380
I don't care, you know, let's praise Nintendo for being lazy.

47:38.380 --> 47:39.380
I'm sorry.

47:39.380 --> 47:41.220
I'm not saying praise them.

47:41.220 --> 47:46.760
I'm just saying, it's ironic how this all kind of works out where Nintendo has really

47:46.760 --> 47:50.340
nothing to lose with what happened here.

47:50.340 --> 47:52.380
Because of the fact they're so far behind the times.

47:52.380 --> 47:56.020
So my only point is that maybe we were moving ahead too fast.

47:56.020 --> 48:00.220
We weren't moving ahead too fast, it was just they had poor security, that's all.

48:00.220 --> 48:05.020
They thought that, oh, we're big bad Sony, we're just perfect, we're never gonna get

48:05.020 --> 48:06.160
hacked.

48:06.160 --> 48:09.140
And that was the wrong, first off, that's the wrong thing to go touting.

48:09.140 --> 48:13.500
That'd be like saying, hey, good luck trying to break into my house and steal my stuff.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.660
I mean, come on, you're just, you're...

48:16.660 --> 48:18.960
People are motivated by spite.

48:18.960 --> 48:23.260
You know, if you're trying to, people like being competitive.

48:23.260 --> 48:28.100
And people like, you know, challenging things that you're giving them, especially a company.

48:28.100 --> 48:31.740
They like looking at the company as the evil corporate giant.

48:31.740 --> 48:38.100
And if you go and say, well, good luck doing that, rrrr, people are gonna take the David

48:38.100 --> 48:42.740
and Goliath route and they're gonna try to bring Goliath down.

48:42.740 --> 48:47.660
And you know, for every hundred people that try and fail, someone's gonna do it.

48:47.660 --> 48:50.300
So you know how you avoid that?

48:50.300 --> 48:55.340
You don't go saying, try to hack me.

48:55.340 --> 48:59.020
Being in the chat room at chat.orangehonestrader.com, there's lots of interesting stuff going on

48:59.020 --> 49:00.140
in the chat room right now.

49:00.140 --> 49:03.980
Let's see, Spaznator in our chat room says, I really didn't expect any freebies.

49:03.980 --> 49:07.680
All I'd like is an I'm sorry and assurance that they're learning from their mistakes.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.680
Thank you.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.620
That would be great, actually.

49:10.620 --> 49:14.660
Derek H in our chat says, Sky, that's like saying a horse and carriage looks good after

49:14.660 --> 49:16.300
you get into a car accident.

49:16.300 --> 49:21.460
You know, it's really funny that you use that as an example because my mom has a true diagnosed

49:21.460 --> 49:24.820
fear of driving cars and vehicles and all that.

49:24.820 --> 49:28.420
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that, you know, she just didn't like them, whatever,

49:28.420 --> 49:29.780
growing up or what have you.

49:29.780 --> 49:33.360
And the one time she decided to buck her fear and get behind the wheel of the car after

49:33.360 --> 49:36.460
going through the process, getting a license, all that stuff, you know, she finally decides

49:36.460 --> 49:39.140
to drive on the freeway for the first time in 20 years.

49:39.140 --> 49:40.140
She got sideswiped by a truck.

49:40.140 --> 49:42.420
It wasn't even her fault, by the way.

49:42.420 --> 49:43.420
It was somebody else.

49:43.420 --> 49:48.280
And so now she refuses to drive on the freeway ever and she will only drive the car herself.

49:48.280 --> 49:51.820
Like if it's like a do or die scenario.

49:51.820 --> 49:55.820
So actually, horse and carriage rides can be very romantic.

49:55.820 --> 49:58.580
Well, I actually will say this.

49:58.580 --> 50:04.340
I do prefer Nintendo's method of not storing the information because whenever I pay, the

50:04.340 --> 50:10.900
only I think online thing ever that has my information saved is my PayPal, which I used

50:10.900 --> 50:16.180
to pay for any online service now because I can stop my information from PayPal and

50:16.180 --> 50:22.540
the site won't have my information or my WoW subscription.

50:22.540 --> 50:25.820
But other than that, nowhere else has my information.

50:25.820 --> 50:29.040
Black Wolf in our chat room says, you know, the Battlestar Galactica wasn't affected by

50:29.040 --> 50:33.380
the Cylon attack because it didn't use as much future technology as the other Battlestars.

50:33.380 --> 50:34.380
Excellent point, Bobby.

50:34.380 --> 50:37.900
At least somebody who's on the same wavelength as me.

50:37.900 --> 50:39.220
All right.

50:39.220 --> 50:42.680
I, yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.060
You know, that hasn't already been said.

50:44.060 --> 50:48.780
I just, where's the, I'm sorry.

50:48.780 --> 50:50.380
We'll see what happens.

50:50.380 --> 50:51.380
Moving on.

50:51.380 --> 50:55.620
I do have another story that's kind of in the same vein as a lot of this stuff, if you

50:55.620 --> 50:56.820
will.

50:56.820 --> 50:58.980
And what did I say was the root cause of all of this?

50:58.980 --> 51:03.220
Sony removing the other OAS feature in the past.

51:03.220 --> 51:07.960
And interesting enough, Sony's troubles may not be over as far as that's concerned.

51:07.960 --> 51:11.860
They've actually lost what could be a landmark decision in this whole thing.

51:11.860 --> 51:12.940
Now here's the deal.

51:12.940 --> 51:18.780
It's not as major as it might seem, but it happened in Finland.

51:18.780 --> 51:21.100
And it happened by what's called a consumer's board.

51:21.100 --> 51:23.620
It is a ruling, but it's a consumer's board.

51:23.620 --> 51:29.240
It's not necessarily a government legitimate courtroom ruling, but the consumer's board

51:29.240 --> 51:34.860
in Finland has decided that this man who actually took Sony to court, oh, they were removing

51:34.860 --> 51:40.260
the other OAS feature, that Sony needs to cough up a hundred euros for doing it.

51:40.260 --> 51:45.100
That he should get that because he lost the Linux ability after updating to play a newer

51:45.100 --> 51:47.060
game that he bought for the system.

51:47.060 --> 51:49.220
Here's a quote from the original article, which is floating around.

51:49.220 --> 51:50.980
I'm looking at this off a web forum, so I apologize.

51:50.980 --> 51:53.040
I don't know where this came from originally.

51:53.040 --> 51:56.420
The man at the center of the case in Finland, which was brought to the consumer complaints

51:56.420 --> 52:00.820
board, lost the ability to use an alternative operating system after an update was installed

52:00.820 --> 52:01.900
from a new game.

52:01.900 --> 52:06.180
He was seeking 150 euros in damages for the removal of the other OAS feature.

52:06.180 --> 52:10.980
The CCB said that the removal of other OAS crippled console features that were present

52:10.980 --> 52:14.940
at the time of purchase and agreed that consumers should be compensated.

52:14.940 --> 52:18.880
It recommended that the manufacturer and seller of the console pay a hundred euros jointly

52:18.880 --> 52:20.520
to compensate the man.

52:20.520 --> 52:25.280
The CCB does not have the power to enforce the ruling, but the opinion of this board

52:25.280 --> 52:31.460
in Finland is considered by the courts in a dispute, meaning if it does go to court,

52:31.460 --> 52:34.560
this will weigh heavily on what happens.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.820
So, interesting.

52:37.820 --> 52:43.180
I guess if Sony truly thought their system, I mean, well this also kind of goes back to

52:43.180 --> 52:44.780
Sony being hard-headed.

52:44.780 --> 52:47.900
Sony put the other OAS feature in there because they were convinced it could not be used to

52:47.900 --> 52:49.380
hack their system because it was unhackable.

52:49.380 --> 52:52.980
The minute they found it, oh, it was hackable, oh, they removed it.

52:52.980 --> 52:57.020
Well, maybe you shouldn't have put it there in the first place!

52:57.020 --> 53:00.900
And still though, it's like saying, you know, oh, well this feature, no one's really using

53:00.900 --> 53:02.220
this feature.

53:02.220 --> 53:05.820
Okay, it's a feature on something and you remove it.

53:05.820 --> 53:09.260
People are going to be pissed because it is, somebody is obviously using it.

53:09.260 --> 53:13.060
If no one was using it, why'd you put it there in the first place?

53:13.060 --> 53:15.900
I mean, that's like saying, oh, Spanish language?

53:15.900 --> 53:17.860
No one uses a Spanish language.

53:17.860 --> 53:22.860
I can just speak English or French.

53:22.860 --> 53:23.860
So there you go.

53:23.860 --> 53:25.540
It'll be interesting to see what develops of that.

53:25.540 --> 53:27.500
Sony's troubles may not be over.

53:27.500 --> 53:30.940
We're going to be talking about the legal team moving from whatever was going on with

53:30.940 --> 53:35.700
Geohotz to now having to deal with class action lawsuits over the downtime.

53:35.700 --> 53:41.540
This whole other OS lawsuit and there's a whole other nightmare of problems.

53:41.540 --> 53:44.100
I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing in the background right now.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.100
That's all I hear.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.100
Yeah.

53:46.100 --> 53:48.740
Anyhow, Dark Soccer, don't you have something, just something to take my mind off.

53:48.740 --> 53:49.980
How about some good news?

53:49.980 --> 53:50.980
How about it?

53:50.980 --> 53:53.380
How about something for Portal 2?

53:53.380 --> 53:56.660
There's going to be a new download content this summer.

53:56.660 --> 54:01.580
Valve put out an announcement and it's free, which is great.

54:01.580 --> 54:07.260
It'll be called DLC number one and it will have new test chambers, leaderboards, challenge

54:07.260 --> 54:11.420
mode for single and multiplayer, quote and more, end quote.

54:11.420 --> 54:18.660
It will be on all platforms, Mac, PC, Xbox 360, and maybe PlayStation three, maybe?

54:18.660 --> 54:22.940
And uh, it'll be on, yeah, it'll be on PS3.

54:22.940 --> 54:26.500
I'm just making a poke, but hey, that's pretty cool.

54:26.500 --> 54:30.420
And I so much love the game already that it'd be kind of neat to have some new stuff to

54:30.420 --> 54:31.420
do.

54:31.420 --> 54:36.620
You gotta admit though, every developer, every single one of them who makes money off DLC,

54:36.620 --> 54:41.140
who makes money off designing games specifically for the Xbox live arcade and PlayStation network

54:41.140 --> 54:45.820
platforms has got to be looking at what's going on right now, 11 days of lost sales.

54:45.820 --> 54:46.820
This is free.

54:46.820 --> 54:50.620
I know this is free, but I just, it just reminds me of that whole thing and that's why I'm

54:50.620 --> 54:54.340
saying the impact on the whole digital distribution thing will be felt.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.900
Anyhow, I like free things though.

54:56.900 --> 55:00.900
I hope part, I hope we do get more maps and things that let this game live on.

55:00.900 --> 55:01.900
It'd be great.

55:01.900 --> 55:05.540
And I think it's a good value as it is, but just if they enhance that value, especially

55:05.540 --> 55:08.860
if they have like a map editor for people, Oh my gosh.

55:08.860 --> 55:12.060
I think that's one of the things I was hearing about going to be coming out actually is that

55:12.060 --> 55:16.260
they're because that was always been kind of cool though.

55:16.260 --> 55:18.220
Like, you know what Gary's mod is, right?

55:18.220 --> 55:22.400
You know, the modding community is really big out there and they've, you know, paid,

55:22.400 --> 55:24.580
you know, to put some development into some of this.

55:24.580 --> 55:28.500
So they're seeing people doing the same thing with portal and are encouraging it.

55:28.500 --> 55:32.620
And I think they're supposed to have, I remembered hearing something about them having some sort

55:32.620 --> 55:36.100
of level sharing coming out.

55:36.100 --> 55:37.980
There was some fan wank discussion last night.

55:37.980 --> 55:41.360
I want to say it was one when I was on wow about talking about how awesome it would be

55:41.360 --> 55:44.100
if like there was a Tron themed portal level or something like that.

55:44.100 --> 55:47.680
And I'm like, that fan wank could be a reality if they do release some of these like map

55:47.680 --> 55:49.300
editors and things, somebody will be on that.

55:49.300 --> 55:50.300
You know it.

55:50.300 --> 55:53.900
It's ironic, but the orange and blue would fit very well with the Tron universe.

55:53.900 --> 55:54.900
Wouldn't it?

55:54.900 --> 56:00.500
So yeah, and considering, yeah, actually it would.

56:00.500 --> 56:05.980
Can you imagine like a death match portal type thing or like four player portal or something

56:05.980 --> 56:08.660
that we just death match portal?

56:08.660 --> 56:09.660
I don't know.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.780
I, I don't know.

56:11.780 --> 56:16.300
There's I, there's part of me that wants to say no, they should think about the more competitive

56:16.300 --> 56:20.160
stuff when portal three comes out and there's a part of me that says actually portal three

56:20.160 --> 56:22.080
should probably never come out.

56:22.080 --> 56:25.460
I don't think there should be a portal three.

56:25.460 --> 56:30.300
You know, maybe it's like one of those movies that really doesn't need a sequel.

56:30.300 --> 56:35.580
I don't see at all possible how there could be a portal three where there's money to be

56:35.580 --> 56:36.580
made.

56:36.580 --> 56:41.540
There's always, they're saying though that for, um, half life three that what's your

56:41.540 --> 56:43.740
face tell is supposed to be in half life three.

56:43.740 --> 56:44.740
Yeah.

56:44.740 --> 56:49.220
Speaking of like valve and things that end in three, I'm not so sure that's a possibility

56:49.220 --> 56:51.740
with house actually.

56:51.740 --> 56:59.460
Have they ever gotten to three in their series three episode three is supposed to be episode

56:59.460 --> 57:00.460
three is a myth.

57:00.460 --> 57:01.460
Okay.

57:01.460 --> 57:02.460
Yeah.

57:02.460 --> 57:03.460
Let's see.

57:03.460 --> 57:04.460
Left for dead.

57:04.460 --> 57:05.460
Well, the first two came out real quick.

57:05.460 --> 57:06.460
Then there was never a third one portal.

57:06.460 --> 57:07.460
Well, we'll see.

57:07.460 --> 57:08.940
And yeah, no, I don't know.

57:08.940 --> 57:11.420
Did they ever get to three?

57:11.420 --> 57:12.940
I'm not saying this necessarily a bad thing.

57:12.940 --> 57:16.100
I'm just, you know, well, let's put it this way.

57:16.100 --> 57:20.380
We haven't heard of any new games from valve yet and I can imagine that there's a certain

57:20.380 --> 57:22.500
E3 convention around the corner.

57:22.500 --> 57:28.980
So I'm sure with, you know, nothing really on the slate from valve, there's lots to possibly

57:28.980 --> 57:29.980
announce.

57:29.980 --> 57:30.980
Yeah.

57:30.980 --> 57:34.580
This could finally be where they do drop the bombshell about half life episode three, but

57:34.580 --> 57:35.580
I don't know.

57:35.580 --> 57:38.700
Or left for dead threes with a portal gun in there.

57:38.700 --> 57:40.220
Or maybe something new.

57:40.220 --> 57:43.340
I mean, I kind of trust valve with new ideas right now.

57:43.340 --> 57:45.280
You know, they've had a lot of good stuff.

57:45.280 --> 57:49.540
Like left for dead, great game, often copied portal.

57:49.540 --> 57:50.540
Excellent little thing.

57:50.540 --> 57:53.380
I mean, I'm, I'm all for whatever they come out with next.

57:53.380 --> 57:56.940
I believe one of the things they have on the horizon is their whole, uh, defense of the

57:56.940 --> 57:57.940
ancients.

57:57.940 --> 57:58.940
Dota.

57:58.940 --> 57:59.940
He's called Dota two.

57:59.940 --> 58:00.940
Yeah.

58:00.940 --> 58:06.660
They have an official Dota thing coming out, which was originally a Warcraft three mod,

58:06.660 --> 58:08.260
but they hired the people that made it.

58:08.260 --> 58:10.100
It's not the same thing as league of legends.

58:10.100 --> 58:13.540
In fact, legal legends is kind of, it's this whole, the defense of the ancients thing has

58:13.540 --> 58:17.080
gone a million different ways because blizzard has their own thing coming to starcraft legal

58:17.080 --> 58:20.220
legends is out there too, by, I believe some of the people that were involved with Dota

58:20.220 --> 58:21.220
in the beginning.

58:21.220 --> 58:25.420
And then the people that got hired from valve for Dota have the official Dota two game

58:25.420 --> 58:26.420
coming out.

58:26.420 --> 58:28.260
And I think that's probably what you're going to see.

58:28.260 --> 58:33.860
Most of it E3 this year out of valve, anyhow, free stuff.

58:33.860 --> 58:34.860
Yeah.

58:34.860 --> 58:35.860
Free stuff is good.

58:35.860 --> 58:39.660
And I'm all for continuing to expand the terrific game that is portal two, but I would honestly

58:39.660 --> 58:42.700
be still be happy with my purchase if they never expanded it.

58:42.700 --> 58:44.740
But I think I'm still having fun.

58:44.740 --> 58:45.740
Oh yeah, absolutely.

58:45.740 --> 58:48.180
I just think it's a great value.

58:48.180 --> 58:51.540
Anyhow, Loki, let's move on.

58:51.540 --> 58:53.100
Ah, yes.

58:53.100 --> 58:59.700
And the, the other big story that was floating around the web of course is the off rumored

58:59.700 --> 59:03.220
a sequel console for the, we obviously, I mean, there's going to be a new console from

59:03.220 --> 59:04.820
Nintendo at some point.

59:04.820 --> 59:10.180
Um, now Nintendo has officially announced that yes, they will be talking about a successor

59:10.180 --> 59:16.460
to the Wii, not necessarily a Wii two, but a, another console coming, um, for 2012.

59:16.460 --> 59:22.220
And of course, um, you know, they're saying, uh, you know, it's going to be shown off at

59:22.220 --> 59:23.220
E3.

59:23.220 --> 59:28.580
It's going to be playable E3, um, probably if you're pressing behind doors, but you know,

59:28.580 --> 59:29.900
it will be playable.

59:29.900 --> 59:30.900
It'll be there.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.660
Thing that has the Uber long line to play.

59:32.660 --> 59:33.660
Yes.

59:33.660 --> 59:39.900
That's been Nintendo's E3 motif for years, uh, minus the airport, of course, tons of

59:39.900 --> 59:44.060
rumors about what it is and project cafe and all that fun stuff.

59:44.060 --> 59:47.700
And just so you know, last week we talked at length about this cause a lot of the rumors

59:47.700 --> 59:48.700
had come out.

59:48.700 --> 59:52.620
Now we have the confirmation Nintendo saying, okay, yes, it's happening and we'll see you

59:52.620 --> 59:53.620
at E3.

59:53.620 --> 59:55.420
That's, that's the news from this week.

59:55.420 --> 59:58.260
Last week we talked at length about a lot of stuff, just so you know, which by the way

59:58.260 --> 01:00:05.220
would include when I in January on this program said, Nintendo is showing a new console at

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.060
E3 this year because they've got nothing going for them on the Wii right now, but that new

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:13.820
Zelda game and you, Loki, said, no, no, they're not going to show, no, the Wii still prints

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.820
money.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.300
They're not going to show a new console at E3.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.900
So I just wanted to say, thank you.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.900
Okay.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.780
Um, but you're still wrong with them not having anything coming out on the Wii.

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.420
What's going to come out on the Wii?

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.420
Let's see.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.100
They've already got two games that they have coming out in June.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:35.900
Wii Play Motion and Mystery Case Files, which was previously Dust Dust.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.540
And then they also have their Zelda game coming out, which yes, I can probably see them doing

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.660
another Twilight Princess, oh, it's meant for the Wii, but we're going to port it over

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.100
to the new system because, uh, well actually, you know what, I don't know if they would

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.020
do that because if it's coming out at the end of 2012, then I don't think that they

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020
would delay it that long.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020
They need something for Christmas this year.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:59.360
If the system isn't coming out until 2012, uh, you know, and to be fair, I had speculated

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.020
like why are they waiting until 2012?

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.040
But I guess they did the same thing with the 3DS.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.300
They do need something this year.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:11.260
And I actually think you calling the new Super Mario Brothers sequel, I think is a distinct

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:15.220
possibility for the rabbit out of their hat for the Wii this year.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.860
Let's, yeah, I know you guys talked about this last week, but I wasn't here, so I'm

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.140
just going to get my take on a lot of stuff.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.940
And you love Nintendo more than anyone on this show, so definitely want to know your

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.940
opinion.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:29.500
Listen, okay, we've got to think like Nintendo here and why they're doing what they're doing.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.220
Here's how it's going to all work, I think.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.860
Okay, let's take the name Project Cafe.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.860
What is a cafe?

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.700
A cafe is a place that you go gather with your friends.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:45.020
It's a very casual meeting place, lots of, you know, chatting and interactivity and that

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.020
kind of stuff.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:51.820
So maybe now the focus is going to be, and you know, that'd be great if they actually

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:58.140
did more like online kind of think of like Facebook stuff, you know, where you're sharing

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:01.620
stuff with your friends, you're, you know, conversing.

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:08.420
It's very casual, I don't know, lots of online content, we'd hope.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:14.180
Sorry, I have to say S2100 Matt in the chatroom says, Rob, the Christmas hot seller is the

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.500
Vitality sensor.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.220
I guarantee you the Vitality sensor is dead, it's been swept under the rug.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:26.540
However, you may see it rear its little ugly head on whatever, like, you know, just a little

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.660
piece of metal on the back of some controller.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.820
Nintendo will never fully scrap an idea.

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.780
It will rear its ugly head again at some point, but as far as the Wii Vitality sensor, no.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.300
It got laughed out of submission.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:44.820
Alright, so anyways, so you may see something like that, but this is Nintendo we're talking

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.980
about here, so I don't know if they're actually going to do that.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:53.460
I would hope that, you know, now being that this is the next generation of consoles, they

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:59.100
would understand that yes, okay, online gaming is something that people do want, you know,

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:05.820
social, you know, community features, something that people do like having, because Facebook

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.780
is popular, all this stuff's popular, let's bring it in, okay, so let's assume that they're

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780
going to do that.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.620
Oh God, that's why the controllers are all touch screens, because they're going to want

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.780
you to take them out in public, just like the 3DS, they're going to want you to take

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:22.460
those things with you wherever you go, so that when you meet people, you can, like,

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.900
do the game data trades, just like the 3DS.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.540
No, I don't think they're going to be doing that.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.540
Really?

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.900
And here's, here's, okay, first off, they're not going to have a controller like, well,

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:37.940
they're going to have, they may have a controller with a six, I have a hard time believing that

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.540
there's going to be a six-inch touch screen on a controller, because that's going to be

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.980
fucking expensive.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.620
Just so you know the kind of level where I speculated last week, I said if it's true,

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:49.180
if it's even true, because, you know, all the people kind of come out of the woodwork

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.620
about, you know, these speculations and so forth, if it's true, you know, at one point

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.220
the Wii was supposed to project 3D imagery on the wall, remember that, but here's the

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:00.860
thing, if it's true about these touch screens, I think it's like a, like the printers, like,

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.340
you know how there's a lot of $300 printers out there where you can take the screen off

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.620
and, like, digitally manipulate your photos on the screen and then print them from that,

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.620
and they're kind of like a low-quality screen, but they are full-color and they look alright?

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.540
I think it's that, but, like, a fucking iPad is a controller?

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.540
No.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.260
No, it's, it's not anything like that.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:21.700
If anything, I would see maybe it's some sort, because you have to also understand, Nintendo's

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.280
not going to compete with themselves.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.140
Why would they release something that could be used as, like, a portable gaming device

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.980
when they have a portable gaming device that doesn't make any sense?

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.300
If anything, they'd want you to use your 3DS or something like that for some sort of connectivity,

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.820
but whatever, okay?

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.300
And then the other thing, too, is the cost of this thing, I mean, if this controller's

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.580
like $100, people are like, fuck that, I ain't buying a $100 controller.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.580
I think the 3DS will stand in as a controller.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.020
I think that's how they don't bite themselves in the foot.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.380
It's a controller that will also do the 3D display.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:55.100
Okay, so let's just assume, okay, let's say that, I mean, don't get me wrong, they could

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.900
come up with some really low quality screen that could, I mean, look at the PlayStation

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.580
1 low monitors that were $50 or whatever, I mean, you put a touchscreen display on top

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:07.380
of there, a touch panel display, you could, you know, kind of jerry-rig something like

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.380
that.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:15.900
So, anyways, so let's say they, that's going to happen, that'd be interesting, I guess,

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:20.220
but they're also saying that they're still going to keep the original controls as well,

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:25.500
because, like I'm expecting, this system's probably just going to upscale these old Wii

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.500
games.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.700
So you know how you see all this emulator footage with 1080p, new Super Mario Bros.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.900
and stuff like that, and how it looks really pretty?

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.940
There you go!

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.900
Your games are brand new again, and we can still sell Wii games, you know.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.460
I think they're even going to take one of two approaches.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.620
They're either going to try to get everybody to go up onto this new platform, or they're

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.940
going to try to keep this platform along with the Wii.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.820
You know, you have the Wii for the casual people that don't want to spend a lot of money

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.460
on stuff, and then you have this new system for the hardcore players that really want,

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.700
you know, something that has the graphics and all that.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.700
But guess what, though?

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.620
If you have those Wii games that you want to buy, they look really pretty on your new

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.020
HD platform or something like that.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:10.340
But all I gotta say is- I think you are on the money on this.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.340
I really do.

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.940
I hate saying when you're, I think when you talk about this, and yeah, and it's funny

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:19.620
because somebody in chat, who said this in chat, said, Amiga777 in chat said, please

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:25.460
no illusions, the dolphin GameCube had next to nothing to do with water.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:29.740
But I honestly think, like, what's the one place where everybody always razzes Nintendo

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.900
online?

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.880
What does Nintendo want a piece of?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.880
What everybody's into.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.460
That's what the Wii was all about, was trying to get everybody into gaming.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:42.880
Don't think they don't look at Facebook and say, hmm, how could we get a part of this?

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:48.340
I just hope- This is the Facebook- But I just really hope that they don't try to do some

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.500
stupid gimmick with this touchscreen thing, because honestly I don't need another fucking

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500
gimmick from Nintendo.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.940
I mean, let's just stop- Nintendo is a fucking lazy company.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.940
I'm sorry.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.020
They are a fucking lazy company, and you know why?

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:06.240
Because they will take the least amount of effort to put out a new game.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:11.260
I mean, they're porting old shit for the 3DS, okay great, you're updating stuff.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.960
Why don't you create a damn new game?

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.020
You can do it in the same style as the old game.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.940
You know, you did the same thing with, like, you know, the Wind Waker looking stuff on,

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:24.180
you know, the DS, or I guess Wind Waker, yeah.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:30.060
So you did it, like, on the DS, but, you know, why can't you just create new games that look

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.060
like the old games?

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.540
Why do you have to port the old games over?

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:38.060
It's because you don't want- You want to spend the least amount of time possible working

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.160
on this shit, because people will buy it no matter what you put out.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.780
So what's the least possible effort that they can put in a new console?

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.980
Oh, I don't know!

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.280
Something that takes the old games and makes them look new.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.960
That's what you're gonna do.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.820
And then they can put out new games that look even nicer if they want, but at the same time,

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.860
they don't have to do that much because they can just put out these low-quality games and

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.380
they upscale everything and it looks pretty.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:02.140
Yeah, but I don't think- But I don't- This is not gonna be Wii 2.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.320
It's absolutely not gonna just be the Wii with enhanced graphics.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320
Absolutely not.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.320
I mean, there's a whole little follow-up-

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.300
But if it was, they should call it the Wii Wii.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.580
There's a follow-up article to this where they actually said they came out and said-

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.580
What is this?

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:17.680
Satoru Iwata comes out and says, quote, we would like to propose a new approach to home

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.180
video game consoles.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.180
Please.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.180
Okay.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.380
A new approach to home video game consoles.

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.460
So with the Wii- Is the Facebook thing.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.460
Yes.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:31.180
So with the Wii- But not actual Facebook, Nintendo book.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:35.740
With the Wii, they were trying to get people that were getting non-game players to play

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:36.900
this console.

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:41.340
So were they gonna try to- It's kinda hard though, because now, what are they gonna try

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:48.660
to bring- Oh my god, this would be- This would be hilarious, because it'd be basically eating

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:49.660
their own words.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.140
Wouldn't it be funny if they just like came out with something that's very similar to

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.940
like the iOS marketplace or something like that, really cheap-ass games, and this whole

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.220
like iPad type thing?

01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.220
DSiWare?

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:03.500
Well, no, I understand that they have DSiWare, but you know, I'm saying to the point where

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.340
it's, you know, more than three releases a week or something like that.

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:10.140
You know, just something ridiculous and very casual games.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.620
I'd laugh my ass off because, you know- Oh, Apple, they're stupid, you know.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.300
Oh, then we're gonna copy them!

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.340
I don't know.

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:22.980
I can't really pass judgment on it yet until we actually see what it is, but I, you know-

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.460
Let me put it this way.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.620
If it's anything like the other Nintendo promises and stuff that we've seen, a lot of it is

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:30.620
really eye roll-worthy.

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.000
I mean, seriously, remember the Wii Zapper?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.500
I mean, I go back to the Wii Zapper, you know, when they first showed it off, the prototype,

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.500
it looked fucking badass.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:43.300
It was like, oh yeah, dude, that's the Zapper right there, and then when they came out with

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:48.260
this plastic shell Zapper that looked like shit, it was like, what?

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.260
Really?

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.900
That's your controller?

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:56.840
And speaking of which, when did we- are we ever gonna get any other controllers that

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.580
plug into the bottom of the goddamn Wii remote?

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.000
Because we have the nudge- No, you're not.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.180
Because they're on a new console now, so the answer is no, Loki.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.180
You're not.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.180
I can answer that for you.

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.180
All these promises.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.180
You're welcome.

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.500
Just never following through.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:14.260
Let me ask you this, because obviously you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics, it's why

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.100
people love you or hate you.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.300
But yet you own a 3DS and you've owned multiple 3DSs.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.620
Yeah, but I don't play it, and I don't even know why I own it.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.820
I'm not razzing you on it.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:30.340
My true question for you is, what could Nintendo do at E3 with this console to make you go,

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:33.380
okay, Nintendo, I misjudged you.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.140
You're on the right track again.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.560
Get with the times.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.700
That's what I'm saying.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.700
That's what they need to do.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.660
They need to take themselves seriously, because if they try to pull out another system that's

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:47.380
just another gimmick, you know, another gimmicky system, and I'm sorry, the 3DS is kind of

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.380
a gimmicky system.

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:53.500
I bought into the gimmick, because all it is is a fucking DS with 3D gameplay, a little

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.500
bit better graphics.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.500
But that's it.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.500
I mean, they're not really, I mean, whoopty shit.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.760
It has tilt controls on it.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:06.740
I don't want tilt controls, but whatever, you know, that's part of it.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:12.940
But I mean, if they're just, if, I need something a little bit more than just, oh look, new

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940
Mario game.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.100
Oh look, another Mario Kart.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.460
Oh look, another Zelda game.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.020
Maybe make a new franchise.

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:24.260
You know, you've been dealing with these old franchises for a long ass time.

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:30.420
How about creating the next good franchise, or maybe just, I don't know, putting a little

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.580
bit more effort into something, because if we put out another Zelda game, you know, or

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.980
if they take Twilight Princess and like make it look even prettier or something like that,

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.740
or like that one Zelda game that they were showing off that was Twilight Princess at

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.820
one point, and then they ended up, you know, scrapping that kind of look for the game because

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.820
it's a dark, you know, Zelda game or something.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.820
I don't know.

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:55.860
Maybe a little bit more than just Nintendo games and better graphics.

01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.740
I mean, I don't know.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.860
I would just, I want to see what they're offering.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.900
That's really, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:10.100
But I'm sorry, I know for a fact that I'm going to be laughing my ass off during this

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.100
press conference.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:17.740
You know, it's just going to be, because they have these really wacky ideas of what people

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:22.420
want, but apparently it works for them, so you know, I'm not going to fault them for

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:27.780
it, but you know, at the same time, there's consoles out there that I'm playing way more

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780
than Wii.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.860
Although, to be fair, my wife has gotten back to playing the Wii.

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:35.860
I did break my Wii for a little bit, though, and I had to fix it by swapping out the motherboard,

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:40.860
but you know, and then we got back into playing some of the old Wii games that we liked, like

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:46.340
Excite Truck, which Nintendo, for the love of God, just make another damn Excite Truck

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:51.540
game, do not make Excite Bots, just another Excite Truck game with more tracks.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.540
That'd make me happy.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.980
How about a new F-Zero?

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.740
That's what I asked for on last week's show.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740
Eh, whatever.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.020
Uh, play Speed Racer.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.020
It's pretty much F-Zero.

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:04.980
Um, no but seriously, they just need to do that.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.220
Just make, yeah, perfect example right there.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.220
Excite Truck.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:14.420
Launch Wii title, use some of the features of the Wii that like, you know, like, oh SD

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.420
memory cards.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.660
You can play your own music off the SD memory card.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:18.740
That's really awesome.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.580
It made that game so much more awesome, because you can listen to your music while you're

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.100
driving in this really awesome racing game.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.100
Sequel comes out.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.100
What do they do?

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100
Oh, guess what?

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.580
We need more mini games in there.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.700
Mini games do not belong in a fucking racing game.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:36.440
Oh, and then we take out the whole, you know, music playing feature, because no one really

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.020
used that.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.220
Thanks, Nintendo Sony.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:45.820
Um, and then also they just add a couple extra tracks, but seriously, throwing a pie at a

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:48.220
clown's face should never be in a racing game.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.700
Bullying should never be in a racing game.

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.340
Throwing darts should never be in a racing game.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.420
Making a sandwich should never be in a racing game.

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.420
Ever.

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:02.420
I get that it's wacky and stuff, but it's not fucking Excite Truck.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.740
So that's what Nintendo needs to do to make you happy is stop making sandwiches.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.300
They need to treat us like adults instead of just little, little kids.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.300
Get it.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.300
People.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.300
Yeah, I get it.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.220
People like the party games on the Wii, because, you know, Wii is kind of a social game, but

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:18.260
you don't need to make every goddamn game a party game, and you also don't need to make

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.580
every damn game a family game.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.500
What about this comment from Forbes 1-1-1 in our chat, Loki?

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.140
Again, they don't care about what you want.

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.140
It's about the money.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:27.140
I retorted.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.380
If they want the money, they need to care about what we want.

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.740
Well, how well did Excite Truck sell?

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.740
Not very well.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.660
Maybe that's why they didn't give you more of that.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.180
Because they didn't advertise damn game.

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:43.260
It was an awesome game, and it's really underrated, and I'm really sad that they...

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.260
But here's the thing.

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.500
Yeah, you're right.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.340
You don't have to do what I want, but I don't have to buy your console either.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:51.340
And you know what?

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:55.740
As consoles get more expensive, and money gets tighter, I won't be buying every console

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.140
that you put out.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.620
And yeah, the 3DS was pretty much an impulse buy, and you know what?

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:05.160
Kind of have some buyer's remorse over it, because there weren't any...

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.140
There weren't any really must-have games at launch, and you know what?

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.500
There aren't really any must-have games in the next portion of the year.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.260
And yeah, I know Zelda's coming out.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:17.140
But as I've said before, Ocarina of Time is the most overrated fucking game on the Nintendo

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.140
system ever.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.140
Agreed.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.140
So you know what?

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:24.620
I'm not buying Ocarina of Time, so what's that leave me with?

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.620
Fucking nothing!

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:26.620
Because there's nothing coming out!

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.620
So...

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.620
Kid Icarus.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.620
Yeah, Kid Icarus.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.620
Oh, great!

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.800
Well, then I'll enjoy my three games for the next nine months, or whatever it's gonna take

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.020
for Kid Icarus to come out.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.020
So that's it.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.260
You know, we'll see what they...

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.180
Netflix 3DS, that's what I'm looking forward to.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:43.900
We'll see what they bring to the table, you know, at E3.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:47.420
But just remember this, you know, and another thing.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.060
Here's the other thing that'll make me happy, Nintendo.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.780
When you release your console, and you're talking about the features that are gonna

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:58.060
be on your console, they better not be coming in an update that's five months, three months,

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.540
one month, one day after the console's release.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.180
It better be at fucking launch.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.100
It's like a stupid 3DS.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.260
Oh, it has a web browser!

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.660
Oh, a feature coming later.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.660
Sorry.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:11.640
All right, let me move on to something else.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.020
Let's talk about something very serious here.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.780
I want to talk about Beyonce for a minute.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.780
That's serious.

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.820
This is very serious.

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:24.940
Beyonce is being sued because, God, we love lawsuits this week.

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.620
That's what we seem to be reporting on.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:30.140
Beyonce got sued for $100 million!

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.260
She probably has it.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.620
Beyonce, even though her new single is terrible, just saying.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:38.540
But Beyonce has been sued for $100 million from Gate 5.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540
Why is she being sued?

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:45.260
Well, it's because the singer made this huge demand for more money during a crucial moment

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:49.660
in the production of a game called Star Power Beyonce.

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.660
That's right.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.180
They were making a game called Star Power Beyonce.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.940
I have no idea what this game would have been.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.420
I imagine it must be like the Michael Jackson experience or something.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.420
I don't know.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.420
She stars out of her cooch.

01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:03.380
A music game that involves Beyonce, where you could do the single ladies dance in the

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.820
privacy of your own home.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.260
Put your hands up.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:13.140
Anyhow, Gate 5 says, we are entitled to the $6.7 million that we invested and the $100

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.040
million in profits that we would have made.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:22.660
They had to let 70 employees go right at the Christmas season because of what Beyonce did.

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.140
What a Grinch.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:30.980
And they want an injunction against Beyonce from commercially associating with any other

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:37.060
video game or using confidential information that she got when she was working with the

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:39.060
company.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:43.420
Isn't it ironic that she was in a commercial for the DS as well, I think, mid last year.

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.920
It was the year before.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:49.360
Like she's actually going to retain any confidential information gained from a video game company.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
Like she remembered anything.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360
That information was like poof.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.860
It just evaporated out of her head.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:53.860
Oh, yeah.

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:54.860
That was real cool.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:55.860
You guys looks real cool.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.860
But how much you pay me?

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:59.620
Seriously, she picked up nothing.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.900
Yeah.

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.020
Maybe her people did.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.020
Her entourage.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.020
I don't know.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.020
Yeah.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.220
I think Jay-Z sat with her in those meetings.

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:07.220
I'm sorry.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.380
We now have a discussion going about people buying Beyonce cootch stars.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.780
I said I would rather buy Gaga cootch stars.

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.060
I wouldn't buy.

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.660
How about all cootch stars?

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.460
Just get all the crazy ladies.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.940
A Beyonce game sounds dumb.

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.940
I'm sorry.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.940
It would have made money.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:26.020
It wouldn't be like the biggest video game ever, but it would have made money.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:31.020
A hundred million dollars, I mean, that's way more than if they were going to spend

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.980
a hundred million dollars or they spent a hundred million dollars in this game.

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.140
No, they think a hundred million is what they lost.

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.140
They lost.

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.140
Oh, come on.

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.140
They would have never.

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.140
They would have never made a hundred million dollars on this game.

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:43.940
That would require them selling.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.060
Let's just say it's a fifty dollar retail game.

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.680
And let's just say that it's all pure profit.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.900
I mean, because this is never going to.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.580
I mean, it would be way more than that.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.300
They would have to sell more than two million copies of this game to make their money back,

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.100
assuming that they were getting all of the money from the actual game sale, which they're

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.100
not.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.200
So, you know, they're saying that this game would have sold over two million copies.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.900
It would have not sold over two million copies.

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:12.600
It would have sold two hundred thousand copies at the most.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.580
So they would have had to fire people anyway.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.580
So who cares?

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:24.940
Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news, and then we're going to get to

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.180
the release dates here in a little bit.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:32.180
Trying to keep the show moving right along with what was a pretty hefty news week.

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.680
And I know there's going to be lots of phone calls tonight, so I want to keep some time

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.680
open in Part B.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.680
So it's my turn?

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.680
That's right.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.680
It's your turn.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.680
Tron!

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.540
But you have to do the single ladies dance.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.540
No.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.540
Alright.

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.540
Tron.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:46.940
Guess what about Tron?

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.940
Pinball!

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.660
Ooh, happy, happy, happy, happy.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:56.300
Yeah, I showed this to Dan, and he's like, what pinball tables can we get rid of to get

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.300
this?

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:58.300
I was actually thinking that.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.460
I was like, which pinball tables are you going to sell to buy the Tron pinball?

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:06.100
Well, actually, three of our tables would equal the cost of this, which is the problem.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.100
It's going to be expensive.

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.100
You know what?

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.100
I think you should do it.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.220
If it were my choice, I'd get rid of Lord of the Rings, but Dan loves that table.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.220
So, anyway.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:18.700
Now, Stern, which is like the only company doing tables anymore, is putting out Tron.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:22.260
And instead of doing just their usual teaser of the cabinet art, they've actually got the

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:30.580
whole play field out, which I'm going to go ahead and link an image in the chat room for

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:31.580
them to look at.

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.540
But the pictures are up at arcadeheroes.com.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.740
It's actually looking really good.

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:42.900
It's got 3D models in there, the light cycles, little figures in the back.

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:43.900
Plenty of ramps.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.400
Plenty of lights.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:53.260
And they're actually talking about doing a potentially limited edition where they might

01:20:53.260 --> 01:21:00.260
have something other than just those monochrome LED backgrounds.

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:04.860
But that's still kind of speculation.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.860
It's pretty cool.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:09.860
But the back glass is supposed to have the 3D parallax effect that's the same on the

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:11.460
Avatar pinball.

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:16.620
So it's going to be out sometime this month with a limited edition in June.

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.020
And it looks sick.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.700
And hopefully California Extreme will have one for us to play.

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:24.260
They had Iron Man last year.

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:28.860
And on top of that, one of the other tables that Stern's doing, by the way, is the Rolling

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.860
Stones.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:30.860
But it's like a $6,000 table.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:31.940
So how much is that table?

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:32.940
This one's going to be about $4,000.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.940
$4,500.

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:34.940
Something like that.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940
That's not bad.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.940
Jeez.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:37.940
Well, you know, Stern printed it.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:42.700
This is the problem I have with this is that now that we don't have Williams and Midway

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.780
doing tables anymore and Capcom is out of the game, Stern's really the only company

01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:48.780
there is.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.740
They can charge what they want.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:58.060
They have the Williams collection coming out on the 3DS in June, I think.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.060
That's kind of cool.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.060
I've got the Williams tables, I will.

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:05.900
Yeah, that game has been re-released so many damn times by Crave.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:10.380
I thought Crave closed down, but yeah, they're still making games.

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.380
Porting games.

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.380
I don't know.

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:20.100
Oh, I, you know, and this is my thing, as much as I love video pinball, nothing compares

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.480
to the real thing.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.980
So I would almost always go out and hunt down a good pinball table than have...

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:30.180
So you wouldn't be interested in like a pin maim table?

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.260
Like an actual, you know...

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.260
I played a pin maim.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.780
And you know what?

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.500
It was fun, but not my thing.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:41.940
It was, I mean, and I'll tell you what I did because a few years ago they had one at California

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:45.860
Extreme and right next to it was Black Knight 2000.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.860
And I played Black Knight 2000 on the pin maim and then I played Black Knight 2000 on

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.620
the real thing and it's just...

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:56.580
You just can't get the same feel.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.260
It's a very good simulacrum.

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:05.060
I mean, pin maim itself is very well done, but it's just not the same.

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.060
I want to go ahead.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:09.540
I don't, I can't remember very often in the history of our show that we do this, but there

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.580
is a real world that goes on out there outside of us and not just what's happening in the

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.580
world of video games.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:19.180
And if you are all about 100% video games, I do encourage you to go outside once in a

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.180
while.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:21.900
But needless to say, there's a lot going on in the real world right now.

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:26.820
They are saying that President Obama is scheduled to address the nation any minute now.

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:31.020
I guess it's supposed to happen at 1030 Eastern, but it's running a little late.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:33.260
I take this with a grain of salt.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:34.260
We'll find out in the next few minutes.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.380
I'm looking at what is usually a pretty respectable source.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:42.300
It does sound like Osama bin Laden is dead and the US has the body and that's what Obama

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.380
is expected to announce the next few minutes.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.380
I hope.

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.340
That is not confirmed.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:51.340
I'm getting that from a source that's usually pretty right on about these things.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340
So more to develop.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:55.000
So I do encourage you, if you are listening to the show, you might just want to keep CNN

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.280
open in another tab and furiously hit refresh on that because if that is the news, that's

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:04.340
obviously going to have people talking about more than just games for quite some time.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:12.460
And then he invites in the guy from, the announcer from NBA Jam, Boom Shakalaka.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:16.900
Did you, by the way, not meaning to really derail so much, but did you see the White

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.420
House correspondent's speech?

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.420
I did.

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.420
That was brilliant.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:21.420
I love that.

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.420
I love that man.

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.420
Good times.

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.260
I love that I voted for him.

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.780
His sense of humor is amazing.

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.780
Um, all right.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:34.420
I, again, I just, I just know where to look for information and rumors that are usually

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.420
right on.

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.420
Hold on.

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.420
Hold on.

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.420
Let me just put a funny, maybe more of an image in your face.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:45.020
Um, wouldn't it be hilarious if they just pulled a whole fucking weekend at Bernie's?

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.020
Oh shit.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.020
Stop it.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:48.020
Here's Osama bin Laden.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.580
He's waving his hand.

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.580
All right.

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:51.580
Moving on.

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.580
Moving on.

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:53.580
Thank you.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.660
Uh, Bobby actually gave me the original tip on that.

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:55.660
So thank you, Bobby.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:59.460
Who told me to go look at CNN and that made me think to go, uh, check, uh, my tweet.

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:00.460
Yeah.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:04.380
It's, it's again, not official, but my guy on Twitter who tends to be on top of this

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:08.700
stuff is rolling out all these sources that seem to point to that's being the case.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.380
Well that, that'd be, uh, interesting.

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.780
That would be extremely interesting to say the least.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.500
Anyway, we, the show must go on as they say, but I do know we live in a multitask world.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.540
So those of you listening live may wish to all tab to CNN, but please don't turn us off.

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.340
Um, we'll, if, if the news is, if they confirm it or whatever it is, I will relay it for

01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.340
you guys.

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.340
Okay.

01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:31.340
How about I keep the website up and I'll keep an eye on it.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:32.340
All right.

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.340
Okay.

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.340
Uh, moving on.

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.700
Let's talk about release dates and what is coming, uh, soon to a gaming, uh, store near

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:38.700
you.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.700
Yes.

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:42.820
These games may not be able to be played by Osama bin Laden very soon, but, um, coming

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:48.300
next week, Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska for the Nintendo Wii, if you like your hunting

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:53.500
and you like your Alaska hunting and you like your Sarah Palin, but she's not in the game,

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.940
um, can't hunt her either.

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.540
So I don't know.

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:58.540
It's budget price.

01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540
I guess that might be good.

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:06.140
Uh, Thor God of Thunder or God of movie tie-in game that is coming out on PlayStation three,

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:12.420
Xbox 360, Wii, uh, DS, and, uh, that's it.

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.420
No 3DS.

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.420
Unfortunately that got delayed.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:20.780
Yeah, you'd think it'd be easy to port over, um, also the game that I've been highly raving

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:26.940
about and I sadly enough haven't been playing much of it lately, just for no reason whatsoever,

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:29.660
but a Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on PlayStation three.

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:35.660
If you like racing games and you like crazy destruction and just all sorts of insane stuff

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:39.360
going on while you're racing, seriously go pick this game up.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.140
It's just amazing.

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:48.980
So that's coming on PlayStation three this week and, um, sadly that is it.

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:53.260
That is all kind of good stuff for the rest of May though, but, uh, just unfortunately

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.100
next week is a little what are some other highlights in May just so I know what I should

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.100
be looking at.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:02.420
Uh, well, uh, in two weeks we have a brink, which is going to be an awesome first person

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.420
shooter from Bethesda that's coming out, uh, Lego pirates.

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:11.420
If you're into that kind of thing, uh, MX versus ATV alive, if you like that, uh, and

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:15.700
then two weeks the game I'm looking forward to LA noir from rockstar games coming out.

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.620
Yes, there's quite a few people looking forward to that.

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.060
So that's going to be awesome.

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:23.500
And then of course, uh, towards the end of the month, uh, if you are a big fan of racing,

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:29.220
uh, dirt three coming out and a hunted the demons forge, um, if you're into those types

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220
of games.

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.140
Um, unfortunately actually a lot of stuff that was supposed to become a month, fear

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:37.460
three, dungeon siege three and red faction all got delayed to June, but red faction looks

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.460
pretty good too.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:43.520
Although it's kind of got a dead space vibe and I don't know, not really feeling dead

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.520
space.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.260
So, but LA noir looks awesome.

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:49.940
So that's probably the next game I'll pick up and maybe brink, brink looks pretty cool

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.940
too.

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:55.020
All right, let's move on to Japan and what is going on with Japanese releases.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.780
Um, this week, uh, Xbox three 60 is looking pretty dry.

01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:01.100
There's not a lot going on the Xbox three 60 I'm, I have a feeling they have a quiet

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.380
week too cause they don't have anything on the PlayStation three as well.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.620
I wonder if they have something huge on the handhelds.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:09.900
Um, nothing on the Wii obviously because there's just nothing happening on the Wii these days

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:11.220
on the Sony PSP.

01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:13.580
Yeah, nothing's happening until May 12th.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.300
I'm not seeing anything.

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.860
There is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week.

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.180
That's it.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.180
That's the releases.

01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:28.580
Uh, May 12th steel diver on the, on the three DS, uh, which we've had here obviously since

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.580
release.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:34.060
Uh, major league baseball on the 12th, but as far as the fifth, which the games are usually

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.060
out on Fridays.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.060
Uh, nothing.

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:37.060
Wow.

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:41.900
It could be, it could be that all that's going on in the world as far as Japan is maybe shuffled

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:42.900
some things up.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:43.900
I mean, it's don't know.

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.900
Possibly.

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:49.740
Well, we have a few releases for the UK on the fourth is Bongio HD missile fury for Xbox

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:55.380
three 60 Bongio is so much fun and there's section eight prejudice for PC and on the

01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:02.020
sixth is sniper ghost warriors, steel diver, and Cabela's dangerous hunts to 2011.

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:08.700
Ooh, that's what I say about that.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.700
All right.

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:10.700
Well, so much for release dates.

01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.780
It's looking a little dry, no matter what part of the world you're in.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.460
Uh, so let's go to Loki.

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:15.460
All right.

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:18.500
Um, well there's some interest.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.420
The chat was yelling at me because I said the release dates are looking pretty dry in

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.420
Japan.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.420
You guys are dummies.

01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.620
All right.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:30.300
I mean that with love, but seriously, all right, Loki, um, Sony revealed two new tablet

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.660
devices that are gonna be part of the PlayStation suite.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:42.260
Um, one of them, uh, I guess they're officially the S one and S two tablets, which great.

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.260
That's nice.

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:49.020
Uh, they're both running Android 3.0 and uh, the S one tablet I guess has, there's any

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.700
like kind of an unconventional design.

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:56.140
It looks like that it's, uh, I don't know, it kind of tapers a little bit.

01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:01.020
So it's like on a slant, but uh, basically 9.4 inch screen.

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:07.740
And then of course the S two tablet, it's a dual screen tablet and you know, people

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.820
are calling it looks saying it looks like the DS.

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:13.980
I guess you can, you know, run two different things at the same time.

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:17.460
You can watch a video and chat, you know, at the same time on the other screen or use

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.940
the other screen as a soft keyboard and you know, whatever.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:27.980
Uh, but there are two 5.5 inch screens and um, both of course will be able to play select

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.540
PlayStation one games.

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:30.540
Tangible buttons.

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:31.540
Nope.

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:32.540
Couldn't care less.

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:33.540
Exactly.

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:38.460
So yeah, I'm not interested unless they were to have tangible buttons cause can you imagine

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.700
playing a PlayStation one game on your iPhone?

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:45.100
Cause that's what this is basically.

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:51.900
I mean seriously, so, all right, uh, anyhow, let's move on to, uh, another story.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.260
This is also kind of a followup cause uh, last week in the middle of the show, uh, some

01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:59.300
details were breaking on, well, I guess it was really that day, fantasy star online two

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:00.300
details.

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.860
Uh, we're getting some more information on what that was all about.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:10.220
So there was a PSP two promotion event that was in Akihabara, uh, over last week.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:17.620
And um, let's see, there was, uh, more information released on fantasy star online to, uh, apparently

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.380
now you're going to be able to jump in the game.

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:26.900
Also randomly generated hunting areas, some third person shooter style game play, uh,

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:27.900
and so on.

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.260
So they're adding jumping into it.

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:33.260
That could, uh, certainly make the levels different randomly generated hunting areas.

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:38.140
See, I seem to remember the levels in the old, uh, fantasy star games were online ones

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:39.940
were kind of randomly generated.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:43.780
It seemed like there were like three different types of levels you could get.

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:47.980
So it'd be kind of neat if it's like a truly random generation thing going on.

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.740
So more information going on out there.

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:54.180
There's even a little video, but it looks like it was taken down.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:55.900
So there you go.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:56.900
All right.

01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.660
So, uh, what's going on over there?

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:04.440
Real, you guys are watching real world and, uh, it was just said national journal learned

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.440
it's true.

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.060
It says, uh, yeah, according to MSNBC, they're saying president Obama make a statement soon

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:13.020
regarding Osama bin Laden, Fox news saying that New York times is saying it.

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.420
So it looks like, uh, there you go.

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.420
All right.

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:20.900
Sweet back to, uh, again, keep CNN open in another tab.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.900
Uh, there you go.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.020
If you're listening to the show or whatever your, I say CNN, but whatever your website

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.020
of choice is.

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.020
Okay.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.020
Kids.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.020
All right.

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.020
BBC news.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.620
Let's get to something extremely important.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.780
This could be almost more important.

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:38.660
It isn't more important, but almost if there was anything that was as important, it would

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:44.020
be this, a trip down memory lane for dark Sakura where every week she decides, Hey,

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.900
you guys should be playing this video game classic game of the week.

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:50.900
Dark Sakura.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:53.540
Tell us about what is the classic game of the week.

01:32:53.540 --> 01:33:00.300
The game of the week is afterburner, which came out in 1987 it's a flight SIM arcade

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.960
game put out by Sega.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.900
It had a motion full motion seats, um, at least for the deluxe cabinet.

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.940
It was also designed by you Suzuki who is the man.

01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:17.580
Um, anyway, you control an F 14 Tomcat and you go through 18 stages and you take off

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:23.260
from an aircraft character called the Sega enterprise, which is a, an homage to top gun

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.700
and not star Trek.

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:32.500
And so the, it had basically of integrated flight stick that would control the way the

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:38.420
cabinet moved either back and forth and it had, you know, hydraulics in it and it would

01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:40.340
have Canada missile buttons.

01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:45.940
It was also a stand, um, a standing upright one, but the rotating cockpit one was the

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.660
awesome one.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:53.360
So, um, it was, I mean, basically it's just straightforward.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:59.060
You shoot down planes and you have like a lock for your missiles and you can shoot them

01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:01.380
down and you choose, you know, your direction.

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:06.060
There's also afterburner two, which was the sequel that was put out the same year.

01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:12.780
And um, then, uh, there were other games that focus on the F 14 Tomcat, like G lock air

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:18.460
battle and strike fighter that was actually rebranded as afterburner three and then sky

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:19.460
target.

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:25.660
There was also Sega strike fighter, which was, uh, a free roaming type of F 14 game.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.300
And then we got afterburner climax, which is the one that I played just this week.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:30.300
That's really sweet.

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:35.580
There's also a PSP, um, release called afterburner black Falcon.

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:40.220
And uh, actually some of the music in this was, uh, remixed for Bayonetta.

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.660
It was pretty cool.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:46.740
As far as other versions that have been out, there was Amiga, the Amstrad, the Atari ST,

01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:52.700
sharp X68000, at them towns, Commodore 64, Nest, Sega master system, PC engine, Sega

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.980
Saturn, PC, MSX, and ZX spectrum.

01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:01.660
And then, um, there was a 32 X version that was called, um, afterburner complete in Japan

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:02.660
in Europe.

01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.100
But I'll tell you what's cool about that.

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:08.340
And also is the same for space Harrier on 32 X is that it's the arcade version, the

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.380
full arcade version.

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:13.820
You can actually do a little trick to make it say insert coin, you know, so it's kind

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.820
of, kind of neat.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.220
It's, it's pretty much the same rom.

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:22.780
And the little article here has a few other, uh, uh, bits and pieces like in Terminator

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:26.140
2 Judgment Day, John Connor's playing afterburner.

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.380
Oh, that's right.

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.380
I forgot about that.

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.380
Yeah, he is.

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:38.100
And in red dwarf seasons two and three, there was an afterburner in the bar area and pretty

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:39.100
cool.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.100
Yeah.

01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.580
I love the music in this game.

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:44.580
I'm really surprised you have never done afterburner before.

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:50.740
Well, in an afterburner, I have to say is not one of my favorite games, but I love afterburner

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:51.740
climb.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:52.740
I love the cabin.

01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:58.800
Well, afterburner climax actually has a full, um, full on hydraulic seats that has front

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.460
backside up down motion.

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:02.980
So it's super, super fun.

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:07.140
And the other thing that was really great about these is that they did include a motion

01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.140
stop.

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.140
So if you couldn't take it, it would just stop the movement.

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.140
It was pretty cool.

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.460
But yeah, afterburner.

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.740
All right.

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:18.140
There it is your classic game of the week.

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:24.060
Liberty afterburner best known in its arcade release, but certainly ported to plenty of

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.060
home consoles.

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.060
All right.

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.700
We're going to take a quick break here, uh, at orange launch radio, but don't go anywhere

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.700
guys.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.500
We're going to be right back with plenty more of the show tonight.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.480
Uh, we've been talking a lot about PlayStation, but there's been big news on Xbox this week

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.480
as well.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.480
So we're gonna talk about that as well.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.340
Uh, some 3DS news as well.

01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:41.300
And Loki is going to bring us some hacking news.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:51.420
All we come back after a quick break with more of orange lounge radio.

01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.740
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

01:36:53.740 --> 01:37:00.020
We are live on this Sunday evening, May the 1st of 2011 with the 411th episode of our

01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.020
show where we're giving you not just the four one one on what's going on with PSN and all

01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.620
that stuff, but apparently what's going on in the real world as well.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:12.380
Uh, it's quite a, uh, exciting evening, but in the interest of those that are, uh, we'll

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.380
keep you abreast of anything huge develops, but in the interest of those that listen to

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:21.980
the podcast throughout the week, by the time this will be long reported to death, uh, yes.

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.180
There's one little announcement that's going to be closer to 1130 central time that the

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:27.180
announcement will be made.

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:31.100
They're still working on final statements, but everything's set up.

01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:36.060
So that will be 9 30 Pacific for our live listeners.

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060
All right.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.060
So let's move on though with the show.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.380
We want to get back into video games, especially out of the interest of those that listen to

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.380
the show throughout the week.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:46.100
By the time this has been long reported on, I'm going to name my first born wolf after

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:47.100
Wolf Blitzer.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.740
Yes, because Wolf was a freaking bad ass.

01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.860
How about what was the name of the dog that played piano on the Muppets?

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.860
Was that Ralph?

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860
Ralph.

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.860
I like that.

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:55.860
No wolf.

01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.860
How about what if you have twins?

01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860
Can you have Wolf and Ralph?

01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:03.540
I'll have Wolf and uh, Wolf and Fox.

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.540
All right.

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.020
Let's move on back into the show.

01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.820
Uh, first spinoff shows.

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.540
If you'd like orange launch radio, there's some other shows you might like as well.

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:14.340
Uh, I do one, it's called the best little hoard house in the Azeroth.

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.140
It's a show about all things world of Warcraft.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140
This week was a fun week.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:18.500
It was our international edition.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:23.660
We had this gal seal from the, uh, girls gone wild podcast and she is a Dutch lady living

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:28.100
in the UK South East, I know she's Southwest and the Southwest part of the UK.

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.220
I saw you use the underwear picture.

01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:31.220
What's that?

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.220
Oh yeah.

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.220
The album art.

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.220
Yes.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:35.220
For your album art.

01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:37.460
The album art for a word house changes every episode.

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.460
I don't know.

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.460
It's just a thing.

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.260
Something I want to do for a house and a dark soccer has actually been probably about two

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.340
thirds of the art has come from dark soccer's pictures.

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:49.140
Uh, the third mind, I've actually tried to capture like different events that happen

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.700
in the game that people will recognize, you know, like the one I've got of, uh, my character

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.780
sitting with the turtle when you are in high jaw.

01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:57.780
Right.

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.780
So I like crazy stuff.

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:02.180
So if you like a world of Warcraft and all that, and it's a busy week, this is a busy

01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.180

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.060
Call it comic insanity.

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:22.040
Although we haven't done one for a month now because we've just had a lot of stuff going

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.220

We're pretty cool.

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.100

And you actually came back this week?

01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:46.420
No, we didn't.

01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.420
Cause she, she's in Disneyland.

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:49.420
Oh, bitch.

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.420
We're going.

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:52.180
And I mean that babe in total control of herself.

01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:53.180
We're going.

01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:54.180
Yes.

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.180
I don't know.

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.180
And it's her, it's for her birthday.

01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:59.900
I don't know how to talk about this, how openly, but there's like this awesome Disneyland trip

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:00.900
happening very soon.

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:04.860
Well, not very soon, but soon that's going to involve at least one other person, not

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:05.860
in this room.

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:07.860
It's going to be epic epicness.

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.900
So more to come on that later.

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:10.900
Anyhow.

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:11.900
All right.

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.900
Let's move on.

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.220
Rapid fire news.

01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:19.060
All the stuff that, uh, we just don't have 20 minutes to talk about, especially in light

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:23.980
of all the PSN and real world news going on tonight, but we wanted to tip our hat to these

01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:24.980
stories.

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:25.980
Oh, one thing.

01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:28.660
They said it was officially killed by the U S okay.

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:29.660
All right.

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:30.660
Of course.

01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.020
We wouldn't be announcing it if we didn't do it ourselves or we didn't say, yeah, those

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:42.220
guys in the UK, you know, we could end the show early if you guys just want to focus

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:43.220
on this.

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.960
No, I realize it's important news, but I'm just, I'm worried about the podcast he's listening

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.740
throughout the week who have probably heard this a million times by now.

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:51.740
All right.

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:52.740
Anyways.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:59.500
So red box is now finally rolling out game rentals, um, for all of their, uh, kiosks,

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.980
uh, 21,000 to be exact.

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:02.980
Well, not exactly.

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.980
I guess that's kind of an estimate.

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:11.660
Um, starting June 17th and, uh, those rentals will run you $2 a day and they're going to

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:17.700
be a guest, um, including some of the top AAA games and some family games as well.

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.500
Um, so that's pretty awesome.

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:25.300
So if you're looking for another place to rent games and you know, maybe just game flies

01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:29.740
and getting stuff to you quick enough, you can, uh, check out a red box machine, which

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:32.820
are everywhere now.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:38.920
Death Smiles 2X has been rated by the ESRB and of course we could probably expect that

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.700
on the Xbox 360 marketplace very soon.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:48.260
Um, of course they've been putting a lot of other cave shmup games on there.

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:54.500
So you know, I wouldn't expect this to be too much different than some of the other

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.500
cave shooters.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.700
But if you like your shmup games, uh, more coming.

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:00.620
So that's pretty cool.

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:05.160
And then finally, uh, first there was a leaked teaser and then officially announced Need

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:12.660
For Speed The Run is coming to stores November 15th in the North American regions, November

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.460
17th in Europe.

01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:19.860
And of course, um, it is rumored that EA Black Box is the one doing the game.

01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:24.100
And they're saying that apparently, uh, it will be kind of a cross country cannonball

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:28.300
run style game from San Francisco to New York.

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:32.300
And not only will you be racing against, you know, police and whatnot, but you'll also

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:37.140
be racing through like dense urban traffic, icy mountain passes and Nero Canyon.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.960
So kind of a little bit of, uh, you versus the elements versus police and stuff.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:48.340
So sounds pretty chaotic, might be fun and that'll be coming out this fall.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:52.620
Well did you hear the one about Marshfield, Massachusetts and you're probably like, what?

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:53.740
Unless you live there.

01:42:53.740 --> 01:43:00.380
Uh, but yeah, Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1982, they actually banned arcade games from

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:02.080
public establishments.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080
That's right.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.140
You're not allowed to have a coin op game in an establishment in Marshfield, Massachusetts.

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:09.500
It's like footloose for video games.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.500
Kind of.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:14.580
The law was actually upheld once by the state Supreme Court the next year and it's always

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:16.420
been in place since then.

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:20.760
Uh, however, uh, they might actually be, and the reason why this is relevant now, 29 years

01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:25.060
later is that they are looking at possibly reversing that law.

01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:29.260
Uh, state law actually permits Keno to be allowed in bars and other buildings.

01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:32.300
So what the hell is wrong with coin op games existing?

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:37.340
Uh, the town meeting is happening this next week and voters will be able to overturn the

01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.340
law.

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:39.540
Uh, so it'll be up to the voters.

01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:43.500
So if you know anyone there, uh, you probably want to get them to vote to overturn this

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:44.500
law.

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:47.900
Although at the same time, I suppose if they've gotten by for 29 years without coin op games

01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:50.300
in town, they'll probably get by another 29.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.260
There's also that part of me that says, what coin op games?

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:58.300
Cause you know, outside of the Tron pinball news we had earlier, there's not a lot of

01:43:58.300 --> 01:43:59.820
games going on.

01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:04.160
Anyhow, um, a game that's rumored to be coming out on the connect fruit ninja.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.300
It's a very popular game, of course, on the iPhone and iPad devices.

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.980
Fruit Ninja connect is apparently a game that's just recently been rated in Korea.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.740
That's not usually the country we get our rating board leaks from, but, uh, it is what

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:17.740
it is.

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:21.860
Fruit Ninja connect has been leaked as a rated game in Korea.

01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:24.780
Uh, of course they don't say what system this is for.

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:28.340
Well, I mean they, it's for the 360, excuse me, but they don't say if it's a disc game

01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:31.380
or an Xbox live arcade game or how it's being delivered.

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:36.460
My assumption is that it's going to be an Xbox live arcade game just based on what the

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.020
source material is.

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.660
But we won't know for a little while.

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:44.000
Uh, also one other piece of the thing came to light this week.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.500
Apparently there was a Sonic skating board game or sorry, skateboarding game that went

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.820
unreleased during the Xbox era.

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:56.620
Uh, it was discovered by a post on the Sonic retro fan site at Sonic retro.org.

01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.140
Uh, it was a game called Sonic extreme.

01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:00.700
It was by the Sonic team.

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:05.260
It was for the original Xbox and it was very similar to the skateboarding stuff in Sonic

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:09.500
adventure two, uh, but apparently it was a whole game based around it.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.540
Uh, or it could be what ended up being Sonic writers.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.220
Not sure, but there's some video out there that has leaked and you can check that out

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:23.740
either on YouTube or at that Sonic retro site, Sonic retro.org also known as when Sonic was

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:24.740
good.org.

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:26.940
That was my little joke.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:34.020
All right, let's move on, uh, to some more rapid fire news, dark Sakura.

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:41.620
While we do have some news for fans of black ops, uh, there is going to be a download content

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:47.060
pack called call of the dead as George Romero as himself.

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:51.500
Um, basically it's a lots of a zombie fan service.

01:45:51.500 --> 01:46:00.420
It's going to be making the dead go splat and uh, it should be a pretty neat.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:06.140
Then, um, we have, uh, blaze blue shirts that are going for Japan relief.

01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:11.820
Um, access games has, uh, everything on sale and I will put a link to that in the chat

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:16.540
room, but if you want to do your part, go to access games.com slash 2011 slash oh three

01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:20.640
slash 16 slash Japan dash benefit dash sale.

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.700
Or you could probably find a link from the website, but I am being nice and telling you

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.500
the whole thing.

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:32.260
And then rock band has some, uh, cool bean stuff coming up, including some, uh, culture

01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.900
club downloads.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:37.420
So let me get what's on the list for you.

01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:40.720
That's going to be of course, Xbox 360, Wii and PS3.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.060
The individual songs are going to be, do you really want to hurt me?

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:50.420
Um, from, uh, from out of nowhere by faith, no more working for the weekend by lover boys,

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:56.380
stashed by fish, tweezer by fish and big bang baby by stone temple pilots.

01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:01.660
And that last one and working for the weekend also have pro guitar bass expansions available.

01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:04.140
Oh, and so does, um, stashed by fish.

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.020
Fish is cool.

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:09.540
So yay.

01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.540
All right.

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:13.780
Um, real quick to kind of add on a little bit what you were saying about the called

01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:14.780
it an expansion.

01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:20.380
Uh, not only does it have, uh, George Romero, he is playing this crazy Uber zombie in it.

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:23.580
Uh, but it also has Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Michelle Geller.

01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:24.580
I'm sorry.

01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.340
Yeah, that would be, that's way better.

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:31.820
Sarah Michelle Parker or, uh, Sarah Jessica Parker would probably, she'd be like a plastic

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820
zombie.

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.820
Yes.

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:34.820
A plastic zombie.

01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:35.820
No.

01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:40.860
Um, Michael Rooker, uh, Danny Trejo and, uh, Robert Englund and, um, yeah, all, all kind

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:47.660
of, almost like playing themselves, you know, like they've got, you know, um, Robert Englund

01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.940
has kind of like some catch phrases that sort of, you know, hint at, you know, Nightmare

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:58.620
on Elm Street and he has a pitchfork and then Danny Trejo has a machete and, uh, Michael

01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.900
Rooker kind of looks like a biker.

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:05.660
So, um, looks pretty neat.

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:06.660
All right.

01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:08.820
Well, let's move on to some Twitter topics.

01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:14.460
Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash O L R tweet, tweet, tweet, uh, and,

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:19.060
uh, you guys send us your tweets and we read them live here on the show.

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:24.780
Let's go to, uh, the first tweet tonight from Rhetortainment tweets us saying, I like putting

01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.300
corn on my tax.

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.300
Is this weird?

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.620
I don't even like, is there a joke there?

01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:30.620
Is there an inside joke there?

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:35.300
I'm not getting, I like to put corn on my tax corn tax, like, like, I don't know.

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.980
Is that like corn on the cob or maybe a play on contact?

01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:39.980
Maybe.

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:40.980
I don't know.

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:41.980
Rhetortainment.

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:42.980
Explain yourself.

01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:43.980
All right.

01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:44.980
Flaming toilets.

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:46.580
Uh, tweeting us saying, are you going to talk about PlayStation network?

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.220
Cause nobody's talked about that yet.

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:52.260
Uh, yes, we are going to talk about it and now we're done talking about it.

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:56.740
Uh, let's see more tweets, uh, DJ Rama S tweets us and says, Hey, what's your definition

01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:57.740
of shovelware?

01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:58.740
Good question.

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.340
What's your definition of shovelware?

01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:05.580
My definition of shovelware is a game that is so blatant in copying another game.

01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.380
You just, you can't even tell.

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.380
That's right.

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:14.340
A very, very rushed game that is put out for the sole purpose of capitalizing on what's

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.340
popular.

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:21.740
In dark soccer, Loki, anything you guys want to add to that game with next to none, uh,

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:22.740
production values?

01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:24.660
I mean, it just looks like crap.

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:25.660
Everything's broken in it.

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.540
It's just think of the ditch.

01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:31.360
It's absolutely useless.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.340
You shun your friends for buying it.

01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:36.980
Is there any traditional value in dirt?

01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.980
No, neither.

01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:44.100
Is there any entertainment value of shovelware?

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.100
All right.

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.780
Let's see one or a couple more tweets.

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.780
Excuse me.

01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:51.660
Blue swim is tweeting us saying, shit, Loki, and that's it.

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.660
No shit.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:55.100
Loki talked about what I was going to call or about.

01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.380
Got to rethink my call.

01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:01.340
We could call in and just be a Loki fan and just be like, yeah, I agree with you, man.

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:03.420
On second thought, let's not inflate his ego anymore.

01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.420
All right.

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.700
Uh, other tweets.

01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:06.860
Oh, this is one.

01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:07.860
Yeah.

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:08.860
Gosh.

01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:09.860
This slipped off the radar here.

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.860
We want to say something about this.

01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:11.860
Thank you to tiger claw who tweeted this.

01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:15.660
There were some details on Marvel universe because you know, DC universe online cannot

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:16.660
go unchallenged.

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.780
Uh, there were some details on Marvel universe revealed this week.

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.900
It was at a event in San Francisco by gazillion.

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.620
Uh, the game is being developed by secret identity.

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:29.020
Uh, that's a team that was specifically assembled to make the MMO.

01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:32.140
It's going to be a free to play MMO.

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.180
Get that Marvel universe is going to be free dark soccer.

01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:36.180
Any interest in that?

01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.180
A free to play Marvel MMO.

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:38.180
I'll be all over that.

01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.180
Yeah.

01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:40.180
Is it a freemium?

01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:43.580
Uh, well I'm assuming it has to be, if it's free to play, it's freemium.

01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:44.580
Absolutely.

01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:47.420
Um, but oh, I've actually remembered reading something about this.

01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:54.500
Um, cause I follow, um, uh, agent M on Twitter and apparently I think he said it or somebody

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:57.660
with Marvel said it that Bendis has a hand in the writing.

01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:58.660
So that's pretty cool.

01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:02.060
Uh, dr doom is going to be the antagonist, at least in the launch of the game.

01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:05.580
They're saying that you will be able to play as famous Marvel heroes, captain America,

01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:11.100
iron man, Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, Nova, and squirrel girl squirrel girl is awesome.

01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:12.100
I have no idea.

01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:16.940
I mean, if everybody's the hero, so there must be like an instance thing or maybe kind

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:20.620
of what they do in DC universe where it's, I don't know, it's Jessica Jones.

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:21.900
I'm very curious.

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:25.300
Uh, Brian Michael Bendis is doing some writing for the game.

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:28.540
Uh, the game story missions are taken from the comic themselves.

01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.100
Uh, otherwise don't know if it has to do with anything to do with the Marvel universe online.

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:37.900
The cryptic was once developing in Microsoft, uh, before that project was canceled.

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:40.700
So this is all about the PC universe of the game.

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:45.020
Gazillion is saying that, uh, originally it was developed for consoles as well, but they

01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:48.860
are not confirming or denying if it's still coming to consoles at this time.

01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:50.340
Squirrel girl is awesome.

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:52.260
Who is squirrel girl for the uninitiated?

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:55.940
Squirrel girl, her mutant power is basically being an anthropomorphic squirrel and she

01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:57.140
can talk telepathically.

01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:59.420
She can talk to squirrels and understand their language.

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:03.340
But the thing is, is that she's actually defeated Dr. Doom and Thanos, the real thing by the

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:08.660
way, and all kinds of just bad guys and also kicked Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Avengers

01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:13.140
mansion and told him to shut his evil, evil pie hole.

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:14.140
She's super fun.

01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:18.540
Actually, right now she's the babysitter, well, I guess nanny slash babysitter for Jessica

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.540
Jones and Luke Cage's baby.

01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:20.540
The nanny.

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:27.280
But I, Mr. Sheffield, I, you know, I like, I like some, some of the cheese ball characters

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:30.020
and she's cheese ball, but actually cheese ball in a fun way.

01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:34.900
I want to have a character in Marvel universe that's the nanny as a superhero.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:41.060
There actually was a, was, um, a bad guy who was a nanny and orphan maker.

01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:42.500
Or super nanny.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.300
You've been very, very naughty.

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.980
Now you need to go to the naughty corner.

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.540
It was nanny and orphan maker.

01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:49.540
Okay.

01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.540
All right, let's move on.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.300
Yes, I know my obscure.

01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:55.460
Another tweet from Tiger Claw.

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:59.180
This show, this show started off so well and then there's this stuff going on in the real

01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:01.740
world and now it's just, oh, who cares anymore?

01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:02.740
All right.

01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.760
A tweet, another tweet from Tiger Claw.

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.020
It's about LA noir.

01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:09.860
Um, there'll be social, I guess there's a social club for this.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:10.860
Uh, what is this?

01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:11.860
Is this on Facebook or something?

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:13.420
It's rockstar social club.

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:15.420
It's it's a website thing that they have.

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:17.020
It's tied in with all rockstar games.

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:18.020
Okay.

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:22.060
Well, if you get through the whole thing, you get a exclusive outfit for the game.

01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:24.380
So I guess it's an incentive to get in on that thing.

01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.900
If you're into that, if you're like, uh, if you're into the Barbie doll stuff in your

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:27.900
video games.

01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:28.900
No, social club's pretty fun.

01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:31.940
They had a bunch of stuff with Grand Theft Auto like they did, uh, you know, they have

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:37.340
the leaderboards for multiplayer, which I, you know, paid attention to a lot for a while.

01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:41.340
Um, they had things like the Grand Theft, it was a delivery city marathon where they

01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:46.540
tracked how long, how far you ran, how far you drove, you know, how many bullets you

01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:47.980
spent, that kind of stuff.

01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:51.100
So they do a bunch of different things and then also they do stuff with like Red Dead

01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:55.700
Redemption with, um, you know, they have little challenges that you do and you unlock skins

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.860
and stuff like that through those challenges.

01:53:57.860 --> 01:53:59.860
So that's kind of neat.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.900
Uh, yeah, the costume you're going to unlock on the social club, if you're a member, the

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:08.900
Chicago lightning suit, it's for the protagonist, Cole Phillips, in the game.

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:14.060
And if you're online, you get to access the ask the community feature in game.

01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.820
And if you're interrogating a suspect, you don't know if they're telling the truth or

01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:20.660
not, you can see how other players responded in the same situation.

01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:24.940
They're calling it a who wants to be a millionaire, ask the audience lifeline.

01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:25.940
That's kind of crazy.

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:28.100
I like, I like that kind of idea for games though.

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:33.300
Well, they had a thing come out, um, you know, about that game as well, where if you were

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:39.820
having trouble in certain spots and whatnot, you could actually, um, bypass some of the

01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:42.060
action sequences in the game.

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:46.140
So like if you keep failing over and over and over again, um, you can just skip past

01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:50.140
it and get back to the narrative stuff, which is kind of unique.

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:56.180
All right, uh, let's move on with, uh, some more gaming news.

01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:59.780
That was it for Twitter topics tonight, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to talk to us throughout

01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.780
the week.

01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.780
Back to some other news.

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:02.780
Loki.

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:09.300
Uh, Gamasutra ran kind of a editorial about the whole PlayStation, you know, debacle,

01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:10.940
I guess, right now.

01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:16.060
Basically they were saying, you know, the PlayStation brand faces an uncertain future

01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:20.420
and they're worried that, you know, Sony's kind of, well, as we kind of put it before,

01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:22.140
not handling the situation correctly.

01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:25.340
Like for example, here's a little test for you.

01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:28.980
Which of the following statements are most likely, are you most likely to agree with

01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:30.900
in a one year's term?

01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:33.340
A, Sony handled the situation amazingly.

01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:36.500
They held up their hands and took appropriate share of the blame.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:40.600
They outlined a clear plan of action to remedy the situation and made sure that all stakeholders

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:46.460
were recompensed beyond reasonable expectations.

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:52.980
And they showed their human side and came out of this a stronger company.

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:55.820
Or B, it just kind of went away, didn't it?

01:55:55.820 --> 01:56:01.580
Sony entirely laid the blame on hackers, launched a lot of legal flak, refused to take any responsibility,

01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:07.160
offered minimum clarity and token recompense.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:11.780
That no one cares anymore, at least they've encrypted my personal data now.

01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:16.180
And of course, you know, most people probably agree with B.

01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:19.340
And even like, you know, they were saying like, you know, their response has been pretty

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:20.340
pitiful.

01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.860
You know, the best they did was sent out an email and posted a post on their blog.

01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:32.020
I mean, if you even read it, they said, we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern

01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:33.500
this outage has caused.

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:37.260
You know, they're saying this outage is like it's inclement weather.

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.860
And they also said, we made a mistake here.

01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:40.860
We picked a fight.

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:41.860
We couldn't win.

01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:44.420
Or no, they're saying they should have said, we made a mistake here.

01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:45.420
We picked a fight.

01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.420
We couldn't win.

01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:52.140
And even with TAC, highly likely, we neglected the protector stuff.

01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:58.060
So you know, what they're saying is they could handle this, you know, in a way that could

01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:03.340
kind of get people to trust them again, you know, just kind of showing their human side.

01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:07.180
But without it, you know, and it kind of like what we were going back to before with, you

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:12.100
know, talking about Jack in the Box and, you know, that's something they mentioned JetBlue,

01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:15.820
for example, had, you know, kind of a debacle.

01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:23.940
And they ended up coming out of a better company because they spent time, effort to, you know,

01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:29.300
improve their customer service and, you know, in turn, they became a strong company.

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:34.140
So Domino's Pizza, Toyota, you know, those are some of the brands that were kind of hard

01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:40.820
by, you know, a situation like this, but then they kind of turned it around with their,

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:45.420
you know, dedication to, you know, kind of changing their ways.

01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:48.020
Sony so far have said, you know, here's some DLC.

01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:52.380
Oh yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to protect your data now.

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:54.460
So I think they're kind of right.

01:57:54.460 --> 01:58:00.100
I don't know, I think that PlayStation brand as far as trusting them with, you know, my

01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:08.420
information, maybe, maybe that's harmed a bit, but they're kind of stretching the PlayStation

01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:12.140
brand a little thin, if you ask me, especially with like tablet devices and stuff now.

01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:15.340
It's like, just because it plays PlayStation one games, I don't really know if you should

01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:17.700
call it like a PlayStation device.

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:19.340
Uh, yeah.

01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:22.700
And you know, I, I hate to kind of beat a dead horse because we were talking about this

01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:26.540
in part A anyway, and it's kind of like, I really think Sony can recover from this despite

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:30.500
what all the, uh, rampant angry gamer chat on the internet would make you think.

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:34.380
Uh, but you know, it's like Microsoft recovered from the red ring of death thing and let's

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:36.780
be real, that was a pretty serious thing that happened.

01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:41.180
But Nintendo recovered from, well, the virtual boy.

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:46.380
So you know, companies can recover and they will, but they have to do the right thing.

01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:47.380
Yeah, exactly.

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:49.060
Like being hard headed is not the right thing.

01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:53.420
And granted Microsoft, I think they never really came up, obviously they didn't come

01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:57.820
up front and say how many of their systems were affected by the red ring problem.

01:58:57.820 --> 01:58:58.820
Here's a hint.

01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:00.640
It was all of them at launch.

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.940
Every single one, every single one will die eventually.

01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:07.740
I know this, it will happen.

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:08.900
Every single one.

01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:09.900
You'll be lucky.

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.660
I would, I don't know.

01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:16.300
I would be very impressed to see a system that actually is one of their launch systems

01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:19.660
that's still working today, that's being rigorously played.

01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.780
I guarantee that there's less than like one percent.

01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:27.380
But anyways, let's be honest, they fixed it after multiple iterations and tweaks and stuff

01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.380
like that.

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:29.740
Now their system is stable.

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:33.100
It's not, you know, it's not dying.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:37.220
They improved their warranties and stuff, you know, three years and stuff and they covered

01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:38.700
replacements for a lot of it.

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:42.380
So yeah, it sucked having to replace the system like a bunch of times and stuff.

01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:45.540
Apple and the iPhone 4, that's another big one too with the antenna gate.

01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:46.540
Remember that?

01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:47.540
Oh yeah.

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:48.540
And they've recovered fine.

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:51.180
iPads 2s are selling like crazy.

01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:58.940
But it's all about how you handle it, and I mean really, I'm sorry, not everyone reads

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:00.800
the Playstation blog, okay?

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.900
If you're looking at your average mom and pop users, say they have, you know, sign up

02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:08.420
on the Playstation network and they buy stuff through there, they're not reading the internet

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:11.920
blogs, you know, and stuff, and yeah, okay, they get an email.

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:17.500
So let's just say, for example, that they used an email with that service that maybe

02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:19.140
they don't use that quite regularly.

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:23.860
So they would have absolutely no idea this is going on until they hear it from like a

02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:29.180
media outlet saying, oh yeah, Sony's just, you know, been hacked and all these people's

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:32.980
credit information, you know, credit card information has been leaked out.

02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:33.980
Ah!

02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:35.840
That's not good.

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:41.100
I mean you need to be telling your customers up front, or at least, you know, being a little

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:45.900
bit more clear about it, put out a statement or something, you know, I know that they did

02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:52.500
the press conference thing, but I'm sorry though, you're just pointing blame, so.

02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:58.580
But we'll see, it'll be interesting, E3 I'm sure they're gonna mention something, I mean,

02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:02.860
obviously it's still gonna be fresh in everybody's mind.

02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:07.540
Alright well, obviously it's not just Sony with news in the world right now, Xbox, they

02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.100
had a pretty big thing come out this week.

02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:14.620
Hulu Plus actually just came out to the system, it was released on April 29th, and yeah, it

02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:18.580
was kind of fast, like the news came out during the week and then suddenly, whoo, bam, there's

02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:19.700
Hulu Plus.

02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:24.700
Now there is actually this whole sponsorship going on, and I apologize, I forgot the company

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.900
that was sponsoring it, but it doesn't matter, they're not paying us.

02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:32.820
So some company is actually sponsoring a two week preview of Hulu Plus right now, and then

02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:36.700
I guess you can also get another one if you actually sign up through Hulu's website, and

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:38.820
you get a two week trial there as well.

02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:42.980
So if you wanna try out Hulu Plus for like a month, you can do so.

02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:46.580
I have not signed up for it and probably I'm not going to, I think Hulu Plus is kind of

02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:50.100
a shitty idea, because I'm not a fan of the fact that there's still commercials and you're

02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:51.100
paying for it.

02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:55.540
Like honestly, I've got Netflix, it's got the shows I wanna see, otherwise if they don't

02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:57.380
have it, I'll just torrent it.

02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:02.300
Like I'm not, you know, not to come out and admit that I'm a bloody thief or whatever,

02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:07.020
but like I'd use Hulu if it was money or commercials, but not both.

02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:12.020
That's just ridiculous to me, make your money one way or the other.

02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:15.060
So yeah, I guess they have a lot of good stuff though.

02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:18.420
I mean the free Hulu online is kind of cool, I kind of wish you could do free Hulu through

02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:22.500
the Xbox, the ad supported, because you can watch like the entire run of Dark Shadows

02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:23.500
through Hulu.

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.660
But you know what, Netflix just got Twin Peaks like a couple weeks ago, and seriously if

02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:28.360
you guys have never watched Twin Peaks, it's awesome.

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:31.020
You can do Hulu through your Xbox.

02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.020
How?

02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:33.400
Diversity.

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:34.400
You have to.

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.400
Oh right.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:41.060
You can do diversity, you can watch your cues through pretty much any device that'll do

02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.060
streaming.

02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:43.820
I use my Playstation 3 for that.

02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:45.740
It actually works pretty well for that.

02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:50.700
Hulu doesn't look that great though because it's kind of low resolution, but we've watched

02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.820
a few episodes of The Office that we were missing when we were catching up, you know,

02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:59.900
all the seasons and stuff, but yeah, it does kind of suck that, now I know what they're

02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:03.560
saying, well you pay for cable and there's commercials there too, but yeah.

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:11.820
But I, you know, I don't need you quite as much as I need, you know, other TV.

02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:12.820
I guess.

02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:16.140
It's like stop being greedy about it.

02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:19.580
Alright well let's move on with some more stories, Dark Sakura.

02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:26.300
Well in other news, we do have something for the 3DS, Excitebike 3D Classic is going to

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.640
be offered on the 3DS for free!

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:35.100
When the 3DS eShop goes live, this is going to be a part of it.

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:44.140
And like I said, it's 3D Excitebike, so you get it in full lenticular motion, but they

02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:48.620
didn't say where it was going to be for, but it could possibly just be Japan.

02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:50.740
Here's what's kind of retarded.

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:56.540
I don't know if anyone's actually seen a Japanese 3DS, I mean, I have, but in the beginning

02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:01.100
of their, you know how we have this, you know, OK Go video, well they got this, you know,

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:06.580
Mario live music performance thing over there as the free 3D video.

02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:12.300
And before that actually starts, they have a 3D picture of Super Mario Bros. 1.

02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:17.100
And the way they show that is exactly how they're doing this.

02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:21.140
Basically, you know, most of these 8-bit games have different sprite layers.

02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:22.140
That's all they're doing.

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:24.100
Each sprite layer is a different depth.

02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:25.100
That is it.

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:32.260
I was showing it at E3, Xevious was the old 8-bit game and the ground was one sprite layer

02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:36.300
and that was in the background and then all the other sprites were on top.

02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:37.900
It was a neat effect to see.

02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:41.860
I mean, it's cool, but I would not spend very much money.

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:47.960
I mean, the game is going to have to be like a true NES classic that I just, I need to

02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.300
have on my DS.

02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:50.860
Like that's the only way I'm going to buy it again.

02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:51.860
But see, that's what they're doing.

02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:52.860
I got burned on the list.

02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:58.100
They're just, they have an emulator now, obviously, that works with these, I mean, come on, anything

02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:01.240
can run an NES emulator nowadays.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:09.140
So they have an NES emulator that just spreads out the sprite layers.

02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:11.880
When homebrew comes out, I'm sure someone will come up with that.

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:13.880
It's not that complicated.

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:14.880
But you know what they're going to do?

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:18.620
They're going to charge you like 4 bucks for each one of those games because people will

02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:23.020
buy them, even though it's really not worth the effort that they put in to develop this

02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:24.020
emulator.

02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:29.660
It would be really nice if, like, they would just give us a kickback because we bought

02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:31.220
it on Wii Virtual Console.

02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:32.980
I mean, I know that's not going to happen.

02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:34.380
I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice?

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:37.580
It would be nice, but they don't really, I mean, they have accounts that are tied to

02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:41.260
the Wii, but it's not an account that you can take everywhere.

02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:44.300
It's basically just an account that's tied to that console.

02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:49.700
You know, if they had an actual centralized online community or something like that, then

02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:51.060
yeah, something like that could happen.

02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:54.460
Well hey, I see they purchased Mario Brothers on the Wii.

02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:55.460
Guess what?

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:56.460
You get the 3D version for free.

02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:01.400
Which they really should do because it's like a few kilobytes worth of data.

02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:05.700
And yeah, I'm sure that emulator really took some time.

02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:08.500
You just probably ported the one from the Wii over to the DS.

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:13.260
Oh fuck, I mean, people have been running NES emulators on the DS forever.

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:16.620
I mean, all you'd have to do is just tweak the display so that each sprite layer is a

02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:18.380
different layer of 3D.

02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.540
I mean, that's not hard.

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.540
It's not difficult.

02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:24.300
And it's very minimal.

02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:28.700
So yeah, that should be free.

02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:29.700
But it won't be.

02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:32.180
I mean, after all, how else are these things going to print money?

02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:33.180
Even just a discount.

02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:35.360
Even just like a little discount or something.

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:39.700
Or maybe like if I get enough Nintendo achievements, I know, right?

02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:45.580
I could like get one for free, or like, you know, one or two upgrades.

02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:46.980
That's all they really should be charging for this stuff.

02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:48.980
Yeah, charge me $0.99.

02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:49.980
That'd be great.

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:53.700
And if I don't own the game at all, then fine, charge me $5.99.

02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:56.180
Five what the game would have cost, and the extra $0.99 for the 3D.

02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:59.100
No, it should not even be $6 for an old NES game.

02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:02.280
I'm sorry, no.

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.500
Some are worth it, but very few.

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:08.240
Some are worth it.

02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:11.540
But at the same time, I mean, I can go buy the original on cartridge, but sometimes the

02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:13.660
original cartridges will cost you more than five bucks.

02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.620
Just depends on what game you're talking about.

02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:18.540
Seriously, especially if you're trying to fill up your Tangen collection.

02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:19.540
Yeah.

02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.540
Which, by the way, Afterburner is mentioned.

02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:25.940
And I have your Fantasy Zone, if you didn't know that.

02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:26.940
Yes, I do.

02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:27.940
Okay.

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:28.940
Yeah, didn't I lend it to you?

02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:29.940
Yeah, you did.

02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:30.940
So, just so you know.

02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:31.940
Okay, cool.

02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:40.340
As I was mentioning, Afterburner, they did a Tangen one for NES, just thought I'd mention

02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:41.340
that.

02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:44.780
Comment in our chatroom on, from ToaGak, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo ripped off

02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:46.740
a homebrew emulator.

02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:48.140
Loki?

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:53.100
Um, I don't think that they need to, because they've got an emulator for the Wii.

02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:54.380
They've got all the tech docs they need.

02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:59.500
They've got an emulator for a Wii, they had cartridges on the Game Boy Advance, or even

02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:05.980
I think the Game Boy Color, they had NES cartridges.

02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:09.420
So they've got, I mean, hell, they have an emulator that runs on the Game Boy.

02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:12.060
It's obviously gonna run on the 3DS.

02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:14.220
So they have that kind of data there.

02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:17.580
It's just minimal tweaking to get it to be in 3D.

02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:21.900
Seriously, it's not any special effects that they're adding or anything.

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:25.780
I mean, if it was some Mode 7 games or something like that, that might be a little bit cooler

02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:33.900
if those were in 3D, because they had a lot of scaling there, but just doing, like, separating

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:38.300
the sprite layers is, I'm sorry, it's like child's play stuff.

02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:42.860
It's just really, people are gonna find it neat, but once again, they're selling you

02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:43.960
on the gimmick.

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:47.220
They're selling you on your memories of these retro games, because they're like, oh my god,

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:51.300
Nintendo games, oh, it's in 3D now!

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:57.300
Seriously, you're gonna buy into that, and you're just only encouraging them to spend

02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:00.700
what little effort they will on this stuff.

02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:03.700
But hey, you know what, if that's what you want, then fine.

02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.820
Because they're not gonna change their ways anytime soon.

02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:10.600
So whatever, you know, buy what you want.

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.500
It's my money, I'll spend it how I want.

02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.500
Yeah, pretty much.

02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:17.580
How much did you pay to import the Japanese 3DS again?

02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:18.580
I forgot.

02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:21.420
Could you remind me how much?

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:22.580
I liked getting stuff early.

02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:24.580
I know, I'm just messing with you.

02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:25.580
And then I sold it.

02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:29.260
I'm just giving you shit, that is my role on the show, okay?

02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:33.020
Dark Soccer's role is to be the girl, your role is to be the tech master, and mine is

02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:34.540
to give the both of you shit.

02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:36.380
Yeah, but here's the thing.

02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:38.100
I'm not just a girl.

02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:41.300
Well, I was gonna say a bitch, but I thought that would be me.

02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:42.700
I know, that's awesome.

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:48.020
I would almost consider selling that 3DS again, just to get rid of it, because I'm not playing

02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:49.740
anything on it, really, right now.

02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:53.340
And I have a feeling it's just gonna be collecting dust, like my DS is.

02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:57.300
And you know, I may just...

02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:58.300
But what's the point?

02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:00.300
You know, because I'll probably want a game later on down the road.

02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:03.740
But you better be...

02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:09.060
And yeah, when the new Nintendo console comes out, I probably will have to buy it, because

02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:11.660
it'll be spiffy and new, and I like new things.

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:17.660
But I will seriously think about it, I mean, because if they don't have some really awesome

02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:22.140
games at launch, then count me out.

02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.940
I'll wait until some future versions come out.

02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:32.380
I'm not gonna be so impulse-crazy nowadays, because it really doesn't get me anything.

02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:33.380
What?

02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:35.940
Oh, okay, I got to play Ridge Racer in 3D for a little bit.

02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:39.540
Yeah, that's cool, but I don't know.

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:42.780
It's not that big of a deal.

02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:46.220
And it all really matters about the cost of that console, because man, that thing's like

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:49.900
three hundred dollars plus a hundred dollars for the controller.

02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.540
Nope.

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:53.540
Or maybe.

02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:57.980
Alright, let's move on with some, what, hacking news, right?

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:01.860
Yeah, the PlayStation Network's not the only thing that's being hacked.

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:08.380
Of course, there's kind of been a struggle between hackers creating custom firmwares

02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:14.820
for the drives of the consoles, and then of course Microsoft in updating those.

02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:18.180
They have the new firmware that's gonna be coming out, or the new dashboard update that's

02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:25.860
gonna kind of tweak the disks as well as enabling what they call AP 2.5 on all the games.

02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:31.620
It's basically a new copy protection that they have right now on a couple of the Call

02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:36.700
of Duty games, and on Assassin's Creed and actually some of the newer games.

02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:39.980
Of course, all that stuff can be patched.

02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:45.020
But there's some interesting things coming out, and some of this almost similar to the

02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:46.420
PlayStation 3.

02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:53.460
For example, there is a device coming out called the Xbox, or the X360 key.

02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:57.780
It'll allow you to play any game from a USB drive.

02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:02.940
And what it's basically gonna be, it's gonna be a device that connects in between your

02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:08.300
Xbox 360, the SATA connection that's on there, and the DVD drive.

02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:14.100
And it will allow it to emulate the actual DVD drive itself, so make it think that it's

02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:20.700
playing disks off the drive when it's actually playing ISOs off a USB drive or a hard drive.

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:22.980
And actually the system has Linux running on it.

02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:26.060
It's fully upgradeable.

02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:33.400
And I guess it's gonna have protection against whatever the AP 25 protection emulation is

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:35.480
well built in there.

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:40.260
No word on when it's coming out yet, but I've seen initial costs on it, it's 120 bucks.

02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:43.260
So I guess we'll have to see if this actually works out and stuff.

02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:48.080
But if that's the case though, it will actually allow you to do all that without having to

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:49.080
mod your system.

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:52.860
Of course, you'll still have to open it up.

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:58.180
And then of course, if that's not your way to go, the Commodore Forever, they announced

02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:05.260
that they're gonna have a new iXtreme LT firmware for all drives, including Commodore

02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:06.260
Forever.

02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:08.420
You're gonna be able to put Gios on your 360?

02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:09.540
No you're not.

02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:11.340
It's the hacking group, Commodore Forever.

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:12.340
Play Last Ninja?

02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:16.020
They've been working on firmwares for the drives for a long time.

02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:21.900
They say their LT 2.0 supports the XG-D3, which is the new disk format that Microsoft's

02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:24.300
putting out to gain that extra one gig.

02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:32.300
And also the slim, light-on 0225 drive, which was unhackable as of right now.

02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:37.420
So apparently that will allow you to bypass all this different protection and allow you

02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:38.420
to flash your drives.

02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:41.180
And it's supposed to be untraceable as of right now.

02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:47.840
And I know the light touch stuff has been pretty stealthy as far as live goes, so that's

02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:48.840
kind of interesting.

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:56.960
And the last thing was another device called Xbox 360 Optical Drive Emulation.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:04.620
And it's an emulator that will be a little bit similar to the 360 key, whereas a device

02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:12.740
set will make it look like it's running actual disks when it's running stuff off of a hard

02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:14.780
drive.

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:15.780
Very interesting.

02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:22.980
A lot of this stuff can be patched out with one firmware update, but some of this, especially

02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:29.380
with the custom firmwares for the disk drives, it's back and forth with them.

02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:33.580
And actually the new firmware that's coming out, if you do have a flash device right now,

02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:37.460
what it's going to do is it's going to flash it back to stock, and then it's going to copy

02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:42.140
protect it, I guess, so that you can't adjust the firmware that's on your drive.

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:46.540
So that's kind of interesting.

02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:51.100
So how long before we're emulating the actual Xbox 360, like on our PCs?

02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:57.460
A long time, because we're talking like multi-core processors and emulating that stuff.

02:14:57.460 --> 02:15:02.300
It's going to take a long time before we're able to do that, a few years.

02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:04.220
All right.

02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:11.220
Well let's move on with some more gaming news, and this one has to do with the iPhone.

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:16.900
And apparently, this is something I actually did a double take, and I was like, what is

02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:19.100
this being posted in our show roll thread for?

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.460
Haven't we reported on this before?

02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:23.420
Well we have, but we haven't.

02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:27.620
And what I mean is, this is yet another game that has appeared on the iTunes app store

02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:30.220
that was copied off of a flash game.

02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:33.460
The game is called Achilles Defense.

02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:41.180
It was available on the iTunes store by, they're based in Hanoi, Vietnam, PTT Solution.

02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:45.780
It is a ripoff of Ironhide's Clash of the Olympians, Ironhide Game Studio, excuse me,

02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:48.060
Clash of the Olympians.

02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:53.020
The only difference is, Ironhide's game has three characters, PTT's app has one.

02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:57.340
The music, the artwork, the gameplay, it is all the same.

02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:59.860
Clash of the Olympians came out in August of last year.

02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:03.420
You can play that online at ironhidegames.com.

02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:05.940
Achilles Defense came out on April 18th.

02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:11.300
It was offered for free, and now it's down to, I'm sorry, up to a 99% price.

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:17.140
Of course, some people are review spamming that, but needless to say, it's there.

02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:18.740
It's been on the app store.

02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:20.700
How does Apple prevent this?

02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:24.820
I mean, because they don't really screen the content of games.

02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:25.820
I don't know.

02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:28.940
Like, obviously this news is very sad to that development company who, you know, had the

02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:30.420
game out there for free that somebody totally ripped off.

02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:32.100
Did you see the Mario ripoff on there too?

02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:34.980
Yeah, I mean, that was the other, I think, thing that had come out before.

02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:41.640
There's a Mario ripoff, and then there was that other game too that had come out, so.

02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:46.300
The blocks cometh, and then there was also some bunny game, bunny fighting game.

02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:49.580
That was less of a ripoff and more of, like, a rights issue.

02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:53.300
Who owned the rights to it and stuff, but the other one was a complete ripoff.

02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:59.980
For the record, Ironhide is pissed, and they wrote Apple to complain, and they want gamers

02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:04.060
to help assist them by lodging their own complaints in the game's comment space.

02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:06.500
So they're encouraging people to downvote this thing.

02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:11.020
Now it is the weekend, so I don't know what's gonna happen, but come Monday I'm sure it's,

02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:14.060
you know, gonna get crazy.

02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:18.100
And maybe Apple will pull it down, I don't know.

02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:19.100
So.

02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:20.100
Alright.

02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:21.100
Anyhow.

02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:24.580
Uh, let's move on to the mailbag.

02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:27.340
Oh, and boy, we've got a fun one this week.

02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:31.700
Because Dark Soccer got a taco before the show started, and she was only getting that

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:33.140
taco if we got ten emails.

02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:34.140
But you got more than that.

02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:35.140
You got more than that.

02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:37.500
Now, I don't know if she's reading every single one.

02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:38.580
I'm doubting that, right?

02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:39.580
No, I'm not.

02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:45.500
Pretty much anything that's repeating the emails that Sony sent out for PSN, and our

02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.540
rehashes of things we've already discussed, I'm not reading them.

02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:50.940
Let me give you a super tip if you want to email the show.

02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:53.820
Remember, the show is about where every gamer has a voice.

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.220
And sometimes people want to email us to clue us into news and things that are going on,

02:17:57.220 --> 02:18:00.620
which is fine, especially because sometimes we miss those things, they fall off the radar,

02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:04.660
like the case of the Marvel Universe thing earlier in the show, and Tigerclaw got that

02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:05.920
to our attention via Twitter.

02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.180
But if everybody's talking about it, like the PSN thing, we're probably going to cover

02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:11.520
it in the show.

02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:14.220
We want to know your thoughts.

02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:15.700
Don't just regurgitate the news.

02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.020
Tell us what you think.

02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:21.700
A better email will tell us about what you plan to do because of the Sony hack, which

02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.940
I imagine we're going to get to in some of these emails.

02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:27.660
Some of them were that they were also repeat emailers, and I'm trying to give new people

02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:28.660
attention too.

02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:29.660
Sure.

02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:30.660
Absolutely.

02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:31.660
Absolutely.

02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:32.660
As it is.

02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:35.340
If you've had a lot of emails, if your voice has been heard a lot, don't be butthurt that

02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.900
we do some other people tonight.

02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:39.220
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:40.220
I'm reading eleven of them.

02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:41.220
Oh shit.

02:18:41.220 --> 02:18:42.220
All right.

02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:43.220
Well, here we go then.

02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:44.220
Okay.

02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:45.220
This one.

02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:46.220
It's taco time.

02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:49.980
Join our valiant chef, Dark Sakura, on her quest to defeat the evil Montezuma and his

02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:50.980
army of veggies.

02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:55.180
Will our hero be able to stop a digestive disaster and create the perfect taco?

02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:56.340
With your help she can.

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:57.460
Only for Xbox 360.

02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:00.300
Pre-order today and receive an official taco time salsa spoon.

02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:01.300
All right.

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:02.940
I know this has been terribly lame, but I couldn't resist.

02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:05.860
I hope you at least get a chuckle out of this.

02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:08.620
I've been a long time listener, but this is my first time writing in.

02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:13.020
You guys helped me survive my boring job, so keep up the gaming news and crazy tangents.

02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:14.540
Feed Jamie tacos now.

02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:15.540
That's from Panaxium.

02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:16.540
Fine.

02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:17.540
We fed her.

02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:18.540
And he sent me a picture.

02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:19.820
Be quiet.

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:20.820
Taco time.

02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:21.820
Oh, this is great.

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.080
Oh, that's awesome.

02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:27.700
They actually put your picture in the little chef's hat on taco time.

02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:29.660
This is actually a pretty decent photo shopping.

02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:30.660
I'm saving it.

02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:33.220
This is the orange launch radio website thingy.

02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:36.460
We have the super secret email now, so we stopped getting the goatee pictures.

02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:37.460
I'll let you do that, Rob.

02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.460
Well, I don't.

02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:39.460
All right.

02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:40.460
Fine.

02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:41.460
I'll look it up.

02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:42.460
I'll take care of it.

02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:43.460
Forward it to me so I do it.

02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:44.460
Okay.

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:45.460
I'll take care of it later.

02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:46.460
Don't worry.

02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:47.460
I downloaded it.

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:48.460
Okay.

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:49.460
This one.

02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:51.940
Dear OLR, it's been a while since I last emailed you guys.

02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:53.100
I also miss listening live.

02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:55.100
I really need to get back into the habit of doing that.

02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:56.100
Yes, you do.

02:19:56.100 --> 02:20:00.980
Anyways, I just got through with changing pretty much all of my passwords on multiple

02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:06.420
sites as well as notifying my bank of the PSN intrusion compromising my account.

02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:09.100
Honestly, this has been a huge wakeup call for me.

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:13.420
Never before have I been this concerned about my personal information on the internet.

02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:17.440
Sony's failure to protect my privacy and resolve this issue as quickly as possible really has

02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:21.420
me thinking twice about my future purchases on the PSN.

02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.380
I have heard of PSN cards like you buy in the stores, sort of like the Xbox Live or

02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:26.700
iTunes cards.

02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:29.380
That seems like a safer route to go.

02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:33.860
On a lighter note, have any of you checked out Sonic Colors for the Wii?

02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:37.500
Before Sonic Generations comes out, I highly recommend that you don't miss out on this

02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:38.500
game.

02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:41.620
Actually, that's the one I was wanting to get, but we loaned out our Wii.

02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:42.620
It's really a lot of fun.

02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:43.620
Great soundtrack as well.

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:47.580
Sega focused a lot more on the game design and gameplay rather than story this time around.

02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:53.540
But I have no issue there other than rolling my eyes at some of the cheesy lines in the

02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:54.540
cut scenes.

02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:55.540
So that's all for now.

02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:56.540
Thanks for reading Ospher.

02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:00.180
P.S. how about that Xbox 360 OLR autographed faceplate?

02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:01.180
Ah, fuck.

02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:04.380
You know, I just actually found a bunch of faceplates.

02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:06.560
So, okay.

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:11.740
I'm going to email you back with my real email so that you can email me and we'll work on

02:21:11.740 --> 02:21:12.740
it, okay?

02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:15.740
Hello there, OrangeLones Radio.

02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:20.140
I feel compelled to take the time out of my busy night to write you, I said busy, I meant

02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:24.900
busy, night to write you this email as the three of you on occasion entertain the masses.

02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:30.460
I found your show while being very bored at work on Stitcher today because at 1330 hours

02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:35.060
I was actually going through the mini podcast and I found yours to be the most enjoyable.

02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:38.580
To be honest, I never really listened to any type of podcast.

02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:43.040
I was bored of my music mixes on my Blackberry and wanted to hear people talk about topics

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.140
I enjoy.

02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:48.780
And yes, after listening I was heavily informed about what's what in gaming and not to mention

02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:50.980
walked away with a craving of tacos.

02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:54.820
I will be subscribing via iTunes but sadly not too many of my friends are gamers so I

02:21:54.820 --> 02:22:00.420
don't really have anyone to tell as I work executive protection and the three friends

02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:03.340
I would rather talk about weapon calibers.

02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:08.540
But I will be trying to tune in while you are live on Sundays from now on so thanks

02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:09.540
for the great podcast.

02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:12.640
I love it and I found something new to look forward to at the end of the week.

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:13.640
Thank you all.

02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:14.640
Shattered Hawk.

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:15.640
P.S.

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:16.840
DarkSark, if you like tacos you should try Navajo tacos.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:22.260
Your head will explode from the pure deliciousness of this dish.

02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:24.380
Well if I can find them.

02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:25.380
Sounds good.

02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.380
I love tacos.

02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:27.380
Is that a chain or is that a type of taco?

02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:28.700
I don't know.

02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:29.700
We need more.

02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:32.860
We need either a recipe or we need a FedEx box to show up at the house.

02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:33.860
More info.

02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:34.860
Give us the 411.

02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:36.580
Ah, you see what I did there.

02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:38.580
I'm clever.

02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:39.580
Nice.

02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:41.060
Okay.

02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:47.080
I was wondering regarding the PSN hack slash outage, hack slash, if the possible phishing

02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:54.060
email I wrote about at the end of May had anything in relation to the intrusion.

02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:58.820
The email did seem upon reflection fairly legitimate with no questions or warnings that

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:02.980
you had to click through the link which I left untouched to enter personal information.

02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:05.780
Only the address it was sent from seemed suspect.

02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:11.420
Secondly I noticed the latest issue of Games Magazine July 2011 has a feature story on

02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:15.820
the selling of harmonics and the suspension of Guitar Hero as well as the reviewers take

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:18.340
on the Dead Space 2 ad controversy.

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:22.860
This is of course months old news, but to be fair, Games is not intended as a video

02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:23.860
game news source.

02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:28.800
It is first and foremost a magazine of crossword and logic puzzles with articles about board

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.620
games and within the last decade or so of video games as well with issues likely being

02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:35.460
put together months before being published.

02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:37.900
July issue arriving in late April.

02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:43.180
I enjoy games for what it is, but wonder about your take on the ultra casual gaming press.

02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:50.460
And this comes from Robert M. Um, I don't really pay attention to it so, I don't know.

02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:57.220
I finally stopped getting a lot of those news release emails, Zynga farted.

02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:58.860
You know, that type of thing.

02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:00.540
I kind of don't care.

02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:02.900
I mean, if I want to play-

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:08.220
It's so hard because I don't read a lot of that stuff, you know, and sometimes we're

02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:09.220
challenged with that.

02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:11.420
We have to put ourselves in other people's shoes.

02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:18.660
I always find it fascinating to kind of see how, not so much maybe the casual gaming press

02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:21.740
or whatever, but like the mass media quote unquote reports on gaming.

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:26.400
Like there was a local channel here that reported on the whole PlayStation Network breach because

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:28.620
it was the top story on the day that it happened.

02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:34.340
It let off the 11 o'clock news and they twisted it to turn into a parents need to be monitoring

02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:39.140
what their children do type of story, which yes, I understand they should, but it seemed

02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:41.620
like, I don't know, it got a little preachy to me.

02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:42.940
Like it wasn't really about the hack.

02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:46.960
It was more about parents watch what your kids do because these consoles in your living

02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:49.460
room are stealing credit cards when you're not looking.

02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:53.860
And I just felt like it didn't really represent the story, but I expect no less from the mass

02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:54.860
media.

02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:56.420
You know what I mean?

02:24:56.420 --> 02:25:02.200
So I guess that's my unsolicited take on it.

02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:06.500
By the way, completely random aside, but it totally ties into this email.

02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:14.380
I did get a last minute story submission and it has to do with speaking of kind of casual

02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:15.460
game news sites.

02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:16.460
I don't know.

02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:19.420
I don't really consider, especially after something that happened this week.

02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.300
I don't want to get into the details of it.

02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:22.300
Follow me on Twitter.

02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:23.680
There's my plug.

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:25.180
There's more on it there.

02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:29.800
But a certain website and UGO, I'll tell you, a big gaming website that I like to say this

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:34.300
week stands for Ignorant Gaming News, is merging with UGO apparently.

02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.940
That's Depurr Report.

02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:39.100
And it's going to spin off from Newscore.

02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:40.100
Yeah.

02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:45.180
So I guess they're going to merge and continue to publish worthless stories.

02:25:45.180 --> 02:25:47.700
Okay.

02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:50.180
So is it my turn?

02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:51.180
Yes.

02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:52.180
Sorry.

02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:53.180
Okay.

02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:54.180
Hello.

02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:57.060
I'm not going to read your first email, first or second email, but I'm going to tell you

02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:01.740
if you are going to pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:02.900
Apostrophes are for possessives.

02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:03.900
The end.

02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:04.900
Okay.

02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:05.900
Now I'll read it.

02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:06.900
Hello all.

02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:07.900
First of all, I have to say I'm loving the show.

02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:12.540
Second, I want to hear, I want to get Jamie her taco, so I thought I should write to you

02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:13.540
guys.

02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:14.540
My taco was delicious.

02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:15.540
Thank you.

02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:16.540
Here's my question.

02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.020
I'm a hardcore MMO player.

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:22.680
Blizzard has its firm grasp on my wallet for six years and I've recently dabbled a bit

02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:24.820
in playing Rift alongside WoW.

02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:28.420
The thing is, I think Rift made me want to play WoW again, and I always wondered why

02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:29.420
that was.

02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:30.420
Any ideas?

02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:33.420
Maybe because it made you really appreciate World of Warcraft?

02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:34.420
Maybe?

02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:37.180
Also, there are lots of new MMOs being released.

02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:41.340
Terra Online, which I like to call Chicks with Gigantic Boobs MMO.

02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:43.020
The Old Republic and The Secret World.

02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:44.020
Do I want to play them?

02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:45.020
Yes.

02:26:45.020 --> 02:26:47.780
I actually want to play all of them, but I know most will probably disappoint me.

02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:51.580
In reality, I'll probably just stick with the two MMOs, but yes, here's my real question.

02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:54.980
Finally, do you think it's possible to juggle two MMOs at the same time?

02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:58.620
Keep up the good show, and I hope that you get your tacos, Jamie.

02:26:58.620 --> 02:26:59.620
Love, Cyl.

02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:02.020
Hey, it was our guest from Hoard House this week.

02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:03.020
Yes.

02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:04.300
You know what?

02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:06.300
I feel bad now correcting.

02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:07.300
You bitch.

02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:09.020
No, I'm just kidding.

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.900
See, I said that was your role on the show.

02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.420
But I do that to everybody.

02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:13.420
So, much love.

02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:14.420
Okay.

02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:19.980
So, first of all, I actually want to go back and play Star Trek Online while I'm playing

02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:22.260
well, but I can't afford the two together right now.

02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:27.900
That's the hardest thing, is that trying to pay for two is usually the hardest thing to

02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:28.900
play two.

02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:34.040
I've seen a lot of people juggle a freemium in a premium, especially like Guild Wars types

02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:35.040
of things.

02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:36.040
That gets juggled a lot.

02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:40.620
Facebook games, if you think about it to some extent, are MMOs, kind of, I don't know.

02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:42.380
So can you?

02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:43.380
Of course you can.

02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:46.180
There's lots of people that play two MMOs at once.

02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:50.260
When I was on Star Trek Online, I played Ragnarok Online on a free server.

02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:53.420
So I was keeping up with two MMOs, no problem.

02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:56.300
I mean, most of the time it was just, oh, which one are my friends hanging out on?

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:57.620
Well, I'll go play this one right now.

02:27:57.620 --> 02:28:01.300
Okay, well, my guild's all asleep because I'm in America and they're not.

02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:08.180
So I suppose a lot of it just kind of depends too on how casual or hardcore are you into

02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.180
the games.

02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:12.620
Like, if you're hardcore into WoW, you don't have time for a lot else.

02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:17.940
If you're raiding several nights a week for several hours at a time, you're probably lucky

02:28:17.940 --> 02:28:20.220
if you're fitting in console games in your downtime.

02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:24.660
You know, you can't, your life can't be filled with video games 24-7 and I think, you know,

02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:27.660
obviously the stuff from earlier tonight kind of proves that.

02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:31.340
There's a whole real world out there with news and everything.

02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:37.180
You know, so, but if you're more of the casual type, you don't really tie yourself down to

02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:38.180
the games.

02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:42.140
You get to play on kind of like an as-you-want basis, absolutely there's room for two.

02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:43.140
Why not?

02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:48.460
Hell, some people invested like, what, a hundred hours plus into a game like Oblivion.

02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:50.900
That's almost as big of an investment as an MMO.

02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:55.700
Well, it's, I'll tell you what's kind of hard is I've been playing Portal 2 and WoW together.

02:28:55.700 --> 02:29:00.300
I mean, not at, clearly not at the same time, but I mean, both are time consuming, it really

02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:01.300
just depends.

02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:02.300
Next email.

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:07.340
Hey y'all, I was listening to OLR about the PSN network going down and the guy who was

02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:10.500
writing in thought that Anonymous did it.

02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.860
I personally don't think it was them because they said they had realized it wouldn't hurt

02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:17.620
the people they were trying to stand up for, which is a point that I made.

02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:21.500
It sounds to me like someone heard that Anonymous was doing this and decided to take advantage

02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:25.420
of having an obvious patsy and cover their own tracks.

02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:29.140
These guys seem to focus mainly on taking down websites and I've never heard of Anonymous

02:29:29.140 --> 02:29:31.020
actually stealing stuff.

02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:35.240
I mean, I guess it's possible, but it just doesn't sound right.

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:39.860
These are the same people who defended that Casey Heinz kid who was bullied.

02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:41.860
They sound like well-meaning folk.

02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:43.740
It just doesn't seem like them to me.

02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:47.500
Also about the hacking emails, I got one from Best Buy 2 saying that their email list had

02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:48.580
been stolen.

02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:50.900
It just seems to be going around right now and that's from Holly D.

02:29:50.900 --> 02:29:55.740
Wow, that's another Hoard House listener I recognize.

02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:59.040
Yeah, I don't know.

02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:03.380
It's going to be interesting to see, especially with so many people involved, what the effect

02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:07.780
on the hackers could be because at the end of the day, the hackers are the ones to blame,

02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:08.780
right?

02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:09.780
Yeah.

02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:13.940
Although Sony does share their part in the accountability.

02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:14.940
Yes.

02:30:14.940 --> 02:30:16.740
They had...

02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:20.460
Sony needs to show what they're really doing to stop the hackers other than, well, our

02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:24.040
system is hack proof, inviting them in the front door, you know?

02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.980
Don't talk out of your ass.

02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:28.940
Okay.

02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:33.100
If any, please answer in comments or e- what the hell is this?

02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:36.100
Oh no, this is crap email.

02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:37.100
Sorry.

02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:38.100
Oh, is it spam?

02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:39.100
Yeah.

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:44.020
Oh, we have one from Anime Jam Session podcast crew, which would be our buddy Ranma.

02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:45.020
Skip it.

02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:46.020
I'm just kidding.

02:30:46.020 --> 02:30:47.020
I'm kidding.

02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:50.140
Greetings one and all, DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session here.

02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:53.820
In between downtime and edits for the site and podcasting and everything else, I have

02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:55.340
found time to send an email.

02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:58.420
I do have something to discuss and I will get straight to the point.

02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:03.500
Rob, you squeaked with delight over the revival of the Commodore 64 and Loki thought it was

02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:04.500
crazy.

02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:05.500
I do have your back on this.

02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:11.740
I grew up with the C64, but instead of Tandy, Radio Shack, TRS-80, MC-10, and Color Computer

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:12.740
3 for me.

02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:14.980
I had one of those too.

02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:18.100
From reading the specs and design build of it, I can justify the cost, especially the

02:31:18.100 --> 02:31:19.100
ultimate.

02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:23.100
I can tell you right now that the parts alone would run about $300 to $350 and probably

02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:27.020
another $200 for the case itself, since it's going to be made from the original materials,

02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:30.420
not the soft, cheap plastic crap, so Loki, stop hatin'.

02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:31.420
That's it.

02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:32.420
Time for me to get back to work here.

02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:34.820
The monkeys are flinging their poo at me, duck.

02:31:34.820 --> 02:31:35.940
Take care and stay black.

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:37.860
Okay, now the joke is officially dead.

02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:41.820
This email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, a podcast dedicated to anime cons,

02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:44.580
conventions, pop culture, and everything in between.

02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:47.220
Guaranteed podcasts, derailing, or your money back.

02:31:47.220 --> 02:31:50.380
Check it out at www.animeshamsession.com.

02:31:50.380 --> 02:31:51.380
Also on iTunes.

02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:52.540
Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.

02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:55.860
Could you read that part again that says, to Loki, stop hating?

02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:57.840
Stop hatin'!

02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:00.880
That's why he's on the show, is to hate.

02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:03.240
He's our resident hater.

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:04.940
Hopefully he's playing Portal right now.

02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:06.580
Yeah, well, Portal sucks.

02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:07.820
Oh wait, no it doesn't.

02:32:07.820 --> 02:32:08.820
I got nothin'.

02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:13.140
Hey, O.L.R. crew, long time podcast listener, first time writer.

02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:16.600
There have been many times that I have almost written in to comment on this, but never really

02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:18.220
felt compelled to until now.

02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:19.580
My reason for writing is twofold.

02:32:19.580 --> 02:32:21.980
One, most importantly, free tacos for Dark Sakura.

02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:23.700
I love you.

02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:26.180
Hopefully this email will get to that magic number ten.

02:32:26.180 --> 02:32:28.180
You're up there on the list.

02:32:28.180 --> 02:32:29.780
Two, Rob, please say it loud the following.

02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:30.780
Okay, ready?

02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:33.740
Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery.

02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:37.060
Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery and give half to Rob.

02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:40.860
I'm requesting this because obviously Rob is a prophet given his prediction of the PSN

02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:43.540
outage being a bigger deal than initially reported.

02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:45.500
I was listening to the podcast last week.

02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:49.620
On the same day, Sony said, oh, and by the way, you know all that sensitive data we made

02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:52.260
you give us to play our games and use our services?

02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:56.700
Yeah, we just put a Furby on guard to watch security, and I guess the battery just ran

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:57.700
out.

02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:03.700
So, normally if anything was up, that little sumbitch would, that little sumbitch would

02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:10.980
start talking all kinds of crazy stuff like, mew, wow.

02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:13.420
But don't worry, everyone, we're going to put in a new battery.

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:18.660
In the meantime, just watch all your credit card info and change all your passwords.

02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:19.660
We cool, dog?

02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:21.240
Yeah, we cool.

02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:25.380
I'm sure this topic has been beaten into the ground, so you can leave it at that.

02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:27.560
Beards Whiskey and Rock and Roll, Beardy McWhiskey.

02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:28.560
I like Beardy McWhiskey.

02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.560
Is he Canadian?

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:34.820
I don't know, but I want him to send me some whiskey and send me the good stuff.

02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:35.820
Send me the beard.

02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:36.820
Just kidding.

02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:40.140
You would not be able to, Alan can rock the beard.

02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:41.140
Alan can rock the beard.

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:42.140
I don't think you can rock the beard.

02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:43.140
No, I can't rock the beard.

02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:44.140
You've got that baby face.

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.140
Aw.

02:33:45.140 --> 02:33:46.140
Aw.

02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:49.340
Then again, I didn't think Dan could rock a beard, but now he's got the goatee of doom.

02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:50.340
You don't know.

02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:53.340
One of these days I'm just going to shave my head and then I'll have the beard and we'll

02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:54.340
see what happens.

02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:55.340
That's too lumpy.

02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:57.900
But I'm not going to have a choice soon enough.

02:33:57.900 --> 02:34:00.460
You could totally pull a Shatner and get, like, the fake toupee.

02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:01.460
No, I'm not.

02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:02.460
We'll get you a Tribble!

02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:03.460
In hell.

02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:07.740
And then we can pop you on the head and go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:09.720
Rob Hearts.

02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:10.720
Next email.

02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:11.720
Okay.

02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:12.720
Hi O.L.R.

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:13.720
It's spaznator again.

02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:16.460
Yes, spaznator was one of the ones who sent me the big email from Sony, but this is the

02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:18.440
part of it that I'm going to read.

02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:19.440
Hi O.L.R.

02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:20.440
It's spaznator again.

02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:23.660
Sorry for the second email, but I have a question for you regarding the PSN press release from

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:24.660
4.30.

02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:28.660
The wording in one section has me a little confused. It states as follows.

02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:36.660
The company also expedited an already planned move of the system to a new data center in a different location that has been under construction and development for several months.

02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:46.660
In addition, PS3 will have a forced system software update that will require all registered PlayStation Network users to change their account passwords before being able to sign into the service.

02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:58.660
As an added layer of security, the passwords can only be changed on the same PS3 in which that account was activated or through validated email confirmation, a critical step to further protect customer data.

02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:11.660
When they say that the password can only be changed on the same PS3 in which the account was activated, do they mean the PS3 which you initially created the account or if you for the sake of this email are on your fourth PS3 and had previously successfully activated your account for the current PS3?

02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:23.660
Nope, the original one, but you'll be able to do it through email as well. If your original one died or whatever, you replaced it with a slim, whatever you did, you're not screwed as long as you can still log into the email account that you use for PlayStation Network.

02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:34.660
I ask this because I have two PSN accounts, spasnator and movie underscore profile, and neither account were initially created on my current PS3 although I've had these profiles on my PS3 since Sony sent it to me.

02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:46.660
With one profile, the email address is current, up to date, and easily accessible, but for the other, I still have the old Final Fantasy XI slash POL, I guess that's Play Online, email address associated with it.

02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:54.660
And I haven't used that in a couple of years. See, I'm both confused and concerned. Could you please enlighten me on this issue? Thank you in advance.

02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:58.660
I think you can actually still get into your Play Online email. You should be able to.

02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:07.660
Sony SOE was not affected. They went down for a little bit, but their information was fine, and that would include Play Online.

02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:20.660
Okay, well, we're almost done. Another one from Robert M. From what footage I've seen of Portal 2, how would you say it's fair to compare the ambiance to that of Bioshock? Haven't played either yet, but hope too soon.

02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:25.660
Bioshock is a little bit more doom and gloom, ominous?

02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:30.660
Bioshock strikes me as a little more steampunk, whereas Portal's just a little more...

02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:35.660
And it's a little bit more on the psychological horror. But Portal is the...

02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:39.660
It's definitely like Science Lab from old to new. I don't know how else to describe it.

02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:41.660
With that quirky humor.

02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:46.660
Bioshock, you know, keep in mind there's blood in Bioshock, and there's not in Portal, and it really does make a difference.

02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:48.660
Portal is really more of a puzzle game.

02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:51.660
Yes, you can die in Portal, but you don't die in, like, gruesome ways.

02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:53.660
No, more like you drown or get shot.

02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:54.660
Yeah.

02:36:54.660 --> 02:37:03.660
And if you think about it, Mario only, you know, he dies from drowning in water or falling off a cliff, you know.

02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:08.660
Characters die in games, but sometimes it's violent and sometimes it's not. So...

02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:10.660
That is finally it!

02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.660
That's it?

02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:13.660
Yarp.

02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.660
Alrighty.

02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:15.660
I read 11 emails.

02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:21.660
Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com. Send us more emails, give us things to talk about.

02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:26.660
Sorry, no food incentive for next week, but we'll think of something in the future. Maybe we'll have a special week.

02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:30.660
But this time, Darsaka's buying me something, okay? That's all I'm saying.

02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:36.660
I want tacos. I want Pinkberry. Send 10 emails so I can get Pinkberry. That's what I want.

02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:40.660
Of course, everybody knows tacos, but not everybody understands Pinkberry.

02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:43.660
Pinkberry's... Oh, wait, we got one last minute email.

02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:45.660
And it's short, so I'll read it.

02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:46.660
Okay, fine.

02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:52.660
Hey guys, I just wanted to chime in so Jamie could get some tacos. I did not get tacos. I got taco, but it was a big taco.

02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:56.660
That was her request, too. I asked her what she wanted and she said she wants a fish taco.

02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:57.660
Yes.

02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:58.660
Heh heh heh heh.

02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:00.660
Fish tacos are great.

02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:01.660
Heh heh heh heh.

02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:09.660
What is likely one of the main console developers would cease to exist and what is the likelihood new console developers could enter the market?

02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:15.660
Thanks guys for a great show as always. Hope Jamie gets tacos till her tummy explodes. I love your rants and very logical points of view, Loki.

02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:18.660
This message brought to you by typing on a PSP.

02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:21.660
Sucks! Thanks again, guys. Blade 3.

02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:24.660
Sorry, what was the question out of that, too? A console developer?

02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:29.660
What is the likelihood that a main console developer would cease to exist and what is the likelihood that a new console developer could come in?

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:33.660
Now, I'm gonna go back and use, um, Sega.

02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:35.660
Okay, we still have Sega.

02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:37.660
Or is it Sammy Sega now?

02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:42.660
But they did stop developing consoles.

02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:47.660
They're still around, but we don't have them as a console developer anymore.

02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:53.660
That's a really good question. Um, I don't think it's gonna happen right now.

02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:54.660
Coleco's gone.

02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:58.660
Well, yeah, no, and NEC did the TurboGrafx, right?

02:38:58.660 --> 02:38:59.660
Atari.

02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:00.660
But NEC is still around.

02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:03.660
Right, all these companies are still around, but they don't have consoles anymore.

02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:04.660
Yeah.

02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:12.660
Um, well, there's also, you could go minor. You could say Philips had the CDi, Apple had the Pippin.

02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:13.660
Magnavox.

02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:14.660
You know, none of these really made a splash, but they did exist.

02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:17.660
Um, eww, this is really hard.

02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:27.660
I think quite likely, because of the ones out now, the real newcomers would be Sony and Microsoft.

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:28.660
And Apple.

02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:29.660
And Apple.

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:36.660
I still say the i-blank is a gaming device, and that's kind of where, I don't know, a lot of portables going.

02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:45.660
Um, you know, the thing is, as far as someone exiting, despite the news we've been talking about this week,

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:49.660
when it comes to the pure sales, none of the systems have been doing terribly.

02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:51.660
None of them have tanked.

02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:52.660
No.

02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:58.660
And that's usually why a console, you know, why a company disappears, because they release a console that just tanks.

02:39:58.660 --> 02:39:59.660
And that really hasn't happened.

02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:00.660
But we really have our big three.

02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:01.660
Yeah.

02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:09.660
And two of our big three are newcomers within the last 15 years?

02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:11.660
PlayStation's about 15 years old, so yeah.

02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:12.660
Yeah.

02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:13.660
A little over 50.

02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:16.660
That came out in 94, or 95.

02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:28.660
But it was, Sony's additions, well, contributions to the console market, they did the SNES's sound processor.

02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:34.660
I just, I think it's too much for a fourth person to come in, but I think if it's going to be anyone, it's going to be Apple.

02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:42.660
I think they're going to try to sneak their stuff onto your TV through Apple TV and all this stuff, more so than they already have.

02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:45.660
And I don't think it's that Apple's really trying to get into gaming.

02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:49.660
Apple's just in it to make money.

02:40:49.660 --> 02:40:50.660
So we'll see.

02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:53.660
But as far as one of the other three going away, I don't think so.

02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:57.660
One of them's going to have to release a real stinker for that to happen.

02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:00.660
And I don't see any of them as particularly vulnerable right now.

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:10.660
But obviously if Nintendo's going a completely different direction with this console, could be a risky move, especially since 3DS didn't go up to expectations.

02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:12.660
But I don't think the 3DS is doing terribly.

02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:15.660
It's not doing enough where it's going to bankrupt the company.

02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:16.660
Yet, anyway.

02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:18.660
Well that was actually, I think, a really good email.

02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:22.660
Thank you for contributing.

02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:24.660
MegaBoyX in our chatroom says, screw Apple.

02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:26.660
I think that's what a lot of people say.

02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:29.660
I think you just mean facts are facts.

02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:33.660
iPhone, iPads, iPods, all that shit sells really well.

02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:35.660
And games are available on all of them.

02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:40.660
Enough so that Nintendo has had to comment on it and kind of dog the competition.

02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:43.660
So, they are a player.

02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:44.660
No.

02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:46.660
Alright, that's it for the email bag.

02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:48.660
Now is the part of the show where we're going to get ranty.

02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:50.660
It's the FUs of the week.

02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:51.660
Rawr.

02:41:51.660 --> 02:42:13.660
My FU goes towards my last week and finals week of school.

02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:17.660
I have a lot of work to get done and not that much time to get it done in.

02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:23.660
And my second FU goes towards my really weird bout of exhaustion slash insomnia

02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:29.660
that's been making me completely wiped out and kind of burned on everything going on.

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:31.660
So, I'll figure it out.

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:33.660
It's probably just end of school stress.

02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:34.660
Okay.

02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:35.660
Loki?

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:41.660
FU to the upcoming hot that's going to be coming this week.

02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:46.660
I mean, it's not hot as what we normally get.

02:42:46.660 --> 02:42:49.660
But it's going to get up to 85 degrees this week.

02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:51.660
And that's not that bad.

02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:55.660
But this time of year though, you know, 85 feels like 105.

02:42:55.660 --> 02:42:58.660
And then once we hit 105, we're begging for 85.

02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:01.660
But right now, it feels like 105.

02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:03.660
So, dammit.

02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:04.660
I hate being hot.

02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:06.660
I like being cold.

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:07.660
Cold is easy.

02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:08.660
Put more layers on.

02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:10.660
Hot, can't take more layers off.

02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:12.660
It only takes so many layers.

02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:14.660
My FU of the week, I don't know.

02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:15.660
Things have been pretty good actually.

02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:20.660
I'll just FU to me not usually getting enough sleep at night.

02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:22.660
I should stop doing that.

02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:24.660
Oh, FU to having to work on Saturday.

02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:28.660
That's definitely worthy of an FU because that's why I had to get up early on Saturday.

02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:30.660
Exactly.

02:43:30.660 --> 02:43:38.660
I actually was not forced to come in, but I just did it because when people ask me nicely,

02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:41.660
I tend to do nice things even though I might not really like them.

02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:42.660
All right.

02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:43.660
Moving on.

02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:46.660
Let's get into a couple more news stories.

02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:48.660
And then finally, the Skype line.

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:50.660
I expect it to be ringing off the hook tonight, but we'll see.

02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:51.660
All right.

02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:53.660
Let's get into some other news.

02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:54.660
Loki.

02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:55.660
Yes, this is kind of funny.

02:43:55.660 --> 02:43:59.660
It's one of the most annoying characters ever.

02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:03.660
Getting kind of a return in sort of a gaming form.

02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:10.660
Microsoft Office's Clippy is getting its own tutorial slash game.

02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:14.660
I guess Ribbon Hero 2 Clippy Second Chance.

02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:25.660
It's a video game slash tutorial to kind of walk you through some of the new features of Microsoft Office.

02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:28.660
It says, yes, we've turned Office into a game.

02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:33.660
If you're going to spend time immersed in the inner workings of Office, by golly, it should be fun.

02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:39.660
Discover new Office features by actually using them with hit button to fall back on in case you get stuck.

02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:42.660
Race for a high score with colleagues, classmates, and friends.

02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:47.660
You can put your high score on your resume to show off your Office skills.

02:44:47.660 --> 02:44:49.660
I don't recommend doing that.

02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:53.660
For those of you who have been paying attention, we've done this before.

02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:56.660
That's how we've got the two at the end of the title.

02:44:56.660 --> 02:44:58.660
So what's different?

02:44:58.660 --> 02:44:59.660
Clippy.

02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:04.660
Comic strips, colorful graphics, surprise animations, multiple levels, time travel, upside down.

02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:15.660
Clippy, spaceships, Greek gods, bow and arrow battles, and tons of useful Office features.

02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:18.660
Will it slow down your computer insanely too?

02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:21.660
That's what Clippy was always best for.

02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:24.660
Alright, moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.

02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:27.660
It's about a big, big PC game that's set to come out soon.

02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:29.660
Diablo 3.

02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:30.660
When is it coming out?

02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:33.660
Well, some are saying possibly 2011.

02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:36.660
I kind of hate news stories like this because it kind of seems obvious.

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:38.660
Well, it's either coming out this year or next.

02:45:38.660 --> 02:45:39.660
I mean, no shit.

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:41.660
But here's what's causing the speculation.

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:42.660
No, no, no, it should have been.

02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:44.660
It's either coming out this year or later.

02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:45.660
Yeah.

02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:46.660
Here's what's causing the speculation.

02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:50.660
The game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, said this to the New York Times.

02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:53.660
Quote, we're definitely in the home stretch.

02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:54.660
We're crunching.

02:45:54.660 --> 02:45:56.660
This is when the magic happens.

02:45:56.660 --> 02:45:58.660
But, I mean, for Blizzard?

02:45:58.660 --> 02:45:59.660
Shit.

02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:00.660
That could mean anything.

02:46:00.660 --> 02:46:01.660
I hope it's this year.

02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:03.660
I would love to be playing Diablo 3 by Christmas.

02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:06.660
I'm hoping BlizzCon will shed some light on that.

02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:09.660
Especially since they're not going to be releasing a WoW expansion this year.

02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:11.660
They may have a Starcraft 2 expansion.

02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:14.660
But otherwise, there's nothing for Blizzard to release this year.

02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:16.660
So I sort of hope it is Diablo 3.

02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:18.660
I would say it's got to release in the...

02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:20.660
Well, they have a new MMO they're working on.

02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:22.660
Yeah, but that's not coming out until, like, 2013.

02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:24.660
Doesn't mean they can't announce it.

02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:26.660
They can announce it, but it won't make them money.

02:46:26.660 --> 02:46:27.660
An announcement doesn't make you money.

02:46:27.660 --> 02:46:30.660
Well, that's not necessarily true there, no.

02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:34.660
Because an announcement at BlizzCon makes them money.

02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:36.660
Because people go to BlizzCon for those announcements.

02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:39.660
They could get up on stage and announce that they just pooped.

02:46:39.660 --> 02:46:43.660
And people would pay $175 to still go.

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.660
Because that's what BlizzCon's turned into.

02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:53.660
It's people paying to watch what they should be able to see at E3 on TV for free.

02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:56.660
And I love the Blizzard products.

02:46:56.660 --> 02:46:59.660
I just haven't loved them as much since Activision bought them.

02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:02.660
But anyway, if you want to know more about that, go listen to the other show.

02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:05.660
Meanwhile, let's get into the calls.

02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:07.660
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:09.660
or our username on Skype is OrangeLaundryAD.

02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:10.660
The phones are open.

02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:14.660
PSN, Xbox, whatever you want to talk about in the gaming world.

02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:15.660
Give us a call.

02:47:15.660 --> 02:47:17.660
We'll let you talk for a minute here.

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:18.660
Kaijuto in our chatroom says,

02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:20.660
I think Diablo 3 is going to be a letdown.

02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:21.660
I really hope not.

02:47:21.660 --> 02:47:24.660
Like, there's a part of me that doesn't want to argue with you.

02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:26.660
Because you might be right, but I just really hope not.

02:47:26.660 --> 02:47:27.660
I hope you're wrong.

02:47:27.660 --> 02:47:29.660
I think it won't be worth the development time.

02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:30.660
I'll put it that way.

02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:32.660
I mean, I don't know.

02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:34.660
Blizzard doesn't really seem to put out bad games, though.

02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:36.660
You know, Starcraft 2 is still really good.

02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:38.660
WoW has all been great.

02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:40.660
But then again, Cataclysm did have a lot of problems.

02:47:40.660 --> 02:47:43.660
It's been the weakest WoW expansion so far.

02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:46.660
It hasn't lived through its life expectancy yet.

02:47:46.660 --> 02:47:50.660
But so far, it has not WoWed people,

02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:55.660
ironic, across the spectrum that the other expansions have, I would say.

02:47:55.660 --> 02:47:57.660
S.J. in chat says,

02:47:57.660 --> 02:48:02.660
I have zero hopes that it's coming out till it's in my hands.

02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:03.660
Well, you may be waiting for a little while.

02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:04.660
We'll see.

02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:06.660
Anyway, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:07.660
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:08.660
Who's this?

02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:10.660
It's Deathwishing.

02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:12.660
Hey, Deathwishing, how are you?

02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:15.660
I'm pretty good.

02:48:15.660 --> 02:48:16.660
I have to comment.

02:48:16.660 --> 02:48:17.660
I'm full of patriotism.

02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:18.660
Yeah, I know.

02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:20.660
It's crazy what's going on in the world.

02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:21.660
But I have to comment on this.

02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:22.660
It's so much more important.

02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:24.660
I'm looking at your little Skype picture,

02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:26.660
which is very MySpace-y.

02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:27.660
Like, what is this?

02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:29.660
Are you taking a picture of yourself in the bathroom?

02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:31.660
Well, it's my senior year, right?

02:48:31.660 --> 02:48:35.660
And my barbershop quartet, we all went to Disneyland,

02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:37.660
and my friend bought a fox hat, so I had to take a picture of it.

02:48:37.660 --> 02:48:38.660
Oh, that's what you're wearing.

02:48:38.660 --> 02:48:39.660
I think it's a chick magnet.

02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:40.660
It's a chick magnet.

02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:41.660
All right, awesome.

02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:43.660
All right, well, what did you call in to talk about?

02:48:43.660 --> 02:48:46.660
PSN stuff.

02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:47.660
Okay.

02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:48.660
What are your thoughts?

02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:55.660
I guess PlayStation Network feels that they're obligated to give free stuff

02:48:55.660 --> 02:49:01.660
on a free service to all the whiny 4chan babies.

02:49:01.660 --> 02:49:05.660
So you don't think they should be giving anything at all?

02:49:05.660 --> 02:49:09.660
I only think they should be giving reimbursements to the people that pay

02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:12.660
for PlayStation Plus, you know, and the people that pay for services

02:49:12.660 --> 02:49:17.660
like DC Online and paying customers.

02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:22.660
Not like everyone gets free stuff because you all bitch,

02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:25.660
but we're going to say we're polite.

02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:29.660
It's, I don't know, it kind of ends in the fact that I can't play SOCOM before.

02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:30.660
Now, be honest.

02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:34.660
Now, see, usually that sort of reaction comes from what you would call

02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:36.660
a Sony fanboy, so be honest.

02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:39.660
Are you a Sony fanboy?

02:49:39.660 --> 02:49:45.660
I own all systems, but I really, I mean, I kind of like it

02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:48.660
because I can get PlayStation Plus for free now just to try it out,

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:52.660
but I guess I kind of am a Sony fanboy.

02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:54.660
All right, see, see, all right.

02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:57.660
Well, I mean, what did you think of all this, the hacking and all that?

02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:00.660
I mean, as a Sony fanboy, are you like, this could happen to anyone,

02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:03.660
or are you like, wow, maybe Sony kind of asked for this?

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:06.660
I first went, wow, holy shit, I can't believe this happened,

02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:09.660
and then after I saw, oh, we didn't have a crypt and stuff,

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:14.660
I kind of just went, Sony, you set yourself up to this, you morons.

02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:18.660
I mean, you would think a company with all this money, with services,

02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:21.660
you know, in this age of day that has a service where, okay,

02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:25.660
we have for the developers, we can buy all of each other's games

02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:28.660
off our PlayStation Network, but we're going to keep it on the same server

02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:31.660
because that's the smart thing to do.

02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:33.660
Oh, no, guys, we're hacked now, and guess what?

02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:36.660
Your credit card's out, and the whole thing with the way they work

02:50:36.660 --> 02:50:38.660
the information, that just pissed me off, too.

02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:43.660
It's like the United States, which I love.

02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:52.660
Yeah, so do you agree with what we were saying earlier in the show

02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:56.660
about Sony is just hard-headed?

02:50:56.660 --> 02:50:58.660
Very, very much so.

02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:01.660
Why is it?

02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:05.660
Is Sony just drunk with power from being from the rampant success

02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:08.660
of the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2?

02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:14.660
Well, yeah, I think so that. I think that what they're trying to,

02:51:14.660 --> 02:51:19.660
you know, they're too afraid of the $599 US dollar system being, like, compromised.

02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:21.660
You know?

02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:22.660
Right.

02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:26.660
What I'm talking about here, how it's like, oh, we have such an expensive system.

02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:29.660
Oh, shit, we fucked up.

02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:32.660
I think that whole not encrypting the data is going to be a real thing

02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:34.660
that comes back to bite him in the ass.

02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:37.660
I think if this thing does go to trial, that's going to be the piece of it.

02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:40.660
You saw the stock prices go down, right?

02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:43.660
Oh, well, of course. Of course their stock price is going to go down.

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:45.660
Yeah, it already bit them.

02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:46.660
Oh, yeah.

02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.660
Especially how much of big releases for them came out that week, too.

02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:53.660
Hence me buying, actually, one of those releases and not being able to play it.

02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:54.660
Yeah.

02:51:54.660 --> 02:51:56.660
Well, not being able to play it online, but still.

02:51:56.660 --> 02:51:58.660
What is going on with SOCOM right now?

02:51:58.660 --> 02:52:02.660
Does SOCOM even have a single player? It does, right?

02:52:02.660 --> 02:52:06.660
If you can call it that.

02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:10.660
Interesting question. I like this comment from bonds006 in the chat room.

02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:14.660
If any one of us was working in the higher ranks of Sony,

02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:18.660
would we do something different?

02:52:18.660 --> 02:52:22.660
I told, I mean, I was trying to get, if I was in the higher ranks,

02:52:22.660 --> 02:52:26.660
I would have ran up to the frickin' night key people in there

02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:29.660
and punched them all in the dick.

02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:31.660
Let me put it this way.

02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:36.660
Yes, if I were Kazurai, I would have promptly fired the person in IT

02:52:36.660 --> 02:52:38.660
and I would have announced to the world that that's what we did

02:52:38.660 --> 02:52:40.660
and that's what we're going to change.

02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:42.660
But, I don't know.

02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:45.660
That's, yeah, that's I think what I would have done, too.

02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:48.660
I don't know if I would have punched them in the dick, but maybe with words.

02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:51.660
Hey, hey, they had it coming.

02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:52.660
Yeah, I know.

02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:58.660
But Xbox fanboys, user service did go down for three weeks in 2007, too.

02:52:58.660 --> 02:52:59.660
Three weeks?

02:52:59.660 --> 02:53:01.660
I don't remember Xbox being down for three weeks.

02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:03.660
Three days, maybe.

02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:06.660
I had to do over like December like a shitload of people rushed online

02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:08.660
because they got their Xboxes.

02:53:08.660 --> 02:53:11.660
That was like three days. It was not three weeks.

02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:12.660
I think it was three weeks.

02:53:12.660 --> 02:53:13.660
No, I think you're wrong.

02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:16.660
It was like three days, three weeks of like getting the network back up fully running.

02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:20.660
If you want to get the Xbox fanboys, you need to go to the Red Ring of Death.

02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:22.660
But again, because that was terrible.

02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:26.660
However, Microsoft handled it much better than Sony's handling it so far.

02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:29.660
So, all right.

02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:30.660
True.

02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:31.660
Anyhow.

02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:33.660
It's all good in the tent. At least everything may have Prince money.

02:53:33.660 --> 02:53:36.660
All right, I got to let you guys, we can get more calls, and you're breaking up a little bit anyway.

02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:38.660
So, take care, buddy.

02:53:38.660 --> 02:53:39.660
Bye.

02:53:39.660 --> 02:53:42.660
All right, that was Death Wishing, ladies and gentlemen,

02:53:42.660 --> 02:53:45.660
who apparently sings in a barbershop quartet that once performed at Disneyland.

02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:47.660
I never knew.

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:48.660
The things we learn about the listeners.

02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:53.660
Maybe we need our listeners to tell us more secrets about themselves.

02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:55.660
That's what I'd like to hear from the listeners that call in tonight.

02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:57.660
We want to know something about you.

02:53:57.660 --> 02:53:58.660
Tell us the secret.

02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:02.660
Nobody would know this by looking at me.

02:54:02.660 --> 02:54:04.660
All right, let's go to the phones and get another call.

02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:05.660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:08.660
Who's this?

02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:10.660
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:10.660 --> 02:54:11.660
¿Quien es?

02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:12.660
Hello?

02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:14.660
Hi, who's this?

02:54:14.660 --> 02:54:15.660
Hey, can you hear me?

02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:16.660
Yes.

02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:17.660
Hi, who is this?

02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:19.660
I've got a bad echo.

02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:20.660
Uh-oh, that's a problem.

02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:21.660
Hold on a second.

02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:22.660
I'm sorry.

02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:24.660
I didn't expect you guys to pick up that quick.

02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:27.660
Sure, we'll hold.

02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:29.660
Can you hear us at all?

02:54:29.660 --> 02:54:30.660
Yeah, there we go.

02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:31.660
I had to kill my stream.

02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:32.660
That's all right.

02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:33.660
It happens.

02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:34.660
Yeah, yeah.

02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:35.660
First rule of calling into radio.

02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:36.660
Turn off your radio.

02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:37.660
All right.

02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:38.660
Who is this?

02:54:38.660 --> 02:54:39.660
Hey, this is Blue Swim.

02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:40.660
Hi, Blue Swim.

02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:44.660
All right, tell us something we wouldn't know by looking at you.

02:54:44.660 --> 02:54:51.660
Well, I'm a Spice Girls fan.

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:52.660
Awesome.

02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:53.660
Awesome.

02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:54.660
All right, great secret.

02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:55.660
All right.

02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:58.660
All right, what's on your mind tonight?

02:54:58.660 --> 02:55:01.660
Forgive me if you already touched on this.

02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:03.660
I was in and out of the room.

02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:04.660
Yeah, I know.

02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:06.660
There's a lot of news going on in the world.

02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:08.660
It's fine.

02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:16.660
Did you weigh in on the show about IGN's little fake or gay article?

02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:21.660
No, there was a part of me that didn't want to go there, but if the listeners want to

02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:22.660
go there, then fine.

02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:25.660
Why don't you do some reporting on this?

02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:28.660
Tell us a little bit about what happened and how you feel about it.

02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:40.660
Well, basically, IGN took the time to write a little article detailing the sexuality of

02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:44.660
Yoshi and Turok, of all people.

02:55:44.660 --> 02:55:54.660
Basically, they went through this whole long detailed article explaining that Yoshi is,

02:55:54.660 --> 02:56:00.660
I believe they used the phrase technically queer or something to that effect, because

02:56:00.660 --> 02:56:10.660
he is dating Birdo, who apparently is a transsexual, if I got the article right.

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:16.660
My browser's kind of going slow there for a minute.

02:56:16.660 --> 02:56:18.660
Yeah, so yeah.

02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:23.660
I was told on Twitter that the article was actually written by somebody who was gay,

02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:25.660
which makes it stranger.

02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:26.660
I don't know.

02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:27.660
It makes the whole thing weirder.

02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:32.660
But as I mentioned on Twitter, articles are written to generate hits, and that's one reason

02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:36.660
why I wouldn't link it for my Twitter, because I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.

02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:42.660
And I think these sorts of rampant speculation, it just adds fuel to all that stuff, and it's

02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:43.660
just unnecessary.

02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:50.660
If you want to write an interesting article about sexuality, why not talk about the impact

02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:51.660
of that?

02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:55.660
Or why are more games not putting it in their storylines?

02:56:55.660 --> 02:56:59.660
Or what is it that gay folks want in gaming?

02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:01.660
Maybe interview them.

02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:03.660
It's probably the same thing as everyone else, to be honest.

02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:04.660
I'll tell you that.

02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:06.660
I don't know, just an article like that just seemed so unnecessary.

02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:11.660
Or give us an article with a developer for Dragon Age, or one of the studios that actually

02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:15.660
put a gay character in the game, about how they did it, and how they made sure to address

02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:20.660
the sensitivity by making it realistic without being a joke.

02:57:20.660 --> 02:57:22.660
I don't know.

02:57:22.660 --> 02:57:27.660
Other than like, oh, Birdo's gay because of a misprint that was in an instruction manual

02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:29.660
so many years ago, because they used to rush the translation.

02:57:29.660 --> 02:57:30.660
I mean, it's stupid.

02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:34.660
But it actually has been official that Birdo is transgender.

02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:35.660
But still.

02:57:35.660 --> 02:57:39.660
Wasn't that confirmed in Captain Rainbow or something like that?

02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:44.660
That Nintendo Wii game that only came out in Japan several years ago?

02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:48.660
Also, there's plenty of folks that would argue that just because you date somebody who's

02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:50.660
transsexual doesn't make you one sexuality or another.

02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:53.660
I think some people just care too much about who's gay and who's straight.

02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:57.660
I think just love whoever you want to love and be over it, you know?

02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:59.660
That's just me.

02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:04.660
I'm all for equal rights.

02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:06.660
Well, what did you think when you read the article?

02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.660
Did it piss you off, or were you like, too many people were getting their panties ruffled

02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:12.660
over this?

02:58:12.660 --> 02:58:20.660
When I first saw on IGN's Twitter, when I first saw the title of this, I didn't even

02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:26.660
have to click on it before I'm thinking, what are they fucking doing?

02:58:26.660 --> 02:58:32.660
It just seemed like a desperate grab for hits.

02:58:32.660 --> 02:58:36.660
It was unnecessary.

02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:39.660
It just seemed like pure bullshit to me.

02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:45.660
It's not an article that they needed to write.

02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:49.660
It's not an editorial they needed to write.

02:58:49.660 --> 02:58:53.660
I'm looking at our chatroom here, and Makeup Boy X is in our chatroom saying,

02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:56.660
yeah, the guy on IGN came out as gay recently.

02:58:56.660 --> 02:58:58.660
He was just trying to write a fun article about it.

02:58:58.660 --> 02:59:03.660
I'm just kind of like, well, why not write an article about coming out as gay then in

02:59:03.660 --> 02:59:06.660
gaming culture?

02:59:06.660 --> 02:59:08.660
Is Yoshi gay?

02:59:08.660 --> 02:59:09.660
Is this so weird?

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:10.660
I don't know.

02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:11.660
It's unnecessary.

02:59:11.660 --> 02:59:12.660
It's unnecessary.

02:59:12.660 --> 02:59:15.660
That's, I think, the best thing I can think of to describe it.

02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:17.660
It was just unnecessary.

02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:24.660
Yeah, I know they were kind of joking about whether Yoshi was a man or a woman in Super

02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:33.660
Smash Brothers during Snake and Otacon's conversation before a fight with Yoshi.

02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:42.660
I remember them just bickering back and forth about, but he lays eggs, but it's a boy.

02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:43.660
Oh my gosh.

02:59:43.660 --> 02:59:45.660
All right, well, we've got to let you go to get some more calls.

02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:48.660
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:52.660
I just want to tell Defective Candy thank you for, I tell you what I want, what I really,

02:59:52.660 --> 02:59:54.660
really want over Twitter.

02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:55.660
All right.

02:59:55.660 --> 03:00:01.660
Well, I have one final thought for you along those lines.

03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:04.660
There you go.

03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:06.660
That's not Viva Forever.

03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:08.660
It's not Viva Forever.

03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:09.660
It's the song I happen to have up.

03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:10.660
All right.

03:00:10.660 --> 03:00:11.660
Have a go on Blue Swim.

03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:12.660
Take care, buddy.

03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:13.660
Thank you very much.

03:00:13.660 --> 03:00:14.660
You too.

03:00:14.660 --> 03:00:15.660
All right.

03:00:15.660 --> 03:00:16.660
1877 Game OLR.

03:00:16.660 --> 03:00:18.660
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:00:18.660 --> 03:00:21.660
Let me ask if there's any last minute stories.

03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:22.660
I guess I should check in with Loki.

03:00:22.660 --> 03:00:24.660
I hate to pull you from the portal.

03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:25.660
No, that's all right.

03:00:25.660 --> 03:00:26.660
All right.

03:00:26.660 --> 03:00:27.660
No, we do have some last minute stories.

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:32.660
Of course, there's, I don't know why you would buy in the collection now, maybe because Final

03:00:32.660 --> 03:00:34.660
Fantasy XIV is still broken.

03:00:34.660 --> 03:00:37.660
But Final Fantasy XI, if you happen to want to join that right now, there's actually a

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:39.660
good collection they have out there.

03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:45.660
They updated their ultimate collection now with the Ibiza edition, and it includes basically

03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:54.660
the game plus all the expansions plus the extra Ibiza, I guess, expansions.

03:00:54.660 --> 03:00:58.660
There are three add-on scenarios, all for 20 bucks.

03:00:58.660 --> 03:01:01.660
Okay, Loki, I want you to point at me and get ready to laugh.

03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:02.660
Yeah.

03:01:02.660 --> 03:01:08.660
Because I kind of want to go back and play, just for a couple weeks, just to relive old

03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:10.660
times, like revisiting an old friend.

03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:16.660
And then on top of that, you do get a special beret that I guess will increase skill gain,

03:01:16.660 --> 03:01:21.660
extra movement speed, and both magic and health regeneration.

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:26.660
And that's, I guess the new edition will be available to download May 16th.

03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:28.660
That's kind of cool.

03:01:28.660 --> 03:01:37.660
I want to, it's just a small part of me that kind of wants to go, just go hug an old friend.

03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:44.660
And then there's rumor that Ocarina of Time 3D is going to be a limited initial release.

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.660
Why?

03:01:45.660 --> 03:01:53.660
I mean, other than them being disappointed about the 3DS launch numbers, why would you

03:01:53.660 --> 03:01:55.660
do that?

03:01:55.660 --> 03:02:00.660
Make it extremely small so that people are trying to find it?

03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:02.660
See, Nintendo toys with their customers like that.

03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:04.660
That's the type of company they are.

03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:05.660
Awesome.

03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:09.660
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll free up one extra copy for those people looking for it,

03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:14.660
because I'm not buying it.

03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:19.660
And last but not least, if you don't like Madden, yet you still want a football game,

03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:24.660
All Pro Football 2K8, they have released, there's an editor that's been released for

03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:29.660
it, for the Xbox 360 version, using some file editing.

03:02:29.660 --> 03:02:33.660
And this can be done on non-modded consoles, by the way.

03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:41.660
You can actually update your rosters, you can also create custom teams, I guess adjusting

03:02:41.660 --> 03:02:50.660
stats and players and all that stuff, ratings, abilities, physical appearance, and basically

03:02:50.660 --> 03:02:57.660
create your own teams if you want, or base them off of the actual NFL teams.

03:02:57.660 --> 03:03:03.660
And I'm sure All Pro Football 2K8 is probably dirt cheap nowadays.

03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:08.660
So if you're interested in that, check out operationsports.com, they had a feature running

03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:15.660
on it, it's Flying Finn releases All Pro Football 2K8 editor.

03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:16.660
That's it.

03:03:16.660 --> 03:03:17.660
That's it.

03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:21.660
Alright, again, I'll give the number one more time, 1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype

03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:26.660
is Orange Lounge Radio, I know probably not a lot of people want to call in at this point,

03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:29.660
I thought it was going to be a busy phone line tonight, but probably just too many people

03:03:29.660 --> 03:03:33.660
distracted with other things going on in the world, and I guess I can understand that.

03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:40.660
But one more time, 1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:45.660
So, what do we talk about for a few more minutes while we wait for the phones to ring?

03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:48.660
This is such a funny image.

03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:49.660
Oh, one of the...

03:03:49.660 --> 03:03:53.660
Yeah, someone finally did like a little image of Obama, it says, sorry it took so long to

03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:57.660
get you a copy of my birth certificate, I was too busy killing Osama Bin Laden.

03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:58.660
That's funny.

03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:01.660
I don't know, I don't know.

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:05.660
I don't want to, I have things I want to say, but I don't want to get too political on the

03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:12.660
show, but I'm just, I just hope that this will be the first step in this all being over.

03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:15.660
So, that's all I'll say on that.

03:04:15.660 --> 03:04:20.660
Alright, well, I guess that's it, we're done.

03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:22.660
We're going to go ahead and close up the lines.

03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:26.660
It is, it's got, it's 1230 on the east coast anyway, so we're done.

03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:29.660
Let's go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:34.660
But first, let me also say this, if you liked Orange Lounge Radio, if you like the show

03:04:34.660 --> 03:04:37.660
here, do help spread the word about the show.

03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:40.660
Tell a friend or, you know, a nice five star review on iTunes is great too.

03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:43.660
There's been some really nice ones written in the past couple days, really appreciate

03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:44.660
it you guys.

03:04:44.660 --> 03:04:47.660
I do read them and they make me smile, so thank you guys very much for those that leave

03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:48.660
those.

03:04:48.660 --> 03:04:49.660
Really appreciate it.

03:04:49.660 --> 03:04:51.660
So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:53.660
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

03:04:53.660 --> 03:04:55.660
We.

03:04:55.660 --> 03:04:57.660
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:04:57.660 --> 03:04:59.660
Portal 2 is pretty awesome.

03:04:59.660 --> 03:05:02.660
Chapter 2, getting into it.

03:05:02.660 --> 03:05:06.660
My final thought is ice cream.

03:05:06.660 --> 03:05:07.660
What?

03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:08.660
I know.

03:05:08.660 --> 03:05:10.660
There's Baskin Robbins around the corner.

03:05:10.660 --> 03:05:13.660
I know, but they'll be closed by the time we're done with Afterbirth and all that.

03:05:13.660 --> 03:05:14.660
Alright, that's it guys.

03:05:14.660 --> 03:05:16.660
Thank you so much for listening to the show.

03:05:16.660 --> 03:05:20.660
Let's hope that PSN comes back in the next week and maybe we'll forget about it by next

03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:21.660
week.

03:05:21.660 --> 03:05:22.660
Likely not.

03:05:22.660 --> 03:05:25.660
But all the latest in gaming news and all that good stuff and your voices.

03:05:25.660 --> 03:05:27.660
Once again, same bat time, same bat channel.

03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:28.660
We'll see you next week.

03:05:28.660 --> 03:05:29.660
Thanks everybody.

03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:32.660
