00:13.883 --> 00:18.545
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, May 1st, 2011, the PlayStation Network remains down after an entire week.

00:18.865 --> 00:23.887
[SPEAKER_00]: Portal 2 plans free DLC, and Nintendo plans a free game from the 3DS shop.

00:31.909 --> 00:38.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.154 --> 00:46.018
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live with episode number 411, the 411 if you will, on this May the 1st of 2011.

00:47.239 --> 00:52.883
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, with me as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:53.641 --> 00:55.061
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not put you in a potato.

00:55.982 --> 00:56.322
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

00:56.382 --> 00:57.262
[SPEAKER_06]: And feed you two birds.

00:57.382 --> 00:57.962
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

00:58.383 --> 01:04.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's kind of funny because I was at Trader Joe's today, which, by the way, super crowded grocery store today.

01:04.785 --> 01:05.845
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a madhouse.

01:06.285 --> 01:08.726
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was some hash browns that were on sale.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.687
[SPEAKER_04]: And the little label on it says, when I grow up, I want to be hash browns.

01:12.747 --> 01:15.128
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't help but think of the same thing.

01:15.548 --> 01:16.449
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow.

01:17.269 --> 01:19.149
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave inadvertent spoilers today.

01:19.269 --> 01:19.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.891
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one she was spoiling, of course, was the one and only Techmaster, Loki!

01:24.472 --> 01:25.652
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked, so it's alright.

01:25.692 --> 01:26.312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, yeah.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep the show spoiler-free, guys, don't worry about it.

01:28.253 --> 01:28.794
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Loki?

01:29.134 --> 01:29.734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

01:30.074 --> 01:31.115
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, long time no see.

01:31.135 --> 01:41.119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little while, because we were off for, uh, two weeks ago, and then last week, Easter week, you were, you were like, oh, I gotta do family stuff, because I have a baby now, and so family stuff's important, so whatever, Loki.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.140
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

01:42.840 --> 01:43.261
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?

01:43.581 --> 01:44.082
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going alright.

01:44.383 --> 01:45.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

01:45.444 --> 01:48.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting going on with the baby and that whole stuff?

01:49.089 --> 01:53.275
[SPEAKER_03]: He's scooting forward now, which means he'll be crawling hopefully soon.

01:53.876 --> 01:54.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

01:55.217 --> 01:56.119
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the video.

01:56.519 --> 01:57.641
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks so proud of himself.

01:58.095 --> 01:59.215
[SPEAKER_03]: He is very proud of himself.

01:59.235 --> 02:01.776
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I can move!

02:02.536 --> 02:03.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait till I start walking!

02:04.236 --> 02:08.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Today he learned how to smack Mommy in the face when she's not listening.

02:08.657 --> 02:09.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Gave her a bloody nose.

02:10.077 --> 02:12.078
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

02:13.078 --> 02:14.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

02:14.238 --> 02:17.439
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets excited sometimes and he flails around.

02:18.119 --> 02:19.739
[SPEAKER_03]: He still doesn't have fine motor control.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever's holding him is subjected to the brunt of his attack.

02:25.261 --> 02:26.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Has he tugged on your face?

02:27.484 --> 02:28.823
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he does it all the time.

02:31.545 --> 02:31.905
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:31.985 --> 02:37.206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to start off the show, of course, with how was your gaming week and the video games you've been playing this week.

02:37.266 --> 02:40.267
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to, of course, introduce the chat room because they're always there with us.

02:40.647 --> 02:46.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night where gamers seem to be very opinionated this week.

02:46.448 --> 02:52.989
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't possibly imagine what could possibly have so many people with so many polarizing opinions.

02:53.089 --> 02:58.510
[SPEAKER_04]: It couldn't be that we're on day 11 of a certain network being down, which is certainly the longest.

02:58.890 --> 02:59.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

02:59.431 --> 03:00.231
[SPEAKER_03]: UPN's down?

03:01.591 --> 03:15.537
[SPEAKER_04]: UPN merged with Warner Brothers years ago All that aside, we'll get into that But first, a little lighter fare How was your gaming week and what games have you been playing this week?

03:15.577 --> 03:15.997
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

03:16.638 --> 03:17.698
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing a lot of stuff.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.240
[SPEAKER_06]: I played DDR on Wednesday.

03:21.340 --> 03:24.901
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza, which was actually pretty good.

03:26.042 --> 03:28.843
[SPEAKER_06]: So I cannot call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza anymore.

03:29.303 --> 03:36.306
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Julian's fourth birthday, and so we did the twister and everything, and he was a big boy and went on that.

03:36.406 --> 03:37.926
[SPEAKER_04]: John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

03:38.466 --> 03:39.567
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually pretty good.

03:39.847 --> 03:40.827
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually really good.

03:40.887 --> 03:41.988
[SPEAKER_06]: They're afraid of pizza.

03:42.008 --> 03:42.888
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty good.

03:43.288 --> 03:44.849
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has it been since you've had pizza?

03:46.812 --> 03:47.653
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty good.

03:48.173 --> 03:48.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

03:48.694 --> 03:51.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I managed to get those both when they were fresh, the pizzas I had.

03:52.357 --> 03:56.720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a pizza snob and I think their pizza's terrible, but that's because I haven't had it in a while.

03:56.740 --> 03:57.221
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

03:57.301 --> 03:59.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I like the macaroni and cheese pizza.

03:59.843 --> 04:03.306
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, speaking of food, would you please tell the listeners what you had before the show tonight?

04:04.093 --> 04:05.574
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a fish taco.

04:06.294 --> 04:08.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Rob, for my taco.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.497
[SPEAKER_06]: And damn it, people, I asked for more than 10, not more than 30.

04:13.578 --> 04:20.181
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, if you have no idea why DarkSakura was rewarded with a taco earlier tonight, you have to listen to last week's show.

04:20.281 --> 04:22.782
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like that I completely bullshitted you into getting me a taco.

04:22.802 --> 04:24.903
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of fucked up.

04:25.004 --> 04:26.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time I want something.

04:26.544 --> 04:26.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

04:27.005 --> 04:27.205
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

04:28.045 --> 04:29.806
[SPEAKER_06]: How about after the show I get you Pinkberry?

04:30.390 --> 04:34.252
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing if I didn't have work in the morning and I already foresee this show running long.

04:34.612 --> 04:36.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about after my finals are done?

04:37.094 --> 04:37.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

04:37.534 --> 04:38.574
[SPEAKER_06]: We go celebrate at Pinkberry.

04:38.835 --> 04:39.935
[SPEAKER_04]: That works for me.

04:39.995 --> 04:40.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, back to games.

04:40.996 --> 04:41.776
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll buy Alan some too.

04:42.557 --> 04:55.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I played some Ditter and I played this percussion master game that's supposed to be like Taiko no Tatsujin only it's a lot different and kind of sucky and had really bad covers of songs in there but I had fun playing it.

04:56.244 --> 05:03.727
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I played Afterburner Climax in the arcade because it's the only arcade machine I've seen and I love that game.

05:04.007 --> 05:04.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it make you climax?

05:07.309 --> 05:08.109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I was moist.

05:08.309 --> 05:15.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I just got done playing DDR.

05:16.612 --> 05:22.235
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got Portal 2 which I got two days ago.

05:22.695 --> 05:25.636
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it Friday night and I'm already almost caught up with you

05:27.216 --> 05:28.357
[SPEAKER_06]: because I had bad insomnia.

05:29.337 --> 05:40.565
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem is that I'm only playing it on Steam because, you know, I'm kind of glad I don't have the PlayStation 1 because of certain malfunctions.

05:40.665 --> 05:42.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me while I clean something up off the floor.

05:45.251 --> 05:51.035
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and cause you know, I honestly wouldn't have played it on the console anyway, so I'm really digging playing it on Steam.

05:51.695 --> 06:02.522
[SPEAKER_06]: I play with a trackball mouse, which I'm having a good time, but yeah, I have just found, well, it's a little bit of a spoiler, but I don't care, I'll say it anyway, I found Potatoes.

06:04.343 --> 06:07.065
[SPEAKER_06]: As they refer to her on the Half-Life wiki as Potatoes.

06:08.225 --> 06:09.746
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's been pretty cool.

06:10.947 --> 06:14.129
[SPEAKER_06]: You've heard me bitching about puzzles that make me violently ill.

06:15.393 --> 06:17.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's my husband, I think.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.483
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a visitor.

06:18.864 --> 06:19.607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a friend.

06:20.590 --> 06:21.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so...

06:25.462 --> 06:28.844
[SPEAKER_06]: I also, crap, what else did I play?

06:29.845 --> 06:32.846
[SPEAKER_06]: I played some Dragon Age, but I'm kind of forgetting about Dragon Age for now.

06:32.866 --> 06:38.709
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go ahead and give it back, because I've got Portal, although I'm probably going to end up having it beaten in the next couple days.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.631
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got level 60 for Rebecca Black.

06:42.572 --> 06:42.952
[SPEAKER_04]: On WoW?

06:43.192 --> 06:43.472
[SPEAKER_04]: On WoW.

06:43.592 --> 06:44.112
[SPEAKER_04]: World of Warcraft.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.734
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have to play co-op, because co-op's a lot of fun, too.

06:47.725 --> 06:49.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-op, well... No, co-op.

06:49.586 --> 06:50.226
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal, dummy.

06:50.786 --> 06:51.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't call me dummy, dummy.

06:53.487 --> 06:54.527
[SPEAKER_06]: I booted Darwinia.

06:56.768 --> 06:57.428
[SPEAKER_06]: But Portal.

06:58.229 --> 07:01.310
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of like... It's pretty.

07:01.790 --> 07:02.870
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is pretty.

07:02.950 --> 07:09.113
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been taking tons of screen captures because my favorite thing in this game so far are the work posters.

07:11.734 --> 07:37.605
[SPEAKER_06]: but for me being a big graphic design nerd I love how perfectly they capture the styles of each era the further along that you're in the facility like the stuff from the 40s and 50s and then the 60s style logo and as you move up through the facility and you come to the modern age they really did capture the design of those different eras really nicely

07:38.545 --> 07:40.567
[SPEAKER_06]: and I love the allergen poster.

07:41.468 --> 07:42.909
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, know your allergens.

07:43.370 --> 07:49.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen, pet dander, plastic, anti-matter.

07:50.816 --> 07:54.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Please let us know if you see anyone from the FDA, the FHA.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.861
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of great little jokes just in the artwork.

07:57.921 --> 08:04.705
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, part of what makes this game so phenomenal is that, you know, there's just, you can just be kind of walking around looking at the scenery.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.186
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just the, you know, very similar to the first game.

08:08.206 --> 08:10.607
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how there were like the cave drawing type of things?

08:11.028 --> 08:11.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Which are still there.

08:11.828 --> 08:12.388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're there.

08:12.969 --> 08:16.930
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're not totally throughout, but you find them in certain places.

08:16.950 --> 08:17.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know why?

08:17.351 --> 08:18.611
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the signs or jokes do.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.712
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why they're not fully through there?

08:20.892 --> 08:21.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me without spoiling?

08:22.313 --> 08:24.074
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll read the Lab Rat comic.

08:24.534 --> 08:28.375
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a comic that ties Portal to Portal 2 called Lab Rat.

08:28.415 --> 08:29.275
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a free PDF.

08:29.595 --> 08:31.856
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it on the Valve website.

08:32.716 --> 08:40.718
[SPEAKER_06]: And it talks about Ratman, who was the guy that was living in the facilities, hiding, and he apparently was a scientist.

08:41.238 --> 08:44.439
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's the reason that Chella's the one being tested.

08:44.999 --> 08:50.241
[SPEAKER_06]: Because while she wasn't the smartest or the most athletic, she had the most tenacity.

08:51.521 --> 08:53.363
[SPEAKER_06]: and it says on her, never ever gives up.

08:53.943 --> 08:58.728
[SPEAKER_06]: So she was initially rejected as a test subject and he moved her forward.

08:58.748 --> 08:59.608
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is all in the comic.

08:59.708 --> 09:00.209
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all in the comic.

09:00.229 --> 09:01.570
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just spoiling the comic, not the game.

09:02.130 --> 09:03.492
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's more to it.

09:04.152 --> 09:10.818
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there's a lot more to Ratman and there's a lot more to her and just different stuff that goes on in there.

09:10.838 --> 09:19.385
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's actually pretty, it's a good little tie-in and also if you haven't seen the restored ending for Portal, that ties in as well.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into our chatroom and chat.

09:22.221 --> 09:23.161
[SPEAKER_04]: Orangelandradio.com.

09:23.201 --> 09:24.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Defective Candy is sad.

09:24.441 --> 09:24.881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm poor.

09:25.021 --> 09:25.982
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't buy Portal.

09:26.762 --> 09:27.802
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably not alone.

09:28.162 --> 09:31.403
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's inevitable there will be a huge sale on Steam at some point.

09:31.443 --> 09:35.124
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would anticipate it's probably going to be around the time the first batch of download content comes out.

09:35.524 --> 09:38.725
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be, you know, hey, are you still not on Portal?

09:38.925 --> 09:39.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it now.

09:39.505 --> 09:39.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Half off.

09:39.986 --> 09:41.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Valve likes to do ridiculous sales.

09:41.966 --> 09:42.386
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.

09:42.826 --> 09:43.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal's $10 right now.

09:44.287 --> 09:45.807
[SPEAKER_04]: The only... Well, I mean Portal 2.

09:45.867 --> 09:46.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Portal 2, yeah.

09:47.228 --> 09:48.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, everybody can...

09:49.368 --> 10:03.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watch their retail stores because they're doing POS back-end rebates for retailers through now and I think June or the end of June.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.036
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marking it down to $30 or $40.

10:06.076 --> 10:08.257
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a POS back-end?

10:10.138 --> 10:14.943
[SPEAKER_03]: POS back end rebate means point of sale so basically they get it for cheaper.

10:15.463 --> 10:22.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one they sell, they track how many they sell and they get a rebate from the publisher for it.

10:22.250 --> 10:26.714
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an incentive to get them to bring in more product because they get to sell it for cheaper.

10:28.556 --> 10:31.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Just sort of like buying mass, like buying bulk, right?

10:31.238 --> 10:31.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sort of.

10:32.059 --> 10:39.864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happened with the five retailers that had the Wii systems for $170, because that wasn't offered to everybody.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.727
[SPEAKER_03]: That was only the top five direct retailers got offered that.

10:43.767 --> 10:49.512
[SPEAKER_03]: But with Portal 2, it's a little bit flexible, so they're getting a week where they get the market down.

10:49.552 --> 10:54.996
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to see a bunch of different retailers marketing down different weeks from now to the end of June.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw says, let's not forget about Cave Johnson.

10:58.340 --> 10:59.522
[SPEAKER_04]: He has some of the funniest stuff.

10:59.842 --> 11:00.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love him.

11:00.803 --> 11:05.630
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't realize it at first, but it's the dude that played J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man movies.

11:05.670 --> 11:06.271
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's perfect.

11:07.172 --> 11:10.837
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love Carolyn, which I won't say anything more about her.

11:12.279 --> 11:12.499
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

11:14.181 --> 11:17.063
[SPEAKER_06]: I, but it's, it's, I knew right away it was the same voice actor.

11:17.604 --> 11:22.347
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I, I, I love her speaking voice, but I love listening to her sing.

11:22.928 --> 11:28.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, not just the Jonathan Colton songs, but singing like she actually did the, the opera.

11:29.153 --> 11:29.993
[SPEAKER_06]: She's an operatic singer.

11:30.133 --> 11:33.976
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually gone back and listened to her sing other stuff and her voice is astounding.

11:34.337 --> 11:35.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really gorgeous.

11:35.618 --> 11:35.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

11:37.319 --> 11:41.064
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so really most of my time has been taken up with Portal 2.

11:41.885 --> 11:47.751
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been, for all of my motion sickness, I have been breezing through it.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.314
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the parts that I scream and yell at.

11:51.155 --> 11:52.056
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I threw up!

11:52.116 --> 11:53.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just started Chapter 7.

12:12.256 --> 12:14.357
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a few stages away from that, really.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.159
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally digging it.

12:18.479 --> 12:23.221
[SPEAKER_06]: The last fight, though, I'm not going to spoil it, because I did actually watch playthroughs a few times.

12:23.641 --> 12:27.883
[SPEAKER_06]: The last fight looks freaking difficult, but fun, too, at the same time.

12:28.143 --> 12:29.104
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to that.

12:29.624 --> 12:29.904
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

12:30.704 --> 12:35.026
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that does it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, then let's go to Loki and ask, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?

12:36.607 --> 12:38.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't play a lot of anything, actually.

12:38.588 --> 12:40.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Grand Theft Auto, really, because I've been playing...

12:41.616 --> 12:44.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been editing stuff in Grand Theft Auto.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've really been doing the last two weeks.

12:47.638 --> 12:50.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did play a few other small things.

12:50.499 --> 12:58.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Just mainly played a little bit of Unpleasant Horse, which is the new iOS game from PopCap.

12:58.561 --> 13:02.382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their kind of spin-off company that's doing it.

13:03.022 --> 13:05.985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because I don't know if there's more of these types of games coming.

13:06.065 --> 13:06.746
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are.

13:07.587 --> 13:23.642
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free, but the premise of the game, the way they came up with it, is they had a hat with a bunch of random names in it, just different parts of a name, and so they pull out the name for the game, and they have 48 hours to complete coding the game.

13:25.343 --> 13:47.041
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the premise of Unpleasant Horse is you're this unpleasant looking unicorn fat chubby horse and you fly around or hop from cloud to cloud trying to land on happy white unicorn horses or whatever Pegasus is, I guess, and you crush them and make them fall into meat grinders.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.361
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, and it's hilarious.

13:52.022 --> 13:54.926
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, definitely worth checking out since it's free.

13:56.327 --> 13:58.730
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fun, especially if you like horse violence.

14:00.892 --> 14:01.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I do.

14:02.594 --> 14:03.175
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it?

14:03.756 --> 14:06.799
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we covered, was it Fourth Battery?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.362
[SPEAKER_06]: We covered that on the show a few weeks ago.

14:09.562 --> 14:09.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, yeah.

14:09.943 --> 14:13.511
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember the story about how it took a little while for them to get on the store, but yeah.

14:14.012 --> 14:15.856
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even realize the game had actually come out.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Last I'd heard, it had been delayed, so that's cool.

14:18.962 --> 14:19.203
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

14:21.772 --> 14:22.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what else?

14:22.613 --> 14:30.879
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a really cool, actually, just real quick, there was a really cool story in the, I was making the rounds on the blogs this week, and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'll mention it here.

14:31.100 --> 14:35.923
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear that PopCap designed some game as part of a Make-A-Wish thing for a nine-year-old.

14:35.963 --> 14:36.904
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was very cool.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's up there now, too.

14:38.305 --> 14:39.526
[SPEAKER_04]: That game's up in the iOS store, too.

14:39.666 --> 14:40.167
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very cool.

14:41.028 --> 14:42.169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of other stuff.

14:42.449 --> 14:50.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was going to mod my laptop because these wonderful Asus laptops are not meant for proper cooling.

14:51.218 --> 14:57.805
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm modding the back of it so I can play some more graphic intensive games without feeling like my lap is on fire.

14:59.627 --> 15:00.789
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's see.

15:00.949 --> 15:01.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than gaming...

15:02.350 --> 15:12.638
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned a few weeks back and this is really hilarious how I was taking a test or whatever to get into Mensa well I passed that test so I'm in Mensa now

15:13.755 --> 15:14.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

15:15.276 --> 15:16.036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to say.

15:16.936 --> 15:17.716
[SPEAKER_04]: So now what?

15:17.837 --> 15:19.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what do you do as a Mensa member?

15:19.297 --> 15:21.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to be your thing now, your little M.O.

15:22.058 --> 15:22.578
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show?

15:23.178 --> 15:26.800
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Rob, as a member of Mensa, I think my opinion matters here.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.300
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to tell you.

15:28.320 --> 15:28.800
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing.

15:28.860 --> 15:30.701
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want the plaque or whatever.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on your resume, right?

15:32.102 --> 15:32.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're wondering.

15:32.662 --> 15:33.522
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang it up in your office.

15:33.542 --> 15:34.322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically it.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.523
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

15:35.543 --> 15:35.923
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

15:36.023 --> 15:39.024
[SPEAKER_03]: I can attend a seminar if I want to or something, but.

15:39.485 --> 15:40.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Go hang out with all the smart people.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.987
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is I can analyze games.

15:43.488 --> 15:46.550
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your midst of the placard, fucking Michael Pachter?

15:47.070 --> 15:47.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

15:47.711 --> 15:48.651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you have one.

15:49.392 --> 15:51.053
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my opinion means a little bit more than yours.

15:53.886 --> 15:54.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

15:55.927 --> 15:59.950
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, you need to go to one of these Mensa conventions, and I want to see some Mensa hotties.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Mensa hotties?

16:01.851 --> 16:03.713
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see a blog of Mensa hotties.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.874
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be all looking like librarians, I bet.

16:06.815 --> 16:08.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a stereotype, DarkSakura.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.097
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a stereotype.

16:10.117 --> 16:11.138
[SPEAKER_04]: Vicious stereotype.

16:11.158 --> 16:12.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Loki look like a librarian?

16:12.739 --> 16:13.459
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't look like a librarian.

16:13.479 --> 16:15.701
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about the women, but okay.

16:15.741 --> 16:16.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Librarians are hot, though.

16:17.342 --> 16:21.104
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just, I just, I don't even know why I took the test.

16:21.304 --> 16:23.486
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah Palin was kind of hot until she opened her mouth.

16:25.026 --> 16:25.247
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

16:26.207 --> 16:27.107
[SPEAKER_03]: That all depends.

16:27.127 --> 16:29.048
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, your opinion of Sarah Palin.

16:29.088 --> 16:36.110
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it might be even hotter if she opened her mouth, but... And when she started talking, though, then that just went downhill.

16:37.251 --> 16:38.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like them stupid, I guess.

16:39.392 --> 16:40.372
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

16:40.412 --> 16:41.152
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was funny.

16:42.012 --> 16:42.313
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

16:42.773 --> 16:43.093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that's it for your Gaming Week, then I'll talk about my Gaming Week.

16:46.534 --> 16:48.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I just did a... Sorry, sorry.

16:48.715 --> 16:50.135
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did a Street Pass thing with Rob.

16:50.155 --> 16:51.896
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I actually have two me's on my...

16:52.396 --> 16:52.896
[SPEAKER_03]: 3DS now.

16:53.077 --> 16:53.497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

16:53.517 --> 16:55.598
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first time my 3DS is street passed.

16:55.878 --> 16:56.679
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's awesome?

16:56.979 --> 16:58.660
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about getting the 3DS on the show last week.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.260
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's awesome?

16:59.580 --> 17:01.621
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the mall yesterday.

17:01.761 --> 17:03.783
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the mall in the really nice part of town.

17:03.863 --> 17:04.703
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sucked.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Where all the spoiled rich kids are.

17:06.564 --> 17:07.265
[SPEAKER_04]: I went there.

17:07.425 --> 17:08.685
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Best Buy.

17:09.066 --> 17:11.487
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to some other stores.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.168
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, I've got to street pass with someone.

17:14.208 --> 17:18.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's like the demo unit in Best Buy, I'm going to street pass with someone before this day is over.

17:18.531 --> 17:19.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I get home and I see, oh,

17:20.932 --> 17:23.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the wireless was turned off the entire time.

17:24.013 --> 17:25.114
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really smart of me.

17:25.334 --> 17:30.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know they put the wireless switch on the 3DS exactly where they put the power switch on the old DSs.

17:30.316 --> 17:30.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

17:31.056 --> 17:32.436
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

17:33.997 --> 17:34.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

17:37.373 --> 17:46.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, apparently I'm getting a link from Derek H in our chatroom is actually linking us to this website here as a part of cha-cha.com.

17:47.401 --> 17:47.921
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

17:48.822 --> 17:49.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Mensa members.

17:50.783 --> 17:53.785
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually a link of some hot people that are Mensa members.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Some celebrities.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guarantee I'm not part of that list.

17:59.490 --> 18:02.612
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not because all these people have tits, Loki.

18:03.192 --> 18:03.913
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not have tits.

18:05.774 --> 18:10.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Derek H, Gina Davis, Asia Carrera Portal 2, I also play some co-op

18:29.079 --> 18:32.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously not on PSM, but I played on Steam, which was a lot of fun.

18:32.802 --> 18:41.588
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we weren't using voice chat at all, because I was playing with Miklatov, and the way his place is set up, he couldn't talk, because he would wake someone up who was sleeping.

18:42.008 --> 18:46.792
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was playing with him, and we were using the text chat to type back and forth.

18:46.812 --> 18:52.556
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Portal also has, if you use the F key, you can point at things, like telling people where to put the portals.

18:53.016 --> 18:53.536
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was nice.

18:53.556 --> 18:57.119
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I would get really frustrated, I'd hit F like a thousand times on the point where I want to...

18:57.719 --> 18:58.919
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, have him put a portal.

18:59.179 --> 18:59.679
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was fun.

18:59.699 --> 18:59.959
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

18:59.979 --> 19:01.000
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you each have a terminus?

19:02.140 --> 19:02.620
[SPEAKER_04]: On the portal?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, you each, it's like four portals.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.581
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the co-op puzzles are four portals because you each have a portal guide.

19:08.601 --> 19:11.202
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like one's not the orange and the other's the blue?

19:11.242 --> 19:17.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, one's dark blue and light blue and the other one's dark orange and like, or I should say light orange and red sort of thing.

19:17.463 --> 19:17.703
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

19:17.723 --> 19:25.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know that in the original portal back, if you look at the beta pictures of it, they had a purple and pink portal originally.

19:25.225 --> 19:26.945
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if they maybe borrowed the same scheme.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.111
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:46.583 --> 19:50.605
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's only one gel that they didn't take from that game.

19:51.645 --> 19:52.825
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a sticky, I think.

19:52.945 --> 19:59.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to look it up again, but yeah, they took the repulsion and propulsion gel from another game and they actually hired them all to help work with Portal 2.

20:00.047 --> 20:02.128
[SPEAKER_04]: The white gel is Portal wall gel.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Moon rocks!

20:03.388 --> 20:05.089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, instantly have a portal wherever you want.

20:05.789 --> 20:18.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, that, uh, it wasn't even supposed to have portals, but yeah, the game's still fun, exciting, uh, co-op mode's great, I haven't beat it yet, but we're probably, like, I don't know, like, think we're through three of the, the areas, so, I think there's, like, five or six.

20:19.647 --> 20:19.747
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

20:20.908 --> 20:21.409
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

20:45.610 --> 21:02.635
[SPEAKER_04]: it is not only the original Final Fantasy 4 game redone it is redone in the style of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the PSP or 1 and 2 on the iPhone which was taken from the PSP versions not 3 which was taken from the DS versions but 4 has been reimagined like 1 and 2 were with redone sprites redone music

21:03.075 --> 21:03.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool, though.

21:03.676 --> 21:06.378
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go in and enable the original music if you'd like to hear that.

21:07.299 --> 21:11.663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the modern translation, not the original Ted Woosley one from the 90s.

21:11.943 --> 21:12.323
[SPEAKER_04]: That's out.

21:12.363 --> 21:13.284
[SPEAKER_06]: You spoony bard.

21:13.724 --> 21:14.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they keep that line in.

21:14.685 --> 21:15.726
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to keep that line in.

21:15.746 --> 21:21.171
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest is the proper story with all the proper text for everything.

21:22.871 --> 21:45.998
[SPEAKER_04]: and it also has the After Years the complete set of the After Years games which were released for several bucks a pop on the Wii and did not have souped up graphics at all it was just the same graphics from the original Super Nintendo version so it's pretty cool that they released all that in one package and it has a transition episode that's completely brand new that transitions between the two games so all of it is new um

21:47.003 --> 21:48.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

21:49.445 --> 21:50.526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful looking.

21:50.846 --> 21:52.167
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that it's still 2D.

21:52.487 --> 21:55.109
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hate the 3D one on the DS.

21:55.289 --> 21:57.991
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was great, and I'm glad they did that.

21:58.031 --> 22:02.114
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's nice to kind of play it still the old school way, just with all the souped up graphics.

22:02.614 --> 22:07.278
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish this is what we could get more of on arcade or virtual console, for fuck's sake.

22:07.478 --> 22:09.379
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a great thing for them to have released.

22:09.740 --> 22:11.141
[SPEAKER_04]: But it works great on the PSP.

22:11.841 --> 22:12.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

22:31.289 --> 22:32.070
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:59.005 --> 23:26.410
[SPEAKER_04]: and I gotta say Minecraft the website is not I'm gonna just be honest this is my true reaction a lot of people are gonna think I'm an idiot and that's fine but I'll own up to it I did not find the Minecraft site to be very user friendly because it took me a minute to kind of figure out there's like an old version that's free or there's an old multiplayer or there's a new one that you can pay for and a new multi like there's so many different modes and it's the website's kind of dated looking and whatever so I finally found my way into the game and I played it and um

23:28.411 --> 23:53.780
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it like I don't get the big deal sorry guys like I don't understand why people are hailing Minecraft it's like oh my god like maybe it's more fun with more people or whatever but I found it to be about as thrilling as the program from Lego that lets you build your own Lego structures and then you can order the bricks and actually build them like all yeah um don't get me wrong that's kind of awesome too but um I did not think Minecraft was like OMG yeah

23:54.760 --> 23:55.341
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you.

23:55.621 --> 23:56.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play it too?

23:56.682 --> 23:57.322
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played Minecraft.

23:57.382 --> 23:58.203
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't care for it.

23:58.503 --> 23:58.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

23:58.943 --> 24:00.004
[SPEAKER_06]: And that made me kind of sick.

24:00.684 --> 24:05.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, but you got the whole first person shooter thing going on that you don't usually do well with those.

24:06.008 --> 24:08.289
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I didn't get it.

24:08.790 --> 24:10.411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's put together very well either.

24:10.431 --> 24:12.052
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's not presented very well.

24:12.092 --> 24:22.899
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's one of those like hipster things that like if you're into it, you're hip because it's like, you know, hard to, you know, get in there and play and all that and build these things, whatever.

24:24.920 --> 24:49.035
[SPEAKER_04]: for some reason I was reminded of a really old game on the Super Nintendo called Populous where you could kind of build and this is also on I want to say like Amiga I think it was originally an Amiga game and obviously I had a PC port at some point too and you like raised and lowered land to keep your people safe and you kind of like played God so to speak I don't know why but with the whole like building blocks and then taking them away I

24:51.938 --> 24:56.564
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've played something like it before.

24:56.604 --> 24:58.126
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't feel that innovative to me.

24:58.786 --> 24:59.687
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry.

25:00.228 --> 25:01.410
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that makes me not cool.

25:01.690 --> 25:02.211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not hip.

25:02.231 --> 25:03.773
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's cool either.

25:07.120 --> 25:33.479
[SPEAKER_04]: Other housekeeping, you can always join us on Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR Just the abbreviation there If you want to follow us there, and of course check us out on our website www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com No shows we're taking off in the foreseeable future We do have our 9th anniversary show coming up at the end of June But that's still a good 6 weeks away So we'll give you more details on that as we get closer

25:33.999 --> 26:01.473
[SPEAKER_04]: for now let's get into gaming news or as I should say you have to remember what OLR is all about you know we don't it's very very very very rare we ever break news on this show a lot of times you know we like to be friends sitting around the table talking smack about games so sometimes it's about putting the news out there on the table to discuss so because I don't think this is going to be news to anyone but we need to put it out there on the table so Loki please let's address the pink elephant in the room

26:01.872 --> 26:02.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

26:02.692 --> 26:03.913
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Network's been down?

26:05.833 --> 26:06.594
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's been down.

26:07.554 --> 26:16.937
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've actually bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 or Mortal Kombat, which were huge, huge releases on PS3 the week you were out, and now you can't play either of them online.

26:17.157 --> 26:17.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

26:19.017 --> 26:20.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Never used PlayStation Network.

26:22.499 --> 26:24.619
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's been down for a while.

26:25.299 --> 26:26.760
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they even...

26:28.698 --> 26:31.559
[SPEAKER_03]: They even went and had a press conference yesterday.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, press conference.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Making everything official.

26:36.421 --> 26:37.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, don't fear.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's gonna be okay.

26:40.062 --> 26:44.664
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, apparently they're gonna be returning some services to the PlayStation Network this week.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Full services within this month.

26:47.922 --> 26:51.746
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I just need to interrupt and say something because this is really important, Loki.

26:52.266 --> 27:04.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, part of, you know, kind of the, the thing that, you know, with the hack and everything is that credit card data was exposed, or at least they say, possibly could have been compromised, which hadn't come out at the time of last week's show.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.858
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to say, I called it.

27:07.019 --> 27:07.219
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

27:07.539 --> 27:09.781
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I really hate being right sometimes.

27:09.881 --> 27:12.402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the second time this year I've been right on some major news.

27:12.722 --> 27:19.886
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one we'll get to in a little bit because I've not had a chance to gloat with Loki here on the show but I'll get my fair share in just after we cover this story.

27:21.278 --> 27:21.678
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

27:23.079 --> 27:50.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the list of services that are returning to the PlayStation Network this week are the restoration of online gameplay across the PlayStation 3 and PSP systems, and it says including tiles that require online verification and download games, access to music unlimited power by Curiosity, which I might add, Curiosity is a terrible name for a service, so thanks, Sony, for coming up with a new word that begins with Q. All right.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Access to account management and password reset.

27:54.531 --> 27:58.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's important considering that our account's been breached and we need to change their passwords.

27:58.513 --> 27:59.434
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have a choice.

27:59.874 --> 28:01.995
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to make you change your password when you come back on.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big part of it.

28:03.476 --> 28:10.860
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only that, you have to do it from the original PS3 or an email thing because some people have changed their PlayStation 3s.

28:12.461 --> 28:17.885
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Home, Friendslist, and Chat Functionality are coming back.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.270
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some other fun stuff, of course.

28:25.011 --> 28:36.259
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to be, as their Welcome Back program, they're going to be offering some free stuff for you because they're sorry...

28:37.361 --> 28:47.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the free stuff that they're going to be offering, uh, a free download with, uh, I believe they are saying that was worth, uh, $20 maybe?

28:48.814 --> 28:52.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then 30 days free of PlayStation Plus.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.082
[SPEAKER_03]: Curocity, 30 Days of Curocity, and a download.

29:19.526 --> 29:24.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though all your personal information has been stolen, one download should make you forget all about that, right?

29:24.749 --> 29:24.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh?

29:25.029 --> 29:25.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

29:25.529 --> 29:25.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

29:26.750 --> 29:26.950
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

29:27.550 --> 29:27.810
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe?

29:30.212 --> 29:32.012
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really say the download price.

29:32.893 --> 29:37.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Kazurai was saying a few thousand yen worth of free downloads, so like $20 or $25.

29:40.658 --> 29:42.679
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, yeah, that's interesting.

29:43.960 --> 29:51.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, of course, uh, there's gonna be a new PlayStation 3 firmware accompanying with the relaunch of the PlayStation Network.

29:52.423 --> 29:57.946
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that the network is physically being rebuilt, um, because apparently it was just inferior as it was.

29:58.506 --> 30:01.988
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it might help that if they didn't, you know, store these same, uh,

30:02.748 --> 30:09.110
[SPEAKER_03]: On the same servers, your credit card information and all that stuff with the servers that actually sell product.

30:09.710 --> 30:15.511
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to keep that stuff separate in case one gets hacked or the store gets hacked, which is more likely.

30:16.852 --> 30:17.972
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be doing that.

30:18.852 --> 30:30.195
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, to make them sound like they're really on top of it, well, it's something we were planning on doing anyway, so we're just going to do it quicker now.

30:31.809 --> 30:32.770
[SPEAKER_03]: We were on top of this!

30:53.360 --> 31:00.428
[SPEAKER_03]: are now forming task forces or sending inquiries about what's going on.

31:00.448 --> 31:06.854
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess Homeland Security and the FBI are going to be helping them out, investigating the data breach and all that stuff.

31:09.497 --> 31:11.159
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's supposed to make us feel good.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.262
[SPEAKER_03]: So great, our tax money is going to...

31:15.703 --> 31:17.425
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:35.059 --> 31:38.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting access to the store through custom firmware or something like that.

31:39.082 --> 31:40.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some development side or something.

31:41.244 --> 31:41.544
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

31:41.564 --> 31:42.865
[SPEAKER_06]: What if they staged this whole thing?

31:43.185 --> 31:46.227
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the whole thing is... Here's what it was.

31:46.508 --> 31:50.210
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really terrible because all they were doing the entire time was... Oh, those hackers!

31:50.250 --> 31:51.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Those hackers got in!

31:51.909 --> 31:59.896
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet there was never, oh, well, we're stupid and we didn't, you know, first off, we didn't encrypt any of your personal data.

32:01.057 --> 32:01.837
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny, you know.

32:02.158 --> 32:03.379
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll laugh about that later on.

32:03.919 --> 32:09.504
[SPEAKER_03]: And then second, you know, their servers were the same servers for, you know, all that stuff.

32:09.984 --> 32:10.625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

32:10.825 --> 32:11.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now you may.

32:13.309 --> 32:16.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not going to be a satisfied PlayStation customer.

32:18.352 --> 32:28.997
[SPEAKER_04]: You can throw all this free shit at me, although I don't think, honestly, and this is one of the pro-Sony things I'm going to say, because I don't consider myself a Sony fanboy or an Xbox fanboy or any of it.

32:30.098 --> 32:37.621
[SPEAKER_04]: I chew out everyone equally, because I love gaming, and these companies screw things up, and it's usually at a management level.

32:37.701 --> 32:38.562
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me angry.

32:39.889 --> 32:47.254
[SPEAKER_04]: And what makes me, the free stuff here, I don't think actually Sony really owes you anything for free because the network was free in the first place.

32:47.354 --> 32:51.197
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if your credit card gets hacked, you don't ask the bank for free money.

32:51.897 --> 32:59.322
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you have a protection with your bank that the bank will, you know, if you have a fraudulent charge, you're protected against that.

32:59.342 --> 33:03.445
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any type of decent credit card or bank, you're protected against fraud and all that stuff.

33:09.229 --> 33:09.610
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

33:26.053 --> 33:29.675
[SPEAKER_04]: If you weren't monitoring your stuff before, you're an idiot.

33:30.776 --> 33:35.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, but this should have been a severe wake-up call to you if you haven't been monitoring your stuff before.

33:35.858 --> 33:39.600
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you could get your stuff stolen from a gas pump from one of those readers.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.923
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get your stuff stolen from any clerk or any waiter at a restaurant that you give your cards to.

33:44.483 --> 33:46.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Your card number gets out there exposed all the time.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.645
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to monitor that stuff.

33:48.685 --> 33:51.867
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this didn't serve as a wake-up call to you, I don't know what to tell you.

33:52.307 --> 33:55.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the best way around any real risk is use cash.

33:57.110 --> 34:00.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I suppose there's that too, but I don't want to be Tim Foyle hat either.

34:01.673 --> 34:05.396
[SPEAKER_04]: My agreement with the bank, I'm fucking paying Visa, right?

34:05.456 --> 34:12.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's either the interest that they're making off the credit card to begin with, or in the case of debit cards, they take a percentage of the sale and so forth.

34:13.161 --> 34:16.103
[SPEAKER_04]: These companies are paid to prevent fraud.

34:18.709 --> 34:23.492
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem here is, I need to hear more about how Sony is going to prevent this from happening again.

34:24.512 --> 34:27.194
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand they're hiring a privacy officer, which is fine.

34:27.654 --> 34:31.956
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that they're moving their data center, whether it was planned already or not, whatever.

34:32.297 --> 34:34.478
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're finally understanding, whoops, we fucked up.

34:34.658 --> 34:38.260
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of one of those, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

34:38.280 --> 34:45.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if they put the damn thing back up, and then they just get hacked again, they're going to be dead as a company.

34:46.344 --> 34:46.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

34:46.744 --> 34:46.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

34:48.165 --> 34:52.768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like when Jack in the Box killed the people with E.C.O.L.I.E.

34:52.868 --> 34:54.470
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably about 15 years ago.

34:55.110 --> 35:02.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Right after that happened, they were the safest restaurant to eat at because you knew if they were going to mess up again, they would be out of business, every single one of them.

35:02.555 --> 35:05.357
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been able to recover from what was an unfortunate mess.

35:05.417 --> 35:10.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously, very different scenarios because you're talking lives are not at stake in this scenario, what's going on with Sony.

35:11.281 --> 35:17.185
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there still is certainly a big passion, big headline news thing going on here.

35:18.125 --> 35:30.456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's some other things to consider, though, is that what Sony got is that Sony needs to kind of ask themselves, you know, how are we going to prevent the hacking happening in the future?

35:30.976 --> 35:32.698
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not condoning the hacking at all.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.200
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, because I see some stuff going on in the chatroom.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.020
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make it clear.

35:36.741 --> 35:39.563
[SPEAKER_04]: The ultimate problem is not with Sony.

35:39.623 --> 35:43.367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's with the hackers and whoever went into the system in the first place.

35:43.747 --> 35:44.888
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the problem.

35:45.368 --> 35:46.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.

35:46.389 --> 35:51.694
[SPEAKER_04]: If they try to use that credit card data that was stolen at this point, they're going to have the FBI up their ass.

35:52.254 --> 36:04.966
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a hacker that did this or you're somebody that buys this data from the hackers, you are an absolute moron who's just begging to go to jail because you're going to have every state agency so far up your butt.

36:05.226 --> 36:06.067
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be real.

36:06.187 --> 36:08.509
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do have that data, you really shouldn't use it.

36:10.393 --> 36:11.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be fair, okay?

36:11.875 --> 36:14.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, and so I certainly don't condone that.

36:14.318 --> 36:27.232
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, hacking to that level where you are stealing information, whatever, and if they are trying to sell it for a profit, as some folks are saying, it's up on forums and so forth, but, you know, what's real and what's trolling?

36:27.533 --> 36:27.953
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.

36:28.113 --> 36:29.155
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where's the line drawn?

36:29.435 --> 36:30.656
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't condone the hacking.

36:31.363 --> 36:37.528
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you can't help but feel like Sony kind of opened themselves up to it a little bit.

36:38.289 --> 36:42.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Sony kind of come out in the schoolyard and kind of wave their hand saying, come at us?

36:43.311 --> 36:48.535
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times do they get up there on the stage at E3 and say, our system is unhackable?

36:48.555 --> 36:48.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

36:49.235 --> 37:03.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing this out there, and I'm not sure on the accuracy of the rumor, but let's just pretend that it's real here, because it would fall in line with the lack of dedication to safety, I guess, or of our information.

37:03.866 --> 37:12.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the rumor is that that credit card list was encrypted with the same keys that they use for the PlayStation 3.

37:14.198 --> 37:14.578
Oops.

37:16.700 --> 37:21.463
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point is, and what I really want to get at here, and this is how Sony can really earn back my trust.

37:22.183 --> 37:25.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop being so fucking hard headed.

37:27.147 --> 37:29.828
[SPEAKER_04]: It is time to admit your vulnerability.

37:30.369 --> 37:32.490
[SPEAKER_04]: And this press conference yesterday didn't cut it.

37:33.171 --> 37:39.515
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't cut it because essentially they came out there and they just, you know, they're trying to point fingers at everybody else except themselves.

37:41.363 --> 37:44.368
[SPEAKER_04]: and honestly what really needs to happen is management needs to be shaken up.

37:44.689 --> 37:46.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaz Harai needs to come down.

37:47.193 --> 37:47.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

37:48.235 --> 37:52.321
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what is really going to make me happy is for PlayStation to change their management.

37:52.582 --> 37:54.285
[SPEAKER_04]: However, unfortunately I don't see that happening.

37:54.711 --> 38:00.758
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what's going to restore a lot of faith that customers might have in them is for them to display that level of accountability.

38:01.399 --> 38:04.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Accountability for me, especially, is a big thing with a company.

38:04.762 --> 38:09.227
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I'm seeing none of that, then I'm not going to give them my business.

38:10.108 --> 38:14.172
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why I've pretty much decided I don't think I'm going to get anything else for PS3.

38:15.441 --> 38:39.030
[SPEAKER_04]: at the end of the day I think Sony can win me back I mean it's not like corporations don't do dumb things once in a while and excuse me Xbox fanboys excuse me the Red Ring of Death thing was atrocious and was horrible on Microsoft's part but they've come a long way since then to be fair and they finally did extend their warranty and they admitted their problem that's what I need Sony to do here

38:41.647 --> 38:45.429
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't... Until they have some accountability, I don't think I'm going to give them my business.

38:47.571 --> 38:54.295
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but it's a hard situation because, you know, I can see how some of you are thinking, well, Rob, is that saying what the hackers did is okay?

38:54.935 --> 38:56.196
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not what I'm saying.

38:56.476 --> 38:57.997
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hackers did is not okay.

38:58.818 --> 39:01.039
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I've said on the show before, hackers are going to hack.

39:01.079 --> 39:05.342
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, this news, we've seen this stuff about Sony and so forth.

39:05.902 --> 39:07.343
[SPEAKER_04]: They really have just been inviting it.

39:07.383 --> 39:08.204
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole thing about...

39:08.684 --> 39:35.892
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to subpoena everybody's PlayStation 3 that ever accessed a website even remotely related to this Geohots thing When he admitted he wasn't even coming after data in the first place He just wanted to get the other OS thing back or whatever I mean, let's be real, this all traces back to Sony taking off the other OS feature If Sony had never done that, this would have never happened Yeah, but hindsight, you know Right, but maybe it needed to happen

39:37.336 --> 40:01.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we were all getting a little too comfortable with this whole digital distribution thing Maybe this, you know, and I've said this before on the show and I still mean it This is going to set digital distribution back a little bit because this goes beyond Sony This is going to affect that horrific copyright protection thing that Capcom has If you bought a game like Bionic Commander or whatever you haven't been able to play it for the past 11 days on PlayStation 3

40:02.708 --> 40:04.970
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're having class action lawsuits against only Sony.

40:05.470 --> 40:05.870
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.351
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to file one against Capcom.

40:08.011 --> 40:08.212
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

40:08.372 --> 40:08.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

40:09.072 --> 40:10.333
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play a game I bought.

40:10.613 --> 40:13.195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of your problem.

40:15.056 --> 40:16.116
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I like to see happen.

40:16.357 --> 40:16.857
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I agree.

40:18.986 --> 40:27.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to the chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Derek H in our chatroom says, I would like a press release saying they've hired a hit team to track down and assassinate the hackers.

40:27.808 --> 40:31.729
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting, I did feel like at that press conference day they were really trying to finger point at Anonymous.

40:32.570 --> 40:41.752
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know who did it, and I know they keep saying, well it could be Anonymous, but they said they didn't do it, but there's no head to Anonymous, so it could have been another cell of Anonymous.

40:42.250 --> 40:47.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the whole thing was I think is people used Anonymous because there was that whole conflict going.

40:47.933 --> 40:55.376
[SPEAKER_03]: So whoever it was that was planning on doing this probably said, oh, now seems like a good time because they're going to be looking at them or be distracted by them.

40:55.456 --> 40:57.097
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's when they went and did it.

40:57.917 --> 41:12.206
[SPEAKER_03]: and if it was actually what the rumor is where that it was part of this rebug firmware that was out there that gave you basically development access that you could actually download content for free and stuff.

41:12.246 --> 41:22.073
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the rumors I heard that one of the reasons that they took the store down because someone found a way to basically steal PlayStation Network content

41:22.913 --> 41:24.434
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

41:50.494 --> 41:53.116
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, well, that doesn't sound very sure of yourself now.

41:53.357 --> 41:54.417
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a CYA move.

41:56.239 --> 42:00.582
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, and also, I guarantee that a few people may have lost their jobs over this.

42:01.283 --> 42:03.084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always unfortunate for job loss.

42:03.364 --> 42:11.390
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope the right people lost their jobs over this because if it was the people down in the trenches, that's not who needs to be losing their jobs over it.

42:12.011 --> 42:14.553
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to just go off speculation either.

42:14.593 --> 42:17.035
[SPEAKER_04]: If Sony shook up their management, I want to see the receipts.

42:19.811 --> 42:47.239
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the chat room with some more comments here Ranma says Sky yes Microsoft got a black eye for the Red Ring of Death but Microsoft stepped up to the plates and handled it when people bitched at Nintendo about the Wiimotes they stepped up now that people are bitching to Sony they turn a blind eye and say there's not a problem Jedi mind trick my ass absolutely right that's my whole point and I don't think that press conference yesterday cut it and I really don't know what is to blame except the management at Sony

42:48.600 --> 42:50.782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being a poorly managed company right now.

42:52.843 --> 42:53.364
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

42:55.543 --> 43:02.125
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see, also, um, some other folks in chat, uh, Defective Candy saying, Gah, it wasn't Anon!

43:02.225 --> 43:03.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Bangs her head against the desk.

43:03.626 --> 43:19.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, the only problem Anon has is that because it is the way it is, and I'm not knocking Anon, like, you know, whatever, it's just a subculture of the internet, but the problem with Anon is because it has no face, it's really easy to point the finger at them.

43:20.111 --> 43:31.077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy for Kazurai to get up there and say, well, Anon was in our systems, and Anon did this hacking, and we're sending the FBI and the top people on this, and we're going to make an example out of some of those Anon kids.

43:31.117 --> 43:32.197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very easy to blame them.

43:34.599 --> 43:35.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good luck.

43:35.899 --> 43:42.022
[SPEAKER_03]: They have yet to find any of these people anyways, and how are they going to prove who did it?

43:42.182 --> 43:43.323
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best thing about it.

43:43.363 --> 43:44.564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough.

43:44.584 --> 43:49.106
[SPEAKER_06]: The smartest thing any type of vigilante group can do on top of that is to be completely decentralized.

43:53.501 --> 43:58.242
[SPEAKER_04]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, I don't think that's necessarily related to anything about Geohots or Anonymous.

43:58.262 --> 43:59.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has a lot of other enemies.

44:02.063 --> 44:08.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps everything else that was going on with the other companies showed the real person who hacked all this how easy it was to do.

44:09.565 --> 44:14.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, I still think though a lot of what happened leading up to this helped whoever did it.

44:15.186 --> 44:18.927
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got an email coming up that's got a pretty interesting suggestion, so I'm going to

44:19.787 --> 44:20.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

44:21.388 --> 44:33.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my suggestion, though, is all this free stuff you're throwing my way, like free download and free PlayStation Plus and free Curiosity, I don't care about two-thirds of that.

44:33.515 --> 44:47.903
[SPEAKER_03]: And the download, I might not even care about that either, so... I mean, that's like saying... Imagine, if you will, Rob, that you went to a restaurant, a nice restaurant or whatever, or not even necessarily a nice restaurant.

44:48.123 --> 44:48.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Say you went to

44:50.322 --> 44:50.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack in the Box.

44:51.023 --> 44:52.203
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll use Jack in the Box again.

44:52.724 --> 45:07.875
[SPEAKER_03]: And you went there and you bought something and someone stole your credit card information, stole your identity, and you found out, you went to the management, and they're like, here's a voucher for a free jumbo jack.

45:09.917 --> 45:10.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

45:11.358 --> 45:13.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, would that cut it with you?

45:13.179 --> 45:16.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would be kind of like,

45:18.857 --> 45:19.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

45:20.698 --> 45:21.718
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you're giving me?

45:23.679 --> 45:24.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though.

45:24.640 --> 45:29.402
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not fully convinced that only Sony is vulnerable to a hack like this.

45:30.922 --> 45:34.704
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've heard of other personal data being compromised on other websites and so forth.

45:35.084 --> 45:45.109
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure I fully believe that my information is 100% secure with Microsoft, with one of their online services, Steam, with Blizzard,

45:46.036 --> 45:46.757
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

45:47.177 --> 45:49.079
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to freak out about it.

45:49.119 --> 46:00.611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to panic and I'm not going to cancel all my credit cards and all that stuff because the money I pay to have a debit or credit card in the first place is supposed to pay to protect me from the fraud.

46:02.532 --> 46:04.794
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not that worried about it.

46:05.154 --> 46:11.619
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I can thank the PlayStation Network for being so useless to me that the last time I used my credit card, it had expired that same month!

46:11.699 --> 46:12.639
[SPEAKER_03]: So, ha ha ha!

46:13.440 --> 46:14.861
[SPEAKER_03]: You have old credit card information.

46:14.981 --> 46:16.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck spending that money.

46:16.622 --> 46:22.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan was saying right before the show, though, is that the one time he finally decided to buy something on PlayStation Network, that was when Moondiver came out.

46:22.666 --> 46:24.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's done by the dude that did Strider.

46:26.569 --> 46:28.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Then all this goes down, and he's like, well, shit.

46:28.511 --> 46:28.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

46:30.807 --> 46:33.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, we never really used PlayStation Network.

46:33.268 --> 46:34.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I had zero interest in it.

46:34.549 --> 46:40.814
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't make a profile until we had our system for two years, if that's any indication, when I was playing Final Fantasy XIII.

46:42.935 --> 46:48.440
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go back to this, too, in our chatroom, because this is a good point, and it came up on my Twitter earlier, but it hasn't come up yet on the show here tonight.

46:48.801 --> 46:52.204
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerCon, our chatroom, says, You don't have to worry about Nintendo getting hacked.

46:52.324 --> 46:55.007
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't hold any personal info other than friend codes.

46:55.647 --> 47:07.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, despite the shit we've given Nintendo over the years about being so fucking far behind the times when it comes to online stuff, right now, their way of handling credit card payments looks pretty fucking good.

47:08.829 --> 47:09.530
[SPEAKER_04]: In light of all this?

47:09.970 --> 47:12.772
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather have security than convenience.

47:13.973 --> 47:17.817
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, the Nintendo Wii makes you put in your complete credit card info every time.

47:18.157 --> 47:18.877
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't save it.

47:19.158 --> 47:20.599
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes they can get a little frustrating.

47:20.619 --> 47:22.801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, here I am, putting it in again on the Wiimote.

47:23.041 --> 47:25.283
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, that system looks pretty darn good.

47:27.955 --> 47:29.476
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't because I'm sorry.

47:30.076 --> 47:33.378
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'd actually buy anything on Virtual Console right now.

47:33.478 --> 47:33.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

47:35.419 --> 47:38.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's praise Nintendo for being lazy.

47:38.501 --> 47:40.762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying praise them.

47:41.402 --> 47:52.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it's ironic how this all kind of works out where Nintendo has really nothing to lose with what happened here because of the fact they're so far behind the times.

47:52.368 --> 47:55.770
[SPEAKER_04]: So my only point is that maybe we were moving ahead too fast.

47:56.564 --> 47:57.244
[SPEAKER_03]: People are motivated by spite.

48:19.606 --> 48:27.833
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to... People like being competitive and people like challenging things that you're giving them, especially a company.

48:28.053 --> 48:31.656
[SPEAKER_03]: They like looking at the company as the evil corporate giant.

48:32.076 --> 48:41.164
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go and say, well, good luck doing that, people are going to take the David and Goliath route and they're going to try to bring Goliath down.

48:42.585 --> 48:47.347
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for every hundred people that try and fail, someone's going to do it.

48:47.567 --> 48:49.867
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know how you avoid that?

48:50.227 --> 48:52.748
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go saying, try to hack me.

48:55.109 --> 48:59.830
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking in the chat room at chat.orange.com, there's lots of interesting stuff going on in the chat room right now.

49:00.550 --> 49:00.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

49:01.010 --> 49:03.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator in our chat room says, I really didn't expect any freebies.

49:03.891 --> 49:07.392
[SPEAKER_04]: All I'd like is an I'm sorry and assurance that they're learning from their mistakes.

49:07.512 --> 49:07.852
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

49:08.273 --> 49:09.533
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great, actually.

49:10.554 --> 49:15.918
[SPEAKER_04]: Derek H in our chat says, Sky, that's like saying a horse and carriage looks good after you get into a car accident.

49:16.219 --> 49:24.265
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's really funny that you use that as an example because my mom has a true diagnosed fear of driving cars and vehicles and all that.

49:24.706 --> 49:29.250
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it has to do with the fact that she just didn't like them whatever growing up or what have you.

49:29.670 --> 49:35.295
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one time she decided to buck her fear and get behind the wheel of a car after going through the process, getting a license, all that stuff,

49:35.575 --> 49:35.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

49:57.462 --> 50:24.880
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually will say this I do prefer Nintendo's method of not storing the information because whenever I pay the only I think online thing ever that has my information saved is my PayPal which I used to pay for any online service now because I can stop my information from PayPal and the site won't have my information or my WoW subscription but other than that nowhere else has my information

50:25.764 --> 50:33.031
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, you know, the Battlestar Galactica wasn't affected by the Cylon attack because it didn't use as much future technology as the other Battlestars.

50:33.111 --> 50:33.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent point, Bobby.

50:34.872 --> 50:36.674
[SPEAKER_04]: At least somebody's on the same wavelength as me.

50:38.735 --> 50:39.056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

50:39.516 --> 50:41.678
[SPEAKER_04]: I, yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.

50:42.619 --> 50:43.960
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that hasn't already been said.

50:44.180 --> 50:47.223
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, where's the, I'm sorry.

50:47.243 --> 50:47.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

50:48.680 --> 50:49.400
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

50:50.141 --> 50:50.661
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

50:50.981 --> 50:55.804
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have another story that's kind of in the same vein as a lot of this stuff, if you will.

50:56.684 --> 50:58.565
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did I say was the root cause of all of this?

50:58.745 --> 51:02.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony removing the other OWASP feature in the past.

51:03.087 --> 51:07.410
[SPEAKER_04]: And interesting enough, Sony's troubles may not be over as far as that's concerned.

51:07.810 --> 51:11.672
[SPEAKER_04]: They've actually lost what could be a landmark decision in this whole thing.

51:11.792 --> 51:12.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the deal.

51:12.852 --> 51:16.935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as major as it might seem, but it happened in Finland.

51:18.715 --> 51:20.997
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happened by what's called a consumer's board.

51:21.077 --> 51:23.438
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a ruling, but it's a consumer's board.

51:23.518 --> 51:39.666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily a government legitimate courtroom ruling, but the consumer's board in Finland has decided that this man who actually took Sony to court over removing the other OS feature, that Sony needs to cough up 100 euros for doing it.

51:40.796 --> 51:42.497
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:06.215 --> 52:14.499
[SPEAKER_04]: The CCB said that the removal of other OS crippled console features that were present at the time of purchase and agreed that consumers should be compensated.

52:14.959 --> 52:20.021
[SPEAKER_04]: It recommended that the manufacturer and seller of the console pay 100 euros jointly to compensate the man.

52:20.541 --> 52:29.025
[SPEAKER_04]: The CCB does not have the power to enforce the ruling, but the opinion of this board in Finland is considered by the courts in a dispute.

52:30.045 --> 52:33.707
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning if it does go to court, this will weigh heavily on what happens.

52:34.527 --> 52:36.849
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

52:37.950 --> 52:44.195
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess if Sony truly thought their system... Well, this also kind of goes back to Sony being hard-headed.

52:44.635 --> 52:49.539
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony put the other OS feature in there because they were convinced it could not be used to hack their system because it was unhackable.

52:49.799 --> 52:52.861
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute they found it, it was hackable, they removed it.

52:53.022 --> 52:54.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you shouldn't have put it there in the first place!

52:57.002 --> 53:01.505
[SPEAKER_03]: And still, though, it's like saying, you know, oh, well, this feature, no one's really using this feature.

53:02.566 --> 53:09.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's a feature on something, and you remove it, people are going to be pissed, because it is, somebody is obviously using it.

53:09.250 --> 53:11.631
[SPEAKER_03]: If no one was using it, why'd you put it there in the first place?

53:13.132 --> 53:15.474
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's like saying, oh, Spanish language?

53:15.874 --> 53:17.935
[SPEAKER_03]: No one uses a Spanish language.

53:18.695 --> 53:20.336
[SPEAKER_03]: They can just speak English or French.

53:20.356 --> 53:21.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

53:22.802 --> 53:23.503
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

53:23.703 --> 53:25.305
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see what develops with that.

53:25.345 --> 53:27.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony's troubles may not be over.

53:27.407 --> 53:34.755
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be talking about the legal team moving from whatever was going on with Geohots to now having to deal with class action lawsuits over the downtime.

53:35.616 --> 53:39.661
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole other OS lawsuit and there's a whole other nightmare of problems.

53:41.647 --> 53:43.948
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing in the background right now.

53:43.988 --> 53:44.728
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I hear.

53:45.128 --> 53:45.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

53:45.648 --> 53:49.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, don't you have something, just something to take my mind off all this other stuff?

53:49.169 --> 53:49.789
[SPEAKER_06]: How about some good news?

53:49.949 --> 53:50.409
[SPEAKER_04]: How about it?

53:50.669 --> 53:52.310
[SPEAKER_06]: How about something for Portal 2?

53:53.270 --> 53:55.990
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a new download content this summer.

53:56.651 --> 54:01.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve put out an announcement and it's free, which is great.

54:01.492 --> 54:10.954
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be called DLC number one and it will have new test chambers, leaderboards, challenge mode for single and multiplayer, quote, and more, end quote.

54:11.434 --> 54:30.562
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be on all platforms Mac, PC, Xbox 360 And maybe Playstation 3 Maybe If the system's up It'll be on PS3 I'm just making a poke But hey, that's pretty cool And I so much love the game already That it'd be kind of neat to have some new stuff to do

54:32.042 --> 54:43.865
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta admit though, every developer, every single one of them who makes money off DLC, who makes money off designing games specifically for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network platforms has gotta be looking at what's going on right now.

54:44.385 --> 54:45.446
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 days of lost sales.

54:45.646 --> 54:46.306
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is free.

54:46.666 --> 54:49.767
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, this is free, but it just reminds me of that whole thing.

54:50.307 --> 54:53.548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm saying the impact on the whole digital distribution thing will be felt.

54:55.106 --> 54:57.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I like free things, though.

54:57.708 --> 55:00.890
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we do get more maps and things that let this game live on.

55:00.950 --> 55:01.530
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great.

55:01.850 --> 55:08.434
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good value as it is, but just if they enhance that value, especially if they have a map editor for people, oh my gosh.

55:08.955 --> 55:13.357
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's one of the things I was hearing about going to be coming out, actually, is that they're... Awesome.

55:14.318 --> 55:16.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve's always been kind of cool, though.

55:16.599 --> 55:17.760
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what Gary's mod is, right?

55:18.200 --> 55:19.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

55:19.361 --> 55:23.984
[SPEAKER_06]: The modding community is really big out there, and they've paid to put some development into some of this.

55:24.545 --> 55:35.062
[SPEAKER_06]: so they're seeing people doing the same thing with Portal and are encouraging it and I think they're supposed to have I remembered hearing something about them having some sort of level sharing coming out

55:36.034 --> 55:37.996
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some fan wank discussion last night.

55:38.016 --> 55:44.180
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was one I was on WOW about talking about how awesome it would be if there was a Tron-themed portal level or something like that.

55:44.200 --> 55:48.403
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that fan wank could be a reality if they do release some of these map editors and things.

55:48.423 --> 55:49.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody will be on that.

55:49.264 --> 55:49.664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it.

55:50.265 --> 55:54.128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ironic, but the orange and blue would fit very well with the Tron universe, wouldn't it?

55:54.588 --> 55:56.629
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see.

55:56.810 --> 55:57.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and considering...

55:59.332 --> 55:59.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually it would.

56:00.452 --> 56:06.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine like a deathmatch portal type thing or like four player portal or something?

56:07.674 --> 56:08.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathmatch portal?

56:08.914 --> 56:09.214
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

56:11.275 --> 56:11.615
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

56:12.535 --> 56:17.917
[SPEAKER_04]: There's part of me that wants to say, no, they should think about the more competitive stuff when Portal 3 comes out.

56:18.237 --> 56:21.377
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a part of me that says, actually, Portal 3 should probably never come out.

56:22.178 --> 56:23.258
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there should be a Portal 3.

56:25.458 --> 56:30.001
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe it's like one of those movies that really doesn't need a sequel.

56:30.461 --> 56:32.823
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see at all possible how there could be a Portal 3.

56:33.763 --> 56:43.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, where there's money to be made, there is always... They're saying though that for Half-Life 3 that What's-Your-Face Chell is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.

56:43.990 --> 56:50.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, speaking of like Valve and things that end in 3, I'm not so sure that's a possibility with Valve actually.

56:51.707 --> 56:53.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they ever gotten to three in their series?

56:54.009 --> 56:58.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Half-Life 3 Episode 3 is supposed to be... Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

56:59.214 --> 57:00.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 3 is a myth, okay.

57:00.735 --> 57:01.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's see.

57:01.616 --> 57:02.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead.

57:02.616 --> 57:03.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first two came out real quick.

57:04.038 --> 57:05.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was never a third one.

57:05.679 --> 57:06.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal.

57:06.800 --> 57:07.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see.

57:08.221 --> 57:08.922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

57:08.962 --> 57:10.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they ever get to three?

57:11.484 --> 57:12.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing.

57:12.925 --> 57:13.426
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, you know...

57:14.249 --> 57:14.449
[SPEAKER_03]: VALVE

57:30.669 --> 57:35.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this could finally be where they do drop the bombshell about Half-Life Episode 3, but I don't know.

57:35.272 --> 57:37.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Left 4 Dead 3 with a portal gun in there.

57:38.695 --> 57:40.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe something new.

57:40.376 --> 57:43.658
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of trust Valve with new ideas right now, you know?

57:44.099 --> 57:50.503
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had a lot of good stuff, like Left 4 Dead, great game, often copied, portal, excellent little thing.

57:50.563 --> 57:53.425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm all for whatever they come out with next.

57:53.465 --> 57:57.468
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe one of the things they have on the horizon is their whole Defense of the Ancients.

57:57.948 --> 57:59.670
[SPEAKER_04]: Dota... I think it's called Dota 2?

58:00.610 --> 58:29.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Haha, another two Yeah, they have an official Dota thing coming out Which was originally a Warcraft 3 mod But they hired the people that made it It's not the same thing as League of Legends In fact, League of Legends is kind of The Defense of the Ancients thing has gone a million different ways Because Blizzard has their own thing coming to StarCraft League of Legends is out there too By I believe some of the people that were involved with Dota in the beginning And then the people that got hired from Valve For Dota have the official Dota 2 game coming out And I think that's probably what you're going to see Most of at E3 this year out of Valve

58:32.014 --> 58:50.588
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow free stuff yeah free stuff is good and I'm all for continuing to expand the terrific game that is Portal 2 but I would honestly still be happy with my purchase if they never expanded it but I think I'm still having fun oh yeah absolutely I just think it's a great value anyhow Loki let's move on

58:52.069 --> 58:52.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

58:53.030 --> 59:01.677
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other big story that was floating around the web, of course, is the oft-rumored sequel console for the Wii.

59:01.737 --> 59:04.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I mean, there's going to be a new console from Nintendo at some point.

59:05.821 --> 59:14.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Nintendo has officially announced that, yes, they will be talking about a successor to the Wii, not necessarily a Wii 2, but another console, coming for 2012.

59:14.308 --> 59:15.369
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, they're saying...

59:20.838 --> 59:44.001
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's gonna be shown off at E3 it's gonna be playable at E3 probably if you're pressing behind doors but you know it will be playable it'll be their thing that has the uber long line to play yes that's been Nintendo's E3 motif for years minus the airport years and of course you know tons of rumors about what it is and Project Cafe and all that fun stuff

59:44.501 --> 59:48.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, last week we talked at length about this, because a lot of the rumors had come out.

59:48.484 --> 59:50.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have the confirmation.

59:50.225 --> 59:53.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's saying, okay, yes, it's happening, and we'll see you at E3.

59:54.168 --> 59:55.209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the news from this week.

59:55.309 --> 59:57.351
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week we talked at length about a lot of that stuff, just so you know.

59:57.851 --> 59:59.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, would include...

01:00:01.262 --> 01:00:08.645
[SPEAKER_04]: When I, in January, on this program said, Nintendo is showing a new console at E3 this year because they've got nothing going for them on the Wii right now but that new Zelda game.

01:00:08.965 --> 01:00:11.186
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, Loki, said, no.

01:00:11.706 --> 01:00:12.487
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're not going to show.

01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:14.187
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the Wii still prints money.

01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:15.888
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to show a new console at E3.

01:00:16.268 --> 01:00:18.189
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to say, thank you.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:24.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but you're still wrong with them not having anything coming out on the Wii.

01:00:25.635 --> 01:00:26.716
[SPEAKER_03]: What's coming out on the Wii?

01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:48.193
[SPEAKER_03]: They need something for Christmas this year.

01:00:48.213 --> 01:00:51.697
[SPEAKER_03]: If the system isn't coming out until 2012, and to be fair, I had speculated, why are they waiting until 2012?

01:00:51.737 --> 01:00:52.898
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess they did the same thing with the 3DS.

01:00:52.938 --> 01:00:53.920
[SPEAKER_04]: They do need something this year.

01:01:06.255 --> 01:01:09.636
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually think you calling the new Super Mario Bros.

01:01:09.676 --> 01:01:34.506
[SPEAKER_03]: sequel I think is a distinct possibility for the rabbit out of their hat for the Wii this year I know you guys talked about this last week but I wasn't here so I'm just going to get my take on a lot of this and you love Nintendo more than anyone on this show so definitely wonder what your opinion is listen, we gotta think like Nintendo here and why they're doing what they're doing here's how it's going to all work I think let's take the name Project Cafe

01:01:35.754 --> 01:01:36.494
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a cafe?

01:01:36.515 --> 01:01:39.556
[SPEAKER_03]: A cafe is a place that you go gather with your friends.

01:01:39.616 --> 01:01:41.357
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very casual meeting place.

01:01:41.818 --> 01:01:45.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of chatting and interactivity and that kind of stuff.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:53.745
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe now the focus is going to be and that would be great if they actually did it more like online.

01:01:53.785 --> 01:01:59.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of think of like Facebook stuff where you're sharing stuff with your friends.

01:01:59.488 --> 01:02:01.429
[SPEAKER_03]: You're conversing.

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:03.691
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very casual stuff.

01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:07.871
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, lots of online content we'd hope

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:15.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I have to say, SJ100Matt in the chatroom says, Rob, the Christmas hot seller is the Vitality Sensor.

01:02:16.554 --> 01:02:18.935
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee you the Vitality Sensor is dead.

01:02:19.195 --> 01:02:20.336
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been swept under the rug.

01:02:20.877 --> 01:02:28.602
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you may see it rear its little ugly head on whatever, like, you know, just a little piece of metal on the back of some controller.

01:02:29.222 --> 01:02:31.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo will never fully scrap an idea.

01:02:31.784 --> 01:02:35.907
[SPEAKER_04]: It will rear its ugly head again at some point, but as far as the Wii Vitality Sensor...

01:02:36.207 --> 01:02:38.669
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it got laughed out of submission.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:40.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.412
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, you may see something like that.

01:02:43.733 --> 01:02:47.977
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is Nintendo we're talking about here, so I don't know if they're actually going to do that.

01:02:48.037 --> 01:02:58.205
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that now, being that this is the next generation of consoles, they would understand that, yes, okay, online gaming is something that people do want.

01:02:58.505 --> 01:02:59.386
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, social...

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:23.740
[SPEAKER_04]: community features something that people do like having because Facebook is popular all this stuff's popular let's let's bring it in okay so let's assume that they're gonna do oh god that's why the controllers are all touch screens because they're gonna want you to take them out in public just like the 3ds they're gonna want you to take those things with you wherever you go so when you meet people you could like do the game data trades just like the 3ds

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:25.679
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:42.314
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:03:56.255 --> 01:03:56.916
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

01:04:11.754 --> 01:04:12.435
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's that.

01:04:12.555 --> 01:04:14.396
[SPEAKER_04]: But like a fucking iPad as a controller?

01:04:14.536 --> 01:04:14.697
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:04:14.797 --> 01:04:16.378
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not anything like that.

01:04:17.279 --> 01:04:22.963
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, I would see maybe it's some sort... Because you have to also understand, Nintendo's not going to compete with themselves.

01:04:23.263 --> 01:04:27.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they release something that could be used as a portable gaming device when they have a portable gaming device?

01:04:27.546 --> 01:04:28.427
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.

01:04:29.007 --> 01:04:33.391
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, they would want you to use your 3DS or something like that for some sort of connectivity, but...

01:04:35.032 --> 01:04:35.673
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, okay?

01:04:35.753 --> 01:04:37.494
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing, too, is the cost of this thing.

01:04:37.514 --> 01:04:42.339
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if this controller's like $100, people are like, fuck that, I ain't buying a $100 controller.

01:04:42.639 --> 01:04:44.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the 3DS will stand in as a controller.

01:04:44.961 --> 01:04:46.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's how they don't bite themselves in the foot.

01:04:47.023 --> 01:04:49.025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a controller that will also do the 3D display.

01:04:49.706 --> 01:04:51.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's just assume, okay, let's say that...

01:04:53.206 --> 01:04:57.151
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't get me wrong, they could come up with some really low quality screen.

01:04:57.431 --> 01:05:01.095
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the PlayStation 1 little monitors that were 50 bucks or whatever.

01:05:01.496 --> 01:05:07.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you put a touch screen display on top of there, a touch panel display, you could kind of jerry-rig something like that.

01:05:08.063 --> 01:05:08.204
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

01:05:08.624 --> 01:05:12.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so let's say that's going to happen.

01:05:13.968 --> 01:05:15.549
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be interesting, I guess.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:19.371
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're also saying that they're still going to keep the original controls as well.

01:05:19.852 --> 01:05:25.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like I'm expecting, this system's probably just going to upscale these old Wii games.

01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:30.719
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how you see all this emulator footage with 1080p new Super Mario Bros.

01:05:30.739 --> 01:05:32.180
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that and how it looks really pretty?

01:05:33.817 --> 01:05:34.237
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go!

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:38.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Your games are brand new again and we can still sell Wii games.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're either going to take one of two approaches.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.962
[SPEAKER_03]: They're either going to try to get everybody to go up onto this new platform or they're going to try to keep this platform along with the Wii.

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:56.225
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the Wii for the casual people that don't want to spend a lot of money on stuff and then you have this new system for the hardcore players that really want something that has the graphics and all that.

01:05:56.685 --> 01:05:57.325
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what though?

01:05:57.365 --> 01:06:01.426
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have those Wii games that you want to buy, they look really pretty on your new HD...

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:10.309
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say, I think you are on the money on this.

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:11.049
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

01:06:11.689 --> 01:06:23.532
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate saying when you're, I think when you talk about this, yeah, and it's funny because somebody in chat, who said this in chat, said Amiga777 in chat said, please no illusions, the dolphin GameCube had next to nothing to do with water.

01:06:25.287 --> 01:06:31.091
[SPEAKER_04]: But I honestly think, like, what's the one place where everybody always razzes Nintendo online?

01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:33.352
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Nintendo want a piece of?

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:35.113
[SPEAKER_04]: What everybody's into?

01:06:35.714 --> 01:06:38.235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the Wii was all about, was trying to get everybody into gaming.

01:06:38.315 --> 01:06:42.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think they don't look at Facebook and say, hmm, how could we get a part of this?

01:06:43.038 --> 01:06:44.940
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope... This is the Facebook console.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.984
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just really hope that they don't try to do some stupid gimmick with this touchscreen thing, because...

01:06:51.864 --> 01:07:01.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't need another fucking gimmick from Nintendo I mean, let's just stop Nintendo is a fucking lazy company I'm sorry, they are a fucking lazy company And you know why?

01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:12.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they will take the least amount of effort to put out a new game I mean, they're porting old shit for the 3DS Okay, great, you're updating stuff Why don't you create a damn new game?

01:07:12.964 --> 01:07:14.706
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it in the same style as the old game

01:07:14.986 --> 01:07:20.910
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you did the same thing with, like, you know, the Wind Waker looking stuff on, you know, the DS.

01:07:22.491 --> 01:07:23.712
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, I guess, Wind Waker, yeah.

01:07:24.172 --> 01:07:30.957
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you did it, like, on the DS, but, you know, why can't you just create new games that look like the old games?

01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:34.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have to port the old games over?

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you don't want, you want to spend the least amount of time possible working on this shit.

01:07:39.303 --> 01:07:41.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people will buy it, no matter what you put out.

01:07:42.165 --> 01:07:44.786
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the least possible effort that they could put in a new console?

01:07:44.906 --> 01:07:45.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.

01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:48.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that takes the old games and makes them look new.

01:07:48.168 --> 01:07:49.128
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're going to do.

01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:52.570
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they could put out new games that look even nicer if they want.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:58.393
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, they don't have to do that much because they can just put out these low quality games and they upscale everything and it looks pretty.

01:07:58.573 --> 01:08:01.754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't think, but I don't, this is not going to be Wii 2.

01:08:02.135 --> 01:08:04.976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely not going to just be the Wii with enhanced graphics.

01:08:05.076 --> 01:08:05.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not.

01:08:05.696 --> 01:08:07.717
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a, there's a whole little follow up.

01:08:07.737 --> 01:08:08.918
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was, they should call it the Wii Wii.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:13.000
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a follow-up article to this where they actually said, they came out and said, what is this?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturo Wada comes out and says, quote, we would like to propose a new approach to home video game consoles.

01:08:20.683 --> 01:08:20.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

01:08:21.323 --> 01:08:21.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:08:21.823 --> 01:08:23.344
[SPEAKER_03]: A new approach to home video game consoles.

01:08:24.384 --> 01:08:26.065
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the Wii... Is the Facebook thing.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:26.846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:08:27.026 --> 01:08:30.087
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the Wii... But not actual Facebook, Nintendo book.

01:08:31.132 --> 01:08:36.456
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Wii, they were trying to get people that were non-gameplayers to play this console.

01:08:36.876 --> 01:08:46.623
[SPEAKER_03]: So were they going to try to... It's kind of hard, though, because now, were they going to try to bring... Oh my god, this would be hilarious.

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they'd be basically eating their own words.

01:08:50.566 --> 01:08:54.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out with something that was very similar to the iOS marketplace or something like that?

01:08:54.849 --> 01:08:58.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cheap-ass games, and this whole iPad-type thing.

01:08:58.351 --> 01:08:58.792
[SPEAKER_04]: DSiWare?

01:08:59.437 --> 01:09:07.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I understand that they have DSiWare, but, you know, I'm saying to the point where it's, you know, more than three releases a week or something like that.

01:09:07.299 --> 01:09:09.339
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just something ridiculous and very casual games.

01:09:10.199 --> 01:09:14.680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd laugh my ass off because, you know, oh, Apple, they're stupid, you know.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, then we're going to copy them.

01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:17.481
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:09:18.461 --> 01:09:21.381
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really pass judgment on it yet until we actually see what it is.

01:09:21.762 --> 01:09:24.342
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, you know, let me put it this way.

01:09:24.422 --> 01:09:28.023
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anything like the other Nintendo promises and stuff that we've seen...

01:09:28.883 --> 01:09:30.904
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is really eye-roll worthy.

01:09:30.964 --> 01:09:32.784
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, remember the Wii Zapper?

01:09:33.065 --> 01:09:34.465
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I go back to the Wii Zapper.

01:09:35.605 --> 01:09:38.667
[SPEAKER_03]: When they first showed it off, the prototype, it looked fucking badass.

01:09:38.727 --> 01:09:42.208
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, oh yeah, dude, that's the Zapper right there.

01:09:42.488 --> 01:09:47.190
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they came up with this plastic shell Zapper that looked like shit, I was like, what?

01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:50.471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your controller?

01:09:52.827 --> 01:10:00.092
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of which, are we ever going to get any other controllers that plug into the bottom of the goddamn Wii Remote?

01:10:00.472 --> 01:10:01.473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not.

01:10:01.773 --> 01:10:03.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're on a new console now.

01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:05.495
[SPEAKER_04]: So the answer is no, Loki, you're not.

01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:06.997
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer that for you.

01:10:07.017 --> 01:10:07.657
[SPEAKER_03]: All these promises.

01:10:07.677 --> 01:10:10.359
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:13.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you this, because obviously you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.

01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:15.342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why people love you or hate you.

01:10:16.843 --> 01:10:19.564
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet you own a 3DS and you've owned multiple 3DSs.

01:10:19.604 --> 01:10:20.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't play it.

01:10:20.785 --> 01:10:21.605
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know why I own it.

01:10:21.645 --> 01:10:22.645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not razzing you on it.

01:10:22.825 --> 01:10:33.009
[SPEAKER_04]: My true question for you is, what could Nintendo do at E3 with this console to make you go, okay, Nintendo, I misjudged you.

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:34.330
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the right track again.

01:10:35.049 --> 01:10:36.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Get with the times!

01:10:58.072 --> 01:11:03.419
[SPEAKER_03]: I need something a little bit more than just Oh look, new Mario game Oh look, another Mario Kart Oh look, another Zelda game

01:11:18.337 --> 01:11:19.899
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe make a new franchise.

01:11:20.019 --> 01:11:23.903
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been dealing with these old franchises for a long ass time.

01:11:24.264 --> 01:11:27.327
[SPEAKER_03]: How about creating the next good franchise?

01:11:27.487 --> 01:11:28.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe just...

01:11:29.548 --> 01:11:29.928
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:11:30.008 --> 01:11:48.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting a little bit more effort into something because if we put out another Zelda game or if they take Twilight Princess and make it look even prettier or something like that or like that one Zelda game that they were showing off that was Twilight Princess at one point and then they ended up scrapping that kind of look for the game because it's a dark Zelda game or something.

01:11:49.985 --> 01:11:50.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:11:50.345 --> 01:11:55.630
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want a little bit more than just Nintendo games and better graphics.

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:57.951
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:11:58.452 --> 01:11:58.512
[SPEAKER_03]: It

01:12:00.908 --> 01:12:03.271
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what they're offering.

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:04.512
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:12:04.752 --> 01:12:05.933
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sorry.

01:12:06.594 --> 01:12:10.878
[SPEAKER_03]: I know for a fact that I'm going to be laughing my ass off during this press conference.

01:12:11.899 --> 01:12:17.745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be... Because they have these really wacky ideas of what people want.

01:12:19.767 --> 01:12:22.690
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently it works for them, so I'm not going to fault them for it, but...

01:12:24.637 --> 01:12:52.158
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time there's consoles out there that I'm playing way more than we although to be fair my wife has gotten back to playing the Wii I did break my Wii for a little bit though and I had to fix it by swapping out the motherboard but you know and then we got back into playing some of the old Wii games that we liked like Excite Truck which Nintendo for the love of God just make another damn Excite Truck game do not make Excite Bots just another Excite Truck game with more tracks that'd make me happy

01:12:53.834 --> 01:12:54.775
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a new F-Zero?

01:12:54.835 --> 01:12:56.316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I asked for on last week's show.

01:12:56.356 --> 01:12:56.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, whatever.

01:12:58.078 --> 01:12:58.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Play Speed Racer.

01:12:58.998 --> 01:12:59.839
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much F-Zero.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.543
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, they just need to do that.

01:13:04.783 --> 01:13:05.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make...

01:13:06.587 --> 01:13:07.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, perfect example right there.

01:13:07.988 --> 01:13:08.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Excite Truck.

01:13:08.829 --> 01:13:14.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Launch Wii title, use some of the features of the Wii that like, you know, like, oh, SD memory card.

01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:15.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

01:13:15.314 --> 01:13:17.215
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play your own music off the SD memory card.

01:13:17.495 --> 01:13:18.496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really awesome.

01:13:18.716 --> 01:13:24.701
[SPEAKER_03]: It made that game so much more awesome because you can listen to your music while you're driving in this really awesome racing game.

01:13:25.061 --> 01:13:25.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequel comes out.

01:13:26.102 --> 01:13:26.722
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they do?

01:13:27.243 --> 01:13:27.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, guess what?

01:13:27.883 --> 01:13:29.184
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more mini games in there.

01:13:29.484 --> 01:13:31.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Mini games do not belong in a fucking racing game.

01:13:32.026 --> 01:13:32.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:13:58.241 --> 01:14:01.823
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that it's wacky and stuff, but it's not fucking Excite Truck.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.965
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what Nintendo needs to do to make you happy is stop making sandwiches.

01:14:04.985 --> 01:14:08.187
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to treat us like adults instead of just little kids.

01:14:08.227 --> 01:14:08.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it.

01:14:08.688 --> 01:14:10.809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people, yeah, I get it.

01:14:10.869 --> 01:14:14.051
[SPEAKER_03]: People like the party games on the Wii because, you know, Wii is kind of a social game.

01:14:14.091 --> 01:14:16.433
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't need to make every goddamn game a party game.

01:14:17.393 --> 01:14:20.335
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also don't need to make every damn game a family game.

01:14:20.535 --> 01:14:23.317
[SPEAKER_04]: What about this comment from Forbes111 in our chat, Loki?

01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:25.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they don't care about what you want.

01:14:25.098 --> 01:14:25.778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the money.

01:14:26.098 --> 01:14:26.598
[SPEAKER_06]: I retorted.

01:14:27.099 --> 01:14:28.920
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want the money, they need to care about what we want.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how well did Excite Trek sell?

01:14:32.622 --> 01:14:33.202
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very well.

01:14:34.423 --> 01:14:36.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why they didn't give you more of that.

01:14:36.464 --> 01:14:37.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't advertise the damn game.

01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.207
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an awesome game, and it's really underrated.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really sad that they... But here's the thing.

01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:45.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.

01:14:45.449 --> 01:14:48.731
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do what I want, but I don't have to buy your console either.

01:14:50.279 --> 01:14:50.859
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know what?

01:14:51.059 --> 01:14:56.282
[SPEAKER_03]: As consoles get more expensive and money gets tighter, I won't be buying every console that you put out.

01:14:57.003 --> 01:15:00.405
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the 3DS was pretty much an impulse buy and you know what?

01:15:00.485 --> 01:15:03.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of have some buyer's remorse over it because there weren't any...

01:15:05.094 --> 01:15:07.236
[SPEAKER_03]: There weren't any really must-have games at launch.

01:15:07.516 --> 01:15:08.036
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

01:15:08.076 --> 01:15:11.259
[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't really any must-have games in the next portion of the year.

01:15:11.419 --> 01:15:12.800
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I know Zelda's coming out.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:17.823
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I've said before, Ocarina of Time is the most overrated fucking game on the Nintendo system ever.

01:15:18.124 --> 01:15:18.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

01:15:18.844 --> 01:15:19.765
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

01:15:20.085 --> 01:15:21.586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying Ocarina of Time.

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:22.587
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's that leave me with?

01:15:24.346 --> 01:15:26.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking nothing, because there's nothing coming out.

01:15:26.507 --> 01:15:27.087
[SPEAKER_03]: So, great.

01:15:27.107 --> 01:15:27.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus?

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:28.487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Kid Icarus.

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:28.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

01:15:29.488 --> 01:15:34.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I'll enjoy my three games for the next nine months or whatever it's going to take for Kid Icarus to come out.

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:36.790
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's it.

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:40.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Netflix 3D, that's what I'm looking forward to.

01:15:40.052 --> 01:15:43.313
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what they bring to the table at E3.

01:15:43.753 --> 01:15:46.834
[SPEAKER_03]: But just remember this, and another thing.

01:15:47.274 --> 01:15:49.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the other thing that'll make me happy, Nintendo.

01:15:49.935 --> 01:15:50.415
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:16:19.772 --> 01:16:24.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce is being sued because, God, we love lawsuits this week.

01:16:24.836 --> 01:16:26.197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we seem to be reporting on.

01:16:26.577 --> 01:16:29.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce got sued for $100 million.

01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:30.900
[SPEAKER_04]: She probably has it.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce, even though her new single is terrible, just saying.

01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:38.085
[SPEAKER_04]: But Beyonce has been sued for $100 million from Gate 5.

01:16:38.505 --> 01:16:39.646
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is she being sued?

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:48.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's because the singer made this huge demand for more money during a crucial moment in the production of a game called Star Power Beyonce.

01:16:49.532 --> 01:16:49.893
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:16:49.933 --> 01:16:52.174
[SPEAKER_04]: They were making a game called Star Power Beyonce.

01:16:52.234 --> 01:16:53.976
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what this game would have been.

01:16:54.056 --> 01:16:57.438
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine it must be like the Michael Jackson experience or something.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:57.759
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.000
[SPEAKER_06]: She shoots stars out of her cooch.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:04.464
[SPEAKER_04]: A music game that involves Beyonce where you could do the single ladies dance in the privacy of your own home.

01:17:04.744 --> 01:17:05.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your hands up.

01:17:06.525 --> 01:17:15.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Gate 5 says we are entitled to the $6.7 million that we invested and the $100 million in profits that we would have made.

01:17:16.008 --> 01:17:22.550
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to let 70 employees go right at the Christmas season because of what Beyonce did.

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:23.230
[SPEAKER_04]: What a Grinch.

01:17:25.035 --> 01:17:37.459
[SPEAKER_04]: and they want an injunction against Beyonce from commercially associating with any other video game or using confidential information that she got when she was working with the company.

01:17:39.031 --> 01:17:39.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:18:00.874 --> 01:18:02.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe her people did, her entourage.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:03.475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:18:03.495 --> 01:18:06.236
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jay-Z sat with her in those meetings.

01:18:06.276 --> 01:18:06.916
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:18:06.936 --> 01:18:10.157
[SPEAKER_06]: We now have a discussion going about people buying Beyonce cooch stars.

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:13.458
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I would rather buy Gaga cooch stars.

01:18:14.219 --> 01:18:16.479
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't buy... How about all cooch stars?

01:18:16.539 --> 01:18:18.320
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get all the crazy ladies.

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:19.600
[SPEAKER_03]: A Beyonce game sounds dumb.

01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:20.481
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

01:18:20.621 --> 01:18:20.961
[SPEAKER_03]: It just...

01:18:21.481 --> 01:18:22.262
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have made money.

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:25.764
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it wouldn't be like the biggest video game ever, but it would have made money.

01:18:25.804 --> 01:18:26.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

01:18:26.365 --> 01:18:35.912
[SPEAKER_03]: $100 million, I mean, that's way more than... If they were going to spend $100 million, or they spent $100 million on this game... No, they think $100 million is what they lost.

01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:37.753
[SPEAKER_04]: They lost... Oh, come on!

01:18:38.554 --> 01:18:41.576
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have never made $100 million on this game.

01:18:42.096 --> 01:18:44.838
[SPEAKER_03]: That would require them selling... Let's just say it's a $50 retail game...

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.662
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just say that it's all pure profit.

01:18:49.762 --> 01:18:53.545
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because this is never going to, I mean, it would be way more than that.

01:18:53.565 --> 01:18:56.928
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have to sell more than 2 million copies of this game to make their money back.

01:18:57.308 --> 01:19:02.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming that they were getting all of the money from the actual game sale, which they're not.

01:19:02.352 --> 01:19:06.095
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they're saying that this game would have sold over 2 million copies.

01:19:06.235 --> 01:19:07.896
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have not sold over 2 million copies.

01:19:07.936 --> 01:19:12.019
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have sold 200,000 copies at the most.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.461
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would have had to fire people anyway.

01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:16.603
[SPEAKER_03]: So who cares?

01:19:20.664 --> 01:19:26.468
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news, and then we're going to get to the release dates here in a little bit.

01:19:27.048 --> 01:19:31.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to keep the show moving right along in what was a pretty hefty news week.

01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:36.734
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's going to be lots of phone calls tonight, so I want to keep some time open in Part B. So it's my turn?

01:19:36.914 --> 01:19:37.794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, it's your turn.

01:19:38.495 --> 01:19:39.115
[SPEAKER_04]: Tron!

01:19:39.595 --> 01:19:40.976
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to do the single ladies dance.

01:19:41.516 --> 01:19:41.677
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:19:41.937 --> 01:19:42.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:19:43.755 --> 01:19:44.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Tron!

01:19:45.116 --> 01:19:46.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what about Tron?

01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:48.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinball!

01:19:48.498 --> 01:19:50.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, happy, happy, happy, happy.

01:19:51.079 --> 01:19:56.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I showed this to Dan, and he's like, what pinball tables can we get rid of to get this?

01:19:57.382 --> 01:19:58.223
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually thinking that.

01:19:58.263 --> 01:20:00.944
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, which pinball tables are you going to sell to buy the Tron pinball?

01:20:02.425 --> 01:20:06.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, three of our tables would equal the cost of this, which is the problem.

01:20:06.327 --> 01:20:07.067
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:20:07.267 --> 01:20:08.108
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should do it.

01:20:09.449 --> 01:20:11.970
[SPEAKER_06]: If it were my choice, I'd get rid of Lord of the Rings, but Dan loves that table, so...

01:20:12.409 --> 01:20:17.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, yeah, Stern, which is like the only company doing tables anymore, is putting out Tron.

01:20:18.571 --> 01:20:31.336
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of doing just their usual teaser of the cabinet art, they've actually got the whole play field out, which I'm going to go ahead and link an image in the chat room for them to look at.

01:20:31.856 --> 01:20:34.317
[SPEAKER_06]: But the pictures are up at arcadeheroes.com.

01:20:34.437 --> 01:20:36.018
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually looking really good.

01:20:36.638 --> 01:20:37.118
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got...

01:20:38.859 --> 01:20:44.141
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D models in there, the light cycles, little figures in the back, plenty of ramps, plenty of lights.

01:20:45.201 --> 01:20:59.727
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're actually talking about doing a potentially limited edition where they might have something other than just those monochrome LED backgrounds.

01:21:00.087 --> 01:21:01.908
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's still kind of speculation.

01:21:04.769 --> 01:21:10.571
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool, but the back glass is supposed to have the 3D parallax effect that's the same on the Avatar pinball.

01:21:11.352 --> 01:21:15.394
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be out sometime this month with a limited edition in June.

01:21:16.374 --> 01:21:20.836
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks sick, and hopefully California Extreme will have one for us to play.

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.117
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they had Iron Man last year.

01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:24.418
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh...

01:21:25.818 --> 01:21:30.659
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, one of the other tables that Stern's doing, by the way, is the Rolling Stones, but it's like a $6,000 table.

01:21:30.799 --> 01:21:31.599
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much is that table?

01:21:31.819 --> 01:21:34.280
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's going to be about $4,000, $4,500, something like that.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:34.980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not bad.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:48.283
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, Stern pretty much, and this is the problem I have with this, is that now that we don't have Williams and Midway doing tables anymore and Capcom's out of the game, Stern's really the only company there is.

01:21:49.683 --> 01:21:50.604
[SPEAKER_03]: They can charge what they want.

01:21:50.724 --> 01:21:57.290
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the Williams Collection coming out on the 3DS in June, I think.

01:21:57.951 --> 01:21:58.652
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

01:21:59.312 --> 01:22:00.693
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the Williams Tables.

01:22:00.914 --> 01:22:04.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that game has been re-released so many damn times by Crave.

01:22:05.958 --> 01:22:08.521
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Crave closed down, but they're still making games.

01:22:10.162 --> 01:22:10.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Porting games.

01:22:12.905 --> 01:22:13.225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:22:16.396 --> 01:22:17.076
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is my thing.

01:22:17.377 --> 01:22:21.281
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I love video pinball, nothing compares to the real thing.

01:22:22.442 --> 01:22:29.749
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would almost always go out and hunt down a good pinball table than have... So you wouldn't be interested in a pin maim table?

01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:32.171
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a pin maim.

01:22:32.552 --> 01:22:33.172
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

01:22:33.793 --> 01:22:36.215
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun, but not my thing.

01:22:37.756 --> 01:23:04.183
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll tell you what I did because a few years ago they had one at California Extreme and right next to it was a Black Knight 2000 and I played Black Knight 2000 on the pin maim and then I played Black Knight 2000 on the real thing and it's just you just can't get the same feel it's a very good simulacrum I mean pin maim itself is very well done but it's just not the same

01:23:05.153 --> 01:23:30.053
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go ahead, I can't remember very often in the history of our show that we do this but there is a real world that goes on out there outside of us and not just what's happening in the world of video games and if you are all about 100% video games I do encourage you to go outside once in a while but needless to say there's a lot going on in the real world right now they are saying that President Obama is scheduled to address the nation any minute now I guess it's supposed to happen at 10.30 Eastern but it's running a little late

01:23:31.194 --> 01:23:50.488
[SPEAKER_04]: I take this with a grain of salt we'll find out in the next few minutes I'm looking at what is usually a pretty respectable source it does sound like Osama Bin Laden is dead and the US has the body and that's what Obama is expected to announce in the next few minutes that is not confirmed I'm getting that from a source that's usually pretty right on about these things

01:23:51.268 --> 01:23:52.089
[SPEAKER_04]: So more to develop.

01:23:52.109 --> 01:23:57.951
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do encourage you, if you are listening to the show, you might just want to keep CNN open in another tab and furiously hit refresh on that.

01:23:57.971 --> 01:24:03.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if that is the news, that's obviously going to have people talking about more than just games for quite some time.

01:24:04.274 --> 01:24:09.596
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he invites in the guy from the announcer from NBA Jam.

01:24:09.696 --> 01:24:11.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom shakalaka!

01:24:12.378 --> 01:24:18.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you, by the way, not meaning to really derail so much, but did you see the White House correspondent speech?

01:24:18.627 --> 01:24:18.987
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:20.029
[SPEAKER_06]: That was brilliant.

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:20.990
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:21.911
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that man.

01:24:22.272 --> 01:24:22.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time.

01:24:23.053 --> 01:24:24.195
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I voted for him.

01:24:25.256 --> 01:24:26.358
[SPEAKER_06]: His sense of humor is amazing.

01:24:27.272 --> 01:24:46.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, again, I just know where to look for information and rumors that are usually right on Hold on, hold on Let me just put a funny, maybe morbid image in your face Wouldn't it be hilarious if they just pulled a whole fucking Weekend at Bernie's Oh, stop it

01:24:46.743 --> 01:24:49.304
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Hassan Bin Laden waving his hand.

01:24:50.204 --> 01:24:51.065
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

01:24:51.705 --> 01:24:52.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

01:24:52.265 --> 01:24:52.685
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:59.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby actually gave me the original tip on that, so thank you, Bobby, who told me to go look at CNN, and that made me think to go check my tweet.

01:24:59.267 --> 01:25:08.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, again, not official, but my guy on Twitter who tends to be on top of this stuff is rolling out all these sources that seem to point to that being the case.

01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:10.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that would be interesting.

01:25:10.771 --> 01:25:13.433
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be extremely interesting, to say the least.

01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:20.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the show must go on as they say, but I do know we live in a multitask world, so those of you listening live may wish to alt-tab to CNN.

01:25:21.377 --> 01:25:24.179
[SPEAKER_04]: But please don't turn us off.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.702
[SPEAKER_04]: If they confirm it or whatever it is, I will relay it for you guys.

01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:30.683
[SPEAKER_06]: How about I keep the website up and I'll keep an eye on it?

01:25:30.743 --> 01:25:30.983
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:25:31.303 --> 01:25:32.384
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:37.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, let's talk about release dates and what is coming soon to a gaming store near you.

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:47.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, these games may not be able to be played by Osama Bin Laden very soon, but coming next week, Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska for the Nintendo Wii.

01:25:47.474 --> 01:25:52.898
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like your hunting, and you like your Alaska hunting, and you like your Sarah Palin, but she's not in the game.

01:25:53.939 --> 01:25:56.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't hunt her either, so I don't know.

01:25:56.641 --> 01:25:59.163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's budget price, so I guess that might be good.

01:26:00.584 --> 01:26:04.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Thor, God of Thunder, or God of Movie Titan Game.

01:26:04.227 --> 01:26:06.629
[SPEAKER_03]: That is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and

01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:11.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii, DS, and that's it.

01:26:12.413 --> 01:26:13.434
[SPEAKER_03]: No 3DS, unfortunately.

01:26:13.454 --> 01:26:14.074
[SPEAKER_03]: That got delayed.

01:26:14.915 --> 01:26:17.476
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think it'd be easy to port over.

01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:29.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the game that I've been highly raving about, and I, sadly enough, haven't been playing much of it lately, just for no reason whatsoever, but Motorstorm Apocalypse, coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:26:29.905 --> 01:26:36.809
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like racing games and you like crazy destruction and just all sorts of insane stuff going on while you're racing,

01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:39.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, go pick this game up.

01:26:39.313 --> 01:26:40.656
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just amazing.

01:26:41.398 --> 01:26:42.821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:47.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, that is it.

01:26:48.849 --> 01:26:49.489
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all.

01:26:50.370 --> 01:26:54.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff for the rest of May, though, but just unfortunately next week is a little light.

01:26:54.111 --> 01:26:57.232
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some other highlights in May, just so I know what I should be looking at?

01:26:57.332 --> 01:27:03.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in two weeks, we have Brink, which is going to be an awesome first-person shooter from Bethesda.

01:27:03.794 --> 01:27:04.494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out.

01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:07.755
[SPEAKER_03]: Lego Pirates, if you're into that kind of thing.

01:27:08.695 --> 01:27:10.756
[SPEAKER_03]: MX vs. HV Alive, if you like that.

01:27:11.256 --> 01:27:13.497
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two weeks, the game I'm looking forward to, L.A.

01:27:13.817 --> 01:27:15.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire from Rockstar Games coming out.

01:27:15.818 --> 01:27:17.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's quite a few people looking forward to that.

01:27:17.618 --> 01:27:18.779
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be awesome.

01:27:19.019 --> 01:27:29.747
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, towards the end of the month, if you're a big fan of racing, Dirt 3 coming out and Hunt of the Demon's Forge if you're into those types of games.

01:27:30.587 --> 01:27:36.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, actually a lot of stuff that was supposed to be coming out in the month, Fear 3, Dungeon Siege 3, and Red Faction all got delayed to June.

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:40.154
[SPEAKER_03]: But Red Faction looks pretty good too, although it's kind of got a Dead Space vibe.

01:27:41.114 --> 01:27:41.515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:27:42.755 --> 01:27:44.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really feeling Dead Space, so...

01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:45.378
[SPEAKER_03]: but L.A.

01:27:45.438 --> 01:27:49.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire looks awesome so that's probably the next game I'll pick up and maybe Brink.

01:27:49.305 --> 01:27:50.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Brink looks pretty cool too.

01:27:51.343 --> 01:27:53.203
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:28:16.283 --> 01:28:43.535
[SPEAKER_04]: there is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week that's it that's the releases May 12th, Steel Diver on the 3DS which we've had here obviously since release Major League Baseball on the 12th but as far as the 5th which the games are usually out on Fridays nothing wow it could be that all that's going on in the world as far as Japan is maybe shuffled some things up I mean it's, don't know

01:28:43.837 --> 01:28:44.237
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly.

01:28:44.697 --> 01:28:46.318
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a few releases for the UK.

01:28:47.058 --> 01:28:49.799
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 4th is Bangaio HD Missile Fury for Xbox 360.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.000
[SPEAKER_06]: Bangaio is so much fun.

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.501
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's Section 8 Prejudice for PC.

01:28:55.121 --> 01:29:01.443
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the 6th is Sniper Ghost Warriors, Steel Diver, and Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011.

01:29:01.623 --> 01:29:03.184
[SPEAKER_06]: Eww.

01:29:05.205 --> 01:29:06.065
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I say about that.

01:29:08.715 --> 01:29:10.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, so much for release dates.

01:29:10.596 --> 01:29:12.616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking a little dry no matter what part of the world you're in.

01:29:13.096 --> 01:29:13.977
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go to Loki.

01:29:14.497 --> 01:29:21.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, there's some interest... Oh my god, the chat room is yelling at me because I said the release dates are looking pretty dry in Japan.

01:29:21.859 --> 01:29:23.760
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are dummies.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.282
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that with love, but seriously.

01:29:26.602 --> 01:29:27.122
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

01:29:28.204 --> 01:29:32.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony revealed two new tablet devices that are going to be part of the PlayStation suite.

01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:40.395
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, I guess they're officially the S1 and S2 tablets, which...

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:43.677
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30:04.568 --> 01:30:09.751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dual screen tablet and people are saying it looks like the DS.

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:13.893
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can run two different things at the same time.

01:30:13.933 --> 01:30:21.178
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch a video and chat at the same time on the other screen or use the other screen as a soft keyboard and whatever.

01:30:21.778 --> 01:30:28.962
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're two 5.5 inch screens and both of course will be able to play select PlayStation 1 games.

01:30:29.162 --> 01:30:29.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangible buttons?

01:30:30.323 --> 01:30:31.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, couldn't care less.

01:30:31.804 --> 01:30:32.365
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:36.830
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm not interested unless they were to have tangible buttons.

01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:41.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine playing a PlayStation 1 game on your iPhone?

01:30:41.555 --> 01:30:43.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what this is, basically.

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:45.839
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:47.802
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:30:48.903 --> 01:30:51.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

01:30:51.865 --> 01:30:56.409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also kind of a follow-up because last week in the middle of the show, some details were breaking on it.

01:30:56.449 --> 01:30:57.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess it was really that day.

01:30:58.190 --> 01:31:00.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantasy Star Online 2 details.

01:31:00.953 --> 01:31:03.335
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting some more information on what that was all about.

01:31:03.855 --> 01:31:09.480
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a PSP2 promotion event that was in Akihabara over last week.

01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:10.240
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

01:31:11.461 --> 01:31:15.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, there was more information released on Phantasy Star Online 2.

01:31:17.264 --> 01:31:19.664
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently now you're going to be able to jump in the game.

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:27.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, randomly generated hunting areas, some third-person shooter-style gameplay, and so on.

01:31:27.528 --> 01:31:29.128
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're adding jumping into it.

01:31:29.168 --> 01:31:31.569
[SPEAKER_04]: That could certainly make the levels different.

01:31:31.969 --> 01:31:33.230
[SPEAKER_04]: Randomly generated hunting areas.

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:35.271
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I seem to remember the levels in the old...

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:38.312
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just said National Journal learned it's true

01:32:05.316 --> 01:32:10.439
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, yeah, according to MSNBC, their same president will make a statement soon regarding Osama bin Laden.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:14.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Fox News saying it, New York Times is saying it, so it looks like, there you go.

01:32:15.383 --> 01:32:15.643
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:32:15.903 --> 01:32:16.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

01:32:16.924 --> 01:32:20.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to, again, keep CNN open in another tab.

01:32:21.407 --> 01:32:22.768
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, if you're listening to the show.

01:32:23.108 --> 01:32:27.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever, I say CNN, but whatever your website of choice is, okay, kids?

01:32:27.651 --> 01:32:29.552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, tell us about what is the classic game of the week.

01:32:53.564 --> 01:32:57.666
[SPEAKER_06]: The game of the week is Afterburner, which came out in 1987.

01:32:57.766 --> 01:33:01.348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a flight sim arcade game put out by Sega.

01:33:01.948 --> 01:33:06.511
[SPEAKER_06]: It had full motion seats, at least for the deluxe cabinet.

01:33:06.951 --> 01:33:09.532
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also designed by Yu Suzuki, who is the man!

01:33:10.813 --> 01:33:20.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, you control an F-14 Tomcat, and you go through 18 stages, and you take off from an aircraft character called the Sega Enterprise.

01:33:20.958 --> 01:33:46.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is an homage to Top Gun and not Star Trek And so it had basically an integrated flight stick That would control the way the cabinet moved either back and forth And it had hydraulics in it And it would have cannon and missile buttons It was also a standing upright one But the rotating cockpit one was the awesome one

01:33:47.632 --> 01:33:53.198
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, it was, I mean, basically it's just straightforward.

01:33:53.338 --> 01:34:01.266
[SPEAKER_06]: You shoot down planes and you have like a lock for your missiles and you can shoot them down and you choose, you know, your direction.

01:34:01.346 --> 01:34:04.809
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also After Burner 2, which was a sequel that was put out the same year.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:34.135
[SPEAKER_06]: and then there were other games that focused on the F-14 Tomcat like G-Lock Air Battle and Strike Fighter that was actually rebranded as After Burner 3 and then Sky Target there was also Sega Strike Fighter which was a free roaming type of F-14 game and then we got After Burner Climax which is the one that I played just this week that's really sweet there's also a PSP release called After Burner Black Falcon

01:34:35.478 --> 01:34:39.875
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually some of the music in this was remixed for Bayonetta.

01:34:41.388 --> 01:34:41.968
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:55.254
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as other versions that have been out, there was Amiga, the Amstrad, the Atari ST, Sharp X68000, FM Towns, Commodore 64, NES, Sega Master System, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, PC, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.

01:34:55.895 --> 01:35:02.158
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was a 32X version that was called Afterburner Complete in Japan and Europe.

01:35:02.378 --> 01:35:04.059
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you what's cool about that.

01:35:04.099 --> 01:35:06.760
[SPEAKER_06]: It also is the same for Space Harrier on 32X.

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:08.941
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the arcade version, the full arcade version.

01:35:09.341 --> 01:35:11.745
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually do a little trick to make it say insert coin.

01:35:13.027 --> 01:35:15.130
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so it's kind of neat.

01:35:15.190 --> 01:35:16.432
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much the same ROM.

01:35:17.153 --> 01:35:25.105
[SPEAKER_06]: And the little article here has a few other bits and pieces, like in Terminator 2 Judgment Day, John Connor's playing Afterburner.

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:28.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

01:35:28.383 --> 01:35:29.064
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

01:35:29.104 --> 01:35:29.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he is.

01:35:30.246 --> 01:35:34.831
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Red Dwarf, seasons two and three, there was an afterburner in the bar area.

01:35:36.834 --> 01:35:38.436
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty cool.

01:35:39.217 --> 01:35:39.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:35:40.499 --> 01:35:41.580
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the music in this game.

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.403
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really surprised you've never done afterburner before.

01:35:45.498 --> 01:35:48.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and After Burner, I have to say, is not one of my favorite games.

01:35:49.541 --> 01:35:51.122
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love After Burner Climax.

01:35:51.182 --> 01:35:52.083
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the cabinet.

01:35:52.523 --> 01:35:53.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the cabinet.

01:35:53.524 --> 01:36:00.249
[SPEAKER_06]: After Burner Climax actually has the full-on hydraulic seats that has front, back, side, up, down motion.

01:36:00.429 --> 01:36:02.571
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's super, super fun.

01:36:02.911 --> 01:36:07.254
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that was really great about these is that they did include a motion stop.

01:36:07.354 --> 01:36:09.956
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you couldn't take it, it would just stop the movement.

01:36:10.656 --> 01:36:11.277
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

01:36:11.717 --> 01:36:12.718
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, After Burner...

01:36:14.429 --> 01:36:19.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, everybody, Afterburner.

01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:24.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Best known in its arcade release, but certainly ported to plenty of home consoles.

01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:28.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:29.180
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.541
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be right back with plenty more of the show tonight.

01:36:32.322 --> 01:36:35.923
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking a lot about PlayStation, but there's been big news on Xbox this week as well.

01:36:35.943 --> 01:36:37.404
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk about that as well.

01:36:37.844 --> 01:36:39.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 3DS news as well.

01:36:39.345 --> 01:36:40.866
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki's going to bring us some hacking news.

01:36:41.346 --> 01:36:44.788
[SPEAKER_04]: All when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:53.742 --> 01:37:07.374
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this Sunday evening, May the 1st of 2011, with the 411th episode of our show, where we're giving you not just the 411 on what's going on with PSN and all that stuff, but apparently what's going on in the real world as well.

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:17.883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite an exciting evening, but in the interest of those that are... We'll keep you abreast if anything huge develops, but in the interest of those that listen to the podcast throughout the week, by the time this will be...

01:37:20.045 --> 01:37:27.088
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one little announcement that's going to be closer to 11.30 Central Time that the announcement will be made.

01:37:27.108 --> 01:37:28.569
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still working on final statements.

01:37:28.969 --> 01:37:29.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:35.953
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything's set up, so that will be 9.30 Pacific for our live listeners.

01:37:36.333 --> 01:37:36.593
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:37:36.913 --> 01:37:38.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on, though, with the show.

01:37:38.414 --> 01:37:43.617
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get back into video games, especially out of the interest of those that listen to the show throughout the week by the time this will be long reported on.

01:37:44.077 --> 01:37:45.299
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to name my firstborn Wolf.

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:46.841
[SPEAKER_04]: After Wolf Blitzer?

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:49.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because Wolf was a freaking badass name.

01:37:49.384 --> 01:37:51.867
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the name of the dog that played piano on the Muppets?

01:37:51.887 --> 01:37:52.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that Ralph?

01:37:52.488 --> 01:37:52.729
[SPEAKER_04]: Ralph.

01:37:52.869 --> 01:37:53.329
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

01:37:53.449 --> 01:37:53.970
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Wolf.

01:37:55.172 --> 01:37:56.373
[SPEAKER_04]: How about, what if you have twins?

01:37:56.413 --> 01:37:57.314
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you have Wolf and Ralph?

01:37:58.796 --> 01:38:00.478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have Wolf and...

01:38:02.398 --> 01:38:03.198
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolf and Fox.

01:38:03.539 --> 01:38:03.799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:38:04.279 --> 01:38:05.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on back into the show.

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:07.440
[SPEAKER_04]: First, spin-off shows.

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.322
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Orange Launch Radio, there's some other shows you might like as well.

01:38:11.142 --> 01:38:11.642
[SPEAKER_04]: I do one.

01:38:11.742 --> 01:38:13.983
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

01:38:14.283 --> 01:38:16.064
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a show about all things World of Warcraft.

01:38:16.084 --> 01:38:16.904
[SPEAKER_04]: This week was a fun week.

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.165
[SPEAKER_04]: It was our international edition.

01:38:18.465 --> 01:38:24.668
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this gal, Syl, from the Girls Gone Wow podcast, and she is a Dutch lady living in the U.K.

01:38:25.328 --> 01:38:27.869
[SPEAKER_04]: She's Southwest, I think Southwest part of the U.K.

01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:29.430
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you use the underwear picture.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.762
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:38:45.816 --> 01:38:46.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcane is awesome!

01:39:11.476 --> 01:39:11.737
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:39:12.037 --> 01:39:15.259
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, you want to hear more WoW geekery, check it out, HordeHouse.com.

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.540
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you got a show.

01:39:16.841 --> 01:39:24.947
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it Comic Insanity, although we haven't done one for a month now because we've just had a lot of stuff going on and the world of comics is not that much exciting.

01:39:25.007 --> 01:39:29.110
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can find us at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:32.092
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should have a new one, I think, next week.

01:39:32.252 --> 01:39:36.035
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep your eyes open on the website.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:36.556
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pretty cool.

01:39:36.576 --> 01:39:39.678
[SPEAKER_06]: I do it with Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

01:39:40.895 --> 01:39:41.884
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're cool!

01:39:43.346 --> 01:39:43.726
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:39:44.047 --> 01:39:45.248
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually came back this week?

01:39:45.968 --> 01:39:47.770
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we didn't because she's in Disneyland.

01:39:48.791 --> 01:39:49.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

01:39:49.792 --> 01:39:50.212
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going.

01:39:50.292 --> 01:39:52.114
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean that babe in total control of herself.

01:39:52.134 --> 01:39:52.654
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going.

01:39:52.734 --> 01:39:52.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:39:53.034 --> 01:39:55.096
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's for her birthday.

01:39:55.316 --> 01:40:00.841
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about this how openly, but there's like this awesome Disneyland trip happening very soon.

01:40:00.941 --> 01:40:02.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not very soon, but soon.

01:40:02.602 --> 01:40:05.305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to involve at least one other person not in this room.

01:40:05.805 --> 01:40:06.906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be epic epicness.

01:40:07.827 --> 01:40:09.348
[SPEAKER_04]: So more to come on that later.

01:40:09.889 --> 01:40:10.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.830
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:12.211
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing?

01:40:13.252 --> 01:40:13.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:40:28.775 --> 01:40:29.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:40:29.596 --> 01:40:29.876
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:40:30.016 --> 01:40:32.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we wouldn't be announcing it if we didn't do it ourselves.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.383
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd say, yeah, those guys in the UK.

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:42.649
[SPEAKER_04]: We can end the show early if you guys just want to focus on this.

01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:49.997
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I realize it's important news, but I'm worried about the podcasties listening throughout the week who have probably heard this a million times by now.

01:40:50.337 --> 01:40:50.558
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:41:00.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Redbox is now finally rolling out game rentals for all of their kiosks.

01:41:00.726 --> 01:41:01.967
[SPEAKER_03]: $21,000 to be exact.

01:41:02.007 --> 01:41:04.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not exact, but I guess that's kind of an estimate.

01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting June 17th.

01:41:08.453 --> 01:41:10.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Those rentals will run you $2 a day.

01:41:11.175 --> 01:41:17.200
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be, I guess, including some of the top AAA games and some family games as well.

01:41:19.383 --> 01:41:20.364
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's pretty awesome.

01:41:20.444 --> 01:41:30.571
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking for another place to rent games, and maybe just game flies and getting stuff to you quick enough, you can check out a Redbox machine, which are everywhere now.

01:41:32.792 --> 01:41:43.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Smiles 2X has been rated by the ESRB, and of course, we can probably expect that on the Xbox 360 Marketplace very soon.

01:41:43.339 --> 01:41:48.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they've been putting a lot of other cave shmup games on there, so...

01:41:50.268 --> 01:41:50.648
[SPEAKER_03]: E.A.

01:41:50.668 --> 01:41:51.789
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackbox is the one doing the game.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:46.583
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're saying that apparently it will be kind of a cross country cannonball run style game from San Francisco to New York and not only will you be racing against police and what not but you'll also be racing through dense urban traffic, icy mountain passes and narrow canyons so kind of a little bit of you versus the elements versus police and stuff so sounds pretty chaotic, might be fun and that'll be coming out this fall

01:42:48.254 --> 01:42:51.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did you hear the one about Marshfield, Massachusetts?

01:42:51.257 --> 01:42:52.417
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're probably like, what?

01:42:52.618 --> 01:42:53.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you live there.

01:42:54.179 --> 01:43:01.605
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1982, they actually banned arcade games from public establishments.

01:43:01.945 --> 01:43:02.346
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:43:02.386 --> 01:43:07.030
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to have a coin-op game in an establishment in Marshfield, Massachusetts.

01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:08.651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Footloose for video games.

01:43:09.292 --> 01:43:09.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

01:43:10.352 --> 01:43:15.797
[SPEAKER_04]: The law was actually upheld once by the state Supreme Court the next year, and it's always been in place since then.

01:43:16.638 --> 01:43:24.764
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they might actually be, and the reason why this is relevant now, 29 years later, is that they are looking at possibly reversing that law.

01:43:25.605 --> 01:43:32.371
[SPEAKER_04]: State law actually permits Keno to be allowed in bars and other buildings, so what the hell's wrong with coin-op games existing?

01:43:32.951 --> 01:43:59.181
[SPEAKER_04]: the town meeting is happening this next week and voters will be able to overturn the law so it'll be up to the voters so if you know anyone there you probably want to get them to vote to overturn this law although at the same time I suppose if they've gotten by for 29 years without coin-op games in town they'll probably get by another 29 there's also that part of me that says what coin-op games because you know outside of the Tron pinball news we had earlier there's not a lot of games going on

01:43:59.841 --> 01:44:04.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, a game that's rumored to be coming out on the Kinect, Fruit Ninja.

01:44:04.143 --> 01:44:07.764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very popular game, of course, on the iPhone and iPad devices.

01:44:08.184 --> 01:44:12.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit Ninja Kinect is apparently a game that's just recently been rated in Korea.

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:15.727
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not usually the country we get our rating board leaks from, but...

01:44:16.427 --> 01:44:17.007
[SPEAKER_04]: It is what it is.

01:44:17.127 --> 01:44:21.988
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit Ninja Connect has been leaked as a rated game in Korea.

01:44:23.008 --> 01:44:25.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they don't say what system this is for.

01:44:25.569 --> 01:44:31.330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the 360, but they don't say if it's a disc game or an Xbox Live Arcade game or how it's being delivered.

01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:39.852
[SPEAKER_04]: My assumption is that it's going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game just based on what the source material is, but we won't know for a little while.

01:44:41.112 --> 01:44:43.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one other piece of the thing came to light this week.

01:44:43.693 --> 01:44:50.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there was a Sonic skateboarding game that went unreleased during the Xbox era.

01:44:51.457 --> 01:44:56.219
[SPEAKER_04]: It was discovered by a post on the Sonic Retro fan site at sonicretro.org.

01:44:57.239 --> 01:44:58.120
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:45:27.217 --> 01:45:30.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to some more rapid fire news.

01:45:30.493 --> 01:45:31.016
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

01:45:33.908 --> 01:45:37.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have some news for fans of Black Ops.

01:45:37.930 --> 01:45:46.776
[SPEAKER_06]: There is going to be a download content pack called Call of the Dead that has George Romero as himself.

01:45:47.836 --> 01:45:51.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's lots of zombie fan service.

01:45:51.419 --> 01:45:54.841
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be making the dead go splat.

01:45:56.202 --> 01:45:58.523
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be pretty neat.

01:46:00.237 --> 01:46:05.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have BlazBlue shirts that are going for Japan relief.

01:46:06.842 --> 01:46:12.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Axis Games has everything on sale and I will put a link to that in the chat room.

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:20.332
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to do your part, go to AxisGames.com slash 2011 slash 03 slash 16 slash Japan dash benefit dash sale.

01:46:20.632 --> 01:46:25.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can probably find a link from the website, but I am being nice and telling you the whole thing.

01:46:26.336 --> 01:46:33.118
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Rock Band has some cool bean stuff coming up including some Culture Club downloads.

01:46:33.798 --> 01:46:36.319
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me get what's on the list for you.

01:46:37.379 --> 01:46:39.620
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be of course Xbox 360, Wii and PS3.

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:54.945
[SPEAKER_06]: The individual songs are going to be Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, From Out of Nowhere by Faith No More, Working for the Weekend by Loverboy, Stashed by Fish, Tweezer by Fish and Big Bang Baby by Stone Temple Pilots.

01:46:56.166 --> 01:47:01.734
[SPEAKER_06]: and that last one and Working for the Weekend also have pro guitar bass expansions available.

01:47:02.235 --> 01:47:03.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and so does Stashed by Phish.

01:47:04.078 --> 01:47:04.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Phish is cool.

01:47:05.981 --> 01:47:07.083
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yay.

01:47:09.528 --> 01:47:09.888
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:47:10.549 --> 01:47:14.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick to kind of add on a little bit what you were saying about the Call of Duty expansion.

01:47:15.092 --> 01:47:22.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does it have George Romero, he is playing this crazy uber zombie in it, but it also has Sarah Jessica Parker.

01:47:22.797 --> 01:47:23.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah Michelle Gellar.

01:47:23.778 --> 01:47:24.158
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

01:47:24.178 --> 01:47:27.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be, that's way better than Sarah Michelle Parker.

01:47:28.981 --> 01:47:32.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah Jessica Parker would probably, she'd be like a plastic zombie.

01:47:32.423 --> 01:47:33.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a plastic zombie.

01:47:33.544 --> 01:47:38.027
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Michael Rooker, Danny Trejo, and Robert England,

01:47:39.948 --> 01:48:03.253
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah all kind of almost like playing themselves you know like they've got you know Robert Englund has kind of like some catchphrases that sort of you know hint at you know Nightmare on Elm Street and he has a pitchfork and then Danny Trejo has a machete and Microworker kind of looks like a biker so looks pretty neat

01:48:05.686 --> 01:48:05.986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:48:06.486 --> 01:48:08.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on to some Twitter topics.

01:48:08.747 --> 01:48:12.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

01:48:12.809 --> 01:48:13.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

01:48:14.590 --> 01:48:17.751
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys send us your tweets and we read them live here on the show.

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:26.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the first tweet tonight from Redertainment tweets us saying, I like putting corn on my tacks.

01:48:26.355 --> 01:48:27.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this weird?

01:48:28.274 --> 01:48:30.796
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S tweets us and says, Hey, what's your definition of shovelware?

01:48:58.072 --> 01:48:58.632
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.

01:48:58.652 --> 01:48:59.993
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your definition of shovelware?

01:49:00.353 --> 01:49:06.797
[SPEAKER_04]: My definition of shovelware is a game that is so blatant in copying another game you just can't even tell.

01:49:08.338 --> 01:49:14.922
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, very rushed game that is put out for the sole purpose of capitalizing on what's popular.

01:49:16.323 --> 01:49:18.464
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, Loki, anything you guys want to add to that?

01:49:19.625 --> 01:49:22.567
[SPEAKER_03]: A game with next to none production values.

01:49:22.907 --> 01:49:24.388
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just looks like crap.

01:49:24.448 --> 01:49:25.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's broken in it.

01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:27.550
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... Think of a ditch.

01:49:29.467 --> 01:49:30.448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely useless.

01:49:31.289 --> 01:49:33.030
[SPEAKER_03]: You shun your friends for buying it.

01:49:34.311 --> 01:49:36.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there nutritional value in dirt?

01:49:37.514 --> 01:49:37.714
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:49:38.675 --> 01:49:40.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither is there any entertainment value in shovel war.

01:49:44.059 --> 01:49:45.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see.

01:49:46.001 --> 01:49:46.742
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more tweets.

01:49:46.802 --> 01:49:47.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

01:49:47.322 --> 01:49:49.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Swim is tweeting us saying, Shit!

01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:51.471
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:51.691
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:49:52.052 --> 01:49:52.392
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

01:49:52.492 --> 01:49:54.956
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki talked about what I was going to call OLR about.

01:49:55.056 --> 01:49:56.378
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to rethink my call.

01:49:56.979 --> 01:50:00.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you could call in and just be a Loki fan and just be like, yeah, I agree with you, man.

01:50:01.365 --> 01:50:03.087
[SPEAKER_04]: On second thought, let's not inflate his ego anymore.

01:50:03.488 --> 01:50:03.768
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:05.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Other tweets.

01:50:05.991 --> 01:50:06.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is one.

01:50:06.893 --> 01:50:07.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:07.273
[SPEAKER_04]: D.C.

01:50:07.353 --> 01:50:07.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Universe

01:50:22.861 --> 01:50:24.743
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is being developed by Secret Identity.

01:50:25.824 --> 01:50:28.627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a team that was specifically assembled to make the MMO.

01:50:29.007 --> 01:50:31.609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a free-to-play MMO.

01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that.

01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:34.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Universe is going to be free.

01:50:34.532 --> 01:50:35.873
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, any interest in that?

01:50:35.913 --> 01:50:37.274
[SPEAKER_04]: A free-to-play Marvel MMO?

01:50:37.514 --> 01:50:38.315
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be all over that.

01:50:38.936 --> 01:50:39.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a freemium?

01:50:40.617 --> 01:50:41.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm assuming it has to be.

01:50:41.918 --> 01:50:43.099
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's free-to-play, it's freemium.

01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:43.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.180
[SPEAKER_04]: But

01:50:44.981 --> 01:50:58.226
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've actually remembered reading something about this, because I follow Agent M on Twitter, and apparently, I think he said it, or somebody with Marvel said it, that Bendis has a hand in the writing, so that's pretty cool.

01:50:58.726 --> 01:51:01.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctor Doom is going to be the antagonist, at least in the launch of the game.

01:51:01.967 --> 01:51:04.728
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that you will be able to play as famous Marvel heroes.

01:51:04.848 --> 01:51:09.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Nova, and Squirrel Girl.

01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:11.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Squirrel Girl is awesome!

01:51:11.210 --> 01:51:12.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

01:51:12.691 --> 01:51:18.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if everybody's the hero, so there must be like an instance thing or maybe kind of what they do in DC Universe where it's PvP.

01:51:18.812 --> 01:51:20.433
[SPEAKER_06]: I would want to play as Jessica Jones.

01:51:20.813 --> 01:51:21.573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious.

01:51:22.653 --> 01:51:24.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian Michael Bendis is doing some writing for the game.

01:51:25.174 --> 01:51:25.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

01:51:25.954 --> 01:51:28.435
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's story missions are taken from the comic themselves.

01:51:28.855 --> 01:51:29.356
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

01:51:50.314 --> 01:51:52.015
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is Squirrel Girl for the uninitiated?

01:51:52.035 --> 01:52:11.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Squirrel Girl, her mutant power is basically being an anthropomorphic squirrel and she can talk telepathically, oh, she can talk to squirrels and understand their language, but the thing is that she's actually defeated Doctor Doom and Thanos, the real thing, by the way, and all kinds of just bad guys and also kicked Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Avengers mansion and told him to shut his evil, evil pie hole.

01:52:13.024 --> 01:52:13.625
[SPEAKER_06]: She's super fun.

01:52:13.685 --> 01:52:15.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, right now, she's the babysitter.

01:52:15.667 --> 01:52:19.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess nanny slash babysitter for Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's baby.

01:52:19.410 --> 01:52:20.031
[SPEAKER_04]: The nanny.

01:52:23.014 --> 01:52:23.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Sheffield.

01:52:24.255 --> 01:52:30.000
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I like some of the cheeseball characters, and she's cheeseball, but actually cheeseball in a fun way.

01:52:30.521 --> 01:52:33.924
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have a character in Marvel Universe that's the nanny as a superhero.

01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:40.970
[SPEAKER_06]: There actually was a bad guy who was a nanny and orphan maker.

01:52:41.070 --> 01:52:42.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Or super nanny.

01:52:42.392 --> 01:52:44.215
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been very, very naughty.

01:52:44.315 --> 01:52:46.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you need to go to the naughty corner.

01:52:47.019 --> 01:52:48.422
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nanny and orphan maker.

01:52:49.488 --> 01:52:50.229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:51.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know my obscure.

01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:54.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Another tweet from Tiger Claw.

01:52:55.372 --> 01:53:01.417
[SPEAKER_04]: This show started off so well, and then there's this stuff going on in the real world, and now it's just, oh, who cares anymore.

01:53:01.717 --> 01:53:01.977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:53:03.298 --> 01:53:04.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Another tweet from Tiger Claw.

01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about L.A.

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.021
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

01:53:07.822 --> 01:53:09.483
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's a social club for this.

01:53:10.464 --> 01:53:10.824
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

01:53:10.904 --> 01:53:11.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this on Facebook or something?

01:53:11.945 --> 01:53:13.486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rockstar Social Club.

01:53:13.866 --> 01:53:15.287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a website thing that they have.

01:53:15.368 --> 01:53:16.889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tied in with all Rockstar games.

01:53:16.989 --> 01:53:17.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:53:17.489 --> 01:53:21.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you get through the whole thing, you get an exclusive outfit for the game.

01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:24.131
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's an incentive to get in on that thing.

01:53:24.371 --> 01:53:24.931
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into that.

01:53:25.452 --> 01:53:27.352
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into the Barbie doll stuff in your video games.

01:53:27.432 --> 01:53:28.553
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Social Club's pretty fun.

01:53:28.593 --> 01:53:30.853
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a bunch of stuff with Grand Theft Auto like they did.

01:53:31.714 --> 01:53:36.995
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the leaderboards for multiplayer, which I paid attention to a lot for a while.

01:53:37.875 --> 01:53:42.397
[SPEAKER_03]: They had things like the Grand Theft... It was the Liberty City Marathon where they tracked how long...

01:53:42.857 --> 01:53:47.481
[SPEAKER_03]: How far you ran, how far you drove, how many bullets you spent, that kind of stuff.

01:53:47.941 --> 01:53:49.202
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do a bunch of different things.

01:53:49.262 --> 01:53:51.844
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also they do stuff with Red Dead Redemption.

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:57.729
[SPEAKER_03]: They have little challenges that you do and you unlock skins and stuff like that through those challenges.

01:53:57.849 --> 01:53:58.830
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:05.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the costume you're going to unlock on the social club, if you're a member, the Chicago Lightning Suit.

01:54:05.728 --> 01:54:08.229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the protagonist, Cole Phillips, in the game.

01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:13.471
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're online, you get to access the Ask the Community feature in-game.

01:54:14.032 --> 01:54:20.234
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're interrogating a suspect, you don't know if they're telling the truth or not, you can see how other players responded in the same situation.

01:54:20.614 --> 01:54:22.735
[SPEAKER_04]: They're calling it a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

01:54:22.855 --> 01:54:23.976
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask the Audience Lifeline.

01:54:24.796 --> 01:54:25.757
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of crazy.

01:54:25.957 --> 01:54:28.058
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that kind of idea for games, though.

01:54:28.358 --> 01:54:41.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they had a thing come out about that game as well, where if you were having trouble in certain spots and whatnot, you could actually bypass some of the action sequences in the game.

01:54:42.027 --> 01:54:49.132
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you keep failing over and over and over again, you can just skip past it and get back to the narrative stuff, which is kind of unique.

01:54:51.816 --> 01:54:52.177
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:54:53.098 --> 01:54:56.121
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:54:56.141 --> 01:54:57.442
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it for Twitter topics tonight.

01:54:57.482 --> 01:55:00.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to talk to us throughout the week.

01:55:00.546 --> 01:55:01.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to some other news.

01:55:01.387 --> 01:55:01.667
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:55:02.127 --> 01:55:10.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamasutra ran kind of an editorial about the whole PlayStation debacle, I guess, right now.

01:55:10.536 --> 01:55:22.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they were saying the PlayStation brand faces an uncertain future, and they're worried that Sony's kind of, as we kind of put it before, not handling the situation correctly.

01:55:22.488 --> 01:55:24.950
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, here's a little test for you.

01:55:25.271 --> 01:55:30.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of the following statements are you most likely to agree with in one year's term?

01:55:31.096 --> 01:55:33.260
[SPEAKER_03]: A. Sony handled the situation amazingly.

01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:36.184
[SPEAKER_03]: They held up their hands and took an appropriate share of the blame.

01:55:36.464 --> 01:55:45.698
[SPEAKER_03]: They outlined a clear plan of action to remedy the situation and made sure that all stakeholders were recompensed beyond reasonable expectations.

01:55:46.358 --> 01:55:52.661
[SPEAKER_03]: and they showed their human side and came out of this as a stronger company.

01:55:52.982 --> 01:55:55.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Or B, it just kind of went away, didn't it?

01:55:55.763 --> 01:56:06.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony entirely laid the blame on hackers, launched a lot of legal flack, refused to take any responsibility, offered minimum clarity and token recompense.

01:56:06.989 --> 01:56:08.770
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one cares anymore.

01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:11.651
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they've encrypted my personal data now.

01:56:12.372 --> 01:56:14.113
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, most people probably agree with B.

01:56:15.033 --> 01:56:19.715
[SPEAKER_03]: And even like, you know, they're saying like, you know, their response has been pretty pitiful.

01:56:19.995 --> 01:56:25.058
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the best they did was send out an email and posted a post on their blog.

01:56:25.158 --> 01:56:33.542
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you even read it, they said, we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this outage has caused.

01:56:34.402 --> 01:56:37.003
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying this outage is like inclement water.

01:56:37.183 --> 01:56:39.683
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also said, we made a mistake here.

01:56:39.843 --> 01:56:40.704
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked a fight.

01:56:40.824 --> 01:56:41.644
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't win.

01:56:41.844 --> 01:56:44.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, they're saying they should have said, we made a mistake here.

01:56:44.404 --> 01:56:44.865
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked a fight.

01:56:44.885 --> 01:56:45.425
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't win.

01:56:45.805 --> 01:56:50.446
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with attack, highly likely, we neglected the protector stuff.

01:56:52.086 --> 01:56:55.087
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what they're saying is they could handle this, you know,

01:56:56.545 --> 01:57:03.110
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way that could kind of get people to trust them again, you know, just kind of showing their human side.

01:57:03.190 --> 01:57:11.036
[SPEAKER_03]: But without it, you know, and kind of like what we were going back to before with, you know, talking about Jack in the Box and, you know, that stuff they mentioned.

01:57:11.417 --> 01:57:21.805
[SPEAKER_03]: JetBlue, for example, had, you know, kind of a debacle and they ended up coming out of a better company because they spent time, effort to, you know,

01:57:23.931 --> 01:57:29.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Improved their customer service and in turn they became a strong company.

01:57:29.134 --> 01:57:31.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Domino's Pizza, Toyota.

01:57:31.816 --> 01:57:36.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some of the brands that were kind of hard by a situation like this.

01:57:36.699 --> 01:57:44.925
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they kind of turned it around with their dedication to kind of changing their ways.

01:57:45.385 --> 01:57:48.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony so far have said, here's some DLC.

01:57:48.387 --> 01:57:49.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we're going to...

01:57:50.548 --> 01:57:52.629
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on Protector Data now.

01:57:53.449 --> 01:57:54.389
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're kind of right.

01:57:54.549 --> 01:57:54.989
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:57:56.550 --> 01:58:03.212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the PlayStation brand, as far as trusting them with my information, maybe that's harmed a bit.

01:58:03.832 --> 01:58:09.934
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of stretching the PlayStation brand a little thin, if you ask me.

01:58:09.954 --> 01:58:12.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with tablet devices and stuff now.

01:58:12.835 --> 01:58:17.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it plays PlayStation 1 games, I don't really know if you should call it a PlayStation device.

01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:30.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you know, I hate to kind of beat a dead horse, because we were talking about this in Part A anyway, and it's kind of like, I really think Sony can recover from this, despite what all the rampant, angry gamer chat on the internet would make you think.

01:58:31.124 --> 01:58:36.546
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's like Microsoft recovered from the Red Ring of Death thing, and let's be real, that was a pretty serious thing that happened.

01:58:37.147 --> 01:58:40.568
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Nintendo recovered from, well, the Virtual Boy.

01:58:41.132 --> 01:58:46.275
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, companies can recover, and they will, but they have to do the right thing.

01:58:46.295 --> 01:58:46.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

01:58:47.396 --> 01:58:48.937
[SPEAKER_04]: Being hard-headed is not the right thing.

01:58:48.977 --> 01:58:56.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, Microsoft, I think they never really came up... Obviously, they didn't come up front and say how many of their systems were affected by the Red Ring problem.

01:58:57.762 --> 01:58:58.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a hint.

01:58:58.482 --> 01:59:00.263
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all of them at launch.

01:59:00.483 --> 01:59:01.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one.

01:59:02.044 --> 01:59:04.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one will die eventually.

01:59:05.046 --> 01:59:05.626
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this.

01:59:05.967 --> 01:59:06.807
[SPEAKER_03]: It will happen.

01:59:07.628 --> 01:59:08.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one.

01:59:08.828 --> 01:59:09.469
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be lucky.

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.949
[SPEAKER_03]: I would...

01:59:12.265 --> 01:59:12.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:59:12.765 --> 01:59:17.746
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be very impressed to see a system that actually... One of their launch systems that's still working today.

01:59:18.247 --> 01:59:19.507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's being regularly played.

01:59:19.747 --> 01:59:22.428
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee that there's less than 1%.

01:59:23.128 --> 01:59:24.288
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, let's be honest.

01:59:24.348 --> 01:59:27.729
[SPEAKER_03]: They've fixed it after multiple iterations and tweaks and stuff like that.

01:59:27.849 --> 01:59:29.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Now their system is stable.

01:59:29.670 --> 01:59:32.030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not dying.

01:59:33.090 --> 01:59:35.551
[SPEAKER_03]: They improved their warranties and stuff.

01:59:35.851 --> 01:59:36.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years and stuff.

01:59:36.771 --> 01:59:38.232
[SPEAKER_03]: And they covered replacements for a lot of it.

01:59:38.672 --> 01:59:38.872
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

01:59:39.292 --> 01:59:42.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sucked having to replace the system a bunch of times.

01:59:42.254 --> 01:59:43.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Apple and the iPhone 4.

01:59:43.695 --> 01:59:45.497
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another big one, too, with the antenna gate.

01:59:45.637 --> 01:59:46.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

01:59:46.297 --> 01:59:46.578
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

01:59:46.678 --> 01:59:47.959
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've recovered fine.

01:59:48.059 --> 01:59:49.760
[SPEAKER_04]: iPads 2s are selling like crazy.

01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:53.223
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all about how you handle it.

01:59:55.171 --> 02:00:00.535
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, I'm sorry, not everyone reads the PlayStation blog, okay?

02:00:00.775 --> 02:00:16.526
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking at your average mom and pop users, say they have, you know, signed up on the PlayStation Network and they buy stuff through there, they're not reading the internet blogs, you know, and stuff, and yeah, okay, they get an email, but let's just say, for example, that, you know, they used an email with that service that,

02:00:17.227 --> 02:00:18.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they don't use that quite regularly.

02:00:19.049 --> 02:00:32.224
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would have absolutely no idea this is going on until they hear from a media outlet saying, Oh yeah, Sony's just been hacked and all these people's credit card information has been leaked out.

02:00:33.585 --> 02:00:35.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that's not good.

02:00:35.867 --> 02:00:38.849
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you need to be telling your customers up front.

02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:42.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least, you know, being a little bit more clear about it.

02:00:42.391 --> 02:00:43.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Put out a statement or something.

02:00:43.912 --> 02:00:50.117
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they did the press conference thing, but I'm sorry, though.

02:00:50.417 --> 02:00:51.578
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just pointing blame.

02:00:52.398 --> 02:00:53.939
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:55.420
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting.

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:57.682
[SPEAKER_03]: E3, I'm sure they're going to mention something.

02:00:58.082 --> 02:01:00.844
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, it's still going to be fresh in everybody's mind.

02:01:02.836 --> 02:01:06.840
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, obviously it's not just Sony with news in the world right now.

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox, they had a pretty big thing come out this week.

02:01:09.062 --> 02:01:11.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Hulu Plus actually just came out to the system.

02:01:11.704 --> 02:01:15.928
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released on April 29th, and yeah, it was kind of fast.

02:01:15.948 --> 02:01:19.271
[SPEAKER_04]: The news came out during the week, and then suddenly, whew, bam, there's Hulu Plus.

02:01:19.712 --> 02:01:24.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there is actually this whole sponsorship going on, and I apologize.

02:01:24.156 --> 02:01:26.818
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot the company that was sponsoring it, but it doesn't matter.

02:01:26.838 --> 02:01:27.519
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not paying us.

02:01:27.899 --> 02:01:56.736
[SPEAKER_04]: so some company is actually sponsoring a two week preview of Hulu Plus right now and then I guess you can also get another one if you actually sign up through Hulu's website and you get a two week trial there as well so if you want to try out Hulu Plus for like a month you can do so I have not signed up for it and probably I'm not going to I think Hulu Plus is kind of a shitty idea because I'm not a fan of the fact that there's still commercials and you're paying for it like honestly I've got Netflix it's got the shows I want to see otherwise if they don't have it I'll just torn it

02:01:57.396 --> 02:02:06.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not to come out and admit that I'm a bloody thief or whatever, but I'd use Hulu if it was money or commercials, but not both.

02:02:06.932 --> 02:02:08.134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just ridiculous to me.

02:02:09.901 --> 02:02:10.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

02:02:31.596 --> 02:02:32.377
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

02:02:32.437 --> 02:02:33.037
[SPEAKER_03]: Diversity.

02:02:33.357 --> 02:02:35.139
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to... Oh, right.

02:02:35.159 --> 02:02:36.060
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do diversity.

02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:40.763
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch your cues through pretty much any device that will do streaming.

02:02:41.604 --> 02:02:43.706
[SPEAKER_03]: I use my PlayStation 3 for that.

02:02:43.826 --> 02:02:45.027
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually works pretty well for that.

02:02:45.727 --> 02:02:49.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulu doesn't look that great, though, because it's kind of low resolution.

02:02:49.570 --> 02:02:54.974
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've watched a few episodes of The Office that we were missing when we were catching up all the seasons and stuff.

02:02:55.054 --> 02:02:55.195
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

02:02:57.614 --> 02:02:58.014
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

02:03:19.451 --> 02:03:22.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, we do have something for the 3DS.

02:03:23.134 --> 02:03:29.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Excitebike 3D Classic is going to be offered on the 3DS for free.

02:03:29.578 --> 02:03:33.941
[SPEAKER_06]: When the 3DS eShop goes live, this is going to be a part of it.

02:03:34.962 --> 02:03:42.047
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, it's 3D Excitebike, so you get it in full lenticular motion.

02:03:42.067 --> 02:03:47.871
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't say where it was going to be for, but it could possibly just be Japan.

02:03:48.462 --> 02:03:50.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what's kind of retarded.

02:03:50.863 --> 02:03:53.605
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone's actually seen a Japanese 3DS.

02:03:54.185 --> 02:03:59.648
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have, but in the beginning of their... You know how we got this OK Go video?

02:03:59.688 --> 02:04:06.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they got this Mario live music performance thing over there as the free 3D video.

02:04:06.552 --> 02:04:10.954
[SPEAKER_03]: And before that actually starts, they have a 3D picture of Super Mario Bros.

02:04:11.235 --> 02:04:10.954
1.

02:04:12.175 --> 02:04:13.676
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way...

02:04:14.236 --> 02:04:15.137
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.681
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a neat effect to see.

02:04:38.041 --> 02:04:41.782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's cool, but I would not spend very much money.

02:04:41.983 --> 02:04:49.446
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the game is going to have to be a true NES classic that I need to have on my DS.

02:04:49.526 --> 02:04:50.886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way I'm going to buy it again.

02:04:50.906 --> 02:04:51.667
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, that's what they're doing.

02:04:51.687 --> 02:04:53.127
[SPEAKER_03]: I got burned on the way.

02:04:53.348 --> 02:04:54.228
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an emulator now.

02:04:54.588 --> 02:04:59.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously that works with, you know, these, I mean, come on, anything can run an NES emulator nowadays.

02:05:01.190 --> 02:05:06.791
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have an NES emulator that just spreads out the, you know, sprite layers.

02:05:06.811 --> 02:05:11.732
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, shit, when Homebrew comes out, I'm sure someone will come up with that.

02:05:11.812 --> 02:05:13.813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that complicated.

02:05:13.833 --> 02:05:14.613
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what they're going to do?

02:05:14.633 --> 02:05:23.435
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to charge you like four bucks for each one of those games because people will buy them even though it's really not worth the effort that they put in to develop this emulator.

02:05:24.895 --> 02:05:31.099
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really nice if they would just give us a kickback because we bought it on Wii Virtual Console.

02:05:31.319 --> 02:05:33.000
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know that's not going to happen.

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:34.101
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice?

02:05:34.381 --> 02:05:41.085
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice, but they don't really... I mean, they have accounts that are tied to the Wii, but it's not an account that you can take everywhere.

02:05:41.225 --> 02:05:43.666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically just an account that's tied to that console.

02:05:44.307 --> 02:05:47.128
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they had an actual centralized online...

02:05:48.089 --> 02:05:48.589
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

02:06:13.369 --> 02:06:18.413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all you'd have to do is just tweak the display so that each sprite layer is a different layer of 3D.

02:06:18.453 --> 02:06:20.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not hard.

02:06:21.516 --> 02:06:23.578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not difficult, and it's very minimal.

02:06:24.278 --> 02:06:26.600
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that should be free.

02:06:28.662 --> 02:06:29.182
[SPEAKER_04]: But it won't be.

02:06:29.622 --> 02:06:31.424
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after all, how else are these things going to print money?

02:06:32.102 --> 02:06:32.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Even just a discount.

02:06:33.063 --> 02:06:34.303
[SPEAKER_04]: Even just like a little discount.

02:06:35.364 --> 02:06:38.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe like if I get enough Nintendo achievements.

02:06:38.746 --> 02:06:39.267
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

02:06:39.947 --> 02:06:43.849
[SPEAKER_04]: I could like get one for free.

02:06:43.869 --> 02:06:45.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge them 99 cents.

02:06:45.491 --> 02:06:46.651
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they really should be charging.

02:06:46.671 --> 02:06:47.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, charge me 99 cents.

02:06:49.433 --> 02:06:49.853
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

02:06:49.913 --> 02:06:51.815
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I don't own the game at all, then fine.

02:06:51.855 --> 02:06:52.555
[SPEAKER_04]: Charge me $5.99.

02:06:53.516 --> 02:06:56.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Five what the game would have cost and the extra 99 cents for the 3D.

02:06:56.437 --> 02:06:57.278
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it should not even be.

02:06:57.838 --> 02:06:59.099
[SPEAKER_03]: $6 for an old NES game.

02:06:59.139 --> 02:06:59.559
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

02:06:59.599 --> 02:06:59.760
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:00.400
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:07:02.021 --> 02:07:03.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are worth it, but very few.

02:07:04.341 --> 02:07:05.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are worth it.

02:07:08.162 --> 02:07:13.583
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I mean, I can go buy the original on cartridge, but sometimes the original cartridges will cost you more than five bucks.

02:07:13.923 --> 02:07:15.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Just depends on what game you're talking about.

02:07:15.563 --> 02:07:16.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

02:07:16.444 --> 02:07:18.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if you're trying to fill up your Tengen collection.

02:07:18.784 --> 02:07:19.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:07:19.284 --> 02:07:20.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, Afterburner is mentioned.

02:07:21.484 --> 02:07:24.025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have your Fantasy Zone.

02:07:25.025 --> 02:07:25.745
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't know that.

02:07:26.045 --> 02:07:26.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

02:07:27.065 --> 02:07:27.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:07:27.585 --> 02:07:28.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, didn't I lend it to you?

02:07:28.666 --> 02:07:29.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

02:07:29.566 --> 02:07:30.526
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just so you know.

02:07:30.982 --> 02:07:39.550
[SPEAKER_06]: I was mentioning Afterburner, they did a Tengen one for Ness.

02:07:39.710 --> 02:07:40.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thought I'd mention that.

02:07:41.116 --> 02:07:42.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Comment in our chatroom from Toagak.

02:07:43.017 --> 02:07:45.877
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo ripped off a homebrew emulator.

02:07:46.778 --> 02:07:47.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

02:07:49.638 --> 02:07:52.879
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they need to because they've got an emulator for the Wii.

02:07:53.019 --> 02:07:54.320
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got all the tech docs they need.

02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:55.620
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got an emulator for a Wii.

02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:58.801
[SPEAKER_03]: They had cartridges on the Game Boy Advance.

02:07:59.221 --> 02:08:00.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even, I think, the Game Boy Color.

02:08:01.022 --> 02:08:03.462
[SPEAKER_03]: They had NES cartridges.

02:08:05.943 --> 02:08:09.205
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've gotten... I mean, hell, they have an emulator that runs on the Game Boy.

02:08:09.325 --> 02:08:11.506
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously going to run on the 3DS.

02:08:12.007 --> 02:08:13.928
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have that kind of data there.

02:08:14.088 --> 02:08:16.890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just minimal tweaking to get it to be in 3D.

02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:21.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's not any special effects that they're adding or anything.

02:08:21.993 --> 02:08:29.077
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it was like some Mode 7 games or something like that, that might be a little bit cooler if those were in 3D because they had a lot of scaling there, but...

02:08:29.937 --> 02:08:37.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, just, just doing like, you know, separating the sprite layers is, I'm sorry, it's like child's play stuff.

02:08:38.242 --> 02:08:43.524
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, I mean, people are gonna find it neat, but once again, they're selling you on the gimmick.

02:08:43.905 --> 02:08:49.428
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling you on your memories of these retro games because they're like, oh my god, Nintendo gets, oh, it's in 3D now!

02:08:51.789 --> 02:08:59.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you're going to buy into that and you're just only encouraging them to spend what little effort they will on this stuff.

02:09:00.655 --> 02:09:01.375
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, you know what?

02:09:01.415 --> 02:09:02.776
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's what you want, then fine.

02:09:03.497 --> 02:09:05.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're not going to change their ways anytime soon.

02:09:06.819 --> 02:09:07.619
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:08.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy what you want.

02:09:10.601 --> 02:09:11.202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my money.

02:09:11.242 --> 02:09:12.202
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll spend it how I want.

02:09:12.502 --> 02:09:13.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:09:14.984 --> 02:09:17.405
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did you pay to import the Japanese 3DS again?

02:09:17.966 --> 02:09:18.326
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

02:09:18.986 --> 02:09:19.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you remind me?

02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:25.285
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's role is to be the girl, your role is to be the tech master, and mine is to give the both of you shit.

02:09:25.546 --> 02:09:25.966
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not just a girl.

02:09:38.953 --> 02:09:42.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to say a bitch, but I thought that would be me.

02:09:42.896 --> 02:09:52.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I would almost consider selling that 3DS again just to get rid of it because I'm not playing anything on it really right now and I have a feeling it's just going to be collecting dust like my DS is.

02:09:55.336 --> 02:09:56.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:10:13.419 --> 02:10:15.100
[SPEAKER_03]: I will seriously think about it.

02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:22.082
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't have some really awesome games at launch, then count me out.

02:10:22.202 --> 02:10:27.444
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait until some future versions come out.

02:10:28.044 --> 02:10:32.386
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be so impulse crazy nowadays because it really doesn't get me anything.

02:10:32.546 --> 02:10:35.827
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play Ridge Racer in 3D for a little bit.

02:10:36.047 --> 02:10:39.208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool, but I don't know.

02:10:39.448 --> 02:10:41.749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that big of a deal.

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:48.457
[SPEAKER_03]: And it all really matters about the cost of that console, because, man, that thing's like $300 plus $100 for the controller.

02:10:49.837 --> 02:10:50.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

02:10:52.538 --> 02:10:52.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe.

02:10:54.719 --> 02:10:57.741
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on with some, what, hacking news, right?

02:10:57.981 --> 02:11:01.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the PlayStation Network's not the only thing that's being hacked.

02:11:01.862 --> 02:11:09.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, there's kind of been a struggle between, you know, hackers creating custom firmwares for the drives of...

02:11:10.406 --> 02:11:38.602
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course Microsoft in updating those they have the new firmware that's going to be coming out or the new dashboard update that's going to tweak the disks as well as enabling what they call AP 2.5 on all the games it's basically a new copy protection that they have right now on a couple of the Call of Duty games and on Assassin's Creed and actually some of the newer games of course all that stuff can be patched

02:11:39.903 --> 02:11:41.886
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some interesting things coming out.

02:11:42.226 --> 02:11:45.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this is almost similar to the PlayStation 3.

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:52.259
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there is a device coming out called the X360 Key.

02:11:52.399 --> 02:11:56.765
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow you to play any game from a USB drive.

02:11:57.646 --> 02:12:07.797
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it's basically going to be, it's going to be a device that connects in between your Xbox 360, the SATA connection that's on there, and the DVD drive.

02:12:08.257 --> 02:12:12.962
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will allow it to emulate the actual DVD drive itself.

02:12:13.042 --> 02:12:18.828
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll make it think that it's playing discs off the drive when it's actually playing ISOs off a USB drive.

02:12:19.549 --> 02:12:20.450
[SPEAKER_03]: or a hard drive.

02:12:20.650 --> 02:12:22.853
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually the system has Linux running on it.

02:12:22.913 --> 02:12:24.054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fully upgradable.

02:12:25.976 --> 02:12:34.305
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it's going to have protection against whatever the E25 protection emulation as well built in there.

02:12:35.045 --> 02:12:35.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Outro Outro

02:12:52.777 --> 02:13:04.790
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, if that's not your way to go, the Commodore Forever, they announced that they're going to have a new iXtreme LT firmware for all drives, including...

02:13:08.394 --> 02:13:08.975
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not.

02:13:09.475 --> 02:13:11.057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the hacking group, Commodore Forever.

02:13:11.277 --> 02:13:11.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Last Ninja?

02:13:12.158 --> 02:13:15.521
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been working on firmwares for the drives for a long time.

02:13:16.022 --> 02:13:23.650
[SPEAKER_03]: They say their LT 2.0 supports the XG D3, which is the new disk format that Microsoft's putting out to gain that extra one gig.

02:13:24.250 --> 02:13:30.337
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the slim, light-on 0.225 drive, which was unhackable as of right now.

02:13:32.258 --> 02:13:41.263
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently that will allow you to bypass all this different protection and allow you to flash your drives and it's supposed to be untraceable as of right now.

02:13:41.303 --> 02:13:48.688
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the light touch stuff has been pretty stealthy as far as live goes so that's kind of interesting.

02:13:49.148 --> 02:14:12.829
[SPEAKER_03]: and the last thing was another device called Xbox 360 Optical Drive Emulation and it's an emulator that will be a little bit similar to the X360 key whereas the device set will make it look like it's running actual disks when it's running stuff off of a hard drive.

02:14:13.710 --> 02:14:16.032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.

02:14:16.072 --> 02:14:29.443
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this stuff can be patched out with one firmware update, but some of this, especially with the custom firmwares for the disk drives, it's back and forth with them.

02:14:29.583 --> 02:14:42.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the new firmware that's coming out, if you do have a flash device right now, what it's going to do is it's going to flash it back to stock, and then it's going to copy protect it, I guess, so that you can't adjust the firmware that's on your drive.

02:14:42.113 --> 02:14:43.074
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's kind of interesting.

02:14:46.991 --> 02:14:50.752
[SPEAKER_04]: How long before we're emulating the actual Xbox 360 on our PCs?

02:14:51.273 --> 02:14:52.353
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time.

02:14:53.073 --> 02:14:56.594
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking multi-core processors and emulating that stuff.

02:14:57.415 --> 02:14:59.635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a long time before we're able to do that.

02:15:00.676 --> 02:15:01.256
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years.

02:15:04.044 --> 02:15:08.288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

02:15:08.368 --> 02:15:10.150
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one has to do with the iPhone.

02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:18.937
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, this is something I actually did a double take and I was like, what is this being posted in our show role thread for?

02:15:18.997 --> 02:15:20.898
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't we reported on this before?

02:15:21.399 --> 02:15:23.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have, but we haven't.

02:15:23.421 --> 02:15:29.766
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean is, this is yet another game that has appeared on the iTunes App Store that was copied off of a Flash game.

02:15:30.246 --> 02:15:56.725
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is called Achilles Defense It was available on the iTunes Store They're based in Hanoi, Vietnam PTT Solution It is a rip-off of Ironhide's Clash of the Olympians Ironhide Game Studio, excuse me, Clash of the Olympians The only difference is Ironhide's game has three characters PTT's app has one The music, the artwork, the gameplay It is all the same

02:15:57.365 --> 02:15:58.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Clash of the Olympians

02:16:14.302 --> 02:16:20.285
[SPEAKER_04]: Needless to say, it's there, it's been on the App Store How does Apple prevent this?

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:32.131
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because they don't really screen the content of games I don't know, like, obviously this news is very sad That development company who, you know, had the game out there for free Did you see the Mario ripoff on there too?

02:16:32.231 --> 02:16:40.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, that was the other, I think, thing that had come out before There's Mario ripoff and there was that other game too that had come out So...

02:16:41.676 --> 02:16:44.617
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blocks Cometh, and then there was also some bunny game.

02:16:45.278 --> 02:16:46.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunny fighting game.

02:16:46.178 --> 02:16:49.059
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was less of a rip-off and more of a rights issue.

02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:50.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Who owned the rights to it and stuff.

02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:52.741
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other one was a complete rip-off.

02:16:53.325 --> 02:17:04.029
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, Ironhide is pissed and they wrote Apple to complain and they want gamers to help assist them by lodging their own complaints in the game's comment space.

02:17:04.069 --> 02:17:06.150
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're encouraging people to downvote this thing.

02:17:06.531 --> 02:17:12.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it is the weekend, so I don't know what's going to happen, but come Monday I'm sure it's going to get crazy.

02:17:14.054 --> 02:17:15.714
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe Apple will pull it down, I don't know.

02:17:19.825 --> 02:17:20.326
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:17:21.767 --> 02:17:24.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to the mailbag.

02:17:24.929 --> 02:17:26.950
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and boy, we've got a fun one this week.

02:17:27.471 --> 02:17:30.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Because DarkSakura got a taco before the show started.

02:17:31.013 --> 02:17:33.295
[SPEAKER_04]: She was only getting that taco if we got 10 emails.

02:17:33.495 --> 02:17:34.236
[SPEAKER_06]: We got more than that.

02:17:34.276 --> 02:17:34.996
[SPEAKER_04]: We got more than that.

02:17:35.056 --> 02:17:36.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know if she's reading every single one.

02:17:37.638 --> 02:17:38.658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doubting that, right?

02:17:38.678 --> 02:17:39.098
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

02:17:39.138 --> 02:17:48.220
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, pretty much anything that's repeating the emails that Sony sent out for PSN and our rehashes of things we've already discussed, not reading them.

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:50.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give you a super tip if you want to email the show.

02:17:51.021 --> 02:17:53.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, the show is about where every gamer has a voice.

02:17:53.821 --> 02:17:59.842
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes people want to email us to clue us into news and things that are going on, which is fine, especially because sometimes we miss those things.

02:17:59.862 --> 02:18:02.143
[SPEAKER_04]: They fall off the radar, like the case of the Marvel Universe thing.

02:18:02.904 --> 02:18:03.565
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier in the show.

02:18:03.686 --> 02:18:05.610
[SPEAKER_04]: And TigerClaw brought that to our attention via Twitter.

02:18:05.911 --> 02:18:08.617
[SPEAKER_04]: But if everybody's talking about it, like the PSN thing,

02:18:09.229 --> 02:18:10.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably going to cover it in the show.

02:18:11.531 --> 02:18:13.652
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to know your thoughts.

02:18:14.113 --> 02:18:15.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just regurgitate the news.

02:18:15.654 --> 02:18:17.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us what you think.

02:18:17.395 --> 02:18:23.860
[SPEAKER_04]: A better email will tell us about what you plan to do because of the Sony hack, which I imagine we're going to get to in some of these emails.

02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:28.424
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them were that they were also repeat emailers I'm trying to give new people attention to.

02:18:28.684 --> 02:18:29.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, absolutely.

02:18:29.665 --> 02:18:30.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

02:18:30.205 --> 02:18:36.570
[SPEAKER_04]: As it is, I'm being... If you've had a lot of emails, if your voice has been heard a lot, don't be butthurt that we do some other people tonight.

02:18:36.590 --> 02:18:36.570
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

02:18:39.252 --> 02:18:40.193
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading 11 of them.

02:18:40.474 --> 02:18:40.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

02:18:40.934 --> 02:18:41.194
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:18:41.234 --> 02:18:41.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here we go, then.

02:18:42.196 --> 02:18:42.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:18:43.797 --> 02:18:45.579
[SPEAKER_06]: This one, it's taco time.

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:50.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Join our valiant chef, DarkSakura, on her quest to defeat the evil Montezuma and his army of veggies.

02:18:51.326 --> 02:18:54.810
[SPEAKER_06]: Will our hero be able to stop a digestive disaster and create the perfect taco?

02:18:55.171 --> 02:18:56.152
[SPEAKER_06]: With your help, she can.

02:18:56.292 --> 02:18:57.433
[SPEAKER_06]: Only for Xbox 360.

02:18:57.493 --> 02:19:00.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-order today and receive an official taco time salsa spoon.

02:19:00.877 --> 02:19:02.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I know this has been terribly lame, but I couldn't resist.

02:19:03.059 --> 02:19:05.800
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you at least get a chuckle out of this.

02:19:06.021 --> 02:19:08.322
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a long-time listener, but this isn't my first time writing in.

02:19:08.702 --> 02:19:12.605
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys help me survive my boring job, so keep up the gaming news and crazy tangents.

02:19:12.985 --> 02:19:14.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Feed Jamie tacos now!

02:19:14.406 --> 02:19:15.487
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from Panaxium.

02:19:15.627 --> 02:19:16.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, we fed her.

02:19:16.808 --> 02:19:17.928
[SPEAKER_06]: And he sent me a picture.

02:19:17.948 --> 02:19:18.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet.

02:19:19.602 --> 02:19:20.263
[SPEAKER_04]: TacoTime.

02:19:20.683 --> 02:19:21.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is great.

02:19:21.384 --> 02:19:22.164
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

02:19:23.045 --> 02:19:27.069
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually put your picture in the little chef's hat on TacoTime.

02:19:27.609 --> 02:19:29.671
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually pretty decent Photoshopping.

02:19:29.691 --> 02:19:30.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saving it.

02:19:30.152 --> 02:19:32.434
[SPEAKER_04]: Upload that to the Orange Lawns Radio website thingy.

02:19:33.174 --> 02:19:36.417
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the super secret email now, so we stopped getting the Godse pictures.

02:19:36.477 --> 02:19:38.059
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you do that, Rob.

02:19:38.359 --> 02:19:38.840
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine.

02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:39.260
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look it up.

02:19:40.934 --> 02:19:41.555
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take care of it.

02:19:41.575 --> 02:19:43.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Forward it to me so I do it.

02:19:45.338 --> 02:19:45.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:19:46.118 --> 02:19:46.779
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take care of it later.

02:19:46.799 --> 02:19:47.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

02:19:47.239 --> 02:19:47.840
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded it.

02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:48.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.221
[SPEAKER_06]: This one.

02:19:49.641 --> 02:19:51.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR, it's been a while since I last emailed you guys.

02:19:52.023 --> 02:19:53.104
[SPEAKER_06]: I also miss listening live.

02:19:53.144 --> 02:19:54.925
[SPEAKER_06]: I really need to get back into the habit of doing that.

02:19:55.045 --> 02:19:55.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you do.

02:19:57.583 --> 02:20:06.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I just got through with changing pretty much all of my passwords on multiple sites, as well as notifying my bank of the PSN intrusion, compromising my account.

02:20:06.787 --> 02:20:08.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, this has been a huge wake-up call for me.

02:20:09.088 --> 02:20:12.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Never before have I been this concerned about my personal information on the internet.

02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:20.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's failure to protect my privacy and resolve this issue as quickly as possible really has me thinking twice about my future purchases on the PSN.

02:20:21.673 --> 02:20:26.177
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard of PSN cards like you buy in the stores, sort of like the Xbox Live or iTunes cards.

02:20:26.577 --> 02:20:28.038
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a safer route to go.

02:20:29.359 --> 02:20:33.243
[SPEAKER_06]: On a lighter note, have any of you checked out Sonic Colors for the Wii?

02:20:33.643 --> 02:20:37.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Before Sonic Generations comes out, I highly recommend that you don't miss out on this game.

02:20:37.946 --> 02:20:40.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's the one I was wanting to get, but we loaned out our Wii.

02:20:41.549 --> 02:20:42.390
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a lot of fun.

02:20:42.450 --> 02:20:43.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Great soundtrack as well.

02:20:43.491 --> 02:20:47.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega focused a lot more on the game design and gameplay rather than story this time around.

02:20:47.995 --> 02:20:48.855
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have no issue...

02:20:49.776 --> 02:20:54.000
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other than rolling my eyes at some of the cheesy lines in the cutscenes.

02:20:54.321 --> 02:20:55.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's all for now.

02:20:55.121 --> 02:20:56.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for reading, Osfer.

02:20:56.302 --> 02:20:56.723
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

02:20:56.823 --> 02:21:00.046
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that Xbox 360 OLR autographed faceplate?

02:21:00.106 --> 02:21:00.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck.

02:21:00.947 --> 02:21:04.130
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just actually found a bunch of faceplates.

02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:05.852
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay.

02:21:06.673 --> 02:21:12.138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to email you back with my real email so that you can email me and we'll work on it, okay?

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:15.780
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello there, Orange Lens Radio.

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:24.383
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel compelled to take the time out of my busy night to write you this email as the three of you on occasion entertain the masses.

02:21:25.023 --> 02:21:35.086
[SPEAKER_06]: I found your show while being very bored at work on Stitcher today because at 1330 hours I was actually going through the mini podcast and I found yours to be the most enjoyable.

02:21:35.466 --> 02:21:37.987
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I never really listened to any type of podcast.

02:21:38.627 --> 02:21:43.611
[SPEAKER_06]: I was bored of my music mixes on my Blackberry and wanted to hear people talk about topics I enjoy.

02:21:44.051 --> 02:21:50.395
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, after listening I was heavily informed about what's what in gaming and not to mention walked away with a craving of tacos.

02:21:51.036 --> 02:22:02.684
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be subscribing via iTunes but sadly not too many of my friends are gamers so I don't really have anyone to tell as I work executive protection and the three friends I would rather talk about weapon calibers.

02:22:03.405 --> 02:22:03.565
Okay.

02:22:04.065 --> 02:22:07.748
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will be trying to tune in while you are live on Sundays from now on.

02:22:08.148 --> 02:22:09.509
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks for the great podcast.

02:22:09.569 --> 02:22:12.392
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it and I found something new to look forward to at the end of the week.

02:22:12.472 --> 02:22:13.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

02:22:13.112 --> 02:22:13.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Shattered Hawk.

02:22:13.813 --> 02:22:14.113
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

02:22:14.453 --> 02:22:16.735
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, if you like tacos, you should try Navajo Tacos.

02:22:16.755 --> 02:22:21.118
[SPEAKER_06]: Your head will explode from the pure deliciousness of this dish.

02:22:22.059 --> 02:22:23.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I can find them.

02:22:24.161 --> 02:22:24.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

02:22:24.661 --> 02:22:25.001
[SPEAKER_06]: I love tacos.

02:22:25.021 --> 02:22:27.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a chain or is that a type of taco?

02:22:27.343 --> 02:22:27.784
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:22:29.105 --> 02:22:32.668
[SPEAKER_04]: We need either a recipe or we need a FedEx box to show up at the house.

02:22:32.728 --> 02:22:33.829
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a 411.

02:22:34.749 --> 02:22:36.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, you see what I did there?

02:22:36.611 --> 02:22:37.112
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm clever.

02:22:37.472 --> 02:22:37.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

02:22:38.613 --> 02:22:38.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:22:41.135 --> 02:22:45.279
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering regarding the PSN hack slash outage hack slash

02:22:46.039 --> 02:22:53.528
[SPEAKER_06]: If the possible phishing email I wrote about at the end of May had anything relation to the intrusion.

02:22:53.989 --> 02:23:02.339
[SPEAKER_06]: The email did seem, upon reflection, fairly legitimate with no questions or warnings that you had to click through the link which I left untouched to enter personal information.

02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.203
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the address it was sent from seemed suspect.

02:23:05.723 --> 02:23:17.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, I noticed the latest issue of Games Magazine, July 2011, has a feature story on the selling of harmonics and the suspension of Guitar Hero, as well as the reviewers' take on the Dead Space 2 ad controversy.

02:23:18.206 --> 02:23:23.387
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, of course, months-old news, but to be fair, Games is not intended as a video game news source.

02:23:23.487 --> 02:23:34.990
[SPEAKER_06]: It is first and foremost a magazine of crossword and logic puzzles, with articles about board games, and within the last decade or so of video games as well, with issues likely being put together months before being published.

02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:37.591
[SPEAKER_06]: The July issue arriving in late April.

02:23:38.092 --> 02:23:43.315
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy games for what it is, but wonder about your take on the ultra-casual gaming press.

02:23:43.395 --> 02:23:51.019
[SPEAKER_06]: And this comes from Robert M. I don't really pay attention to it, so I don't know.

02:23:51.299 --> 02:23:54.941
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally stopped getting a lot of those news release emails.

02:23:55.001 --> 02:23:56.102
[SPEAKER_06]: Zynga farted.

02:23:57.162 --> 02:23:57.943
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that type of thing.

02:23:59.039 --> 02:23:59.700
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of don't care.

02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:02.843
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if I want to play...

02:24:22.022 --> 02:24:28.568
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a local channel here that reported on the whole PlayStation Network breach because it was the top story on the day that it happened.

02:24:28.608 --> 02:24:30.329
[SPEAKER_04]: It let off the 11 o'clock news.

02:24:30.810 --> 02:24:36.194
[SPEAKER_04]: And they twisted it to turn into a parents need to be monitoring what their children do type of story.

02:24:36.514 --> 02:24:39.396
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yes, I understand they should, but it seemed like...

02:24:40.237 --> 02:24:40.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

02:24:40.357 --> 02:24:40.417
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:05.998
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, completely random aside, but it totally ties into this email.

02:25:06.579 --> 02:25:11.749
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get a last-minute story submission, and it has to do with speaking of...

02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:14.971
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:43.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I guess they're going to merge and continue to publish worthless stories.

02:25:45.782 --> 02:25:46.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:25:47.665 --> 02:25:49.830
[SPEAKER_06]: So, is it my turn?

02:25:50.291 --> 02:25:50.771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sorry.

02:25:50.792 --> 02:25:50.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:25:51.857 --> 02:26:00.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello all, okay, I know this is probably your first email, first or second email, but I'm going to tell you, if you are going to pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:03.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Apostrophes are for possessives, the end.

02:26:03.621 --> 02:26:04.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I'll read it.

02:26:05.302 --> 02:26:07.662
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello all, first of all, I have to say I'm loving the show.

02:26:07.742 --> 02:26:12.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, I want to get Jamie her tacos, so I thought I should write to you guys.

02:26:13.304 --> 02:26:14.665
[SPEAKER_06]: My taco was delicious, thank you.

02:26:15.285 --> 02:26:16.065
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question.

02:26:16.426 --> 02:26:17.906
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a hardcore MMO player.

02:26:17.966 --> 02:26:24.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard has its firm grasp on my wallet for six years, and I recently dabbled a bit in playing Rift alongside WoW.

02:26:24.750 --> 02:26:28.932
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, I think Rift made me want to play WoW again, and I always wondered why that was.

02:26:29.072 --> 02:26:29.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Any ideas?

02:26:30.173 --> 02:26:32.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe because it made you really appreciate World of Warcraft?

02:26:33.415 --> 02:26:33.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe?

02:26:34.695 --> 02:26:37.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there are lots of new MMOs being released.

02:26:37.057 --> 02:26:42.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Terra Online, which I like to call Chicks with Gigantic Boobs MMO, The Old Republic, and The Secret World.

02:26:42.962 --> 02:26:43.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I want to play them?

02:26:43.763 --> 02:26:47.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I actually want to play all of them, but I know most will probably disappoint me.

02:26:48.047 --> 02:26:51.530
[SPEAKER_06]: In reality, I'll probably just stick with the two MMOs, but yes, here's my real question.

02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:54.452
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, do you think it's possible to juggle two MMOs at the same time?

02:26:54.892 --> 02:26:58.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good show, and I hope that you get your tacos, Jamie.

02:26:58.576 --> 02:26:59.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Love, Syl.

02:26:59.797 --> 02:27:01.438
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it was our guest from Horde House this week.

02:27:01.858 --> 02:27:02.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:27:03.659 --> 02:27:04.019
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

02:27:04.479 --> 02:27:06.180
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad now correcting.

02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:08.840
[SPEAKER_04]: You bitch.

02:27:08.961 --> 02:27:09.581
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:27:09.621 --> 02:27:10.941
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I said that was your role on the show.

02:27:11.041 --> 02:27:13.182
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do that to everybody, so much love.

02:27:13.442 --> 02:27:13.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:27:13.762 --> 02:27:21.824
[SPEAKER_06]: So, first of all, I actually want to go back and play Star Trek Online while I'm playing WoW, but I can't afford the two together right now.

02:27:22.024 --> 02:27:28.465
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the hardest thing, is that, you know, trying to pay for two is usually the hardest thing to play to.

02:27:29.105 --> 02:27:31.606
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of people juggle a freemium and a premium.

02:27:32.186 --> 02:27:32.727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

02:27:46.096 --> 02:27:49.360
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was on Star Trek Online, I played Ragnarok Online on a free server.

02:27:50.222 --> 02:27:53.566
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was keeping up with two MMOs, no problem.

02:27:54.147 --> 02:27:56.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the time it was just, which one are my friends hanging out on?

02:27:56.330 --> 02:27:57.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll go play this one right now.

02:27:57.311 --> 02:28:00.516
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, my guild's all asleep because I'm in America and they're not.

02:28:01.277 --> 02:28:01.477
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

02:28:02.378 --> 02:28:02.818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

02:28:31.332 --> 02:28:33.614
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:28:51.011 --> 02:28:51.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice email.

02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:10.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey y'all, I was listening to OLR about the PSN network going down and the guy who was writing in thought that Anonymous did it.

02:29:10.644 --> 02:29:16.568
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally don't think it was them because they said they had realized it wouldn't hurt the people they were trying to stand up for, which is a point that I made.

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:24.973
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds to me like someone heard that Anonymous was doing this and decided to take advantage of having an obvious patsy and cover their own tracks.

02:29:25.393 --> 02:29:30.536
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys seem to focus mainly on taking down websites and I've never heard of Anonymous actually stealing stuff.

02:29:31.156 --> 02:29:34.739
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess it's possible, but it just doesn't sound right.

02:29:35.159 --> 02:29:38.961
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the same people who defended that Casey Hines kid who was bullied.

02:29:39.862 --> 02:29:43.465
[SPEAKER_06]: They sound like well-meaning folk, it just doesn't seem like them to me.

02:29:43.625 --> 02:29:48.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Also about the hacking emails, I got one from Best Buy 2 saying that their email list had been stolen.

02:29:48.588 --> 02:29:55.213
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems to be going around right now, and that's from Holly D. Wow, that's another Horde House listener I recognize.

02:29:55.233 --> 02:29:55.653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:29:57.111 --> 02:29:58.272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

02:29:58.992 --> 02:30:04.416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting to see, especially with so many people involved, what the effect on the hackers could be.

02:30:04.436 --> 02:30:08.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the end of the day, the hackers are the ones to blame, right?

02:30:09.559 --> 02:30:13.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Although Sony should share their part in the accountability.

02:30:14.202 --> 02:30:16.284
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:30:16.704 --> 02:30:23.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony needs to show what they're really doing to stop the hackers, other than, well, our system's hack-proof, inviting them in the front door.

02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:24.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk out of your ass.

02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:25.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:30:28.917 --> 02:30:30.783
[SPEAKER_06]: If any, please answer in comments or email.

02:30:31.185 --> 02:30:32.509
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is this?

02:30:34.694 --> 02:30:36.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, this is crap email.

02:30:36.235 --> 02:30:36.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

02:30:36.495 --> 02:30:37.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it spam?

02:30:37.216 --> 02:30:38.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:30:38.797 --> 02:30:43.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, we have one from Anime Jam Session Podcast Crew, which would be our buddy Ranma.

02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:44.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Skip it.

02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:45.581
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

02:30:45.621 --> 02:30:46.041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

02:30:47.022 --> 02:30:47.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Greetings, one and all.

02:30:47.842 --> 02:30:49.803
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session here.

02:30:50.084 --> 02:30:54.907
[SPEAKER_06]: In between downtime and edits for the site and podcasting and everything else, I have found time to send an email.

02:30:55.447 --> 02:30:58.149
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have something to discuss, and I will get straight to the point.

02:30:58.669 --> 02:31:03.452
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you squeed with delight over the revival of the Commodore 64, and Loki thought it was crazy.

02:31:03.972 --> 02:31:04.972
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have your back on this.

02:31:05.132 --> 02:31:12.294
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't grow up with a C64, but instead a Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 MC-10 and Color Computer 3 for me.

02:31:12.654 --> 02:31:13.654
[SPEAKER_06]: I had one of those too.

02:31:14.854 --> 02:31:18.455
[SPEAKER_06]: From reading the specs and design build of it, I can justify the cost, especially the Ultimate.

02:31:19.035 --> 02:31:29.277
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you right now that the parts alone would run about $300 to $350 and probably another $200 for the case itself, since it's going to be made from the original materials, not the soft, cheap plastic crap, so Loki, stop hatin'.

02:31:30.177 --> 02:31:30.597
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

02:31:30.637 --> 02:31:31.878
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for me to get back to work here.

02:31:31.938 --> 02:31:34.159
[SPEAKER_06]: The monkeys are flinging their poo at me, duck.

02:31:34.639 --> 02:31:35.839
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care and stay black.

02:31:35.959 --> 02:31:37.320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now the joke is officially dead.

02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:44.462
[SPEAKER_06]: This email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, a podcast dedicated to anime, cons, conventions, pop culture, and everything in between.

02:31:44.502 --> 02:31:46.723
[SPEAKER_06]: Guaranteed podcast derailing or your money back.

02:31:47.043 --> 02:31:50.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out at www.animejamsession.com Also on iTunes.

02:31:51.045 --> 02:31:52.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.

02:31:52.425 --> 02:31:55.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you read that part again that says to Loki, stop hating?

02:31:55.667 --> 02:31:56.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop hatin'!

02:31:57.647 --> 02:31:59.268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why he's on the show is to hate.

02:32:00.746 --> 02:32:01.828
[SPEAKER_04]: He's our resident hater.

02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:04.192
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's playing Portal right now.

02:32:04.953 --> 02:32:06.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, Portal sucks.

02:32:07.037 --> 02:32:07.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, no, it doesn't.

02:32:07.939 --> 02:32:08.640
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nothing.

02:32:09.761 --> 02:32:12.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR crew, long-time podcast listener, first-time writer.

02:32:13.103 --> 02:32:17.827
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been many times that I have almost written in to comment on this, but never really felt compelled to until now.

02:32:18.247 --> 02:32:19.628
[SPEAKER_06]: My reason for writing is twofold.

02:32:20.088 --> 02:32:21.949
[SPEAKER_06]: One, most importantly, free tacos for DarkSakura.

02:32:22.149 --> 02:32:22.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you.

02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:25.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this email will get to that magic number 10.

02:32:26.072 --> 02:32:27.673
[SPEAKER_06]: You're up there on the list.

02:32:28.234 --> 02:32:29.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, Rob, please say aloud the following.

02:32:29.935 --> 02:32:30.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, ready?

02:32:31.256 --> 02:32:32.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery.

02:32:33.766 --> 02:32:36.528
[SPEAKER_04]: Beardy McWhiskey will win the lottery and give half to Rob.

02:32:37.249 --> 02:32:42.774
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm requesting this because obviously Rob is a prophet given his prediction of the PSN outage being a bigger deal than initially reported.

02:32:43.815 --> 02:32:51.701
[SPEAKER_06]: I was listening to the podcast last week on the same day Sony said, Oh, and by the way, you know all that sensitive data we made you give us to play our games and use our services?

02:32:52.242 --> 02:32:57.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we just put a Furby on guard to watch security and I guess the battery just ran out.

02:32:58.127 --> 02:33:07.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally, if anything was up, that little sumbitch would start talking all kinds of crazy stuff like, Meeloo, wow!

02:33:10.869 --> 02:33:12.050
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't worry, everyone.

02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:13.331
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put in a new battery.

02:33:13.391 --> 02:33:18.534
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, just watch all your credit card info and change all your passwords.

02:33:18.554 --> 02:33:19.154
[SPEAKER_06]: We cool, dog?

02:33:19.174 --> 02:33:19.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we cool.

02:33:21.335 --> 02:33:24.177
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure this topic has been beaten into the ground, so you can leave it at that.

02:33:24.437 --> 02:33:27.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Beards of Whiskey and Rock and Roll, Beardy McWhiskey.

02:33:27.639 --> 02:33:28.739
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Beardy McWhiskey.

02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:30.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he Canadian?

02:33:30.721 --> 02:33:32.422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but I want him to send me some whiskey.

02:33:32.482 --> 02:33:33.462
[SPEAKER_06]: And send me the good stuff.

02:33:34.603 --> 02:33:35.443
[SPEAKER_04]: And send me the beard.

02:33:35.764 --> 02:33:36.164
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

02:33:37.324 --> 02:33:39.726
[SPEAKER_06]: You would not be able to... Alan can rock the beard.

02:33:40.208 --> 02:33:40.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan can't rock the beard.

02:33:41.228 --> 02:33:42.169
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can rock the beard.

02:33:42.189 --> 02:33:42.829
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't rock the beard.

02:33:42.849 --> 02:33:43.729
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got that baby face.

02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:45.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww.

02:33:45.530 --> 02:33:45.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

02:33:46.571 --> 02:33:49.192
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, I didn't think Dan could rock a beard, but now he's got the goatee of doom.

02:33:49.212 --> 02:33:50.092
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

02:33:50.672 --> 02:33:53.753
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days, I'm just going to shave my head, and then I'll have the beard, and we'll see what happens.

02:33:53.773 --> 02:33:54.234
[SPEAKER_06]: He has too lumpy.

02:33:54.834 --> 02:33:57.435
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I'm not going to have a choice soon enough.

02:33:57.875 --> 02:34:00.676
[SPEAKER_06]: You could totally pull a Shatner and get the fake toupee.

02:34:01.196 --> 02:34:01.776
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

02:34:01.796 --> 02:34:02.657
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you a Tribble.

02:34:03.777 --> 02:34:03.937
[SPEAKER_04]: Inhale.

02:34:03.977 --> 02:34:08.179
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can pop you on the head and go, Rob Hart's.

02:34:09.455 --> 02:34:10.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

02:34:11.016 --> 02:34:12.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR, it's Spazinator again.

02:34:12.458 --> 02:34:17.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Spazinator was one of the ones who sent me the big email from Sony, but this is the part that I'm going to read.

02:34:18.522 --> 02:34:19.863
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR, it's Spazinator again.

02:34:19.903 --> 02:34:23.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the second email, but I have a question for you regarding the PSN press release from 4.30.

02:34:23.887 --> 02:34:27.249
[SPEAKER_06]: The wording in one section has me a little confused.

02:34:27.329 --> 02:34:28.610
[SPEAKER_06]: It states as follows.

02:34:29.051 --> 02:34:36.497
[SPEAKER_06]: The company also expedited an already planned move of the system to a new data center in a different location that has been under construction and development for several months.

02:34:36.877 --> 02:34:37.778
[SPEAKER_06]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8, PS9, PS10

02:34:58.954 --> 02:35:11.903
[SPEAKER_06]: When they say that the password can only be changed on the same PS3 in which the account was activated, do they mean the PS3 in which you initially created the account, or if you, for the sake of this email, were on your fourth PS3 and had previously successfully activated your account for the current PS3?

02:35:12.264 --> 02:35:14.805
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, the original one, but you'll be able to do it through email as well.

02:35:15.466 --> 02:35:23.992
[SPEAKER_04]: If your original one died or whatever, you replaced it with a slim, whatever you did, you're not screwed, as long as you can still log into the email account that you use for PlayStation Network.

02:35:24.528 --> 02:35:34.814
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask this because I have two PSN accounts, Spazinator and Movie underscore profile, and neither account were initially created on my current PS3, although I've had these profiles on my PS3 since Sony sent it to me.

02:35:35.555 --> 02:35:47.302
[SPEAKER_06]: With one profile, the email address is current, up-to-date, and easily accessible, but for the other, I still have the old Final Fantasy XI slash POL, I guess that's Play Online, email address associated with it.

02:35:47.802 --> 02:35:50.504
[SPEAKER_06]: and I haven't used that in a couple of years.

02:35:50.744 --> 02:35:52.124
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I'm both confused and concerned.

02:35:52.605 --> 02:35:54.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you please enlighten me on this issue?

02:35:54.065 --> 02:35:54.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you in advance.

02:35:54.706 --> 02:35:56.707
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can actually still get into your PlayOnline email.

02:35:57.607 --> 02:35:58.288
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to.

02:36:00.729 --> 02:36:02.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony SOE was not affected.

02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:06.772
[SPEAKER_04]: They went down for a little bit but their information was fine and that would include PlayOnline.

02:36:08.624 --> 02:36:10.105
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, we're almost done.

02:36:10.605 --> 02:36:18.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one from Robert M. From what footage I've seen of Portal 2, how would you say it's fair to compare the ambience to that of Bioshock?

02:36:18.390 --> 02:36:20.251
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't played either yet, but hope to soon.

02:36:20.911 --> 02:36:24.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Bioshock is a little bit more doom and gloom ominous.

02:36:25.454 --> 02:36:32.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock strikes me as a little more steampunk, whereas Portal's just a little more... And it's a little bit more on the psychological horror.

02:36:33.479 --> 02:36:34.760
[SPEAKER_06]: But Portal is the...

02:36:35.245 --> 02:36:37.647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely like Science Lab from old to new.

02:36:37.948 --> 02:36:39.309
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how else to describe it.

02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:41.651
[SPEAKER_06]: With that quirky humor.

02:36:41.791 --> 02:36:44.334
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock, you know, keep in mind there's blood in Bioshock.

02:36:44.894 --> 02:36:46.036
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not in Portal.

02:36:46.256 --> 02:36:47.837
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal is really more of a puzzle game.

02:36:48.158 --> 02:36:51.241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can die in Portal, but you don't die in, like, gruesome ways.

02:36:51.721 --> 02:36:53.142
[SPEAKER_06]: No, more like you drown or get shot.

02:36:53.343 --> 02:36:53.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:36:53.703 --> 02:36:54.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, by lasers.

02:36:54.684 --> 02:36:54.884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:36:55.565 --> 02:36:57.687
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think about it, Mario...

02:36:59.421 --> 02:37:03.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Only, you know, he dies from drowning in water or falling off a cliff, you know.

02:37:04.206 --> 02:37:07.450
[SPEAKER_04]: Characters die in games, but sometimes it's violent and sometimes it's not.

02:37:08.972 --> 02:37:10.033
[SPEAKER_06]: That is finally it!

02:37:12.128 --> 02:37:12.548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

02:37:13.368 --> 02:37:13.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yarp.

02:37:14.209 --> 02:37:15.289
[SPEAKER_06]: I read 11 emails.

02:37:15.389 --> 02:37:20.071
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Send us more emails.

02:37:20.151 --> 02:37:21.312
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us things to talk about.

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:25.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, no food incentive for next week, but we'll think of something in the future.

02:37:25.433 --> 02:37:26.474
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll have a special week.

02:37:26.734 --> 02:37:28.894
[SPEAKER_04]: But this time, DarkSakura's buying me something, okay?

02:37:28.914 --> 02:37:30.055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

02:37:30.975 --> 02:37:31.776
[SPEAKER_04]: I want tacos.

02:37:31.796 --> 02:37:32.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I want pinkberry.

02:37:33.136 --> 02:37:35.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Send 10 emails so I can get pinkberry.

02:37:35.357 --> 02:37:35.897
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

02:37:36.557 --> 02:37:40.559
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, everybody knows tacos, but not everybody understands pinkberry.

02:37:41.297 --> 02:37:41.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinkberries.

02:37:41.937 --> 02:37:43.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, we got one last minute email.

02:37:44.518 --> 02:37:45.398
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's short, so I'll read it.

02:37:45.698 --> 02:37:46.298
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

02:37:46.638 --> 02:37:49.499
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I just wanted to chime in so Jamie could get some tacos.

02:37:49.899 --> 02:37:50.939
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not get tacos.

02:37:51.059 --> 02:37:52.660
[SPEAKER_06]: I got taco, but it was a big taco.

02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:53.920
[SPEAKER_04]: That was her request, too.

02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:56.841
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked her what she wanted and she said she wants a fish taco.

02:37:57.061 --> 02:37:57.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:37:59.321 --> 02:38:00.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Fish tacos are great.

02:38:01.602 --> 02:38:09.885
[SPEAKER_06]: What is likely one of the main console developers would cease to exist and what is the likelihood new console developers could enter the market?

02:38:10.385 --> 02:38:11.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks guys for a great show as always.

02:38:11.746 --> 02:38:13.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope Jamie gets tacos till her tummy explodes.

02:38:13.866 --> 02:38:16.027
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your rants and very logical points of view, Loki.

02:38:16.687 --> 02:38:19.688
[SPEAKER_06]: This message brought to you by typing on a PSP sucks!

02:38:19.868 --> 02:38:20.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again, guys.

02:38:20.849 --> 02:38:21.169
[SPEAKER_06]: Blade 3.

02:38:23.082 --> 02:38:27.526
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the likelihood that a main console developer would cease to exist?

02:38:27.566 --> 02:38:30.068
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the likelihood that a new console developer could come in?

02:38:30.568 --> 02:38:33.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm going to go back and use Sega.

02:38:35.192 --> 02:38:36.153
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have Sega.

02:38:36.993 --> 02:38:38.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it Sammy Sega now?

02:38:39.415 --> 02:38:42.798
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did stop developing consoles.

02:38:43.459 --> 02:38:47.562
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still around, but we don't have them as a console developer anymore.

02:38:49.847 --> 02:38:51.188
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good question.

02:38:52.849 --> 02:38:54.269
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to happen right now.

02:38:55.390 --> 02:38:56.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, no.

02:38:57.231 --> 02:38:59.372
[SPEAKER_04]: NEC did the TurboGrafx, right?

02:38:59.392 --> 02:39:00.553
[SPEAKER_04]: But NEC is still around.

02:39:01.313 --> 02:39:04.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, all these companies are still around, but they don't have consoles anymore.

02:39:04.475 --> 02:39:05.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:39:06.276 --> 02:39:07.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's also, you could go minor.

02:39:08.217 --> 02:39:11.079
[SPEAKER_04]: You could say Philips had the CDI, Apple had the Pippin.

02:39:11.119 --> 02:39:11.739
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnavox.

02:39:11.779 --> 02:39:14.641
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, none of these really made a splash, but they did exist.

02:39:16.922 --> 02:39:17.943
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really hard.

02:39:17.963 --> 02:39:18.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:39:18.942 --> 02:39:19.842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think quite likely.

02:39:21.163 --> 02:39:27.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the ones out now, the real newcomers would be Sony and Microsoft.

02:39:28.466 --> 02:39:29.167
[SPEAKER_04]: And Apple.

02:39:29.667 --> 02:39:32.908
[SPEAKER_04]: I still say the iBlank is a gaming device.

02:39:33.849 --> 02:39:36.350
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where a lot of portables are going.

02:39:38.591 --> 02:39:42.533
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the thing is, though, as far as someone exiting...

02:39:43.993 --> 02:39:49.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the news we've been talking about this week, when it comes to pure sales, none of the systems have been doing terribly.

02:39:50.358 --> 02:39:51.478
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them have tanked.

02:39:52.039 --> 02:39:57.963
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's usually why a company disappears, because they release a console that just tanks.

02:39:58.703 --> 02:39:59.664
[SPEAKER_06]: That really hasn't happened.

02:39:59.724 --> 02:40:00.925
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really have our big three.

02:40:01.986 --> 02:40:04.708
[SPEAKER_06]: And two of our big three are newcomers within the last...

02:40:09.584 --> 02:40:11.346
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation is about 15 years old, so yeah.

02:40:12.247 --> 02:40:16.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because that came out in 94 or 95.

02:40:19.274 --> 02:40:28.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's additions, well, contributions to the console market, they did the SNES's sound processor.

02:40:29.781 --> 02:40:35.205
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's too much for a fourth person to come in, but I think if it's going to be anyone, it's going to be Apple.

02:40:35.605 --> 02:40:42.809
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to try to sneak their stuff onto your TV through Apple TV and all this stuff more so than they already have.

02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:45.471
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's that Apple's really trying to get into gaming.

02:40:45.771 --> 02:40:46.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple's just in it to make money.

02:40:49.679 --> 02:41:16.683
[SPEAKER_04]: so we'll see but as far as one of the other three going away I don't think so one of them is going to have to release a real stinker for that to happen and I don't see any of them as particularly vulnerable right now but obviously if Nintendo is going a completely different direction with this console could be a risky move especially since 3DS didn't go up to expectations but I don't think the 3DS is doing terribly it's not doing enough where it's going to bankrupt the company yet anyway

02:41:17.042 --> 02:41:18.863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was actually, I think, a really good email.

02:41:18.923 --> 02:41:20.183
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for contributing.

02:41:23.144 --> 02:41:25.205
[SPEAKER_04]: MegaboyX in our chatroom says, Screw Apple!

02:41:25.265 --> 02:41:26.605
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what a lot of people say.

02:41:26.966 --> 02:41:30.407
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you just... I mean, facts are facts.

02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:34.028
[SPEAKER_04]: iPhone, iPads, iPods, all that shit sells really well.

02:41:34.508 --> 02:41:36.129
[SPEAKER_04]: And games are available on all of them.

02:41:36.529 --> 02:41:40.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough so that Nintendo has had to comment on it and kind of dog the competition.

02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:43.351
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they are a player.

02:41:44.372 --> 02:41:44.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

02:41:45.265 --> 02:41:46.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it for the email bag.

02:41:47.011 --> 02:41:49.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is the part of the show where we're going to get ranty.

02:41:49.339 --> 02:41:50.603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the FUs of the week.

02:41:50.804 --> 02:41:50.884
[SPEAKER_04]: Rawr!

02:42:09.188 --> 02:42:14.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my FU goes towards my last week and finals week of school.

02:42:14.711 --> 02:42:18.233
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of work to get done and not that much time to get it done in.

02:42:19.094 --> 02:42:29.560
[SPEAKER_06]: And my second FU goes towards my really weird bout of exhaustion slash insomnia that's been just making me completely wiped out and kind of burned on everything going on.

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:31.701
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll figure it out.

02:42:31.721 --> 02:42:33.442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably just end of school stress.

02:42:34.182 --> 02:42:34.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:42:35.083 --> 02:42:35.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

02:42:35.323 --> 02:42:35.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:42:37.286 --> 02:42:42.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, F you to the upcoming hot that's gonna be coming, uh, this week.

02:42:42.710 --> 02:43:00.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not hot as, you know, what we normally get, uh, but, you know, it's gonna get up to 85 degrees this week, and that's not that bad, but this time of year, though, you know, 85 feels like 105, you know, and then once we hit 105, we're begging for 85, but right now, it feels like 105, so, damn it.

02:43:03.803 --> 02:43:05.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate being hot.

02:43:05.124 --> 02:43:05.845
[SPEAKER_03]: I like being cold.

02:43:06.805 --> 02:43:07.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold's easy.

02:43:07.366 --> 02:43:08.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Put more layers on.

02:43:08.106 --> 02:43:09.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot, can't take more layers off.

02:43:10.488 --> 02:43:11.449
[SPEAKER_03]: You only take so many layers.

02:43:13.370 --> 02:43:14.871
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week, I don't know.

02:43:15.031 --> 02:43:16.272
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have been pretty good, actually.

02:43:16.552 --> 02:43:20.635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just FU to me not usually getting enough sleep at night.

02:43:20.955 --> 02:43:22.676
[SPEAKER_04]: I should stop doing that.

02:43:22.977 --> 02:43:24.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, FU to having to work on Saturday.

02:43:25.759 --> 02:43:26.960
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely worthy of an FU.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:28.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to get up early on Saturday.

02:43:29.721 --> 02:43:30.202
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

02:43:30.242 --> 02:43:30.862
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

02:43:32.323 --> 02:43:41.771
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was not forced to come in, but I did it because when people ask me nicely, I tend to do nice things, even though I might not really like them.

02:43:42.872 --> 02:43:43.872
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

02:43:44.553 --> 02:43:46.695
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into a couple more news stories.

02:43:46.735 --> 02:43:48.736
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, the Skype line.

02:43:48.836 --> 02:43:50.818
[SPEAKER_04]: I expected to be ringing off the hook tonight, but we'll see.

02:43:51.258 --> 02:43:54.381
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get into some other news.

02:43:54.461 --> 02:43:54.661
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

02:43:54.681 --> 02:43:54.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

02:43:55.061 --> 02:43:56.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is kind of funny.

02:43:57.802 --> 02:44:00.143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most annoying characters ever.

02:44:00.723 --> 02:44:03.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting kind of a return in sort of a gaming form.

02:44:04.944 --> 02:44:10.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft Office's Clippy is getting its own tutorial slash game.

02:44:12.367 --> 02:44:15.307
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Ribbon Hero 2, Clippy's Second Chance.

02:44:17.348 --> 02:44:22.250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a video game slash tutorial to kind of walk you through some of the...

02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:25.732
[SPEAKER_03]: New features of Microsoft Office.

02:44:26.273 --> 02:44:28.374
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, yes, we've turned Office into a game.

02:44:28.514 --> 02:44:33.799
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to spend time immersed in the inner workings of Office, by golly, it should be fun.

02:44:34.019 --> 02:44:39.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Discover new Office features by actually using them with hint button to fall back on in case you get stuck.

02:44:40.185 --> 02:44:43.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Race for a high score with colleagues, classmates, and friends.

02:44:43.207 --> 02:44:48.192
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put your high score on your resume to show off your Office skills.

02:44:48.552 --> 02:44:49.533
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recommend doing that.

02:44:50.534 --> 02:44:53.355
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who have been paying attention, we've done this before.

02:44:54.016 --> 02:44:56.758
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we've got the two at the end of the title.

02:44:57.138 --> 02:44:57.979
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's different?

02:44:58.719 --> 02:45:04.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Clippy, comic strips, colorful graphics, surprise animations, multiple levels, time travel, upside down.

02:45:05.204 --> 02:45:10.947
[SPEAKER_03]: Clippy, spaceships, Greek gods, bow and arrow battles, and tons of useful office features.

02:45:10.967 --> 02:45:14.370
[SPEAKER_05]: Sigh.

02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:17.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it slow down your computer insanely too?

02:45:17.881 --> 02:45:20.922
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what Clippy was always best for.

02:45:22.242 --> 02:45:22.562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:45:22.862 --> 02:45:23.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

02:45:23.343 --> 02:45:24.543
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys tonight.

02:45:24.563 --> 02:45:27.684
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's about a big, big PC game that's set to come out soon.

02:45:28.364 --> 02:45:28.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3.

02:45:29.565 --> 02:45:30.905
[SPEAKER_04]: And when is it coming out?

02:45:30.965 --> 02:45:32.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some are saying possibly 2011.

02:45:34.146 --> 02:45:37.447
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hate news stories like this because it kind of seems obvious.

02:45:37.507 --> 02:45:39.288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's either coming out this year or next.

02:45:39.328 --> 02:45:40.008
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no shit.

02:45:40.428 --> 02:45:42.049
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's what's causing the speculation.

02:45:42.069 --> 02:45:42.309
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.769
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been.

02:45:43.009 --> 02:45:44.490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either coming out this year or later.

02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:45.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:45:45.690 --> 02:45:47.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what's causing the speculation.

02:45:47.212 --> 02:45:50.755
[SPEAKER_04]: The game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, said this to the New York Times.

02:45:51.116 --> 02:45:51.436
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote,

02:45:57.168 --> 02:46:25.958
[SPEAKER_04]: but I mean for Blizzard shit that could mean anything I hope it's this year I would love to be playing Diablo 3 by Christmas I'm hoping BlizzCon will shed some light on that especially since they're not going to be releasing a WoW expansion this year they may have a StarCraft 2 expansion but otherwise there's nothing for Blizzard to release this year so I sort of hope it is Diablo 3 I would say it's got to release in the well they have a new MMO they're working on yeah but that's not coming out for until like 2013 doesn't mean they can't announce it they can announce it but it won't make them money

02:46:26.398 --> 02:46:26.898
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

02:46:47.250 --> 02:46:51.695
[SPEAKER_04]: People paying to watch what they should be able to see at E3 on TV for free.

02:46:53.637 --> 02:46:56.259
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love the Blizzard products.

02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:59.683
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't loved them as much since Activision bought them.

02:46:59.723 --> 02:47:02.426
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, if you want to know more about that, go listen to the other show.

02:47:02.866 --> 02:47:05.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's get into the calls.

02:47:05.469 --> 02:47:09.513
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:09.533 --> 02:47:10.394
[SPEAKER_04]: The phones are open.

02:47:10.834 --> 02:47:30.915
[SPEAKER_04]: PSN, Xbox, whatever you want to talk about in the gaming world give us a call, we'll let you talk for a minute here Kaijudo in our chatroom says I think Diablo 3 is going to be a letdown I really hope not there's a part of me that doesn't want to argue with you because you might be right, but I really hope not I hope you're wrong I think it won't be worth the development time put it that way

02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:33.001
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

02:47:33.081 --> 02:47:35.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard doesn't really seem to put out bad games, though.

02:47:35.682 --> 02:47:37.263
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, StarCraft II is still really good.

02:47:37.643 --> 02:47:41.405
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW has all been great, but then again, Cataclysm did have a lot of problems.

02:47:41.545 --> 02:47:43.626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been the weakest WoW expansion so far.

02:47:44.106 --> 02:47:55.532
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't lived through its life expectancy yet, but so far, it has not WoWed people, ironic, across the spectrum that the other expansions have, I would say.

02:47:56.593 --> 02:48:00.735
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ in chat says, I have zero hopes that it's coming out until it's in my hands!

02:48:03.012 --> 02:48:04.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may be waiting for a little while.

02:48:04.114 --> 02:48:04.434
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

02:48:04.895 --> 02:48:06.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

02:48:07.038 --> 02:48:08.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:08.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:48:09.743 --> 02:48:10.664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Deathwishing.

02:48:10.904 --> 02:48:12.287
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Deathwishing, how are you?

02:48:13.208 --> 02:48:14.991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty good.

02:48:16.733 --> 02:48:17.515
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to comment.

02:48:18.635 --> 02:48:18.975
[SPEAKER_04]: PSN Stuff

02:48:48.447 --> 02:48:50.829
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?

02:48:50.989 --> 02:49:02.156
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess PlayStation Network feels that they're obligated to give free stuff on a free service to all the whiny 4chan babies.

02:49:03.597 --> 02:49:06.919
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't think they should be giving anything at all?

02:49:07.019 --> 02:49:11.622
[SPEAKER_01]: I only think they should be giving reimbursements to the people that pay for PlayStation Plus, you know?

02:49:11.722 --> 02:49:15.845
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that pay for services like DC Online and...

02:49:16.567 --> 02:49:38.271
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, paying customers not like, everyone gets free stuff because you all bitch but we're gonna say we're polite it's, I don't know, it kind of and then the fact that I can't play SOCOM 4 now be honest, are you, now see usually that sort of reaction comes from what you would call a Sony fanboy so be honest, are you a Sony fanboy?

02:49:40.451 --> 02:49:46.012
[SPEAKER_01]: I own all systems, but I really I mean, I kind of like it because I can

02:49:46.567 --> 02:49:48.568
[SPEAKER_01]: Get PlayStation Plus for free now just to try it out.

02:49:48.648 --> 02:49:52.469
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess I kind of am a Sony fanboy.

02:49:52.729 --> 02:49:53.009
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:49:53.029 --> 02:49:53.429
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

02:49:53.469 --> 02:49:53.709
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

02:49:53.769 --> 02:49:54.009
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:57.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, what did you think of all this, the hacking and all that?

02:49:57.471 --> 02:50:00.131
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as a Sony fanboy, are you like, this could happen to anyone?

02:50:00.672 --> 02:50:03.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you like, wow, maybe Sony kind of asked for this?

02:50:03.692 --> 02:50:06.533
[SPEAKER_01]: I first went, wow, holy shit, I can't believe this happened.

02:50:06.633 --> 02:50:14.476
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I saw, oh, we didn't have encrypted stuff, I kind of just went, Sony, you set yourself up to this, you morons.

02:50:15.387 --> 02:50:30.680
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you would think a company with all this money, with services all, you know, in this age of day that has a service where, okay, we have for the developers, we can buy all each other's games off our PlayStation Network, but we're gonna keep it on the same server, because that's the smart thing to do.

02:50:32.321 --> 02:50:35.064
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, guys, we're hacked now, and guess what, your credit card's out.

02:50:35.684 --> 02:50:39.988
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole thing with the way they worked the information, that just pissed me off too, it's like the United States.

02:50:42.423 --> 02:50:43.023
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I love.

02:50:46.645 --> 02:50:54.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you agree with what we were saying earlier in the show about Sony is just hard-headed?

02:50:56.711 --> 02:50:57.551
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very much so.

02:50:58.492 --> 02:50:58.972
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it?

02:50:59.232 --> 02:51:06.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Sony just drunk with power from the rampant success of the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2?

02:51:09.278 --> 02:51:09.558
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

02:51:10.143 --> 02:51:11.284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so that.

02:51:11.344 --> 02:51:20.489
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what they're trying to, you know, they're too afraid of the 599 US dollar system being, like, compromised, you know?

02:51:22.050 --> 02:51:22.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

02:51:22.391 --> 02:51:27.974
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm talking about here, how it's like, oh, we have such an expensive system, oh shit, we fucked up, uh...

02:51:29.818 --> 02:51:34.201
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that whole not encrypting the data is going to be a real thing that comes back to bite them in the ass.

02:51:34.321 --> 02:51:38.084
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if this thing does go to trial, that's going to be the piece that screws them.

02:51:38.104 --> 02:51:39.965
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw the stock prices go down, right?

02:51:40.706 --> 02:51:41.667
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

02:51:41.927 --> 02:51:43.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course their stock price is going to go down.

02:51:43.928 --> 02:51:45.149
[SPEAKER_01]: It already bit them.

02:51:45.570 --> 02:51:45.990
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:49.552
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially how much of big releases for them came out that week, too.

02:51:49.573 --> 02:51:52.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence me buying actually one of those releases and not being able to play it.

02:51:54.327 --> 02:51:56.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:51:56.488 --> 02:51:58.129
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on with SOCOM right now?

02:51:58.169 --> 02:51:59.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Does SOCOM even have a single player?

02:51:59.911 --> 02:52:00.471
[SPEAKER_04]: It does, right?

02:52:02.912 --> 02:52:05.714
[SPEAKER_01]: Um... If you can call it that.

02:52:07.355 --> 02:52:08.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting question.

02:52:08.436 --> 02:52:11.077
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this comment from Bonds006 in the chatroom.

02:52:11.598 --> 02:52:16.561
[SPEAKER_04]: If any one of us was working in the higher ranks of Sony, would we do something different?

02:52:18.982 --> 02:52:23.765
[SPEAKER_01]: I told... I mean, I was trying to get... If I was in the higher ranks, I would have ran up to the frickin'

02:52:25.074 --> 02:52:28.157
[SPEAKER_01]: IT people in there and punch them all in the dick.

02:52:30.299 --> 02:52:31.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:39.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if I were Kaz Harai, I would have promptly fired the person in IT and I would have announced to the world that that's what we did and that's what we're going to change.

02:52:40.607 --> 02:52:41.328
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know.

02:52:43.050 --> 02:52:45.832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, yeah, that's I think what I would have done too.

02:52:45.852 --> 02:52:48.334
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I would have punched them in the dick, but maybe with words.

02:52:48.474 --> 02:52:51.177
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, they had it coming.

02:52:51.797 --> 02:52:52.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

02:52:52.598 --> 02:52:52.758
[SPEAKER_01]: But,

02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:59.682
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox fanboys, your service did go down for three weeks in 2007 too, so... Three weeks?

02:52:59.942 --> 02:53:01.963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember Xbox being down for three weeks.

02:53:02.603 --> 02:53:03.343
[SPEAKER_01]: Three days, maybe.

02:53:03.363 --> 02:53:03.803
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in 2007.

02:53:03.983 --> 02:53:08.445
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do over, like, December, like, a shitload of people rushed online because they got their Xboxes.

02:53:09.411 --> 02:53:10.351
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like three days.

02:53:10.391 --> 02:53:11.392
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not three weeks.

02:53:11.712 --> 02:53:13.172
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was three weeks.

02:53:13.192 --> 02:53:13.952
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you're wrong.

02:53:13.972 --> 02:53:17.353
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like three days, three weeks of getting the network back up fully running.

02:53:17.493 --> 02:53:20.714
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get the Xbox fanboys, you need to go to the Red Ring of Death.

02:53:20.794 --> 02:53:22.735
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, because that was terrible.

02:53:22.835 --> 02:53:26.776
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Microsoft handled it much better than Sony's handling it so far.

02:53:27.656 --> 02:53:28.817
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.

02:53:29.617 --> 02:53:29.797
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

02:53:30.237 --> 02:53:30.637
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow.

02:53:30.677 --> 02:53:31.837
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good in the tent.

02:53:31.897 --> 02:53:33.118
[SPEAKER_01]: At least everything may have Prince money.

02:53:33.398 --> 02:53:33.658
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:53:33.718 --> 02:53:35.198
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to let you go so we can get more calls.

02:53:35.258 --> 02:53:36.299
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're breaking up a little bit anyway.

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:37.019
[SPEAKER_04]: So take care, buddy.

02:53:39.178 --> 02:53:39.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye!

02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:11.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, KNS.

02:54:11.884 --> 02:54:12.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

02:54:12.385 --> 02:54:13.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who's this?

02:54:15.028 --> 02:54:15.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, can you hear me?

02:54:16.029 --> 02:54:16.410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:17.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who is this?

02:54:17.972 --> 02:54:18.873
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bad echo.

02:54:18.893 --> 02:54:20.675
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, that's a problem.

02:54:20.695 --> 02:54:21.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a second.

02:54:21.356 --> 02:54:21.717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

02:54:22.878 --> 02:54:24.480
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't expect you guys to pick up that quick.

02:54:24.681 --> 02:54:25.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, we'll hold.

02:54:28.390 --> 02:54:29.130
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:54:59.285 --> 02:55:27.966
[SPEAKER_04]: forgive me if you already touched on this I was in and out of the room yeah I know there's a lot of news going on in the world it's fine did you weigh in on the show about IGN's little fake or gay article no there was a part of me that didn't want to go there but if the listeners want to go there then fine why don't you do some reporting on this tell us a little bit about what happened and how you feel about it

02:55:29.335 --> 02:55:43.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically IGN took the time to write a little article detailing the sexuality of Yoshi and Turok, of all people.

02:55:45.090 --> 02:56:14.134
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically they went through this whole long detailed article explaining that Yoshi is, I believe they used the phrase technically queer or something to that effect because he is dating Birdo who apparently is a transsexual if I got the article right my browser is kind of going slow there for a minute

02:56:16.573 --> 02:56:18.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so yeah.

02:56:19.297 --> 02:56:22.883
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told on Twitter that the article was actually written by somebody who is gay.

02:56:24.127 --> 02:56:25.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes it stranger.

02:56:25.387 --> 02:56:26.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

02:56:26.027 --> 02:56:27.128
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the whole thing weirder.

02:56:27.668 --> 02:56:32.189
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, as I mentioned on Twitter, articles are written to generate hits.

02:56:32.369 --> 02:56:34.409
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one reason why I wouldn't link it for my Twitter.

02:56:34.470 --> 02:56:36.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.

02:56:36.590 --> 02:56:42.011
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think these sorts of rampant speculation, I don't know, it just adds fuel to all that stuff.

02:56:42.051 --> 02:56:43.472
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just unnecessary.

02:56:43.772 --> 02:56:48.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you want to write an interesting article about sexuality, why not talk about, like...

02:56:49.933 --> 02:56:55.614
[SPEAKER_04]: The impact of that, or why are more games kind of not putting it in their storylines?

02:56:55.734 --> 02:57:00.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what is it that gay folks want in gaming?

02:57:00.175 --> 02:57:01.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like interview them.

02:57:01.635 --> 02:57:04.116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the same thing as everyone else, to be honest, I'll tell you that.

02:57:04.436 --> 02:57:04.956
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know.

02:57:05.016 --> 02:57:07.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an article like that just seemed like so unnecessary.

02:57:07.176 --> 02:57:15.258
[SPEAKER_04]: Or give us an article with a developer for Dragon Age or one of those studios that actually put a gay character in the game about kind of like how they did it and how they made sure...

02:57:15.678 --> 02:57:21.019
[SPEAKER_04]: to kind of address the sensitivity by making it realistic without being a joke.

02:57:21.639 --> 02:57:22.219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:30.321
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than like, oh, Birdo's gay because of a misprint that was in an instruction manual so many years ago because they used to rush the translation.

02:57:30.341 --> 02:57:31.361
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's stupid.

02:57:31.441 --> 02:57:34.662
[SPEAKER_06]: But it actually has been official that Birdo is transgendered.

02:57:35.762 --> 02:57:36.462
[SPEAKER_02]: But still.

02:57:36.602 --> 02:57:40.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that confirmed in Captain Rainbow or something like that?

02:57:40.163 --> 02:57:43.884
[SPEAKER_02]: That Nintendo Wii game that only came out in Japan several years ago?

02:57:45.579 --> 02:57:51.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's plenty of folks that would argue that just because you date somebody who's transsexual doesn't make you one sexuality or another.

02:57:51.284 --> 02:57:53.927
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people just care too much about who's gay and who's straight.

02:57:54.067 --> 02:57:57.490
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just love whoever you want to love and be over it, you know?

02:57:58.190 --> 02:57:59.311
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just me.

02:58:02.094 --> 02:58:03.335
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for equal rights.

02:58:05.337 --> 02:58:06.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what did you think when you read the article?

02:58:06.898 --> 02:58:10.241
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it piss you off or were you like, eh, too many people are getting their panties ruffled over this?

02:58:13.052 --> 02:58:26.199
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first saw on IGN's Twitter, when I first saw the title of this, I didn't even have to click on it before I'm thinking, what are they fucking doing?

02:58:26.519 --> 02:58:30.101
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just seemed like a desperate grab for hits.

02:58:31.830 --> 02:58:34.631
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unnecessary.

02:58:35.392 --> 02:58:38.573
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just seemed like pure bullshit to me.

02:58:39.954 --> 02:58:45.416
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not an article that they needed to write.

02:58:46.237 --> 02:58:48.038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an editorial they needed to write.

02:58:50.159 --> 02:58:55.861
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at our chatroom here and MegaBoyX is in our chatroom saying, yeah, the guy on IGN came out as gay recently.

02:58:56.241 --> 02:58:58.162
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just trying to write a fun article about it.

02:58:58.382 --> 02:58:59.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:58:59.022 --> 02:59:04.203
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, I'm just kind of like, well, why not write an article about coming out as gay then in gaming culture?

02:59:04.363 --> 02:59:05.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, why not?

02:59:05.864 --> 02:59:08.084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, is Yoshi gay?

02:59:08.245 --> 02:59:09.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this so weird?

02:59:09.905 --> 02:59:10.245
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:59:10.305 --> 02:59:11.305
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unnecessary.

02:59:11.465 --> 02:59:12.346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unnecessary.

02:59:12.486 --> 02:59:15.067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I think, the best thing I can think of to describe it.

02:59:15.187 --> 02:59:16.127
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just unnecessary.

02:59:18.296 --> 02:59:25.768
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they were kind of joking about whether Yoshi was a man or a woman in Super Smash Bros.

02:59:26.509 --> 02:59:30.776
[SPEAKER_02]: during Snake and Otacon's conversation before a fight with Yoshi.

02:59:33.497 --> 02:59:41.643
[SPEAKER_02]: and I remember them just bickering back and forth about Buddy lays eggs but it's a boy.

02:59:43.064 --> 02:59:43.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

02:59:44.024 --> 02:59:47.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we gotta let you go to get some more calls but do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:59:49.088 --> 02:59:54.411
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell Defective Candy thank you for I tell you what I want what I really really want over Twitter.

02:59:55.292 --> 02:59:58.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well I have one final thought for you along those lines.

03:00:04.403 --> 03:00:06.584
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not Viva Forever.

03:00:30.078 --> 03:00:31.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why you would be buying the collection now.

03:00:32.018 --> 03:00:34.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe because Final Fantasy XIV is still broken.

03:00:34.599 --> 03:00:39.220
[SPEAKER_03]: But Final Fantasy XI, if you happen to want to join that right now, there's actually a good collection they have out there.

03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:44.401
[SPEAKER_03]: They updated their Ultimate Collection now with the Abysia Edition.

03:00:44.421 --> 03:00:51.843
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes basically the game, plus all the expansions, plus the extra Abysia items.

03:00:53.243 --> 03:00:55.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess expansions.

03:00:55.425 --> 03:00:56.926
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three add-on scenarios.

03:00:57.226 --> 03:00:57.466
[SPEAKER_03]: All for $20.

03:00:57.807 --> 03:01:01.129
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki, I want you to point at me and get ready to laugh.

03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

03:01:01.650 --> 03:01:03.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I kind of want to go back and play.

03:01:03.791 --> 03:01:05.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for a couple weeks.

03:01:05.773 --> 03:01:09.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to relive old times.

03:01:09.235 --> 03:01:10.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Like revisiting an old friend.

03:01:10.556 --> 03:01:20.204
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, you do get a special beret that I guess will increase skill gain, extra movement speed, and both magic and health regeneration.

03:01:23.027 --> 03:01:25.888
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess a new edition will be available to download May 16th.

03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:29.170
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:34.553
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a small part of me that kind of wants to go hug an old friend.

03:01:37.775 --> 03:01:43.739
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's rumor that Ocarina of Time 3D is going to be a limited initial release.

03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:45.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

03:01:46.260 --> 03:01:51.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, other than them being disappointed about the 3DS launch numbers...

03:01:53.283 --> 03:01:55.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that?

03:01:56.067 --> 03:02:00.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it extremely small so that people are trying to find it?

03:02:01.193 --> 03:02:03.215
[SPEAKER_03]: See, Nintendo toys with their customers like that.

03:02:03.496 --> 03:02:04.837
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of company they are.

03:02:05.118 --> 03:02:05.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

03:02:06.139 --> 03:02:06.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you what.

03:02:07.380 --> 03:02:11.526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll free up one extra copy for those people looking for it because I'm not buying it.

03:02:14.818 --> 03:02:30.109
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, if you don't like Madden, yet you still want a football game, All Pro Football 2K8, there's an editor that's been released for it, for the Xbox 360 version, using some file editing.

03:02:30.489 --> 03:02:32.811
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can be done on non-modded consoles, by the way.

03:02:34.132 --> 03:02:36.594
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually update your rosters.

03:02:37.374 --> 03:02:39.696
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also create custom teams.

03:02:40.356 --> 03:02:44.980
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess adjusting stats and players and all that stuff.

03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:51.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratings, abilities, physical appearance, and basically create your own teams if you want.

03:02:52.906 --> 03:02:55.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Or base them off of the actual NFL teams.

03:02:57.609 --> 03:03:00.572
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure All-Pro Football 2K8 is probably dirt cheap nowadays.

03:03:00.592 --> 03:03:00.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

03:03:03.755 --> 03:03:08.061
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in that, check out operationsports.com.

03:03:08.161 --> 03:03:09.382
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a feature running on it.

03:03:09.462 --> 03:03:13.748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Flying Finn Releases All-Pro Football 2K8 Editor.

03:03:15.765 --> 03:03:16.145
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

03:03:41.167 --> 03:03:45.618
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what do we talk about for a few more minutes while we wait for the phones to ring?

03:03:45.638 --> 03:03:47.002
[SPEAKER_06]: This is such a funny image.

03:03:49.054 --> 03:03:53.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one of the... Yeah, someone finally did like a little image of Obama.

03:03:53.297 --> 03:03:55.798
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, sorry it took so long to get you a copy of my birth certificate.

03:03:55.878 --> 03:03:57.659
[SPEAKER_06]: I was too busy killing Osama Bin Laden.

03:03:58.360 --> 03:03:59.200
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

03:03:59.860 --> 03:04:00.281
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

03:04:01.641 --> 03:04:01.982
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

03:04:02.342 --> 03:04:06.684
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to... I have things I want to say, but I don't want to get too political on the show.

03:04:06.864 --> 03:04:12.948
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just... I just hope that this will be the first step in this all being over.

03:04:13.528 --> 03:04:14.989
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I'll say on that.

03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:17.110
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

03:04:18.331 --> 03:04:20.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess that's it.

03:04:20.793 --> 03:04:21.233
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done.

03:04:21.333 --> 03:04:23.715
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and close up the lines.

03:04:23.755 --> 03:04:26.517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1230 on the East Coast anyway, so we're done.

03:04:26.937 --> 03:04:29.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

03:04:29.499 --> 03:04:30.720
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, let me also say this.

03:04:32.542 --> 03:04:37.265
[SPEAKER_04]: If you liked Orange Lounge Radio, if you like the show here, do help spread the word about the show.

03:04:37.585 --> 03:04:40.788
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend or a nice five-star review on iTunes is great too.

03:04:41.028 --> 03:04:42.989
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some really nice ones written in the past couple days.

03:04:43.069 --> 03:04:43.990

03:04:50.054 --> 03:04:51.775
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go around and give everybody's final thought.

03:04:52.155 --> 03:04:54.756

03:04:59.859 --> 03:05:00.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Chapter 2.

03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:01.340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting into it.

03:05:03.041 --> 03:05:05.703

03:05:07.143 --> 03:05:07.464
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

03:05:07.924 --> 03:05:08.164
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

03:05:08.664 --> 03:05:10.125
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Baskin Robbins around the corner.

03:05:10.485 --> 03:05:13.287
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but they'll be closed by the time we're done with Afterbirth and all that.

03:05:13.769 --> 03:05:14.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it guys.

03:05:14.889 --> 03:05:16.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for listening to the show.

03:05:16.590 --> 03:05:20.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope that PSN comes back in the next week and maybe we'll forget about it by next week.

03:05:21.132 --> 03:05:21.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Likely not.

03:05:21.992 --> 03:05:25.233
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the latest in gaming news and all the good stuff and your voices.

03:05:26.014 --> 03:05:27.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, same bat time, same bat channel.

03:05:28.014 --> 03:05:28.715

03:05:28.735 --> 03:05:29.275
