{"text": " Tonight, June 8th, 2011, we bring you further impressions and opinions on E3 Live with special correspondents Bobby Black Wolf and Miek Latov on the show floor. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to night number two of E3 Live coverage here at Orange Lounge Radio in conjunction with Ustream, our little temporary home for the shows and of course the one and only Bobby Black Wolf who does his own show on Sunday nights and is also syndicating the show to his feed as well as our feed so it's just it's just all out there for everybody so I'm glad you guys are enjoying it. My name is Rob Roberts I'll be joining you over the next hour hour and a half however long we go tonight with my co-hosts here in the studio say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura. Carrot. So you've gone from meat last night to carrot tonight. Yes because I want something crunchy. All right and also joining us tonight say hello to Dan the man is here in studio. Hello hello. How you doing? I'm doing good. Good you're on Loki's night so or excuse me Loki's mic so you're not as loud as you were last night. I get to sit in my own desk. The guest mic is so freaky in here but oh well nobody cares about that. I blame you. We are live of course live on Ustream if this is your first time listening to us here on Ustream this is not where we're usually at we do a Sunday night live show every week at All Games Radio. More information about our podcast and all that good stuff www.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen to last night's two and a half hour opus of the Wii U and Xbox and Kinect and and the Vita. We're gonna actually get more into the Vita tonight. It is live of course you can join us in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com if you have any live comments you want to give us as we're broadcasting here live. Speaking of live sometimes interesting things happen and we actually have to mix things up a little bit tonight. We're not gonna start with Bobby tonight. Bobby's caught in traffic. He's still in LA downtown. I guess the last text I got is that a transformer blew out somewhere. So sorry Bobby fans we're gonna have to go to him a little later but we're gonna go right into today's coverage of E3 and from what I understand our correspondents out on the floor got some more hands-on impressions today. As you know yesterday Bobby waited for quite a while in that Wii U Wii U Wii U line to about what like four hours to finally get his hands on the Wii U and gave us his impressions yesterday. Tonight we're gonna go straight over to Miek Letov who was on the show floor and I think he was waiting for like three or four hours today to play the PS Vita. So it's kind of interesting that both of them have very long lines waiting to play them. So we're gonna go to Miek Letov right now through the magic of the internet we're gonna call his little cell phone and see what else he played today because I know the show hours are usually longest on this second day so hopefully got to play a lot more today. I don't know if he got to go play more Konami stuff like Silent Hill which he said it wasn't that great which made Jamie sad. Very sad in my soul. But of course it's just his opinion it's just one opinion so we'll see maybe Bobby got to play it today we'll see if he thought the same thing. Hello? Hey is this Miek Letov? Yes. Hey it's Rob from Orange Launch Radio of course you should know that I just texted you thanks for letting us. I know it's so surprising. Thanks for letting us mix things up a little bit and bringing you on first tonight. Bobby's caught in traffic where are you are you are you back at your hotel? Yes I made it back. It's fine after 50 minutes of commuting. Do you how do you get now yeah for those who have never been to E3 and have heard about LA traffic it really is a nightmare that's why I'm not looking forward to being in it tomorrow when we go to pick Bobby up at the convention center but uh it'll be all right. At least we'll have each other right Dark Sakura? Yes. Right Dan? Of course. All right anyway so Miek Letov how was E3 for you today? It was well I would say I only really participated in E3 today for about three hours if that because today was my stand-in-line day. Today was your stand-in-line day so I already mentioned that I know you stood in line for the PS Vita right? Yep. Good I'm glad we get to talk about because yesterday was a little bit Nintendo heavy with all the Wii U talks so I'm glad we get to talk a little bit about the PS Vita today so tell us about your experiences everything from standing in line how long to when you finally got your hands on the goods? It took about four hours for me to get through that line and I got there at about 10 30 so it was a bit ridiculous for the line but to make up for it if you can consider it that I did play with it for about 20 minutes so I got some good hands-on time with it. Not bad yeah what are your thoughts? I really like it it's definitely a great successor to the PSP for the design part of the system the screen is beautiful it's really big it's really vibrant you really don't see any pixels whatsoever definitely a nice high-desk screen the the back part with the touchpad I don't like that so much because the touchpad takes up too much of the back so you're constantly accidentally tapping it and in the game that you know you use the touchpad on the back can kind of screw you up but that's just a minor uh minor complaint I'm sure if I held it the right way because it's grips it would be a little bit better. I wonder if you can just turn that crap off do you think do you think you just turn off that back touchpad altogether because I didn't even think about that but yeah if you have a tendency like tap on the back of your device or something it's going to totally mess with that back touch stuff right? Yeah it will um I assume that some games will have that I don't think it will be a system setting but so yeah there's that part and the one thing that I actually do not like about the system is that the face buttons are way too small like I was playing Uncharted and I kept trying to hit the x button but instead I'd hit an analog stick because that's where my fingers felt like the x button should be instead of these really tiny little buttons that they give you to play with. So it sounds like maybe there's some design things that need to be worked out or is this is this pretty much like the final thing that you guys are seeing did they say anything about prototype or how far along it is? Um I did not ask and they did not say I assume because of how close to I mean really if you think about if it's supposed to be this this holiday it's only a few months out so I'm pretty sure that this is probably the final design. I thought the ds was shown and it went through a lot of changes I mean this is many years ago it was shown at e3 and it went through many changes before it was released uh but maybe not because I think that might have come out the ds came out what March or April I guess so thinking of the ds as being many years ago is sad I know that was my first e3 I think all of ours was the year the ds was yeah anyhow uh so okay so this isn't about the ps or the ds though it's about the ps vita um so tell us about some of the games that you play and what they were like okay they had a station set up for us to go to about five minutes on each or was it four I don't remember I can't remember the amount of stations but I'll whisk them off um the first one we went to was the little big planet station so we got to play um or you got your choice of a couple different um options in little big planet you could play a stage or you could play um a two player game using just a touch screen and you would play with the demo guy I opted to do just the stage because I wanted to see how it would really work in the practical play um and I was really impressed uh I used everything from the the touchpad to tilting the system or not touchpad sorry the touch screen to tilting the system and it played like little big planet and it looked like little big planet on the ps3 so like I was really impressed um one of the puzzles that had me do was there was a keyboard in the background and I had to play or I had to push the keys for the musical note and then LBP and it opened the door and I thought that was really cool uh and so you say it looked just like little big planet on the ps3 so did it feel like it was just kind of a port of the ps3 you know original with maybe some uh frills that incorporate the vita stuff like the the back touching or whatever did it feel like like just a whole separate experience like it's not you know just a port I would say it felt more like a separate experience because the vita special features really made it feel that way um so like there was a part where I had to hold on to a one of the little uh spinning wheels and it wasn't spinning yet so while I was holding it with the uh r trigger um or whatever it's called the r button um I had to use my uh left hand to actually spin the wheel around so he would go up to the top I was like that's awesome you know this is cool well I would expect talking about the design of the system again in your hands and the way that whole works uh kaijuto is in our chat room at chat.orangelandreay.com saying this guy must have fred flinstone thumbs do you just have abnormal hands no no these are really small like I my hands are not big at all and these I swear were like the size of mini m&ms something people might know okay there you go that's a good comparison okay so what else little big planet and okay after that they sent us over to virtual tennis which um so far these two games I was told are launch titles for the system um so virtual tennis really nice looking um they had you play it first with the just touch screen so you would press the spot on the court to move your guy you hold your finger down your guy would move and then you could flick up to do a top spin and then flick down to do a back spin and it actually and it actually worked really well um then I was introduced to control how is that touch screen stuff different from like playing an iphone game or is that really what it felt like like oh I'm playing an iphone that's really what it felt like with nice graphics okay and it was on a bigger screen okay and um yeah so then uh he told me to do all my um hits uh with the touch screen and I could move with the analog stick like okay this actually I kind of like the way that one played um and then it's like oh just play normally and you know I could play normally it wasn't like super impressive but it was still really fun because virtual tennis games are pretty fun so after my time was up there um I went to the what's that super game called little deviants that game is pretty much what I feel like they're trying to one-up nintendo with um it seems to be a collection of mini games for the most part um there were three that we got to play the first one was an ar game just like face rater to a t like with the exception of putting somebody's face in it uh you just look around with your screen all over all over the actual environment for these little spaceships you had to destroy before they destroyed your little deviant characters um the next one was a whack-a-mole style game that used both the touch screen and the touch pad on the back so windows would open up and if they were facing you you had to touch the touch screen on them um and if they were back turned to you you had to press from behind underneath um and watch out for the humans because you lost points for that these all definitely sound like little like gimmicky demos that to be fair is probably the same stuff the same stuff they're demoing the wii u with right now so exactly um the last one was uh this uh it's the one that probably everybody's seen where you have the touch pad on the back and you make the hills and you roll the ball the bvm ball guy around into the whirlpool that one was probably what really frustrated me most with the the touch pad on the back just because i mean it feels inevitable that you will rest your fingers on the back of the pads the way they don't want you to do it um and there was no clear definition on the back where the touchpad started where it ended so that one was really hard for me so little deviance though it sounds like it's just a mini game collection i don't know to me it kind of sounds like a pass i've seen it before what did you think uh i'm it's not a not a purchase for me at all um it was like bundled in with the system i'm not gonna delete it but i'm not gonna purchase it okay all right um the next one i went to uh was sound what did i call it sound something or other sound sound something was it a music game um yes it kind of was um man now i feel bad because i was talking about how much i love that game sound shapes i'm looking at your text from earlier sound shapes yes so thank you sound shapes which is interesting because this was not even something that we saw at the press conference so when you texted me that i'm like what the hell is that that must be like a game they didn't say anything about otherwise it's been talked about before i know that um it's made by the guy that did i want to say like either pixel junk or everyday shooter i don't remember it's one of those two um but in it it's got two modes it's got a platforming mode which is very simplistic shapes um you're just like little blue spiky ball looking thing but the object is to get through the level and to hit these blue orbs and every time you hit a blue orb in that screen it creates like the drums for the music or it creates the guitar or the keyboard so you keep going looking at the audio you guys are hearing in the background i'm looking at a video of this because i want to see more about what he's talking about here oh the guy's talking through it yeah we can't have two people talking i'll i'll just look at the video then but uh yeah so you go through uh different screens trying to collect all the blue orbs to create the music it was very much a music-y platformer that caught my attention right away um i was told again launch title and that people would be able to create their own stages and upload them for other people to play oh cool that's really cool and that's the other part of the um demo it was he was showing me how to create my own stage and placing music at certain points and placing the orbs and traps and it was really cool i liked it a lot interesting as a music game fan uh this is kind of a must-have for you because i'm looking at this going this does not look at all like other music games but i'm i'm glad because i think it's you know i don't always need to see falling notes that you hit whatever device too you know so this is kind of nice yeah i i think it's it's not only a game for music fans but also for um possibly platforming fans because people who like to get high and play video games what was that people who like to get high and play video games no because they'll probably like try to eat their psv or drop it thinking it's some crazy monster okay we need we need we need new crack since moja ribbons already out that's kind of like it's simplistic like that like like the brib and stuff so i think it was great um definitely gonna be the first game i buy because it was the one that impressed me the most which makes me sad because the next demo playing too was uncharted and that was the game that at first announcement had pulled me on the vita before it was called that and before i played it um and it didn't disappoint me per se uh i think it looked beautiful and played like uncharted my problem with it is those tiny little m&m buttons that um like they just got in my way i couldn't perform moves as well uh i definitely got shot and killed twice during our demo because i couldn't get the button properly um that wasn't any of the top screen controls of what was that did you try any of the touch screen controls stealth takedowns jumping stuff like that see that that's what i'm about to i was about to say is that like i like the what they called painting where you move your finger across like ledges and he would move there that was cool but once you used it for hand-to-hand combat i hated it i absolutely thought it was stupid because i have to instead of like you know position myself with the camera and my body for the next enemy after i'm done punching this guy to death it takes one hand off of that and i have to focus on tapping the little fist icon which was stupid i thought you would like that because when i was seeing that in the trailer i was like that looks like elite beat agents and that's like belita's favorite game no no it's nothing like that at all it was frustrating and kind of annoying but um i'm sure that that will not be the only way to play um i don't even could probably use the little m&m buttons to hit too but uh the demo i didn't get a chance to try that because like oh use the touch screen only for combat it's like okay thanks for getting me killed but um yeah that ended the ps vita experience so it was worth the four hour wait yes i think so because i think i have waited in long lines at e3 to four and not come away as satisfied as i did with the vita okay all right so now what's interesting though is that you even though you enjoyed the vita and you're like okay i definitely want this sound shapes game and there's a couple other things i played that i want i really need them to fix some of these design issues even though there might not be any time now yeah i i don't think the little buttons will hold me back from purchasing one because i think a lot of that has to do with my hands being more accustomed to holding like a psp so it like my my fingers gravitate to where um i think it's going to be at because i mean let's be honest it looks just like a psp it's a little bit like longer um a little bit wider and a lot lighter actually it's like nothing in your hands whatsoever um let me ask this question real quick because you know you said that you definitely want to get the ps vita and i walked away from the sony press conference saying i'm not really sure i understand why i need a vita still and and my whole thing was that okay it just looks like it's a uh you know psp with a back touch thing a front touch thing and slightly more power so what once it's slightly more power a lot more power a lot more but we'll see i think the psp as it is still holds up and looks really really good there's a lot of really good looking games on there so the psv is even better yes interesting i guess maybe the screenshots online is such just don't do it justice so i'm looking forward it doesn't like when you see the screen in person that that's what got my attention first and then the weight in my hands got it second and then it's just a really nicely designed system for once now i kind of asked bobby about this yesterday because he waited in line for the wii u uh most of the day you waited in line for the ps vita most of the day did you catch any kind of like buzz from people around you now see the funny thing was bobby was standing around a bunch of people who didn't speak english yesterday so there was like no one for him to listen to but did you did you kind of catch what was the buzz what were other people saying about the vita were people complaining about the controller like you were or i didn't hear any complaints about the vita except for the long wait time like i had people behind me leave a couple times because they were tired of waiting clearly this must have been their first c3 because you know you have to wait forever for stuff yes um i didn't hear any buzz about vita i did over here i'm not sure if this is considered i'm sure it probably has but i heard something about skyrim randomly um from a dev saying that the uh it was a bethesda dev so it wasn't like some random person but they were talking to um one of the naughty dog people that were over there and they said that um skyrim is going to have about 30 hours of main quest and 300 hours of side quest nice uh i know bobby got some i i don't know if he got no he didn't get hands-on he got like a 30-minute demo with skyrim today so he was he got a little special bethesda show so uh we'll talk to him more about the details there later i do like over maybe i'm just nosy but i like one of my favorite things at e3 is to just like over here people because people do talk about rather loudly so i can hear them about um interesting stuff kind of like what you're just saying yeah so all right so the ps vita took up most of your day but you were you were happy with it at the end of the day what else were you able to get your hands on today um i got to play child of eden um which was definitely not totally what i was expecting but i still really liked it um the control scheme's a little weird and it was a guy the guy that was explained to me a wasn't from ubisoft b was from walmart and c you look at b again and realize the amount of knowledge you probably had about the game um he didn't really tell me how to play properly i don't think so it was hard to just jump in randomly and start playing but it felt a lot like rez it looked like rez it sounded like rez um but the two firing mechanisms are different like your left hand is like a rapid fire gun that only works on like these pinkish um enemies and your right hand is your lock on gun gun and i couldn't tell if i was supposed to like lock on fully and then like swing my hands forward to shoot or if it was just automatically shot i think i had to point my hand forward but i definitely was getting hit a whole lot in that game but it was on no die so it didn't matter and the music was really good i imagine uh what little i could hear yeah because if this one was outside underneath the tent oh lord which is of course the optimal playing uh you know environment for a music game and a connect game they must have been at that booth where i think rock of the dead was shown last year and it was not a great location there's amongst all you know you want what that booth was that booth was where a long time ago i think you were there for the c3 where they have the balls tent set up i don't even think i remember that but that's all right it's been a long time that's like not even on convention grounds it's across the street oh geez oh oh god okay you were like you weren't even in the convention center at that point yeah that's when i was walking there this morning and then they're like hey do you want to come play some games we got brinks i was like no no i can't try out the theater it's like yep let's go over there because i i still haven't found it on the show floor and i've been looking it's probably not there because it's out like what next week so i don't think there's a lot more to say about it so all right well what else did you use hands on um i didn't get my hands on it but i did get to sit through the presentation for saint throw the third um and that was pretty funny i've never liked open world games and i don't like gta or anything like that so i just kind of went in with an open mind and that game looks freaking hilarious and they didn't censor the the dildo bat thing that they hit people with that was really funny and they also said that you can make your character naked in play i was like how is this going to get an m rating at that point unless they're like built like a barbie doll naked naked to them might mean like booty shorts you know it might be like just nothing but you know well so my male character i'd make would have beauty shorts i guess that's your i i don't know if you just heard damn but la noir i don't know if you play that that got an m rating and that's got full-on beaver so totally oh yeah i don't know i haven't i i've got it i haven't finished it yet or even some clothes spoiler well i guess yeah i guess if it's not like an actual fashion it won't get anything bad but um that was really funny uh i liked what i saw they showed up off some open world stuff which was just humorous and then um like you can put people in a cannon that's on a car and shoot them out and everybody loves you because uh you're you're getting the things are like like celebrities so no matter what you do they like you so you put them in a cannon you shoot them out at things and you know they die and people are all excited because they're meeting you um this is gonna be a totally obscure reference but this reminds me of um one of the movies that stars divine if you uh know who divine is i think it's female trouble or something and you know it's always she's very filthy and over the top and stuff and there's a scene where she's like who wants to die for art and everybody's like me me me and so she shoots one of them and i don't know why but what you're describing sounds to me like that but that's the over the top craziness is what they're going for in this game so they've succeeded yeah definitely um and then they showed a mission which they were uh robbing a bank and it turned out to be like you know some rival gangs bank or whatever so fighting ensued and at one point during the gunfight which was really gory too um just some random person in the hood he came up and asked for your autograph and you get like extra points if you sign it i was like that's hilarious awesome um so is this even though you don't play the gta style games it sounds like you might be interested in getting this one yeah i might try this one this one looks really funny so i mean that's one thing about grandpa does it takes itself pretty seriously and i don't know this just seems like like kind of like smoking aces that would be or was it lucky number seven i don't know no that's broken aces yeah i'm not looking over seven um but that's really all i got to play today i think like i'm racking my my brain but the vita took up so much time that i don't think there was much else for today all right so uh uh anything you're gonna try to look at tomorrow i mean i know we're not doing a show tomorrow but anything you might want to look at i was debating on doing the wee or not and i think my final decision is i'm not gonna go to it because i don't think it's worth the time um so i think tomorrow is going to be catch up day like i'm gonna go try to do uncharted 3 because you get like a t-shirt and some stuff for doing uncharted 3 i'm gonna go back through the 3ds lines because you get pins um when you play the games and i want more pins because it's swag and i and risen heaven is there for the we and i haven't got to play it yet and i really want to do that because i like rhythm heaven so i might just hang out in the we and sony tomorrow and just completely avoid the other hall because i mean most of the cool stuff is either behind closed doors or just in video form so you're kind of finding the uh usual e3 thing that seems to be more and more popular the last five years to be true where all the really good stuff is behind closed doors and there's very little out there on the on the floor for the rest of you yeah yeah that's too bad i don't understand the the media restrictions this year because it doesn't look like it really changed anything i felt like if they did the restrictions it would probably mean like more stuff on the floor but it feels like there's less stuff on the floor like 2k and Activision all have their stuff behind closed doors i think Bethesda has all their stuff behind closed doors ea has all all their good stuff behind closed doors huh wow i guess they just don't want the general public forming opinions on games like we're doing right now so so and well cannot be needs to take that advice and you know hide like silent hill when they want because it's awful i tried it again today that's right and it was still bad so that whole day did not make a difference how funny i was just asked it's because dark soccer is very sad to hear that silent hill isn't very good i'm sad to hear it too but uh you need to try the alan wait game that's supposedly xbox where is that i would have or else i haven't seen it uh i think it's a microsoft boost somewhere unless it's uh behind closed doors like everything else i don't know oh let me just have to hear that hall again ask bobby he's in chat oh wait you're not in chat i was just asked bob bobby's in the chat room he might be able to tell you well maybe you can relay the message to me right now since we're live and you can read a chat room you will just have to do some research all right all right well uh me glitov thank you very much for uh joining us past couple days and giving us your thoughts and impressions on what you saw on the show floor anything else you want to get out before we let you go no i ran to kira yeah kiriyama okra twice today why are you stalking him yeah i did another time i did not text you about because i was like at that point is it really worth it like it's like a daily occurrence now are you asking for his picture every time are you are you making eye contact with him and giving him flirty eyebrows did you give him a hug he loves i've already given i've already given him like a side hug before no full-on manly pat on the back hug go for it and close your eyes you don't know what to do because christian side is really bad he what i missed that last part what did you say i said you only give christian side hugs yeah okay that's probably true oh i said uh every time i've gone up to him i keep you know realizing how bad his english is and he had like a translator chick with him today so it kind of helped but yeah it's kind of hard to talk to him and i don't think that me running up and trying to give him a hug would help you know break down that language barrier or anything fail yeah see you know saying dice he really long elongated because he would be running away why you no hug speaking broken english that's like i was thinking of the the little men main thing the so-and-so why you know this all right mijot we're gonna let you go uh i gotta get bobby on it's uh here too tiger call said he'd be like security exactly you don't want to get thrown out of the last time someone's not even near the convention center so he has no security to call if you are gonna get thrown out of e3 though if you are gonna get thrown out of e3 though do it on the last day yes all right so what like try to make out with them if you want i know that's your call all right i'm not endorsing it all right bye thank you again for joining us and have fun tonight at whatever parties you're going to are you going to any parties tonight what are you doing tonight uh i'm supposedly going to an old konami employee meetup and that's not really a party more uh let's complain about our lives tell them we miss them because konami games were good like five years ago all right oh yeah all right take care all right goodbye bye all right miklotov ladies and gentlemen joining us here live on orange lounge radio our second and final day of e3 coverage what do you guys think about what

about five and so there were heinekens no there were there were new castles and that's when i met new castles why did i say heineken yeah new castle is the best ever how was it how was the Bethesda party did you ride the bull no i didn't ride the bull i mainly felt like it was so packed like everybody was there but i mean it was so packed like i tried to go out and mingle and it was just like i'm going back to my table with electric sisterhood and i'm just gonna sit here and when they did karaoke we changed the lyrics to every single song to friday because that's for the journey song that was the only one we didn't turn into friday but everything else somehow became talking about friday and front seats and back seats and you know which which one do i take because that's what's funny when you're drinking a bunch of Bethesda beer that's right beer thesda and we look if we look it was not a karaoke song or i would have sung it did ninja sister get on the bull no no no they didn't somebody one of the people from their crew did and he sang as well ah okay but uh neither of the sisters did all right all right well anyhow let's let's talk about your day at e3 today you got to actually get a little more of the games today because yesterday obviously your day was like all we you well not all but mostly right today you got to get a little more into some of the other games so what tell us about some of the stuff you got hands on with today i know i know skyrim was a big demo you got right you didn't you didn't get hands on but yeah right yeah it's a it was a demo and and some of the things i mean it it looks really nice um it crashed on us which is great um it crashed they're like hmm we need to do we need to switch something out until like the skyrim logo came up and he like did some stuff and flashed some things and then you know okay now we're continuing again out of curiosity did they tell you to shut off your video cameras did they tell you to shut off your video cameras in that demo oh yeah yeah no no photos no video cameras um that one you could record audio like i could have recorded him speaking uh but yeah no video cameras or anything in defense of anything you know and um but it was sorry to answer something that came up when miklotov was on the show earlier that's why a lot of stuff is behind closed doors so they can take away cameras and things like that and not let you use them because of what just happened when when bobby was seeing skyrim is that when the game crashes then they don't want people running to youtube going look at this piece of shit game and how it crashes well i was gonna say though you remember when we got into bethesda um when we got the appointment with bethesda the first year and they just like go ahead and film star trek that's cool i think a star trek was was coming out soon i was filming call of cthulhu too all right they're just like please please film anything just just get it out there no now with the rise of camera phones yeah leaks are you know they're instant you know you're oh recorded oh it's on youtube and they just don't want to take that chance i understand sorry for the tangent bob and they were watching they were watching for people if they happen to be holding up a phone or something and they had tried to be discreet so now here was one thing is um you know a lot of people i heard a lot of people bitch about another rpg that came out a couple years ago uh that i played the sequel to today final fantasy 13 and why am i bringing that up in reference to siren because that whole chrysanthemum whatever it's called that's your skill system in skyrim interesting huh the way that you uh basically you unlock these constellations in the sky and that's how you choose your skills and inside that there's a little ring where you get as you get more skill points you go to the next point of the ring and it creates a little circle and stuff like that that i mean it does like i looked at it i'm like that's final fantasy 13 right there wow and like people hated it in final fantasy 13 but they're probably gonna love it in skyrim of course of course double standards drive the gaming media what are you talking about yeah see i got it because i didn't bring this up last night the public is an idiot i think um because i i have heard so much like snark and hate and stuff from the gaming community about like everything like it's like you know sitting in the chat room during the press conferences like you think that you know microsoft took a big old dump in the middle of the stage and gave you smell-o-vision so you could smell it at home because like they just hated everything they're like why don't all this stuff that connect oh modern warfare 3 i don't want to see modern warfare 3 oh oh it's another halo oh wah wah and you know and then like nintendo like hey this is like something you've never seen before i don't want that they don't want another mario you'll suck you know and it's like i mean there's a lot of people out there like dude if you don't you know i gaming may have moved on past you and you may need to just stop gaming if there's nothing that has been shown that you like you're a little bit too jaded to be a gamer i think and i've been seeing that a lot it's not here at the show floor like there's not that much hate here it's all the people at home i like that in the absence of loki tonight we get bobby doing the ranting that is not what i expect i thought it would be damn but we get bobby doing the ranting bobby's ranting seems to come off a little bit more cerebral i'm trying to let bobby rant because he sounds like he has some things he needs to work out i think he knows what i think he's right on oh exactly all i can say is agree like times 10 likes this post people yeah exactly like people are idiots they just can't handle it it reggie hit it on the head you know and it's funny that he walked out in public and he just said it he's like look you guys want things that are different but you want something you're comfortable with fine we'll fucking do that we're nintendo it's what we do sony's just like whatever here's a better psp and uncharted microsoft's like connect and everybody's just like oh my god why can't there be something mind-blowing it's because the people are spoiled they got used to these blockbuster e3 announcements every year and now the blockbusters aren't good enough because the gaming companies got practically nothing left or they're just not willing to show it off yet do you think the microsoft thing might have come off a lot different if it hadn't been spoiled literally 30 minutes before showtime yes halo 4 i think so too much much more important had everybody not i think gamer underpants everywhere would have needed to be changed if that had not been honestly they should have led with halo 4 you think exactly all right anyway i don't want to recap the press conferences i gotta i gotta move forward here but um bobby skyrim was it as beautiful as it seems to look when i'm watching it on game trailers or wherever online yes and now i mean they probably souped it up a little bit it was running on a big movie screen uh but it looked and sounded beautiful um you know and then you have all the weather effects and changing the weather effects and stuff like that does does it look like and then right go ahead yeah uh go ahead go ahead now i was gonna say does it seem like you'll sink as many hours into skyrim as you did with oblivion because oblivion you could easily sink triple digit hours into that game it was disgusting yes absolutely because they even showed like these they walked us through a town and like here's all the stuff you can do in the town and you could just go over here and chop wood you can do jobs like a table and you know all that stuff so there's you know lots of other side quests a lot other than the main story that they're packing in here and you know the the dragons are awesome just you know watching you know how they fly around and it's quick and you know all the stuff they're doing and and it's not like a you know pattern boss fight is what they they said they said they've got ai so no two dragon fights will be the same and even like our guy got you know hit around a couple times probably didn't expect so i mean they showed a couple different like two dragon player they showed dragon five we ran away from and then we met up with that dragon again and then a bigger dragon showed up and it was just you know here let me show you how you can do these spells and you know i do this and i can shout this at him and i'll use this fireball on him and you know injure him so he hits the ground and you know runs up to a castle to see if other people will help him and the dragon goes up and eats those people it was awesome do you think it'll make the release date of 11 11 11 uh i believe they will it was i mean it was you know they showed us all the menu systems and so all that stuff's coded in and i think that they're in the polishing phase right now other than that one bug that crashed the thing but um you know i i think they will i think they'll make that and um i i think people will be pleased with it now i mean the fez obviously does have the track record of releasing buggy games and uh games crash and stuff so i i would not be surprised if that's the case here um but you know they've done that and uh you know like all the stuff they've done with the menu system and the map system and kind of makes things more exciting and seamless and stuff and you know they simplified the combat your the right triggers your right hand your left trigger your left hand whatever's in it that's what goes so you know there's your shield and you know your sword and stuff like that do the monsters still level do the monsters still level up with you they did not talk about that interesting but i i would assume that they would because they're Bethesda and they're evil like that all right well so uh was that the only thing that Bethesda showed you or did you get to see anything else i went to see their prey to demonstration okay and and uh you know where you know it's alien noir is what they were calling it and stuff and and you know running around um basically in this game you play as the u.s marshal on a plane that crashed in the first game that you actually saw in the first game so he you know you start off there and then you actually it fast forwards six months later to when you're like the only human on their alien planet and you're now doing jobs oh i didn't realize that's how they were tying it together because when you see that trailer you're like what the hell does this have to do with prey yeah that was my literal reaction this looks awesome and i showed it to alan who loves that like cloverfield and and blair witch kind of stuff that's all and that's very much what the trailer is like right and it was like wow this is awesome it's it's it's prey yeah yeah so i mean basically and you do meet up with the character they did say spoiler alert you do meet up with the character from prey one eventually interesting story but basically you're you are uh a mercenary for hire because you used to be a u.s marshal so that's why you had a gun on the plane when it crashed into whatever in prey one uh so he basically took those skills and now he's a mercenary a human mercenary on this on the home world of the alien and he's actually takes jobs for the aliens he can go through and help people or hurt people and he can corral people in and there's you know thugs will attack you as you go through it's a big open world thing on their alien planet so that that was kind of interesting and and uh you know i watched that until that crashed oh because he was like i need to go up to this guy and there's a climbing thing and so he starts climbing up and his arm starts going through the wall and then it just freezes so it sounds like uh that that would go ahead and then so that that was like and i'm like you know i've seen this it's cool i'm sold i'm gonna go check out something else because you know that was 15 minutes into the demo and i didn't know how long it would take them to get the demo back up and if they'd be in the same spot so that's all i saw pretty too and then i uh since i don't like shooters i still went over to rage and the racing so i could see how that was and it's very smooth and very fluid and i did the little three-lap race and stuff um but it's it's a very those enemies are a little cheap because it's i couldn't figure out how to defend myself against the missiles that they kept throwing at me so i anytime i would get into third out of four anytime i got into third place i would immediately like blow up and there's nothing i could do about it like incoming i'm like okay what do i do okay i'll go around this corner oh it's a homing missile damn i'm blown up again at least you gave it the good old college try i did so um so yeah so i got to that's what i did in the Bethesda booth um and uh so i'm trying to think of what else i uh looked at and played today i mean i i went in and my other appointment was with ccp games and it was it was a powerpoint presentation uh with some videos embedded in about how they're going to be working dust 5.4 into eve online and essentially they were talking about their vision and the technology and it is it's really neat and i've learned the reason they're ps3 exclusive is because sony has relaxed a lot of their rules on what they can and can't do on psn and microsoft wouldn't do that dust 514 is a multiplayer only first-person shooter and it is running on the exact same servers of eve online as in you're going to be in the same corporation as eve online players you can transfer money and items between eve online and dust 514 basically dust 514 is the only way you can be on a planet and eve online is the only way you can be in space wow and so and so corporations that already have wars going on now will have the added dimension of the wars in dust 514 and they will be fighting on the planet and yes i because i as you see this in the trailer and they're like yes this is exactly how it works the people playing dust 514 can call up to the people playing eve online and orbit around the planet say i need an orbital strike i need a you know laser strike and the people playing eve can then call down this big massive laser that's in orbit to incinerate something in the dust 514 multiplayer match going on at that same time that sounds awesome i've never played eve online in my life it's just not something that's really jumped out as something interesting to me but that sounds amazing like i i i love how the two different games tie together like that that sounds just awesome and dust 514 is tailored for first-person shooter fans who felt eve was too complex or out of their league a little bit you know they couldn't get into it but they still like the idea of being a part of this universe uh single shard server they said that they've had i think 64 000 people concurrent is their record of how many people have played eve online at one time on one for her wow and and uh and also uh dust 514 it's going to be like a it's going to be a psn title downloadable uh 20 or 30 bucks i don't they didn't really pay the price it's somewhere around there so it's a downloadable title and then it's free to play there's no monthly fee oh wow and that money and the coverage they call it a cover charge is what they call buying the title and that money that you pay for that gets turned into in-game currency so you start off with money already in your account which is basically the market value of what you just pay for that cover charge isn't that kind of how eve online works too i i i think you can buy like they support uh real money trade because they they they endorse it or they they do they monitor it they they provide it yeah well yeah well it's there's a monthly subscription for eve online but if you're good enough you can actually buy they're called plex pilot license extension cards in the game that gives you 30 more days oh right okay okay that's how and you can you know trade them in game and stuff like people and that's how you know some corporations will actually pay people to play the game for them by giving them plex wow and you you can do that so you know yeah so it's an amazing economy and they were even talking about you know some of the wars and stuff that have gone on and they even like actually referenced one of these player corporations in their trailer video where it was um i can't remember it might have been like the netherlands or something was where this corporation was from and they were fighting a russian corporation corporation in this one sector of space and you know the russians were out out out powering them and out maneuvering them and in stuff but the the the dutch kept coming back and they couldn't figure out why and so there was espionage in the game by these corporations ccp had nothing to do with this espionage in the game where they kind of figured out that the americans were funding the dutch because they didn't want to fight the russians directly so they cut off they cut off the trade route wiped out that dutch corporation and that was the end of it wow so it's stuff like that that they're you know because they say you know games like world of warcraft and everquest those are theme parks where there are quests given to you and you know it's the same thing every time and stuff like that eve online it's the sandbox they give you the fan the bucket you know the the area and you make the story and that's what they're saying that you know dust 514 is going to do with the same type of thing where you know and and the reason it's geographically like that is because of like time zones and stuff that's when people are playing and so they expect that that's going to be the same way and they did say that uh for latency if you're worried about lags it's the first person shooter eve online is not you know it can handle latency uh the first person shooter they're actually going to have battle servers in various parts of the world so you'll be connecting to that instead because their main eve online server cluster is in london so currently when you play eve online their supercomputer is in london and it's like they said like it weighs more than a ton but i think they said how many machines it was uh but they didn't i can't remember the number but they're going to have battle servers in uh geographic locations so you have a low ping you know when you're playing dust 514 because this most console games are peer-to-peer where one of the other ps3s is the server right in this the server is eve online and sony was the only one that allowed them to do that interesting and they also said that uh i asked you know you're you're infuriating a lot of pc players and stuff and they're like eve online's been around for over eight years you can read between the lines on that wow i feel like i've learned more about this game than anything else at e3 and like i i kind of just went no okay and it might tie into eve online that might be kind of cool but the way you describe it i'm like wow this this this almost makes me want to try eve online at least it sounds interesting yeah it sounds really interesting if they pull it off that's that's fast that's fascinating how the one game could impact the other like that so cool kai judo asks uh when can i get my hands on some stuff they are doing a very closed beta at the end of the year which is going to be closed in the sense of it's going to go to the high end eve online players and you know hand-picked people but sometime next year uh but they've been laying the groundwork for dust inside e for the last three years with their expansion uh like you know planetary building planetary formations and stuff like that you could build refineries on planet that started two years ago that was in preparation for dust and that in introduced some of the server aspects that would handle dust and you know stuff like that so it was i mean it was the reason i'm talking so much about it because they gave so much interesting technical information for me as a technical person as well um that you know it's just they didn't show the game like they didn't play the game they did with the powerpoint they showed some movies it wasn't even real like some of it was real gameplay footage but you know they didn't actually have a playable where they had a playable in other places before um you know they've just said you know we're talking about our philosophy and creating games and here's what we're trying to do and here's what we've already done and you know we're awesome and that's okay you got so much information about it that you're still a little hype for the game i mean at the end of the day it'll really be about well how does it you know how does it pull off because although it sounds awesome in theory like what if this breaks eve online you know like but these you know again like you said eve online has been around for eight years you know it may not be a quote-unquote competitor to wow but it's always been a great like alternative to wow but i just like i think of a game like star trek online which i played just a little bit during the beta but jamie you were really into and the thing with star trek online for me is that i loved the away team stuff but i did not like the space combat at all but like what if that was two separate games and like i could just play a game that's nothing but away team stuff i would have been all over that see it actually kind of got turned around for me that i liked the space see you could play eve i could play dust and we could still kind of be in that same universe that's always something i'd kind of wanted you know that you had your position i mean yeah it's a little different with star trek but i think that i get the thing it would be really cool wow so interesting fascinating you don't get off the ship you're stuck there the most fascinating part of my day wow all right well i i don't know if you can follow that up with other impressions and other things you saw that maybe fascinated you a little bit okay well no i can and actually i got an interview with this guy because you know i was kind of walking around and i passed by nico's booth you know they make all those you know the the extra peripherals or whatever and i'm like usually i'm like eh it's nico all right this time i actually stopped and looked and what they've got is a device that might improve a lot for a lot of people motion gaming it's called the zoom and what this does it's for the connect and it basically because connect fires out all these infrared lasers and that's how it determines the positioning it actually modifies where the lasers go and it gives it a wide angle lens so now you don't have to stand as far away from your tv nice so it basically instead of being six to eight feet away you can now be four to six feet away and two players of connect adventures can be you know stand kind of where one player would stand before and it seemed it worked pretty well from what i was seeing on there so i have a little i have an interview with a guy talking about that and uh you know how much it's going to cost which it's not that expensive it's only 30 bucks and it's coming out in august that could be great for those of us that live in like apartments and things where we're a little more cramped up or just if you have a lot of stuff like some people do that sounds great or not not want to have to move the coffee table every time you want to play connect i think that's that sounds like it could be an awesome peripheral you know if it works but it it seems like if you were watching people play it at e3 that were they're normal people playing it right not not all their people right it's you could have i could have walked up and played it nice you just didn't want anyone to get that on video yeah so uh but um let's see what else did i um i did play uh final fantasy 13 too how was that and i don't know if i don't know if shane talked about that or not uh it is uh uh it is uh final fantasy 13 plus shamu because of the with the quick time events and stuff um and and it built some uh other neat camera things and it is going to be a little bit more open uh no open-ended and stuff you can you know because like final fantasy 13 it gave me that sense of urgency of the linearity of it and stuff and then when you get more as urgent then you could roam around well that sense of urgency is probably not going to be there as much in 13 too you know i let you know go ahead yeah i was just saying i looked at the trailer for 13 too online and uh i did notice it seemed like they were emphasizing even in the trailer that there was more open world and open environments you could see in the maps they were not linear so i mean that was one of the biggest you know complaints about 13 so i i could that was one thing i noticed right off the top yep and uh one of the things that happened to me is that a monster joined my party so i had i had a monster in my party i had my two humans and then like this monster suddenly was in my party i don't know why it was you know i couldn't hear anything so i didn't know if it was explaining dialogue but uh you know so and it depending on what paradigm you were in that monster change like he was a little fire plant in commando mode or when you turn him to ravager he turned into this big server thing huh so it was it was that was kind of cool and they introduced this um and i didn't really understand it all that much once again because i was on the show floor uh but it's like you've got a little mod with you and when enemies appear a little countdown timer appears and however quick you hit the enemy uh that you know that determines if you get this first hit or if they hit you first or whatever uh that was kind of interesting and then they did some of like these cinematic events and live events and stuff uh while you're just walking around and you know you can still walk around and like the camera will change to show something happening hmm so it was kind of cool um you know i'm you know i'm sold on it but you also like 13 right what you also like 13 and a lot of you also like 13 though right and a lot of people didn't yes i like 13 so you know you keep that in mind when i say that that i you know since i like 13 you know i like 32 i like what they added to it but it is you know the core gameplay of the paradigm shifting all that stuff that's that's still there 13 it didn't change at least not what i saw um do you think that maybe there's enough there to kind of squelch the haters a little bit oh no haters are gonna hate all right sounds familiar gamershateeverything.com right that's right okay exactly um so let's see i'm trying to think of what else i kind of walked by and got to see it was i was running around and stuff um i did go into atlas's booth a little bit in the little meeting room area that was open so i could get into it um and they were showing uh rock of ages which is the only one rock of ages and they were showing catherine and they were talking about other things but those were kind of the only ones they were showing um and i played rock of ages and i'm it was it's kind of hard the thing about e3 that people don't realize is that a lot of times they dump you in the middle of things and there's not always a tutorial and there's not always a guy standing there telling you okay here's what's going on so i had no clue what i was doing it's like it's a tower defense game and then it's katamari damasi but not really because it's not tank controls and you're trying to break down another guy's castle and it was it was kind of interesting i'm sure that i'd like it more if i played it you know knowing what i was doing but um that one was kind of cool i didn't you know there was too many people for catherine in the place was getting cramped so i didn't get to go in there um so uh trying to think of what else did you do you remember seeing anything on my twitter that i've been missing no i i mostly wanted to hear about skyrim though but that you were getting some feedback on twitter today any good uh any good questions you were able to get answered for people on twitter at twitter.com slash bobby blackwolf i i did i started answering questions and then loki actually answered them better than i did because like they weren't they weren't giving me exact dates and he'd be like oh no that's coming out on february 12th um one thing i didn't get to play this yet um but uh you know a good colleague of mine shadow next gen he's actually sitting right across from me right now howdy um he he was uh able to get in to see the demo of fable the journey oh we learned something but not many people are talking about what's that the game is not on rails oh it sure looked like it was on rails okay okay it sure looked like it but according to mr molyneux who apparently gave that particular demo just because he had nothing else better to do he said it's not on rails and you know you can believe everything that molyneux says yeah it's always dead on accurate not not over hyped at all so okay well then maybe maybe we'll just need to see more videos of the game in actual well i wonder how do you move around yet you have the connect thing going on that's why i always assumed a lot of connect stuff was on rails because like well if i'm not holding a controller but i i also kind of thought connect was supposed to allow me to sit my big butt on the couch with my controller yeah and maybe i'll maybe i'll lift my hand and wave it for something you know or or at some point it could actually see fingers i don't know yeah now the game i did play today and this is the reason i forgot about this because it was the first one i did this morning i went to disneyland already i've already been to disney you went to play disneyland adventures huh i did i played connect adventures with disney characters and that one the way the way that you move in that and it's kind of interesting funny like in the overworld the the disneyland area they actually have like the quest markers that look just like tabled like the little yellow circles around things um but the way you move on that is you just put your hand down and you start moving and then if you go right and left that's how you turn your character um and i did an alice in wonderland video or mini game and uh it was um you remember the whitewater raft rafting thing that was in connect adventures yes yeah it's that it's that with alice in wonderland characters um so it basically you know when you guys are saying it's connect adventure with disney that's pretty much what it is also i guess to me like i didn't get to do the the peter pan one but it's been a while since i've been there but it's not a one-to-one representation of the ride at least i hope the alice in wonderland ride is not you in a golf in a golf ball with alice hitting you and sending you down and all these cards are trying to you know get in your way and you have to jump over them i can guarantee you the ride is not like bobbie you will not have to worry if we do end up going on that ride on friday we will not get pelt golf balls at you unless you want that full experience because we are going for research purposes that's only on it's a small world at least that's what you feel like by the time you get out of it when a small world breaks down the puppets start pelting oh i've been in there when it during christmas all those people are actually people who are trapped inside of the ride when it broke down and they were turned into little mannequins and then you sing forever so was it was it enough to make you go gosh i i might actually kind of want to get this game or were you like nah this is just the same crap with a new label i i said gosh i might want to put this game on my gamefly queue okay kind of in the middle all right get it from gamefly get my achievements then get out right yeah fair enough yeah um so other than that i'm really i mean i talked to the playstation home developers a little bit oh uh and i'm probably going to be doing an interview with them because blender uh asked me about you know because there's this big freezing bug and they you know you i was talking to people that actually work on i think content creation stuff but they were like yeah we addressed that finally like this you know yesterday and you know blah blah blah and they have like things that they want people to do if they encounter like we want this far wide i'm like so you want to go on the air about that and they're like oh i'd love to but i got to talk to pr so i may have this huge ps home interview tomorrow i'm soliciting questions on twitter tonight some people have sent me some real good ones wow but i may be able to report an interview there i know there's a lot of questions people have about playstation home like when's it getting out of beta is it a google product yeah so um i think it's all data didn't they take the word beta out of home no no when i launched it earlier today or not uh last night you know how i went into playstation home it was completely on accident i met to go i meant to go in the store and i accidentally like because my thumbs are fat like fred flintstone i went up and i went into playstation home instead and i was like well shit now that i launched this i might as well just kind of look around i clearly noticed the beta tag still on it and i was like hasn't this been around for like two years now at least so uh and then uh i did kind of walk through the indicate booth which is all the independent games where they had nerd twister as an actual twister with a voice telling you where to put your next hand or foot on what color but the way that they did it it's it's the i think they call it twister anapolis 5000 it's a race so everybody starts at the end and i posted a picture of this on twitter and it says real long twister board and everybody starts one end of the twister board and it says okay right hand blue and so you put your right hand on blue and you know and you're trying to go forward and whoever makes it to the end first without leaving one of their you know without waving one of your other hands uh they declared the winner so that that was interesting and they had something else like what they had like it looked like a four square court but i couldn't like they were throwing cups or something i don't know what that was but i also saw in there i was just saying because the twister but the twister was nerd twister what happened is that when you got to the very end the mat was pulled away and you all fall into a cologne bath and that's how they kept e3 sane now that was not the craziest thing that i saw in the indicator oh dear okay and i was i wanted to get a picture of this but by the time i thought about getting the picture of it uh they were not playing it anymore it is called a kiss controller a what where a kiss controller okay as in i thought he said a little device you kiss this little device and that actually like they were shown like it does a bowling game and the better kissers you are the better you bowl and you're actually kissing this it is i i didn't want to approach it because i didn't want to you do it myself i wanted to get a picture of somebody else doing it interesting wow they were putting those booth babes to work weren't they i was like and there was this other game that had like a gas mask and i didn't know what that was i don't know what that was but the guy was wearing like a full on gas mask and playing you know might have been like some virtual reality type of thing as well but it also tried to breathing or something i don't know maybe that was just to protect him from the fanboy wink this clearly would have been the type of thing that used to be in kensha hall yes awesome yeah that this stuff that stuff would have been intention because i mean the indicate stuff so it was a lot of the independent games and stuff and then they had normal games in there too that those were like on the edges you know that was the oh i've never thought of that before well now bobby i know you've got one more day left at e3 and i know as part of your day tomorrow you're going to twitter eric can twitter continue your twitter adventures where you let the uh listeners of your show and and the olr listeners who jump in there and want to follow you and direct you around too look at whatever but what else haven't you seen yet that you're like i've got to get this tomorrow before this stuff's done okay well um i want to see what everybody's talking about with saints road the third i want to see child of eden if i can find it you just need to talk to miklotov because that's exactly what he talked to us about today were those two games yeah so i i

okay i will i promise i just wasn't in that hall i've been in the cell for two days now i've pretty much been in the hall that like sony and nintendo is in so i think i'm done there and i'm going to go try to spend as much as i can in uh the main hall i'm considering trying to get in the line for the vita but if it's really longer than the wii uu line i think i'm gonna skip on that yeah miklotov waited four hours today so take it or leave it i guess and he said it was worth it but of course then he continued to say i'm not waiting in that wii u line so i don't know yeah yeah so so i don't know i may or may not do that i don't think so i really need to like catch up on some stuff i want to see that i want to see if i can get into the fable room to see that um and really just kind of go around and see you know see the stuff that's in that hall because like that's where they've got a retro video game museum has a booth here and that's the as said i want to kind of stop by and see that and um you know see there's the other like kenshaw hall type companies in that area but i haven't gone in and see um i haven't seen dead island yet you know i saw where it was in square enix's booth but i haven't actually seen it yet you gotta go down there's all that i need to go and kind of hit everything yet if you're gonna go see dead island you gotta run up to aubrey and talk to her like she

tonight so i i really appreciate it we all do and and one last kind of off topic thing as we were leaving e3 yeah i'm like walking along and there's a guy walking toward me i recognize him somewhat he's not looking up so he almost runs into me because i start trying to you know get his attention by getting in his face and uh dj tyrant almost ran right through me i didn't think he was going to the show floor today i wonder what he did all right well no no no he's got he's going to a party tonight and since his girlfriend has never been to e3 he basically took her over there just so they could see what was in the lobby and stuff like pin three is in lobby and the fourth stuff so i got you but but they're going to some party one of the e3 parties we got an invite to tonight cool though that's why they were there he was going as the place was closing and we were leaving and i recognized him so i got him you know he almost bowled me over how funny it's a small world i met i met up with dj kyron today nice nice all right well we'll be meeting up with you tomorrow bobby of course sadly those antics are not going to be broadcast but we're looking forward to the post e3 party in the magic kingdom so at electronica friday night so yeah we hopefully will get maybe maybe a little bit of video at flint's i don't know if dark soccer wears something pretty and she's willing to be on camera maybe we get something at flint's that'd be fun perhaps perhaps all right anyhow and i can't i cannot wait for that gift shop to take all my money i know it's gonna i wish they could take all my money it's gonna be like some of the reaction i saw to uh the wii u just just take my money nintendo just take it here you go all right all right take care buddy uh be safe uh tomorrow and tonight whatever you end up doing we'll see you tomorrow all right all right take care take care bobby the one and only bobby blackwolf of course doing the show before us at all games radio sunday nights he starts at five pacific we start at six pacific on sunday nights uh we will not be live this coming sunday but he will and it sounds like he's gonna have a hell of a show he's gonna have a celebrity bumper more impressions on the wii u so he could just take the whole four hours for all i care well that's it for our guests but i i you know and i i'm gonna go ahead and open up the skype line at 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio i noticed we don't have nearly the turnout tonight live that we did last night i think a lot of that is that you know most of what you guys have been able to watch and see you saw in those press conferences so maybe you're it's kind of out of your system at this point but i don't know if it's open if anyone does want to call us give us a call again it's 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio um well we just actually had a facebook post by naoki oh what did naoki say on uh facebook hot news the guy who is behind uh he's a music producer of ddr recently right the 2011s new ddr has been announced for we its name is dance dance revolution 2 its title concept is back to basic the originality of ddr is the part where you play with your feet we have concentrated on that part and created the content so that it will pursue the gameplay of traditional ddr ps not only for the casual fans but we consider this title will be something that could be enjoyed by core ddr fans for a long period of time as well we are aiming for the release of the title for this fall we will do our best to respond to your expectations so please look forward for it very interesting so now keep saying the ddr 2 on the we is going back to basics it basically without saying it none of this balance board and flinging the wiimote around gimmicky shit he's saying it is back to feet because that's what makes back to the feet sure forget it is it a new feature har where's my sad trombone i don't have a soundboard right now so dude you guys harmonize that was awesome all right well some of the other stories i have just to go over quickly some of these have developed in the pastio day or so uh that we didn't get got i feel like with bobby's little like dust thing i was like god i learned more about that than i've read anywhere or heard anything that was great but uh talking quickly about some of the other things that have come up uh just in the past 24 hours a lot of it has to do with nintendo i don't know if you guys heard about this and what you guys think make of this nintendo stock apparently went down five percent yesterday after the wii u was revealed and my question you guys do you think that's a big deal it was right after the keynote uh it went down to sixteen thousand nine hundred seventy yen that's roughly 212 dollars but that is down five percent a low that the company has not seen since before the launch of the original wii is this damning for them or is this eh whatever i think is people being fickle and then you know not thinking about it so but but if i'm not mistaken most of the gamers i'm seeing posting on twitter i mean no offense guys but i don't think it's the same people that are that are are following the uh japanese stock exchange or having a lot of impact on that or even know what stock is apart from chicken now hold on hold on i won't go that far i'm sure people have investments in things but it's a knee-jerk reaction you know the the stockholders gauged what they thought the public reaction was it wasn't like oh my god it's the second coming nintendo quick take our money except for a few people who were like take our money i wasn't like that but i'll buy one so it dipped it's five percent i mean that's a significant drop but over the next you know what year and a half two years demand will build nintendo will make it happen they'll announce a price i think right now everyone's worried that this thing has to be expensive they'll announce a price it'll be reasonable they'll sell a hajillion of them nintendo stock will be a hundred gazillion dollars and everything will be fine for nintendo and more fictional amounts well you know uh one thing that i did read about price is that even though nintendo has not said anything i guess there's been hints from things like you know conversations with executives indirect it will not be out for 250 oh no so we're looking at least probably 299 for this thing if not maybe even jumping up 349 or something well with all the competition you know out there at what is it sub 200 now for a 360 oh yeah and and 200 bucks for the top end 360 or ps3 you gotta wonder how far nintendo can push that without seeing the uh the competition gets some some bump from it uh now speaking of stock and i wanted to mention this but i'll let the chatters say it because uh they said it too chat.org.com zappy says stocks fluctuate not a big deal apple went down too after worldwide developer conference that's that's the first thing in my mind is that well don't these things usually dip after apple press conferences and especially when all the stuff happened with the antenna you know and their little apology press conference they did with that i'm sure stock dips for them a lot too but they they're apple and they're still doing just fine all these years later yeah they're making a couple bucks just a couple bucks not doing too bad now several people in chat have mentioned this and uh black wolf's now saying he's in chat now kind of cooling off with the listeners they're talking to them uh did you guys cover that nintendo announced that they were ditching friend codes i had not heard that until i walked into studio somebody posted it in chat earlier but apparently nintendo will be ditching friend codes for the wii u good finally applause good job that's one way to get the hardcore gamer base back that's smart i wonder if they've said much more about online let me look tiger claws giving us a little link here so we can take a peek let's see i'm going right now to this story at mtv multiplayer blog because nintendo or mtv is all about the video games i know what's that about actually i hear i don't read a whole lot of these big blogs but i hear the mtv ones pretty good i just i don't have time there's the knees in action well yeah that's the whole super mario brothers me yeah they were talking about i think it's cute let's see um on hand at e3 ubisoft producer adrian blunt according to him the day of friend codes are gone demonstrating ghost recon online for the wii u um i asked him equivalent to a gamer tag on xbox live yeah exactly he said uh what else is there there's a few things on that the first is the ability for individuals to make accounts rather than a machine having an account each individual user has an account so that's an account uh he continued saying also the ability to easily find friends rather than using friend codes which we've had in the past we're able to connect players in a much easier way which allows us to have a community that's playing together in the game blunt wasn't willing to get more specific about the online functionality you know what that sounds like to me remember a couple weeks ago on the show we were speculating that the system tied into facebook somehow i don't like exactly facebook but i bet you anything this whole like find your friends online is going to be some type of maybe that's where the nintendo stream comes in folks maybe the nintendo stream is the online component and the stream is so and so has been playing super mario we and so and so just got caught and catch me i see dan laughing over there you think i'm full of it or oh no no i was laughing about the fact that nintendo has products called the we and the stream but now now that i think about it hearing that i'm like oh the nintendo stream that would make perfect sense it's like you know funny it's what aol aol calls it the live stream right there um updates and stuff yeah yeah so now you can make a stream which i don't use of course i'm i'm obviously the nintendo stream thing was like total fanboy wank speculation i don't think there was a lot to back that up but i'm just having fun with the what ifs but i i still think the facebook concept of nintendo record i i got mildly curious and there are already a full page of search results for weu fan pages uh tiger claw in our chat says i bet the gamer tag thing nintendo has coming is tied to your club nintendo account your club nintendo account has a username that's definitely possible um sure why not why not you have a database you own nintendo hardware there you go well that sucks because i didn't get the name i wanted then bitches and frisbee says oh shit more facebook like crap you know it's one of those things that could be done very well or very crappy i mean how vague is that but seriously like i hear facebook i don't necessarily think that has to be crap because i think a lot of us think of facebook crap as my feed filling up with come play farm bill with me and you know and you can hide that crap and so and so filled out a survey and said something about you hide yeah exactly hide no i do that too but it's just frustrating that bullshit shows up in the first place yeah but if nintendo were to somehow kind of contain all that a little better might be interesting i'm ignoring all those fucking people anyway again the phones are open if you do want to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on skype is orange lounge radio um if we don't get any calls i'll kind of close quote unquote with this story the weu reel that was showing off some of the third-party games this has been igniting the internet today is apparently using 360 and playstation 3 footage and a lot of people are going fail nintendo oh nintendo why didn't you tell people this is 360 ps3 you're be it you're lyin nintendo and uh i'm kind of thinking is this really a big deal like i can't believe like i kind of figured it was pc or 360 footage because i don't know the system's a year away i know right but they've got the licenses for it they've and keep in mind for all the third-party stuff it's probably what they've been provided by the developers absolutely right absolutely right and i bet a lot of these things were a lot of these deals were probably sealed a month a month two months ago very short time yeah these games are concepts still i and i can tell you this just okay and this is from designer when you're working for a client and you say okay well you want your want me to advertise this product for you i need some of your images they will send you what they have of the item they don't care how big it is they don't care what it originally was on they're just sending you pictures of the item what you know their pr has approved so you get you know you get what they give you whatever you're nintendo how stupid can you be seriously it's i know exactly what you're saying i remember back in like the genesis days and the atari days where they'd show a screenshot of a game and it'd be for all these systems and you know it was the the screenshot of the best looking version but nintendo's out there to make a statement nintendo's out there to say this is our system and this is what it could do okay fine do what you got to do put the put the code on your pc mock-up of of the wii u and play the game and hope that it runs and if it runs great put it on your video don't throw these pictures out into the world and be like this is what our system will do and then like a day later be like oh by the way yeah that that's that's the competition system no no at least don't admit it lie you're nintendo you've lied before dungeon buster says they're placeholders to give the crowd an impression of what it could do right exactly i understand that i have a problem with that you have a problem with everything no i don't i'm not mad i have a problem with you yes of course you do i it it wasn't i mean the smarter thing to do would have been to put in super tiny print in the bottom corner like conceptual video based on existing game footage or something you know something just to cover their ass whatever but they didn't do that they put those pictures out there they put the pictures especially you know the one the one game in there that really got a pop was when ninja guy den showed up right and everybody was like oh fuck it's ninja guy den and it's on the wii u and it looks really really cool yeah you should have known that was the ps3 version of the 360 version kids the one that kind of left me like okay maybe it wasn't smart to do that was the ghost recon where they were showing like the scope and it gave you that impression that somebody was using their little wii u controller as the scope like it just that's what it looked like to me but it was off in the 360 version of the ps3 version but if it's true about the guts of this machine it's gonna be basically a 360 with some extra little frills maybe a boost in the ram a boost in the shading graphical components of it and so forth i mean nintendo's going all in that their system has to be at least as good as the 360 or the ps3 systems that have existed for five years now so i think it's safe to say their system will be graphically capable of more than that absolutely it's going to at least be this level of graphics this generation and that is why they showed they did show that little you know for what it's worth that little random ass asian flower face asian flower flying in the bird into the the the pool and everybody went shit what is that looks really good that was the wii u that doesn't exist anywhere else well that was the wii u's development system right so you know is is a high spec pc so and if and if i see okay well that's capable then i'm sure they can pull off the 360 ps3 back in the day when the when the playstation demo disc was out and it had all the ducks and you know all over the water and that t-rex and the t-rex and when everyone's like oh wow that's neat how many games did we get that really look like that until the end of the playstation's life true well right it's just that kind of thing you know it's it's all it's so early people are people are obsessing over the tiniest detail of a system that's a year and a half away and will change and will not be the same when it comes out it'll be better it'll be better than the stuff that's out there now well it can't not be because you cannot buy graphical components that are as weak as the stuff that's in the ps3 and the 360 now it doesn't exist they're gonna be better they're not gonna be next generation better they're going to be peak of this generation better that's how nintendo rolls it's a bridge i didn't you know this whole like generation to generation nintendo has basically said with this that they they're not following that rule they're just following what the markets want or what have you what was that uh from the chat room colibri for yeah that was me that was jamie um i i kind of though one of the fears that i have is that it's gonna pull a dreamcast that since it's coming out well before other systems of uh of this nature do you think that it might actually end up shooting itself in the foot no because it's nintendo and sega only ever really had sonic you know i mean and i'm saying like as far as like catching and getting people and drawing them in and so forth i mean if nintendo's launching with the smash brothers game they got nothing to worry about nintendo's not launching with the smash brothers game it won't be out until that system's uh first holiday season interesting which will be the season i think the only system that ever launched with the smash brothers game at least close to launched was the cube right which by the way we found out today you won't be playing that on the wii u because the wii u has taken out the game cube compatibility that's right i you know what we've got a game cube don't care i know i'm kind of like that i'm not too surprised about that because nintendo usually doesn't do backwards compatible two generations back it's kind of like your ds your ds 3ds or whatever won't play gameboy advance games you know they took that out way back in the dsi right yeah right yeah so i mean that however our ps3 will play ps1 games you couldn't play gameboy games on your ds even though the slot was the same size your ps3 will play atari 2600 games it's not even the same company it's amazing all right well i guess everybody's being shy tonight we're not getting any calls that's okay what's up with that people fuck you people i mean i mean hi i've closed the sky so now you guys can't call and talk to me that's right i've decided let's go get pinkberry not to do it i already had pinkberry so and it sucked you're trying to make me fat all right no we are going to uh wrap up our e3 coverage however and uh call it a night i know we didn't go as long as last night but let's face it all the news most of it was yesterday but i want to thank again bobby blackwolf and me glitov for their on the floor impressions i learned a lot from that i learned a lot more from that than i did for some of these press conferences so big thanks to them as well um and uh thanks to you guys for tuning in and listening to us over the past couple days just programming notes coming up we will not be doing this said he was going to call but he was in the bathroom loser goddamn lie all right fine i'll open it

june the 19th we will be back live at all games radio for more information visit our website at orange lounge radio yeah missy is a cheese farm they grow cheese on vines not letting us go all night you know what i'll just try calling him do it fuck this well i don't see him online either this is a problem skype fails skype emergency there we go hi you're on orange launch radio whoever could this be wow you guys you guys are just so loving you know four weeks later loving yeah yeah what do you want well i just have one thing to say pretty much yes that um i'm actually i can't take it anymore i'm sick of it and um i'm finally going to file divorce from nintendo oh my gosh somebody called judge mabel why do you make nintendo hit you ronma after that presentation and my friends going nuts on twitter about about their pre about their presser we kind of came to agreement that nintendo is that abusive girlfriend that you always take back just thinking that things are going to be different the next time around there is genuine concern in the chat room what will happen to black luigi he will be replaced by shadow the hedgehog oh my god that's trading down really really really far and i'm a sega fan my shadow really at least be knuckles dan if it's any consideration is this a black thing when i walk into a block brother stay black let him talk look dan if it makes you feel any better joe vidya will kick my ass when she sees me dressed as shadow because she is not a shadow fangirl well she's more of a sonic and tails fangirl joe vidya three more times for the rest of us all right uh i i gotta talk more about why why this nintendo hatred what about when i i have to admit i loved it when reggie came out and we've said this before and said gamers want this and they want this so whatever you guys are confusing but here i don't know what gamers he's listening to but i didn't ask for a a six-inch android tablet with a hacked classic controller on each side i had one of those i just want one of those as a system you don't want to put it on your table and play othello no that would be awesome like ben heck to make it what about though the fact though rama that we are still a year away i mean the reason why i'm i'm still kind of like it was all right their presentation was fine i'm not like super excited about it i'm gonna buy one anyway because i'm a consumer whore and i buy them all and help but i'm like we're not really gonna see this system for another year maybe by then they'll actually get their shit together so are you basically giving your abusive girlfriend a year to shape up or ship out i suppose so but it's okay because i will be i will be marrying its younger sister the 3ds ah so the 3ds you were a fan of all the stuff you saw there okay yes uh mario kart yes even i am a mario kart whore like nobody else's business that that's a given and i missed super mario but i went back and watched a trailer for it and i said this is the mario game i've been looking for a 3d platformer that plays like 2d but it's three this is what i wanted right i will sit here and play that i'm not too fond it's called super mario but hey whatever i think it might still be a working title so it seems so it seems to me that you've got this uh relationship with the big sister but really you just want to sleep with the little sister well well yeah that's why i have a ds okay wow all right well rama any other closing thoughts on e3 before we let you go uh let's see then microsoft was a bit of a snore sony had me with with the vita and i'll say this right now yes the vita with 3g powered by at&t it's gonna be 299 but i'm telling you when it comes out you'll be able to get it for 99.99 with a two-year contract mark my word that's not that's not how they sell ipads though that's how they sell iphones ipads iphones netbooks with 3g hell it worked for the taco didn't it well kind of yeah but we got ours for free i think this is a relevant question rama since you are black luigi and we call you that just so people know we call you that because whenever you you you cosplay and you're black and you you dress up as luigi you make your way on camera no matter who's there and we always see you on tv oh it's black luigi there he is that's why you have that name and so tiger klon chat says rama what do you think of luigi's mansion too since you know it's a game starring luigi nintendo finally showing some luigi love i'm all for it because you know i've always said this i've always said that peach is nothing more than a than a whore because mario's always chasing after her to save her she doesn't freak out when bowser kidnaps her you know happens three times a month i know and look they're a coupe of kids we all know who the mother is you know we already know i feel like you have designed this really weird sick mario rp world while really really fucking high i actually i was so brett the time it was very loose and i said this to a friend of mine and it broke him and all my other friends are like holy shit that actually makes sense bowser you are the father all right anyway look luigi has a nice mansion a nice car his girl is in check he's got the good life i mean really but really luigi's mansion a 10 year old game coming back you're all for it yeah i actually believe it or not i actually liked the first luigi's mansion i thought it was a fun game hey i think it's a neat hey rama princess daisy don't want no scrub dad she has an eyeball in the back of her head all right rama we're gonna let you go she stays in the castle okay hey she also plays a mean round of tennis why do you think why do you think luigi got on one knee and proposed rama i'm ending this conversation right now have a good one stay black all right bye you know the daisy does have an eyeball in the back of her head oh it was a graphic glitch but someone that was awesome still i like that someone in moogan actually programmed an attack with the weird eye in the back of her head it's because people in moogan have too much free time i know it's great okay you're sitting on the internet doing a podcast about e3 and you're telling the moogan people they have too much free time way too much free time it's true all right that's it we're uh ending the show thank you guys for tuning into our e3 coverage especially those of you that are tuned in be it live or through the podcast feed we really appreciate it so we're gonna take a little uh break you know because there's it's gonna be dead next week with uh with e3 being done uh tomorrow you know
