00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,520
Tonight, November 6th, 2011, a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto is unveiled, a major

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:29,760
MMO goes free to play, and what is in store for the Wii next after Skyward Sword?

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,520
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:47,280
We are live tonight, November the 6th of 2011, with the 434th show of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,500
We were off last week, but we're back tonight to join you over the next few hours live to

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,760
talk about video games and gaming culture and have some lols, hopefully.

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,700
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,000
Say hello over there to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hi.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How are you?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm tired, Rob.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
It's been especially a little while since we've heard from you, because we were unexpectedly

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
sort of off last week, I mean, that all came up at the last minute, but you had been gone

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
the week before because you were at Disneyland.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Yes.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,840
Or as I was saying on the show, you were at Blizzcon a little too late.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,520
I was actually, I met some Blizzcon people that were staying at our hotel.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Nice.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
And they were calling it DizCon.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard that term before.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,880
I've wanted to go, here's my thing with Blizzcon, as much as I love the Blizzard products, I'm

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,080
sorry, I'm not paying $150 to go to your publicly open press conference and play your demos,

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,520
like I don't get, does not compute function, but I will totally go to go to all the hotel

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,400
parties because there's some sweet parties that get thrown, and then like DizCon, I'll

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,040
go for that, because like, shit, I go to Disneyland all the time anyway.

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
If you listen to the show any length of time, you know that.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,360
I just kept running in though to other WoW players, and so I'd go talk to them, and Dan

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,520
would just roll his eyes and go somewhere else, because he pretty much hates it.

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
The WoWs.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
He hates the WoWs.

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
All right.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
And I've got a new obsession too, which is the WoW model viewer.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, we'll talk about that in a little bit.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,200
I've got to introduce, he doesn't play WoW, so if you're worried about this becoming the

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,500
Warcraft show, don't worry, we've got tons of other games tonight, Techmaster Loki's

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
in the house.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
No, I don't play WoW.

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
To not talk about WoW.

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I do not play WoW.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,080
But he will talk about food, but we were a little concerned because you didn't bring,

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,420
like if you've listened to the show for any length of time, Loki always brings food with

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,180
him to the show from a random fast food place, but not tonight.

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,360
And I was like, are you feeling okay, Loki?

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
He brought with him a Red Bull.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,520
Should have been two Red Bulls, because that Red Bull one, it's just not enough by itself.

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Was the kid keeping you up last night?

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
No, it's just like drinking your Red Bulls.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,560
Oh, I thought you needed energy.

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Well, no.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,960
It seriously allows me to concentrate and get more work done at work without being distracted

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
as much.

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
Because productivity gets way higher with Red Bull.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,520
Now, hold on, or they're gonna have to start paying you to say that here on the show, so.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,880
Well, they wanna pay me in like a big tub of Red Bull.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,720
Get that little car to drive around and come give you some.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
But Dark Sakura fed you some of her, I guess, extra dinner or whatever.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,640
Were you just cooking for the fun of it?

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
I wanted beef stew because it's gotten cold outside.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,500
And I had broth, you know, stuff to make broth out of, so I just made, I made a vegetable

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,960
broth in the crock pot overnight, and then I made the beef stew in the morning.

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,320
And crock pot cooking is in right now.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,440
Like I notice a lot of people are like really into it.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,880
It never went out.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
It's easy.

67
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I don't know why.

68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Like it just seems like I'm noticing it more.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,640
The Paula Deen recipe for pot roast is amazing.

70
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
And I'm not just talking about-

71
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
How much butter?

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,520
There's not a lot of butter, but there's a lot of sodium.

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
A lot of sodium.

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,440
I see them more prevalent at Target.

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,080
I see it mentioned more on blogs, on Facebook.

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
I don't know.

77
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Maybe it's the economy.

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,400
Well, honestly, it makes perfect sense because you can make a lot of food to last you for

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,800
a week in the crock pot.

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,960
You know, you can have it cook while you're at work or whatever, and you come home and

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
it's hot dinner.

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,320
It's like having your own, you know, servant, except you did all the work, but you didn't

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
cook it.

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
And you forgot that you did all the work.

85
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
It was cooked.

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,600
You come home and it's cooked, and it's good.

87
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
All right.

88
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Well, believe it or not, we talk about more than food here on Orange Lounge Radio.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,120
If it's your first time listening to the show, I'll just kind of reintroduce the show here

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,980
real quick because it's been a while.

91
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,800
We are three friends that all met about 10 years ago at this point, all playing a popular

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,160
video game at the arcades called Dance Dance Revolution.

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
And we used to go to these marathon sessions of playing that at the arcade, and we would

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
go to dinner afterwards with other friends, and we just sat around and talked shit about

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,480
video games, whether it be DDR or whatever else is at the arcade, for hours and hours

96
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
afterwards.

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,860
And I had been dabbling in internet radio, so at Dark Sakura before that.

98
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,900
And so we decided to kind of take that into an internet radio show, and Loki joined us

99
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
along the way.

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
And that's where Orange Lounge Radio was born.

101
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,880
We pride ourselves on the fact that we interact.

102
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
We do the show live.

103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,180
We always have.

104
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,320
Very rare, we're not live.

105
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,660
Usually it has to be a computer issue or something.

106
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:09,920
But out of the 434 episodes we'd have, I'd say about 430 of those are probably live,

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,080
and interacting with you guys in our chat room.

108
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
We have you guys in chat giving live commentary on the show.

109
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
So you guys can call us later in the show.

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,880
We like to embrace new social media as it comes out.

111
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,200
So Facebook, we're on there.

112
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Twitter, we're on there.

113
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
We give it a big kiss.

114
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320
That's why we call it the show where every gamer has a voice.

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,660
Because, you know, we're not paid.

116
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,920
Very rarely are we sent advance review copies of things, or get free perks for this, because

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,740
we've always been very independent.

118
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,680
So we like to think we're giving you just a truly honest perspective.

119
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,000
And sometimes that honest perspective is, I don't have time this week to play every

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
single freaking game that's out right now.

121
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,640
I will say people do want to send us advance copies, we'll be happy to accept them.

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Exactly.

123
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Exactly.

124
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
I will never say no to that.

125
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,040
I don't care what it is.

126
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,080
But I will say this, is that the holiday season is upon us now, and that's kind of what I

127
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
wanted to move into, is the holiday season is upon us now, and we're in that month every

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,580
year in video games where everything is coming out.

129
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,920
And I just, I know you guys have got to be feeling this too.

130
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,520
I really don't have time to play everything.

131
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,040
And like I am a Warcraft player, as we were talking about at the beginning of the show,

132
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,380
and as if that didn't need enough time, like now there's all these other games out I'm

133
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,080
trying to play, and there's just not enough time.

134
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,000
And Skyrim is out on Friday, and I'm just thinking like, oh god, that's going to be

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,040
another suck in my time away, and I'm hearing it's great, which I was expecting, so yay,

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,520
I don't have enough time to play everything.

137
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,120
What games are you guys looking forward to this holiday season, if anything?

138
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,280
Dark Sakura, is there anything, maybe it's already out?

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm looking forward to sleeping.

140
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,440
I'm looking forward to the semester being over, so I can actually play the shit I have.

141
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,880
Honestly, because, I mean, I started playing Symphony of the Night again, and I've just

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,400
been too tired to really play anything other than, you know, WoW and the other couple things

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm playing.

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,720
It's honestly, if it comes out and it falls into my lap, I'll be happy to play it.

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,560
If it comes out and it's something that I want, I'll find a way to make it happen, but

146
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,900
right now, I'm just not really doing the looking forward to anything kind of deal, I'm doing

147
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,440
the get me through the next three weeks, we go to print next week.

148
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
This week, we go to print, fuck me, we go to print this week.

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Oh my god.

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
IRL stuff.

151
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,040
Um, Loki, what are you looking forward to this holiday?

152
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,440
Like I had to ask, like I had to ask, and that's Tuesday, right?

153
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Next Tuesday.

154
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh, next Tuesday.

155
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,760
Do you have any special events lined up, like did you take Wednesday off work?

156
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,920
Do you have anything planned special?

157
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,720
No, I'm just gonna play it.

158
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,920
Nope, just gonna play it.

159
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Just gonna play it.

160
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,240
Going to our chat room for some comments, chat.orangeslantrady.com, talking about the

161
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,160
free games that we don't get.

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,960
Dark Tetsuya says, Loki, would you play anything even if it's Skylanders 2?

163
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Going back to what you said.

164
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,360
If you're gonna send me a free copy of that, I'll do something creative with those toys.

165
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,200
You know what, looking at Twitter, and kind of getting the feel for what people are saying,

166
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm seeing a lot of positive stuff about it, especially from the people that have kids.

167
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,520
Really seem to enjoy, like Skylanders is a fun game to play with kids.

168
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,400
Glad that they were able to lower their standards for their kids.

169
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,500
Because you know, kids, they're definitely not attached to stupid toys nowadays, and

170
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,240
trust me, Activision is getting behind publishing games that are on the DS for a lot of those

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,600
stupid toys that you're just like, I don't understand why these kids like that.

172
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,600
But you know what, that's fine, and I understand, I'm not trying to sound like the bitter old

173
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,120
man or whatever that's like, oh, I don't understand these kids, I don't understand

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,200
these kids' games and their toys and blah blah blah, no seriously, their toys are stupid

175
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
compared to the stuff that we used to have.

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,280
I mean, our toys used to do stuff, I mean, it may have been stupid things like, you know,

177
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,080
karate chopping arm and stuff, but you know what, Teddy Ruxpin was the fucking future,

178
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
he could read anything.

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
I have a Teddy Ruxpin.

180
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,920
I know you do.

181
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
And Grubby.

182
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,000
And most of the...

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My buddy.

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,480
Wherever you go, he goes.

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,520
I had one of those things, and man, his face is definitely hard, and you can do some serious

186
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,520
injuries to other people with that stuff.

187
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:24,880
No, but, I'm just saying, okay, Skylanders, you gotta, yeah, I understand your kids are

188
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,160
gonna have fun with that game, because it's like, oh look, the toys come to life, and

189
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,600
it's so much fun, but seriously, you as a responsible parent need to understand that

190
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,960
it's just a ploy to get you to buy the toys and this really expensive game that you don't

191
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
need.

192
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,640
Hell, you know what, buy your kids a good game, and buy them some other toys that are

193
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
also very good.

194
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,600
I just wanna say, for those that didn't have the privilege of growing up when, you know,

195
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,000
these old people here on this program grew up, just let me take you back a few years

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
here as to what we were into at the time.

197
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Here you go.

198
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Now, it wasn't necessarily into My Buddy, but my parents bought it for me.

199
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
It's just a giant fucking doll, okay, I mean, that's all it is.

200
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
It's just like...

201
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,960
Kid's sister's at a tea party, though.

202
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,600
I mean, it was just seriously, I mean, it could have been just a Cabbage Patch doll,

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
but...

204
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
That's probably what it was trying to capitalize on.

205
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Seriously.

206
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
I had Cabbage Patch Kids.

207
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Sorry for the poor audio on that, YouTube doesn't balance our ideas.

208
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
And I'm not saying that that toy was good.

209
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,720
That toy was not good at all, yeah, I recognize that it was, and yeah, Teddy Ruxpin was kind

210
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,160
of an interesting toy because that, you know, had, you know, it was a thing that played

211
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,000
tapes, you know, cassette tapes.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,040
I know some kids that are maybe even listening to the show don't know what that is, but cassette

213
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,360
tapes, and they would actually move their mouth to the stuff, you know, the actual audio

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,460
because I think they had it split or something like that, and that's how it worked.

215
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,560
And it would read stories to you, and interact, they had the little playsets and stuff like

216
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
that.

217
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
And those are kind of cool, I mean, because at the time it was like pretty cutting edge

218
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
stuff.

219
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
But...

220
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm sorry, I love this comment in our chat room, AlphaKananagram says, I had a My Buddy,

221
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,680
but then I saw a movie or clips of a Chucky movie and stopped playing with it.

222
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh my god, you know what?

223
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,360
Can't say I blame you there.

224
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,760
Yesterday, and okay, I'm on the American River Review staff, and we sometimes go in on Saturdays

225
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,480
and Sundays to do extra work.

226
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,640
So we play movies.

227
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:53,200
And yesterday we were watching an MST3K movie that was called The Devil Doll, about this

228
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
mannequin and we just kept singing the My Buddy theme over and over every time the mannequin

229
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,480
would show up on the screen.

230
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,080
It's been so long since we've done a show, I didn't talk about the haunted house that

231
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
I went to a couple weeks ago.

232
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Oh, talk about it.

233
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,360
Oh my god, okay, so we went to one of those cheesy haunted house things that they take

234
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,720
the old store that like one of the circuit cities that closed down, that they haven't

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,400
been able to get something else in there and they turned it into like this Uber haunted

236
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
house.

237
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Right.

238
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,240
And one of the scarier ones that we went into, and I usually, usually like, you know, I kind

239
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,600
of approach this stuff with a haha, this stuff's derpy and dorky or whatever, but these guys

240
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
did a really good job.

241
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,820
And I can't remember the name of the haunted house, but it was out for the local folks

242
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,360
to Sacramento, California, it was out in Roseville, right across from the Dave and Busters out

243
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
there.

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,140
Like, I don't know what some furniture store used to be over there and they turned it into

245
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,480
a haunted house.

246
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,880
And they had one that was all Halloween themed or it was all Halloween themed stupid.

247
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,200
They had one that was all Hollywood themed and they had like all the recreations of the

248
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
different movies.

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
And like one of the rooms had a Chucky doll and like, it was really like scary and good

250
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
life.

251
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
And then it started moving.

252
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,200
They had a freaking midget as the Chucky doll.

253
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
That's awesome.

254
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
It started following you around.

255
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,600
It was like freaky and like, yeah, they were really good at scaring people because they

256
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,440
had, and this, this was the only way, like some people would do it.

257
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,080
They had a rule like a strip club.

258
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
We don't touch you.

259
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
You don't touch us.

260
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,840
Like there was a no touching rule, but they will get right up in your face and all this

261
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
stuff.

262
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,680
They had a Freddy Krueger that had like sparks coming out.

263
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
I mean, it was awesome.

264
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,400
It was really well done, but the Chucky doll, just the whole talk about that made me think

265
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
of this.

266
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I will say this though.

267
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
They had all these different themed areas.

268
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,360
One of them was a hospital theme.

269
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,680
It was just like silent Hill and clearly had its inspiration.

270
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,920
I would have wanted to see that.

271
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Oh my gosh.

272
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Are there nurses?

273
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh, well they didn't like have.

274
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
People in the silent Hill costume.

275
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,160
Like I don't, they didn't, but being in there definitely felt like it had the huge inspiration

276
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
from silent Hill.

277
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Actually.

278
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
They did have some real cut up nurses.

279
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
They just didn't have like the face, like the face is wrapped in gauze type of thing.

280
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
They didn't really have that.

281
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,160
Well, that was only in, um, the movie that they had the face wrapped in gauze.

282
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,040
They had that in, um, they were faceless in a couple of the others and then just had

283
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,960
these kinds of modeled faces.

284
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,600
Don't, don't test me on my silent Hill.

285
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,040
I'm not, I'm not.

286
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,640
So one of the other things that truly scared me was the dentist in there cause like, you

287
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,920
know, the dentist is scary and had an air gun that you didn't know he had until it's

288
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,440
just the right person, which happened to be me walk by and you have the drilling noises

289
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,160
and all of a sudden, and I was like, that was exactly the sound you made.

290
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Yeah.

291
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,600
You know, that's what happens when like 10 gay guys in their hag, I'll go to a haunted

292
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
house together.

293
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,080
You know, it's going back to the toys and you know, buying your kids, Skylanders and

294
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
stuff like that.

295
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Okay.

296
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,920
Would you rather, you know, spend $200 on Skylanders and their, their toys or buy them

297
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,520
like, I mean $200 you can buy a really nice, you know, toy or something or a lot of toys

298
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,240
for $200 and I can guarantee they'll probably have a lot more fun than they do with Skylanders.

299
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,280
Yeah, that's a neat concept, but yeah, I mean, come on.

300
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,520
You can buy a cheap arcade cabinet for that.

301
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,360
One of my friends is building an arcade cabinet and it made me think of you actually.

302
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,320
I'm seeing all the pictures on Facebook and everything and it just totally, it totally

303
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,360
reminded me of when we lived together and you built that arcade cabinet that the TV

304
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
was in.

305
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Yeah, it was a mistake.

306
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,640
Oh man, those were the days.

307
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,080
So since we're talking about cool toys that you could spend like $200 on, uh, did they

308
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,320
have this or do they have this now that they had when I was a kid?

309
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:36,800
Cause this is what I would spend $200 on.

310
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Domino rally was the shit.

311
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,080
Like your dominoes would do like loop de loops.

312
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,360
Check out that awesome 80s power music to this commercial and like dominoes would go

313
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:56,640
down slides and this took all day to set up for like 10 seconds of fun.

314
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,240
Domino rally, get all three sets.

315
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,000
I would have spent $200 on domino rally.

316
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,920
All right, anyway, uh, I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks, but dark Sakura left,

317
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,240
so I guess we'll do things out of order.

318
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Uh, we'll move into our gaming weeks, the types of video games that you have been playing

319
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
this week.

320
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
And Loki will start tonight with you since, um, dark soccer left the room real quick.

321
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,520
Her husband just got home, so I think she had to go tend to mainly grand theft auto

322
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
four usual.

323
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,880
Um, you know, still playing lost and damned.

324
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,120
We moved to airport games now.

325
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,760
And my coworker was getting slightly better at, uh, killing people in the airport.

326
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,560
And of course I refined my technique and now I'm up there with him again.

327
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,920
Uh, but we're having some pretty high scoring games, like $3,000 games, which is pretty

328
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
awesome.

329
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,560
Um, and then of course, uh, actually played a little bit of saints road, the second or

330
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,960
saints row two on PC, uh, with a wonderful add on patch from, um, a group, uh, called

331
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,720
idle Ninja.

332
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,280
And they have a patch, uh, mod, if you will, called gentlemen of the row.

333
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,800
And what it does is it fixes a lot of stuff that's in, in the game that was buggy because

334
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,640
the saints row two PC version is a terrible, terrible port, but they fixed it for the most

335
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,760
part and they've added a lot of cool stuff to it, new weapons, new, um, you know, slider

336
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
abilities.

337
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,960
You can make your character look really ridiculous.

338
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,360
I had some like topless green chick that it was really hideous looking.

339
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,160
It was just like some, I don't even know what, and I actually, I'm going to start a new game

340
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,200
because I don't want to look at that character anymore.

341
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,280
It's just weird.

342
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:45,240
But um, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff and new gang types and clothing options and

343
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,480
just all sorts of crazy stuff.

344
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,920
And of course, you know, that's a free mod to download.

345
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,680
So worth checking out if you have the PC version cause it probably would fix a lot of the problems

346
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
that you have there.

347
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,060
Just gearing up, you know, for saints row the third, which hopefully I'll be playing

348
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,920
this week at some point.

349
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,040
And um, and then let's see, other than that, I played a plants versus zombies on the iPod

350
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,840
again and went back to that a little bit.

351
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,240
I'm on the roof now and they had a huge sale at Halloween time too.

352
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,200
I think you could get it for like 99 cents.

353
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Yeah.

354
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I mean, I liked the game.

355
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,760
It's, it's a little annoying that it just keeps ramping, like it keeps changing the

356
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,360
game like every single level.

357
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,000
Now mind it like, do you want the same stage as every level?

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That would be boring.

359
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,440
It just, it should get more difficult, you know, just like, I don't know.

361
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
They put new game mechanics in every stage.

362
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Yes.

363
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Exactly.

364
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Um, and that's fine.

365
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,040
You know, it's pretty cool.

366
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,640
So I've been playing a little bit of that and then, um, what else?

367
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,480
Uh, that's pretty much it actually just not hold on, but I mean, I can't wait.

368
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm just like, ah, I need the, I need the safe for the third.

369
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
I need it.

370
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,320
Hoping your distributor connections will come through and you can get the game early this

371
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
week.

372
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
We'll see.

373
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,680
After, after the week I've had, um, just next Sunday is going to be a big gaming week show

374
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,960
because hopefully look, you'll have that.

375
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I'll have Skyrim, dark soccer will have, I don't know what she'll have, but it'll be

376
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
good.

377
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,600
I'll have a weekend that I can sleep through.

378
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
All right.

379
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Dark soccer.

380
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Uh, sorry we started without you, but we'll go back and do your gaming.

381
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
That's okay.

382
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I had to potty.

383
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, I thought you ran out and said hi to Dan cause I already got home.

384
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
All right.

385
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Well, what's up?

386
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
How was your gaming week?

387
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Um, I played well and I played DC universe online, which is kind of ass.

388
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
You didn't like it?

389
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,080
Well, I'm not saying that I hated it, but the control is really crabby and I hate that

390
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,940
you have to keep turning the camera as you're running and doing everything.

391
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,400
And with my trackball mouse, it's just not reasonable.

392
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,920
I mean I could do it really easy in portal too, but I can't really do it for DC universe.

393
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
You know why?

394
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Why?

395
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Because it sucks?

396
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Well, no, not because it sucks.

397
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I mean maybe it sucks.

398
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Cause trackball sucks.

399
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I don't know how you do it.

400
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I hate trackballs.

401
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Mainly because I think the game is meant more to played with a controller than, cause using

402
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,480
like a right analog stick to control your camera is kind of natural for a lot of people.

403
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,840
You might want to give it another go with an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your computer

404
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,240
if you have any wired ones because the game will pick it right up because the game was

405
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,920
designed to be console slash, you know, kind of like Final Fantasy 11 was and you felt

406
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,720
more comfortable with that on the controller.

407
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,640
That might be the trick or it might not.

408
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
I don't know.

409
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
I mean DC universe is very different kind of game.

410
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,960
But I've also been playing more with keyboard and mouse so much lately and keep in mind

411
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,200
using a regular controller actually hurts my hands after awhile.

412
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,800
So I can't play a game for a long period of time like I can if you use keyboard and mouse.

413
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,160
You should try one of those things that look like a kickboard that they were pimping on

414
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,120
all games network awhile back.

415
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Oh no.

416
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
That thing was painful.

417
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Oh yeah.

418
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
We, we, uh, I gave them to you.

419
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,280
No, actually no you didn't, but I saw one at the store and it's too painful.

420
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
It's too bad.

421
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
It was painful.

422
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
I don't know if I remember seeing one, um, I don't remember what they're even called

423
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,240
now, but they look like they had all these weird, uh, almost like a spider like thing

424
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,060
over the controller that you hear.

425
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,720
It's supposed to improve your reaction time by like hitting the different buttons by kind

426
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
of moving your fingers in different ways and something like that.

427
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah, they're terrible.

428
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,120
My coworker just went home, uh, Brad from pod cultures in our chat room right now and

429
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,480
says a pack controls are just fine.

430
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
Use a 360 controller.

431
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,800
So another vote to, uh, try a controller, I guess I was again, I know, I know, but just,

432
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm just saying, yeah, I mean, honestly I'm playing a PC game because I want to play a

433
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,880
PC game and you know, it's, it's fine.

434
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,520
There's also, I ran into way too many derps by the time I got through the brainiac thing.

435
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,400
I think right now is not a good time to get into DC universe.

436
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,040
You want to wait a month or two to be honest, it's going to be moot anyway cause star Trek

437
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
online.

438
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
True.

439
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,680
I was talking about this on Horde house, the Warcraft show I do this week and um, you know,

440
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,100
we had a guest on that was talking about the star Wars MMO that's coming out and he was

441
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,240
playing the beta of that and I said, there's no way in hell I'm playing this when it comes

442
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
out.

443
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
It's like, why not?

444
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
It's great.

445
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,000
I said, because you don't want to play any MMO in the first month when they, you know,

446
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,120
either launch a new expansion, launch the new game, launch free to play, whatever it

447
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,360
is, because it's just swarming with people.

448
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,040
You have to wait for it to kind of level out a little bit.

449
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:22,240
I think Star Trek online stayed pretty consistent because no one played Star Trek did, but you

450
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,960
had fans that were playing it and they were less derp than the usual derp, you know, and

451
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,880
I guess DC universe I would have hoped would have been the same, but everyone knows who

452
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
freaking Batman is.

453
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,720
But DC universe is also just a really different MMO.

454
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,880
Like it's not, wow, it's really not, wow.

455
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,840
It's more like, imagine if Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game was an MMO.

456
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,480
It's like playing city of heroes, but even worse control city of heroes is fine.

457
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,640
This way I could play Star Trek online because it played like city of heroes, which is no

458
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
problem.

459
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,240
But of course me and my Marvel love, I made a chick Hawkeye anyway.

460
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,920
I mean, her name is Hawk in Hebrew.

461
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,880
Maybe that was just your problem is you just couldn't, I've been enjoying watching Dan

462
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,800
play through, um, Arkham city Batman's Batman, you know, that, and I just think the whole

463
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,720
Batman cat woman thing is, I actually sat down and read two DC comics.

464
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Wow.

465
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,320
I read the first two issues of the new cat man, not cat man, cat woman thing, because

466
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
it had Batman lucky in it.

467
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Wow.

468
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
All right.

469
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,920
It was pretty hot too.

470
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
Anything else for your gaming week?

471
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,560
You want to share, um, Oh yeah.

472
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,020
Our type on the iPhone.

473
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,020
Really hard to control.

474
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,200
I was going to say, I mean, no, it's actually not hard to control, but like once it's like,

475
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
it's how I am with our type.

476
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,720
Anyway, once you lose those powerups, it's sort of like, Oh, what's the point?

477
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,920
I'm going to die in five seconds.

478
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,880
I am done playing classic games ported to the iPhone, but I like just listening to the

479
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
music on it.

480
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,840
I just, they all control rage too, by the way.

481
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,880
What if I played on the phone?

482
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
That's terrible.

483
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,080
I played street to rage two for free controls, terrible Sonic, terrible.

484
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,320
The Capcom arcade collection, terrible.

485
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,580
They're all terrible.

486
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,880
And it's because X-Men played pretty good.

487
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,360
Well, yeah, it's probably terrible too.

488
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,920
No, it was okay.

489
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,680
If freeze my phone, then it's terrible.

490
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,200
No, it was awesome because it was X-Men and it's prepared to die.

491
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
All right.

492
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,400
I also tried a little bit of crafted, which is the Minecraft knockoff on, um, the iPod

493
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
iPhone or whatever.

494
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
That's 2d.

495
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Yeah.

496
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,960
I, I care about that as much as I care about Minecraft.

497
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,040
That's just like, Nope, don't care.

498
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Try playing it.

499
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Sounds like Terraria.

500
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,120
I also have something else.

501
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Can I talk about it now?

502
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
What?

503
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,240
The other fun thing I've been playing with that isn't a game, but related to a game.

504
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,000
I've been playing with the well model viewer.

505
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why is that?

506
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Just because you're obsessed with wow.

507
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Well, because there's a web comic going to be coming out called called Hills Bread Blues.

508
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Keep your eyes open everybody, but I bet I've been playing.

509
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,800
Actually I spent last night while my internet was down looking through all the different

510
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,480
models and finding like the unused ones and all the derp ones and finding like what the

511
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
spawners look like.

512
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,240
So if you see a bunny, be careful.

513
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
It could spawn something.

514
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,760
They use bunnies a lot for spawning things, but yeah, it's just kind of fun.

515
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,560
I found Alfred Copperworth and I found Alexandra McQueen.

516
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,960
So I'm just laughing at the NPC names.

517
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Good times.

518
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
I think it's fun.

519
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Yeah.

520
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Let's see.

521
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Let's see what makes my games tick.

522
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Okay.

523
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,600
Um, my gaming week, I've played Warcraft as well, but I've played a heck of a lot of console

524
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
stuff too.

525
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
I want to talk about a few games I've been playing this week.

526
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,660
Um, the first I'll talk about is a game called Disney universe, which came out, um, a couple

527
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:45,080
of weeks ago and it's on, I think 360 and PS3 might be on PC as well.

528
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,400
It at first glance, it looks like a little big planet Disney game.

529
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,960
And I would say that's true to an extent, but the game itself plays more like a Lego

530
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
game.

531
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Like if you played those.

532
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,200
I saw the trailer actually for the game when it was the ghostbusters and it's, and I've,

533
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,460
I've played the game a little bit and it's, it's cute.

534
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,440
It's a basic platformer.

535
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,420
Definitely something that like younger kids and tweens would get into those folks that

536
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,080
are expecting it to be like kingdom hearts and no, it's a lot more simple.

537
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,560
But if you're into Disney like I am and you like to collect things, cause the game has

538
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,240
a lot of collectibles, especially like powering up different suits.

539
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,500
Yes, there is a Tron suit.

540
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,400
That's why, you know, I had to go with that.

541
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,880
And it was also in the trailer.

542
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah.

543
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,320
And you know, there's, there's stuff from Pixar is involved too.

544
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,560
So there's definitely a lot of stuff to just kind of absorb, but the game itself is very

545
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
basic.

546
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,400
It's definitely not the depth of little big planet.

547
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,640
And therefore you have the $60 price tag, excuse me, I think it's actually a $50 price

548
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
tag.

549
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
It's $49.99.

550
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,860
I actually got three games from the Amazon buy two, get one free sale, which are the

551
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,400
games I'm talking about tonight.

552
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,880
And so I don't really know exactly how much they all work cause I paid like a hundred

553
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
dollars for free.

554
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
It's 50 bucks retail.

555
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,920
That's still asking a bit much, this is something that I think is going to be a great deal when

556
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,660
it's on sale for 20 or 30.

557
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,980
But if you're like really hardcore into Disney, or you really just want like a basic platformer

558
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,880
for fun, something with collectibles, I think you'd be into it.

559
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,960
But if you're looking for something a little more like a game with a lot more depth, I'm

560
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,280
not so sure you're going to find it here.

561
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,800
You definitely see the inspirations from little big planet, some of the mini games and so

562
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,720
forth, which are cute, but very basic.

563
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,800
The game is not anything you haven't played before.

564
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,380
It's just with Disney looking sack boy characters, cute.

565
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,040
A game that I played a bit more of was dance central two came out this past couple of weeks.

566
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,500
And yeah, it's, it's definitely an improvement over the original.

567
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,200
Some things I noticed right away, fitness mode, it's like 10 times better.

568
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,240
They have some prearranged fitness playlist that you can play, which I was having a lot

569
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
of fun with.

570
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,280
There's a story mode kind of built into it, which encourages you to mix up the songs a

571
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280
little more too.

572
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,160
It's kind of okay to dabble into songs that are a higher difficulty on easy.

573
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,600
And I think the way the older game was structured, you really kind of felt like you had to kind

574
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,720
of go down the list of songs, but they, this one really kind of shuffles things in the

575
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,560
different modes a lot more.

576
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,000
Of course you can import all of your dance central one songs, but one thing that disappointed

577
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,600
me a little bit is that when you did that, and surely they had to know that there was

578
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,720
a lot of people that were going to do that.

579
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,280
It doesn't really integrate the dance central one stuff into the non arcade modes, like

580
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,400
the fitness mode and the, you know, well, you can do a nonstop fitness, you can do it,

581
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,480
but there aren't any like playlists that involve the dance central one stuff.

582
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,920
At least that I found now, granted, you know, if it's there, I'm sure someone in chat will

583
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,120
correct me here, but it wasn't immediately prevalent to me.

584
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,520
And I was just hoping it would be integrated maybe a little bit more, but I understand

585
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,160
they want to focus on the new stuff.

586
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:53,800
My other slight problem with dance central two is I don't think the song list is as strong

587
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,040
as the first game.

588
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,280
There's some good songs in there, but there's also some kind of really derpy songs as well.

589
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,260
Like there's a Justin Bieber song in there.

590
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,640
There's a Britney cover in there and it's like harmonics is better than covers.

591
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Like I understand that Britney is very danceable and you want a Britney song in your game,

592
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,460
but you shouldn't have to resort to covers.

593
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,920
You can get another song.

594
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,600
There's danceable songs out there that are not Britney Spears.

595
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
And you know what?

596
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,760
People probably don't care.

597
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Yeah.

598
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,160
So I mean, but there was, there were some songs that made me laugh.

599
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,840
Like there's had a ways, what is love?

600
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,000
And so it made me really laugh that that was in the game and yes, you do the head Bob is

601
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,520
part of it, but you know, that's the kind of thing you low for at parties, but you know,

602
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,720
once you've played it once, you don't really want to play that song over and over again,

603
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,580
but it did have some, it had some good songs, the dances.

604
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,380
You know what guys out there?

605
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,080
You're going to have to kind of let your inhibitions go for some of these dances because I'm all

606
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,960
I have to say, if you play born this way by lady Gaga, expect to do moves like princess

607
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,600
snaps and um, something about queen, like where you make the little crown, like she

608
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,660
does in the video, if you've ever seen the board in this way video, they kind of put

609
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,000
that dance move in there.

610
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,160
So like I can just imagine a bunch of bros playing dance central too.

611
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,480
I mean, not that that's really like the broski kind of game to be playing anyway, but let's

612
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,960
just say that, you know, it found its way out at a frat party.

613
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,520
Like if you want to impress the ladies, expect to really let your inhibitions go with some

614
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
of these dances.

615
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,880
Women like a man that's secure in his sexuality.

616
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
That's very true.

617
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
That's very true.

618
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,820
So I'm just, I'm just saying it's a lot of the dances struck me as very feminine.

619
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,160
I didn't find a lot of masculine dances, but whatever.

620
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,960
Take that as it is.

621
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Have fun.

622
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
That's all it is.

623
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,520
Have your own home, uh, the fitness modes and stuff.

624
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
It's a lot of fun.

625
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,920
And so what, if you have to do princess snaps, it's funny.

626
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,680
Um, the other game I've been playing a lot of, well, actually not a lot of, I just started

627
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,400
it today, but I really want to go home and play more of it is Arkham city.

628
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,600
Isn't it great?

629
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,920
Is really good.

630
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Yeah.

631
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,440
Um, I, you know, again, I'm only about maybe like an hour and a half into it, so I can't

632
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,760
like totally review it, but I'll just say like, usually when I leave OLR, I want to

633
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
go home and play.

634
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Wow.

635
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,040
I want to go to the city because I'm like really into it.

636
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,360
And the story, I say this, the story just get, I loved that you had like five villains

637
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,440
within the first 15 minutes, but it didn't feel, it didn't feel like overload.

638
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,260
It felt like it made sense of the story.

639
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
It was good.

640
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,520
Um, yeah, I love that it's open world now and that there's all these side quest things

641
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
you can do.

642
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,640
And it just, it's just, it's more fluid than the last one to me even like, I can't even

643
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
put my finger on it.

644
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,680
Like it's just, it's like, yeah.

645
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
And that's really rad.

646
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,160
Like that's, Oh man, I'll tell you something too.

647
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,940
As you finish certain parts of the game, you actually, um, the dialogue amongst the inmates

648
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,120
in the game will change that you overhear reflecting things that have happened in the

649
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,160
game.

650
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,280
So it's just not the same stale thing and you'll find different people in different

651
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:04,200
areas and all the Joker trophy, not Joker, the, uh, the Riddler trophies.

652
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,440
Those are hard.

653
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,160
Some of those, some of them are just cake.

654
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,560
They're right there, but some of them are really hard and, but the Catwoman switching

655
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,640
out is actually pretty neat.

656
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,680
So you'll get points that you can switch out with Catwoman.

657
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Very cool.

658
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Yeah.

659
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,800
I put in the code to get that.

660
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:26,920
So the game starts right away with a Catwoman based thing and you know, it's, it's, you're

661
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
into it.

662
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
It's, it's cool.

663
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,320
So I, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm into it into that.

664
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,200
I have to laugh.

665
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,360
There's a move with Batman that you do that you start running, you slide under a door.

666
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,440
She does the slide under the door thing, except she does it on her knees leaning back.

667
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,340
So you get this flash of boob when every time you do it in the movie where she slides under

668
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,120
a door like that or something like that.

669
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,840
Well, new movies not out yet.

670
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
We don't have returns.

671
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,960
I don't think she did that.

672
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,800
And on top of that, she didn't have the cleavage in Batman Returns.

673
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,520
I mean, Batman Returns was what, 1993 full body black suit and this is the zip up jumpsuit

674
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,960
Catwoman and like when, when cat, when that movie came out, Bane wasn't even in the Batman

675
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
universe yet.

676
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
I don't think so.

677
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,280
You know, a lot's changed since then, but, um, yeah, I, I'm, I'm having a really good

678
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,800
time with it, so I can't wait to go home and play more of it.

679
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,120
It's um, we're having a good time, so yeah.

680
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Um, slick interface too.

681
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,480
Like even right away from the menus, I was like, this is really cool.

682
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,920
And I want to play the 3D.

683
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,920
It has like 3D where it's, um, you can just use red and blue glasses or some type of,

684
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,560
I don't know, I think some other type of glasses I'm sure they're selling, but uh, yeah, you

685
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,800
can get 3D with a 2D TV, which is kind of cool.

686
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,840
It's, I have to say that the whole thing is actually a very well done package.

687
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Mm hmm.

688
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,060
Now Leo Shannon in our chat room says, yeah, but when you play Catwoman, they all refer

689
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,080
to her, to her as bitch.

690
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,800
Well, yeah, they call Batman the bat.

691
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,040
They are, well, I mean, bitch is a little bit more derogatory, but I mean, I, well,

692
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,560
whereas maybe they could use a little more variety in their derogative terms, I do get

693
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,840
the sense that they're taunting Batman as well, but I haven't played as Catwoman much

694
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,140
more than the opening sequence yet, but if they do just keep saying bitch, bitch, bitch,

695
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,060
that does seem a little bit lazy to me.

696
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,640
Pretty much, or they'll say it's the cat or Catwoman.

697
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,520
I mean, they call her by name, but they also say, I mean, the first thing, if you've got

698
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,640
a woman who's being annoying to you, what's the first thing you're going to call her?

699
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Bitch.

700
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Exactly.

701
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,800
If there's a man being annoying to me, the first thing I think to call them is bitch

702
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
too.

703
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
You know?

704
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Yeah.

705
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Maybe I'm just an equal opportunity bitcher.

706
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Call him dick.

707
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,200
But keep in mind this too, they might be calling you a bitch, but you're about ready to kick

708
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,480
their ass.

709
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,140
The one tiny negative I will say about Batman, granted I'm playing it on easy cause I really

710
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,820
just want the story.

711
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,220
It is a little bit button mashy, but it's button mashing with finesse.

712
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
If that makes sense.

713
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,560
Like it just, it's very fluid and it's cool.

714
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,860
Like it's not to the point where I find it annoying.

715
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,920
It's button mashy in the way that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game was

716
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,040
button mashy and it was still fun.

717
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,280
So that's all.

718
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,260
I was also, I have to say that I really liked the artwork that's come out with the game.

719
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,400
I'm sure on the harder modes, there's more to it than just button mashing, but I am playing

720
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
it on easy.

721
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,360
Anyway, there you go.

722
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,600
That's pretty much been my gaming week.

723
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,080
Let's talk about some housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.

724
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,320
Quickly for the live listeners, I guess we just had a bit of an outage where we went

725
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
down.

726
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
We all get kicked from IRC.

727
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,040
Dark Sakura, the house of Dark Sakura has been having some internet issues up and down.

728
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,680
So for the sake of having a clean podcast, we are going to try and just tear straight

729
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,280
through without really stopping because of downtimes.

730
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,120
So we apologize to the live listeners, but it is an issue that's out of our control.

731
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,900
Like Dark Sakura, you said your net's gone down like what, three times over the weekend

732
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,820
and affected your rating in WoW last night?

733
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,200
It's gone down off and on over the last three days and I thought that it was finally stable

734
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,320
and we got all the way through ICC ice crumbs for those who don't know and get to Arthas

735
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,600
and then it starts freezing on me and I knew it was going to go down again.

736
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,500
No porn torrents.

737
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,520
So we really thank, I've already downloaded Supernatural.

738
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,240
We really thank the live listeners for tuning in and sticking it out.

739
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
We apologize.

740
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,640
We can't fix it, but it is an issue with our internet service provider.

741
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,480
So for the sake of having a clean show, we're just going to try and push right through.

742
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,600
If we go down, we are probably aware.

743
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,280
So no need to send me 50 tells that we're down because we probably know.

744
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,600
Also, I'll say this real quick.

745
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,480
Podcast award results came out and we didn't win, which, you know, you have to prepare

746
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,080
yourself for the fact that you probably won't win.

747
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,360
The same show that won for the past couple of years, four player podcast, they won again,

748
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,960
which is, you know, good for them.

749
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,300
They work hard on what they do.

750
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,220
It's an independent show and we always said from the top, we want an indie show to win

751
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,800
and indie show did win.

752
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,040
So that's awesome.

753
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,520
And not only did they win the gaming one, they won the grande taco.

754
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
They didn't win grande taco.

755
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,320
It was something like best produced or best overall.

756
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,160
I don't know, but they, they have a big community, a strong community.

757
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,800
And so, you know, they, they had the votes getting cranked out every day.

758
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,600
The podcast awards are a little bit of a popularity contest, so it really is about kind of who's

759
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,280
got the most driven community.

760
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,480
And obviously they've got a strong community.

761
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,560
That's not me throwing shade.

762
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,280
That is they, that's great.

763
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,880
They've worked hard to build that up.

764
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,160
Not that our community is any less because you guys, we were so thankful that you guys

765
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,380
were putting out their call for retweets and posting on Facebook.

766
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,920
Other all game shows were showing support for us, which really meant a lot.

767
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,560
You guys, we saw, you know, we saw the plugs on other folks' website and the banners that

768
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,360
were like, Hey, our show is not nominated, but go vote for these guys.

769
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,840
Cause you know, we like them and you know, we're, we're on the same network.

770
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,080
And that really meant a lot.

771
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,460
And I'll also say what also meant a lot to us throughout this whole thing.

772
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:06,000
That was awesome was that over on Facebook we actually posted, you know, the other night

773
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,680
when we found out about the results, we kind of, you know, said, Hey, we didn't win, but

774
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,020
you know, it's cool.

775
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,000
At least we were nominated, you know, out of what, hundreds of gaming podcasts out there.

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,600
We were one of 10 nominated and only half of them were general gaming shows.

777
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,480
A lot of them were very specialized shows about Warcraft or other MMOs or what have

778
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800
you.

779
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,240
So that was just really awesome to even have that.

780
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,560
And the response we got on Facebook was just awesome.

781
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,700
Like we got some comments on the posts like, uh, that by the way, this is at facebook.com

782
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
slash orange lounge radio.

783
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,200
If you're not a friend, you should add us.

784
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,880
Like Terry replied and said, you won my award and that's all that matters.

785
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,800
Six plus years and still listening, uh, Fabrice commented on the post saying, I'd even say

786
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,200
you won our hearts making such a great podcast for so many years is quite an accomplishment

787
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,720
and like stuff like that is makes my heart warm for just a moment.

788
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,280
It does, but yeah, stuff like that is longer than a moment, Rob, what are you thinking?

789
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,400
So I just want to say thank you guys so much.

790
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,360
Everybody who supported us, even though we didn't win, it's all good.

791
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,120
We're still here and we don't have any plans to go anywhere.

792
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:20,160
So and so, um, that's it for housekeeping.

793
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,860
Uh, if, as I mentioned, facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, twitter, twitter.com

794
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,840
slash O L R and now the gaming news.

795
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Loki.

796
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Uh, yes.

797
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:35,360
Um, so this week was pretty big, at least for me cause Hey, they, they put out a trailer

798
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,020
for grant that out of five and that makes me happy.

799
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:44,840
So yeah, so they pretty easily guessed a sequel to grant those out of four.

800
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:51,300
Uh, now it's of course returning back to Los Santos as part of a grand theft auto San Andreas.

801
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:57,520
This time I believe those supposed to be centralized more around one city as opposed to three like

802
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,920
San Andreas was and um, mainly because you know, now they can really expand it and it

803
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
looks just amazing.

804
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,560
Of course, the rumors, you know, everyone's trying to dissect a trailer, figure out, okay,

805
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,280
what's, what's this going to be about?

806
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,560
Where are the new things in there?

807
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,260
Some of the things that you see in the trailer, um, animals, there's a dog lease in a cut

808
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
scene.

809
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,800
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to kill animals, but obviously in their last

810
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,840
game red dead redemption, there were plenty of animals running around that you could kill.

811
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,200
That would be really risky for them to do that and incur the wrath of PETA.

812
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,960
And I know you guys don't care about that stuff, but that is a bunch of like negative

813
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
publicity.

814
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
I think the game could do without.

815
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Yeah.

816
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,480
Isn't that funny that people will get more bent out of shape about killing animals than

817
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
they will killing people.

818
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,000
I would have thought that that would have happened from red dead redemption and granted

819
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,360
it's period specific, but I mean if you think about it, it's not like you're going around

820
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,640
killing people's dogs.

821
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,240
It's like, okay, they may be having, you know, police dogs coming after you or something

822
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,040
like that or there might be wolves or something in the hills and you have to defend yourself

823
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
or whatever.

824
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,120
It's just people get very possessive about their cats and dogs almost more so than they

825
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
do people.

826
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
So.

827
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Oh, the PETA people are crazy.

828
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,880
Well, I'm not, I'm not just saying PETA.

829
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,240
Like if they're going to work that stuff into the game, they better tread carefully.

830
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
That's all I'm saying.

831
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,360
It's a, it's a, it's a volatile ground they're walking with that.

832
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:20,160
Some of their stuff, um, of course, you know, planes coming back, uh, a lot more, uh, aircraft

833
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
in there.

834
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,680
Uh, a blimp is in there.

835
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,320
Who knows if you can fly a blimp, but definitely it was something that was part of the, uh,

836
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,120
you know, skyline that was kind of cool.

837
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,680
Um, very variety, you know, there's a huge variety of landscapes there, everything from

838
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,320
like the mountains to, you know, the city slums.

839
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,360
They showed kind of three different characters in there that you might be playing as.

840
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,080
One of those, the rumor to be, um, the main character from Vice City coming back.

841
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,560
Um, and then also there looks like maybe CJ from San Andreas and then a new character,

842
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,800
um, all making the return maybe to this game.

843
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,360
Uh, at least that's all rumor stuff.

844
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,600
Um, of course, multiplayer is going to be a big part of it as well and, um, no word

845
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,200
of course on any sort of, uh, release time frame.

846
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:17,240
Although if I were to be, you know, a guessing man, I'd say, uh, fourth quarter 2012, just

847
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,000
in time for the Wii U launch, it would be a good timing if they want to Grand Theft Auto

848
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
on their platform.

849
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,240
Sorry, can I say this about the pet discussion we were having a minute ago, Akuma JP in our

850
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,440
chat room says, don't worry, all dogs go to heaven.

851
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,000
It's true, it's true.

852
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,640
Cats on the other hand, no, I'm just kidding.

853
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
I love kitties.

854
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
I love all cats.

855
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Good thing Shirmi's not in here.

856
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
All cats go to special heaven.

857
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,320
She should make that face at you.

858
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,760
Cats, no, cats go to special heaven.

859
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
All right.

860
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Sorry, Loki.

861
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Yeah.

862
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,840
So, um, but yeah, it's seriously amazing.

863
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,960
If you haven't seen the trailer for whatever reason, go check it out.

864
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,240
Rockstar games.com and uh, I can't wait to play it.

865
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,880
It'll, it'll be awesome.

866
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,440
And how many times did you watch the trailer?

867
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,880
About 10, 15 times.

868
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,520
People are really dissecting even just every little frame of that kind of like a movie

869
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
trailer though.

870
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,480
There's some really stupid people out there like, Hey, look at that address that's on

871
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
there.

872
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
That means it's coming out in May.

873
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm like, no, you're stupid.

874
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm a bit frightened now.

875
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
What?

876
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,080
Her last name is wooly Bush.

877
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Stop it.

878
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
That's not related to the topic at hand.

879
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,720
I'm going to make you close that.

880
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Okay.

881
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
All right.

882
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,600
Moving on to other news that does not have to do with dark soccer.

883
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,960
Looking at the model viewer when she should be looking at her next story.

884
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,480
Uh, looked at my story.

885
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,840
What are you talking about?

886
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,960
I want to talk about this.

887
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,880
This is a game I don't think anyone in here has looked at funny enough because I don't

888
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,440
think a one, excuse me, this is not usually the type of game we play, but he wanted to

889
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
play.

890
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,040
5 million, actually 5 million to be exact people out there that are playing this game

891
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
this week.

892
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
It's battlefield three.

893
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,040
It is huge in the gaming industry.

894
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,840
5 million gamers throughout the world bought battlefield three this week.

895
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,000
That is internal estimates from EA.

896
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,840
So that could be a little bit inflated, but to be honest, I wouldn't put it past that.

897
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,600
That is actually the legit number.

898
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,760
I guess at one point they were announcing that they moved 10 million units onto shelves.

899
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,320
So this game is preparing to sell a lot more through the holiday season.

900
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,640
So yep, I know a lot of my friends were playing this game.

901
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,840
Even though I am terrible, terrible bad at first person shooters, I totally understand

902
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,880
why people are into this.

903
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,760
These games look phenomenal.

904
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,520
The graphics are outstanding.

905
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,560
And as far as the multiplayer experience goes, where you get to shoot, shoot, shoot to kill,

906
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
it's a lot of fun.

907
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,360
So, but Loki, you're trying to get this right now or what?

908
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:53,400
Well, I was looking to maybe try it, at least the single player because it looked fun.

909
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Now, I was hearing a lot of buzz on Twitter that some people are really having problems

910
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,400
with some of the origin integration and so forth.

911
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,440
And you know, the servers were having a hard time, which I guess is to be expected the

912
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,720
launch week of a game.

913
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,720
You know, the servers are always having hiccups and so forth, but it sounds like there's a

914
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,680
lot of rabble rabble about the origin integration.

915
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,740
I want to say I was reading something about a crack has already come out for the PC version.

916
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:23,680
Of course, this wouldn't affect the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 ones, but the PC one specifically,

917
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,040
I guess a crack has come out that has now disabled the origin.

918
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,720
Like you don't need it anymore, which is not a surprise at all.

919
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
I'll tell you this.

920
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,920
I didn't talk about this at the top of the show, but you guys know my Xbox was hacked

921
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
a couple months ago.

922
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,400
I got on the show, lost some money.

923
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,360
I played the demo for need for speed, the run this week, because that's a game I'm actually

924
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,960
looking forward to, but I don't play a lot of EA sports games.

925
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,180
The only EA sports games I really get into these days are the racers.

926
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,240
So the reason why I bring that up, when I logged into need for speed, the run, it told

927
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,000
me that my Xbox live gamer tag had already been tied to an email account that wasn't

928
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
mine.

929
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It belonged to somebody else.

930
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,920
In fact, I was able to Facebook that person and see what she looked like and wonder if

931
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,240
that was the person that maybe took my money.

932
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,160
Well, FIFA is an EA game.

933
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
I know.

934
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,320
I know FIFA is an EA game and this person made the account on there.

935
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,640
Now, I don't know.

936
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,600
The hacker could have just used a random email address.

937
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,600
Well they would.

938
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,840
It was interesting that I was able to look this person up on Facebook.

939
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,520
You need to confirm it though.

940
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
Like I don't know.

941
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,520
They do.

942
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,520
Yeah, you have to do three mil.

943
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,520
Well, here's what I ended up doing.

944
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:36,120
I called EA to get that unattached, to get my real EA account attached to my gamer tag

945
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,360
because I wanted my actual one on there and I wanted that one unattached.

946
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,760
I was on hold for 25 minutes waiting to speak to somebody over there.

947
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,640
But granted, I'm calling the week the battlefield three comes out.

948
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,920
So I wasn't too, you know, that's what speakerphone was invented for and you know, so I can sit

949
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,960
and play Warcraft while I'm on speakerphone.

950
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,240
But that was a little bit irritating.

951
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,440
I will say this, and yet again, somebody posted on our Orange Launch Radio wall, I feel for

952
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
you, Sky.

953
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,840
I just got hacked this week.

954
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,920
And my response was, dude, we told you change your password.

955
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,400
So people out there on Xbox, please, please change your password.

956
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,520
And this is what I'm going to honestly recommend you do.

957
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:22,100
Go download the demo for either NBA Jam or Need for Speed The Run, especially Need for

958
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Speed The Run.

959
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,320
If you like racer games like it all, like check that one out because that's actually

960
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
kind of rad.

961
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,560
The snow level is pretty awesome.

962
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:35,120
Check out the demo because when you play the demo, you can attach an EA account.

963
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,640
And I would think if you could do that in advance, it might help against the hackers.

964
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:46,240
Like I'm not sure, again, nobody knows what they're doing besides charging up these money.

965
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,020
I think they're loading up Xbox Live accounts and then trying to sell them or something.

966
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,400
So I don't know what it is they're really doing.

967
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,720
So it's hard to say what measures to take to prevent it.

968
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,240
Well, what they're doing is I think is like you can download that content to your console

969
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,040
and then you don't need that account anymore.

970
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,800
It's like kind of downloading a full version of a game, I don't know.

971
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,840
I will say this, everybody I know who got hacked, none of them play EA sports games.

972
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,520
And it's just an interesting trend I'm noticing.

973
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,440
So go get your Xbox Live account attached to an EA account.

974
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,680
I hate that I'm telling you to go sign up for an EA account because in a perfect world,

975
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,600
I would be saying, clearly there's an issue here that nobody's admitting to, which is

976
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:35,840
infuriatingly difficult, but go do it because you don't want to lose $150 like one of our

977
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,380
other listeners did this week.

978
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,920
So please, please don't be like us.

979
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,460
Change your Xbox Live password now if you haven't already.

980
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,120
And you know what, take the extra precaution and attach an EA account to it through the

981
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,360
need for speed to run demo or any EA sports demo that's out there.

982
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,880
There you go.

983
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,000
Tekniss in our chat room disagrees with me.

984
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,120
Need for speed to run looks horrible, but it uses the EA login for all their games via

985
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
origin.

986
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,600
I played it on 360, not PC, so I didn't have the whole origin thing, but I kind of liked

987
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
it.

988
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,600
It was cool.

989
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
I don't know.

990
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
But I like racing games too.

991
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
I like arcade racers like that.

992
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,900
Like I can't do Forza or Gran Turismo, but I can totally do need for speed and burnout.

993
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,080
So that's just me.

994
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,080
All right.

995
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,760
Ikuma JP asks in our chat room, is EA the hacker?

996
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,760
Who knows?

997
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,760
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

998
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,640
They do like money.

999
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,960
Let's move on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.

1000
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,360
Well, as I mentioned earlier, this is a game that I've been playing sort of as DC Universe

1001
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,640
Online.

1002
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:44,040
It's gone free to play and it's been sending the game down for maintenance off and on,

1003
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,440
which I've actually run into myself.

1004
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:54,600
But you can actually go download it through the Sega Online Entertainment launcher and

1005
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,640
the game's being revamped to handle the people.

1006
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:08,240
And also their user numbers have hit 330,000 players, which is a 600% increase.

1007
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,620
This is pretty crazy.

1008
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:15,880
Meaning that everybody went to check this game out the minute it went free to play.

1009
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Yeah.

1010
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
I mean, I was curious.

1011
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
I checked it out.

1012
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,320
I know a lot of people that did.

1013
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Don't care for it.

1014
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,240
I'm not going to play it anymore, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't have paid for it.

1015
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
I'll tell you this.

1016
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,120
I would have been really pissed if I'd been paying for it.

1017
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,400
I played it during the beta and I liked it enough where I would have played it more,

1018
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,440
but I didn't want to be paying for multiple MMOs because I think at the time I was playing

1019
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,320
the beta, I was playing for wow and something else.

1020
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,240
And I don't remember what it was, but I, yeah, I didn't want to add another one into the

1021
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,320
mix, so I didn't go through with it and I was really happy when they announced they

1022
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,760
went free to play.

1023
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,760
But then I heard the first day just that the servers are crashing left and right, which

1024
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,760
doesn't surprise me.

1025
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
So I'm going to wait.

1026
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,760
Well, the login's taking forever and it would like freeze at the loading your character

1027
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
screen.

1028
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,000
I was just like, you know what, this isn't worth it to me.

1029
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,240
I'm already paying for one game that I like and another game that I like is coming out

1030
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,240
free to play.

1031
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,240
So why am I worried?

1032
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,040
I'll still check out DC Universe.

1033
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,700
I like the idea that it's a console MMO.

1034
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:14,120
I might get it on PS3, although all my friends are on PC, just because, I don't know, I like

1035
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,920
the idea of an MMO on my console.

1036
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,920
Kind of fun.

1037
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,440
I like DC Universe well enough.

1038
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
I'll check it out now.

1039
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,840
It's free to play.

1040
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
I'm not as humbuggy.

1041
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,240
All right, let's move on with some more news.

1042
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:37,080
All right, so this is kind of sad, I guess, but Silicon Knights, they've cut their staff

1043
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:43,440
by nearly 75%, going from almost 100 people down to 25, and of course they just released

1044
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,360
X-Men Destiny, which didn't really get that great reviews, and Too Human, which really

1045
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,040
didn't get good reviews.

1046
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:59,520
So yeah, that might be a good reason why they're cutting.

1047
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,560
But yeah, apparently it has been confirmed that they had those layoffs, and although

1048
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,000
they're saying that the number is actually maybe a little bit lower than that, because

1049
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,380
they're also creating new jobs as well.

1050
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,960
So I don't know.

1051
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:26,520
It's interesting that these cuts have to happen, but I guess since they just finished the game

1052
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,080
and it didn't do that well, so they can't.

1053
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:37,200
Sadly this is kind of what happens a lot lately, which doesn't make the news any better to

1054
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
report.

1055
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,240
Yeah, I mean it's just, I'm not surprised.

1056
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,040
I thought X-Men Destiny looked all right, but apparently it seemed rushed, and maybe

1057
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:56,080
that's not necessarily the fault of them, but I kind of think it might be a little bit,

1058
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,080
or a little bit to blame, because I mean look at Too Human, a game that was delayed and

1059
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,520
delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed, and it still sucked when it came out.

1060
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,760
So I don't know if more time would have actually helped them in this case, but it probably

1061
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,700
didn't help that they were a little short in time.

1062
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,000
I guess the silver lining though is that a lot of times when these studios have these

1063
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,320
massive layoffs, the big people kind of go tend to form their own new company.

1064
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,840
Like that kind of happened with Bazaar recently, which I still cannot believe that they shut

1065
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,080
that studio down.

1066
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,040
I mean I do and I don't.

1067
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,240
Like it was horrible.

1068
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,320
But you know, they go start a new company and it might turn out okay.

1069
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,320
Another company that have some layoffs, Gameforge.

1070
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:51,000
They're kind of known for doing some browser-based games, but also they dropped their staff from

1071
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,360
450 down to 350.

1072
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,080
And of course they've recently cancelled a few different games, Mythos and Hellbreed,

1073
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,560
and I guess they're not sure if they're going to be able to finish now a, it was supposed

1074
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:10,960
to be a free-to-play or a freemium Star Trek game, Star Trek Infinite Space, that they

1075
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,360
were going to be co-publishing.

1076
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,440
I wonder if Star Trek Online going free-to-play somehow ended up being a conflict of interest

1077
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,440
with this.

1078
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,160
Just a random thought, I don't know.

1079
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Maybe.

1080
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
I don't know.

1081
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
I mean it looks kind of cool.

1082
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,480
I don't know much about it though, it's kind of the first time I've heard of it.

1083
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,880
And of course their comment is, you know, through a more efficient, organized structure

1084
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,600
we can optimize our use of resource and greater fluff, fluff, PR fluff, fluff, fluff, fluff,

1085
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,800
trying not to sound evil and terrible.

1086
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Fluff fluff.

1087
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
Yeah.

1088
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,800
Which.

1089
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,800
It's all of like, well we gotta cut costs so we're gonna have more people, or less people

1090
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,800
doing more.

1091
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,800
Yeah.

1092
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,000
I've heard that one over and over and over again.

1093
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah.

1094
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's unfortunate.

1095
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,120
Once you get down to like five jobs per person, then yeah.

1096
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,000
Let's hope these guys maybe can team up with the other ones who just got laid off and hopefully

1097
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
start a new studio that makes some awesome things that's better managed.

1098
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Let's hope.

1099
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Let's hope.

1100
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Mm-hmm.

1101
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Alright.

1102
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,960
Anyhow, moving on with some more game news that hopefully is a little less depressing.

1103
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,640
Well if you're a Sony fan this is actually pretty exciting news.

1104
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,320
The PlayStation 3 is catching up to the Xbox 360 in terms of shipments.

1105
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,520
Quarter 2, it was reported of fiscal.

1106
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,780
Fiscal Quarter 2 2011, it was reported that Sony has sold 3.7 million PS3 units around

1107
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,960
the world and that quarter ended September 30th.

1108
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:42,340
So they have sold thus far 55.5 million units and they're improving.

1109
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:48,000
Microsoft has 57.6 million shipped units worldwide.

1110
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,740
So they're getting really neck and neck.

1111
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,120
Sony could overtake this number two position depending on how the holidays and next year

1112
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,920
goes.

1113
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,880
Keep in mind we don't know if these companies are talking about what's called sell through

1114
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,800
or sell in.

1115
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,600
Sell through means all the way to the consumer at home.

1116
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,440
Sell in means just on the retail shelves.

1117
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:14,360
Either way though just I mean this news isn't that surprising just kind of looking out there

1118
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,560
on the internet at the chat that's going on.

1119
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,140
I see a lot more people seem to be picking up PS3s and not surprisingly a lot of it is

1120
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,680
the same thing that drove the PS2 sales.

1121
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,180
It's Blu-ray.

1122
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,840
Back when it was PS2 it was the DVD except the problem was Blu-ray wasn't as widely adopted

1123
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,760
when PlayStation 3 first came out as it is now and I think you get a lot of people that

1124
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,880
are buying PlayStation 3s because they're relatively cheap Blu-ray players.

1125
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,800
Not just that they're 3D Blu-ray players.

1126
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Yeah.

1127
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,720
So people that are getting these 3D TVs are buying PlayStation 3s because like hey I can

1128
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,640
play 3D movies and I can play Arkham City.

1129
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,640
You know?

1130
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,440
Honestly the games are getting better on the system.

1131
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,240
They didn't have much for a while and now they're really getting the good ones.

1132
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,840
Everybody in the gaming world gave PlayStation 3 shit when it came out.

1133
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,760
Everybody except the very hardcore Sony fans.

1134
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,280
It took them a long time but now they've made steady progress to try and get better.

1135
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,800
I still don't think everything is all roses and sunshine like PlayStation Move.

1136
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,100
Are they still trying with PlayStation Move Loki or did they finally just kind of shuffle

1137
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,100
it to the back?

1138
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,100
No they're definitely still trying.

1139
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,100
Are they?

1140
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:28,800
They've got a bunch of new games coming out and new bundles to try to drive PlayStation

1141
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Move stuff.

1142
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:36,980
I mean looking at just the month of November you've got the GoldenEye 00 edition that comes

1143
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,560
with the Move and all the Sharpshooter stuff.

1144
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,040
Which that came out last week.

1145
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,760
And then in a few weeks you've got LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition which is getting you know

1146
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,400
Move support as well.

1147
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,880
And then also they've added like a bundle that they're going to do with the Move stuff

1148
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,820
with LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition.

1149
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:03,840
There's also a bundle with sports champions at medieval moves deadman's quest.

1150
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,080
And then that game is also coming out by itself from Sony Plus.

1151
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,080
I petting friends.

1152
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,320
That is coming out as well if anyone gives a shit.

1153
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
And then.

1154
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,320
And kids.

1155
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,960
You know and they've got some new bundles and hardware stuff.

1156
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,920
Maybe I'm just kind of like poo pooing the Move.

1157
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,360
There's a lot of games that support it.

1158
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,600
Everything I see is about Kinect.

1159
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,900
And even then like this year I don't think Kinect is going to have the same impact this

1160
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,900
year.

1161
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,640
But honestly if I had a choice between playing a Kinect game and a Move game of the same

1162
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,640
game.

1163
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:45,020
I'd rather play the Move game and just it seems to be more accurate to me.

1164
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:50,920
I really kind of want to play Child of Eden on the PS3 because I think that'd be awesome.

1165
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,840
Because the Move stuff it seemed to work really well.

1166
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,440
Kinect sometimes is just kind of eh.

1167
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,240
But you know the dancing games are pretty awesome.

1168
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,960
I mean I just can't really see myself playing.

1169
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,160
It's becoming a one trick pony.

1170
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,300
It's nothing but the dancing games that are remarkable.

1171
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,300
You know.

1172
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,300
Yeah.

1173
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,300
Kinda.

1174
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,300
Kinda.

1175
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,040
And a lot of the games unfortunately I think for not so much with the Move because a lot

1176
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,320
of people are developing stuff for the Move kind of do stuff with the Wii and they've

1177
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,400
kind of gotten over that phase of hey look we make it you know where you can waggle to

1178
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,300
do different things instead of pushing a button.

1179
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,600
But how is the Kinect evolved a year later.

1180
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,640
Like what are we seeing on the Kinect now that we didn't see a year ago.

1181
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
Well.

1182
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Child of Eden.

1183
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,920
And sequel saw the shit from last year.

1184
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,320
I wouldn't even call Child of Eden that new because it's just an on rail shooter basically.

1185
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,320
Yeah but it was.

1186
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
There's plenty of those.

1187
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,840
It was a type of game we didn't have last year.

1188
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,840
But like has Kinect really changed gaming.

1189
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,960
No and even the stuff that Microsoft is touting is kind of like oh look see we're gonna integrate

1190
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,880
Kinect into these games and it's gonna be really unique and you know the head tracking

1191
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,880
and stuff like that.

1192
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,720
Okay the head tracking in Forza 4 is kinda neat.

1193
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,720
I don't know if it works really well but it's a neat idea.

1194
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:00,840
What they used it for Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition is stupid.

1195
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,040
Oh look at me I can actually use the voice command to switch between old graphics and

1196
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
new graphics.

1197
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,040
Who gives a fuck.

1198
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
I mean that is stupid.

1199
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,960
Why would I need to do that on the fly.

1200
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,760
Or why would I need to yell grenade when I can push a button and it does grenade.

1201
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,260
I mean it's dumb.

1202
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,640
So you know if they had head tracking or something like that for Halo that'd be kinda cool where

1203
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,760
you'd like you get if you move in your head it moves the camera slightly so that there's

1204
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,320
a little bit more integration there.

1205
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,720
I mean that could be really cool.

1206
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,840
I mean they're just unfortunately the head tracking stuff that they're doing like with

1207
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,400
a Forza 4 even like looking left and right that doesn't work.

1208
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,720
I mean if you're moving your head a little bit and it's tracking your head and it changes

1209
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,680
the camera's perspective based on where your head is that's kinda cool cause that's a little

1210
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,720
bit of immersion there but I don't know some of the stuff that they're doing right now

1211
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,720
is kinda useless.

1212
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,680
But yeah there's tons of dancing games.

1213
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,320
There's tons of sports games.

1214
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,600
There's you know just stuff you don't really I don't know dancing and sports games is pretty

1215
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,440
much it.

1216
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,040
Well PlayStation 3 is gaining a little ground and I gotta admit like I don't wanna blame

1217
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,240
the hack for this but I don't know what to put my finger on it with but I gotta say like

1218
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,880
all these games I've been buying lately if they exist versions on the PlayStation 3 and

1219
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,120
the 360 I've been getting them on the PS3 now.

1220
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,520
Like I used to buy the 360 versions because multiplayer was so much better on 360 and

1221
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,760
I have more people on my friends list over there but I haven't been buying a lot of multiplayer

1222
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,640
games lately and I don't play that many games online so like Arkham City I have on PS3.

1223
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,440
Disney Universe I got on PS3.

1224
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,880
Dance Central well obviously that's only an Xbox game so that's what I'm using my Xbox

1225
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:46,520
for right now but I gotta admit I can't put my finger on it but I've just been more drawn

1226
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,460
to my PS3 lately owning both.

1227
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:58,040
So this news doesn't really surprise me it's the better controller I think that weighs

1228
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,080
a lot more than you think by the way Skyrim pre-ordered on PS3.

1229
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:07,200
I do actually have to say that the PS3 controller is actually just slightly a bit more comfortable

1230
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,120
for my injured hand.

1231
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:15,000
I hate that Microsoft does not change that goddamn hideous D-pad outside of special edition

1232
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,680
bullshit that doesn't count.

1233
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,960
The D-pads alright and even the special edition stuff didn't really help but eh the controllers

1234
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
are alright.

1235
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:29,360
I mean I don't really give a crap about the or I don't really care for the convex trigger

1236
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,280
buttons that are on the Playstation 3 but who cares you know it doesn't really stop

1237
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,600
me from playing different games on these consoles.

1238
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:43,440
Really I don't play anything on the PS3 real uh you know if I'm gonna buy a game it's because

1239
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,920
well I don't really play with a lot of people on the PS3 online it's just I just don't do

1240
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,920
it.

1241
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,120
It's just too bad because I've got a lot of games that I have on the PS3 that I haven't

1242
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,120
played yet.

1243
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,280
Going to Salacious Pop in our chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com Salacious Pop says

1244
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,960
Kinect has actually turned out to be a great utility for special needs people the deaf

1245
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,880
mobility issues whatever but as a household hardcore entertainment device I don't think

1246
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,400
it really succeeded but the technology is really important in my opinion the blind not

1247
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,960
the deaf he meant to say.

1248
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,560
I get that and that's great and I do think the Kinect has made a lot of progress for

1249
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,440
like you know accessibility issues has had a lot of the iOS stuff that's come out lately

1250
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:32,200
um like Siri and all that but that's not what Microsoft's selling it as I kind of feel like

1251
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:39,280
Microsoft hasn't delivered on what they promised it to us at that's great but just because

1252
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:45,160
you know that happens to be a great perk about it doesn't mean that you know Microsoft's

1253
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:51,240
really delivered on their promise of changing gaming you know I don't know.

1254
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,760
All right anyhow I guess we'll move on to some more news Dark Sakura.

1255
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,480
Well how about something about the 3DS that might be good news?

1256
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,760
Super Mario 3D Land it's actually already out in Japan I believe and they say that it's

1257
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,280
got new firmware for the system and it's basically supposed to make your friend list more functional

1258
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:17,480
so you can join in a friend's game that's already in progress just with pressing a button

1259
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:27,280
and it's actually just a brand new firmware as opposed to the scheduled one I think.

1260
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,800
So now the 3DS is caught up to only being about six years behind in online gaming technology

1261
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
with this new firmware.

1262
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,800
Something like that.

1263
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,320
Well it's good to see them making progress forward.

1264
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:41,560
Yeah a little progress but they're not sure if it's gonna be out for the US one but they're

1265
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,640
still waiting on hearing from Nintendo.

1266
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,640
All right.

1267
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,640
I would think it would be.

1268
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:52,640
It is gonna be on the US one thanks to reviewers of the US copy already and not only does it

1269
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,640
do all that fancy stuff it of course stops.

1270
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,640
Well of course.

1271
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,640
Piracy.

1272
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,280
You betcha that Skyward Sword on the Wii when is that out by the way is that out today or

1273
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,280
is that next week?

1274
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,280
No.

1275
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,280
That's awhile.

1276
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,280
Is it?

1277
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,280
I thought it was like soon.

1278
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,280
A few more weeks.

1279
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,280
Actually I think it's Sunday.

1280
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
Two weeks from today.

1281
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,600
It's only like three weeks until Thanksgiving so it's gotta be the 20th.

1282
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:19,840
You know Skyward Sword is gonna patch up how we all hacked our Wii's to play Xenoblade.

1283
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,840
No.

1284
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,840
You don't think so?

1285
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,840
No.

1286
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,840
Really?

1287
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,840
Yeah.

1288
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,840
Why is that?

1289
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,800
Because those patches don't mean crap.

1290
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,600
The way they're getting in is not something you can patch out?

1291
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,600
No.

1292
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,240
You can take the patches off of those disks.

1293
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,140
Oh I see what you mean.

1294
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,720
So in other words.

1295
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:46,120
But if somebody who buys it and just installs it as it is might get their stuff overwritten.

1296
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,400
Well yeah I mean if you connect to even a system update stuff you're gonna get those

1297
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,080
but I don't think any of that's gonna really matter.

1298
01:05:54,080 --> 01:06:01,360
Usually they could I guess do that but I don't think that they're going to.

1299
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:06,200
In fact I'm just kind of curious here.

1300
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
Just to see.

1301
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,840
I'm wondering if Skyward Sword's already leaked out because.

1302
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:15,840
Well on top of that even if it's not like people aren't going to find another way.

1303
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,800
So I don't think it's leaked.

1304
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,480
It's just one of those things I think is interesting that's all.

1305
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,480
Yeah I mean they could.

1306
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,840
I mean that'd be a good game for them to do it on.

1307
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,320
I just to be honest though.

1308
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,320
The PSP did that a lot.

1309
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,200
To be honest with you Rob I don't think they give a shit anymore.

1310
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,960
I just think I don't think they I don't think they care.

1311
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,440
I think at this point they're like okay well we've done well I don't know we got a story

1312
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,440
coming up I don't know.

1313
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,440
I don't know Loki we'll see.

1314
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,200
I think they're already moved on to the Wii U.

1315
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,720
We'll talk more about it when we get there.

1316
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,520
I think you're wrong but we'll we'll I and I was surprised to hear it too but let's let's

1317
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,760
move on with the release dates.

1318
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,600
We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out to a store near

1319
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,560
you and as it is early November there's going to be a lot right Loki.

1320
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,560
Of course.

1321
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,840
And as I was telling you before how Activision gets behind really stupid toys toy things

1322
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,880
for the DS.

1323
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,940
We have two of them actually coming out today.

1324
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:10,720
Moshi Monsters Moshelin Zoo on Nintendo DS and Lala Loopsie.

1325
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,720
What?

1326
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,200
Yes I don't understand what they are but hey.

1327
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,760
Wasn't Lala Loopsie one of the Tinky Winky or one of the Teletubbies?

1328
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,680
No it's not Teletubby.

1329
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,680
Lala was a Teletubby.

1330
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,680
Why do I know that?

1331
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,680
Why do you know that?

1332
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,680
I don't know why I know that.

1333
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:30,640
This is my head full of random trivia but yeah so that is some weird toy that's popular

1334
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,640
nowadays.

1335
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,640
Some loop doll things.

1336
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,640
I don't know.

1337
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,640
Whatever.

1338
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,600
Anyways let's cheer for Xbox 360 and Kinect.

1339
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,040

Ultimate Card Games by Telegames on Nintendo DS.

1342
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,300
It's hilarious, a little bit of trivia here.

1343
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,720
This game is like one of the only games this company is making.

1344
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,100
It's been delayed for four years.

1345
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,100
Four years.

1346
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,600
And literally up till the last minute it keeps getting delayed.

1347
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,000
Although they claim it's actually going to release this week.

1348
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
The hell's the problem?

1349
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,160
It's just a stupid card game.

1350
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,480
I don't understand how you develop a card game for four years.

1351
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,480
It's one guy.

1352
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,120

But on the Nintendo 3DS, Driver Renegade 3D in Japan this week, as well as Jewel Pets

1465
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,320
Magic Rhythm Da Yeah!

1466
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,320
That's really the name.

1467
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,320
Da Yeah!

1468
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,640
Da Yeah!

1469
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,880
It's coming out this week.

1470
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,720
And it is, the box is about as fucking pink as a box can get.

1471
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,960
But my favorite thing about this box is that you have all these cuddly, wuddy little characters,

1472
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
right?

1473
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
But then look at this.

1474
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,160
That's an angry fucking cheetah over there on the left.

1475
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,480
Like, why are all these bitches crowding in my space?

1476
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,760
That would devilize, man.

1477
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,520
They got the creepy red eyes there.

1478
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,320
This cheetah wants nothing to do with the rest of this cute fuckery that's going on

1479
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,160
in the rest of the picture.

1480
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,000
Can you put that on the Tumblr if I link you to that?

1481
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,280
Yeah.

1482
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,760
Orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com.

1483
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,880
Well, if you don't want to, DarkSaucer, I don't know if you should do it.

1484
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:20,880
Do it!

1485
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,040
Put that on the Tumblr so listeners can see that.

1486
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,080
I love angry cheetah.

1487
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,360
Da Yeah!

1488
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,360
But cheetah's saying...

1489
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,840
The damn thing will ever pull up.

1490
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,480
Cheetah's saying Da No.

1491
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,800
Alright, on the Sony PSP, oh no, I already read PSP, derp derp.

1492
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,880
That's it this week for releases then.

1493
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,960
That's really it.

1494
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,200
The Vita to look forward to on December 17th, though, in Japan, remember, they're getting

1495
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,200
it this year.

1496
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,480
Before you get to Tumblr, how about the UK release date, StarSakura?

1497
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,640
Well, give me a second.

1498
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:03,120
Okay, on the 8th, we have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, blah.

1499
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,560
On the 9th, there's Fighting Fantasy The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, Peggle on PSP, and Premier

1500
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,920
Manager 2012.

1501
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:17,460
On the 11th, we have Cave Story 3D, LA Noire The Complete Edition, Michael Jackson Experience,

1502
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:25,000
My Self-Defense Coach, and Shinobi, Black Eyed Peas Experience, who gives a shit, Skyrim

1503
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:33,240
on 360 PC, PlayStation 3, Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012, and that's it.

1504
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,000
Now I'm gonna post stuff on angry cheetah.

1505
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Angry cheetah?

1506
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yeah.

1507
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Alright.

1508
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I'm just saying.

1509
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Alright.

1510
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Moving on.

1511
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,160
Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic game of

1512
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
the week.

1513
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,440
And again, I'll say this about the classic game of the week, it was one of those things

1514
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,320
where when I saw what it was, because, you know, I co-host the show, I get to see what

1515
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,760
it is before we start, I went, really?

1516
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,360
We've never done that one before?

1517
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:00,280
And sure enough, it's one of those games, like, this is a true fucking classic and it's

1518
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,160
not on the list of games we've done before.

1519
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
Go fig.

1520
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,240
But, a couple more news stories first.

1521
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,240
Loki?

1522
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,240
Uh, yes.

1523
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,960
So Nintendo, of course, they have a lot of patents for weird shit for the Wii and other

1524
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,080
systems.

1525
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:20,160
This one is a device that's basically a touchpad attachment and looks as stupid as it pretty

1526
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,160
much could get.

1527
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:28,080
It's basically this thing that looks like a periscope, and it would attach to the bottom

1528
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:36,400
of, or actually it looks like the top of the Wii remote, somehow, and you would, I guess,

1529
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:44,240
interact with the Wiimote's IR sensor using, it would detect where your fingers are using

1530
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:50,960
this like mirror thing, almost like using the infrared camera that's in the remote as

1531
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,360
like some sort of camera for your finger positions.

1532
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,600
So think of it like, you know, instead of looking at the infrared lights that are on

1533
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,100
the little sensor bar, it looks at your fingers.

1534
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:09,160
But it looks so stupid, like so, so very stupid, but neat, I guess?

1535
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,520
I don't really know what this would be used for.

1536
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,560
They're saying that it describes like a mouse pointer or something like that, but man, it

1537
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,560
looks so stupid!

1538
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,560
I mean, seriously.

1539
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,880
Well, but this, this, not ergonomically friendly at all.

1540
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,800
This means that something's in the works for Nintendo that isn't Wii U, or is it?

1541
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,480
I, well this, I guess, because the Wii U's gonna be the same controller, so maybe it

1542
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,480
is, who knows?

1543
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,520
It could be, but it looks like it folds down too, like so you don't have to use it all

1544
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:42,360
the time, but man, you know, that's kind of neat that you can use it as like a touchpad,

1545
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,680
but at the same time, I mean, the Wii remote navigates those menus just fine.

1546
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:51,000
I don't think we really need to add more to it.

1547
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,360
No.

1548
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:58,980
Alright, well, also speaking of the Wii, and this is what I was referring to earlier, Loki,

1549
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:04,000
when I said, I don't know, they're swearing that there's more coming for the Wii.

1550
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,820
Reggie Fils-Aime was actually on record this week saying that Zelda Skyward Sword is not

1551
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:12,180
the last great game on the Wii.

1552
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:18,160
In an interview with a Brazilian site, which was posted on the internet, he was asked the

1553
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,600
question, what's next for the Wii after Skyward Sword?

1554
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,700
And he said, more good games.

1555
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,200
Many people ask me if Zelda Skyward Sword is the last great game for the Wii, and the

1556
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,680
answer is no.

1557
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,360
Let's talk about upcoming games for the Wii in late December or early January, cough cough,

1558
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,480
after the holiday shopping season.

1559
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,480
Let's talk about that.

1560
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,480
This, okay, this could be just fucking fluff.

1561
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:45,140
Like it could be like whoopty shit Mario Tennis 27 or something, you know?

1562
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,140
Like of course.

1563
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,140
What's he gonna say?

1564
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:52,340
Sadly, we don't have any good games coming out, but we do have some great filler.

1565
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:56,920
Let's talk about, you know, thank you Reggie, let's talk about what's coming out in December

1566
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,960
and January, shall we?

1567
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,720
That's a great discussion topic right there.

1568
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,240
Let's talk about what's coming out on the Wii.

1569
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,720
We have The Adventures of Tintin, a tie-in game to an animated movie.

1570
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
No one curr.

1571
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,720
Hey, the French love Tintin.

1572
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,720
And then we have...

1573
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,720
No one curr.

1574
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:17,480
Then we have, of course, the game from Nintendo themselves, Fortune Street, basically like

1575
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,540
Mario Party, but with the Dragon Quest characters and the Mario characters in there.

1576
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,560
Not really a game that people would even be looking for.

1577
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,560
So in January, as far as I'm aware, eh, nothing.

1578
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:36,580
So I mean, I'm sure there's some games coming out or something, but not anything notable.

1579
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,580
For the Wii.

1580
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:38,960
3DS maybe, but the Wii, no.

1581
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,960
No, not even the 3DS.

1582
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,960
I don't think...

1583
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,060
Well, Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS, and then I also think that they have a version of Adventures

1584
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,060
of Tintin.

1585
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:52,240
Actually, if you give me a couple seconds here, I can tell you exactly what's coming

1586
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,240
out.

1587
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,720
1,000 to 1,000.

1588
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,800
Literally a second there.

1589
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:03,440
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I haven't bought a game on the Wii in four years.

1590
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,760
ActDeaf says, I care about Tintin.

1591
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,520
Yay for you.

1592
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,040
This is me giving a fuck for you right now.

1593
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,280
Tintin is awesome.

1594
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:18,160
TechNist in our chatroom says, it's not the last, it's the only great game.

1595
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,160
Just saying.

1596
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,160
Yeah, I mean, it's...

1597
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,560
Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

1598
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,160
I'm throwing shade at Tintin, it has nothing to do with the movie.

1599
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,200
It's just, you know the game is not going to be anything to scream about.

1600
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,200
Let's be real.

1601
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,400
How often are movie games that good, right?

1602
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,400
Thank you.

1603
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400
They're not very good.

1604
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,400
Okay.

1605
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,160
Now, Alpha Kinetogram brings up a good point.

1606
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,680
You're throwing shade at all this December and January stuff, but he said, let's meet

1607
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,760
up in December or January and then we'll talk.

1608
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:55,240
Meaning that maybe they're announcing more plans in December for what's coming in January,

1609
01:21:55,240 --> 01:22:01,600
which a lot of people are taking to mean, OMG, it's Last Story and Xenoblade and Pandora's

1610
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:08,680
Tower, which you said on this show like four months ago is what would happen.

1611
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,920
That despite the fact that they're saying, no, the games aren't coming now, they're going

1612
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,360
to come out and be America's fucking savior.

1613
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:21,800
Well, I thought they were going to do that at, you know, at like E3 or something.

1614
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:26,200
Oh, I'm sorry, 3DS also had Dr. Lorak in the Forgotten Knights.

1615
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,520
There's a Dr. Lorak game coming on 3DS?

1616
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,520
Dr. Lorak.

1617
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,520
Oh, Dr. Lorak.

1618
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,440
Dr. Lorak and the complete knockoff of Professor Layton.

1619
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:38,600
Oh, and National Geographic Challenge, my mistake.

1620
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,600
The Wii is saved.

1621
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,040
The Wii is saved.

1622
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:47,400
Speaking of release dates, Nintendo is on record that they are purposely holding back

1623
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,840
some of their upcoming 3DS games.

1624
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,940
They're going to be releasing them in 2012 because it will maximize sales.

1625
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,920
This actually makes sense though, to be honest.

1626
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,620
Like you don't want to release everything right now because then the games are all diluted

1627
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,620
or whatever.

1628
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,620
Oh, that's awesome.

1629
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:05,280
I can't wait for what other Nintendo 64 game they're going to fucking port over to the

1630
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,280
3DS.

1631
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,240
Well now hold on, hold on, because we know there's Luigi's Mansion 2, we know there's

1632
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,280
the Kid Icarus game that they showed off.

1633
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,700
Yes, Kid Icarus is coming.

1634
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:18,360
And then wasn't there another big one that they had announced that got pushed back?

1635
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,120
Who gives a crap about Luigi's Mansion?

1636
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,640
The first one was kind of, ew.

1637
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,320
I don't know, kind of looks cool, I don't know.

1638
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,320
I won't spend $30 on it.

1639
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,000
The only cool part was when you ran into the shadow that looked like it was hanging Luigi.

1640
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,760
Well maybe they've incorporated elements of Silent Hill and Luigi will be horribly murdered

1641
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,620
by some of the ghosts.

1642
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,620
Somebody can dream anyway.

1643
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:38,920
I'd pay for that.

1644
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,320
Let me read you the quote here.

1645
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,920
You want to hear something funny?

1646
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,680
There is absolutely no Wii games announced for January at this point.

1647
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,320
Alright, let me see here.

1648
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,480
For us to provide software titles one after another, one idea is, isn't it possible for

1649
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,320
Nintendo to stock some of its software titles instead of launching them as soon as the development

1650
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,540
is completed?

1651
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:04,320
Video games need to stay fresh, so it is not practical for us to put them on hold for too

1652
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,000
long, but we think that some of them may be held for a certain amount of time so that

1653
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,960
there will be a short interval between when they are completed and when they are launched.

1654
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,960
We are taking on this sort of challenge for the Nintendo 3DS.

1655
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,280
For example, when we look at the software lineup for the year-end sales season, it is

1656
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,600
so dense that if we added any more software, the total sales would not increase.

1657
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,840
Accordingly, we have intentionally delayed the launch of some software titles to early

1658
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,840
next year.

1659
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,800
Again, I'm not surprised by this.

1660
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,300
That's the strategy.

1661
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,800
Most people buy the game the week it comes out or they don't buy it at all or they buy

1662
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,800
it used.

1663
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,280
What, Loki?

1664
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,120
I'm... whatever.

1665
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:49,020
I don't see that they're gonna have any big... it's gonna be something retarded.

1666
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,020
I'm sorry.

1667
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:54,200
That they're gonna put out, you know, it's like... it's their next... their last big

1668
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,200
game.

1669
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,280
And you know what?

1670
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:00,460
It's really not gonna be their last big game because if it's really, really, really good,

1671
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,180
they're gonna fuckin' port that shit to the Wii U.

1672
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,180
True.

1673
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:07,360
Like they did with Zelda Twilight Princess.

1674
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,800
So I mean, I don't know, yeah, okay, Nintendo's got a few games coming out, but I don't think

1675
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:18,640
it's gonna be anything like, oh my god, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

1676
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,000
Still though, I gotta say, again, I've played Xenoblade, and it is pretty good, and it is

1677
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,240
ridiculous that that game is not out in the US.

1678
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,240
There's no reason it shouldn't be out here.

1679
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:31,980
There's a lot of games that they localized for Europe regions that... there was the one

1680
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:38,560
it was Disaster Day in Crisis or something like that, that came out over in Japan, and

1681
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,080
it came out over in Europe, and they completely localized it, and it was Nintendo published,

1682
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,840
and they just... nah, we're not gonna bring it over here.

1683
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,920
Let me ask this question.

1684
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,720
I don't think this is something anyone's talking about, or at least if they are, I haven't

1685
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,620
read it.

1686
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,900
With all the talk about Nintendo's losses and so forth, do you think someone's about

1687
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,840
to get ousted?

1688
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,120
Do you think that we might see that Iwata gets thrown out, or Reggie Fils-Aime?

1689
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,120
No?

1690
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,120
No.

1691
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,120
You don't think so?

1692
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:10,120
Because a lot of this stuff... some bad decisions.

1693
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:13,280
Not porting these games I think could be seen as a bad decision.

1694
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,840
The shareholders?

1695
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,280
Very pissed off that they won't make iPhone games.

1696
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,320
But here's the problem though, who gives a fuck what the shareholders want?

1697
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,320
They're stupid, okay?

1698
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,320
I mean, no!

1699
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,320
No, no, no, hold on.

1700
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,320
Loki!

1701
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,320
Do you hear what you're saying?

1702
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:30,200
I mean, seriously, they sound like stupid fucking fanboys that are like, why aren't

1703
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,520
you making Mario games for the Xbox 360?

1704
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,040
I don't like you!

1705
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:42,040
I mean, sorry, it's stupid to think that they should make games for their competitor, basically.

1706
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,720
Yes, let me help my competition.

1707
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,000
Let's give people more reasons not to buy our systems.

1708
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,520
We're gonna put our games on other systems.

1709
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,520
That's stupid.

1710
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,920
And I'm sorry that... the real answer is, though, if the Wii U sucks, Nintendo's gonna

1711
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,680
go the way of Sega.

1712
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,120
They're not gonna go the way of Sega.

1713
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,760
They're gonna lay low for a while and they're gonna come out with another system.

1714
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,320
They're gonna go the way they did with, like, the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, where it

1715
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,280
just didn't do that hot.

1716
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,640
It'll survive.

1717
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,560
People will buy it, because people eat up gimmicks.

1718
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,480
That's why Skylanders is doing alright, because people eat up gimmicks.

1719
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,640
And by doing well, I mean they've sold 20,000 copies per platform, which is not very well.

1720
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,200
But I don't know.

1721
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,040
I think, though, it's stupid if their shareholders want them to make iPhone games.

1722
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:36,320
It's not stupid that they shouldn't have, you know, some cheaper priced games on their

1723
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,380
marketplace to drive sales that way.

1724
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:43,360
And yeah, I do think they should get into a market where they have some, you know, 99

1725
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,120
cent games, because I think that's what people eat up.

1726
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,960
And they're more likely to purchase that stuff.

1727
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:55,940
Yeah the quality might not be as good as your Nintendo games, but I think that they're okay.

1728
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,940
And you know what?

1729
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,680
Some people like Angry Birds.

1730
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:02,720
Actually, a lot of people like Angry Birds and that kind of stuff, and those are 99 cent

1731
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,720
games.

1732
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,800
Or even like Fruit, you know, Fruit Ninja.

1733
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,180
Simple concept stuff that doesn't take much to develop and you sell it for a cheap price

1734
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,660
and people get addicted to that shit, and you sell tons of download content.

1735
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:20,400
But I think it's stupid for them to be expected to make iOS games.

1736
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,600
That's just dumb.

1737
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,000
But yeah, I could see them maybe coming out with some good games.

1738
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,320
I don't, honestly, the bring over, the last story and stuff like that, even though it's

1739
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,600
sometimes like, oh man, this is gonna do really well.

1740
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,240
All these hardcore fans are really into, you know, these games.

1741
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,480
I think they missed the boat.

1742
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,480
I don't know.

1743
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,360
I think that they've seen what, you know, these companies, like Mad World and stuff

1744
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,040
like that, these games that are appealing to the hardcore crowd, and they just don't

1745
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:49,160
make sense for them to bring over, because to publish them, it's just, it's expensive

1746
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,160
to bring it over here.

1747
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,660
Now, at the same time, I don't know why they've brought over some of the Dragon Quest games

1748
01:28:55,660 --> 01:29:00,100
and stuff like that, because I think those are appealing to a hardcore audience, but

1749
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,940
I don't think they sell that well, I mean, they're not selling millions of copies of

1750
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:04,940
these things.

1751
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:08,880
All right, well, we're gonna close with this thought here from our chatroom at chat.orangesonstrated.com.

1752
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,680
Kaijuto says, Nintendo has been in the game too long to fall.

1753
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,440
They'll be back.

1754
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,440
We'll see.

1755
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,440
All right.

1756
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,680
Ironically enough, we're gonna lead into the classic game of the week, which was picked

1757
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,160
before tonight's show.

1758
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,160
Just keep that in mind.

1759
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:30,960
A time when gaming life was simpler and, you know, we didn't have all this talk and podcasts

1760
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,480
that would be cynical about what the shareholders want and all that stuff for these companies.

1761
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,760
We just play games.

1762
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,700
When we were still in high school and would hide in our room and play it all day.

1763
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:46,400
So Dark Sakura, when you were in high school, what game did you go in and play all day?

1764
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,600
Super Mario World, which I was so surprised we haven't done before.

1765
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,600
I could have swore we did.

1766
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,600
I thought we did too.

1767
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:57,280
It did Super Mario World 2, which was Mario's Island, wasn't it?

1768
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,280
Yes.

1769
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,880
Which was not nearly as fun as this one.

1770
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,880
Yoshi's Island.

1771
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,880
Yoshi's Island.

1772
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,880
It was all right.

1773
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,720
It had the stupid crying baby.

1774
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,720
That was annoying.

1775
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:10,640
So yeah, Super Mario World is the game.

1776
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,640
Yay!

1777
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,560
And it was subtitled as Super Mario Brothers 4 for the Japanese release.

1778
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:21,440
I kind of love this music.

1779
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:31,360
This is my favorite music in the game.

1780
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:37,500
This game had such great music and it was all done by Koji Kondo too, did you know that?

1781
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:44,640
It was, of course, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who is the man.

1782
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:51,260
And it's basically Mario and Luigi have to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser.

1783
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:57,240
And so they go all the way across these seven worlds to save Dinosaur Land.

1784
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:02,560
And it had different power-ups in it, like the cape, and of course you still had the

1785
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,960
fire flower, and you could ride Yoshi, and Yoshi was awesome.

1786
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:12,200
So anyway, it was pretty much, you know, you had your overworld and you could go into the

1787
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:18,140
different levels, and you had your super mushroom, which is the other one I forgot to mention.

1788
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,640
And then Yoshi had all these different powers, like if you got the different colored Yoshis,

1789
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:26,640
like the purple Yoshi, if you swallowed a shell, he could just keep flying forever.

1790
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:31,760
And then if he was red, then every time he hit a shell, he would burp fire.

1791
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,800
And then there was the yellow Yoshi, wasn't it, that had the stomp, wasn't the stomp.

1792
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,800
Can I interrupt for a minute?

1793
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,800
Go for it.

1794
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,160
This game is so fucking good.

1795
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,160
I know.

1796
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,340
Like, like even just watching this YouTube right now, I'm like, oh my god, like so many

1797
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:49,600
years of my childhood playing this game are just like flowing back, like I really want

1798
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:54,240
to just stay up all night and play this fucking game, and not go to work tomorrow.

1799
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,240
Damn responsibility.

1800
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,000
I was like, I can arrange that.

1801
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,600
I know, seriously, Jamie, we need to pick a day, we need to figure out a way to stream

1802
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,200
to the interwebs from your house on the TVs and all that, and just fucking play this,

1803
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:12,560
Guardian Legend, all the fucking games we love as kids, and somehow ask people to donate

1804
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,560
and make it a charity thing.

1805
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,320
Halfway through this game, you will hear me cuss up a fucking storm because of the dirt

1806
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:26,200
level, you know, where it has the, I call it the dirt level, when it has the shifting

1807
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:31,560
sand, and you'll either get crushed to death or get caught in a wall or something and get

1808
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,920
crushed to death again.

1809
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,920
So yeah.

1810
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:41,720
So anyway, basically, you also, you go to Dinosaurland and you're on vacation and Peach

1811
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:49,920
gets kidnapped, as usual, and so they find an egg and they meet Yoshi, and they find

1812
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,560
out that evil turtles have imprisoned everybody.

1813
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,040
So basically, this, I mean, if you haven't played this game, get out from under the rock

1814
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:03,600
you've been, you know, hiding under and go freaking play it, because it's awesome.

1815
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:09,880
I love the end of it, and it's mode 7-tastic via the fight with Bowser.

1816
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:13,560
And man, there was just so much to do in this game, it was so much fun.

1817
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:18,000
I really can't get over, and there were different ways to end each level, like, you could get

1818
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,680
the key, and you would put the key in the keyhole, and the keyhole would get huge and

1819
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:30,800
then eat you, and you could climb up the bean stalks like you could in the original Super

1820
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:38,280
Mario Bros. and Mario Bros. 3, and you had the ghost houses that had the boos in them,

1821
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,280
where if you turned your back to the boo, then the boo will follow you, but if you look

1822
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,560
at him, he hides his face and he's really cute.

1823
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,440
I have a Boo Mario keychain, did I tell you that?

1824
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,560
It was just so much to do, this game is so much fun.

1825
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:56,760
So let's go ahead, though, and get to how we've seen this today.

1826
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:03,200
And on top of that, I really, I know I've mentioned the music before, but you know,

1827
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,920
Sony did the music processor for the Super Nintendo, right?

1828
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,560
Yeah, you know, the Playstation was damn near the CD-ROM for the Super Nintendo.

1829
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,560
Yeah.

1830
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:18,320
I really, I really think that this game makes the best use of the music synthesizer in the

1831
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,320
system.

1832
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,920
So, um, yeah, you also had the P blocks that would, you know, change your thing and change

1833
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,360
the type of ending that you get, all kinds of stuff, it's so much fun.

1834
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,240
And the Star Road.

1835
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,560
The Star Road was sparkly and freaking hard, because you had three different ways to beat

1836
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,040
the Star Road, too, it was crazy.

1837
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:41,200
So yeah, so re-releases, there was, um, Super Mario All-Stars came out and it had this packaged

1838
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:47,880
with it, which is basically the exact same version as what came on this mess anyway.

1839
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:54,560
Um, however, a little bit of difference in it is that Luigi had his own sprite, so that's

1840
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,560
kind of neat.

1841
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:04,880
Um, Super Mario World came out, um, on the Virtual Console as well, and, uh, it also

1842
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,440
was a demo of the game that was available as one of the masterpieces in Super Smash

1843
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,440
Bros.

1844
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,440
Brawl.

1845
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:17,240
Um, Super Mario Advance 2 Super Mario World came out and, um, it was just one player only.

1846
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:22,000
You could still use Luigi, but it was an alternate of Mario and he could jump higher than Mario

1847
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,540
but run slower.

1848
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,540
And they have voices.

1849
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:28,280
The interesting thing, too, about Mario World 2 is that even though it was, like, so different

1850
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:33,820
and on paper it sounds terrible that they made all these changes, it really stands on

1851
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:38,520
its own as another great fucking 2D game.

1852
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,520
Like it's a-

1853
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,840
It's the same game, just with a little bit of tweaks.

1854
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,760
It's an outstanding game.

1855
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,760
Yeah.

1856
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,260
Um, and they also changed Luigi's sprites to make it a little bit closer to the Mario

1857
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,640
Advance style.

1858
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:58,320
Um, like I said, Koji Kondo did the, um, music, um, and, uh, he also did all the variations

1859
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,320
on it.

1860
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:05,160
So there was, like, the Waltz version of the music that played slower in the caves, um,

1861
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,880
the underwater version, all kinds of different ones.

1862
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:14,520
And he basically, um, and, uh, when you ride on Yoshi, the soundtrack on the levels have

1863
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,520
banjo drums.

1864
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,520
Did you hear that?

1865
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:21,320
Yeah, oh yeah, you can hear it in the background right now, actually.

1866
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:26,720
Yeah, I always thought that was awesome how, like, the music changed, depending on if you

1867
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,720
were on Yoshi or not.

1868
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,160
Can I read a quick comment from our chat room?

1869
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,200
Uh, it was a Tiger Claw on chat talking about Mode 7.

1870
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,120
I remember when you fight Bowser at the end, he does that thing where he flies towards

1871
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,120
the screen.

1872
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,120
It was really cool back then.

1873
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,560
So we got an early taste of Mode 7.

1874
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,400
Oh yeah, that last boss fight was epic.

1875
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,600
Yeah, but really easy.

1876
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,600
It was really easy.

1877
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,920
But, like, you spend the whole game challenge to get there, but sort of the last boss fight

1878
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,920
is more of a relief.

1879
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:53,920
Yeah.

1880
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,160
I mean, and it's not a short fight.

1881
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,160
You just have to have good timing.

1882
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,120
It was in multiple phases, and the part where the little thing he's riding starts bouncing

1883
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:04,800
doesn't get kind of hard, but, I mean, yeah, at that point, like, if you're good enough

1884
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:11,760
in the game to get to that point, then it's, um, oh, I loved the, um, Scary House music.

1885
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,760
And I turned it up.

1886
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,240
And the fence.

1887
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,720
That was the others.

1888
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,720
Oh my god, I loved the fence stuff.

1889
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,000
And, you know, that was in all of the commercials too, remember?

1890
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,400
This game is so fucking good.

1891
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:31,720
And you could punch them in the face through the fence.

1892
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,720
That was so awesome.

1893
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,040
I loved punching them in the face.

1894
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,920
Oh god, I totally forgot about the fence parts.

1895
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,920
And then, oh, look, the flip around, flip around ones, oh my god.

1896
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,920
I know, I know, I know.

1897
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,920
Oh my god, okay.

1898
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:48,400
So, how about, um, we get into some of the other little stuff that has to do with this.

1899
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,720
How about Asshole Mario?

1900
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,720
You remember Asshole Mario?

1901
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:53,280
I remember Asshole Mario.

1902
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,760
Is there a YouTube I can pull up of that real quick?

1903
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,760
Uh, I'm sure there is.

1904
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,080
Yeah, it won't matter, because they won't see.

1905
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,800
You'll have to Tumblr it or something.

1906
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,680
Well, look up, though, one of the music Mario World.

1907
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:06,800
Because, um, or you can just keep playing, I don't care.

1908
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,800
Oh, the Thwomps.

1909
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,800
Those are awesome.

1910
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:17,960
Um, okay, so Asshole Mario is basically, um, ROM hacks of, um, Super Mario World, where

1911
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:24,520
it's not impossible, but it's freaking terrible, because you have to have perfect timing and

1912
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:32,020
be able to, to, uh, cut out a little so short, um, but you really have to be careful and

1913
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,020
have your timing perfect.

1914
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:36,040
And you keep dying over and over and over again, you just have to have a million men

1915
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,040
to get through it.

1916
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:42,240
But, yeah, if you want to see, um, an exercise in futility, look up Asshole Mario.

1917
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:47,960
And then, um, there's another one where people would basically have, this thing is like an

1918
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:55,320
autoplay, is what it was called, the Mario autoplays, where they actually have, where

1919
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:01,420
all you do is you start the level, and Mario will start walking on his own, you basically

1920
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,480
do it through means of an autoscroll level.

1921
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,080
Oh, that shit was funny.

1922
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,800
Yeah, look up, look up, um, autoplay, I think is what it is.

1923
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:17,000
But, um, he would, it would play rhythm along with whatever, uh, the music was in the background

1924
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
level.

1925
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I think this is one, isn't it?

1926
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,200
This YouTube's called Super Mario Autorun.

1927
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:26,400
Uh, it doesn't, it has some weird music in the background, though.

1928
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,400
Yeah, it's doing it to different music.

1929
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:35,400
Can you turn up just a little bit?

1930
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:49,600
Put that on the Tumblr, so people can see that.

1931
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,600
I will.

1932
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,280
Yeah, that's the first one I ever saw.

1933
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:55,300
By the way, that's what we're using Tumblr for now, is that all these little things we

1934
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:59,280
see during the show, that way you podcast-y listeners can go back and have it all in one

1935
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,280
place.

1936
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:06,040
Yeah, but basically they'll take music and they'll set the game autoplaying to all of

1937
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:11,760
this stuff, and just the amount of time and thought and rhythm that goes into this is

1938
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,880
just absolutely baffling.

1939
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,800
These people have no lives, but it's really cool.

1940
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:20,080
S.S.J. 100 Matt linked to Asshole Mario in the chat room, so I just want to remember

1941
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,040
how fucking terrible this is.

1942
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,840
Um, Asshole Mario.

1943
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:30,240
It's like you just start to feel sorry for these people after a while, because it's like,

1944
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:36,280
oh my, you could, I swear, there's been times when I've watched those and I just want to

1945
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,840
go, oh, I'm so sorry, oh, I'm so sorry, and then feel like crying because you can feel

1946
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,160
like it's happening to you.

1947
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:46,000
No, I'm laughing, because this stage just starts out right off the bat, Bullet Bill

1948
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,160
in your face.

1949
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,760
If you're not ready for it, it's going to get you.

1950
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,080
That's awesome.

1951
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,520
It's crazy.

1952
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,080
Anything else that you were going to say about this?

1953
01:40:56,080 --> 01:41:00,320
No, it's just that Super Mario World is awesome, and it's clearly created such a legacy, you

1954
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,320
know?

1955
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,320
Oh yeah.

1956
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:06,960
So, I'd say it's well worthy of being our Classic Game of the Week.

1957
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,040
If Mario 3D World is half as good as Super Mario World, it'll be a great purchase.

1958
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,040
For real.

1959
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,040
So.

1960
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:18,760
Alright, your Classic Game of the Week, Super Mario World, a true, true, true classic.

1961
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:24,720
I mean, the classic, and just shocked as hell that that has never come up before, so what

1962
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:25,720
a find.

1963
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:29,480
Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go

1964
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,480
anywhere.

1965
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,480
We're not done yet.

1966
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,480
There's still half a show to come.

1967
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,120
We've got plenty of news to talk about still.

1968
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,960
Your emails are coming up, the FUs of the Week, your Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash

1969
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:43,060
O-L-R. Much more news in the second half of the show, including, I find this crazy, which

1970
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:47,000
PopCap game might they be making an arcade machine out of?

1971
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,880
That could be something else, huh?

1972
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,040
Rapid Fire News and all that fun stuff when we come back after a quick break with more

1973
01:41:53,040 --> 01:42:00,280
of Orange Launch Radio.

1974
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,760
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio.

1975
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,040
We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 6th of 2011, with the second half of episode

1976
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:15,800
number 434 live tonight, as we are every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1977
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,680
We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

1978
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:20,680
show.

1979
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,680
We love Bobby.

1980
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:26,480
He's one guy doing an NPR-ish style show, where he talks about games and has live call-ins

1981
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,480
as well and so forth.

1982
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,480
And one thing he was talking about-

1983
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,480
Except without being boring.

1984
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,480
Yeah, he's not boring.

1985
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,480
Yeah, he's not.

1986
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,480
Not at all.

1987
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,440
It's like one of those like really thrilling NPR shows, like Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me

1988
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,440
or something like that.

1989
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:37,440
Does it exist?

1990
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,440
Yes.

1991
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,440
Okay.

1992
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,440
They have some fun podcasts.

1993
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:41,440
You should check it out.

1994
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,280
But anyway, one thing that Bobby was talking about on his show tonight that I guess it's

1995
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,680
coming up a little later in our show, so I apologize.

1996
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:50,320
I'm stepping on it a little bit, but maybe Loki can find another story to fill in for

1997
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,320
it, because I want to talk about this.

1998
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,680
And that's the Mass Effect 3 beta that came out.

1999
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:58,320
And I guess some things are being reported out of that whole Mass Effect 3 beta, that

2000
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:03,160
there's going to be new modes in the game, that there's not just going to be like a normal

2001
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,160
mode, right?

2002
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,280
But that there'll be a mode in the game that focuses more on the combat features, and then

2003
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:12,820
a mode that focuses more on the RPG and dialogue features.

2004
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:18,040
And I got to admit, I'm not usually a Mass Effect fan, but I find that shit really exciting.

2005
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:24,360
Like you know, combat's okay, but I'm way more into the story elements and all of that.

2006
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:28,880
So if there's like an RPG only mode, like I'm really excited about that.

2007
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,080
Loki, do you think that's good for the game, for the series or what?

2008
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,080
Sure.

2009
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,200
Probably won't pick it up anyways.

2010
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,680
You get it anyways, just because?

2011
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,840
No, I will not get it.

2012
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:39,840
Oh, you're not going to get it.

2013
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,840
Why not?

2014
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,840
You're just not a fan of Mass Effect?

2015
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,160
I'm not either, but I find that really interesting.

2016
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:50,360
I mean, and to be honest, I'm not hating because I think the games are bad, it's just again,

2017
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:54,800
there's only so many games that a person can play at a time, and I just never got into

2018
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,680
Mass Effect 1 or 2 as much as other people love them.

2019
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:01,520
I watched somebody play 1 and I was kind of like, it doesn't really look like something

2020
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,520
I'd be into.

2021
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:06,180
And I mean, I don't know, I've enjoyed other Bioware games, I've played like Dragon Age,

2022
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:08,180
so who knows?

2023
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:12,560
Alright, well let's get into some rapid fire news.

2024
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,360
We're going to cover some news stories really quickly because there was quite a bit of news

2025
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,360
this week.

2026
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,360
It is a busy time of year.

2027
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,360
Loki, we'll start with you.

2028
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:25,760
Capcom believes that Resident Evil Revelations is going to be worth $50, and that's $10 more

2029
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:33,280
than your regular 3DS game, in fact even Nintendo games like Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart

2030
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,100
7 are only going to be $40.

2031
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:43,960
But Capcom thinks, hey you know what, Resident Evil Revelations should be $50.

2032
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:48,080
And it will support the circle pad, which will be coming out of here later on.

2033
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,000
For another $20.

2034
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:57,200
And they were quick to point out, yes you can reset your save game this time.

2035
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:01,680
Oh well thank you Capcom, thank you so much, that was very gracious of you to let us do

2036
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,680
that.

2037
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:05,000
It's amazing why they need the extra $10.

2038
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,680
A true console experience on a handheld device is what Resident Evil Revelations is.

2039
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:17,920
It's also going to be, it requires a 4GB cartridge resulting in a higher price point.

2040
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,200
Yes because those extra, you know, gigabytes are more expensive.

2041
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:28,080
You know, I don't know what cartridges cost, but I know when it comes to flash memory,

2042
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:36,960
an extra 4GB on flash memory, 4 versus 8, like a few bucks, a couple dollars.

2043
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,120
Flash memory is really cheap, Capcom, I'm not buying it.

2044
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,120
Really I'm not buying it.

2045
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:45,680
I'm not going to buy your game at all.

2046
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,760
So, meh.

2047
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,720
And of course if you're interested, it comes out in February.

2048
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:57,800
Of course there's going to be a new Rainbow Six game coming from Ubisoft I'm sure.

2049
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:04,680
Miles is probably a ways away, but Rainbow Six Patriots, outed by the new Game Informer

2050
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:13,120
cover, is going to be kind of a game that deals with, you know, terrorism set in our

2051
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:19,480
own country, and kind of like home grown terrorists I guess.

2052
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:31,560
No real details, but obviously they're saying there's a lot of splits in, a lot of, the

2053
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:38,320
word's escaping me now, basically a lot of different narrative directions, they said.

2054
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:45,640
Tactics and realism, they kind of go in the whole double, was it the last conviction route

2055
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:51,920
I guess, the Splinter Cell game, more realistic and gritty, versus the last Rainbow Six game

2056
01:46:51,920 --> 01:47:00,160
was Vegas, a little kind of over the top I think, but they still, I don't think it's

2057
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:05,080
coming out any time soon, maybe the fall, because we still have Ghost Recon Future Soldier

2058
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,200
which is supposed to be coming out, and I don't think you'd want to compute two Tom

2059
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:14,440
Clancy games, but yeah I can see that coming out maybe, yeah they're saying 2013, so that's

2060
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:19,920
still a ways away, but it looks pretty cool, I never really played any of the Rainbow Six

2061
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,960
games, I did play a lot of Ghost Recon stuff, so it should be interesting to have to check

2062
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,960
it out I guess.

2063
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:31,800
I think Dan played a little bit of that and he liked it, Rainbow Six, the last one.

2064
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:36,080
And not surprisingly, with all the Kinect hacks out there, Microsoft is actually thinking

2065
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:42,680
about marketing Kinect for PC, and Kinect for Windows is going to be the new marketing

2066
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:48,760
campaign I guess, they're actually going to be doing, it's an official website, where

2067
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:54,840
developers can download newly released beta 2 software development kits, and allow people

2068
01:47:54,840 --> 01:48:01,880
to make different software and apps that will use the Kinect camera, and you know it might

2069
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:05,320
be interesting, maybe someday, and I'm not sure if this is going to be something that's

2070
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:11,040
in Windows 8, but maybe they're going to have a lot more integration with PCs with the Kinect,

2071
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:15,360
maybe even so far as building in a Kinect camera into a laptop or something like that.

2072
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,080
I could see that happening actually, I don't know why, but the Kinect at close range, that's

2073
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,120
the only thing, who plays the PC from far away?

2074
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:29,440
I understand that, but maybe they could adapt the Kinect camera to have it like, okay, there's

2075
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:34,340
going to be one that's like, I'm sitting in front of my laptop, versus I'm sitting 8 feet

2076
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:35,340
away from my laptop.

2077
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,340
Yeah, true.

2078
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:41,200
And for some of the accessibility reasons that SalaciousPop had brought up in a chat

2079
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:45,660
comment earlier, I could see where Kinect getting built into the PCs would be more useful

2080
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:50,480
than like, what we think of in our minds right now when we think of Kinect, like Dance Central.

2081
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,480
You know?

2082
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,480
Yeah.

2083
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,480
Yeah.

2084
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,480
So.

2085
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,480
It'd be neat.

2086
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,800
Especially some of the voice commands and things like that, especially with some of

2087
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:03,040
the early stuff of Windows 8, where you see that it's going to have a mode that's very

2088
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:06,480
dashboard-like or tablet-like, I'm sure you've all seen that.

2089
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,480
Yeah.

2090
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:09,120
Gonna be interesting.

2091
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:10,560
So the Kinect could control that.

2092
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,800
Well, I can see, yeah, definitely, because the Kinect controls that already in the new

2093
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,720
dashboard, so they could just adapt it exactly the same way.

2094
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,720
True.

2095
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:26,620
Moving on to some other stories here, Techland has trademarked Dead World.

2096
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:27,620
Why is this important?

2097
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:29,780
Because they're the folks that made Dead Island.

2098
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:34,760
So immediately we're all thinking, hmm, maybe there will be a sequel to the game that just

2099
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:37,440
came out recently that did pretty well.

2100
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,080
Did pretty well, came out at a good time, and a lot of people were into this, so going

2101
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:44,400
from island to the whole damn world makes a lot of sense.

2102
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,600
So we'll see more on that, probably at E3 next year, if it ends up that it's legit.

2103
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,000
Or maybe they're just trademarking it, just in case.

2104
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,800
You never know, but usually these things end up being the game.

2105
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:57,120
Yeah, I would imagine that they're making a sequel to a popular game.

2106
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:00,840
Walmart's getting its own game magazine, which, you know, game magazines do pretty well for

2107
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,640
stores if GameStop is any indication.

2108
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:09,440
But what's interesting is that the folks behind it is going to be EGM Media, of course, Electronic

2109
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,880
Gaming Monthly.

2110
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,600
The new magazine will be called Walmart Game Center.

2111
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:17,920
They're not saying it's going to be monthly, they just say, quote, regular frequency.

2112
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,920
So maybe that's just, you know, monthly during the busy periods and twice, you know, every

2113
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,480
other month or whatever during the not so busy periods, who knows.

2114
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:30,840
It's going to have news, previews, interviews, and other exclusive stories on gaming culture

2115
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,320
and the most important game releases.

2116
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,800
In other words, pretty much the same shit you can get on the internet right away.

2117
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:38,080
So it's making it very difficult for magazines right now.

2118
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:45,820
But if they can get the good exclusives and takes on gaming culture, certainly it could

2119
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:47,600
give GameStop some competition.

2120
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:53,320
And although I'm not a big Walmart fan either, I'm all for giving GameStop a little competition.

2121
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:58,320
They are going to offer this on personal computers, iPad, and Facebook with what's called the

2122
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,720
Screen Paper Publishing Platform.

2123
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,200
I guess that's a proprietary thing to EGM.

2124
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:09,800
Very interesting to me that it's not on the iPod or iOS, iPad magazine thing they have

2125
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,880
now because you can get Retro Gamer now on your iPhone.

2126
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:12,880
Did you know that?

2127
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,040
It's all part of that newsstand thing that came out in the new iOS.

2128
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:20,140
Granted, you have to pay five bucks an issue or whatever it costs normally on the newsstand.

2129
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:24,680
But it is, you know, they got to adapt and get with the times and a lot of people are

2130
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,240
doing reading on their iPods and iPads.

2131
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:29,280
They're going to adapt and get with the times, maybe lower that price point.

2132
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,280
Yeah, that would probably be a good idea too.

2133
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:35,800
But you know, I guess maybe Dark Sacred could tell you it takes a lot of work to put those

2134
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,040
magazines together.

2135
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,860
I could totally tell you that.

2136
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,440
Now I think this is funny.

2137
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,200
This is a very tongue-in-cheek, very sort of game.

2138
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:51,520
It's an indie game that just came out on Xbox Live Indie Games and the indie game developer

2139
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,320
is Ben Kane.

2140
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:58,520
It's called DLC Quest and I love this trailer so I'm going to play a little bit for you

2141
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,520
guys.

2142
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:01,420
Maybe we'll get it on the Tumblr too.

2143
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:04,920
Going Loud Studios put this out and here's the trailer.

2144
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:11,000
What happens when DLC goes too far?

2145
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
DLC Quest.

2146
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,200
The basic features are now DLC.

2147
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
Pausing the game?

2148
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,200
DLC Quest.

2149
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,200
Animation?

2150
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:22,200
DLC Quest.

2151
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
Moving to the left.

2152
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,200
Well, that's included.

2153
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,200
No, it's not.

2154
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,200
DLC Quest.

2155
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,440
Collect coins and buy DLC.

2156
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,440
It's simple.

2157
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,400
DLC means downloadable content and Quest means Quest.

2158
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
DLC Quest.

2159
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:50,400
We got map packs, night map packs, sexy outfits, hats, and zombies.

2160
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,400
Yeah, we even got horse armor.

2161
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,400
DLC Quest.

2162
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,400
I think there's a princess or something to rescue too.

2163
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,400
I don't know.

2164
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,400
**** you.

2165
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,400
DLC Quest is made with satire.

2166
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:09,400
Satire means the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ritual to expose and criticize people's

2167
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:10,400
stupidity.

2168
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,400
DLC Quest.

2169
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:12,400
Download it now.

2170
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,400
See, now, I thought that was funny.

2171
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:18,400
That was funny.

2172
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,400
Here's the thing.

2173
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:23,400
The satire part is, and what you can't see unless you're actually looking at the video,

2174
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:27,400
is that the guy is walking around collecting coins in a very Mario-esque kind of game,

2175
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:31,900
so the quote-unquote DLC is that you're using these coins you pick up to get the ability

2176
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:36,400
to move to the left and get sexy princess outfits and horse armor and all this stuff.

2177
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
I think that's funny and it is pretty good satire.

2178
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,400
What did you think of that, Loki?

2179
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,400
I don't know if you've seen that before.

2180
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,400
What?

2181
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,400
It's pretty funny.

2182
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,400
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

2183
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,400
So, I don't know how much that costs.

2184
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,400
I didn't see...

2185
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,400
Oh!

2186
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,400
80 Microsoft points.

2187
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,400
A buck.

2188
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,400
Good for you, dude.

2189
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,400
A whole dollar.

2190
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,400
I think you'll sell some copies with that.

2191
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,400
Why not?

2192
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,400
Why not?

2193
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:56,400
Good for you, dude.

2194
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,400
All right.

2195
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,400
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

2196
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,400
A couple things.

2197
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:05,400
Actually, new Xbox Live Arcade game is Alan Wake.

2198
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:11,400
It's going to be available for Xbox Live Arcade and it was announced on their Facebook page.

2199
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,400
It's not a sequel.

2200
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,400
It is the game.

2201
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:21,400
Also, there is a country music pack for Rock Band 3 that's got a lot of crap in it.

2202
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:24,400
And I mean crap because I hate country music.

2203
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:27,400
It's called Going Country Pack 5.

2204
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,400
It's Shelly Wright.

2205
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,400
Yeah, but couldn't you call stuff like Sweet Home Alabama country music?

2206
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:32,400
No, Southern Rock.

2207
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,400
There's a difference.

2208
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:35,400
Sorry, my bad.

2209
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,400
There's some decent stuff in here.

2210
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:41,400
The night the lights went out of Georgia is Reba.

2211
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,400
There's Sugarland.

2212
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,400
There's also Going Country Pack 6.

2213
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,400
That's Billy Currington, whoever the crap that is.

2214
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,400
George Strait.

2215
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:54,400
I mean, hey, Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire, Justin Moore, who cares?

2216
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,400
Going Country Pack 7.

2217
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:56,400
Dude, Johnny Cash.

2218
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,400
Keith Urban.

2219
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:59,400
Hey, Lady Antebellum.

2220
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,400
Merle Haggard.

2221
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,400
Now, Merle Haggard's pretty awesome.

2222
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:06,400
And Going Country Pack 8 has Dwight Yoakam and Rascal Flatts.

2223
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,400
Going Country Mega Pack, all of the above, and all the other stuff I didn't say, and

2224
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,400
it's 20 bucks.

2225
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:16,400
It almost makes you think that at some point they were gonna do a country rock band release

2226
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,400
and didn't end up doing it because they had like all these songs.

2227
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,400
This is a lot from getting it once.

2228
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,400
They did two country rock band track packs.

2229
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,400
Yeah, they did the track packs a while ago.

2230
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,400
I guess maybe this is just a virtual version of that.

2231
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:26,400
I don't know.

2232
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,400
The only one of those that I care about is Johnny Cash because Ring of Fire is awesome.

2233
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:33,400
Yeah, Johnny Cash, he's above country music.

2234
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,400
He's godly music.

2235
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,400
And then, you know, Ring of Fire was in the Silent Hill movie.

2236
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,400
Yeah, but still, Ring of Fire is just a great song.

2237
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,400
I'm giving it another...

2238
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,400
I see, a little video game connection.

2239
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,400
I'm wearing my Silent Hill shirt.

2240
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,400
You are.

2241
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,400
You are.

2242
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,400
Pyramid Head is attacking your boobies on that shirt.

2243
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,400
I've enjoyed it all day.

2244
01:55:53,400 --> 01:56:03,400
And speaking of Silent Hill, there actually is talk that Silent Hill may be going off into different spin-offs.

2245
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:14,400
I haven't really said exactly what, but there's been mentions of maybe an RPG or a first-person shooter.

2246
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,400
They did have that arcade game that was kind of a shooter, wasn't it?

2247
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:19,400
Yeah, and it was the iPhone game.

2248
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,400
I wish the iPhone game was pretty awful, but it was an early game.

2249
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,400
I wish they would port that arcade game to, like, Xbox Live Arcade or something.

2250
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:32,400
They also said that Downpour, though, was never going to be a first-person shooter.

2251
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:41,400
The quote is, and this is coming from, let's see, Tom Hewlett, who's a senior associate producer on Silent Hill, Downpour.

2252
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,400
It says, Downpour was never going to be an FPS.

2253
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:48,400
This is just the result of some overzealous fans reading too much into a posting on Vatra's website.

2254
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:51,400
How about make Silent Hill cool again?

2255
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:56,400
Seriously. For Sakuriyamoka to come back. Throw a lot, a lot, a lot of money at him.

2256
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,400
That's what you could do.

2257
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,400
And grovel. Groveling helps.

2258
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,400
Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangehunter.com.

2259
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:06,400
A lot on the country pack, the dark soccer I mentioned a minute ago.

2260
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,400
Brad from Pod Culture says, when is this country pack due out, or did I miss it?

2261
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,400
Did you save the date?

2262
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,400
No, I didn't.

2263
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,400
It's this upcoming week, right?

2264
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,400
Yeah, I think so.

2265
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:21,400
So, that'll be out very, very soon. It's not like something like Way in the Future.

2266
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:24,400
It is, I just pulled it up. November 8th is when this is all out.

2267
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:29,400
Going to other comments, Legend of Zaku says, needs more achy breaky heart.

2268
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,400
Please no.

2269
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,400
Unless we have the Weird Al version. We need a Weird Al pack.

2270
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,400
That would be awesome, actually.

2271
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:38,400
He's gonna be in Oakland in a couple days, or maybe it was tonight.

2272
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,400
Ugh, damn.

2273
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,400
If there's no writing going on or all that.

2274
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:49,400
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, going country? Will there be other genres, like going dance, going rave?

2275
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:55,400
Well, as neat as that idea is, keep in mind, it is gonna have to make use of all the instruments somehow.

2276
01:57:55,400 --> 01:58:04,400
Now, there are some songs that will exclude a keyboard or a bass, but keep in mind, it's gonna be really hard to do a dance pack.

2277
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,400
Unless it has guitars.

2278
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:12,400
But like, they could do like CNC Music Factory, Everybody Dance Now, because it had that...

2279
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:16,400
I guess they could probably get creative and figure something out. We'll see.

2280
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:27,400
Alright, let's move on to some more news before we get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week, and your calls pretty soon here.

2281
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,400
Loki.

2282
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:38,400
Yes. Now, one of the features of the Playstation 3 has been to allow people the ability to share content.

2283
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:44,400
Or at least you can link your content that you download to up to five different PS3s.

2284
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,400
I would imagine that's if, for example, you own multiple PS3s.

2285
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:56,400
Or, for example, if you have a PS3 that dies and you wanna bring that content to the new PS3.

2286
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,400
And they figure that you're not probably gonna go through five PS3s.

2287
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:01,400
Well, people have been using that to share games.

2288
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:05,400
So say, for example, I download a game and I can share it with four of my friends.

2289
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:10,400
Because they all download it to their console using that sharing feature.

2290
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,400
Kind of exploiting it, if you will.

2291
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:22,400
Well, beginning on November 18th, Playstation Network licenses can only be tied to two PS3s and two PSPs.

2292
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:28,400
Apparently, they're saying that that's gonna affect purchases made after the start date.

2293
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:38,400
And while you'll be able to deactivate and reactivate consoles online, the days of sharing with a bunch of people is now gone.

2294
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:42,400
And so, honestly, I think that's fair.

2295
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:46,400
I mean, because people were kind of abusing it to begin with to get free games.

2296
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:55,400
And if you can deactivate consoles, like say, for example, your console dies or whatever, and you can reactivate it on a new console, I think that's fair enough.

2297
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:59,400
So, yeah. Go Sony.

2298
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:02,400
I'm kinda not surprised. They're clamping down on it.

2299
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:10,400
Five did seem excessive and they're probably privy to all these people that have formed these little clubs about sharing the codes and so forth, or sharing the content.

2300
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,400
So, I'm not too surprised.

2301
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:17,400
Two seems reasonable. One downstairs, one upstairs, or one in the bedroom, one in the living room.

2302
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:21,400
Well, and the fact that you can deactivate them, too. I don't know if you could deactivate the ones when it's five.

2303
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,400
Oh, good point.

2304
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:25,400
So, that would be... I think that's fair.

2305
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,400
That would be good if you fry one PS3 and you have to get another one.

2306
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:32,400
You can add it onto that and you can deactivate it once you get the new one.

2307
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:33,400
Very true.

2308
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:37,400
So, that's good. And not too surprising that they've clamped down on that.

2309
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:43,400
But again, that's not retroactive, right? So, any old games you've already bought are under the five license.

2310
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,400
That's right.

2311
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:48,400
So, the clubs aren't really getting shut down. It's just, you know, you're not gonna be able to do it much longer.

2312
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,400
Yeah.

2313
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:56,400
Well, here's one of the games that you won't be sharing with five different people, which is too bad because it's gonna be a pretty big party game.

2314
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:00,400
Now, if you've ever played this card game at a party, you know how much fun it can be.

2315
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,400
Apples to apples. Have you ever played this?

2316
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:03,400
Love it.

2317
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:10,400
Yes. This is the game where you have a card on a green card and the green card is some type of, like, verb.

2318
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,400
Like, I don't know, like...

2319
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,400
It's usually an adjective, I think.

2320
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,400
Yeah, like an adjective. Like...

2321
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,400
Tasty.

2322
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:22,400
Yeah, tasty. And then the red cards all have, like, nouns on them. Like, the 90s.

2323
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:26,400
Or the card that will always win every round, including, like, tasty.

2324
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:29,400
You put down Helen Keller. Always wins the round, right?

2325
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:33,400
And then, because everybody votes on which card is the funniest for that.

2326
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:40,400
Well, this game is going to be coming out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this holiday season.

2327
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,400
I'm gonna play the shit out of this.

2328
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,400
CHQ is doing it and apparently they're gonna be adding this social and online connectivity.

2329
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:51,400
You're gonna be able to play this anywhere, anytime.

2330
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:58,400
It's gonna be interesting to see how it works because, you know, it's not gonna be the same online that it is in person, but...

2331
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:03,400
Or that it is drunk on pineapple malibu in the hotel room.

2332
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,400
There will be single, local, and six player online play.

2333
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,400
You're gonna have golden apple cards.

2334
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,400
How do you play single player?

2335
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,400
It's kinda dumb, huh?

2336
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:15,400
Golden apple cards, which will be used to change the rules.

2337
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:18,400
There's gonna be Facebook support as well.

2338
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:22,400
Download content. Of course, more cards and all the same stuff you saw in Uno.

2339
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:26,400
800 Microsoft Points, $9.99 on PlayStation 3.

2340
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:29,400
And the game will be expanding to Facebook and so forth later on.

2341
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:32,400
It's one of those things where, like, God, I love the party game.

2342
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:37,400
But online, like, if I'm not playing with friends, I don't know how this is gonna be much fun.

2343
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,400
Like, with strangers, it's gonna be stupid.

2344
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,400
You know what I mean?

2345
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,400
You know what would be awesome?

2346
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:43,400
What?

2347
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,400
Uh, what was it?

2348
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,400
Eat Poop, You Cat.

2349
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:50,400
Oh, yeah, God. Explain that game real quick.

2350
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,400
That's a fun game.

2351
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:58,400
Eat Poop, You Cat is basically, uh, visual telephone, I guess.

2352
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:02,400
You start off by writing a phrase, and you pass it to the next person.

2353
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:07,400
They draw a picture of that phrase, and then you basically obscure the original phrase,

2354
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:11,400
and the next person tries, they write a phrase based on what the drawing is,

2355
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:16,400
and it keeps on going from there with, you know, more drawings and phrases and so forth.

2356
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,400
Until you get to the end, you're like, what the hell?

2357
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,400
It's really obscure.

2358
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:23,400
It's a really fun party game, and it's pen and paper.

2359
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:24,400
You don't need anything else.

2360
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,400
It's great.

2361
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:27,400
Yes, but it'd be awesome to see.

2362
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,400
It turned dirty so fast.

2363
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,400
You have to do it on the DS or something where you can draw.

2364
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,400
But, uh, yeah, apples to apples will be interesting.

2365
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,400
It would be cool, like, and if this is what they're talking about, I'm not sure,

2366
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:42,400
but, like, if the Xbox can play Facebook, that might be interesting,

2367
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:45,400
because it'll make it way more likely that you could actually play your friends,

2368
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:48,400
but I'm not, I don't know, I'm not giving them that much credit.

2369
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,400
That seems kind of complicated.

2370
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,400
But it would be really cool if they could get that to work somehow.

2371
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:55,400
So, there you go.

2372
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:57,400
Apples to apples coming soon.

2373
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,400
Let's, uh, go to our mailbag.

2374
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:04,400
Every week you guys send us e-mails, and Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag

2375
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,400
and reads them.

2376
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:09,400
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us e-mails.

2377
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,400
We got a few.

2378
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,400
All right, good, because we were off a week.

2379
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,400
A few.

2380
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:17,400
So, first off, hey guys, Molten Brown here.

2381
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:21,400
I heard you talking about rugby games last week, and I felt I had to chime in.

2382
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:25,400
I've been playing rugby for six years now, and it is awesome.

2383
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:29,400
I am really happy with the increase in rugby games this year,

2384
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,400
considering how popular this sport is worldwide.

2385
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:37,400
Regarding the increase, I may be because the Rugby World Cup is going on right now.

2386
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:40,400
I would say more, but I'm not feeling well, so I'm just going to peace out.

2387
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,400
Later, Molten Brown.

2388
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:43,400
Aw, feel better.

2389
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:45,400
I mean, rugby is awesome, don't get me wrong,

2390
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:47,400
but you got to admit, it is a little weird.

2391
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:48,400
Like, rugby doesn't quite get –

2392
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,400
Violent.

2393
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:52,400
It's an ESPN2 sport, let's put it that way.

2394
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:53,400
I'm not knocking it.

2395
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:54,400
It's awesome.

2396
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,400
It's just, you know, not –

2397
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,400
Only in America is it an ESPN2 sport.

2398
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,400
That's true.

2399
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,400
That's very true.

2400
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,400
But it is surprising that all of a sudden all these rugby games are coming out in America,

2401
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:03,400
but you make a good point about the Rugby World Cup.

2402
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:06,400
I mean, if it's on people's minds, then they're more likely to buy the games.

2403
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,400
Good point.

2404
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:09,400
All right, next one.

2405
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,400
Hey guys, have you seen this?

2406
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,400
It's dragcave.net.

2407
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:16,400
Some of them miss adorable dragons in someone's signature on the Jim Butcher forums.

2408
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:19,400
Anyway, you click on them or view them to help them hatch and grow.

2409
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,400
It has its own Wiki.

2410
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:23,400
I haven't had time to really look into it too much,

2411
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:26,400
but I'm hoping to hatch my little signature eggs.

2412
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,400
Any tips if you guys have played it?

2413
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:31,400
It strikes me as a much nicer sort of Neopets.

2414
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:32,400
That's from Holly.

2415
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:36,400
I was just about to say, I'm hearing Neopets, but interesting.

2416
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:39,400
So it's something you, like, put it in your signature and you get a lot of clicks

2417
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,400
and people hatch it.

2418
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:48,400
That's a good, um, that's a good get people on our website scheme.

2419
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,400
It's kind of smart.

2420
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:50,400
Yeah, it is.

2421
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,400
No, I've never played it.

2422
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,400
I looked at the site.

2423
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,400
It looks kind of neat, but no, I haven't tried it.

2424
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:54,400
Sorry.

2425
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,400
Sorry.

2426
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:58,400
Yeah, I can't say a whole lot on that, but I'll have to look at it.

2427
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,400
Okay.

2428
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,400
We got one from Rababa.

2429
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:01,400
Rababa.

2430
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:05,400
The paranormal pinball table is apparently free on Xbox Live Arcade this week with only

2431
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:09,400
a few days left when you broadcast.

2432
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,400
The pinball on PSN has had it for months.

2433
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:16,400
I know the narrator of the game is supposed to be a Sam Spade sound-alike, but it is clearly

2434
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,400
the actor who voices Peter Griffin on the Family Guy.

2435
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:20,400
Oh my.

2436
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:24,400
Still, it's a fun table that may be guilty of trying to do too many things at once.

2437
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,400
Apparently, let me see if I can see it.

2438
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:29,400
Wait, isn't Peter Griffin the creator of the show?

2439
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:30,400
Seth.

2440
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,400
Yeah, Peter.

2441
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,400
It's Seth MacFarlane.

2442
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,400
I don't think they would have got him to do a video game.

2443
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:36,400
They must have sound really similar.

2444
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:42,400
I'm looking at the table itself, just for a moment, and it kind of seems to me like,

2445
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:46,400
yeah, it's trying to be sort of like Twilight Zone.

2446
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,400
Although the ramps are crazy on it.

2447
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:49,400
Wow.

2448
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,400
Yeah, I'm pissed I forgot to get this.

2449
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:58,400
It's probably like a knockoff of Twilight Zone versus whodunit, you know?

2450
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,400
Anyway.

2451
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:03,400
Okay, we have one from, I'm just, oh, it's from CD Thunder.

2452
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:04,400
Okay.

2453
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:10,400
Hello, Alara, I went to the mall recently and played in the game room for a while.

2454
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,400
During my visit, I noticed that two of my favorite games were gone.

2455
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,400
CarnEvil and House of the Dead.

2456
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:16,400
At least you have a game room still.

2457
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,400
Yeah, at least you have an arcade with actual games.

2458
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,400
I figured they were gone because of the sale the game room was always having.

2459
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,400
The prices looked outrageous.

2460
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,400
One was going for 800 bucks.

2461
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:28,400
Lastly, I got a DS game with all four original Sonic the Hedgehog games on it.

2462
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:31,400
Keep up four original, oh, maybe Spinball.

2463
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:34,400
Keep up the good work, sincerely CD Thunder.

2464
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,400
Or maybe Sonic and Knuckles.

2465
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,400
Could be 3D Blast.

2466
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:38,400
Maybe.

2467
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,400
Do you know I have two copies of that on Saturn?

2468
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,400
Do you really?

2469
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:42,400
How funny.

2470
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,400
Yeah, the whole sale of arcade games, too.

2471
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,400
I mean, you see that, what's that place at the Metreon?

2472
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,400
Tilt was selling a bunch of games.

2473
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,400
And yeah, usually they are going to be a couple hundred dollars.

2474
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:56,400
I mean, keep in mind, dude, you got just a whole game console slash television

2475
02:07:56,400 --> 02:08:01,400
slash stand-up cabinet slash fancy controller all dedicated to one game.

2476
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:02,400
That does cost a couple hundred bucks.

2477
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,400
You can look at Craigslist.

2478
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:06,400
You can find a lot of old arcade games for that kind of price.

2479
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:09,400
But yeah, cabinets are about that price.

2480
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:11,400
And the more elaborate, the more expensive.

2481
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,400
Someday when I have a house, I'll have some arcade machines.

2482
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,400
Someday.

2483
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,400
All right, so are we ready for the next email?

2484
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:17,400
Yes.

2485
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:20,400
Okay, hello, OLR.

2486
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,400
Since we are near the release of Sonic Generations this Tuesday,

2487
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,400
I thought you guys would like to compare some of the music from the game.

2488
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:29,400
Yeah, there's remixes up.

2489
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,400
Rob, you should probably pull up this email because the remix is on here.

2490
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,400
Sure, I'll pull it up right now.

2491
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:39,400
But it has a classic remix of Speed Highway from Sonic Adventure,

2492
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:42,400
which was one of my favorite pieces of music in that game.

2493
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:45,400
A modernized Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone,

2494
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:51,400
and a classic rooftop run from Sonic Unleashed, which I think I played.

2495
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:54,400
Also, it's worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations

2496
02:08:54,400 --> 02:09:00,400
out on November 22nd has its own set of levels to make it unique.

2497
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:07,400
Okay, turn this up so I can hear this.

2498
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:12,400
I approve.

2499
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,400
I've been hearing a lot of good things about Sonic Generations.

2500
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:17,400
I'm just going to post this one on the Tumblr.

2501
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,400
Go for it.

2502
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:21,400
It's also worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations

2503
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:27,400
has its own set of levels to make it unique from the PC 360 and PS3 versions.

2504
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,400
I hope you and your listeners enjoy sampling these tracks.

2505
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,400
Good day.

2506
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:34,400
And this comes from Full Brazilian.

2507
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:41,400
Ouch.

2508
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:45,400
Oh yeah, the Green Hill.

2509
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:48,400
There's a Chemical Plant.

2510
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,400
All right, last one.

2511
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,400
Chemical Plant Zone.

2512
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:54,400
I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.

2513
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,400
Whoops.

2514
02:09:55,400 --> 02:10:02,400
Come on.

2515
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:06,400
But I really like that Speed Highway.

2516
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:14,400
I want to see the gameplay.

2517
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:18,400
That's pretty sweet actually.

2518
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,400
Yeah, I saw a little bit of it.

2519
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:25,400
I really do want that.

2520
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:31,400
Because it looks like it's really going back to some of the Sonic Adventure stuff.

2521
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:35,400
Which Sonic Adventure is probably one of, it's on my list of favorites.

2522
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,400
Okay, I've got to be honest.

2523
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:40,400
I haven't been paying this game much attention because let's be real.

2524
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:41,400
Can we all be real for a minute?

2525
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:44,400
Sonic's been really shitty for a long time.

2526
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:48,400
And, you know, like especially once Sonic 4 kind of came out and it was kind of thud.

2527
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:51,400
You know, like I just kind of say, oh, Sonic game.

2528
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,400
I'm sure it's more shit.

2529
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,400
But I got to say, I'm looking at that.

2530
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,400
That looks nice.

2531
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,400
Let me look at another.

2532
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:08,400
Now that I'm fucking on this, I want to see another little video here.

2533
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:12,400
I'm doing a tutorial here.

2534
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,400
I think this is that same area.

2535
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,400
Let me skip ahead a lot here.

2536
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:16,400
All right.

2537
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,400
Well, I'll go ahead and read the next email if you want.

2538
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,400
Yeah, I'm entranced by the Sonic video.

2539
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,400
It looks pretty awesome.

2540
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,400
Yeah, because it's sort of.

2541
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:26,400
God, it makes me want to barf from all the motion though.

2542
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:33,400
It goes from like a 2.5D to a full, you know, Sonic Adventure style.

2543
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,400
Yeah.

2544
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:37,400
Really want, actually you know what game this makes me think of right off the bat?

2545
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:38,400
What?

2546
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:41,400
Sonic CD.

2547
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:43,400
With how fluid it is.

2548
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,400
I want to hear from the chat room.

2549
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:46,400
If you guys in chat have been playing this, is it good?

2550
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:50,400
Like is this a Sonic game that I should be paying attention to?

2551
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:54,400
Or is this one of those things that looks cool, but it doesn't play so hot?

2552
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,400
It looks like it plays pretty classic though.

2553
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,400
All right.

2554
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:58,400
So shall I go ahead and give you the last two?

2555
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,400
Yes, please.

2556
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:00,400
Sorry, I'll close the video.

2557
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,400
Keep watching.

2558
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,400
I don't care.

2559
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:12,400
Weeks after Cliffy slammed a site for giving Gears 3 an 8.0, the big sites are running stories about gamers criticizing Uncharted 3 getting an 8 score as well.

2560
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:24,400
Am I off base here, or do you think the more the vocal gamers, disregarding the factors that lead to the number score, are more willing to accept a 4 out of 5 rating as being a great game over an 8 of 10 being an 80% or an 80%?

2561
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:28,400
Keep on Robert M.

2562
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:44,400
It really is a matter of numbers and perception because with a 4 out of 5, you've got that 4 so close to the top line, but then an 8 though has two more levels of gradation between it even though it is in theory the exact same rating.

2563
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:47,400
So I think it's just a matter of perception.

2564
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:49,400
People are easily swayed.

2565
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:51,400
Don't look at the numbers.

2566
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:52,400
Look at the content.

2567
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,400
That's what I have to say.

2568
02:12:53,400 --> 02:13:00,400
It's ironic because one of the things I got linked to in our chat room as you're reading that email is the Metacritic for Sonic Generations.

2569
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:03,400
So I'm kind of taking a look at some of the scores.

2570
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:06,400
It has a 77 on Metacritic, which, you know, I don't...

2571
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:13,400
You have to really watch these websites because you're not going to necessarily agree with one or the other.

2572
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:15,400
But some people on here...

2573
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:16,400
It has 77 overall.

2574
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:19,400
Nobody's rated it anything higher than like an 8.5.

2575
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:24,400
But some folks are saying it's good, it's polished.

2576
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:34,400
But then some of the people that are dogging it a little bit like say it's not as good as colors, it's not very creative, and it feels like filler.

2577
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:38,400
And saying that it's just they're shoehorning old Sonic games.

2578
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:41,400
Interesting.

2579
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:45,400
Of course, if they want me to spend 60 bucks on it, it's got to be better than average, right?

2580
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,400
So...

2581
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:48,400
Maybe we'll get some calls on that later.

2582
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,400
I don't know.

2583
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:50,400
Anything else in the mailbag?

2584
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,400
Yes, we do.

2585
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:52,400
Alrighty.

2586
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:53,400
Um...

2587
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:54,400
As soon as I get back to the email...

2588
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,400
Okay, um, the last one is, um, hi, OLR.

2589
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:00,400
It's your friendly neighborhood spazzinator.

2590
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:09,400
I really don't have a gaming-related topic for this week's show, but rather I was hoping that the three of you could possibly send out a happy birthday wish to a first-time listener.

2591
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,400
Nope.

2592
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:11,400
Yes.

2593
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:12,400
Alright.

2594
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:18,400
This is Angie, AKA Gigi, whose birthday is today. That's 11-6.

2595
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:22,400
I couldn't possibly ask for a better friend than her, thanks in advance.

2596
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:25,400
Okay, happy birthday, Gigi!

2597
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,400
Happy birthday.

2598
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:27,400
Happy birthday.

2599
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:30,400
Happy birthday to you.

2600
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:33,400
From Orange Lounge Radio.

2601
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:36,400
You need to come up with an OLR birthday song.

2602
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:39,400
It's your birthday! Good for you!

2603
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:44,400
It's your birthday, here's some poo.

2604
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,400
Happy birthday, for reals.

2605
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:47,400
There you go.

2606
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,400
Actually, or there's this.

2607
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,400
Hold on, let me see if I can do this here.

2608
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:55,400
We could do happy birthday this way.

2609
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,400
Come on, play.

2610
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:00,400
Play, fool!

2611
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:01,400
Oh, this is so weird.

2612
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:02,400
Fail.

2613
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,400
I'm waiting for someone to click the freaking play button on this.

2614
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:05,400
Here we go.

2615
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:16,400
It's Happy Birthday on Mario Paint.

2616
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,400
Do you know something, Rob?

2617
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:19,400
I tried.

2618
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:20,400
Did you know something?

2619
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:24,400
That that song actually is still under copyright law, and that if more than 25 people perform

2620
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:27,400
it in public, you can be sued for public performance.

2621
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,400
Oh, well, you know what you're gonna get from me?

2622
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,400
Nothing, because I'm broke.

2623
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,400
How about some farts?

2624
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:32,400
Exactly.

2625
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,400
I can spare that.

2626
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,400
I have farts in your general direction.

2627
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:38,400
Okay, that's it.

2628
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,400
I played under 30 seconds, that's fair use.

2629
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,400
All right, that's it for the mailbag.

2630
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:45,400
Send us emails, we'll read your emails, and I guess now we'll do your birthday wishes

2631
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:46,400
on the show.

2632
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,400
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2633
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,400
Because Jamie's nice.

2634
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:51,400
Again, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2635
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:55,400
Don't catch her when she's in a bad mood or she'll tell your friend, so what, it's your

2636
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:57,400
birthday, screw you.

2637
02:15:57,400 --> 02:16:18,400
And maybe, just maybe, she'll mention you during a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2638
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:22,400
My FU of the Week goes to the cold that I've had for the last two weeks, especially since

2639
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:28,400
I got sick at Disneyland.

2640
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:37,400
And a secondary FU goes towards, um, and it's, I'm really trying to be understanding and

2641
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:44,500
thoughtful, but learn how to package an InDesign file, please, instead of having me have to

2642
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:49,520
go back and fix all of the damn work because it was not packaged properly with all the

2643
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:55,520
proper link syntax, oh fuck you, InDesign, fuck you so much, I love you, but fuck you.

2644
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:57,520
I'm done.

2645
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:58,520
Loki?

2646
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:05,520
Um, FU to Activision, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, it's always a pain in the ass every

2647
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:12,000
goddamn year when it launches, just with all the regulation, and this customer can't have

2648
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,520
it this time, and everybody's calling and bitching, and I'm gonna sue, and blah blah

2649
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:24,520
blah, and yadda yadda yadda, and so, yeah, fuck you to Call of Duty.

2650
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:30,020
Um, my FU of the Week goes to the country fried steak I had this morning, because seriously,

2651
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:32,520
deep fried steak, like, what the hell's that?

2652
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:37,520
Um, but, um, no actually it was really good, that's why I'm giving it an FU, because, um,

2653
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:43,520
FU to the fact that I'll have to play, like, two hours of Damn Central 2 to work that off.

2654
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:47,520
FU to good tasting food being so bad for you.

2655
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:52,520
Alright, more news stories, and then we're gonna get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

2656
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:55,520
but not just yet, we still have some more news stories.

2657
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:56,520
Loki?

2658
02:17:56,520 --> 02:18:01,520
Yes, um, of course, one of the things we like to complain about is pay to unlock content,

2659
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:08,520
basically content that's DLC that's already on the disc, and so, one such game, the high

2660
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:14,520
profile game you might add, um, that has such a thing would be Gears of War 3, and of course,

2661
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:23,520
uh, the creator, um, Rod Ferguson, is, uh, defending why they do have, uh, pay to unlock

2662
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:26,520
content, or DLC that's already on the disc.

2663
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,520
Can't wait to hear this.

2664
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:33,520
Uh, basically saying, I love this, we're not saying everything on the disc is product,

2665
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:42,520
uh, the disc is another delivery mechanism, so basically their thought is that, um, because

2666
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:48,520
the game was actually done back in the spring, and they kinda held it until the fall, um,

2667
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:54,520
they had already created some of this download content that was gonna be put out there, um,

2668
02:18:54,520 --> 02:19:01,520
and basically, um, you know, uh, they wanted, the first piece of download content had some,

2669
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:06,520
you know, guns and maps and stuff that they needed to have, uh, the data for, for people

2670
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:12,520
that didn't buy it so that you could play with those people and whatnot, um, instead

2671
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:16,520
of just having you download all that again, they just put it on the disc to make it easier

2672
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:20,520
so you didn't have to download everything, but obviously going forward, any other download

2673
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:26,520
content will be, the entire contents will have to be downloaded, um, you know, they

2674
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:30,520
said, we felt it was a win-win, because no one was going, no one is going to have to

2675
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:37,520
download anything huge when the DLC comes out, um, but, I mean, I understand that, but

2676
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:42,520
I think, you know, the whole problem with people seeing this is, like, you get things

2677
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:46,520
like with the Catwoman DLC and stuff, where it's just, like, it's already on disc, but,

2678
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:51,520
you know, obviously if you didn't buy the game new, you have to pay to unlock the content.

2679
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,520
Well, you do have, like, 200 megs to download, because I just did that today.

2680
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:56,520
There's, it's downloading something.

2681
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,520
Okay, so that is download content.

2682
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:00,520
Well, okay, Katamari.

2683
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:01,520
Yeah, the beautiful Katamari.

2684
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,520
The beautiful Katamari had, you know, a lot of pay to unlock levels and stuff like that,

2685
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:10,520
and it's not, you know, it's not the first game, obviously, to have that kind of stuff,

2686
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:15,520
but people kind of seem insulted when, you know, there's stuff, you know, you finish

2687
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:19,520
it and you put it on the disc, you know, you could have just added some more content for

2688
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:24,520
the release game instead of just releasing what you had back in the spring and then adding

2689
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:28,520
some download content later on that I had to pay extra for, for stuff that's already on disc.

2690
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,520
That's what the complaint is.

2691
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:37,520
One of the comments there, I think the thing is that makes it money for people is when it's on disc.

2692
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:43,520
We could have left it off and, you know, hey, there's, here's another disc,

2693
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:46,520
but they believe that they did the right thing.

2694
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:49,520
So, I don't know.

2695
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:53,520
I'm sure they're gonna make a shit ton of money anyway, you know, it doesn't even matter.

2696
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:57,520
But it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of frustrating, delivery mechanism.

2697
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:01,520
Well, I mean, Ridge Racer did it with all their music.

2698
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:03,520
It was all unlocked content.

2699
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:07,520
I remember those, you know, having the keys, Dead Rising has costumes and stuff.

2700
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:10,520
It's, there's a lot of games that do it.

2701
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:14,520
And I think it's kind of lame because you're like, you have this stuff done.

2702
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:19,520
It's not like the game was, I mean, I get some games are delayed or purposefully held

2703
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:24,520
to come out at a certain time, but not all games are like that.

2704
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:27,520
There's a lot of games where it's like, okay, we added some extra, you know,

2705
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:32,520
DLC content like the Earth Defense Force expansions were already on the disc,

2706
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:35,520
all those weapons, and they're charging people for it.

2707
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,520
Can we take a minute to praise somebody that did it right?

2708
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:40,520
And that would be the folks behind Burnout Paradise.

2709
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:43,520
And you want to talk about combating used game sales.

2710
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:47,520
Well, the way you combat used game sales is to make people want to keep the game

2711
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:51,520
and not want to sell it back by doing regular content updates.

2712
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:55,520
Dude, what if you'd, instead of having, you know,

2713
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:58,520
people pay to unlock the additional content that's on the disc,

2714
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:02,520
why not slowly unlock that content over, you know, every couple months,

2715
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:06,520
something new unlocks, give people reason to hold on to their games

2716
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:08,520
and not want to sell them used.

2717
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:12,520
What a novel idea.

2718
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:17,520
Or, you know, then you have also, besides the slowly unlocking content,

2719
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:21,520
you have some really cool download content later on that, you know,

2720
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:24,520
it's like, you know, people that sell their games back are like,

2721
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:27,520
man, man, I really need to buy that again so I can buy this download content.

2722
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:30,520
That's good download content if, you know,

2723
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:33,520
you're willing to re-buy that game to play that content.

2724
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:36,520
Spaznator PC in our chat room says, this begs a question, though,

2725
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:40,520
at which point will we have $60 for a game,

2726
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:43,520
and then pay additional money to unlock the whole game?

2727
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:45,520
How about the new Mortal Kombat game that came out?

2728
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,520
I mean, you had to pay money for the extra characters.

2729
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:50,520
I mean, I guess you could say that's extra or whatever.

2730
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:54,520
But how about Arkham City, the Catwoman stuff?

2731
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:57,520
I guess you could say, okay, well, the code does come with the game,

2732
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,520
but, you know, there are a bunch of trophies and story elements

2733
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:03,520
that if you don't have that code, you're not going to get.

2734
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:08,520
Or, heaven forbid, you got one of those boxes where the code is missing.

2735
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:10,520
Even though, I guess, Warner Brothers has a little workaround,

2736
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:14,520
but still, it's an awful inconvenience to the consumer.

2737
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:16,520
Battlefield will have the same problem?

2738
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:18,520
Oh, yeah.

2739
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:24,520
So, I mean, sure, there'll be more maps for Halo and, you know, whatever.

2740
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:27,520
It's amazing. If you just think of the long term,

2741
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:30,520
I bet you could use game sales easy

2742
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:33,520
by continuing to provide the regular content to keep it exciting.

2743
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,520
Arkham City, for example.

2744
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,520
You beat the game, but you haven't finished the game.

2745
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:40,520
There's so much more to do.

2746
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:42,520
Right. Let's see.

2747
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:45,520
There is a big show coming up in a couple weeks

2748
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,520
where they show a lot of arcade games,

2749
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,520
and one of the rumors going around about this upcoming arcade show

2750
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:55,520
is that Bejeweled is going to show up as an amusement title.

2751
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:58,520
Yeah, apparently one of the biggest casual games ever,

2752
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:02,520
Sega Amusements, is supposed to be showing this.

2753
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:06,520
Now, this could just be a huge rumor, but they are saying that Bejeweled

2754
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:09,520
could be just like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade and so forth

2755
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:13,520
that could be making its way from a casual game to the arcade.

2756
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:17,520
Here's my question. Is it going to spit out tickets?

2757
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:21,520
Because that seems to be the only way the games last in the arcade these days.

2758
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,520
What would you guys think of a Bejeweled arcade game?

2759
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:26,520
I wouldn't play it.

2760
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:29,520
I like Bejeweled, and if it spits out tickets,

2761
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:31,520
it'll be a good ticket-spitting game.

2762
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:33,520
I'm really sad that I'm admitting this,

2763
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:36,520
but otherwise would I pay to play it in the arcades?

2764
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:39,520
Not unless it gives me some type of experience I can't get at home,

2765
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:43,520
which I doubt, unless it's like, I don't know,

2766
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:48,520
really somehow touch-based and somehow really fun and different,

2767
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:51,520
but I just don't see how many ways you do Bejeweled.

2768
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:53,520
Don't get me wrong, Bejeweled is a great game,

2769
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,520
but is it worth 50 cents to play good?

2770
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:02,520
Sure. So, we'll see.

2771
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:05,520
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news,

2772
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,520
Dark Sakura, while I try to get the livestream up,

2773
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:09,520
because we crashed again. Hooray!

2774
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:14,520
Aw, boo. Well, LEGO Universe is going away.

2775
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:17,520
Aw, so sad.

2776
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,520
Because they're not getting enough players.

2777
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:26,520
They haven't got enough players and enough paying subscribers,

2778
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:31,520
so LEGO Universe is going to be closing on January 31st, 2012.

2779
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:36,520
And they are also going to be closing the Playwell studio,

2780
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:42,520
which will be laying off 115 people. Sadness.

2781
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:45,520
That is sad. Again, more job losses. That's sad.

2782
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:47,520
But I didn't even, okay, this is sad,

2783
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,520
but I didn't even realize LEGO Universe was out.

2784
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:52,520
It was supposed to be this big MMO, right?

2785
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:54,520
It came out about a year ago.

2786
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:56,520
Was it supposed to be out on DS or something?

2787
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:58,520
Like, it was supposed to be an MMO on the 3DS or something?

2788
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:00,520
Am I crazy?

2789
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:02,520
No, you're thinking of...

2790
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:04,520
Oh, what is it?

2791
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:06,520
The one that's like Grand Theft Auto.

2792
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:12,520
It's LEGO City Stories, which I will be buying.

2793
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:14,520
Ah, that's it.

2794
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:16,520
I will be buying LEGO City Stories.

2795
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:18,520
Okay, I gotta confuse LEGO City Stories.

2796
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,520
Alright.

2797
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:22,520
But yeah, it's basically not enough players,

2798
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:24,520
not enough paying people, so they can't afford to keep it open.

2799
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:26,520
Interesting that they didn't decide to go free to...

2800
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:28,520
Oh, no, they already were free to play, weren't they?

2801
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:30,520
Oh, bummer.

2802
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:32,520
And the quote says,

2803
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:34,520
It has not been possible to convert a satisfactory number of players

2804
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:36,520
to paying subscribers.

2805
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:38,520
In other words, ain't no one playing this.

2806
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:40,520
No, ain't no one paying for it.

2807
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:42,520
They just want to play the free stuff.

2808
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:44,520
Sure.

2809
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:46,520
They don't want to pay for content.

2810
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:48,520
They just want to play the free stuff.

2811
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:50,520
I'm curious to see if DC Universe is able to make money.

2812
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:52,520
That'd be interesting.

2813
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:54,520
Oh, I'm sure.

2814
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:56,520
Well, of course you have so many people that already bought it.

2815
02:26:56,520 --> 02:26:58,520
And if you pay five bucks for it,

2816
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:00,520
for, like, content,

2817
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,520
you get an account upgrade.

2818
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:04,520
The same thing as with Star Trek Online.

2819
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,520
That's why when I start Star Trek Online,

2820
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,520
I'm automatically going in with the middle-level account.

2821
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:10,520
Oh, that's cool.

2822
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:12,520
Because you've paid for it in the past.

2823
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,520
Well, apart from, yeah, my subscription,

2824
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:16,520
I bought Cryptic Points

2825
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:18,520
so that I could get

2826
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:20,520
the extra uniforms

2827
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:22,520
and the other ship and stuff.

2828
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:24,520
But honestly,

2829
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:26,520
I haven't spent more than 20 bucks outside on that game.

2830
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:28,520
Just a couple more news stories for you guys,

2831
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:30,520
and then we're going to get into

2832
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:32,520
the Skype line and your Twitter topics

2833
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:34,520
at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, so last chance

2834
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,520
to get those in. Loki.

2835
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:38,520
Ah, yes. So, as we mentioned

2836
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:40,520
before, the Mass Effect 3

2837
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:42,520
beta has

2838
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,520
leaked out.

2839
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,520
Apparently, there was a private

2840
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:48,520
closed beta for Mass Effect 3,

2841
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:50,520
and somehow they kind of

2842
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:52,520
accidentally threw it up on there for everybody to download.

2843
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:54,520
And, you know, it gives

2844
02:27:54,520 --> 02:27:56,520
people access to both

2845
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:58,520
single-player and multiplayer sections of the game.

2846
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:00,520
And, of course, because of that, there's been

2847
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:02,520
lots of screenshots and whatnot

2848
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:04,520
showing, you know, different things

2849
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:06,520
like origin support, multiplayer character

2850
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:08,520
creation, level selection,

2851
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:10,520
stats,

2852
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:12,520
you know,

2853
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:14,520
new user interfaces and whatnot.

2854
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:16,520
So, uh,

2855
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:18,520
neat. Of course, the game

2856
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:20,520
will be coming out in February.

2857
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:22,520
It's not February, March. I know it's

2858
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:24,520
spring.

2859
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:26,520
Lots of stuff coming out in the spring.

2860
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:30,520
Alright.

2861
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:32,520
Well, yeah, Mass Effect's going to be a huge one, though.

2862
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:34,520
But, oops on that leak, right?

2863
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:36,520
Yep. Not much.

2864
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:38,520
It's not really a closed beta if you put it out for everybody.

2865
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:40,520
Well, that was a Microsoft booboo

2866
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:42,520
from what I understand. Man, I would be

2867
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:44,520
pissed if I were them.

2868
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:46,520
So.

2869
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:48,520
Alright, moving on to

2870
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:50,520
one more story for you guys, and

2871
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:52,520
this goes back to the music games.

2872
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:54,520
DDR, of course, getting a new version.

2873
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:56,520
But they're redoing Second Mix. Remember, we talked about

2874
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:58,520
the new arcade mix that's going to have Second Mix inside it?

2875
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,520
Well, to celebrate Dance Dance

2876
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:02,520
Revolution X3 versus Second Mix,

2877
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:04,520
there's going to be a new

2878
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:06,520
Second Mix soundtrack that includes

2879
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:08,520
remixes. They are remixing

2880
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:10,520
Keep On Movin' by Y and Co.

2881
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:12,520
Y and Co.

2882
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:14,520
Put Your Faith in Me by

2883
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:16,520
DA's Twinkly Disco Remix.

2884
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,520
Trip Machine, the

2885
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:20,520
Zack Nonoglide mix, Brilliant

2886
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:22,520
to You, the AKBK

2887
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,520
mix, and Paranoia,

2888
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:26,520
the KST mix,

2889
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:28,520
and Love is the Power, Reborn.

2890
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:30,520
I don't remember a song called Love is the Power.

2891
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:32,520
I think it was one of the menu ones.

2892
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,520
Oh, that's why. Got it.

2893
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:36,520
And apparently there's going to be a special

2894
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:38,520
DVD that has videos

2895
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,520
for Butterfly Boom Boom Dollar

2896
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:42,520
and Brilliant to You. Interviews

2897
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,520
with Naoki, Yuwan,

2898
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:46,520
DJ Taka, Y and Co,

2899
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:48,520
so on and so on. That's all coming out November 30th

2900
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:50,520
is when the soundtrack comes out. That means the arcade

2901
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:52,520
game is going to be out soon. I kind of

2902
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:54,520
want to go play it just to play Second Mix mode.

2903
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:56,520
Forget these newfangled

2904
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:58,520
songs. You know what, Rob? What?

2905
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:00,520
I can hook up the Dreamcast, and we can play

2906
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:02,520
Second Mix. It's just not the same as

2907
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:04,520
Dance Battle, Rob. A pretty high-def TV.

2908
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:06,520
Because didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about

2909
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:08,520
how they were redoing the graphics in HD

2910
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:10,520
and all that? And it sounded kind of neat.

2911
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:12,520
You know, for us super music

2912
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:14,520
game nerd fans, it sounded super neat. You know what?

2913
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:16,520
What? I completely

2914
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:18,520
forgot that it was on my phone, but I

2915
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:20,520
actually giggled in my car the

2916
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:22,520
other day because Love came on my iPhone.

2917
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:24,520
Oh, really? I forgot I had the whole

2918
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:26,520
Sonic Dreams CD

2919
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:28,520
when it came out. Nice. Very nice.

2920
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,520
Alright, yeah.

2921
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:32,520
In our chatroom it says, Love is the power is the ending

2922
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:34,520
of Second Mix, isn't it? Yeah, I think you're right. Now that you're saying it,

2923
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,520
I'm like, yeah, that sounds right.

2924
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:38,520
There you go. There you have it.

2925
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,520
Let's move on to the Skype line.

2926
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:42,520

So give us a call if you want. OrangeLoungeRadio

2931

on Skype or 1877

2932
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:54,520
Game O-L-R.

2933
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:56,520
Meanwhile, let's go

2934
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:58,520
to some tweets.

2935
02:30:58,520 --> 02:31:00,520
On the Twitter, NicoNicoChan

2936
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:02,520
tweeted us this week at Twitter.com

2937
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:04,520
slash O-L-R and put, Have any

2938
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:06,520
of you played the game Hyper

2939
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:08,520
Dimension Neptunia?

2940
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:10,520
Does this sound familiar to anyone? Yeah, it does

2941
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:12,520
sound familiar. It's on the PlayStation. I

2942
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:14,520
had to read up on it. It's on the PlayStation

2943
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:16,520
3 and it's kind of like,

2944
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:18,520
well, this is what I thought was

2945
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:20,520
interesting. It's the console wars

2946
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,520
as represented

2947
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:24,520
by female

2948
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:26,520
anime chicks.

2949
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:28,520
Yes, there's that.

2950
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:30,520
I didn't expect anime chicks to be female. There's two

2951
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:32,520
things that made me think this was very interesting

2952
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:34,520
and one of them was the fact that it's by the company

2953
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:36,520
Compile Heart

2954
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:38,520
which is actually the dude that used

2955
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:40,520
to lead Compile, I guess made this company.

2956
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:42,520
Now granted, he left in like 2006

2957
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:44,520
or something like that, but I don't know.

2958
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:46,520
It kind of gave me hope for like

2959
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:48,520
just half a second that maybe just

2960
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:50,520
possibly someday

2961
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,520
it could come, they could come back with

2962
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:54,520
they could come back

2963
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:56,520
with another version of the Guardian

2964
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:58,520
Legend. I would hope so.

2965
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:00,520
Or at least another

2966
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:02,520
Guardia game.

2967
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,520
Maybe the franchise

2968
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:06,520
could totally work, touched up for the

2969
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:08,520
modern era. Right. Yeah.

2970
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,520
So I was going to try to bring up the YouTube

2971
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:12,520
but we're having to deal on the podcast right

2972
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:14,520
now with the internet feed

2973
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,520
being down, so I can't even bring up YouTube

2974
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:18,520
because our internet is completely down right now. We're not even

2975
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:20,520
live. Live listeners can't hear us.

2976
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:22,520
So I'm left with nothing but Twitter because no one

2977
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:24,520
can call us either.

2978
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:26,520
So let me go to Twitter. I'm keeping an eye on it Rob.

2979
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:28,520
I know, thank you.

2980
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:30,520
Going to Surtur on the Twitter says

2981
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:32,520
I have a new Android phone. What are some good games?

2982
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,520
Free or money?

2983
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:36,520
Love OLR. Thank you.

2984
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:38,520
Android games. We all

2985
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:40,520
have iOS.

2986
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:42,520
I have a shitty Android

2987
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:44,520
so I don't play anything on there.

2988
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:46,520
Well I mean

2989
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:48,520
a lot of the games that are on iOS are also

2990
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:50,520
on Android so

2991
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:52,520
I'm sure there's

2992
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:54,520
pretty much a lot of stuff crosses over.

2993
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:56,520
I can't think of any Android

2994
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:58,520
specific games that

2995
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:00,520
I mean if you have

2996
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:02,520
a good enough Android phone I guess

2997
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:04,520
so there's also the PlayStation Suite stuff

2998
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:06,520
where you can play old PlayStation 1

2999
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:08,520
games.

3000
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:10,520
MNZeba on Twitter

3001
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:12,520
Minecraft

3002
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:14,520
if you're into that.

3003
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:16,520
That's your thing.

3004
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:18,520
MNZeba had sent us a tweet saying

3005
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:20,520
OLR I found this while I was walking

3006
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:22,520
around Coles. There are so many things

3007
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:24,520
wrong with this. I can't bring up the picture again but

3008
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:26,520
I actually thankfully I looked at it before

3009
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:28,520
we recorded

3010
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:30,520
tonight and it was like a picture. It was like a duck

3011
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:32,520
hunt game. Yeah I saw that. Did you

3012
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:34,520
see that? What the heck was that? It's like a duck

3013
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:36,520
hunt. I'm assuming

3014
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:38,520
it was one of those plug and play kind of style games.

3015
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:40,520
Yeah. Or something. It just looks

3016
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:42,520
derpy. It looked a little weird

3017
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:44,520
but not completely out of character

3018
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,520
or you know whatever for those plug and play

3019
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:48,520
games.

3020
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:52,520
Quick we need a filler topic. I need to

3021
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:54,520
relay a message to the chat room real quick.

3022
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:56,520
Is this resolved? Oh are we

3023
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:58,520
able to come back then? We're connected again.

3024
02:33:58,520 --> 02:34:00,520
We're up again? We're up again.

3025
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:02,520
Oh we are. We are

3026
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:04,520
up again. We're just not on

3027
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:06,520
the chats.

3028
02:34:06,520 --> 02:34:08,520
I'm not up yet. I'm showing you the

3029
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:10,520
chats. No we just came back on the

3030
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:12,520
feed.

3031
02:34:12,520 --> 02:34:14,520
So there you go.

3032
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,520
Alright so we're coming back. Sorry

3033
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:18,520
podcast listeners but the fun and joy

3034
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:20,520
of doing live radio is that sometimes

3035
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,520
your interwebs gets all screwed up.

3036
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:24,520
So we were just reading through

3037
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:26,520
some tweets live listeners

3038
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:28,520
and we were on that

3039
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:30,520
duck hunter game that MNZeba sent us.

3040
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:32,520
Now I can see the picture. It says

3041
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:34,520
indoor outdoor duck hunting game.

3042
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:36,520
It is not a plug and

3043
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:38,520
play thing like I originally thought. I guess

3044
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:40,520
this thing actually launches

3045
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:42,520
fake ducks into the air and

3046
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:44,520
you can shoot them. But they say it's safe

3047
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:46,520
and fun. But god if you had all

3048
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:48,520
those projectiles going around the house

3049
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:50,520
wouldn't that be kind of a bad idea?

3050
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:52,520
I wouldn't do

3051
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:54,520
it inside. I wouldn't do it

3052
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:56,520
inside either unless you have like a huge

3053
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:58,520
studio empty bedroom. It makes me

3054
02:34:58,520 --> 02:35:00,520
think though. The dishes are done

3055
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:02,520
man.

3056
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:04,520
Alright now I can go

3057
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:06,520
to some of these links that

3058
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:08,520
Tigerclaw sent us because I wasn't able to pull them up

3059
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:10,520
before. But on the Twitter. Twitter.com

3060
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:12,520
O-L-R. By the way Skype line should be back as you

3061
02:35:12,520 --> 02:35:14,520
guys are reconnecting to the feed.

3062
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:16,520
1877

3063
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:18,520
game O-L-R or our username on Skype

3064
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:20,520
is OrangeLoungeRadio

3065
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:22,520
Tigerclaw had sent us a tweet. Apparently

3066
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:24,520
some bandits stole six

3067
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:26,520
thousand copies of

3068
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:28,520
Modern Warfare 3.

3069
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:30,520
In France a truck full

3070
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:32,520
of copies of the game was hijacked

3071
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:34,520
by professional thieves.

3072
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:36,520
The truck was driving through southern Paris

3073
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:38,520
on Saturday and it was rammed by

3074
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:40,520
another vehicle. Two men emerged

3075
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:42,520
from the colliding car with knives

3076
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:44,520
used tear gas to

3077
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:46,520
subdue the driver and got

3078
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:48,520
away with six thousand video games

3079
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:50,520
which they are valuing at four hundred

3080
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:52,520
thousand euros. That's

3081
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:54,520
crazy. But apparently the game was

3082
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:56,520
Modern Warfare 3. So if you see

3083
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:58,520
some early copies on French eBay

3084
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:00,520
you know where it

3085
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:02,520
came from. French eBay

3086
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:04,520
get it?

3087
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:06,520
So

3088
02:36:06,520 --> 02:36:08,520
there you go.

3089
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:10,520
No not French eBay.

3090
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:14,520
Alright moving

3091
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:16,520
on to another tweet here from Tigerclaw

3092
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:18,520
one more. Where in the world

3093
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:20,520
is Carmen Sandiego is being turned

3094
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:22,520
into a live action film?

3095
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:24,520
Is this trolling? Because

3096
02:36:24,520 --> 02:36:26,520
seriously I clicked on this and

3097
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:28,520
Walden Media and

3098
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:32,520
Jennifer Lopez

3099
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:34,520
are teaming

3100
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:36,520
up to do Where in the World is Carmen

3101
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:38,520
Sandiego? Please say this

3102
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:40,520
is a troll post.

3103
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:42,520
Are you trolling us? Is this

3104
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:44,520
trolling on Twitter please?

3105
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:46,520
Walden Media

3106
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:48,520
they're the guys that did the

3107
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:50,520
Chronicles of Narnia right? Has acquired the

3108
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:52,520
rights to turn Where in the World is Carmen

3109
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:54,520
Sandiego into a live action film involving

3110
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:56,520
Jennifer Lopez.

3111
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:58,520
I guess I could see like

3112
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:00,520
like physically that kind of looks right

3113
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:02,520
but

3114
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:06,520
it could

3115
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:08,520
be an interesting movie but I wonder if they're going to

3116
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:10,520
make it just like a straight up kids movie.

3117
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:12,520
I think that's where they would go with it.

3118
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:14,520
You know like kind of like Inspector Gadget

3119
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:16,520
or something like that.

3120
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:18,520
I don't know. That's what I kind of think.

3121
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:20,520
Although I will say this

3122
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:22,520
if it doesn't have this as the theme song

3123
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:24,520
then I don't

3124
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:26,520
if it doesn't have this as the theme song then it doesn't

3125
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:30,520
count.

3126
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:40,520
Can you imagine

3127
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:42,520
Jennifer Lopez featuring

3128
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:44,520
Pitbull just ruining this fucking song?

3129
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:54,520
Alright. At a theater near you soon

3130
02:37:54,520 --> 02:37:56,520
apparently.

3131
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:58,520
Alright. Again the phone number

3132
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:00,520
1877 game OLR username on

3133
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:02,520
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to

3134
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:04,520
give us a call. And that's all the tweets too. Let me reload

3135
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:06,520
just in case things came through and we had the

3136
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:08,520
internet downtime that we

3137
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:10,520
were having. Did we

3138
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:12,520
go down again?

3139
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:14,520
This is terrible. What's terrible?

3140
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:16,520
I looked up a little bit more

3141
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:18,520
information on that

3142
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:20,520
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego thing.

3143
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:22,520
Here's the film's log line they say.

3144
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:24,520
What's a log line?

3145
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:26,520
I think it's like the pitch basically.

3146
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:28,520
When the ACME agency's

3147
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:30,520
greatest detective Carmen

3148
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:32,520
Sandiego becomes the world's greatest

3149
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:34,520
thief it's up to her former

3150
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:36,520
partner to follow her

3151
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:38,520
clues and track her down.

3152
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:40,520
Their cat and mouse game leads the partner

3153
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:42,520
to confront a greater mystery

3154
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:44,520
is Carmen really a thief or a

3155
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:46,520
hero?

3156
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:48,520
Oh great. So Carmen Sandiego may

3157
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:52,520
not end up even being like you know a villainous.

3158
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:54,520
Yeah.

3159
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:56,520
Exactly.

3160
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:58,520
Alright.

3161
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:00,520
That is it for

3162
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:04,520
the tweets tonight.

3163
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,520
I'm gonna try re-logging into Skype

3164
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:08,520
because some folks are telling me that they can't see

3165
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:10,520
us on Skype and it might be because we

3166
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:12,520
went down while we were on.

3167
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:16,520
Yay internet issues. Live radio.

3168
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:18,520
Do we have any last minute stories

3169
02:39:18,520 --> 02:39:20,520
or other stories we didn't get to in the show tonight

3170
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:22,520
that we can fill a little time with while I try

3171
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:24,520
to get the Skype line working?

3172
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:26,520
I like pie and cake

3173
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:28,520
and ice cream and

3174
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:30,520
fire and um

3175
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:32,520
Okay we're up. We're getting calls. There we go.

3176
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,520
It's finally working. Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3177
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:36,520
It's Shane.

3178
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:38,520
Hey. Shane AKA Miklatov right?

3179
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:40,520
Sure. What's up?

3180
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:42,520
Nothing. Just playing some while.

3181
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:44,520
Oops. I'm holding down shift and talking in vent.

3182
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:48,520
Who are you talking to in vent?

3183
02:39:48,520 --> 02:39:50,520
Us talking to Todd. We're playing a dungeon.

3184
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:52,520
Oh I see. Even though you guys live in the same house

3185
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:54,520
and he's upstairs.

3186
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:56,520
Yeah. He's upstairs. So it makes it so I don't have to yell.

3187
02:39:56,520 --> 02:39:58,520
I see. Alright. That's fine.

3188
02:39:58,520 --> 02:40:00,520
Um.

3189
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:02,520
Anyway. What was I talking about?

3190
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:04,520
Was I talking about anything yet? Because I don't think I was.

3191
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:06,520
No. You were talking about

3192
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:08,520
playing WoW and then calling into the show.

3193
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:10,520
Oh. Yeah. I'm calling because

3194
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:12,520
you said I should call because of Sonic

3195
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:14,520
Generations. Oh yeah.

3196
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:16,520
Because we actually own it. Do ya? How is it?

3197
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,520
Yes. It's pretty fantastic

3198
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:20,520
and I want to add

3199
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:22,520
for a Sonic game after that

3200
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:24,520
but it's actually just a

3201
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:26,520
pretty good game. Now the Metacritic

3202
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:28,520
scores were kind of fair.

3203
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:30,520
Fairly good I guess. Not like spectacular

3204
02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:32,520
but like it's alright. It's pretty

3205
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:34,520
good. It was kind of what Metacritic said. Well the thing is

3206
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:36,520
with you know a 77%

3207
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:38,520
I think you said it was

3208
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:40,520
that is you know

3209
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:42,520
average. It should be average at least

3210
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:44,520
if you go by like the

3211
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:46,520
like a school grading scale

3212
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:48,520
or it's well above average if you go

3213
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:50,520
by a regular grading scale but

3214
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:52,520
regardless it's a nice throwback

3215
02:40:52,520 --> 02:40:54,520
to classic Sonic and the way that

3216
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:56,520
Sonic 4 was but a little bit better.

3217
02:40:56,520 --> 02:40:58,520
Um.

3218
02:40:58,520 --> 02:41:00,520
And

3219
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:02,520
the best part about it to me is

3220
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:04,520
all the music because

3221
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:06,520
like say you're playing

3222
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:08,520
a Sonic adventure level

3223
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:10,520
and you're playing as new Sonic

3224
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:12,520
and then you go and play as fat old Sonic

3225
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:14,520
it changes the music

3226
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:16,520
like one of them went to like a synth poppy

3227
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:18,520
song because obviously if you're

3228
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:20,520
playing on a Genesis you would not have

3229
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:22,520
that style CD quality music.

3230
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:24,520
What's the whole twist with the new and old Sonic?

3231
02:41:24,520 --> 02:41:26,520
Like I seriously don't know. I have not been following this game.

3232
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:28,520
There's like some

3233
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:30,520
evil force and it

3234
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:32,520
messes up time and you get

3235
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:34,520
thrown around

3236
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:36,520
so am I correct in thinking

3237
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:38,520
they yet again are cashing in on

3238
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:40,520
nostalgic Sonic? Oh yeah

3239
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:42,520
because from what I was

3240
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:44,520
watching Todd play and it looks like

3241
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:46,520
the first three stages are from

3242
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:48,520
Sonic 1 the next three are Sonic

3243
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:50,520
oh no sorry the first three are Genesis

3244
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:52,520
era so it's Sonic 1, 2 and 3

3245
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:54,520
and then it's like

3246
02:41:54,520 --> 02:41:56,520
um gosh dang it

3247
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:58,520
I want to say the next is Dreamcast

3248
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:00,520
and then the next ones

3249
02:42:00,520 --> 02:42:02,520
after that are like the newer Sonic

3250
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:04,520
games. So it's like a Mario Kart game.

3251
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:06,520
A Mario Kart

3252
02:42:06,520 --> 02:42:08,520
oh like you saw the old track stuff

3253
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:10,520
yeah yeah kind of

3254
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:12,520
um but seriously it's all about the

3255
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:14,520
music when I heard

3256
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:16,520
uh just random

3257
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:18,520
and to me awesome vocal

3258
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:20,520
songs from like the Sonic

3259
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:22,520
Dreamcast days I got really excited

3260
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:24,520
because I

3261
02:42:24,520 --> 02:42:26,520
think those songs are amazing. So it's nostalgia that

3262
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:28,520
works for you then? Yes and I'm not

3263
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:30,520
even a huge fan of Sonic in the least

3264
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:32,520
but it is pretty

3265
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:34,520
neat. Alright well I'll have to check it out. Is it

3266
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:36,520
still 60 bucks though? Yes

3267
02:42:36,520 --> 02:42:38,520
it is. Well off and on

3268
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:40,520
like um at work we had it for

3269
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:42,520
39 for a few days

3270
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:44,520
that's not as bad. Still

3271
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:46,520
there's too many games to play right now. I've got to play

3272
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:48,520
Arkham City is really good and then I

3273
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:50,520
play Skyrim. I have that and uh

3274
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:52,520
I've played it it's okay. You don't like

3275
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:54,520
Arkham City? What's wrong with you?

3276
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:56,520
It's just Batman

3277
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:58,520
I'd rather

3278
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:00,520
be playing the Uncharted. But it's goddamn Batman

3279
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:02,520
Alright

3280
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:04,520
uh anything else you want to talk about that you're

3281
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:06,520
doing in the gaming world?

3282
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:08,520
Um well I already talked about the

3283
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:10,520
Old Republic stuff on Horde House

3284
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:12,520
so. Which everybody should listen to. Hordehouse.com

3285
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:14,520
it's LulzyWarcraft even if

3286
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:16,520
you don't like Warcraft you get to hear dick and fart jokes.

3287
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:18,520
Yeah that's terrible

3288
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:20,520
um but

3289
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:22,520
uh

3290
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:24,520
Uncharted 3 like is getting

3291
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:26,520
I guess somewhat

3292
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:28,520
okay reviews not like oh my god

3293
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:30,520
outstanding like the second one

3294
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:32,520
and for when I've played of it so far

3295
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:34,520
I kind of agree

3296
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:36,520
which makes me sad because I am a huge

3297
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:38,520
Uncharted fan. I even have an Uncharted

3298
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:40,520
3 standee in my basement

3299
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:42,520
that I stole from work.

3300
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:44,520
Okay I got to know more about this. I forgot Uncharted

3301
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:46,520
3 was out this week. Again another freaking game

3302
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:48,520
I just don't have time to play.

3303
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:50,520
Uncharted 2 was so so so

3304
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:52,520
well received and had so many people

3305
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:54,520
excited about the third one.

3306
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:56,520
Oh yeah. What's the misstep for you?

3307
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:58,520
Why are you not feeling it? Is it because maybe it's

3308
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:00,520
too much more of the same or is it like did they

3309
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:02,520
do a change that doesn't feel right?

3310
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:04,520
Well I don't want to give

3311
02:44:04,520 --> 02:44:06,520
a lot of spoilers away of course

3312
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:08,520
because that's mean and I don't

3313
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:10,520
I haven't beaten it yet so

3314
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:12,520
from what I've played so far which is probably about

3315
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:14,520
six hours

3316
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:16,520
um it feels like

3317
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:18,520
like

3318
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,520
okay the step from one to

3319
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,520
two in the series was

3320
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:24,520
drastic and amazing.

3321
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:26,520
This one feels like they took all the

3322
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:28,520
good parts of two and then

3323
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:30,520
like the combat is a little

3324
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:32,520
bit better if not a little bit harder

3325
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:34,520
um the graphics

3326
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:36,520
are better but the story

3327
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:38,520
just isn't quite

3328
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:40,520
there. It seems to be

3329
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:42,520
everybody just saying

3330
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:44,520
you know hey Nathan Drake why

3331
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:46,520
do you chase treasure? You're stupid.

3332
02:44:46,520 --> 02:44:48,520
Okay so it's not like the

3333
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:50,520
story is not nearly as gripping

3334
02:44:50,520 --> 02:44:52,520
as previously. No not at all.

3335
02:44:52,520 --> 02:44:54,520
And they're using all these and

3336
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:56,520
you know the stories

3337
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:58,520
aren't realistic in the least

3338
02:44:58,520 --> 02:45:00,520
and the first game had like

3339
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:02,520
Nazi zombie mutant things

3340
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:04,520
and the second game had these

3341
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:06,520
Aztec-y big bulky

3342
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:08,520
guys that drank some

3343
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:10,520
liquid that made them super buff

3344
02:45:10,520 --> 02:45:12,520
but this one's using like

3345
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:14,520
like technology you would see in

3346
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:16,520
James Bond and

3347
02:45:16,520 --> 02:45:18,520
it just isn't doing anything for me.

3348
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:20,520
Interesting.

3349
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:22,520
Speaking of James Bond didn't those GoldenEye

3350
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:24,520
remakes come out too this week? Yeah they

3351
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:26,520
did. Oh my god. Yeah. Busy week.

3352
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:28,520
And the PS3 one has like a

3353
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:30,520
move bundle that looks pretty nice.

3354
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:32,520
Interesting. Alright

3355
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:34,520
well meekles off I'm gonna let you go. Do you have

3356
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:36,520
any other thoughts for listeners before we get more calls?

3357
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:38,520
Nope. Alright.

3358
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:40,520
Well have fun on vent doing quests.

3359
02:45:40,520 --> 02:45:42,520
Okay. Good times. Bye.

3360
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:44,520
1877 Game OLR or a username

3361
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:46,520
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you would

3362
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:48,520
like to give us a call.

3363
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:50,520
Some folks in chat chat.orangeloungeradio.com

3364
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:52,520
actdeft I think he's talking about the

3365
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:54,520
Sonic game in our chat room says

3366
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:56,520
$30 on Steam. That's not

3367
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:58,520
nearly as bad. That's

3368
02:45:58,520 --> 02:46:00,520
I can check. And I wonder if during the

3369
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:02,520
holiday sale it'll be dirt cheap.

3370
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:04,520
That's the thing with Steam games. Dirt cheap during the holidays?

3371
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:06,520
I'm on it. Yeah I know seriously right?

3372
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:08,520
That's where I'm at.

3373
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:10,520
1877 Game OLR

3374
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:12,520
or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3375
02:46:12,520 --> 02:46:14,520
Loki I don't know if you had a minute to

3376
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:16,520
look and see if there's anything last minute to talk about

3377
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:18,520
to help us fill time here because of our downtime.

3378
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:20,520
They relaunched Playstation Home.

3379
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:22,520
Oh yeah I forgot that was this week.

3380
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:24,520
So it's all fantastic now I guess.

3381
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:26,520
I don't know. I haven't logged in.

3382
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:28,520
What were they supposed to change?

3383
02:46:28,520 --> 02:46:30,520
I heard like questing and shit now.

3384
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:32,520
It's like all completely redone.

3385
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:34,520
I mean it looks like Disneyland almost the way they have it.

3386
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:36,520
Don't say words that are going to make me want to

3387
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:38,520
download it immediately if it's not that good.

3388
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,520
It's segmented like a theme park

3389
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:42,520
so they've got different sections

3390
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:44,520
like you know a midway

3391
02:46:44,520 --> 02:46:46,520
It's more of a sports center

3392
02:46:46,520 --> 02:46:48,520
It's more of a Knott's Berry Farm.

3393
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:50,520
Yeah.

3394
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:52,520
Alright.

3395
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:54,520
So that's neat I guess.

3396
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:56,520
And then

3397
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:58,520
you know the folks that did

3398
02:46:58,520 --> 02:47:00,520
that wonderful King's Quest

3399
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:02,520
The Silver Lining they're actually putting out

3400
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:04,520
an original game. Oh yeah

3401
02:47:04,520 --> 02:47:06,520
I heard about that too. That sounds awesome.

3402
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:08,520
Cognition and it's

3403
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:10,520
basically an episodic detective

3404
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:12,520
adventure about an FBI agent

3405
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:14,520
who gains the power to see past events

3406
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:16,520
by touching any object.

3407
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:20,520
And of course they have a Kickstarter up to

3408
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:22,520
fund it and they're looking for $25,000.

3409
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:24,520
And you get all sorts

3410
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:26,520
of sweet shit if you

3411
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:28,520
contribute to that.

3412
02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:34,520
And then there's a rumor

3413
02:47:34,520 --> 02:47:36,520
that Mega Man may be coming to

3414
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:38,520
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

3415
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:40,520
I guess there's a

3416
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:42,520
poster in the background of

3417
02:47:42,520 --> 02:47:44,520
one of the levels that's inspired from

3418
02:47:44,520 --> 02:47:46,520
an Uncanny X-Men cover

3419
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:48,520
and they have Mega Man

3420
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:50,520
on there.

3421
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,520
That was from the

3422
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:54,520
not the mutant massacre but the Days of

3423
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:56,520
Future Past.

3424
02:47:56,520 --> 02:47:58,520
And

3425
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:00,520
apparently

3426
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:02,520
it doesn't show Mega Man as deceased

3427
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:04,520
or apprehended so

3428
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:06,520
people think

3429
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:08,520
maybe download content

3430
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:10,520
like that. That'd be a real dick move but

3431
02:48:10,520 --> 02:48:12,520
hey whatever.

3432
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:14,520
They could make some extra money via download

3433
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,520
content. You know the moment they put them up for

3434
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:18,520
download that everyone's gonna get it.

3435
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:20,520
It's gonna be instant money maker cause everyone

3436
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:22,520
wants Mega Man. And roll.

3437
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:26,520
And then last but not least

3438
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:28,520
of course we talked

3439
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:30,520
a little bit about Nintendo

3440
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:32,520
patents earlier and now

3441
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:34,520
Sony has actually patented

3442
02:48:34,520 --> 02:48:36,520
biometric controllers

3443
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:38,520
for, well obviously

3444
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:40,520
and also for the handhelds as well.

3445
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:42,520
And not really sure what this would be used for

3446
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:44,520
but kind of think of like

3447
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:46,520
maybe

3448
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:48,520
some stuff to do with

3449
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:50,520
maybe

3450
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:52,520
some of the stuff you saw with

3451
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:54,520
the vitality sensor

3452
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:56,520
or they have the Ubisoft energy thing.

3453
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:58,520
Basically reach your

3454
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:00,520
blood pressure, heart rate and that kind of

3455
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:02,520
stuff. So maybe for exercise programs

3456
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:04,520
or something like that they may have a special

3457
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:06,520
controller attachment for

3458
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:08,520
like a move controller or something like that that

3459
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:10,520
would feed into that so you could see

3460
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:12,520
if you're exercising at the

3461
02:49:12,520 --> 02:49:14,520
right level or whatever. I just want to jump in

3462
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:16,520
for live listeners. It looks like we're streaming

3463
02:49:16,520 --> 02:49:18,520
again. Once again we had an internet outage

3464
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:20,520
unfortunately. I really appreciate you guys

3465
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:22,520
sticking with us through our downtime. Again

3466
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:24,520
this is out of our hands.

3467
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:26,520
Why would we purposefully cut you guys off?

3468
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:28,520
That would be ridiculous.

3469
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:30,520
Well trust me. I've been dealing with this for

3470
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:32,520
the last three days and it's a pain in the ass.

3471
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:34,520
Playing MMO is not fun.

3472
02:49:34,520 --> 02:49:36,520
Unfortunately we're doing our best through

3473
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:38,520
this. We are getting another call though. I guess people can see

3474
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:40,520
that we're back up even though I'm still

3475
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:42,520
waiting for the chat room to catch up

3476
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:44,520
and get us. We are getting calls again.

3477
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:46,520
Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

3478
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:48,520
Hi this is your friendly

3479
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:50,520
neighborhood Mexican. Act Deaf. Hey how you

3480
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:52,520
doing Act Deaf? It's good to hear from you.

3481
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:54,520
Yeah I'm doing pretty fine

3482
02:49:54,520 --> 02:49:56,520
I guess. What's up? What's on your mind?

3483
02:49:56,520 --> 02:49:58,520
First of all

3484
02:49:58,520 --> 02:50:00,520
I want to talk about

3485
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:02,520
something to say about Sonic Generations

3486
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:04,520
on PC. I have

3487
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:06,520
inflated but it's cheaper

3488
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:08,520
on Steam. You know and

3489
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:10,520
we mentioned that on the show

3490
02:50:10,520 --> 02:50:12,520
but of course you guys didn't hear it because of our

3491
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:14,520
downtime. But yeah it sounds like it's

3492
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:16,520
a more reasonable price on Steam right?

3493
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:20,520
Are you still there Act Deaf?

3494
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:22,520
Yeah I'm here.

3495
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:24,520
Oh okay. It sounds like it's a more reasonable price

3496
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:26,520
on Steam then right?

3497
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:28,520
Yeah it's like

3498
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:30,520
$3 so. So did you buy it?

3499
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:32,520
Yeah.

3500
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:34,520
Oh what do you think of Sonic

3501
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:36,520
Generations?

3502
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:38,520
Like I said I haven't played it but

3503
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:40,520
many people have talked pretty good about

3504
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:42,520
it so I may get it

3505
02:50:42,520 --> 02:50:44,520
if it's cheaper on

3506
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:46,520
Steam's holiday sale.

3507
02:50:46,520 --> 02:50:48,520
That's kind of

3508
02:50:48,520 --> 02:50:50,520
where I'm at is that like if it's on Steam

3509
02:50:50,520 --> 02:50:52,520
then I'm just going to wait for the Uber sale

3510
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:54,520
that comes later on and get it then.

3511
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:56,520
So we'll

3512
02:50:56,520 --> 02:50:58,520
see. What else have you been

3513
02:50:58,520 --> 02:51:00,520
playing lately? What have you been playing

3514
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:02,520
if you haven't been playing Sonic Generations?

3515
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:04,520
I have been playing

3516
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:06,520
Bastion. Oh

3517
02:51:06,520 --> 02:51:08,520
Bastion's cool. Have you been playing that

3518
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:10,520
on the PC or 360 or what?

3519
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:12,520
Yeah PC.

3520
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:14,520
Right now my 360 is broken

3521
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:16,520
so I can't play

3522
02:51:16,520 --> 02:51:18,520
on it so. But I

3523
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:20,520
remember it was they were having like a $5

3524
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:22,520
sale on Bastion or

3525
02:51:22,520 --> 02:51:24,520
something like that this week on Steam.

3526
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:26,520
$5 I think. Nice. I got it as a gift.

3527
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:28,520
It's a birthday gift. Oh very

3528
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:30,520
cool. Well what do you think of Bastion?

3529
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:32,520
I haven't played it a lot

3530
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:34,520
but I have played

3531
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:36,520
it's pretty good. It's pretty

3532
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:38,520
addicting. It

3533
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:40,520
reminds me of old school Zelda

3534
02:51:40,520 --> 02:51:42,520
or old school adventure RPGs.

3535
02:51:42,520 --> 02:51:44,520
What do you

3536
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:46,520
think about that narrator

3537
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:48,520
that's in the game that has to talk about

3538
02:51:48,520 --> 02:51:50,520
everything as you're playing through it?

3539
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:52,520
I don't know. I liked

3540
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:54,520
it. It's a pretty nice addition.

3541
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:56,520
It makes you feel like you're

3542
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,520
playing it with someone

3543
02:51:58,520 --> 02:52:00,520
and it's

3544
02:52:00,520 --> 02:52:02,520
telling you the story like

3545
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:04,520
no no I liked it. I don't know if

3546
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:06,520
anyone hates it or

3547
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:08,520
doesn't like it. It definitely is kind of

3548
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:10,520
one of those things where you feel like the story is unfolding

3549
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:12,520
as you're kind of playing it

3550
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:14,520
which is pretty cool.

3551
02:52:14,520 --> 02:52:16,520
Yeah. But a lot of people

3552
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:18,520
say that that's also like the gimmick of the game.

3553
02:52:18,520 --> 02:52:20,520
That's this big gimmick is that you know

3554
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:22,520
without the whole narrator thing it's not

3555
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:24,520
really a big deal.

3556
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:26,520
Probably.

3557
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:28,520
It would be

3558
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:30,520
pretty bland I think but yeah

3559
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:32,520
the narrator adds something

3560
02:52:32,520 --> 02:52:34,520
to it that makes it more appealing.

3561
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:36,520
And the soundtrack to that game

3562
02:52:36,520 --> 02:52:38,520
is great too.

3563
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:40,520
Yeah I may feature it on the

3564
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:42,520
future. I love that song segment.

3565
02:52:42,520 --> 02:52:44,520
Oh there you go. I love that idea.

3566
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:46,520
Hey I got to play this for you. This is a parody that

3567
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:48,520
was making it's way around the internet this week. I don't know if you guys

3568
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:50,520
saw this but this is the Bastion

3569
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:52,520
narrator. Well it's not really him

3570
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:54,520
but somebody impersonating him doing his take

3571
02:52:54,520 --> 02:53:20,520
on other video games.

3572
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:27,520
And what's funny is that that's like

3573
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:29,520
really what playing the game is like.

3574
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,520
Yeah.

3575
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:33,520
So that's a pretty good parody. I like that. Good job.

3576
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:35,520
I'll watch it later.

3577
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:37,520
It's really funny.

3578
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:39,520
It's on this website called Dorkly.

3579
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:41,520
I don't know if they're just hosting the video. No they're awesome.

3580
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:43,520
They put out a bunch of weird stuff like that.

3581
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,520
Nice.

3582
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:47,520
Awesome. Well act deaf. Anything else you want to share

3583
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,520
on the show before we let you go?

3584
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:51,520
Probably a question for Loki

3585
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:53,520
about

3586
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:55,520
the 360s right now.

3587
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:57,520
Alright. Loki?

3588
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:59,520
Dude

3589
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:01,520
is there going to be any special

3590
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:03,520
or price deduction for the 360?

3591
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:05,520
I want to get one for Christmas.

3592
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:07,520
So I don't know if it's going to

3593
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,520
still be $200 or it's

3594
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:11,520
going to get cheaper. They're not going to announce

3595
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:13,520
any price drops.

3596
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:15,520
You know if anything

3597
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:17,520
they just have the holiday bundles

3598
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:19,520
right now which you know for like a

3599
02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:21,520
250 gigabyte system

3600
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:23,520
I think they've got Fable 3 and

3601
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:25,520
Halo Reach in there.

3602
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:27,520
You will see some cutthroat

3603
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:29,520
deals going on Black Friday as

3604
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:31,520
well like we're already hearing about retailers

3605
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:33,520
that are probably going to offer the system

3606
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:35,520
and it won't be a price reduction so much

3607
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:37,520
but like that you'll get a free $50

3608
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,520
or even a $100 gift card

3609
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,520
with the game when you buy this

3610
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:43,520
excuse me a $100 gift card when

3611
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:45,520
you buy the system and I can't remember what

3612
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:47,520
retailer was rumored to be doing that. Was it Toys R Us?

3613
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:49,520
Toys R Us says that sometimes.

3614
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:51,520
You know keep an eye out for those Black

3615
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:53,520
Friday ads because you're probably not going to see

3616
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,520
a price reduction on the system itself but

3617
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:57,520
you'll see these other little deals to try

3618
02:54:57,520 --> 02:54:59,520
and get you to go buy the system there.

3619
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:01,520
And you know when you're talking a $100

3620
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:03,520
gift card that could be

3621
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:05,520
a pretty big thing. Of course I know

3622
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:07,520
you're in Mexico but you

3623
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:09,520
come up to California

3624
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:11,520
to take advantage of some of those sales

3625
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:13,520
sometimes right?

3626
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:15,520
Yeah sometimes though

3627
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:17,520
I get my bonus until December

3628
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:19,520
so you might also

3629
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:21,520
be able to take

3630
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:23,520
advantage of that. Well it

3631
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:25,520
may not be restricted to Black Friday

3632
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:27,520
you never know. Sometimes dealers

3633
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:29,520
want to kind of keep that movement

3634
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:31,520
going through the rest of the year especially

3635
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:33,520
retailers like Amazon

3636
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:35,520
Best Buy Online

3637
02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:37,520
Target just you know try to be informed

3638
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:39,520
and keep an eye out. This is one of those times

3639
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:41,520
I would really recommend a site like CheapAssGamer

3640
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:43,520
because they

3641
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,520
their big niche is

3642
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:47,520
rounding up all these ads so

3643
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:49,520
keep an eye out when it's time and I'm

3644
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:51,520
sure somebody will be offering the deal because they're going to try

3645
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:53,520
they're going to try and get them out the

3646
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:55,520
door. Yeah I think so.

3647
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:57,520
We have a named chatter. I hope that

3648
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:59,520
there's a brief

3649
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,520
go ahead

3650
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:03,520
near the hallway

3651
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:05,520
so

3652
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:07,520
AGM409 in our chatroom says keep

3653
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:09,520
a look on at SlickDeals.net

3654
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:11,520
suggest that

3655
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:13,520
too. So

3656
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:15,520
I think we might be losing the internet again

3657
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:17,520
we are so unfortunately

3658
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:19,520
that brings the ActDeaf call to a close

3659
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:21,520
ActDeaf I don't know if you can hear us

3660
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:23,520
but thank you so much for your call we really appreciate

3661
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:25,520
it

3662
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:27,520
Is that it? Did the internet go down completely

3663
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:29,520
again? Yes it did. We lost the show

3664
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:31,520
again. Again!

3665
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:33,520
Sorry! It's not your fault

3666
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:35,520
It's just Comcast. It's frustrating

3667
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:37,520
but I know it's not your fault. It's because of the rain.

3668
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:39,520
It does this every

3669
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:41,520
year you know. Right when the rainy

3670
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:43,520
season starts and it gets cold

3671
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:45,520
It gets cloudy and the cables like

3672
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,520
ahhhh clouds!

3673
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:49,520
It just seems to do this

3674
02:56:49,520 --> 02:56:51,520
like when it starts getting hot and when it starts getting cold

3675
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:53,520
It's irritating

3676
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:55,520
but I'm not mad at you. It's redonk

3677
02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:57,520
I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the situation

3678
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:59,520
Alright well any other

3679
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:01,520
last minute stories to get out before we wrap it

3680
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:03,520
up? Someone's developing

3681
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:05,520
a My Little Pony MMO

3682
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:07,520
that's disturbing

3683
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:09,520
I have a new story

3684
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:11,520
Yesterday was my mom's birthday. Happy birthday

3685
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:13,520
to my mom. That's not news

3686
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:15,520
Hey

3687
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:17,520
I love my mommy

3688
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:19,520
And then

3689
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:21,520
also apparently Gearbox

3690
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:23,520
being awesome. There was a

3691
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:25,520
guy that was a Borderlands fan

3692
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:27,520
who died of cancer

3693
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:29,520
at the age of 22 and so

3694
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:31,520
Gearbox actually

3695
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:33,520
did a eulogy

3696
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:35,520
as Claptrap and also

3697
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:37,520
this kid will

3698
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:39,520
be featured in the next

3699
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:41,520
Borderlands game as an NPC

3700
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:43,520
which is kind of cool

3701
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:45,520
Well that's

3702
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:47,520
a nice gesture. That's always

3703
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:49,520
really nice to see the companies do that for

3704
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:51,520
you know

3705
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:53,520
people when they die

3706
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:55,520
that were important. Especially if it was really before

3707
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:57,520
their time

3708
02:57:57,520 --> 02:57:59,520
Well I guess is that it for

3709
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:01,520
last minute stories?

3710
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:03,520
Yeah that's pretty much it

3711
02:58:03,520 --> 02:58:05,520
Unfortunate. Alright well

3712
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:07,520
unfortunately we're missing a Skype line right now

3713
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:09,520
I feel really bad especially for those guys

3714
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:11,520
that tune up live but again

3715
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,520
out of our control. Well that's the part of the show

3716
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:15,520
where we go around and get everybody's final

3717
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:17,520
thoughts and wrap things up

3718
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:19,520
so I will say

3719
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:21,520
this. I'll start with this of course once again guys

3720
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:23,520
thanks for tuning into our show and supporting

3721
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:25,520
Orange Launch Radio even when we're having crazy

3722
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:27,520
internet downtime and so forth. We really

3723
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:29,520
appreciate it. It means a lot to us

3724
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:31,520
If you like what you hear all we ask tell a friend about

3725
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:33,520
the show. Word of mouth is so important

3726
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:35,520
we just want to build our community and grow

3727
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:37,520
stronger and maybe

3728
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:39,520
find some people that work for the cable company who

3729
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:41,520
can make sure our internet connection stays up. Who knows

3730
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:43,520
Let's go

3731
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:45,520
around and get everybody some final thoughts for the night

3732
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:47,520
DarkSakura do you have any final thoughts

3733
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:49,520
tonight? We go to print this week

3734
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:51,520
I have

3735
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:53,520
a seven page research paper due

3736
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:55,520
this week

3737
02:58:55,520 --> 02:58:57,520
Next week

3738
02:58:57,520 --> 02:58:59,520
I

3739
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:01,520
will probably not cry so much

3740
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:03,520
I'm about ready to go

3741
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:05,520
Loki do you have a final thought tonight?

3742
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,520
I will be playing Saints Row the

3743
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:09,520
third this week at some point

3744
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:11,520
That's my goal at least

3745
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:13,520
Hopefully sooner rather than later

3746
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:15,520
If not I'll play Saints Row 2

3747
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:17,520
on PC

3748
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:19,520
My final thought tonight is

3749
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:21,520
A. I'm really bummed about

3750
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:23,520
the internet going down but I guess

3751
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:25,520
the one silver lining about it is that

3752
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:27,520
means we're going to finish up early just

3753
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:29,520
in time for peepers

3754
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:31,520
Alright

3755
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:33,520
that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio

3756
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:35,520
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our

3757
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:37,520
show we really appreciate it

3758
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:39,520
Did it just come back up?

3759
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:41,520
Well we'll come back up in time for folks to hear the credits

3760
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:43,520
Have a wonderful night everybody we'll see you next

3761
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:45,520
week hopefully with less

3762
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:47,520
internet lulls. Good night everyone

3763
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:49,520
