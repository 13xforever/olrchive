1863	5444	All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.
5984	7785	Up next, Orange Lounge Radio.
10045	13046	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
13726	16027	Orange Lounge Radio.
16147	19468	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.
19708	20668	Okay.
27401	37284	Tonight, November 27th, 2011, a special connect for Windows is detailed, one group of people want Skyrim to be banned, and is Sony planning an answer to Smash Bros. ?
45168	50314	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
50594	52396	Orange Lounge Radio.
52856	61486	We are live at All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
62187	64990	www.allgames.com if you want to tune in to listen.
65510	67532	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
86711	87652	I'm almost full.
87992	88212	Yeah?
89033	95077	I made lamb leg with parsnips in the slow cooker.
95437	98780	And then I took the broth, so it's got all that good meat fat in it.
99000	100661	Food, food, food, food, food, food.
100721	102422	And cooked quinoa in it, so now my quinoa's creamy.
102683	108106	Now, I notice in your other hand, you have an old friend of the show who's been gone for like several years.
108327	109287	He ran away to die.
109427	112490	Makes his triumphant return to the show tonight.
112510	114391	Are you going to say hello?
114411	114511	Hello?
114893	117313	Yeah, but this is going to break your heart, or my heart anyway.
117474	120794	All right, here we go.
121174	122014	Oh, he's working now.
123135	126875	He was going... Oh, and I pressed it earlier.
126895	131236	It's the OLR ferret, the official orange laundry... Oh, God.
132096	134377	He's not doing healthy after all these years.
135717	137037	He might need to have an operation.
137077	139398	You might have to open up his butt and replace the battery.
140973	143175	Well... Oh, but look at that face.
143195	146197	The Orange Lounge Radio ferret is slowly dying, ladies and gentlemen.
146737	149299	Just like the quality of this program.
150620	151281	Say hello as well.
151301	152281	He's gonna model my quinoa.
152962	156364	I don't know why you're bothering to take a picture of it because we have no website right now, but hey.
157425	158286	The flicker still works.
158326	158687	That's true.
158707	159568	The flicker still works.
159648	160809	Get it up there for when it comes back.
161390	165775	Joining us as well, hopefully not about to soon die.
165795	167196	He'll be with us for a long, long time.
167256	168758	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
168998	171762	Yeah, you can replace the batteries in those by cutting the stomach open.
172422	173663	I did that one time.
173683	175743	Remember we had like four ferrets at one time.
175863	176284	I do.
176684	177484	I don't know where they went.
177524	180425	You came into the show one time and you were like, hey, Jamie, here.
180505	182046	And you threw like five ferrets at her.
182086	185327	And I held them all the entire episode because they were my babies.
185367	190309	We mailed one to one of our friends in Colorado, Rai Chan.
190509	193370	I don't know if she still listens, but she's out there.
193631	197512	And I think we gave another one to a longtime OLR listener.
197532	199513	Didn't one of them get stuck to a Katamari?
199693	200453	Thanks for watching!
218403	218943	DarkSakura.com
236269	256461	but thankfully so around 4 o'clock that day we just had to make a decision like okay well we can't even really tape a show without internet because we use internet to get our stories and to do some of the other incidental background music and stuff so we couldn't do a show period so we said eh we'll just take the week off anyway it's right before Thanksgiving so whatever a lot of shows are going to be off
257981	261922	We're back here tonight to news that we don't have a website right now.
263682	267063	I know when you go to orange.com, it says something about an account billing issue.
267103	268303	That's actually not the issue.
269143	271344	It's not something as obvious as Rob didn't pay the bill.
272684	274064	It's the man bringing us down.
274164	274465	It is.
275065	275705	It's SOPA.
275805	277025	It went into effect, everybody.
277085	280026	And unfortunately, because we play music during the show.
280046	280546	No, it's not.
281986	282326	It's the 1%.
283987	284508	It's the man.
285889	286769	No, here's the thing.
286849	292793	Our website space has been graciously donated for the past... When did we move off of my personal domain?
292813	294114	It was about seven years ago.
294234	295815	So, I mean, it was a long, long time ago.
296175	296835	We were on live 365.
296875	298316	Let me put it that way.
298336	299117	So it was a long time ago.
299657	300178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
314774	342365	and unfortunately when things break because we don't pay for it that doesn't mean things get fixed right away so we have to understand that you know beggars can't be choosers so he is aware he's working on it don't pester him about it he knows and I know he's working really hard to try and fix it one way or another even if that ends up meaning we have to kind of get web space somewhere else so keep an eye on our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook and we'll let you know what's going on with the website as we know
342945	348330	Unfortunately, this does mean that it affects the podcast folks because without a website, we can't deliver the podcast.
348650	352113	So the only people here in this show right now are our live listeners.
352553	359019	And it probably won't make the feed tonight, which is unfortunate because we've been on a really good track record of getting the show up for the Monday morning crowd.
359099	361341	And sadly, it won't be there for them tonight.
361361	362982	But we'll get it up as soon as we possibly can.
363242	367166	So hopefully you podcastees will be listening to this before too long.
368046	368166	So...
371016	372037	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
395333	400475	Honestly, if that's too difficult, just go to chat.allgames.com and they'll point you in the right direction.
401236	406458	And my apologies to the fine folks at All Games Chat, but they'll understand, I hope.
407398	412541	So anyhow, before we get into our gaming weeks and all that, I thought we could talk a little bit about this.
412561	414501	It's something I kind of wanted to talk about last week.
414541	415682	We didn't end up having a show.
416202	416682	Sorry.
417023	418003	It's not your fault.
418443	419284	Just things happen.
420764	422165	We'll talk a little bit about charity.
422625	422925	Waffle Irons
438604	439445	Waffle irons for $2?
439505	440566	Waffle irons for $2 you say?
440606	443808	Yes, just try not to get clobbered with one.
445009	448792	You see the YouTube of all them people fighting over $2 waffle irons?
448852	449813	It's quite a sight to behold.
449833	450473	That's stupid.
450574	451975	You want to hear something else that's stupid?
453756	461942	We got back after having Thanksgiving dinner with our family and we came home and we're like, crap, there's like nothing to do.
462363	463303	Let's watch TV.
463884	467026	Hey look, Lady Gaga's having a Thanksgiving...
468027	468547	Special.
468647	470468	I didn't see it, believe it or not.
470648	472328	She made waffles with salami.
472848	474189	I wouldn't say she made waffles.
475109	481751	A chef that makes food for her was making waffles with salami in them.
482571	484471	That's weird, but I'd try it.
487032	489212	Were you tempted by Gaga's delicious waffles?
489533	490113	I think you were.
491173	493234	Waffles are good, but it was weird.
493274	493894	Waffle Gaga.
496263	497063	Lady Woff Woff.
498564	499585	That sounds kind of dirty.
499685	500385	It does a little bit.
500445	500685	All right.
501065	502206	So anyhow, charity.
502346	502706	Hello.
503367	504447	Going back to charity.
505468	513552	I know Child's Play is obviously one of the biggest gamer charities, and they've kicked off their official donation season during the holidays.
513572	515853	There's been a lot of stuff going on, like Desert Bus.
516914	519315	Gosh, this has been, what, the fifth year I think that's been going on?
519935	524817	If you don't know what Desert Bus is, I don't think you've been following a lot of the gaming internet stuff, but we'll explain it anyway.
525698	529439	There's this game that came out on... God, what system was Desert Bus on?
529459	530560	Was that a 3DO game?
531040	534502	It was on some obscure-ish system, wasn't it?
534522	536002	That was on the Sega CD.
536022	538544	That was part of the Penn & Teller game.
538804	539664	That was on the Sega CD.
539704	540304	Was it Sega CD?
540364	543806	It was Penn & Teller's Smoke & Mirrors.
543866	545587	I knew it was one of those CD systems I didn't have.
545647	547628	And you drive a bus for like...
548308	548889	The whole thing.
549390	558821	And the deal is, you drive a bus from LA to Vegas, but don't expect the graphics to look like, you know, Burnout or something.
558841	562125	Wasn't the whole thing is that they hate video games or something, so they made a video game?
562486	562786	Yeah.
563647	563848	Yeah.
564588	564749	So...
566418	567819	Something about the realism or something.
568159	571941	Yeah, and you really drive the actual distance.
572021	573221	It's not abbreviated.
573601	577003	And you're not allowed to drive above a certain mileage because you're driving a bus.
577403	579924	So to drive from one to the other takes like four hours.
580984	589067	And you can't just rubber band the button down or anything because every so often you have to slightly adjust your steering or the bus will go off track.
589188	591288	Yeah, because the alignment's not correct.
591408	591849	Exactly.
592189	595050	So when you make it all the way, you score one point.
596821	597822	It Takes Like 4 Hours to Do So
618701	619181	DarkSakura.com
643251	643571	DesertBus.com
662594	675546	Which is nice because they actually donate all the proceeds for the iOS 1 to the Child's Play charity And I want to say, wasn't that the one where Penn Jillette actually ended up donating money?
676347	683253	I don't think it was this year, I think it was last year or something He donated quite a bit of money, like he actually knew about it So, it's kind of neat
685393	687274	So anyhow, lots of charity stuff going on.
687615	693899	So, you know, think about some of that money you saved on all those, you know, Black Friday sales or Steam sales or so forth.
694239	695881	Think about giving it to a good cause.
695921	701044	And even if that cause is not child's play for you, maybe it's, I don't know, St.
701064	707089	Jude's Hospital, March for Babies, American Red Cross, whatever the charity is.
707569	712953	Although about the American Red Cross, though, keep your money out of, you know, those guys...
713829	716890	ringing the bells in front of retail stores.
716910	717650	The Salvation Army?
717670	718330	Yeah.
718390	718870	Not a fan?
718930	720631	I thought that was Red Cross, but Salvation Army.
720671	726852	Yeah, don't give them any money because, especially now, I guess they're taking credit cards as well.
727512	737175	I mean, do I really want to slide a credit card through a skimmer that they may have so that I can hopefully get the money going to them and not some crook?
737395	739195	Just do it through online if you're going to do that.
739878	742780	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio, not necessarily.
742800	743500	All right, anyway.
744441	747642	Well, actually, they have caught a number of scammers.
748443	749664	Just be careful.
750644	751485	Always be careful.
751505	752325	Get a receipt.
752385	753366	Do it through the websites.
754646	763592	Or just do Desert Bus or Umlaut, because those are two ones we know, or Child's Play themselves, and those are several different ones we know are reputable and all that.
764412	776646	Alright, anyhow Let's move on, let's talk about video games And how was your gaming week The video games you've been playing this week I don't know about you guys, but I've played a ton So let's go around the table, start with DarkSakura Ladies first
777350	782152	Well, I actually played some stuff while my internet was sort of working.
782513	784994	I actually played a lot of droplets, Rob.
785034	787295	That's that random-ass puzzle game that's on Steam, huh?
787435	788315	Yeah, it's actually pretty funny.
788936	789156	Funny.
789256	790056	Fun, I should say.
790076	796819	I don't want to say it's like Pipe Dream, but it does involve pipes and water going through, but it's all like they're falling.
796839	797520	But you've run out of drops.
797820	798080	Yeah.
798440	821450	and you have to collect them in your reservoir and get more and you can actually get little pockets that will open up that you can get more drops and so you get a score as long as you have drops to play with actually I have to look at my Steam list because I have to look at what I was like I actually played a bunch of Portal 2 as well just you know again while my internet was not working
821803	822464	Do the Humble Indie Bundle
841163	859018	I don't think they have a bundle going on right now there's a different type of bundle we're going to talk about a little later in the show but as far as the gaming bundle there's nothing right now but there probably will be one soon enough those have been doing very well so we'll see
860120	867663	I was also playing some Doom 2 and playing Peggle Extreme.
867743	873004	I tried to play Magicka, but while my internet was down, it was like, no, you can't play this game.
873605	877866	And then a few people actually all gave me the same game.
877886	880387	They gave me Fallout New Vegas.
881187	882508	Gee, tough problem.
882948	885469	Wait, wait, several people bought you Fallout New Vegas?
885509	886730	I know it was on sale earlier this week.
886750	887431	I guess so.
887871	889091	Was it on your wish list or something?
889672	890632	I think it might have been.
891073	891873	Ah, there you go.
892413	896155	I mean, I can look, but yeah, Fallout New Vegas is actually really sweet.
896195	905401	I put up a couple of screenies from... I can pull up my Steam account and show people a few screenies, but I mean...
906521	926119	I had never really had much of an interest in playing it, but when I started playing it, it really... I had friends that played the RPG and kind of seeing their books and seeing how the game set up, it actually kind of seemed like the same, you know, had the same feel, except then you're, you know, first person.
926239	927240	Or you can play third person.
927320	928341	You can play behind the shoulder.
929262	931544	So I didn't actually get as bad motion sick as I might have.
931977	932298	RedHair
945460	945941	DarkSakura.com
963275	966617	And if you don't know what game they did, they're the folks behind Darwinia.
966957	973459	So Darwinia is in this bundle, as well as Uplink, Defcon, Multiwinia is all in this.
973500	979122	And if you pay more than the average, which right now is $3.75, gosh, that's so low.
979522	981903	I would hope you'd pay at least like $10 or $20 for this.
982944	986345	Aquaria and Crayon Physics Deluxe get thrown in as well.
986565	987766	So there is a bundle going on right now.
987806	988446	My apologies.
988996	989356	I don't know.
989597	992239	How much longer is that going for?
993540	995682	Is that like just tonight or is that going into next week?
995742	996083	Let's see.
996583	997484	Eight days left.
997624	998064	Oh, shit.
998084	999025	So you've got some time there.
999626	1000607	You got at least another week.
1000647	1002989	Usually if you wait to the end, there's more stuff tacked on.
1003650	1004630	Looks like they've already done it.
1004971	1005631	All right.
1005731	1009795	And even if you buy early, you still get the extra stuff that they end up adding.
1010095	1013639	And what I really like about the way Humble Bundle does it is that you get steam codes for everything.
1014079	1038909	so like I bought it and then I just loaded it all into Steam the last time I bought one which was the bundle that had VVVV in it so yeah pretty cool oh yeah I've actually played more than oh yeah I did play WoW for the record I'm working on my rep with the Shatari Skyguard good times so I can fly around on a fat short manta ray there's a birthday party going on in WoW right now
1040126	1041367	Oh yeah, that thing.
1042488	1045191	It messes up my look, Rob.
1046532	1048354	And just a little quick side note.
1048514	1048694	What?
1048875	1053179	Whoever that freaking Tarin was that was killing all my birds, DIAF.
1053799	1054080	The end.
1055143	1056624	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1059705	1063186	And this is going to be continuing on because we're not playing Grand Theft Auto anymore.
1064207	1065447	We're playing Call of Duty now.
1066308	1067408	This is weird to me.
1067528	1068649	Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
1068809	1069889	I'm still kicking ass, though.
1070930	1072370	And you know what?
1072570	1073771	You've turned into a bro.
1074191	1074871	No, no.
1075772	1080014	It's been, what, like less than a week and I'm already trying to mod the game.
1080294	1083495	So I'm working on a mod for Call of Duty.
1086118	1089821	Dan's yelling from the other room, make it not suck.
1090381	1095004	I have a tangent about bros I want to talk about in a minute.
1095024	1095804	It's been pretty fun.
1097045	1104730	We're playing hardcore mode because they don't like the fact that I can kill faster if I have a map and I can see where people are firing from.
1105111	1107412	I'm still killing pretty fast anyways.
1108413	1108713	We're just
1109093	1109673	Thank you for watching!
1130666	1133527	But yeah, I am working on something actually kind of unique for it.
1135028	1151215	Just like some special balance mod thing where each class would have different weapons and a special ability kind of like a button or something that you would have a one minute ability that would be like god mode or invisibility or something like that.
1151655	1154536	And then with a five minute cooldown for each thing.
1154596	1159418	So it's really intricate, but you can actually program quite a bit and call it to you, which is kind of cool.
1159978	1161299	So I'm going to mess around with that.
1162580	1165102	Actually, hopefully I'm going to mess around with Grand Theft Auto mods at some point.
1165122	1167483	Because I've just been really distracted by everything.
1168184	1169324	I've played Saints Row.
1169404	1170745	I've pretty much beat Saints Row.
1170925	1172747	Actually, I have beat Saints Row almost 100%.
1174428	1179331	All the side missions and stuff were done except for the car thefts.
1179751	1182573	And those are really annoying because it's really glitched.
1184074	1188057	The one I was on now, apparently every time you go into the zone to steal the car...
1188797	1189758	Thanks for watching!
1204870	1206210	For the most part, I have everything done.
1206250	1223475	I just have to play through the game again to finish some missions in a different way, like Act 1, finish that in a different way, and then also the third act I have to finish, or Murder Brawl, I have to do that a different way.
1223615	1230097	Did the Tron parody stuff in Saints Row end up being good, or was it just kind of... Yeah, that's pretty much what you saw in the video.
1230117	1231497	They had some interesting stuff.
1232137	1234578	There's even a little bit of Zork in there.
1235189	1235570	Awesome.
1235890	1237011	Do you get eaten by a Gru?
1237632	1239494	No, there's actually a text adventure part.
1239934	1240275	Awesome.
1240315	1244359	You have to do a little bit of stuff there.
1244919	1246101	But it's pretty awesome.
1246481	1250025	Do you end up in front of a house and there is a white mailbox here?
1250934	1251654	Something like that.
1252414	1257236	It's a parody of it, so you have to go kill a unicorn, is what it is.
1258276	1259297	Damn you, unicorns!
1260537	1274281	So there was something with that, but what's kind of cool, though, is the perks that you get from beating that portion of the game is you actually get one of the combat tanks, and you get to drive around the city and fire it, and it has all the sound effects from combat, which is great.
1274421	1275821	It's a big, blocky tank.
1276242	1277162	And then they also have...
1277662	1278082	Thanks for watching!
1299677	1300757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1328743	1329343	I'm afraid.
1329443	1331885	She'll be wearing all black and kill things with fire.
1332805	1333105	Okay.
1333946	1334986	I kill things with fire.
1335006	1336447	I approve of the killing with fire.
1337328	1342530	But yeah, because what's great about it is you can actually go into the... Well, you can go on the website.
1342550	1344772	She should have a giant menorah she whaps people with.
1345672	1347193	I would not do that to my menorah.
1348293	1349314	They don't have that.
1351635	1354477	What's kind of cool, though, is you can go on the website and...
1354997	1355417	Thanks for watching!
1373486	1376368	I've got so much I'm trying to play right now anyway.
1376388	1377509	I can use another one.
1377529	1378930	But you really should play Saints Row the Third.
1378950	1383373	I really do want to play Saints Row the Third, especially knowing that somebody else made my damn character.
1383393	1384153	It is awesome.
1384393	1385734	But it actually turned out really good.
1385794	1386055	It is.
1386395	1388416	I saw the pictures and I'm like, that's cute.
1389057	1389977	It's such a great game.
1390758	1395141	Seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it.
1395161	1397682	I did play it for over 30 hours because I got that achievement.
1397702	1398163	30 and 30.
1398203	1398783	3 and 30, I guess.
1403666	1405168	and play over 30 hours of the game.
1408250	1412513	So yeah, aside from that, I've been playing Skyrim, which is great.
1412533	1423502	I almost gave it up pretty quick because the first time I played the game, something glitched out and I went to the first town I'm supposed to go to and everyone started attacking me, trying to kill me.
1423642	1423902	I'm like...
1425203	1426344	Okay, what the fuck?
1426384	1429726	I can't do anything because you guys keep trying to attack me.
1430146	1431768	Except for the one character I was supposed to talk to.
1432028	1434169	He was fine, but everyone's trying to kill me.
1434249	1437932	I'm like, okay, I don't understand why you have to piss everybody off.
1438032	1444476	So I finally tried it again, and I'm really enjoying it because now it's actually working correctly.
1444496	1447138	You might have accidentally murdered somebody.
1447898	1448439	Maybe.
1448699	1450840	Maybe I hit somebody with a sword.
1451000	1453582	Maybe I decapitated somebody and forgot.
1454583	1454843	Oops.
1456204	1465729	Well, like I had something earlier that I ran into, like I decided to go exploring off and then I see this giant attacking these two people, so I'm going to go help them.
1466090	1468271	So I, you know, start shooting fire at the giant.
1468431	1473274	So people started coming and attacking me because I guess some of the splash damage started hitting them.
1473634	1476136	Like, you fucking idiots, you know, so what?
1476236	1477296	You got injured a little bit.
1477376	1478557	I killed the giant for you.
1478757	1487720	For such an enormously enormous game, like a game as vast as Skyrim, it does really have its derpy moments.
1489581	1494002	There's some real things in Skyrim that just don't make sense.
1494042	1499045	Like, it should be like, if you do a little bit of damage to somebody, they're like, hey, you know, don't do that, or something.
1499185	1514074	And then if you continually do that, then they should start attacking you, but not just like, oh, I accidentally dealt a little bit of damage to you, or like, oh, you ran in front of my arrow, or something like that, and unfortunately you got stuck with an arrow.
1514735	1522379	They should have a little bit of like, you know, kind of, hey, stop that, and then start attacking you if you keep attacking them.
1523380	1531069	I think that'd be a little bit better than, you know, oh, I accidentally hit you with a fireball because I was aiming at the troll that's right next to you or something like that.
1531950	1537236	Anyways, um... I like some of the lulzy stuff people have done with Skyrim Online, like the house full of cabbage.
1537837	1537957	Yeah.
1540958	1559268	I had to fight, once again, exploring because I'm trying to get enough money to buy these booths to allow me to pick up more things, which is ironic because I got the money, the amount of money that was in the game to do that, and all of a sudden I go back down to buy them, oh, and now they're more expensive.
1559369	1561670	I'm like, fuck you, I'm not buying those anymore.
1562190	1562691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1580070	1603433	so I was like ah shit these things look magical that's not good so I killed them and then it was the Wisp mother that was there started shooting like some ice thing at me and so I decided to go try to kill her and that took about 15 to 20 minutes to actually take her down because I'm such a low level character yeah but they level with you so it would have taken 15-20 minutes anyway
1604864	1605104	Really?
1606105	1615111	You do get a little bit of edge because of the talents and so forth that you get, but unfortunately the enemies, it's not like a Final Fantasy where if you just grind, grind, grind, you'll be able to overpower everything.
1615131	1615831	It doesn't work like that.
1615851	1620154	But anyways, so yeah.
1620234	1628719	Honestly, in any Elder Scrolls game, you should just do the main story first, so that way you can just do it when it's easy and then go back and do open world lousy fun.
1629600	1630441	Maybe we should do that then.
1630461	1632582	That's the way to approach an Elder Scrolls game, I really think.
1633348	1650614	Um, so yeah, so I, it took me about 15 minutes, but it's funny because, you know, you were saying the house full of cabbages and stuff, and the game's not exactly realistic, like, at one point, because I had a bunch of stuff from crafting things, either, you know, making food or making, uh, you know, alchemy and stuff like that.
1651034	1656436	So I got to the point where I had exhausted my potions that I had with me, and I'm like, crap, I need more health.
1656896	1660137	So, like, I ate, like, 13 pounds of food at one point.
1661398	1661658	Like,
1662738	1663279	Level up.
1663879	1666180	Your skill in pooping has increased to 21.
1667261	1668182	It's just ridiculous.
1668242	1671544	It's like, okay, here's this two-pound cheese wheel.
1673105	1675426	This will give you two health.
1676167	1678408	I'm going to eat four of those.
1679389	1686193	I can imagine this guy, like, high minor rock just shoving his mouth full of, like, cabbage and carrots and, like,
1686833	1711105	you know raw rabbit and just all sorts of ridiculous stuff that you happen to be carrying with you and I also found another way it was kind of fun um I was really sad because remember how they had the thing where oh you can steal from people by putting pots over people's heads I thought there was only a pc until I figured out you have to hold a and then you can move shit around and I was like oh thank god it doesn't work though I haven't gotten it to work at all
1711885	1712645	Maybe there's a trick to it.
1712685	1713186	I've never tried it.
1713206	1713706	Which is too bad.
1714086	1729251	But it allowed me to, you know, because one of the things I kind of do is I pick up everything that, you know, is not attached, which is great because, like, you do, like, missions for people and stuff and all of a sudden they become, you know, friendly with you and they'll just let you take everything.
1729311	1740495	Like, I did a mission for the guy at the trading post or whatever and after that, it's like everything in the house allowed me to take it almost except for, like, expensive armor and stuff.
1740635	1745316	Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.understandsradio.com disagrees with me on what I'm saying about the level scaling.
1745416	1748217	Saying the enemies don't really level with you anymore in Skyrim, Rob.
1748577	1751717	They changed it due to people not liking it in Oblivion.
1751757	1752998	It's more like Fallout now.
1753078	1753378	Really?
1753938	1758179	I could have sworn somebody was telling me that they were playing the game twice and saw the difference.
1758299	1762060	But maybe it's not as much of a weight as it was before.
1763800	1764140	Who knows?
1766301	1768702	I like being able to overpower everything, personally.
1769983	1770623	I hope that's true.
1771463	1772564	I haven't played enough Skyrim.
1772664	1775165	I really haven't because I've been distracted by so many other games.
1775585	1778706	I probably will not give Skyrim proper attention until Christmas time.
1778726	1782467	Skyrim's hilarious because at one point I was like, oh, hey, wait a second.
1783288	1784168	I can swim in the river.
1785123	1790247	I'm diving underwater and I'm catching salmon for no apparent reason other than I can.
1791028	1793810	That's the whole thing about Skyrim.
1793950	1795611	I don't know why I'm doing this.
1795892	1796432	I can.
1797093	1798133	Or Skyrim with the physics.
1798374	1802397	Hey, you can go along this mountain trail or you can just walk straight up the mountain.
1802897	1805159	Just hit jump a lot and you'll eventually climb the mountain.
1806511	1807131	That's what I do.
1807611	1811752	But yeah, I found out that if you're carrying too much, obviously it slows you down.
1812112	1818014	So what you can do is you can grab one more object by holding A, and it'll just hover out in front of you, and then you just run back to town.
1818394	1826656	You know, of course, if you get to any doorway, you'll pick it up, take it in your inventory, walk through the door, drop it, and pick it up again using the hold A thing, and just keep on running.
1827496	1827896	It was great.
1828016	1829737	I was able to take one... I brought you a pen!
1830937	1832497	I was able to take one more battle axe.
1832537	1833857	How stupid must that look?
1837432	1839793	Bobby has joined chat to try and clarify.
1839853	1842635	Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf who tapes before us live at All Games Radio.
1842975	1843876	Try and clarify.
1844296	1846598	Bring a little clarity to the rim of Sky.
1847398	1849299	Sky says, here's how it works.
1849520	1851141	Or Blackwolf says, Sky, here's how it works.
1851481	1855003	When you first enter a dungeon area, it generates the enemies to your level.
1855383	1860607	If you leave that dungeon, go level up and go back in, they will be the same level they used to be.
1860807	1863469	So you can overpower them, but not on the first entry.
1863749	1864830	Now that makes a lot of sense.
1865670	1866391	Here's what you need to do.
1866471	1868512	You need to find all the dungeons at level one.
1869173	1873035	Like I'm saying, go do the story mode right away.
1874496	1877178	I'm going to, but I get distracted so much.
1877478	1877759	I know.
1877919	1878899	I hear you.
1878999	1886645	Seriously, I have taken everything in that town, the first town, the Riverwood, whatever, and I've taken everything that has not been bolted down.
1886985	1887325	It's great.
1887345	1888966	There's so many glitches in the game.
1889026	1891208	Did you fill a house with cabbage?
1892219	1894881	I don't have a house to fill with cabbage yet, but I have a lot of cabbage.
1894901	1895922	Well, damn it, now you have a mission.
1895942	1898605	And I've eaten a lot of cabbage too, so that's not good.
1899746	1901547	Anything else about your gaming week?
1902548	1903829	We could talk about Skyrim all night.
1904310	1904770	Seriously.
1904830	1914679	Like, for example, one of the tricks you can level up any skill by those people that will actually tell you, like the first town you go to, there's an elf there that will help you improve your archery.
1914919	1918122	Well, if you invite him into, you can invite him to, you know,
1918602	1920063	Join you and he'll come and help you.
1920123	1927226	So you go and you pay for that and then you go, I need to trade with you and you take your money back and then you pay him again and take your money back.
1927286	1936391	In fact, the other thing is you can take his house key for no apparent reason or just take all of his inventory and then you go to his house and steal everything.
1936411	1939493	And then go to the middle of the forest and say, okay, wait here.
1941408	1942548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1963237	1963757	Thank you for watching!
1982104	1983185	How about bitch?
1983405	1984565	Yeah, she's a really tough bitch.
1985025	1989107	And then on top of that, you kill her and she doesn't really die.
1989367	1992428	She just comes back to life again and starts fucking trying to kill you again.
1992468	1993909	She might be integral to the story or something.
1994189	1997591	You probably can't kill people that keep you from completing the actual story.
1998871	1999431	I don't care.
1999451	2000112	I know.
2000352	2000832	I know you don't care.
2001195	2003596	Just finish the story then go do whatever you want.
2003636	2004376	Whatever you want.
2005096	2006617	Burn a whole village down for all I care.
2006777	2007577	Then wait for the DLC.
2008437	2008657	Alright.
2009217	2010298	Anything else for your gaming week?
2012579	2013319	A little bit of Zuma.
2013719	2015439	That's it.
2015519	2016080	Let me move on.
2016260	2017720	I got some games I want to talk about.
2017840	2018520	I've played a lot.
2018700	2023022	I can only talk about some of the games I've played this week because I've played a lot in the past couple weeks since we last had a show.
2024062	2029186	So let me start with the one I've probably played the least of, which is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2030127	2032028	I bought this more for Alan because he wanted it.
2032068	2034470	And keep in mind, we didn't own Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2035191	2038833	It's like we knew that they were going to release a new version just nine months later.
2039214	2041175	So we ordered that over Amazon.
2041375	2042436	They always do.
2042696	2043057	I know.
2043597	2044838	I know that for next time now.
2044918	2048321	So I'm going to be wary about buying Capcom games when they first come out.
2048501	2052564	I'm going to have to be convinced they're not going to release an Uber edition six months later.
2053124	2056647	So it's really my first taste of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at all.
2057868	2065133	The controls are weird because I guess they took more of a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom direction with them.
2065334	2066074	Not a fan.
2066294	2068356	Much easier if you've got the arcade controller.
2069006	2069947	Yeah, I could see that.
2070047	2070607	I could see that.
2071487	2074909	So I'm not a fan because I like my games like Street Fighter, but that's okay.
2076209	2077490	The art style is really good.
2077950	2081111	It's so fun to play on like an HDTV with awesome sound.
2081992	2083392	The graphics and everything look great.
2083512	2085333	Lots of great characters.
2086173	2089235	Some weird choices, especially on the Capcom side, but okay.
2089715	2090936	No, Rocket Raccoon.
2091656	2093637	No, I said on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.
2093657	2094297	That's Marvel.
2094937	2095878	Rocket Raccoon is Marvel.
2096258	2096458	I know.
2096818	2099739	I say weird choices on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.
2099799	2100820	Right, but that's a weird one.
2101020	2101880	Yeah, it is weird.
2102641	2102961	I hear you.
2103001	2103601	That's what I was saying.
2103641	2104942	I thought you liked Rocket Raccoon.
2104982	2106062	I do like Rocket Raccoon.
2106102	2107403	It's just sort of out of the blue.
2107603	2107903	Yeah, yeah.
2108303	2109904	So there are some weird choices in there.
2110244	2113305	But, you know, it can't all be, you know, totally mainstream.
2113325	2114626	That's kind of part of the fun of it.
2116187	2118167	So, yeah, I've just done some light skirmishes in that.
2118267	2119688	Very difficult game, too.
2119728	2121689	The difficulty's even on very easy.
2121769	2122649	It can be a pain in the ass.
2123070	2126311	Alan was screaming at the TV trying to beat Galactus, or at least, you know, kind of.
2126933	2129545	He doesn't really scream at the TV but just in his irritated way.
2129826	2130128	Flick.
2130208	2130771	Yeah, I know, right?
2132508	2134750	So yeah, that was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2135790	2138792	I bought a game on Steam that was dirt cheap last week.
2139132	2141714	Not during this whole autumn sale they've been doing, but last week.
2141734	2147938	They had a game called Magicka on sale for like $2.50, and you could even download the demo.
2148418	2153761	Or no, you downloaded the full game, and you could just play the full game for free through Sunday.
2153801	2155482	This is the kind of stuff Steam can let you do.
2156303	2158144	So I ended up buying the Uber edition for like $9.
2158304	2159825	It comes with all the expansions.
2159885	2160625	I liked Magicka.
2160665	2161066	It was cool.
2161086	2161486	It's kind of like...
2162026	2162586	Thank you for watching!
2179994	2180554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2198824	2201525	So it's interesting kind of learning about the combinations.
2201905	2204806	So exploration definitely plays heavy into this.
2205246	2211307	This is the game as well, and I know we talked about this on the show a while back, but it had some very strange expansions.
2212708	2215769	Like the first expansion for Magicka is Magicka Vietnam.
2217109	2237010	and it's the little magic characters in Vietnam and the joke is because all the shooter games end up having a Vietnam expansion so Magicka got a Vietnam expansion there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheekness the game is very tongue-in-cheek it's sharp-witted I think it was right after they announced the Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam expansion
2239085	2243308	So, yeah, so I was... And then they did some other expansions after that.
2243388	2247770	So, yeah, I enjoyed Magicka, and it was fun to play.
2247810	2248851	You can play it online, too.
2249091	2253234	Like, Alan and I were doing co-op in the same room over Steam online.
2253254	2253834	It was pretty fun.
2254174	2256776	So you can play, like, I think up to four or six people at once.
2257016	2260799	And there's all these other modes I haven't even touched yet because, again, other games have distracted me.
2260819	2261259	But there's, like...
2261979	2264641	Challenge Modes, and PvP, I guess is a big element.
2265482	2269085	Because I got the Uber Edition, I got all these different Magicka types.
2269565	2272987	And what's funny is that one of them is like a Tron dude.
2273348	2276070	They all wear the little hooded robe things.
2276110	2277050	They look like little monks.
2277371	2281554	But this particular monk has the energy lines and carries an energy disc, right?
2282014	2283995	And I played that when I was playing online with Alan.
2284075	2284856	He couldn't heal me.
2285236	2286357	And we couldn't figure it out.
2286397	2287478	Why the hell can't you heal me?
2287518	2288699	I can heal you, but you can't heal me.
2289259	2294563	Well, it's because since I was playing as Tron dude, you don't heal me with life, you heal me with lightning.
2295504	2297786	So whenever he would shoot a lightning bolt at me, I would heal.
2297906	2304231	So just funny little quirks like that were in the game and kind of lead to the puzzle elements of Magicka.
2304831	2305772	So, um...
2307134	2308997	Out of everything out right now, you're playing that?
2321232	2325837	So we went to Evil G one day because we had a gift card we had to spend.
2326057	2331363	So we found a game that was the perfect amount of money and it was White Knight Chronicles 2.
2331603	2332344	I was there.
2332364	2333044	It was on sale.
2333144	2333705	Yeah, you were there.
2333725	2334306	You did come with us.
2335487	2342214	White Knight Chronicles 2 we bought on sale for $40 and it comes complete with the first game, which I did play a little bit before.
2342854	2349804	When it was actually done by Sony, but now this game has been out in Japan and Europe for a while, but D3 finally put it out here.
2349864	2354591	Because I guess the first game didn't do so hot, but it has a real cult following to it.
2355071	2356113	So now the second game's out.
2356914	2358096	It's a lot like...
2358416	2385415	the .hack games on PS2 you can play the first game all over well actually you couldn't even do this in the .hack games because they didn't come with each game but imagine if like the first .hack what .hack infection and the next one like imagine if they were bundled together you can either start the first game which is what they called the remastered version although I call it the they made the annoying text box slightly less annoying and a couple other little things you probably won't notice
2386471	2388356	or you could just start the second game at level 35.
2390242	2391163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2419600	2419820	DarkSakura,
2439222	2446786	It's not a bad game, but it's just a... It does a lot of things, but none of them are best in class.
2447246	2450527	It's like a game that gets straight Bs across the board.
2450547	2456770	The story's not really in A. The graphics are pretty good.
2457090	2459672	The music's good, but it's not great.
2459712	2462133	The character design, it's neat, but there's a lot of repetition.
2462833	2468656	It's like it gets straight Bs, but he put it all together, and it makes for a really deep experience.
2468936	2469817	It's like Xanadu.
2470257	2470818	I guess.
2471719	2473160	I don't know, but yeah, I can't stop playing.
2473200	2474782	I'm just like grind, grind, grind, grind.
2475162	2479306	I could be playing Skyrim, yet I'm playing this game because it's like I have to beat story mode.
2479546	2480347	I have to get to level.
2480447	2482049	I have to get to the White Knight Chronicles 2.
2482509	2484091	I have to be able to play with people online.
2484171	2484971	I can't stop playing.
2485952	2508270	a couple other negatives I'll say about the game really disappointed that there was an online store mode where you buy things for your village like houses and scenery but this stuff will impact the amount of stuff that you can grow which in turn is what's for sale at your stores so that's my long way of saying you can buy your way to a competitive edge in this game
2508930	2530558	and it's not just that but they actually sell items at the Sony store that are like this coupon is good for 20% increased experience for one week so there's a lot of like really cheap stuff like that and I almost want to flunk the game on those grounds alone however I do have to realize there is this online component that they're not charging money for
2531278	2536742	that does have about the depth of Phantasy Star Universe, and Phantasy Star Universe does still charge money to this day.
2537122	2538803	Why they just don't go free-to-play, I don't know.
2539243	2549230	So I give it a slight pass on those grounds, because I feel like, okay, well, fair enough, they are providing a robust online component, they gotta make the money for that somewhere, I guess.
2549910	2553612	But I do frown on the fact that they sell things to give you a competitive edge.
2553933	2557615	That shit is just... As a gamer, it bothers me.
2558616	2560317	I don't like it in other games, too, so...
2562081	2568983	Let's see, Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, wait, White Knot Chronicles 2 has both games?
2569283	2571904	I'm going to tell a friend that wants it to get that instead of the first one.
2571984	2572604	Oh, absolutely.
2572865	2574885	The first game is pointless at this point.
2575485	2578406	Like, if you can get it $10 used, awesome.
2578986	2582087	And you can import what you do in the first game into the second game.
2582448	2583148	You can do that.
2583608	2586629	You don't have to just start at level 35 because the level cap in the first game was 50.
2587289	2589410	So, you grind your way to 50 and then do it that way.
2589470	2589930	But, uh,
2590630	2593372	Yeah, there's really no point, and this game's probably not that expensive.
2594393	2599656	White Knight Chronicles 2 was $40 on sale, but that was a pre-Black Friday type sale.
2599696	2601637	When did we go to Evil G, DarkSakura?
2602137	2603338	Was that like Wednesday?
2603638	2605660	I think so, yeah.
2605680	2605980	I think so.
2606560	2609461	You can probably find it used even cheaper like somewhere else.
2609721	2610001	Maybe.
2610261	2615183	But be careful because it has an online pass called GeoNet.
2615423	2622465	So you can't do any of the online features without the – you get the one free with the new copy and then it's going to be $10 otherwise.
2622545	2623005	It was Sunday.
2623685	2624225	Sunday morning.
2624425	2626786	That's right because the show didn't happen.
2626866	2627026	Yeah.
2627366	2627646	Okay.
2628006	2630787	But we went in the morning because I was running away from the football game.
2631027	2657153	yeah yeah so anyway White Knight Chronicles 2 straight B's yet I can't stop playing it go figure and then here's a game that I've also been playing a lot of and it's Super Mario 3DS and I gotta say I'm just gonna be blunt this is my favorite Mario game in the past 20 years I think for real like I think this is my favorite Mario game since like Super Mario World I think
2658073	2659674	Um, it's great.
2660034	2664316	Like, if you own a 3DS, I don't know why you would not get this game.
2664617	2669519	Like, I seriously do not know why you would be a Nintendo supporter and not want Mario 3D Land.
2669679	2671220	It is outstanding.
2671600	2673621	The level design is fantastic.
2674081	2680425	There's a lot of throwbacks to a lot of things you see in the Mario series, as well as some new stuff, like the whole Boomerang Mario.
2681225	2706144	um but yeah I mean I can't stop thinking about the level design the level design is so good they're linear levels like what you would see in a Mario game yet they have that slight openness of like Mario 64 yet they're not too damn open like I think some of the levels in that game and even like Galaxy and Sunshine were like there definitely is that Mario linear path to it um
2707245	2707485	How's the 3D?
2729244	2730925	Believe it or not, it's neat.
2731225	2741912	I was not the biggest fan of Mario 64, and I've taken shit for that on this show over the years, and a lot of that was because I didn't like the transition from 2D to 3D.
2741972	2747396	Mario 64 was one of the first big 3D games, and I realize a lot of people disagree with me on that, and that's fine.
2747716	2748957	Every gamer gets their own opinion.
2749557	2751519	So I was a little worried about this at first, but...
2752319	2762008	I think because the levels still feel somewhat linear-esque to me, but still have a sense of openness to them, I'm not bothered by the 3D at all.
2762148	2766091	And the actual 3D effects are cool.
2766792	2769694	And they're with purpose in some places.
2770115	2776060	And there's some kind of puzzle rooms, for lack of a better term, that you actually kind of use 3D in.
2777361	2778682	Can you play it in 2D?
2778882	2779182	Yes.
2779742	2780583	Would it look as good?
2780823	2781063	No.
2781463	2782344	It doesn't look as good.
2782564	2784485	So you think they've really got the hang of the 3D now?
2784745	2805577	I do, and I'll tell you one thing I love, love, and I think all the 3DS games need to do this, is they have a switch now that not only can you adjust the intensity of the 3D, but with the switch of the D-pad, if you press the up arrow, then the 3D is up, like it's outward 3D, whereas if you hit the down arrow, it's inward 3D.
2806477	2806937	That's cool.
2806957	2809278	That may not make a lot of sense the way I'm saying it.
2809558	2809758	No.
2809958	2812258	But when you play it, you'll see what I mean.
2812558	2815759	It's instead of one will project, the other will immerse.
2816079	2816359	Yes.
2817139	2820560	And this can help some of the effects, like depending on your eyes.
2820980	2833463	Like sometimes I notice if I'm playing the projector 3D, there's these stages where these spiked ball things will kind of swing back and forth, like out.
2833783	2838387	Well, sometimes the 3DS does this thing where when they swing forth, your vision starts to split.
2838427	2839248	Get the ghosting.
2839308	2843251	Yeah, you see the ghosting and all that, but if you do the inward 3D, I don't see that at all.
2843831	2851718	That's probably how I would have to play the whole thing, given that every other thing I've played on a 3DS, I get the problem all the time.
2851918	2855201	You can kind of choose what 3D works for you.
2856242	2856362	Okay.
2858829	2863815	So, let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and looking at some comments here.
2864275	2867218	DDR Dollar Bill says, please tell me it's not like Mario 64.
2867799	2869000	It's not like Mario 64.
2869180	2872084	In my opinion, it's better.
2872284	2874706	And there's going to be a lot of people that disagree with me on that, and that's fine.
2876488	2880449	Let's see, SJ100Matt says, Rob, you're not the only person I've heard say this.
2881930	2886892	Let's see, Actdeft says, I liked Super Mario 64, but I get why people don't like it.
2887272	2889773	Heck, my favorite Mario game is still Super Mario World.
2890234	2890814	Mine too.
2891514	2893375	Mario 3D Land is not without flaw.
2894616	2897839	For instance, the street pass stuff is weird.
2898319	2908726	Like, you have these mystery boxes that are very similar to the Toad Houses where if you can clear a mystery box in like 10 or 15 seconds, you might get a chance at a bonus coin.
2909127	2916052	And I guess the deal with is that if you street pass with people, all it does is it's like they give you a new mystery box.
2916552	2920335	And it's not necessarily one that they've played or I don't think it really is anything but...
2920715	2923596	Hey, you got a little bonus because you street passed with someone.
2923716	2927018	So that's kind of a little like, boy, that seems somewhat forced.
2927898	2935802	So to that, I say derp derp, but it doesn't really detract from the single player game experience, which is still great.
2936722	2942585	I mean, street passing will allow you to get more bonus coins, I think, which will allow you to get some of the levels and stuff.
2943205	2946407	But if you're really good at single player, you could still do it.
2946972	2950795	You know, one week from today, Mario Kart 7.
2951295	2951595	I know.
2952576	2957720	See, there's been a lot of skepticism about the 3DS, and rightfully so.
2958400	2963424	Because this game blows any of the launch titles out of the fucking water, including Street Fighter 4.
2963464	2964785	Yeah, they launched with this?
2965706	2966967	They should have launched with this.
2967827	2970049	Now, maybe there's a method to the madness.
2970309	2975353	Maybe they didn't want to have the sellouts, which would seem weird for Nintendo, but maybe they wanted to launch it early.
2976193	2993154	and have this slow build, I don't know or maybe they legitimately thought it would launch heavier than it did, but if this game can't sell the 3DS nothing will it's as simple as that if the 3DS, if this game does not carry 3DS sales
2995209	2996850	There really is nothing else they can put out on it.
2997630	2998550	I truly believe that.
2998650	3001191	This Mario game is about as good as a Nintendo game gets.
3001771	3003792	It's better than Galaxy.
3004152	3005472	It's better than New Super Mario Bros.
3005492	3005672	Wii.
3005772	3006452	I really think so.
3006693	3007873	Is it better than Sunshine?
3007893	3009333	Because Sunshine was pretty epic.
3009953	3011034	Yes, it's better than Sunshine.
3013462	3014923	No shine, get!
3014983	3016645	Some people think Sunshine was ass.
3017145	3018326	I think it was a lot better.
3019146	3025391	I don't get how you can like Mario 64 and hate Sunshine, but I guess it has to do with the whole water element, but whatever.
3026052	3028033	I actually like 64 a whole lot.
3028333	3033257	I like 64, but I don't think it's... I like this game better.
3033577	3033998	I really do.
3035883	3051498	this is going to be one of the best games of the year period this is a great year for games like I'm seriously sitting back going how can I choose between Mario 3D Land Portal 2 and Skyrim which one of these games is the best game of the year because they are all fucking good like really fucking good
3052239	3054401	and there's some games I haven't even touched yet.
3054881	3059344	I'm hearing amazing things about Zelda Skyward Sword, which I'm sure a lot of us are.
3059404	3064528	I don't think any of us in the room, oddly enough, have touched that yet, but I'm hoping to get my hands on it before the end of the year.
3065109	3066350	There's a lot I still haven't played.
3066570	3067911	This has been a great year for games.
3068131	3068991	It really has.
3069452	3078679	Thankfully, as far as releases go, aside from Mario Kart 7, there's no real big major releases in games until the end of January.
3081380	3102867	so you got a few weeks to catch up on some stuff at least so Salacious Pop in our chatroom says Sunshine was pretty terrible to be honest but I also hated 64 I didn't see his thoughts on this one but I can tell you since we're playing on the same cartridge he's been playing quite a bit he's about as far in the game as I am so I'm thinking he's liking this one
3103527	3127805	so I'm hearing there's a lot of stuff I don't want to like spoil things more than I probably already have but I hear there's a lot of stuff you can kind of unlock if you do really well in a lot of levels and I think that's great it kind of gives the game some value and obviously there's the coins that you can go back and get and so forth but I get the sense that unlike you know 64 where you had to play the same level over and over to get the stars and all that like if you miss
3128806	3148969	if you don't get a single coin in the damn game I think you can still beat it I think you can still fight Bowser and beat the game but you will miss like 10 bonus levels you'll miss the chance to unlock the extra gate you know there's just I think there's a lot to build for so anyhow
3150305	3164305	yeah good gaming week and I still have to play more Skyrim I really do and then after the Civilization sale on Steam the other day I was like we need to have another Civ night so anyway it's a great time to be a gamer it really is
3164909	3167550	Well, I have one more little thing.
3167770	3170891	Sure, what do you want to throw out there before we get into some gaming news?
3171091	3176592	Well, when you were talking about Umlaut, I forgot to mention that I designed the badges and tickets this year.
3177492	3181533	So everyone needs to go and hold on to my work forever.
3182374	3190976	So your graphic design chatter on this show is not for naught because now your stuff is actually going to be a part of this gaming event.
3190996	3191456	That's really cool.
3191761	3193842	Yeah, and no, you don't get a preview, everyone.
3194202	3195723	You know, I can't show anybody.
3195943	3197324	Yeah, you have to go to the event and find out.
3197524	3198324	Rob's seen it, though.
3198424	3200626	Well, I can't say anything about it.
3200646	3201586	Go to the show and find out.
3201766	3203007	You can tell them it looks good.
3203127	3204568	Yes, it looks very professional.
3204708	3205008	It does.
3205128	3205988	It looks very professional.
3206028	3218515	And I think I don't know how much I can and can't say on air, but I will just say, understanding the source material, you did a really good job making everything consistent.
3220316	3221677	and kind of putting your own spin on it.
3221717	3223058	So I think that's awesome.
3223579	3224800	That was the goal, branding.
3224820	3225220	Yeah.
3225240	3225881	That was the big thing.
3226261	3232686	But it was actually really fun to do and probably one of the fastest I've ever gotten anything accomplished.
3234448	3242934	But yeah, so for people who actually can't make it, they'll be up on my portfolio after the event's over.
3242954	3243235	Okay.
3244216	3248280	I'm supposed to be doing something as well, but I don't think I'm at liberty to say yet.
3248520	3252445	I haven't seen... Once the official word is out there, I'll be able to say something.
3252725	3253686	So that's all I can say.
3253866	3256129	But I really hope you're going this year.
3257150	3257751	Everyone be there.
3257991	3260033	If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you really should go to Umlaut.
3260113	3260754	Fly out.
3262055	3262436	Join us.
3262916	3263196	All right.
3264677	3265478	Quick housekeeping.
3265658	3267759	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
3268120	3271202	Follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3271282	3272863	And hey, we're now on Google+.
3273403	3277666	That happened, the show we weren't at last week, but we are now on Google+, as well.
3278426	3283850	Unfortunately, Google did not smarten up and let you have a custom URL, but it's really easy to find us on there.
3283910	3291355	Just in your little Google Plus search box, look for Orange Lounge Radio, and it'll probably pop up by the time you get Orange and L in there, so...
3292359	3295477	Keep an eye out for that and Plus One Us and all that stuff on Google+.
3296331	3297632	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
3297652	3300293	We're like, what, an hour into the show with all the games that we played this week?
3300373	3301834	Let's actually get into some gaming news.
3302214	3309137	It's actually a good thing we spent an hour talking about gaming weeks because our show is a little bit abbreviated this week because of the website problems.
3309177	3310978	We don't have quite as much news as usual.
3311338	3316921	And it is also a slow news week because, you know, it's been a big holiday here in the States.
3317321	3318802	There's a few big stories we're going to get to here.
3319582	3322684	I will say also, though, look forward to this in Part B tonight.
3323144	3325766	Listless returns in Part B tonight.
3326126	3328628	We love to fill slow news weeks with OLR games.
3328908	3331370	So Listless coming up tonight in Part B. Okay, sorry Loki, your turn.
3331890	3343019	Okay, so Sony is reporting that the PlayStation Move has shipped 9 million units and a million of those have been over the past half year.
3343639	3347362	Of course, there's a lot of funky math when you go to look at this.
3348342	3351324	One, it's unit ship, not necessarily sold.
3351605	3359990	And two, unlike... You can't compare this to the Kinect, where Kinect is a solid unit, and that's all you need to use the Kinect.
3360330	3365734	The Move has multiple components, so you can have up to four Move controllers per system.
3366194	3371718	And I'm not even sure if they're counting the navigation controllers or whatever else to go along with that.
3371858	3372018	So...
3373619	3375460	Who knows what that necessarily means.
3376361	3377742	9 million move units shipped.
3379363	3379703	I don't know.
3380084	3382065	But, hey, it's not bad.
3382145	3386108	I mean, 9 million is a good number, even if it is, you know, 4 per system.
3390011	3390451	Alright.
3391091	3391832	I mean, I don't know.
3391932	3394354	It's just doing better than I thought it was.
3396355	3396835	Not bad.
3398577	3399477	Ours is hooked up now.
3399497	3400278	I haven't played it yet.
3401368	3404132	I still have the Move controllers, but I actually have no Move.
3404152	3411683	Well, aside from LittleBigPlanet 2 obviously supports it, but I don't have any Move required games yet.
3412904	3415188	But I don't really play my PlayStation 3 that much either.
3415248	3417190	That's why I loan out all my PlayStation 3 games.
3417947	3418407	Outro Outro Outro
3434861	3437363	Well, you know what I'm going to be playing a lot of in the next few days?
3438344	3439205	Sega Saturn!
3440746	3441086	Why?
3441506	3442147	Christmas nights.
3443328	3443848	Oh, that's right.
3443888	3445630	I forgot that's like your yearly little thing.
3446450	3447171	Your fun thing.
3448292	3448672	All right.
3449853	3456098	Well, as far as the move goes, though, do you think the move is a wash at this point?
3456458	3459481	Or do you think they're still going to try and breathe some life into it?
3460821	3473810	Um, I think that it, there's still plenty of life to be brought into it because after all, um, they could, I mean, they're, they support it in most of their first party games.
3474370	3489921	Um, you know, like Resistance and Killzone and, uh, SOCOM all support the move and plus, you know, they have a lot of, um, games coming out that are going to be supporting, that are pretty big like, you know, Bioshock Infinite is going to be supporting the move.
3491061	3497344	I think that they do have a good grasp on how to use the move with hardcore games per se.
3498104	3500386	Better than the Kinect, that's for sure.
3500426	3509049	I'll give Sony props for that because the way that they've done Kinect support for the hardcore games, if you will, like Halo and Forza 4...
3510510	3530636	it sucks it's terrible I mean head tracking sounds like a good idea not implemented very well at all and voice commands and halo no it's stupid it's absolutely terrible do you think it's because the Kinect didn't end up being hardware wise what it should have been like it should have been a better camera in there
3531485	3532927	I don't even know if that's the case.
3533608	3537834	Really, if that is the problem, couldn't they revise the heart?
3538615	3540498	Wait for the next Xbox at this point.
3540718	3542881	I don't know.
3543522	3545605	I guess it could have been better, but
3547120	3548841	Sopa Stop Online Piracy Act
3570149	3573271	If you're not aware, basically there is an act that's being explored.
3573291	3585100	It hasn't passed yet, but it's one of those things that's going through the committees, which means it likely could go for a vote even before possibly Congress takes a break for the holidays coming up in December.
3585760	3590564	And in short, the Stop Online Piracy Act will allow the government to force...
3591204	3620559	internet service providers to basically blacklist websites make it unable to access websites domain names based on the fact if they are offering infringing material or not you know what they're trying to stop is they basically want to shut down things like the Pirate Bay like that'll be one of the first things that gets thrown up there is that they'll block that domain so that you can no longer pirate if you've been using that site you know videos and movies and so forth and so on
3621199	3624601	Um, but this is causing a lot of controversy.
3624841	3628923	And, um, the fact is, it's kind of like how they are censoring things.
3629683	3635867	And well, a, a lot of people are saying straight up when you talk censorship of the internet, it's like, dude, this isn't China.
3636247	3637407	Why are we censoring the internet?
3637627	3638648	Blocking websites?
3638988	3640529	That's, that's, that's a China thing.
3640589	3641389	That's what they do there.
3641509	3642330	Why are we doing this?
3643831	3661944	and, you know, obviously what they're trying to do is stop piracy but unfortunately, you know, this act, I feel, kind of leaves it very vague because my understanding is that if a company were to complain that this website is offering infringing material, that website could just get shut down.
3662979	3663540	Hold on a minute.
3663960	3666001	We have something here in this country called due process.
3666061	3668443	Well, actually, I believe they do.
3668543	3671686	It's not as simple as they complain about.
3671806	3677970	I think it does actually have to go in front of a judge to say, okay, here's our evidence that this site's doing that.
3678330	3681633	But it's not just sites that have pirated material.
3681793	3686316	It's sites that they claim facilitate finding that.
3686777	3689819	So like Google, for example.
3690319	3696043	And Pfizer's behind this because it's also targeting websites that sell, like, fake Viagra.
3696163	3698005	Pfizer's the drug company that created Viagra.
3698625	3704770	And, you know, how much spam mail do we get every day about go to this Canadian pharmacy website that sells Viagra or whatever it is?
3704790	3707351	Yeah, but we're still going to get that spam.
3707412	3708392	I mean, that's not going to go away.
3708893	3711835	God, if it was going to get rid of the spam, that would be awesome, but no.
3712215	3714557	There's a couple ways – and why –
3715205	3734592	I didn't even really get to the story, I was giving the background on this A lot of gaming companies have come out actually in support of this Like Nintendo's in support of it, I believe Microsoft finally came out First they weren't, now they are Sony's in support of it, a lot of the game companies Hollywood loves it, Hollywood wants this Hollywood's the one trying to push this through Hollywood's trying to push it through
3735706	3736206	Sopa needs to, quote,
3757992	3765677	Balance key innovation, privacy, and security considerations with the need to thwart the threat rogue websites pose.
3766298	3768359	Also, quote, And I totally agree with this guy.
3789073	3789713	Thanks for watching!
3806038	3807218	That's not what we do here.
3807698	3808238	You know what I mean?
3808538	3808758	Yeah.
3808838	3813799	Like, I'm really torn because whereas I'm like, okay, if they want to stop piracy, they have a right to stop piracy.
3813839	3815380	Well, they can't really stop piracy.
3815400	3821261	What they're doing is they're just blocking access to these sites because these sites operate in countries that don't have the same piracy laws as we do.
3821641	3827402	So really, as far as jurisdiction goes in the U.S., there's nothing they can do about it other than block them.
3827462	3827822	That's it.
3828262	3835163	And what's great about this, you know, act, because you can obviously tell that the person that drafted this is really...
3837204	3839345	It only blocks domain names.
3839485	3840686	You know what domain names are, right?
3840706	3844788	They're just basically easy ways for you to remember an IP address.
3845129	3846850	It's your cell phone book.
3846870	3852273	Seriously, in this day and age, how many people actually have all the numbers in their cell phone book memorized?
3852893	3853433	Very few.
3853953	3855054	You might know your parents.
3855114	3857094	You might know your significant other, but that's about it.
3857875	3860455	I don't know my significant other's phone number.
3860836	3861176	I don't.
3861376	3862316	And here's the thing, though.
3862356	3862776	That's okay.
3862796	3865017	I don't know your significant other's phone number either.
3865057	3865977	It's in my phone.
3866537	3866777	Okay.
3867097	3869078	There's a bunch of things that they're assuming to be true.
3869138	3877861	First off, these websites or whatever, obviously if they feel that they're going to be threatened or taken down or whatever, they're just going to give you the IP address.
3878021	3880302	You type in the IP address, boom, you're at the website.
3880382	3881022	It's not blocked.
3881482	3886388	I think at the end of the day, you have to hold these websites responsible and that's the only way to stop the problem.
3886428	3888090	But it's not that easy because they're not all in America.
3888110	3888810	Here's the problem though.
3902846	3921025	much like piracy and stuff they're going to try all these things to try to stop piracy but all it's going to do is hurt other people and not necessarily get rid of the piracy problem the problem is just like everything else with piracy just like we've seen time and time again
3921685	3925807	Every time they've tried to do something, such as let's say Ubisoft DRM, right?
3925847	3927928	You're not connected to the internet, the game shuts down.
3928428	3929989	Pirates had it cracked in two days.
3930289	3931830	Who did that shit ultimately hurt?
3931970	3933051	The legitimate users.
3933371	3937393	And that's going to be the problem with SOPA, is that the pirates will find their way around it in two days.
3937873	3939094	Who's gonna ultimately get hurt?
3939415	3952789	The legitimate users who are trying to access a website like allgames.com who suddenly got yanked because, I don't know, fucking Namco or somebody didn't like that they were playing the music from a 25-year-old video game or something, you know?
3953971	3956794	Like, legitimate people are gonna end up getting hurt.
3958015	3958796	That's the problem.
3959096	3972850	And if it's anything like, you know, I've read kind of these horror stories about some file sharing sites where, you know, Warner Brothers, they were sending cease and desist basically for files that weren't even their properties.
3972930	3976053	It just happened to have, like, names of their stuff.
3976854	3979156	Part of the title was share their name.
3979196	3980978	I called my hard drive Batman.
3981391	3983232	So Warner Brothers wants to shut me down.
3983372	3984693	You know, something like that.
3984793	3986935	Or, like, you know, even, like, YouTube.
3987175	3993079	Well, YouTube videos now, I mean, obviously, that they can pull it if, you know, there's a complaint or something like that.
3993119	3997242	But it's just going to be really hard for them to do it.
3997302	4001724	And I just have a feeling that even if this law passes, I don't think it's going to do anything.
4002185	4003205	Did those, like, what was it?
4003245	4006848	The digital, I don't even remember what the hell it was.
4007168	4009654	The Millennium... I know what you're talking about.
4009674	4011438	Yeah, basically the DVD copying thing.
4011639	4013884	Did that stop people from copying DVDs?
4014365	4014586	Nope.
4015608	4015889	Nothing.
4016089	4016290	So...
4017825	4021006	People find a way around it, and it's just, it's unfortunate.
4021566	4025067	If you don't like the direction these folks are heading in, it's time to vote them out.
4025507	4042312	Because, you know, I gotta admit, I'm sitting here going, I understand where this might be an issue or whatever, but I can think of a lot of things that are a bigger issue right now, and that is like, you know, I don't know, the fact that the whole country's going down the shitter, and people are very upset about that, you know, the whole thing.
4042852	4042972	And...
4043812	4046074	I get the... Watch out, Rob, you might get pepper sprayed.
4046734	4048356	And then locked into a detainment camp.
4048376	4050417	We do live just down the street from UC Davis, you know.
4051198	4053720	Not literally down the street, but we're not that far away, all things considered.
4054180	4057723	You know, we used to joke on the... Isn't it a long-running joke on this show?
4057763	4061966	The People's Republic of Davis abandoned all hope, you enter here, and look at what fucking happened!
4062227	4063167	And you all can see it.
4063648	4066770	But anyway... Anyway, outside of that joke...
4069028	4077671	Yeah, obviously, I do get the element though that Hollywood is pissed because piracy is hurting their industry, because it is.
4080049	4085854	But I think to an extent, there's two things hurting that industry.
4086495	4093541	You could say the piracy is one, but the other thing that's hurting them is their failure to adapt is killing traditional broadcast networks.
4094082	4100367	Well, their way of adapting is, well, we're just going to reduce the amount of options that you have.
4100848	4105432	And actually, the stuff that they're doing on the retail side of things is hurting them.
4105492	4106173	Like, for example...
4106933	4133986	um you know there's the 28 day windows which will soon enough be 60 day windows as soon as those contracts are up next year um 60 day windows for you know movies being in Redbox and also on Netflix and also uh Warner Brothers um started all rental customers are not able to get stuff from you know a distribution stuff until 60 days after the fact including which is great uh
4134546	4139610	One of the first titles to do this, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2.
4141151	4145775	Just two weeks after that window is up, they're pulling Harry Potter out of circulation.
4146195	4146775	All of them.
4147356	4147716	Gone.
4148156	4149077	Out of circulation.
4151079	4152640	Because you have to buy it now.
4152880	4158184	You have to because it's going out of circulation so they can re-release it later on in a special Uber edition or something.
4159125	4172059	but the fact that there's not rental options I mean not that there really is rental options because any rental store can go to the store and go buy it but it's limited because you know and when you can't find it you're like shit I'll just download it
4172270	4194040	Yeah, and it's pretty easy to download stuff, and unfortunately, you know, those customers would have rented it, hey, maybe might have liked it, and went and bought it, and still there may be people that download a really crappy copy, and they're like, hey, you know what, that movie's pretty good, I'm gonna go buy it, but it just kind of leaves a sour taste in people's mouths, especially with all the fucking tons of re-releases, or remakes, or
4195609	4197470	I think everyone needs to be voted out.
4197650	4198451	Start from scratch.
4216741	4238529	Frisbee says Hollywood is irrelevant to entertainment anymore very interesting quote very interesting and very true I think in many ways because the whole well look at what we're doing here we're doing a radio program we're doing a podcast that people can listen to in their car without having to ever turn on the radio what about web shows like the guild
4240050	4242331	or viral videos.
4243032	4253979	People at this point would rather watch cute kitty laughing and giggling videos or the dog that sounds like he's really saying I love you than watching Whitney.
4254059	4257681	There's a lot more entertainment options out there than there were say 30 years ago or whatever.
4265346	4270287	Um, you know, before when it was just like, okay, you've got radio, you've got movies, and you have TV.
4270887	4271507	That's it.
4272228	4274568	You can read a newspaper or a funny book or something like that.
4274608	4275828	But now it's just the internet.
4276329	4279169	And, I mean, the internet's just got tons of content.
4279209	4281430	Anything you're looking for, it's just right there.
4281770	4287611	So that's why these TV shows, if it's a media, you know, a very mediocre TV show, no one gives a fuck.
4287811	4288891	No one's gonna watch that.
4289411	4290032	Like, Whitney.
4290232	4290952	It was terrible.
4292652	4295093	It just happens to come on sometimes after the office is done.
4295133	4296054	I'm like, ah!
4296374	4297334	Horrible show!
4297735	4298475	Off with you!
4299515	4302617	I just want to sort of, I guess, kind of rein things back.
4302737	4305398	Everyone pay attention who you vote for.
4306278	4309060	Don't vote a party ticket because that's also just as dangerous.
4310180	4313261	Because that's how assholes get snuck into government positions.
4314682	4317603	Stop and take an effort to read who supports what.
4318323	4321784	Get a take-home ballot or an absentee ballot.
4321804	4322764	That's how I vote every year.
4322824	4323745	Do your homework.
4324365	4324885	Exactly.
4325425	4329826	And then double-check every box that you mark right before you mark it.
4330026	4332367	That's the advantage of taking one of those home.
4332867	4333948	You have time to research.
4333988	4335368	You list out the pros and cons.
4335828	4338989	But the biggest thing is actually put some damn effort into your future.
4340862	4344383	How many people just don't vote because, oh, I don't care.
4345284	4351966	Or, oh, it's too much work for me to go and mark some check boxes or read up on this stuff.
4352666	4353647	Oh, it's too much work.
4354307	4360229	Or, I'm going to buy this product because it's cheap and I don't care if they outsource all of their customer service.
4360589	4361569	That's why it's cheap.
4363370	4365211	Think about what you do before you fucking do it.
4366831	4368552	And put effort into your life.
4371660	4373264	Did Dan just laugh from the other room?
4373324	4375568	Yeah, because he's mad at me because I don't have a job yet.
4378915	4380919	You're expressing yourself in other ways.
4382401	4383942	I'd like to express myself at a job.
4384963	4386323	Someone hire me too while you're at it.
4387264	4394128	Well, you might not be getting paid for it, but you at least have the fuzzy wuzzy, I contributed to a good cause.
4394508	4395048	Addendum.
4395689	4398870	I want a job that will pay me too.
4400591	4402292	But you don't mind the charity work at all either.
4402332	4404274	I don't mind the charity work, but you don't know how many...
4410342	4411283	Because Rob's my dealer.
4446644	4458415	I am not going to live a life that I find morally objectionable.
4458495	4460918	I bet you could get like 10 votes from OLR listeners.
4464750	4466971	Alright, moving on.
4466991	4468831	Alright, in all seriousness.
4469231	4470231	Can I do my story now?
4470391	4471452	Yes, you may do your story now.
4471752	4472032	Thank you.
4472092	4473392	We need fuzzy wuzzy happy news.
4473852	4476193	How about Indie Game Music Bundle?
4476673	4480174	Yay, 10 albums for a dollar.
4481134	4492977	There's now the Indie Game Music Bundle, which is like the Humble Indie Bundle, but you get 10 items for a dollar, including stuff from Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV Minecraft.
4494057	4517408	Um, that's, uh, Minecraft Volume Alpha, uh, Cobalt EP, Super Meat Boy Digital Special Edition Soundtrack, Impostor Nostalgia, Ravenmark's Scourge of Estelion, Ares Extinction Agenda, Return All Robots, Mighty Milky Way, Mighty Flip Channel, uh, Champ, sorry, PPPPPPP, the VVVVVVVVOST, and Tree of Knowledge.
4517428	4517668	You said PP.
4518708	4529233	And if you contribute more than $10, you also get Wind Up Night, Binding of Isaac, 72 Minutes of Fame, Milk Snake, Anti-Gravity Extreme Road Trip, and Contingency.
4529573	4530413	Okay, seriously?
4530713	4539397	For just the Super Meat Boy and VVVV or PPPV, whatever soundtracks, is like worth that whole dollar like 20 times over?
4539537	4540998	You know how I'd pronounce that?
4541238	4541418	Huh.
4543561	4549024	The VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
4567904	4574108	Alright, so let's see, let's start off with some more cheerful stuff, hopefully.
4577628	4582652	So basically, there may be a sequel to Command & Conquer possibly coming from Bioware.
4582772	4593121	It was teased during a... They actually had a real brief video on teasing, I guess.
4593421	4595463	It was the Spike Video Games Awards, right around the corner.
4596144	4599186	And then, of course, there's also a screenshot that's out there.
4600187	4600267	Um...
4601508	4602168	Thanks for watching!
4616818	4617498	Victory Games.
4618038	4623440	They're working on a new strategy title, which people are thinking, hmm, maybe that's what it's called.
4623960	4624820	Command & Conquer game?
4624980	4626801	Hmm, perhaps.
4628301	4634303	Also, I guess they have another Medal of Honor thing working with one of their other studios, Danger Close.
4635284	4635984	So, lots of...
4638460	4640521	and different studios working under EA.
4640581	4647466	I remember at one point, EA was just buying up, not necessarily buying up everybody, but publishing everybody.
4647486	4657071	They have, obviously, the new Respawn Entertainment from the former execs of Infinity Ward.
4657732	4658632	They're making something.
4658692	4661354	Obviously, Valve is doing a lot of stuff with them.
4661374	4662475	Yeah.
4664588	4691467	and then Crytek as well lots of stuff there but at least the Bioware game now of course right now they don't know if Command & Conquer is really the game or not or if it's something else but the Bioware game is going to be revealed December 10th during the Spike Video Game Awards and like I said they had a very very very brief trailer of something with tanks it has tanks in it How do you feel about Command & Conquer with Dialogue Trees?
4694724	4696145	Weren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?
4696245	4697426	I soon remember this.
4697586	4698166	I used to be.
4698346	4698767	Red Alert.
4699007	4699988	Red Alert was awesome.
4700368	4702109	But I haven't played Command & Conquer in a long time.
4702889	4705231	In fact, the last one that came out, I just didn't really care for.
4708090	4708950	Well, it could be good, though.
4709350	4714111	If they turned it over to a new studio to kind of give it a creative energy reboot, that could be a good thing, right?
4714131	4714912	Yeah, and I'm not even sure.
4714932	4716452	I mean, there's a lot of studios working on stuff.
4716852	4718252	It could be Bioware that's doing it.
4718472	4720693	I think Bioware is actually going to be a different game altogether.
4721473	4728775	The thought is, though, that Victory Games is going to be doing this, but I have no idea who the hell Victory Games is.
4729575	4755295	so I guess they're a new strategy studio and you know strategy games for EA I mean really there's there was a Lord of the Rings games that they had and Command & Conquer so this Lord of the Rings is not part of you know EA anymore I'm gonna go on limb and say probably gonna be a Command & Conquer game at some point or maybe hey a new IP maybe a new IP you never know that could be too that'd be good
4756724	4762765	All right, well, let's move on to another story, and this is about a possible answer to Smash Bros.
4762845	4764386	that Sony is making.
4764446	4765826	Now, I should say this.
4766026	4767946	I always thought that Move game, what was that called?
4768066	4771187	Move Fighters or something Fighters, the one that was on Sony?
4771207	4774368	I thought that was supposed to be their answer to Smash Bros., but I guess not really.
4774868	4775028	What?
4775348	4775648	Which one?
4775688	4777949	What the hell is that game that's on Sony Move?
4778289	4779189	Is it Pocket Fighters?
4779329	4779449	No.
4780169	4782170	Thank you for watching!
4796056	4803619	There apparently is something a little more, I don't know if you want to say mainstream or what, but I guess something that's a little more directly, I don't want to say either a Smash Bros.
4803679	4806381	ripoff, but something that's supposedly in development.
4806561	4812303	There's a lot of stuff that's leaking through this blog called PaulGaleNetwork.com.
4812363	4822388	I'm not sure this gentleman's relation to the gaming industry, but a lot of the other gaming blogs have picked up and ran with this, where Title Fight is apparently the development...
4823809	4825269	Work in Progress, name of this.
4825869	4831732	And some information that's in this, it is very similar to Super Smash Bros.
4832192	4835594	It's the special moves and all those attacks you kind of do the same way.
4837355	4845498	Apparently there are some characters already noticed in this, and they kind of come in light and heavy flavors, meaning like who moves slowly, who moves lightly.
4846179	4849100	Heavier characters include Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal,
4849740	4852361	Uh, Colonel Male Reddick, Fat Princess.
4852842	4855423	Some of the lighter characters include Parappa the Rappa.
4856023	4857524	That's kind of awesome if he's in a fighting game.
4857804	4860805	Kratos, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake.
4861506	4865728	Um, not sure if there's anything about, uh, a story mode or anything like that at this time.
4866188	4866968	But, uh, yeah.
4867408	4867989	I guess, um...
4868809	4869969	We need Michael Michael is the player of
4897296	4901559	Who takes down the controller and it's all like be a part of the game or whatever.
4902179	4909124	And some people are saying maybe this is teasing this whole Sony smorgasbord of characters, this project.
4909404	4915368	Because I could certainly see this as being the big Sony reveal of next year's E3.
4915908	4923474	Because now that the Vita will already be out there, maybe there's going to be something about this game and how it works between the Vita.
4923614	4924914	It could be a Vita title for all we know.
4925195	4927116	But how it works between the Vita and the PS3 and all that.
4927616	4930858	So, could be neat, right?
4931459	4931939	It could be neat.
4932659	4934760	I love the idea of characters like Parappa the Rapper.
4934981	4937782	Like, I kind of forget about how many characters Sony really has in their pocket.
4937822	4939243	I wonder if he's going to give you a paper cut.
4939884	4940444	He might.
4940804	4943906	It could be something he does, or Umjam Malami.
4943926	4945607	If she's in it, I'm there.
4946928	4947508	But we'll see.
4948128	4948849	Milk can!
4950379	4979351	yeah my guitar is in my mind it would be interesting to see too if they were able to get from some of the other developers you know kind of like how Smash Brothers had Solid Snake and what was it in the commercial Sonic Sonic hello was in the game it would be interesting to see if Sony could get things that were very iconically Sony like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 Final Fantasy 7 was a huge Sony thing because that was when the franchise jumped over to Playstation could be interesting could be very interesting
4982383	4982663	All right.
4983084	4983364	All right.
4983744	4984344	What are we doing now?
4984424	4985865	Moving on to some release dates, right?
4985885	4990088	Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a store this week.
4990168	4993150	I imagine it's dying down significantly, but let's see.
4993210	4995152	Yeah, incredibly dying down.
4996493	4997053	A few things.
4997073	5001296	There's some cool new combo packs they have with controller and game bundles.
5002276	5027071	they did this kind of last year and so Sony's got some of those one of them is Encharted the dual pack with Encharted 1 and 2 and then you get a DualShock controller I believe that's blue and then they have one that's in black that comes with the Resistance 1 and 2 dual pack and there's also one with the God of War Origins collection that's I believe red those are all on Playstation 3 um
5030493	5031114	Let's see here.
5031174	5034036	Jaws Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.
5035638	5038381	Face Racers Photo Finish on 3DS.
5039081	5040663	Nano Assault on 3DS.
5040883	5045007	But really the only 3DS game you should really care about is Mario Kart 7.
5045727	5047269	And that's coming out one week from today.
5047449	5047829	That's it.
5048650	5049791	Oh my god, one week from today?
5049811	5050612	That's awesome.
5050632	5051253	One week from today.
5051593	5052154	I can't believe it.
5053086	5054166	XBOX 360 REVELATIONS
5075674	5083920	Sonic Generations, Shiro no Jiku is the subtitle for it over there, comes out this week, as well as King of Fighters 13 makes its way out in Japan this week.
5084340	5090705	Also, one other game on the 360 this week, a game called Ever 17 comes out in regular and limited edition flavors.
5091405	5092946	I'm not sure what this game is all about.
5093006	5104274	It's an adventure game, but I'm noticing it's, you know, anime chicks in schoolgirl outfits, and in this one clip, I kid you not, I'm looking, she's holding a hamster and talking to the hamster, so...
5105282	5105762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5129919	5131000	And then the third one's out.
5131081	5135285	And so I start reading the entire Wiki, Evangelion Wiki.
5136326	5137487	Just like, oh, that's it.
5137667	5138108	Okay, cool.
5139060	5141040	Going to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
5141160	5146541	Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus comes out this week as well as the Sonic Generations and King of Fighters 13 releases.
5147061	5149822	Also on the Sony system this week, Tekken Hybrid.
5150122	5151362	You know, I saw this at Target.
5151702	5153883	We have a version here in America that I think just came out this week.
5154423	5160324	And I had, like, Alan picked it up off the shelf and was like, I didn't know that this was coming out.
5160364	5162084	And I was like, shit, I didn't know about this one either.
5162524	5165985	But yeah, this is, what the hell, it's like tag tournament and...
5166716	5168079	It's Tag Tournament HD.
5168559	5179078	There's a Tag Tournament 2 preview and then also Tech and Bullying, but I think that's also part of Tag Tournament.
5179259	5179699	And it's all in 3D.
5180900	5184102	Well, no, it's just those games.
5184222	5191747	Plus, it's also Tekken, the Tekken 3D animated movie that just came out as a 3D Blu-ray.
5191888	5195850	So a hybrid as far as it's both a movie and both a game.
5195910	5201794	So you can even take that game and play it in a regular Blu-ray player and you can watch the movie in 3D if you want.
5202435	5210160	Or you can just... What's great, though, is remember the new Tekken game that's coming out on the 3DS will also have that movie in 3D on it.
5211081	5211842	That was pretty cool.
5212403	5213925	Gotta hit up my Namco guy.
5215387	5220255	Alright, just a reminder that PS Vita is three weeks away, December 17th.
5221276	5222058	In Japan.
5222098	5225162	In Japan, not here, but I am doing Japanese releases right now.
5226303	5246915	Sony PSP this week since that's still the Sony system only big releases Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 4Z comes out this week that's from Namkai Bando and it's an action related title that looks like kind of a 3D-ish 3D-esque robot fighting game kind of like Ultraman style characters all fighting
5247455	5248896	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5272935	5285720	Crayon Shin-chan, Uchu de Achu, Yuujou no Oba Karate Crayon Shin-chan is old school manga and anime What was the last part of that?
5285780	5298966	I love this No Oba Karate, it makes it sound like it's a karate crayon game And it is an action based game and it's based on that old anime Kind of like a platformer, looks a little bit like your Rayman kind of platformer game
5299766	5305250	So that's it for releases in Japan.
5305490	5307811	For the UK, really not a whole bunch.
5309332	5315316	We have on the 30th, Darkstalkers for PlayStation 3, which is kind of cool.
5315916	5318598	And then on December 1st, there's Infinity Blade 2.
5319458	5328544	December 2nd, Ace Combat, Assault Horizon Legacy, Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC, Mario Kart 7, and Super Pokemon Rumble.
5329284	5329664	That's it.
5331064	5334245	Just a few more stories for you guys and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
5334385	5335325	But first, DarkSakura.
5336025	5340847	Well, there have been a lot of pre-orders for the Vita in Hong Kong.
5342167	5349148	Basically, they are the second city that are getting the system.
5350088	5356650	And, well, there's mobbing in online stores that can't meet the traffic and...
5358817	5359918	Lots of stuff going on.
5360958	5365141	But it's, I guess, not nearly as bad as getting pepper sprayed in the face over $2 waffle iron.
5367242	5371705	But hey, what this basically means is that the early demand is there.
5371825	5373666	This could be kind of a big deal.
5374226	5374586	Yarp.
5375867	5376748	It could very well be.
5377628	5379269	And I guess that's really all we can say about it for now.
5379589	5380450	I know.
5381631	5385073	I haven't had any real reaction out of it, just that it's sold.
5385113	5387454	Maybe people are just too busy hiding under their desk playing it.
5387965	5391768	It's interesting to know if the system's going to do well or if it's going to fall flat, so we'll see.
5393709	5394569	Well, hopefully.
5395990	5396250	Alright.
5397031	5397972	I have high hopes for it.
5398832	5400213	Seems to be doing pretty well.
5400615	5402216	Yeah, I'm definitely going to get one.
5403177	5403437	Loki.
5404758	5408680	So there's been a lot of talk of piracy this week.
5409120	5416044	And one person, of course, to speak out about it is Gabe Newell, the head of Valve.
5416705	5424469	And basically, one of the things he says is piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem.
5425770	5432274	We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy.
5432354	5435535	Piracy is always a service problem, not a pricing problem.
5435555	5446281	For example, if a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24-7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says that the product is region-locked,
5446681	5449082	will come to your country three months after a U.S.
5449162	5454024	release and can only be purchased at a brick-and-mortar store, then the pirate service is more valuable.
5454144	5461687	Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product by either directly restricting a customer's use or by creating uncertainty.
5462247	5473952	So basically kind of alluding to Assassin's Creed 2 and the Ubisoft DRM, which we mentioned earlier, pretty much got destroyed in a few months
5474632	5475233	A few days.
5475593	5480676	And then, of course, you know, they're saying, you know, Steam isn't without its own problems.
5480956	5491003	Saints Row the Third, you know, used, I guess, Steamworks and stuff and is unavailable on the UK Steam store for reasons that THQ are yet to elaborate on.
5491603	5493444	So that kind of sucks that they don't have it yet.
5493464	5494405	Yeah.
5496112	5501056	but I mean Steam's not perfect either because their stuff gets pirated just as well.
5501937	5504539	A lot of people seem to kind of be on board with Steam.
5505120	5505480	Yeah.
5505540	5506081	Sales help.
5506421	5522655	I was going to elaborate real quick because it's not one of the stories that we had earlier but some other people were talking piracy and funny enough it's also Ubisoft and their latest game to be coming out well
5523195	5526659	Ever delayed game to be coming out, I Am Alive.
5530063	5535830	They were saying that, well, we're not going to put it on PC because... Piracy issues.
5535910	5536450	Basically...
5538152	5549335	The creative director, Stanislas Metra, has basically said that PC piracy makes the financial viability of a game on the platform uncertain.
5549755	5554796	And Ubisoft's previously announced title, I guess, is only planned for consoles.
5554816	5556136	And of course, that would be I Am Alive.
5556496	5564698	It says, we heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them.
5565006	5568308	Interesting that they used bitching in their official statement.
5568688	5580135	It says, but are these people just making noise because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play?
5580695	5582116	Would they buy it if we made it?
5582556	5592302	And he continues saying that if 50,000 PC players buy the game, it's not worth the cost of putting a team of 12 on the project for three months.
5594563	5605867	It's hard because there's so much piracy and so few people are playing PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it.
5606387	5608228	Of course, that pissed off everybody.
5608928	5609688	All sorts of people.
5611429	5619852	What's great, though, is shortly afterwards, after everyone completely complained about that, he backpedaled on that.
5619932	5620893	He's saying...
5623871	5625272	You know, let's see here.
5625412	5633876	Honestly, which game maker would not love to see his game to be playable on as many platforms and as by many people as possible?
5637413	5638554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5658335	5669021	I bet, and even though the company's not very vocal about this, and for good reason, obviously you see all this backlash, I honestly truly believe a big part of the delay for PC was so that consoles got the jump.
5669841	5677365	Because it's all about playing it, and this goes back to Gabe Newell's point about convenience and getting it as soon as possible and the releases and all that.
5677725	5678946	People want to play it now.
5679646	5683289	And I think because it's on the consoles early, I think it really helps.
5683369	5688473	I mean, nothing's ever going to stop piracy, but I think it helps turn a lot of people away from it.
5689955	5692617	I mean, certainly piracy happens on the consoles too, but it's a lot harder.
5692837	5697381	And Ubisoft further digs into themselves deeper by...
5698101	5702143	Skipping Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC as well because piracy.
5702884	5706606	They even said they're going to do Ghost Recon Online.
5707466	5719452	When we started Ghost Recon Online, we were thinking about Ghost Recon Future Soldier having something ported in the classic way without any deep development because we know that 95% of our consumers will pirate the game.
5719592	5721914	So we said, okay, we'll have to change our mind.
5722654	5727966	well that's very positive that your game you feel it's just going to be pirated like crazy
5733611	5737513	We're giving away most of the content for free because there's no barrier to entry.
5737653	5740514	This is talking about Ghost Recon Online.
5741754	5749857	To the users that are traditionally playing the game by getting it through Pirate Bay, we said, okay, go ahead, guys.
5749917	5752038	This is what you're asking for.
5752098	5752898	We've listened to you.
5753258	5754639	We're going to give you this experience.
5754699	5755659	It's easy to download.
5755679	5757780	There's no DRM that will pollute your experience.
5758300	5761762	So basically, they're like, well, there's nothing we can do, so we're just going to stop.
5761782	5763223	So we've designed a free-to-play game.
5763543	5763723	Yeah.
5764703	5765564	Interesting tactic.
5765844	5772427	You know, as much as I think people want to hate this guy, I think it's somewhat of a fair response.
5773628	5774148	I really do.
5775330	5778731	I mean, that is, but I am sorry.
5779191	5780111	I am alive, though.
5781572	5782692	First off, it's running in older.
5782752	5785133	It's not like they have to create the engine totally from scratch.
5785173	5786713	It's the Splinter Cell Conviction engine.
5787814	5794456	And it's also a game that's been delayed and delayed and delayed, and I don't think it's a game that really a lot of people are like, oh my god, I gotta play this.
5795656	5799097	I think they're just pissed off that they're saying, oh, well, no one plays PC games.
5800178	5801478	I think there's a lot of people who disagree with you.
5803038	5803318	All right.
5803478	5809404	I'm going to our chat room for some comments on some various stories we've been talking about because obviously we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5809924	5810725	Except everyone.
5811165	5820453	Usually our chat room is at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but due to website issues tonight, we are giving you the long way of getting there, which is going on to IRC, the Game Surge Network, and we are at Channel Orange Lounge.
5820774	5821314	Or you know what?
5821354	5826639	For real, if you really don't know how to get there, just go to chat.allgames.com and ask them, how do I join Orange Lounge?
5826659	5827119	They'll tell you.
5827319	5827720	They're nice.
5828220	5829301	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5852530	5855671	Interesting perspective because you might say, oh no, that can't be it.
5855711	5857451	But that kind of shit happens in America too.
5858012	5860832	Like when the Wii's first came out and hell, the Xboxes.
5861172	5866014	Remember when people were buying up the limited Xbox supplies and then reselling them for twice as much?
5866494	5868694	This shit happens with new tech all the time.
5868794	5870955	So I could believe that.
5871295	5873036	I can actually really believe that.
5873156	5873736	So we'll see.
5873796	5877817	I guess that isn't necessarily an indicator of how strong something's going to sell because...
5878277	5896823	people tried to do that with the 3DS and it didn't work so well for them I don't think they made money on that so there you go Kaijudo in chat says there is only one way to stop piracy make everything free yes Kaijudo I need you to make me a sandwich and don't you expect me to pay you for it just teasing
5898584	5900366	But he does go on to say it will never happen.
5900767	5903530	Piracy will never... It will never happen.
5903610	5906874	No one will... Nowhere will piracy ever stop.
5907114	5910318	So please stop torturing us with your shitty attempts at DRM.
5913436	5913736	All right.
5914758	5915398	Let's move on.
5932955	5940941	from a website, damlag.com, and it's an article about game developers, you need to take your demos more seriously.
5941562	5947527	And of course, now that I'm trying to bring it up in studio, it's not loading, the joys of live radio and internet timeouts.
5948768	5950769	I did read the article a little bit before the show.
5952551	5955693	I think an ad is trying to prevent this thing from popping up all the way or something.
5956814	5957655	The internet's working.
5958055	5958415	Yeah, I know.
5958455	5959616	No, the internet's working fine.
5960757	5961418	Amazing!
5963445	5964033	Damn people
5967330	5973355	So apparently this demo is talking about the Rayman Origins demo had recently... Oh, it's working for you?
5973495	5974076	Fantastic.
5974136	5975377	It's not coming up on the computer over there.
5975757	5975997	All right.
5976518	5980421	So it's talking about how the Rayman Origins demo was really good.
5980641	5989248	And the author of the article at Damlag.com was talking about how he's played through the demo several times and how it's just a great game.
5989289	5991450	It kind of has elements of New Super Mario Bros.
5991510	5994413	Wii and mixing with the original Rayman and so forth.
5995534	5997836	I didn't really know about this game before.
5997916	6002439	Sure, I heard a little bit about it at E3, but I'm kind of throwing this in there.
6002640	6004821	Let's face it, it's a really crowded time of year.
6005162	6006743	There's a lot of video games out right now.
6006763	6008284	It's really kind of hard to get the attention.
6009225	6015770	The article talks about how developers usually think a demo is an afterthought if they even bother to put one out at all.
6016651	6034967	Um, and then talks about, you know, the article goes on to talk about how, um, you know, if, if you can get a customer to really experience the game, or even a demo that's mid-game, citing like Heavenly Sword, something that kind of takes not just the beginning of the game, but something that's a little bit in the middle of the game, um, that's a really good demo.
6035288	6036028	And then some...
6037069	6037309	and so on.
6050791	6053213	So whatever happened to a good old-fashioned demo?
6053233	6055034	Because a lot of games don't even bother with them.
6055074	6059917	Peggle Extreme, I mean, if you want to look at that, that came out with all of the Valve branding on it.
6060758	6069183	But it was, in essence, a free demo because it says, hey, if you really liked playing this, and you get, you know, I think like 10 levels or so of Peggle.
6069804	6072946	It says, hey, if you like this, you know, try out the real thing.
6073006	6073446	Here you go.
6075247	6077208	So PopCap did it.
6077509	6077729	Mm-hmm.
6078530	6086794	Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story a little bit is I kind of wanted to ask you guys, how important is a demo for you guys in influencing your game buying decisions?
6087214	6089115	I mean, do you like to use reviews?
6089215	6091115	Do you just kind of jump in if it's cheap?
6091536	6093276	Do you use game demos or what?
6093877	6097338	I'll kind of answer this is that I do like game demos.
6098058	6101500	I don't think they're necessarily the most important thing in selling a game.
6102045	6130518	because I think especially now that we live in a day and age where we have like Gamefly and hell even now streaming games thanks to like OnLive and so forth OnLive especially is interesting because now your demo can just be oh play an hour of it for free or something like what Steam did over the weekend with Magica so I think there's a lot of that evolving but I'm not going to lie a really good demo can absolutely sell a game absolutely because it leaves you wanting more you know
6131218	6136039	Well, on top of that, you also get an idea of edits that they've made in games, too.
6136599	6140220	Because a lot of times a demo's not going to have all the edits that make it into the final game.
6141240	6147242	And if you are clever and can get into the information on the disc, you can get more out of it.
6148442	6152283	But, I mean, we've got a pile of PlayStation Magazine demos in the vault.
6152683	6154465	Oh yeah, those PlayStation demos are always the bomb.
6154485	6155065	Those are great.
6155466	6156967	I've played so much Jumping Flash.
6158408	6162432	From the demo disc that came with my friend's ex-boyfriend's PlayStation.
6162692	6168537	Well, how many people bought, what was it, like Brave Fencer Mushashi or whatever just because it came with a Final Fantasy VIII demo?
6168577	6169719	Yes.
6171220	6172941	What game got the Final Fantasy VII demo?
6173822	6174363	Can't remember.
6174383	6176445	Tobal.
6176465	6176565	Tobal.
6178906	6180407	and that sold a lot just because of the demo too.
6180427	6181628	But Toeball actually wasn't a bad game.
6181988	6182609	Yeah, I know.
6183049	6184570	I really wish they'd make a new Toeball.
6184950	6185790	They did a second one.
6185850	6190433	Well, I know they did a second one and it was awesome but I really wish they'd make a new Toeball.
6191373	6196336	Going to the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says, I usually ask people.
6197036	6200218	Jvmon says, I use demos for franchises I'm not familiar with.
6200358	6204441	If it wasn't for demos, I would never have bought Blue Dragon or Cold Step Saga.
6205381	6206722	Cold Step Saga is awesome.
6207102	6214884	Coldstep Saga is an interesting one because I didn't play the demo for that but a friend of mine got me into that and was like this is the best game ever and nobody's ever heard of it and it's true.
6215124	6219345	I've never heard anything about that game but it's like freaking Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
6219365	6220265	It was actually kind of awesome.
6221185	6223806	Kaijudo says demo made me buy Just Cause 2.
6223926	6224706	I love that game.
6225246	6229167	Hitstun goes so far as to make a little graph here.
6229667	6231928	My usual considerations when buying games.
6232588	6235989	Friends playing greater than reviews, greater than
6236189	6239694	Price greater than hype greater than demo.
6240015	6242098	So kind of putting demo towards the end of the chain there.
6242972	6249437	See, I honestly, because my friends have kind of different tastes all across the board.
6249957	6253360	So one person may like something, and I've turned out to completely hate it.
6254100	6255982	I mean, because it's just how it is.
6256182	6262046	I don't believe in making a judgment until I've played some of it, you know, or seen it played.
6262947	6268091	So demos and, you know, online videos of a game really...
6269995	6274057	Do more for me than relying on another person's opinion, if that makes sense.
6274377	6282241	Not that I disrespect my friends' opinions, but it's just, honestly, there's games that a lot of people love that I'm like, what the hell?
6283181	6286683	Like, I'll be perfectly honest, I'm kind of not all that into Skyrim.
6288533	6289474	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
6313163	6317329	Alright, but then Technus kind of gives us our final thought on this story here.
6317570	6320654	I think not enough companies make demos for their games.
6321375	6323819	It is a lot of work though to turn out a demo, I mean...
6325290	6352124	but yeah, I think people discover games in many different ways, and a good demo is certainly one of them, but a bad demo can really damn your game, you know, one other thing I guess I want to open this, because I'm not so sure the article got into talking about this, but I think when it comes to the Xbox Live Arcade games or PlayStation Network games, those demos can really make or break the damn game I really do make my decisions based off those demos I play those demos a lot, I really do um
6353725	6356187	And I think those demos are really important.
6356607	6360790	Because especially when it's so easy, just press X to upgrade.
6361270	6361870	You know what I mean?
6362370	6364132	How easy is that if you really enjoy a demo?
6365352	6370035	Anyhow, we're going to now take a moment to dive into gaming history.
6371736	6373637	with the classic Game of the Week segment.
6373697	6374997	No demo needed here.
6375357	6377237	You play it because DarkSakura said so.
6377657	6380038	It's the classic Game of the Week.
6380118	6381358	Very interesting choice this week.
6381378	6383679	I hope that you picked the music from the first one on the list.
6384739	6387620	There was no list this week, DarkSakura, because of the website.
6387660	6388760	But I told you what the game was.
6389080	6392121	You did, so hopefully this is the right one.
6392141	6392441	We'll see.
6393061	6393621	Just play.
6395562	6398442	Okay, so the game of the week is called Three Wonders.
6399042	6400823	Or as it was in Japan, Wonder 3.
6401803	6404303	And it's an arcade game that was made by Capcom in 1991.
6404383	6405844	It's a PS1 game.
6406344	6407844	And you can choose three games in it.
6408324	6412045	You have Midnight Wanderer's Quest for the Chariot, which in Japan is called Roosters.
6413045	6417846	And it has a hobbit named Lou and Shiva in it.
6417926	6422267	Which I want to still say Shiva because that's how it would have been pronounced in the Japanese version.
6423287	6428530	Then there's Chariot Adventure Through the Sky, which is also just called Chariot in Japan, and then Don't Pull.
6429330	6433812	Midnight Wanderers is a platform game, and it's actually really, really cool.
6433832	6436953	I've watched Dan play it a number of times, and I've played it a little bit myself.
6437033	6437474	Pretty fun.
6437994	6446258	And then Chariot is a shmup where you have Lou and Shiva as well, and then Don't Pull is kind of like Pango.
6446858	6450940	It's a pulling puzzle-type game.
6451785	6455188	It came out in 1998 on the Sega Saturn and on the PlayStation.
6455628	6459591	And then Capcom re-released it in 2006 on the Capcom Classics Collection Vol.
6459931	6465855	2 on PS2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection Remix for the PSP.
6466536	6469938	Really, there's not a whole bunch to say because they're...
6470919	6471259	Hey, hey, Dan!
6471279	6473901	Get in here and tell us about the game!
6501615	6502276	He said no.
6502416	6504618	He's a butthead.
6505558	6509961	But it really is very bright, vivid colors.
6510001	6510742	Very pretty.
6510822	6511983	It's a great game.
6513024	6517086	Lou also made it as an assist character for Marvel vs. Capcom.
6518467	6524852	And he basically looks exactly like he did in Midnight Wanderers.
6525452	6526313	And then he...
6531642	6537209	Uh, Shiva was actually, um, well, there was a character based on him for, uh, Cannon Spike.
6537710	6540413	It was called Shiba Shintaro, who was based off of him.
6541094	6542415	But, I mean, that's really it.
6542515	6544618	I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.
6544638	6545759	Everyone should play this game.
6546640	6549404	But, really, everyone should just be playing the Midnight Wanderers part of the game.
6551443	6554265	So the classic game of the week is Three Wonders.
6554646	6556287	Or if you want, it's just Midnight Wonders, really.
6557628	6558329	Well, yeah.
6558389	6559570	But I mean, Shuri's not bad.
6559590	6560531	Shuri's not bad.
6560671	6562813	And I don't know, the puzzle game kind of pisses me off.
6563633	6565395	But then again, I suck at Pango.
6567176	6569398	I like Pango, so I would actually check out the puzzler.
6569598	6570900	That sounds like kind of cool.
6570920	6571160	Yeah.
6571240	6574583	And if anyone finds a Three Wonders machine, freaking take a picture of it for me.
6575686	6577728	Yeah, I've never even heard of this game.
6577748	6578409	I really haven't.
6579350	6580911	And it even runs on, like, Capcom hardware.
6580931	6582272	You'd think this thing would be everywhere, so.
6582292	6585115	Well, you can, I mean, you can run it on main, but easy.
6585155	6586536	Yeah, emulator, easy, but.
6586777	6587217	Yeah.
6588478	6590240	But it's really neat, but yeah.
6590921	6594003	I think just the star of the collection is Midnight Wonders.
6594524	6595064	All right, there you go.
6595084	6598848	Your classic game of the week, Three Wonders in the arcade.
6598888	6599729	Never on a console, right?
6600473	6624237	I just said it came out on consoles Sorry, I was trying to deal with another issue It came out in 1998 on the Saturn and Playstation Oh nice, okay And then we got re-releases in 2006 for the Playstation 2 and Xbox which was the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 Ah, that's right PSP is Capcom Classics Collection Remixed Alright Very, very awesome thing to have
6625422	6645889	Alright, well we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys, we'll be right back with part B of our show, which might be a little bit shorter, but that just means more time for calls, and coming up tonight, a list list, and we'll tell you guys the topic when we come back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6652375	6661141	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio for the second half of our show, live on November the 27th of 2011 at All Games Radio.
6661181	6663082	Yes, our website's busted right now.
6663623	6671948	If you try to visit it at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you get a message that implies we haven't paid a bill, but trust me, if it was that easy to fix, we would have done it for the show.
6671988	6682215	Keep in mind our website is graciously donated, but you can't complain about free, so we just kind of have to wait for things to work themselves out behind the scenes.
6682675	6687979	So, anyhow, moving on, we are still trying to tape a show so that whenever our website does get back up, we can podcast it.
6688300	6690822	And we're having fun with our live listeners who are in our chat room.
6691142	6695846	You still can't get to our chat room even without chat.orangelingeradio.com, which you can do.
6696246	6697387	You can go to...
6699068	6716071	any IRC client look up Game Surge which is at irc.gamesurge.net and join Channel Orange Lounge you can also do that through the All Games chat client so if you just go over to chat.allgames.com if you really want something online just join Channel Orange Lounge from there it's really easy
6716511	6717612	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6737589	6759095	so get your tweets in if you haven't already sent those in twitter.com slash OLR no rapid fire news tonight we're just going to get right into some longer news we'll start with oh I wanted to actually I did want to talk about this quickly we talked about like Black Friday stuff a little bit already and just kind of like some of the craziness that was going on out there
6760056	6774635	One of the stories that I had actually kind of grabbed Was about folks that were actually pepper sprayed in the face And slammed and all this stuff I think a lot of you guys heard about this I'm sure it was all over the news Some chick that was trying to get an Xbox Actually pepper sprayed people trying to get to it
6775075	6777778	So, you know, people are just getting crazy out there.
6779159	6783182	I have zero desire to participate in any of this type of Black Friday antics, but I noticed it.
6783583	6792310	I was leaving a Thanksgiving dinner in the Bay Area at about 1130, and I had to drive my friend that lives there, lives right by that Fry's in Fremont.
6793431	6795052	or maybe it's actually Milpitas at that point.
6795072	6795632	Yeah, Milpitas.
6795992	6814740	Yeah, so I had to literally drive right by that and yeah, parking lot was a madhouse and there was already a line at 1130, you know, and it just, I was like, I do not want to be anywhere near here and it's funny because you have Fry's on the left side of the road and then Walmart on the right side of the road and so like all the cars in the left turn lane were backed up and all the cars in the right turn lane were backed up.
6815000	6816321	The only clear lane was the middle.
6816681	6826823	you could zoom right down through the middle and get back on the freeway which is right there I for one would never be out in this kind of madness I didn't leave the house I don't blame you
6827332	6827852	Thanks for watching!
6847348	6852271	So, yeah, I am much more of a fan of Cyber Monday, which is coming up tomorrow.
6852291	6854012	And I guess some of the sales are out there already.
6854492	6856913	Wait till they figure out how to pepper spray you through the computer.
6860115	6861235	There's always that Tumblr.
6861295	6862716	You can see that pepper spray guy.
6862876	6865258	All it was pepper spray cop, pepper spraying cop, that Tumblr.
6866879	6867920	Also, I want to mention this.
6868000	6874927	Another great way to save money is through the sales online through services like Steam, who just had a pretty awesome sale, I got to say.
6875287	6877810	Portal 2 was $10 on Wednesday.
6878571	6881013	Civilization 5 was $10 yesterday.
6881774	6882995	They've been having some really good sales.
6883015	6884317	I don't know if you guys have picked anything up.
6884657	6885198	I actually didn't...
6885678	6890464	I got to admit, a lot of the games that were on sale that I would have bought, I already bought at full price earlier.
6890904	6893668	So I didn't really indulge in the sale, except I did buy some DLC.
6893868	6897392	I bought some Civ V DLC that I hadn't picked up before during the sale.
6897973	6902238	Did you guys purchase anything through these sales?
6902848	6903108	Nope.
6903509	6903749	No?
6904589	6904790	No?
6905330	6906371	No?
6906391	6908652	What about you guys in our chatroom at chat.northwestradio.com?
6908673	6914217	You know, I tried to poll the people on our Google+, our new Google Plus page, and I kind of got a very similar response.
6914297	6916719	It's like, nah, didn't want to be out fighting in it.
6917019	6919080	I had a better time just kind of pointing and laughing at people.
6919301	6923143	I've learned my lesson from going to some Black Friday stuff.
6923243	6927267	Not necessarily lining up at midnight or something, but just going there during the day.
6928207	6947016	and I remember the last time I actually went out well there was two times there was one where I went out because I actually needed some DVD-Rs and so I went to Best Buy it wasn't actually that bad it was just like normal Saturday traffic I think as long as you're not there like an hour or two before or after opening it's fine
6947426	6948767	Yeah, so that was that.
6949347	6953568	And then I went to Fry's one time because I was looking for something.
6953948	6956849	I don't remember exactly what now, but Fry's was terrible.
6957069	6966913	And it was like in the afternoon on Black Friday and the line was just like an hour and a half long for whatever.
6967353	6987354	and I mean that's bad when they have like 30 registers open or something but and that line is still that long it was really bad and they had a guy walking around the balloon that a giant like weather balloon says line ends here and he's basically this line just snakes through the entire store
6988035	6989096	It's ridiculous.
6989356	6989716	Crazy.
6989936	6992157	But yeah, I don't really like doing that stuff.
6992217	7004902	And even the recent games I've got, I actually have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 that I got for free and Skyrim I got for free because every now and then the publisher likes to actually send us stuff.
7005322	7010744	So I played that, but I'm not going to buy any new stuff.
7010764	7011505	In fact, actually...
7012685	7015226	Probably not going to buy any new games for a long time.
7015566	7018487	I don't really know what the next new game I'd probably get.
7018688	7020548	Borderlands 2, but that's about it.
7020628	7021629	I've got to buy Mario Kart.
7022389	7023749	I still have a credit on Amazon, though.
7023950	7026451	I'm seriously thinking of trading in Modern Warfare 3 for...
7029813	7047567	I'd probably lean more towards Super Mario Land 3D than I would Mario Kart because Mario Kart's kind of it's the same stuff all over again they're like repeating old classic tracks instead of coming up with original stuff and then adding the classic tracks
7049938	7051579	We got a couple comments in our chat rooms.
7051839	7058962	Evil, or E3VL, which I think he is evil, is in our chat saying, is the Cyber Monday sale separate from the Autumn sale on Steam?
7059303	7062664	You know, I'm not sure if Steam's going to do something separate on Monday.
7062784	7063705	I wouldn't anticipate it.
7064085	7068247	Well, there's also, remember, the Amazon Gold Box sales, which are always really good.
7068948	7072049	Cyber Monday is actually an internet-wide thing.
7072110	7076932	It's kind of the internet's response to Black Friday because Monday is when everybody goes back to work.
7077372	7080654	And I guess there's this perception that nobody actually works when they go back to work.
7080694	7082255	Instead, they're online shopping all day.
7082996	7084316	It's pretty accurate sometimes.
7084536	7087078	All these companies do these big online sales on Monday.
7087158	7087258	Yeah.
7087598	7091681	It's totally a man-made, invented thing, but hey, any excuse for a sale, right?
7092261	7094023	So Steam may get in on it.
7094623	7096664	I know Microsoft is supposed to be doing something.
7097825	7100687	They've been doing some sales on Xbox Live all week.
7100927	7102008	You can get things like Bejeweled 3.
7103669	7104730	God, some game was only like 240.
7104810	7107332	Oh, I think it's Bejeweled Blitz or something.
7107552	7110294	It's only like 240 Microsoft points, which is about what it's worth.
7112494	7132399	JVMod in our chatroom is talking about some of the Black Friday sales he got I got the $200 Playstation 3 bundle the $179.99 3DS bundle the $199.99 42 inch TV and a 3004 laptop I don't know what a 3004 laptop is I think he mistyped something the rest of that sounds like you dude can I have a loan?
7133539	7135041	Probably $300 for a laptop.
7135081	7135341	Oh, yeah.
7135421	7136763	Maybe that's what it is.
7136783	7137244	$300 for a laptop.
7137284	7137604	Oh, $300.
7137664	7138826	Maybe shift F4.
7139527	7141589	So that's nice, though.
7142250	7145394	That's like your whole electronics for several years taken care of in one day.
7145474	7145975	It's pretty nice.
7147036	7151942	And Technus says, Oh, and after working a Black Friday myself, I cannot support it.
7152783	7157284	You know, I gotta say, props to you folks in retail, especially those of you on the front lines.
7157305	7164167	I mean, yeah, people pepper spraying in Walmart and shit is madness, but can you imagine having to work that Walmart that night?
7164427	7165107	Oh my God.
7168208	7168948	You poor people.
7169728	7172609	There's a very big reason why I never want to do retail again.
7174070	7175690	It's all summed up in one day right there.
7176350	7177931	All right, let's move on with some gaming news, Loki.
7180376	7182438	Well, just because you've done, what, ten of them in a row?
7183698	7184739	Dan called us all blisses.
7186700	7187561	Uh, yeah.
7187821	7194065	I got a funny story, actually, about this story that I'm going to talk about.
7194085	7194946	First off, let's talk about this.
7195706	7196627	Ridge Racer Vita.
7197468	7199449	We were talking about why people pirate stuff.
7200089	7201010	This is pretty bad.
7201671	7205833	Ridge Racer Vita, it only includes three courses and five cars.
7206994	7208235	It sounds almost like a demo to me.
7209816	7219403	Apparently, according to the Japanese press sampling of Ridge Racer, they're surprised to find that the game only has a few tracks and a few cars.
7219703	7226848	They said, of course, there will be download content, but it's just weird that there's so little material.
7227348	7235394	Also, apparently, I guess there's also supposed to be this Planetary League as well, which is a new mode that sounds kind of neat.
7236054	7237175	and Planetary League.
7237656	7241619	I guess Namco is going to be sending out team battle missions for multiplayer.
7242140	7249606	Plus it's also playable over Wi-Fi and ad hoc and all sorts of stuff and you can share ghost data.
7249706	7254230	But three tracks and five cars?
7254830	7255251	Really?
7255631	7259194	And on top of that... Because you know it's going to be DLC.
7259495	7263378	And on top of that, the game is supposed to be slightly cheaper than...
7264781	7265681	you know, most of the video games.
7266001	7266981	40 bucks instead of 50.
7267642	7268202	Exactly.
7268682	7269182	Exactly.
7269202	7270262	Boo hiss.
7270362	7274803	If this is true, if this is true, then fuck this game for real.
7275003	7278804	And it only runs at 30 frames per second instead of 60 frames per second.
7279264	7282365	And here's, I had a dream last night about this.
7282665	7288706	I seriously, for some reason, and I don't even know why because I read this earlier in the week, some reason I just had a dream about this.
7289386	7293187	And I remember I was talking to some guy
7293587	7309478	who apparently in the dream was representative of the person responsible for this game and my response was this what the fuck were you thinking I mean really seriously three fucking tracks and five cars no one's gonna fucking buy this game
7309838	7310439	It's Ridge Racer
7324815	7325775	That's all you get for this.
7325795	7327596	I mean, three fucking tracks.
7327676	7328317	Here's the thing.
7328377	7331138	It's one thing to just openly reject this game if it does come out $40.
7331418	7338321	I hope this is just like maybe an early build, like a press build or something, like a demo.
7338401	7345985	Maybe just they're really working to get the full game done and it's just not ready, you know, and it's not going to be ready until it goes gold.
7346445	7348266	I'm really hoping that's what happens.
7349026	7353048	And soon we'll get this Japanese website that's like, comes with 20 tracks and 20...
7353588	7356309	Oh, I hope so, because Ridge Racer is pretty awesome.
7357049	7361731	I think for the launch, the 3DS, it was one of the best games that they had available.
7361771	7362431	It was, yeah.
7362491	7364752	Even though there was all rehash stuff.
7364812	7368093	But the 3D effects, it was a good 3D show-off game, yeah.
7368633	7369994	But, I mean, seriously.
7370014	7372294	I like Dungeon Buster in our chat room.
7372775	7374095	Ridge Ripoff!
7375956	7376656	It is just...
7377791	7404362	and it's funny though because I actually I watched I was reading you know this and then I watched like the trailer I'm like hey you know what that trailer only shows these three tracks I wonder but it's gonna be one thing if the game comes out like this but it's gonna be just flat-out insulting if they add like a bunch of tracks as download content unless it's all free it's free DLC they won't but why would they do that they won't no
7407023	7408724	Now, here's where I would support it.
7409344	7412265	Remember on the PSP, they had Rock Band.
7412505	7413485	You could buy Rock Band in the game.
7413825	7419346	Then they also had Rock Band where you could download the free demo and then you pay for songs.
7419666	7420347	Oh, yeah, I remember that.
7420387	7420667	Yeah, yeah.
7421207	7421727	I'm fine with that.
7421747	7428489	If they want to do this, like, say, put it on the store and, like, you know, okay, well, you can buy the game for nothing.
7428649	7432750	It comes with three tracks and five cars, and you can buy the rest of the game for DLC.
7432770	7432890	Okay.
7433670	7451244	I'm fine with that or you know you pay 99 cents and you get the rest of this later on but as a retail game for like I'm assuming this is going to be 40 bucks I have yet to see the setup information for this I can't confirm on the price yet hopefully I'll know that soon but this is good it's probably gonna be about $40 game
7452270	7457814	Well Namco, one thing you need to do when you get back to work this week after the holiday is you need to clarify.
7457974	7465961	Well I guess maybe in Japan they didn't really have the same holiday but still come next week at work they need to clarify what the hell is going on here?
7466021	7467522	What is this game actually going to have in it?
7468443	7470324	So hopefully next week we can correct that.
7471932	7472813	Anyhow, let's move on.
7475015	7483422	A story has hit ComputerAndVideoGames.com about two possible, as they're calling it, Xbox 720 models that are planned.
7483462	7489507	Apparently, there's going to be a dual SKU strategy expected, along with a significant Kinect upgrade.
7489567	7493290	Long story short, you may or may not remember this.
7493310	7496393	Remember the Xbox 360 had two ways you could buy it.
7496853	7500156	They had the, what, the regular, or what was it called, the
7500336	7501958	Core and the Premium
7522757	7528239	and it came with, thank you, a wireless controller instead of a wired one.
7528859	7529900	That was the other big difference.
7529940	7533681	And I think a shiny silver door as opposed to a plain white one.
7534141	7535002	Whoop-de-doo, right?
7535802	7542725	So apparently that's the road they're going down for whatever this next Xbox is, is that one will be a...
7543405	7570899	Pairdown system to be released as cheaply as possible positioned more along the lines of a set-top box because 360 as a Netflix viewing device is apparently a huge deal and perhaps a Kinect-themed gaming portal but then there will be a more fully-featured machine with an optical drive hard disk and backward compatibility aimed at the hardcore would be released at a higher price point listen to that again
7571823	7579346	There's going to be a... Maybe, if rumors are to be believed, and there's going to be rumors or anything at this point, but maybe there's going to be an Xbox with no drive.
7579906	7582667	Dude, I don't buy that there's not going to be drive in there.
7582767	7584448	Optical drives are so fucking cheap.
7584568	7587489	It's just... Why would you do that?
7587749	7593631	I mean, because basically you're forcing people to buy the product online.
7593691	7595912	I mean, that's really the way they want to go with it, and fine.
7596252	7597973	But really, no optical drive?
7597993	7598173	I mean...
7598593	7599974	DVD drives?
7600414	7602115	Okay, let's assume that it's going to be a Blu-ray drive.
7602695	7606077	Blu-ray drives are not incredibly expensive anymore.
7606257	7609539	I mean, they're not as cheap as DVD drives, that's for sure.
7610459	7612760	You can get a Blu-ray player now for, what, $80, $100?
7613681	7615402	I can't imagine that those drives are that expensive.
7615422	7617123	Those things used to be $400 or $500.
7617363	7620424	Of course, same thing could be said about DVD players.
7620464	7623506	I remember a time when a DVD player was like, that's the thing the rich kids had.
7625737	7628298	I mean, hey, whatever.
7628619	7629019	That's fine.
7629079	7629939	They're giving you options.
7630400	7635923	So you don't have to buy the cheap, cheap, cheap one if you really want to.
7636463	7639545	So obviously a lot of this is still to be unveiled.
7639625	7645708	Another rumor is that Kinect will likely get a significant upgrade and be bundled with the console.
7646589	7647389	That all makes sense.
7647409	7651151	I mean, I think Kinect is something Microsoft's kind of embedded in their...
7653854	7655275	It'll get better.
7655295	7655996	It'll be interesting.
7656016	7657498	Yeah, the technology will get better, that's for sure.
7677213	7678454	But then here's the other thing.
7678474	7680575	Can I tell you the thing that bothers me most about this story?
7681715	7685657	As that it's called two Xbox 720 models reportedly planned.
7685717	7686898	Okay, seriously?
7687658	7691860	We need to stop calling it the Xbox 720 because that is a stupid name.
7692200	7693641	It's not going to be called the Xbox 720.
7694181	7695002	Why would you call it that?
7697185	7700807	The Xbox 360 did not come after the Xbox 359, okay?
7701488	7705370	It's not, you know, and I get it, 360 times 2 is 720, but you know what?
7706150	7709832	Something tells me they're going to just go another direction with the name.
7710832	7713013	As to what direction they're going to go with the name?
7714354	7721838	Well, we thought we would bring back one of our old friends to help us figure that out, what exactly that name could be.
7722478	7726060	And that is a segment on the show we like to call ListList!
7730322	7737287	That's right, tonight's listless topic is what should we refer to the new Xbox as?
7737767	7739468	What should the new Xbox be called?
7739568	7741830	What should we refer to it as here on the program?
7741970	7744252	Because we're not calling it the Xbox 720 anymore.
7744612	7747474	So what should the new name for the Xbox be?
7748150	7752154	2, or whatever it's going to be, or I guess it would really be Xbox 3, what should it be called?
7753255	7760160	So, if you want to give us suggestions, you can in our chatroom at chat.orange.com, but this is a highly scientific process, people.
7760440	7764124	Here's the way the list works if you've never listened to Listless before on the show.
7765004	7767126	We're each going to go around and give our top three answers.
7767166	7769607	That'll come up with a list of nine, since we have no guests tonight.
7769667	7771188	Usually it's a list of 12, not tonight.
7771788	7774970	But then we're each going to go around and take one off the list.
7775051	7775991	Oh, that's the hard part.
7776271	7782575	That'll leave a list of six, which you guys will go around and vote on your number one and number two answers for.
7782595	7787919	And we're going to get a definitive answer for what should the new Xbox be called.
7788959	7789239	All right.
7790901	7794164	So chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to give our suggestions.
7794184	7794545	Excuse me.
7794565	7794865	I forgot that.
7794905	7795726	It doesn't work tonight.
7797027	7800311	Channel Orange Lounge on IRC Game Search if you want to give your suggestions.
7800951	7802974	Let's start building the list.
7803134	7804835	So we will start with Loki tonight.
7806604	7809466	Your number three answer, what should they call the new Xbox?
7809586	7811288	Or what should we refer to it as here on the show?
7811448	7819735	Well, the way they have been changing their naming schemes for things, like especially Windows operating systems and stuff, before it used to be Windows 95, Vista, and they'd have funky names.
7820135	7822537	Now it's Windows 7, and they're talking about Windows 8.
7823397	7825899	So I'm just going to say Microsoft Xbox 3.
7825939	7827601	When I close my eyes...
7829122	7834047	Because it's simplified, I know it makes no sense, 363, but whatever.
7834207	7836309	So you're just going to call it the Xbox 3?
7836469	7836829	Xbox 3.
7837109	7837430	Why not?
7837450	7838451	It works for PlayStation.
7839011	7839412	Why not?
7840192	7840573	Alright.
7841253	7847219	Let's go to DarkSakura, your number 3 answer for what should the new Xbox be referred to as here on the program.
7847239	7847699	Xbox 420.
7847739	7847979	Xbox 420.
7850181	7854665	I wonder what this system does.
7855666	7858108	Oh man, suddenly I want to eat some Cheetos.
7858928	7863792	What do you want to play?
7864473	7867295	Why is Cheech and Chong suddenly the spokespeople for this system?
7867315	7869757	Or I guess now it's Harold and Kumar, I guess.
7870734	7872316	The new Muppets movie was so fucking awesome.
7889355	7890056	DarkSakura.com
7904651	7907332	I'm just saying, the new Muppets movie is really fucking good.
7907692	7911313	It's a little bit hokey because it's a kid's movie, but it's great.
7911333	7913313	Well, when someone buys my ticket, I'll go see it.
7913773	7914413	What cameo?
7915854	7916534	Line for what?
7916594	7919655	Okay, he's now the announcer for California Screamin'.
7920095	7924956	So he does the safety announcement kind of like a fair barker.
7925636	7928720	and then when you're in... Sorry, Rob.
7928760	7932324	Sorry, it's a name suggested in chat.
7932384	7936188	You in the chat can't influence the list because I just saw a name in there I am fucking taking for the list.
7937171	7943294	So when you're actually in the thing ready to go, it says, Second thoughts?
7943554	7944195	Too late!
7944875	7946676	5, 4, 3, 2, 1, boom!
7947997	7948717	Nice.
7948777	7949978	So it makes it all the way better.
7950198	7950938	Alright, back to the list.
7951739	7953980	So far we have Microsoft Xbox 3 and Xbox 420.
7954520	7957702	Now, I have to explain this name a little bit.
7957762	7960724	My name is the DexBox.
7961738	7962659	The Dex Box.
7963380	7966943	Because Dex is short for what in Dungeons & Dragons speak?
7967103	7967904	Dexterity.
7968364	7971147	That's something that thieves have a high amount of.
7971967	7973308	So it's the Dex Box.
7974970	7976331	And so be it, Microsoft.
7976371	7977752	Dex Box steal from you.
7979314	7979654	You know what?
7979714	7980555	I always played Rangers.
7982217	7985620	The Microsoft Dex Box is my answer.
7985680	7987701	Let's go to Loki for your number two answer.
7989587	7991770	I'm trying to think of really stupid Microsoft names.
7995854	7996534	Let's see.
7997335	7999777	The Microsoft Windows 8 Entertainment System.
8000658	8003101	Yes, it's very generic and stupid, but you know what?
8003161	8005523	It's something that sounds like it could be a Microsoft product.
8006444	8008346	The Windows 8 Entertainment System.
8008366	8009327	So we'd call it the latest?
8012870	8013471	Waiters!
8015754	8017856	There's a fly in my soup, waiters!
8020159	8024104	Only if Harvey Fierstein can be the spokesperson for the waiters.
8025065	8027649	I've got to call my mother and tell her to get a waiters.
8031661	8034482	You could have been a doctor, but instead you're a waiters.
8036423	8037204	I don't know why.
8038124	8042706	When I hear the name waiters, I think about Hire Me Fierce Team, but it just works, doesn't it?
8044767	8046308	I could have retired in a bloke.
8046668	8049269	The waiters, it has high definition connect.
8053411	8054032	That's awesome.
8056493	8058374	It can see how big your wiener is.
8060355	8061135	It's the weightest.
8062136	8063617	And I'll tell you, eight isn't enough.
8065578	8065958	Okay.
8066518	8067159	Moving on.
8068780	8071741	DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?
8072201	8072782	ZuneBox.
8073302	8074803	I almost said your number eight pick.
8075043	8076644	Your number two pick, ZuneBox.
8076824	8077344	ZuneBox.
8077664	8078505	Oh, ZuneBox.
8079085	8084809	X, U, N, E, V, O, X You want to spell it with an X instead of a Z?
8085890	8087191	Oh, okay.
8088471	8089312	No, I like it.
8089412	8090593	It's like Shusha.
8091613	8093335	Or you can spell it with a Z, that's fine.
8093355	8095616	Yeah, spell it with a Z, because that's what the thing is.
8095676	8097457	I don't know, I was just in the X thing.
8097658	8101400	Okay, Zunebox, even though I think Microsoft retired the Zune some time ago.
8101420	8103101	They have the whole Zune thing.
8103201	8105363	Okay, Zunebox, I can see that.
8105883	8108225	Maybe the Zune could be saved.
8109266	8114244	Cause it's cooler to have it Zoom bar Oh sorry, no dash Yeah that's how I would brand it If they would hire me
8116383	8117723	Damn it, Microsoft.
8117823	8121844	You should hire me to be your designer because I'm amazing and I make all your stuff look like Apple stuff.
8125044	8125405	All right.
8126445	8127085	Let's move on.
8127145	8128365	My number two answer.
8129585	8130445	I'm going to just put this.
8130505	8133986	This is the rumored name and I do like this as a name for the system.
8134186	8139407	And just in case this really is the name, I would like to be able to say we were right and we called it on the list.
8139447	8144468	So I'm going to put Xbox Loop on the list because Loop is the rumored name or at least the working title.
8145868	8147309	That's a stupid name.
8148130	8149391	Well, it makes sense, though.
8149931	8150771	360 and then Loop.
8150872	8151412	I don't know.
8151532	8152152	Xbox Loop.
8153093	8155635	It makes me think back to the books I was reading.
8155715	8158537	Spiral, Loop, and then... Alright.
8158917	8167903	So that means that some crazy-ass dead girl is going to climb out of my Xbox Loop when I don't change a disc for seven days.
8167923	8171666	And that's how they'll market it, is that, you know, in seven days, this machine will kill you.
8172099	8172419	All right.
8173540	8175120	Number one answer time.
8175480	8177461	Loki, number one for the list.
8178782	8179302	Let's see.
8182703	8184864	I'm going to do... Let's see.
8184884	8189086	The Microsoft... The Microsoft teabag rage quit...
8191227	8202561	Racial Slur The Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, wherever did that name come from?
8203822	8204864	They named it after the players.
8208226	8213568	We took your feedback and we've incorporated it into the name of our new machine.
8214108	8220570	We have an algorithm running that monitors all sorts of voice communication over the system.
8221030	8226912	And it's generated the perfect name for our system based off of the language that is used the most.
8228512	8230353	It's the Microsoft T-Bag Racial Slur.
8232313	8233875	or the MTRs.
8235977	8236297	Okay.
8237959	8240481	DarkSakura, your number one answer.
8240582	8241683	It's completely stupid.
8241743	8242624	It's X-Rombus.
8243845	8247008	Because I would really like to see them make something in the shape of a rhomboid.
8248670	8248970	All right.
8249010	8250051	All diagonal and shit.
8251292	8270108	Okay, I'm going to say for my number one answer, okay, originally I was going to do the Xbox Penetrator, which I still like as a name, but I got to say I was won over by something that was suggested in chat because somebody brought up an old ass OLR joke that's seriously like seven years old at this point.
8270648	8273651	So I give props to, I think it was SSJ100 Matt that said it.
8274051	8275514	Yeah, it was SSJ100Matt that said it.
8275614	8278099	I'm gonna go with his answer for my number one.
8278499	8281926	The Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.
8288632	8291173	Because this robot's for the good guys, we promise.
8291893	8294994	As these devices in our living room become more self-aware.
8295054	8297815	The Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.
8298355	8298695	Alright.
8300036	8301296	This is a really shitty list.
8302016	8302776	It is.
8303056	8304037	This is one of our worst.
8304457	8306077	Alright, at least we got Harvey Fierstein.
8306117	8310719	Alright, so we have the Microsoft Xbox 3, the Xbox 420, the DexBox...
8314840	8331027	The Waiters, the Windows 8 Entertainment System, the ZuneBox, the Xbox Loop, the Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, the X-Rombus, and the Xbox Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.
8332547	8340714	I think what I'm going to do, just because we don't have a fourth person with us tonight doing this with us, I'm going to go with one I'm seeing in chat a lot and just add it to the list.
8341194	8345438	I'm going to go with the Xbox Lube, which I'm seeing in the chat several times.
8345478	8347960	And I think that's off a mispronunciation I made.
8347980	8349381	Let's call Dan in to pick one, too.
8349621	8357108	A couple weeks ago on the show, I think I said I was talking about the Lube, and I think I accidentally said the Xbox Lube or something like that.
8357508	8359029	And so everybody's like, let's call it that.
8359950	8360430	So fine.
8360450	8360851	You're ready.
8367316	8373642	Time to open up some room in your entertainment system.
8373962	8375083	Dan's voting for waiters.
8375664	8375944	Alright.
8377485	8377926	Forget it.
8378086	8378906	We gotta go to the next phase.
8378926	8380568	Alright, we added one based on chats.
8380588	8381748	We added Xbox Lube.
8382009	8383029	So now we have a list of ten.
8383310	8385351	We're gonna take this down to a list of seven.
8385831	8389314	Sadly, it's time to start eliminating things from the list.
8390555	8392356	Loki, oh wait, let me read you the list so far.
8392616	8394478	Oh wait, I already did.
8394698	8396339	Sorry, I'm just excited.
8396359	8397159	Do you need more soda?
8397219	8398801	The Xbox Lube gets me excited.
8398841	8400202	What's wrong, Rob?
8402283	8402903	Waiters!
8403504	8404444	I need more sugar!
8406125	8407186	You're my sugar!
8408767	8410668	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8410808	8411569	DexFox.
8413150	8414671	You didn't like my dexterity joke?
8415551	8418013	It's stretching it.
8418413	8418573	Oh!
8418973	8419894	It's stretching it!
8422976	8425137	Yet another catchphrase for the Xbox lube.
8428914	8433798	Stretching the bounds of your imagination Can you take this all in?
8435038	8448108	Alright We have to take it slow DarkSakura Just try to relax DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8448493	8461198	It's nothing against you, Rob, but I'm taking off Xbox Loop because I think it's... I hope that's not the official name and I wouldn't want it to be associated with the official name.
8461278	8463639	Alright, so the Xbox Loop comes off the list.
8463719	8465880	Dang, you guys eliminated almost my whole list.
8465920	8467780	Alright, well I'm not taking my own answer off.
8467800	8468921	I've got to leave at least one up there.
8469762	8474126	So the one I'm going to take off, I'm going to take off Microsoft Xbox 3.
8474507	8475708	It's just stupid.
8476068	8477850	Yeah, the PlayStation does that.
8477870	8478111	Come on.
8478471	8482976	I am making the chatters be more creative tonight than pick that answer.
8483617	8483937	All right.
8484998	8485599	So here it is.
8486599	8489001	This is the official list that you can vote on.
8490202	8491303	I wonder what's going to win.
8491643	8496306	Your number one and number two answers are welcome through private message to Sky in the chat room right now.
8496386	8496806	Here it is.

8510735	8515836	Send a private message to Sky with your votes for number one and number two answers.

8522018	8524058	And of course, now everybody is coming up.
8524198	8525278	Everybody's a comic now.
8525458	8526539	Actdeft in our chat room.
8526739	8528519	Xbox Lube, get ready to stretch.
8528859	8531020	Hecht, Xbox Lube, we're stretching it.
8531440	8536161	Dungeon Buster gives new meaning to the term Red Ring of Death.
8542058	8542899	Oh, we're so mature.
8543339	8543660	All right.
8545102	8548405	I'm glad you guys decided on some highbrow entertainment for your day.
8549647	8549907	All right.
8549987	8551829	Sadly, there's no mailbag tonight.
8553171	8554453	Sadly.
8556255	8558798	But there's always time for some FUs of the week.
8574788	8588489	FU to Stuff and Things and the Stuff and Things are actually Stuff and Things that I'm not at liberty to openly discuss and then FU to I'm going to get political here
8589662	8602326	F you to people who vote a straight party ticket and F you to people in high positions who think they can cheat and get away with it because they have cheated and gotten away with it.
8602566	8604106	People wonder why everyone's so pissed.
8604546	8604726	Done.
8607011	8611555	Fuck you to the local news stations for counting down to Black Friday.
8612636	8613577	It was so annoying.
8613657	8615578	It's 11 o'clock and there are people lined up.
8615838	8618140	Yes, people line up every single year.
8618320	8619441	It's not fucking news.
8620642	8622964	Don't be amazed that people are lined up for sales.
8623285	8624786	They do it all the damn time.
8627846	8650801	F you to the fact that my vacation from work is almost over I mean I like my job and all but I really like sitting at home on my ass doing nothing and then F you to the fact that I'm like really getting hungry but I have a lovely dinner that Alan's been working on literally all day in the crock pot waiting for me when I get home so I have that to look forward to but in the meantime god damn I want a donut F you to donuts for being delicious
8651061	8653762	Fuck you to Krispy Kreme not being in Northern California.
8654042	8655483	I get Krispy Kreme in two months.
8655703	8657604	F you to Krispy Kreme not being next door.
8658064	8659385	I get Krispy Kreme in two months.
8659405	8660305	Did you work that all out?
8660905	8661105	Huh?
8661986	8663666	Well, that's still the goal time.
8663786	8664127	Gotcha.
8665007	8665227	All right.
8665247	8667608	Well, let's go back to some gaming news.
8667788	8669849	And then the Skype line is coming up real soon.
8669869	8671210	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8671230	8674191	But not yet because we still have a few more stories to get through starting with Loki.
8674531	8682794	Yes, we were talking about new Xbox systems, and, well, this is something that is kind of branching out the Kinect a little bit.
8683335	8684435	Kinect for Windows.
8684955	8690337	It's going to be using a new Kinect camera, because before I was like, well, you've got to sit eight feet away from your damn computer to use this thing.
8690737	8699401	But, no, they're actually going to include a firmware that's going to support a new near mode that's designed to see objects as close as 50 centimeters away from the camera.
8700302	8715700	and I guess also they're launching with this in early 2012 a Kinect Accelerator program which will give $20,000 each to 10 startups using Kinect along with Microsoft development tools.
8716861	8718863	Marketing Visibility, and Mentoring.
8718883	8724847	So it'll be interesting to see what they use Kinect for the PC.
8724927	8731411	And obviously maybe we'll see this integrated into laptops and stuff like that.
8731852	8734814	So it might be interesting to see how this evolves.
8737320	8740781	One other thing I was going to mention, too, is kind of a story that we got left out.
8741621	8751243	There's a rumor that Microsoft is in the early stages of licensing with Sony for a Kinect-enabled TV.
8751424	8752884	Oh, yeah, I had heard about that.
8753124	8756225	Obviously, it's supposed to be, I would imagine, some sort of like...
8758126	8760789	I don't know, maybe some sort of web-enabled TV.
8760809	8767396	You know how they have the enhanced TVs now where you can browse content online, maybe different apps.
8767857	8772802	Maybe that's how you'll browse through movies, doing Netflix and that kind of stuff through a TV.
8774024	8774905	Be interesting to see that.
8775385	8776266	That actually happened.
8776326	8782750	It would also be weird to see Sony partnering with Microsoft on something.
8782950	8792696	I would think it's somewhat inevitable that the next Xbox whatever we're going to end up calling it which we'll find out here in a minute could have Blu-ray in it.
8793016	8803103	I would think they'd go with a proprietary disc but maybe if it's really supposed to be the whole Netflix I would think Blu-ray because they're going to try to get in on that.
8803323	8805564	So they're going to have to kind of partner with Sony for that anyway.
8806044	8807464	So it could be interesting.
8809205	8810125	It could be very interesting.
8810205	8812926	Anyway, you give us Blu-ray and we'll give you Kinect.
8813986	8815807	Are you interested in Kinect for Windows at all, Loki?
8817107	8819448	No, because I work on my laptop mostly.
8819608	8823589	So, I mean, hell, I don't use Kinect anyways on my 360.
8824589	8832832	Did you see that super fuzzy-wuzzy feel-good commercial that Extifer had posted on his Facebook where he's like, I really like the music in this.
8834293	8835294	I've seen that before.
8835394	8838977	It's basically an Apple commercial, but with Kinect.
8839278	8848506	I've seen that before, and it's a neat concept that they're showing these classrooms enabled with all these big projection screens and doing stuff.
8848566	8854231	It's just like the Cisco commercials that they have where there's kids in the U.S.
8854291	8858095	talking to kids in China through almost like a portal or whatever.
8858935	8888322	um you know like a some sort of webcam projection setup or whatever that they got but I mean I don't know it's a neat idea that they'll eventually do this stuff but and definitely with Connect for Windows and people creating new applications for it I could see more of that stuff coming about but it's I don't know it's too ideal for me idealistic I guess would be the word
8891917	8894559	Alright, I'm going to move on with another story here.
8894619	8898322	This is also the very, very, very, very, very last call for Cagematch.
8899363	8901225	Listless votes, because we're about done.
8903386	8907830	There's an interesting petition going on out there, and this is not... Okay, there's like two things going on right now.
8907870	8914495	There's a really funny thing going around Facebook, which is from like a parody site, which is about how Xbox is...
8915676	8917918	and all this stuff.
8917958	8919959	Skyrim is turning everybody gay and all this stuff.
8919979	8922201	You mean Skyrim job?
8922381	8923222	Exactly, something like that.
8923562	8925123	That was a really funny parody article.
8925163	8926705	It was on Christwire or something like that.
8926785	8929326	It's like an onion site for religious sites.
8929707	8932889	But anyway, what I really want to share is this is actually a serious thing.
8932929	8934510	This is a White House petition.
8934530	8938133	Because you know the WhiteHouse.gov website will let you do your own petition.
8938673	8941355	And somebody actually started one on there urging...
8943033	8948361	to ban the Elder Scrolls Skyrim for the safety of America's youths.
8949615	8954676	There were five backers that signed the petition at the time this was posted around gaming blogs.
8955056	8958317	Of course, tons more people have signed it as a joke or whatever after that.
8959157	8963398	But yeah, it's basically petitioning the Obama administration.
8963438	8964038	Let me read this.
8964158	8965239	Quote, No, it's not.
8974881	8981124	where sexual perversion and homosexuality are threatening to destroy the Christian foundations on which this nation was built.
8983445	8984005	Did you hear that?
8984066	8986587	My relationship is threatening America.
8987067	8987607	You know what?
8987627	8989488	Do you feel threatened by my relationship?
8989888	8990569	Girl, no.
8991729	8995051	Well, you should be threatened because he knows how to cook.
8996792	8997072	Anyhow.
8997600	8999823	I'm totally not threatened because I want to come over for dinner.
9001284	9007831	Whereas a new video game has just been created that far exceeds any others in the psychological and spiritual damage it does to teens.
9008792	9011856	We ask you to ban Skyrim, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
9013898	9019484	I guess this petition may have actually been created by that same parody website.
9020768	9025612	But whatever, it's still interesting that you can post this out there and that it is on the official White House site.
9025913	9029215	And I bet you people signed that not knowing that it was parody.
9029576	9031978	I bet a lot of people signed it not knowing if it really was parody.
9032358	9033379	But they didn't really know that.
9033599	9034420	That's just sad.
9034820	9035021	Yeah.
9035701	9040605	So I want to create a petition banning online petitions.
9040665	9041346	How's that sound?
9042887	9042988	Cool.
9043008	9046671	If you want to petition for something, you go stand outside of a Walmart and get signatures.
9048089	9052122	I'd be like, hey, well, you know they did that on an episode of Bullshit.
9052744	9053065	Did they?
9053526	9054369	About, um...
9056389	9061894	Missguided patriotism and how people, if they hear certain keywords, will sign just about anything.
9063475	9064236	Protect children.
9064696	9073183	Yeah, but they actually did show that it was actually the majority of people who I think wouldn't actually sign it because they stopped to think about it.
9074324	9081730	But then again, they also had a petition out at a Greenpeace rally to ban H2O.
9084169	9085931	Oh, yeah, I think I remember something like that.
9085951	9086932	Like, it was, like, banned.
9087352	9090535	But, like, this chemical is in... And it was a chemical name, and it was, like, water.
9090855	9091035	Yeah.
9091135	9091335	Yeah.
9092516	9093617	Or soda or something like that, yeah.
9093637	9094158	No, it was water.
9094378	9094638	Was it?
9095038	9098221	But they were like, it's a dangerous chemical, and blah, blah, blah, blah, and, you know.
9098662	9099062	Gotcha.
9099843	9100163	Interesting.
9101144	9105527	All right, one more story from you, DarkSakura, and then it's almost time for the tweets at Twitter.
9105547	9106588	Like, dihydrogenoxide.
9106668	9108089	At twitter.com slash OLR.
9108109	9109591	Dihydrogen dioxide.
9110551	9110772	All right.
9110872	9111012	Yeah.
9112714	9113314	I'm being dumb.
9113474	9113694	Okay.
9114495	9115215	So I have another article.
9116776	9117536	Google Chrome.
9118076	9119297	Yay, Google Chrome.
9120077	9127160	Well, it's actually going to be adding in more hardware support to the browser, including using a gamepad.
9127820	9135323	So not only will you be able to play your games, you can play your games with your actual gamepad.
9136163	9139565	And that means it's going to be a lot more of these...
9141466	9144529	Web-only games should actually start being easier to play.
9144569	9148352	I mean, we might see a bit more development for new true console-style games.
9148392	9152316	I mean, we've already got a lot of NES games emulated in Flash.
9152976	9153537	We might see more.
9157435	9163319	I like the idea of gamepads in browsers, but that's just going to lead to even more of the emulation websites.
9163620	9164300	There's a little bit more.
9165121	9176088	Google's actually going to put in support for WebRTC, which is a video chat thing, but Firefox already has gamepad support for the record.
9176656	9187462	Can I actually say that I do really like, though, that, you know, we had a story last week or the week before or whenever we had a show about how, like, you can get demos for games through YouTube now.
9187522	9188583	Like, there was that FIFA game.
9188943	9196707	Like, so it would make a lot of sense that gamepads will be enabled within the browser because, like, a lot of stuff seems like it's going to be streaming, like, right through your browser.
9197127	9204531	And shit, people play the Facebook games and probably a Google Plus game is looking at using this if Google Chrome is launching it.
9204611	9204791	So...
9206472	9207052	It's interesting.
9207653	9210094	But yeah, that kind of support, I can support.
9210754	9210954	Ha!
9212414	9214075	Alright, let's see.
9214675	9219297	We're about to get to the Twitter and last minute stories, but I think we should do some listless results.
9219637	9222998	Shouldn't we find out what we're going to be calling the new Xbox officially?
9223319	9223779	Well, yeah.
9223979	9226140	Because you know, after tonight, it's no more Xbox 720.
9226740	9228200	We will be calling it by this name.
9228361	9230041	The bend over and take it like a man.
9230701	9231562	Let's find out.
9231642	9234623	Let's see if... Let's see who got their way.
9237694	9241615	In at number three is a tie.
9241635	9241955	Uh-oh.
9241995	9253818	The number three answer for what we should call the new system, the Xbox 420, because, you know, we have a few stoners in our chat, and the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.
9253918	9253998	Yeah.
9254018	9256539	You're tied for your number three answer.
9257359	9264261	The number two thing you most want to call the new Xbox is the Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.
9264881	9265942	Yay!
9266963	9268945	And the number one answer.
9269505	9270286	Can I put it this way?
9270346	9271687	It got twice as many votes.
9271947	9272988	And no one's surprised.
9273308	9280695	The number one answer, the Xbox Lube, is the official name of the new Xbox console.
9280755	9282316	Congratulations, chatterers.
9282356	9285059	Congratulations, Microsoft and the Xbox Lube.
9285959	9287160	Do you think you can handle it?
9288747	9291249	I think it should be bend over and take it like a man.
9291269	9295371	They're very narrowly missing the list, by the way.
9295451	9297252	Waiters didn't make the top three.
9297272	9297852	Did you notice that?
9298472	9299473	That's poopy.
9299913	9303255	Even after my Harvey Fierstein impersonation, waiters missed the list.
9303275	9304235	I think that might have hurt it.
9304275	9304776	That might have hurt.
9304796	9305136	You're right.
9305176	9306217	It might have hurt its chances.
9306657	9308118	They were raised badly.
9309178	9310559	Them others didn't do their job.
9312322	9313262	Alright, so there it is.
9313342	9320544	The Xbox Lube is the official new title of the Xbox console and here on the show, here in chat, and hopefully soon across the entirety of the internet.
9320564	9321564	Can we call it the Xbloob?
9322504	9326966	Sure, we can call it the Xbloob and other fun creations there will be Xbox Lube.
9327786	9330967	Alright, let's get to last minute stories.
9331087	9335888	I don't know, again, we were in an interesting situation this week because we lost the usual way we prep the show.
9336628	9337868	So does anybody have anything they want to add?
9337888	9341049	DarkSakura, were there any stories that you wanted to get to that we didn't
9341400	9342280	No, not really.
9342560	9344241	Well, actually, hold on, there was one.
9344741	9345362	Loki, do one.
9345562	9346342	Okay, Loki, do one.
9346382	9348063	Hopefully it's not the same story or you're screwed.
9348923	9352924	South Korea has put into effect what they're calling the Cinderella Law.
9353665	9366049	Basically, they're working with their internet providers that they're going to block players from under 16 from playing between midnight and 6 a.m.
9367350	9370671	on online services such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
9372828	9373128	What?
9374049	9374910	It is in Korea.
9375711	9377933	Well, didn't they ban MMOs too?
9378393	9378593	Yes.
9378613	9380134	Was that South or North that did that?
9380154	9380695	South Korea.
9381576	9382737	Okay.
9383217	9384078	Okay, I've got a couple.
9385319	9388782	One of them is that Microsoft bought a video surf to use on Xbox Live.
9389914	9390715	What's VideoSurf do?
9390815	9406189	It's a search engine, but it's saying that the overtime technology, it says it's supposed to be integrated with Xbox Live, and that you can use it to search for TV, film, across several Xbox Live applications.
9406730	9409192	Love Film, Zune, etc.,
9410833	9434877	the US will okay in the UK they're getting BBC content and the US will get Bravo, Comcast, HBO Go, Verizon, FIOS and Syfy we're gonna get Bravo yeah I know I was like I can't wait for the real housewives of you know Boulder Colorado or wherever they're gonna go next
9435603	9456117	And then, um, I, you probably said something about this on, um, Horde House Yes, I did, but go ahead Yeah, about the, uh, talent calculator being live for Mists of Pandaria Or as I call it, MOP Which is notable because the game itself shouldn't be out for at least another six months, if not more like nine to twelve So it's interesting that the talent calculator's already out there
9456559	9460084	So you can see how talented you want to be at mopping.
9460926	9461406	There you go.
9462888	9463369	Loki?
9463589	9465492	Oh, the calculator for monk is not available.
9466133	9467755	Right, because they don't want to give everything away.
9468336	9468617	Yeah.
9469967	9471068	A few things.
9471829	9483261	There was supposed to be a lawsuit against EA for reneging on the fact that Battlefield 1943 didn't come with Battlefield 3 or something like that.
9485263	9488426	So now they're going to be giving away The other way around, by the way.
9488966	9497552	They're going to be giving away Battlefield 1943 vouchers to everybody that bought the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3.
9499413	9503396	To redeem this, you have to go to their portal, which is 1943redemption.battlefield.com
9506198	9506639	DarkSakura.com
9527501	9529703	So that's good that they finally came through with that.
9529743	9531746	Unfortunately, it took a lot to do that.
9531766	9535269	I'm not sure if we reported on this before, but the same thing happened with Saints Row the 3rd.
9535309	9539634	They were supposed to be getting exclusive content for Saints Row the 3rd, and THQ came now.
9540494	9540915	If you...
9542356	9563191	Sign up if you log in your online pass that comes with the new copies of Saints Row 3, or if you buy the game and buy the online pass, if you buy the game used and buy the online pass, as long as you redeem that pass, I forget what the time frame is, you get a free copy or a free download of Saints Row 2 on the PlayStation 3, which is pretty awesome.
9563211	9563772	Yeah, I heard about that.
9565913	9567033	Definitely worth checking that out.
9568534	9573095	Cthulhu Saves the World Bundle has sold 100,000 copies on Steam.
9573235	9576455	How many did they sell on Xbox Live Arcade or indie games?
9576535	9579976	Indie games, they have only moved 55,000 to date.
9580796	9582877	And that's been available since December 2010.
9582917	9584977	Sadly, that's still more than I would have thought.
9588742	9608398	and uh actually wait a second here I'm sorry uh Breath of Death that was Breath of Death 7 has been uh available since April 2010 on Xbox Live Indie Games and has moved 55,000 copies uh to date Cthulhu uh Saves the World has been available since December 2010 and has only generated uh 20,000 downloads yikes
9612001	9619568	And apparently, I don't know when it went up on Steam, but they sold 100,000 copies.
9620669	9621729	Oh, since July.
9622430	9622990	July.
9623951	9624532	So, yeah.
9625312	9625973	Big difference there.
9626233	9635761	Apparently, their next title that they're working on is actually was the once-canceled Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness, Episode 3.
9636462	9637443	Oh, interesting.
9637863	9639084	So these guys picked it up.
9639604	9639805	Yeah.
9639845	9639945	Huh.
9641186	9668307	um so it's interesting um also uh what's also interesting Elder Scrolls Skyrim has uh much of the uh I guess uh land of uh Tamriel from uh was it uh yeah there was a video of that up of the guy uh no clipping right yeah from Morrowind um and people are assuming that's just from uh cause the way they display the map or whatever that they just wanted to be complete um
9669096	9670276	It's still neat either way.
9671257	9680940	And of course, Skyrim got a patch on PC, but what's kind of annoying is that they added mandatory Steam DRM.
9681680	9684401	And they've also killed some of the tweaks that you can do in the game.
9685642	9686882	So, that kind of sucks.
9688419	9696045	and then last but not least, new dashboard update for the Xbox 360 has been dated for December 6th.
9696245	9697986	Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of big news we missed, huh?
9698386	9710315	And that of course will be bringing cloud storage as well as the beacon support which is I believe live already on Xbox.com Isn't that kind of like the don't you want to play these games with me type of thing?
9710515	9713277	Yeah, like you go, hey, I'm playing Call of Duty later today.
9713377	9714378	And so you can see that.
9714398	9715479	That's kind of cool, I guess.
9715719	9716039	Something.
9717500	9718181	So they have that.
9718401	9721243	And also, of course, the redesign to make it look like Windows Phone 7.
9722584	9722764	Boo.
9723605	9724786	Let's open up the Skype line.
9724966	9727248	We're ready to take your calls.

9739998	9743161	So definitely use Skype if you're somewhere else.
9743341	9745383	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.
9745884	9748326	Meanwhile, we have just a couple of tweets for you.
9748346	9750488	We didn't get a whole lot tonight, but just a couple.
9751108	9755132	We'll start here with a link from Tiger Claw on Twitter sent us.
9755972	9757353	A reminder, I did read about this earlier.
9757373	9764558	I didn't make the show roll tonight, but he reminds us just in time for Christmas, the Batcave will be Arkham City's newest challenge map.
9764898	9768481	So there is going to be some DLC that hits, and I think the date was December 20th.
9768581	9771003	Yeah, December 20th is going to be a new DLC pack.
9771043	9775786	Of course, this is for Arkham City, and it's actually going to be a Batcave challenge map.
9776106	9780069	It's also going to contain the Iceberg Lounge and Joker's Carnival.
9780529	9782651	So yeah, that's going to be coming out December 20th.
9783231	9786054	Didn't the Robin pack hit this week?
9786935	9787135	Yeah.
9787695	9789017	I've got to check that out.
9789257	9794522	Because, yeah, I don't know much about what's supposed to be in that Robin pack, except, well, of course, Robin.
9794562	9795363	You can play as Robin.
9796304	9799507	I wonder if they integrate him into the story like they do Catwoman.
9799567	9802189	I think he's supposed to be integrated into the story.
9802209	9802930	That's kind of rad.
9802970	9803851	I might have to check that out.
9804572	9804752	Yeah.
9806417	9811982	All right, again, the phone is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or as your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9812522	9815384	We are getting a call, so let's go to the phones.
9815465	9816766	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9816806	9817186	Who's this?
9818827	9819668	It's Jester Scott.
9820068	9821770	Jester Scott, welcome to the show.
9824032	9824192	Hi.
9824412	9824652	Hi.
9824852	9825533	What's on your mind, buddy?
9826894	9828675	I have a couple of things.
9829656	9831318	I think that y'all were talking about the
9832113	9833856	GameStop stickers one time.
9834116	9836520	How they've gotten a little bit better from being so sticky.
9837902	9841228	And, um... Well, I bought Zelda.
9841829	9843149	I think you were saying something about this, Loki.
9843169	9846250	You used to be able to very carefully take those things off and you could put it back on.
9846270	9848110	I think we had a guest or somebody was saying something about that.
9848210	9849231	No, that wasn't me.
9849271	9849591	All right.
9866494	9873360	Right, well, normally the new stickers can come off very easily now I'm still leaving that sticky residue, right?
9873380	9880246	Well, I go to take off my sticker on the Zelda copy that I got Well, the front of it's foil Guess what came off?
9893001	9893402	The Foil
9901075	9902195	Well, you know what that means.
9902275	9903956	They were on to our schemes.
9904056	9910777	They started reading the internet and they knew that people were just opening them and then trying to return them like they were new.
9911117	9914837	But you know what?
9914857	9917358	They deserve it for that crappy policy anyway.
9918318	9918938	But whatever.
9919678	9925459	I don't even know why I'm trying to sell it like new.
9925499	9928520	You had actually pre-ordered Zelda and you still got a copy like that?
9930074	9931215	It wasn't in the shrink wrap?
9932436	9933316	Oh, no, no, no.
9933776	9934817	It was sealed and everything.
9934837	9937478	It just still had that big-ass sticker on the front of the box.
9939359	9945442	Oh, and so now when you took it off, now your box has it, and you won't be able to sell it on eBay or anything, huh?
9946843	9947083	No.
9947503	9948884	Well, I wasn't going to sell it anyway.
9948904	9950405	It's just an eye sore.
9950645	9952906	So they had a sticker underneath the shrink wrap?
9954227	9955668	No, no, no.
9955728	9956348	The box to Zelda...
9958642	9964025	It was kind of like the 25th anniversary for Mario, only the whole box didn't have a flap.
9964045	9964325	I getcha.
9964365	9968046	Yeah, the front of that foil and the big old sticker they had on it took off.
9983408	9991232	Well, let me go this direction because you've actually played the new Zelda then, which is something, despite all the other games that are out right now, we haven't had a chance to play.
9991572	9992772	How do you like the new Zelda game?
9994093	9995294	Oh my god.
9996334	9997935	I think it's amazing.
9998195	9999075	Yeah?
9999435	10001376	Yes, the controls are a little finicky.
10002717	10008279	You have to get used to it because it fully uses the Wii Motion Plus or motion controls, whatever it is.
10009720	10009860	Um...
10012228	10013429	It goes in a different direction.
10013509	10017690	Yes, the graphics are a little toned down, but the game is very, very long.
10018130	10026713	I've got 30 hours into it and either I really suck or this game is extremely long.
10027093	10029754	How is it different from Twilight Princess, would you say?
10031334	10033555	Well, I didn't play very much of Twilight Princess.
10033655	10034555	I know, gamer Shane.
10036796	10040297	But I don't know.
10040537	10041097	It's just like
10041764	10052590	Any move you make with your Wiimote link on the screen will make that movement.
10054511	10061375	It's kind of funny because if you're sitting down playing Zelda, he kind of holds his sword out.
10061895	10063436	He looks retarded on the screen.
10063536	10067338	He's just running around with his sword straight up in the air or straight in front of him.
10069180	10069900	But it will just
10070794	10073435	It'll mimic the movement of your hand, literally.
10073675	10079077	So it sounds like the Wii Motion Plus really added a lot more than maybe sometimes we give it credit for.
10079157	10081618	The extra technology really kind of added a lot to it.
10083099	10085920	Yeah, and I've been reading a little bit of hate of that online.
10086260	10088841	You know, like, oh, well, but it's Zelda.
10088861	10090421	Why can't they just do it for a controller?
10090941	10096884	Well, if you think about it, with every Zelda game, well, nearly every Zelda game, they've done something different.
10097464	10097744	Mm-hmm.
10099298	10101559	So, I mean, the first one was a top view.
10102140	10106262	The second one had a top view, but it would also go into side scrolling.
10106943	10110245	So, I mean, just keep going from there.
10110465	10117209	Besides, most of the guys playing this game, their right hand should be in fine shape anyway to wag it around, right?
10118589	10118950	Yeah.
10119070	10119350	All right.
10119970	10123632	Well, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for the call and enjoy Zelda, okay?
10124773	10125333	All right, I will.
10125474	10126134	All right, have a good one.
10127869	10132177	Later, 1877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10132217	10133119	I think that was a new caller.
10133199	10134101	I don't recognize that name.
10134481	10137628	I recognize it from chat right now, but I don't think that person's called in before.
10137928	10139752	I heard a little southern accent, didn't you?
10140578	10140979	Yeah, a little.
10141099	10141539	I heard a little.
10141960	10142200	All right.
10142721	10144963	Anyhow, moving on, going back to the Twitters.
10145504	10146805	DarkTetsuya sends us a tweet.
10147126	10151150	Coming soon to Xbox Live Indie Games, Nyan Cat Adventure.
10151291	10153934	It is from the people behind Technokitten Adventure.
10154514	10157918	I guess they are actually creating a Nyan Cat game.
10158699	10162441	Um, there's already a Nyan Cat game for iPhone.
10162461	10169185	There is on iPhone, but I guess this is the official quote-unquote one that's going to be on Xbox Live.
10169505	10170866	And I like the little box art.
10170906	10175969	They have a Facebook that has some limited pictures and stuff, but I love what they did at the bottom.
10176509	10183233	They made this rip-off of the Nintendo seal of quality, and it's the official Niantendo seal.
10184854	10187075	I hope they get that by the Xbox censors.
10188447	10211633	Nintendo 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio let's see more tweets oh I like this one from Mantis Knight on Twitter one topic please discuss is is free to play MMORPGs really a good thing?
10213934	10216575	are free to play MMOs really a good thing?
10216695	10217175	hell yes
10218786	10219868	Depends who it's good for.
10220149	10223214	As far as being good to get people to try your game, yes.
10224356	10228945	Whether people try your game and then decide to pay for stuff, maybe not.
10231761	10256842	I see no problem because I mean I was paying for Star Trek Online and then had cryptic points so no big there I've heard of where free to play has kind of driven games downhill though or at least according to some of the loyal people who play the game and like one example I could think of for that is Team Fortress 2 now note I'm not saying Team Fortress 2 is a bad game it's not it's a good game
10257343	10264125	But some people, you might remember we reported on this, when Team Fortress 2 first went free to play, the community was very against that.
10264768	10287311	and well some I should say some of the community was very against that in fact they went so far remember there were some servers that would ban you if it caught that you were using the free to play version like somehow they could tell the difference and it was like we don't want these people here and sometimes an MMO is like I can imagine a game like DC Universe like one day you're paying for DC Universe right you're paying your $15 a month suddenly the game goes free to play and
10287871	10292173	Now your servers are drowning under all the people that are trying to get on the server.
10292633	10298536	And it's like where it might be a good thing that more people are playing your game, now it's all these people who didn't pay anything to get in.
10298576	10301538	So it's kind of like they might be ruining the party a little bit.
10301618	10302218	Does that make sense?
10304749	10305890	Hey, this is Cloud Cleveland.
10305930	10307332	I haven't been in a chat for a long time.
10327449	10327890	Yo, bro.
10328191	10330678	Hey, Rob, you were a Rez fan, right?
10330838	10331700	For the little Dreamcast?
10331740	10332823	Freaking love Rez.
10333064	10334367	Happy 10-year anniversary.
10334748	10335330	Hell yeah.
10336300	10336821	I know, right?
10336881	10338462	Have you gotten to play Child of Eden yet?
10338942	10339223	I do.
10339403	10340564	I have played Child of Eden.
10340864	10344247	Child of Eden, I want to play it on the PlayStation 3, for real.
10345528	10348670	I liked it, but I thought the Kinect control was a little weird.
10348771	10352514	It was cool to play once, but I prefer just playing it with a controller.
10352914	10354936	And I didn't like the music as much as I liked Rez.
10355476	10357518	I really didn't, but it was still a good game.
10357538	10359019	I've heard a lot of people say that, actually, about the music.
10359339	10359600	Mm-hmm.
10361281	10384756	It's not that it was bad, it wasn't bad by any means I'm always going to love anything Tetsuya Mizuguchi puts out But it wasn't Rez And the price was tough to swallow But there's a lot of weird stuff that comes out for a high price At least it was better than 5 cars and 3 tracks It was a better game than that, that's for sure
10386878	10390059	Okay, maybe I'll wait for it to go budget title before I actually pick it up myself.
10390199	10391700	Well, there's a lot of Black Friday games.
10391720	10392440	My gosh, dude.
10394461	10398682	As I said, my god, Mario 3D Land.
10399302	10406045	You know, between that and Kirby Return to Dream Land, those two games have really put a lot of faith into Nintendo for me.
10406716	10407397	and DarkSakura.com
10425374	10426434	How many years has it been?
10426594	10427375	God damn.
10427455	10428015	Friend codes?
10428295	10429675	Why do we always hurt the ones we love?
10430576	10430816	Right?
10430896	10445260	But then they go and they put out fucking Mario 3D Land, this Kirby game, which I hear is really good, Zelda, and supposedly, assuming Mario Kart 7 is just as good, it's like, damn.
10445600	10446261	Thanks for watching!
10466008	10466469	Oh, I know.
10466569	10468572	I mean, now it's completely worth having the Wii for me.
10468592	10471977	I've actually pulled it out of my closet just to be able to play these games.
10472578	10476864	And thankfully, you know, the 3DS didn't have to wait as long for some decent games.
10477365	10479087	And hopefully this won't be the end of it.
10479778	10498486	Yeah it's interesting there's been other stories this week that you know Reggie is saying that just because the Wii U is coming out does not mean the Wii's life cycle is done and I think a lot of us are looking at that with kind of one eyebrow raise like how are the systems going to coexist and I think you kind of have to say that to some extent because like you don't want the Wii's to stop selling this holiday season.
10499586	10501767	I still think Xenoblade's gonna come out
10503048	10517689	I think that I always go back and forth with this I swore up and down that if they didn't announce it at Penny Arcade it wasn't fucking happening but I'm kind of like you know what else do they fucking have next year they've got to have almost all of their people working on making the Wii U
10518670	10518970	Better.
10519471	10521432	Because it's gotta be better at next year's E3.
10521472	10524094	I think you're gonna see a much different system at next E3.
10524775	10529038	And I don't mean like suddenly it's not gonna have a touch screen anymore or any of that stuff.
10529058	10533902	I just mean you're gonna definitely see the games and you're gonna see the reason why Nintendo really believes in this.
10533922	10534882	You're gonna see this at E3.
10534902	10537344	Because if they can't prove that, that system is fucked.
10538505	10545630	But I think because they've got all their people working to make the Wii U great...
10546527	10546647	Right.
10572253	10572894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10588471	10590613	You don't have to do a hardware modification to it.
10591454	10594798	Will the internet collectively still care this time next year?
10596259	10599462	Because especially a game like Xenoblade is really for the core gamer.
10599542	10602125	You can't sell Xenoblade to a soccer mom with her seven-year-olds.
10602986	10605909	But Xenoblade is a really good game that if you do own a Wii, you should check out.
10608158	10609679	Alright, I want to actually look into that one.
10609719	10610459	Thanks for the suggestion.
10610699	10626108	No problem, except for unless you happen to be in Europe, you won't find it here, or you're going to have to turn to the dark side of the internet, which SOPA may eliminate, so get it now while you still can.
10626388	10632131	I don't usually advocate piracy, but when a company leaves you no other choice to play the game, I don't know what else to tell people.
10632572	10633472	Xenoblade's a great game.
10634873	10635113	Alright.
10635862	10639546	Yeah, you can't get the licensing in your country or whatever.
10640927	10641688	Other options, man.
10642088	10642909	Yep.
10643449	10647273	All right, well, anything else you want to ask or get out with the show tonight?
10648974	10649875	No, that's about it, bro.
10650176	10653499	All right, well, thanks so much for your call, and have fun with Child of Eden.
10653519	10654039	You should get it.
10654780	10657182	You're going to see a lot of good sales through the holiday, so definitely check it out.
10659184	10659344	Right.
10659504	10660165	All right, take care, buddy.
10662192	10667145	One 877 game OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10668968	10669668	Love to hear from you.
10670049	10671469	Did I finish all the tweets or was there one?
10671529	10673110	Oh, we were still on the free-to-play thing.
10673690	10674571	We were talking about that.
10674811	10681974	And DarkSakura, you were talking about kind of even your experiences, you know, the Star Wars, or Star Trek, thank you.
10681994	10683015	I really should know better.
10683055	10686256	But it would just be certain things that I would want, and they would be very reasonable.
10686837	10695561	Like, I could get a thing of the lowest end of cryptic points or something, and it would last me through, like, months of releases.
10695821	10696021	Yeah.
10696321	10696481	So...
10699246	10703308	Since the phone's not ringing again, I think we're actually going to shut it down because believe it or not, this has been a long show tonight.
10704028	10707170	Especially considering our website is down and we weren't able to do a proper show roll.
10707630	10708690	We did a good job filling time.
10709231	10709991	So we've got to wrap up.
10710711	10711752	That was it for the tweets too.
10713032	10716214	And we've got to get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up.
10716254	10718094	I think we already did last minute stories.
10718615	10721416	So let's get everybody's last minute thoughts.
10722576	10726198	My final thought tonight is I'm excited to go home and eat.
10726298	10726878	Yay, food.
10726918	10727379	I love food.
10727839	10728779	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10729079	10731621	Making good headway on Call of Duty 4 modding.
10732721	10734642	And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10734742	10735783	My night is far from over.
10738601	10741862	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
10741882	10754366	We really appreciate your support, especially when poopy things happen to us like our internet goes out so we can't do a show one week randomly or our website suddenly goes down.
10754666	10756527	We really appreciate that you guys stand by with us.
10756927	10767030	Even though I know the podcasties will be a little bit behind, we still had a very full chat room tonight and I really appreciate that, all things considered, considering we don't have a website where you can go to chat.orangenloungeradio.com or any of that.
10767410	10788964	so really appreciate you guys if you like what you heard we're not begging for your money all we ask tell people about the show word of mouth help spread the word about the show tell a person who may not have heard of it about the show and help the OL Army grow and we can spread the word the term of Xbox Lube throughout the universe
10789884	10806837	that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio we'll be back next week hopefully with a website and everything to do it all over again with next week in gaming news and I'm sure even more games to be played this week including it sounds like Mario Kart 7 by this time next week right?
