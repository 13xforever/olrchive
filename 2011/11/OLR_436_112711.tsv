0	6000	All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.
6000	10000	Up next, Orange Lounge Radio.
10000	13000	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
13000	20000	Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	27000	Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.
27000	32000	Tonight, November 27th, 2011, a special connect for Windows is detailed.
32000	35000	One group of people want Skyrim to be banned.
35000	41000	And is Sony planning an answer to Smash Brothers?
41000	45000	Orange Lounge Radio.
45000	48000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
48000	52000	where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio.
52000	57000	We are live at All Games Radio, where we do tape live every Sunday night
57000	61000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
61000	65000	www.allgames.com if you want to tune in to listen.
65000	69000	Also, joining us, excuse me, my name is Rob Roberts.
69000	72000	I should introduce myself first, then I'll introduce the co-host.
72000	75000	Like, who's this guy? I just downloaded this show. Who's this guy?
75000	79000	I'm Rob Roberts, and joining me as they always do, week after week,
79000	83000	for the past nine and a half years, say hello to the one and only
83000	85000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
85000	86000	Hi.
86000	87000	How are you?
87000	88000	I'm almost full.
88000	89000	Yeah?
89000	95000	I made lamb leg with parsnips in the slow cooker.
95000	99000	And then I took the broth, so it's got all that good meat fat in it.
99000	101000	Food, food, food, food, food, food, food.
101000	103000	And cooked quinoa in it, so now my quinoa's creamy.
103000	106000	Now, I notice in your other hand, you have an old friend of the show
106000	108000	who's been gone for, like, several years.
108000	109000	He ran away to die.
109000	113000	Makes his triumphant return to the show tonight.
113000	114000	Are you gonna say hello?
114000	117000	Yeah, but this is gonna break your heart, or my heart, anyway.
117000	118000	All right, here we go.
121000	122000	Oh, he's working now.
122000	123000	Oh.
123000	124000	He was going...
126000	127000	When I pressed it earlier.
127000	130000	It's the O.L.R. Ferret, the official orange laundry...
130000	131000	Oh, God.
131000	135000	He's not doing healthy after all these years.
135000	137000	He might need to have an operation.
137000	139000	You might have to open up his butt and replace the battery.
139000	140000	Gosh.
140000	141000	Well...
141000	143000	Oh, but look at that face.
143000	146000	The orange laundry radio ferret is slowly dying, ladies and gentlemen.
146000	149000	Just like the quality of this program.
150000	151000	Say hello as well.
151000	152000	He's gonna model my quinoa.
152000	154000	I don't know why you're bothering to take a picture of it,
154000	156000	because we have no website right now, but hey.
156000	158000	The flicker still works.
158000	159000	That's true, the flicker still works.
159000	161000	Get it up there when it comes back.
161000	165000	Joining us as well, hopefully not about to soon die.
165000	167000	He'll be with us for a long, long time.
167000	169000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
169000	172000	Yeah, you can replace the batteries in those by cutting the stomach open.
172000	173000	We need an operation.
173000	174000	I did that one time.
174000	176000	Remember, we had like four ferrets at one time.
176000	177000	I do.
177000	178000	I don't know where they went.
178000	179000	You came into the show one time and you were like,
179000	180000	Hey, Jamie, here.
180000	182000	And you threw like five ferrets at her.
182000	185000	And I held them all the entire episode because they were my babies.
185000	190000	We mailed one to one of our friends in Colorado, Rai Chan.
190000	193000	I don't know if she still listens, but she's out there.
193000	197000	And I think we gave another one to a long time OLR listener.
197000	199000	Didn't one of them get stuck to a Katamari?
199000	202000	Yeah, we put one on the giant Katamari ball, one E3.
202000	203000	We did that.
203000	206000	So they kind of slowly went their separate ways.
206000	209000	And now we have the old school original one is still here.
209000	212000	So our little unofficial official mascot of Orange Laundry radio.
212000	214000	So yeah, a lot of things are broken.
214000	218000	Not only is my introduction broken tonight, but in the ferret is slowly dying.
218000	222000	But obviously we weren't here last week because of the last minute internet
222000	223000	failure.
223000	225000	It was not a planned absence for us.
225000	228000	But unfortunately, the internet was down at dark sacros all day long.
228000	229000	Right.
229000	231000	Like, and you were having problems before that.
231000	232000	Oh, yeah.
232000	235000	Every time it rains, Comcast goes for fuck's sake.
235000	237000	So but thankfully.
237000	240000	So around four o'clock that day, we just had to make a decision like,
240000	244000	OK, well, we can't even really tape a show without internet because we use
244000	249000	internet to get our stories and to do some of the other incidental background
249000	250000	music and stuff.
250000	251000	So we couldn't do a show period.
251000	253000	We said, and we'll just take the week off anyway.
253000	254000	It's right before Thanksgiving.
254000	255000	So whatever.
255000	257000	A lot of shows are going to be off.
257000	263000	We're back here tonight to news that we don't have a website right now.
263000	265000	I know when you go to Orange Laundry radio.com,
265000	267000	it says something about an account billing issue.
267000	269000	That's actually not the issue.
269000	272000	It's not something as obvious as Rob didn't pay the bill.
272000	274000	Is the man bringing us down?
274000	275000	It is.
275000	276000	It is.
276000	277000	It's SOPA.
277000	278000	It went into effect, everybody.
278000	281000	Unfortunately, because we play music during the show.
281000	282000	No, it's not.
282000	284000	It's the one percent.
284000	286000	It's the man.
286000	287000	No, here's the thing.
287000	291000	Our website space has been graciously donated for the past.
291000	293000	When did we move off of my personal domain?
293000	294000	It was about seven years ago.
294000	296000	So, I mean, it was a long, long time ago.
296000	298000	We were on live 365.
298000	299000	Let me put it that way.
299000	300000	It was a long time ago.
300000	301000	We had our website.
301000	304000	It's been graciously donated by one of our listeners and friends,
304000	309000	IRL and former DER Freak moderator when there was a DDR Freak, VX Jason XV.
309000	312000	And, you know, he's been able to get the web space for us.
312000	314000	And I think it's like a friend of a friend thing.
314000	318000	And unfortunately, when things break, because we don't pay for it,
318000	320000	that doesn't mean things get fixed right away.
320000	324000	So we have to understand that, you know, beggars can't be choosers.
324000	325000	So he is aware.
325000	326000	He's working on it.
326000	327000	Don't pester him about it.
327000	328000	He knows.
328000	331000	And I know he's working really hard to try and fix it one way or another,
331000	335000	even if that ends up meaning we have to kind of get web space somewhere else.
335000	340000	So keep an eye on our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R or our Facebook.
340000	343000	And we'll let you know what's going on with the website as we know.
343000	346000	Unfortunately, this does mean that it affects the podcast folks,
346000	348000	because without a website, we can't deliver the podcast.
348000	352000	So the only people here in the show right now are our live listeners.
352000	354000	And it probably won't make the feed tonight,
354000	357000	which is unfortunate because we've been on a really good track record
357000	359000	of getting the show up for the Monday morning crowd.
359000	361000	And sadly, it won't be there for them tonight.
361000	363000	But we'll get it up as soon as we possibly can.
363000	368000	So hopefully, you podcastees will be listening to this before too long.
368000	371000	So let's see.
371000	372000	Going to our chat room.
372000	373000	Our chat room is still there.
373000	377000	And usually, I say join us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,
377000	379000	but that's not going to work due to the website outage.
379000	381000	So tonight, you can do it one of two ways.
381000	386000	You go to Game Search, which is our network on – well, not our network,
386000	388000	but the network we use on IRC.
388000	392000	Gamesurge.net and any IRC clients, there's an IRC.
392000	395000	And you join Channel Orange Lounge.
395000	398000	Honestly, if that's too difficult, just go to chat.allgames.com
398000	401000	and they'll point you in the right direction.
401000	404000	And my apologies to the fine folks at All Games Chat,
404000	407000	but they'll understand, I hope.
407000	410000	So anyhow, before we get into our gaming weeks and all that,
410000	412000	I thought we could talk a little bit about this.
412000	414000	It's something I kind of wanted to talk about last week.
414000	416000	We didn't end up having a show.
416000	417000	Sorry.
417000	420000	It's not your fault. Just things happen.
420000	422000	We'll talk a little bit about charity.
422000	424000	Because, you know, tis the season.
424000	426000	It's the holidays and stuff.
426000	429000	And this is the season where charity donations
429000	431000	and things like that really kick into high gear.
431000	433000	You know, as people are out spending like mad,
433000	436000	killing each other over $2 waffle irons and so forth.
436000	438000	You know, there's –
438000	439000	Waffle irons for $2?
439000	441000	Waffle irons for $2, you say?
441000	444000	Yes, just try not to get clobbered with one.
444000	448000	You see the YouTube of all them people fighting over $2 waffle irons?
448000	450000	It's quite a sight to be held.
450000	452000	That's stupid. You want to hear something else that's stupid?
452000	457000	We got back after having Thanksgiving dinner with our family,
457000	460000	and we came home and we're like,
460000	462000	crap, there's like nothing to do.
462000	463000	Let's watch TV.
463000	468000	Hey, look. Lady Gaga's having a Thanksgiving special.
468000	470000	I didn't see it, believe it or not.
470000	472000	She made waffles with –
472000	475000	or I wouldn't say she made waffles.
475000	482000	A chef that makes food for her was making waffles with salami in them.
482000	486000	That's weird, but I'd try it.
486000	489000	Were you tempted by Gaga's delicious waffles?
489000	491000	I think you were.
491000	493000	Waffles are good, but it was weird.
493000	496000	Waffle Gaga.
496000	498000	Lady Waf Waf.
498000	500000	That sounds kind of dirty.
500000	501000	It does a little bit.
501000	503000	So anyhow, charity. Hello.
503000	505000	Going back to charity.
505000	509000	I know Child's Play is obviously one of the biggest gamer charities,
509000	512000	and they've kicked off their official donation season,
512000	513000	you know, during the holidays.
513000	516000	There's been a lot of stuff going on, like Desert Bus.
516000	519000	Gosh, this has been, what, the fifth year I think that's been going on.
519000	521000	If you don't know what Desert Bus is,
521000	523000	I don't think you've been following a lot of the gaming internet stuff,
523000	525000	but we'll explain it anyway.
525000	527000	There's this game that came out on –
527000	529000	God, what system was Desert Bus on?
529000	531000	Was that a 3DO game?
531000	533000	It was on some obscure-ish system, wasn't it?
533000	535000	That was on the Sega CD.
535000	538000	That was part of the – wasn't that part of the Penn and Teller game?
538000	539000	Yeah.
539000	540000	That was on the Sega CD.
540000	541000	Was it the Sega CD?
541000	544000	It was Penn and Teller's up in – or Smoke and Mirrors.
544000	546000	I knew it was one of those CD systems I didn't have.
546000	549000	And, like, you drive a bus for, like, the whole thing.
549000	553000	And the deal is you drive a bus from L.A. to Vegas,
553000	557000	but don't expect the graphics to look like, you know,
557000	559000	burnout or something.
559000	561000	Wasn't the whole thing is that they hate video games or something,
561000	562000	so they made a video game or –
562000	563000	Yeah.
563000	564000	Yeah.
564000	565000	So –
565000	568000	Or something about the realism or something.
568000	572000	Yeah, and you really drive the actual distance.
572000	573000	It's not abbreviated.
573000	576000	And you're not allowed to drive above a certain mileage
576000	577000	because you're driving a bus.
577000	580000	So to drive from one to the other takes, like, four hours.
580000	584000	And all you do – and you can't just, like, rubber-band the button down
584000	587000	or anything because every so often you have to slightly adjust your steering
587000	589000	or the bus will go off track.
589000	591000	Yeah, because the alignment's not correct.
591000	592000	Exactly.
592000	595000	So when you make it all the way, you score one point.
595000	598000	It takes, like, four hours to do so.
598000	602000	So these crazy guys actually put together this whole thing
602000	608000	where they drive back and forth for – I think they went for six days this year.
608000	609000	They played desert.
609000	612000	I don't think it was the same guy, but this group did it for, like,
612000	615000	six days straight and they raised a shit-ton of money for Child's Play,
615000	616000	which is great.
616000	618000	Well over $300,000.
618000	624000	Something we've talked about a lot on this show is something a little more local to us that goes on,
624000	628000	and that's UmLoud, which is, again, happening this year, December 8th.
628000	631000	On – it's a Thursday this year.
631000	634000	And Dark Soccer and myself, I believe we're both going to be there this year.
634000	635000	We're going.
635000	637000	So we hope to see you guys there.
637000	639000	That's at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco.
639000	643000	There's going to be an online component this year.
643000	645000	I guess more information on that is coming soon.
645000	649000	So even if you don't live in the San Francisco area, there is going to be ways you can participate,
649000	651000	but the details on that are forthcoming.
651000	655000	And the other thing I'd mention, too, in case you want to experience Desert Bus,
655000	658000	it is now on iOS and Android marketplaces.
658000	660000	Yes. Yes, it is. It is.
660000	662000	And apparently there's a pop-up version.
662000	670000	Which is nice because they actually donate all the proceeds for the iOS 1 to the Child's Play charity.
670000	676000	And I want to say, wasn't that the one where Penn Jillette actually ended up donating money?
676000	678000	I don't think it was this year. I think it was last year or something.
678000	681000	He donated quite a bit of money. Like, he actually knew about it.
681000	685000	So it's kind of neat.
685000	687000	So anyhow, lots of charity stuff going on.
687000	694000	So, you know, think about some of that money you saved on all those Black Friday sales or Steam sales or so forth.
694000	696000	Think about giving it to a good cause.
696000	702000	And even if that cause is not Child's Play for you, maybe it's, I don't know, St. Jude's Hospital,
702000	707000	March for Babies, American Red Cross, whatever the charity is.
707000	713000	Although about the American Red Cross, though, keep your money out of those guys
713000	717000	ringing the bells in front of retail stores.
717000	718000	The Salvation Army?
718000	721000	Yeah, I thought that was Red Cross, but Salvation Army.
721000	727000	Don't give them any money because, especially now, I guess they're taking credit cards as well.
727000	732000	I mean, do I really want to slide a credit card through a skimmer that they may have
732000	737000	so that I can hopefully get the money going to them and not some crook?
737000	740000	Just do it through online if you're going to do that.
740000	743000	Do you have views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio? Not necessarily?
743000	745000	Alright, anyway.
745000	748000	Well, actually, they have caught a number of scammers.
748000	752000	Just be careful. Always be careful.
752000	753000	Get a receipt.
753000	755000	Do it through the websites.
755000	760000	Or just do Desert Bus or UMLoud because those are two ones we know, or Child's Play themselves,
760000	764000	and those are several different ones we know are reputable and all that.
764000	770000	Anyhow, let's move on. Let's talk about video games and how was your gaming week,
770000	772000	the video games you've been playing this week.
772000	775000	I don't know about you guys, but I've played a ton, so let's go around the table.
775000	777000	We'll start with Dark Soccer. Ladies first.
777000	782000	Well, I actually played some stuff while my internet was sort of working.
782000	785000	I actually played a lot of Droplets, Rob.
785000	787000	That's that random-ass puzzle game that's on Steam, huh?
787000	790000	Yeah, it's actually pretty funny. Funny. Fun, I should say.
790000	795000	I don't want to say it's like Pipe Dream, but it does involve pipes and water going through,
795000	797000	but it's all like they're falling.
797000	798000	But you run out of drops.
798000	799000	Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
799000	802000	And you have to collect them in your reservoir and get more,
802000	806000	and you can actually get little pockets that will open up that you can get more drops.
806000	811000	And so you get a score as long as you have drops to play with.
811000	815000	Actually, I have to look at my Steam list because I have to look at what I was like.
815000	822000	I actually played a bunch of Portal 2 as well, just, you know, again, while my internet was not working.
822000	824000	Let me throw this out there while you're pulling up the list,
824000	826000	because actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrady.com
826000	829000	is jumping in on the charity discussion with another suggestion,
829000	832000	and that is do the Humble Indie Bundle.
832000	835000	And that's a very good point, because the Humble Indie Bundle,
835000	839000	that money you can choose if you want the money to go all to the developers
839000	843000	or you want to go all to Child's Play or EFF.
843000	846000	You can, you know, kind of choose how the money is distributed.
846000	848000	I don't think they have a bundle going on right now.
848000	852000	There's a different type of bundle we're going to talk about a little later in the show,
852000	855000	but as far as the gaming bundle, there's nothing right now,
855000	857000	but there probably will be one soon enough.
857000	859000	Those have been doing very well, so we'll see.
859000	863000	I was also playing some Doom 2.
863000	868000	And, where else was I? Oh yeah, I was playing Peggle Extreme.
868000	871000	I tried to play Magica, but while my internet was down, it was like,
871000	873000	no, you can't play this game.
873000	878000	And then a few people actually all gave me the same game.
878000	881000	It gave me Fallout New Vegas.
881000	883000	Gee, tough problem.
883000	885000	Wait, wait, several people bought you Fallout New Vegas?
885000	887000	I know it was on sale earlier this week.
887000	888000	I guess so. I mean, maybe it was like...
888000	889000	Was it on your wish list or something?
889000	891000	I think it might have been.
891000	892000	Ah, there you go.
892000	896000	I mean, I can look, but yeah, Fallout New Vegas is actually really sweet.
896000	903000	I put up a couple of screenies from, I can pull up my Steam account
903000	906000	and show people a few screenies, but I mean,
906000	908000	I had never really had much of an interest in playing it,
908000	913000	but when I started playing it, it really,
913000	917000	I had friends that played the RPG and kind of seeing their books
917000	921000	and seeing how the game set up, it actually kind of seemed like the same,
921000	925000	you know, had the same feel, except then you're, you know,
925000	927000	first person or you can play third person.
927000	929000	You can play behind the shoulder.
929000	932000	So I didn't actually get as bad motion sick as I might have.
932000	938000	However, I am incredibly lost after killing a few geckos in the face,
938000	941000	which is funny because they die ugly and I think it's awesome,
941000	945000	and I'm playing some chick with red hair.
945000	946000	Some chick with red hair.
946000	947000	Some chick with red hair.
947000	950000	I was corrected in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
950000	952000	There is a Humble Bundle going on right now. I'm so sorry.
952000	954000	I was not aware. This is news to me.
954000	956000	This is one I might have to purchase.
956000	958000	There is a Humble Bundle going on right now.
958000	960000	And guess what? Dark Soccer, this may interest you
960000	963000	because it is the Humble Introversion Bundle.
963000	965000	And if you don't know what game they did,
965000	967000	they're the folks behind Darwinia.
967000	971000	So Darwinia is in this bundle as well as Uplink, Defcon,
971000	973000	Multiwinia is all in this.
973000	978000	And if you pay more than the average, which right now is $3.75,
978000	979000	gosh, that's so low.
979000	983000	I would hope you'd pay at least like $10 or $20 for this.
983000	986000	Aquaria and Crayon Physics Deluxe get thrown in as well.
986000	989000	So there is a bundle going on right now. My apologies.
989000	993000	I don't know. How much longer is that going for?
993000	995000	Is that like just tonight or is that going into next week?
995000	998000	Let's see. Eight days left. Oh shit.
998000	999000	So you've got some time there.
999000	1000000	You got at least another week.
1000000	1003000	Usually if you wait to the end, there's more stuff tacked on.
1003000	1004000	Looks like they've already done it.
1004000	1006000	Yeah. All right. Well, go for it.
1006000	1010000	If you buy early, you still get the extra stuff that they end up adding.
1010000	1012000	And what I really like about the way Humble Bundle does it
1012000	1014000	is that you get steam codes for everything.
1014000	1016000	So like I bought it and then I just loaded it all into steam
1016000	1019000	the last time I bought one, which was the bundle that had VVVVV in it.
1019000	1022000	So yeah, pretty cool.
1022000	1027000	Oh yeah, I've actually played more than, oh yeah, I did play wow for the record.
1027000	1032000	I'm working on my rep with the Sha'tari Skyguard.
1032000	1033000	Good times.
1033000	1037000	So I can fly around on a fat short manta ray.
1037000	1040000	There's a birthday party going on a while right now.
1040000	1042000	Oh yeah, that thing.
1042000	1046000	It messes up my look, Rob.
1046000	1048000	And just a little quick side note.
1048000	1049000	What?
1049000	1052000	Whoever that freaking Taran was that was killing all of my birds?
1052000	1055000	DIAF. The end.
1055000	1057000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1057000	1061000	And this is going to be continuing on
1061000	1064000	because we're not playing Grand Theft Auto anymore.
1064000	1066000	We're playing Call of Duty now.
1066000	1068000	This is weird to me.
1068000	1071000	This is modern warfare. I'm still kicking ass though.
1071000	1073000	And you know what?
1073000	1075000	You've turned into a bro.
1075000	1080000	It's been, what, less than a week and I'm already trying to mod the game.
1080000	1086000	So I'm working on a mod for...
1086000	1088000	Dan's yelling from the other room.
1088000	1090000	Make it not suck.
1090000	1094000	I have a tangent about bros I want to talk about in a minute.
1094000	1097000	But yeah, it's been pretty fun.
1097000	1100000	We're playing hardcore mode because they don't like the fact that
1100000	1105000	I could kill faster if I have a map and I can kind of see where people are firing from.
1105000	1107000	I'm still killing pretty fast anyways.
1107000	1110000	But we're just kind of playing around right now.
1110000	1112000	System Link. And it's been fun.
1112000	1115000	It's been great because we don't have any lag.
1115000	1119000	And we don't have the problem with disconnects because our internet's terrible at work.
1119000	1122000	We'd get disconnected from games all the time in Grand Theft Auto.
1122000	1124000	And funny enough now we see,
1124000	1128000	Oh, disconnect from live. Oh, that doesn't matter because we're not playing on live.
1128000	1130000	So we have that.
1130000	1134000	But yeah, I am working on something actually kind of unique for it.
1134000	1140000	Just like some special balance mod thing where each class would have different weapons
1140000	1147000	and a special ability kind of like a button or something that you would have a one minute ability
1147000	1151000	that would be like god mode or invisibility or something like that.
1151000	1154000	And then with a five minute cooldown for each thing.
1154000	1159000	So it's really intricate but you can actually program quite a bit in Call of Duty which is kind of cool.
1159000	1161000	So I'm going to mess around with that.
1161000	1165000	Actually hopefully I'm going to mess around with Grand Theft Auto mods at some point
1165000	1167000	because I've just been really distracted by everything.
1167000	1170000	I've played Saints Row. I've pretty much beat Saints Row.
1170000	1173000	Actually I have beat Saints Row. Almost 100%.
1173000	1179000	All the side missions and stuff were done except for the car thefts.
1179000	1183000	And those are really annoying because it's really glitched.
1183000	1188000	The one I was on now, apparently every time you go into the zone to steal the car,
1188000	1193000	it just for some reason explodes or just is gone.
1193000	1198000	And I don't understand why because it's just something with the game. It's broken.
1198000	1200000	So I can't really do that.
1200000	1204000	But there's I guess ways around it and I'll eventually go back to it.
1204000	1206000	But for the most part I have everything done.
1206000	1213000	I just have to play through the game again to finish some missions in a different way.
1213000	1216000	Like Act 1, finish that in a different way.
1216000	1221000	And then also the third act I have to finish.
1221000	1224000	Or Murder Brawl, I have to do that a different way.
1224000	1228000	Did the Tron parody stuff in Saints Row end up being good or was it just kind of...
1228000	1230000	Yeah, that's pretty much what you saw in the video.
1230000	1232000	They had some interesting stuff.
1232000	1235000	There's even a little bit of Zork in there.
1235000	1237000	Awesome. Do you get eaten by a Gru?
1237000	1245000	No, there's actually a text adventure part that you have to do a little bit of stuff there.
1245000	1247000	But it's pretty awesome.
1247000	1251000	Do you end up in front of a house and there is a white mailbox here?
1251000	1255000	Something like that. It's a parody of it.
1255000	1258000	You have to go kill a unicorn is what it is.
1258000	1260000	Damn you unicorns!
1260000	1266000	So there's something with that. But what's kind of cool is the perks you get from beating that portion of the game.
1266000	1269000	You actually get one of the combat tanks.
1269000	1271000	You get to drive around the city and fire it.
1271000	1273000	And it has all the sound effects from combat.
1273000	1276000	Which is great. It's a big blocky tank.
1276000	1280000	And then they also have these bikes you can get that are like...
1280000	1284000	You get a bike and a car that look like Tron stuff.
1284000	1285000	So that's pretty awesome.
1285000	1292000	But yeah, it's pretty sweet. And then after you beat the game, obviously you can mess around and just do whatever.
1292000	1295000	But now I have to get all the achievements for it.
1295000	1297000	Because I'm almost done. I have almost everything.
1297000	1299000	So I have to play through as a woman now.
1299000	1302000	So I'll be making a Dark Sakura character since you already have a character.
1302000	1304000	And I have a character.
1304000	1310000	Apparently Travis Donovan at Undersedation Live, our buddies that are on Saturday night at All Games Radio.
1310000	1316000	Travis Donovan made a Rob Roberts character in Saints Row who wears bunny slippers and a Hello Kitty backpack.
1316000	1320000	Although it's not really Hello Kitty but it's their answer to that.
1320000	1323000	So you can do all that stuff.
1323000	1328000	He has to play through the game as a girl so he's gonna make the Dark Sakura character.
1328000	1329000	I'm afraid.
1329000	1332000	She'll be wearing all black and kill things with fire.
1332000	1333000	Okay.
1333000	1335000	I kill things with fire.
1335000	1337000	I approve of the killing with fire.
1337000	1342000	But what's great about it is you can actually go on the website.
1342000	1345000	She should have a giant menorah she whaps people with.
1345000	1348000	I would not do that to my menorah.
1348000	1351000	They don't have that.
1351000	1359000	What's kind of cool though is you can go on the website and you can actually tag different characters you want to download to your game.
1359000	1365000	So anybody that listens to the show can go find Travis Donovan's character or you can link to it or whatever.
1365000	1369000	And they go tag it and then download it into their game and play as you in their game.
1369000	1370000	Which is awesome.
1370000	1372000	And I forgot to bring you a copy of the game today.
1372000	1373000	That's alright.
1373000	1374000	I had one.
1374000	1377000	I've got so much I'm trying to play right now anyway I can use another one.
1377000	1379000	But you really should play Saints Row the Third.
1379000	1383000	I really do want to play Saints Row the Third especially knowing that somebody else made my damn character.
1383000	1384000	It is awesome.
1384000	1386000	But it actually turned out really good.
1386000	1389000	I saw the pictures and I'm like that's cute.
1389000	1390000	It's such a great game.
1390000	1398000	It's seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it and I played it for almost, no I did play it for over 30 hours because I got that achievement.
1398000	1401000	30 and 30 so, 3 and 30 I guess.
1401000	1405000	So I did play over 30 hours of the game.
1405000	1412000	And so yeah aside from that I've been playing Skyrim which is great.
1412000	1418000	I almost gave it up pretty quick because the first time I played the game something glitched out.
1418000	1423000	And I went to the first town I'm supposed to go to and everyone started attacking me.
1423000	1424000	Trying to kill me.
1424000	1426000	I'm like, okay what the fuck.
1426000	1430000	I can't do anything because you guys keep trying to attack me.
1430000	1432000	Except for the one character I was supposed to talk to.
1432000	1434000	He was fine but everyone's like trying to kill me.
1434000	1435000	I'm like, okay.
1435000	1438000	I don't understand why they did the piss everybody off.
1438000	1440000	So the hell with this.
1440000	1445000	So I finally tried it again and I'm really enjoying it because now it's actually working correctly.
1445000	1447000	You might have accidentally murdered somebody.
1447000	1448000	Maybe.
1448000	1451000	Maybe I hit somebody with a sword.
1451000	1454000	Maybe I decapitated somebody and forgot.
1454000	1456000	Oops.
1456000	1459000	Well I had something earlier that I ran into.
1459000	1464000	I decided to go exploring off and then I see this giant attacking these two people.
1464000	1466000	So I'm going to go help them.
1466000	1468000	So I started shooting fire at the giant.
1468000	1470000	So people started coming and attacking me.
1470000	1473000	Because I guess some of the splash damage started hitting them.
1473000	1475000	I'm like, you fucking idiots.
1475000	1477000	So what? You got injured a little bit.
1477000	1479000	I killed the giant for you.
1479000	1482000	For such an enormously, enormous game.
1482000	1485000	A game as vast as Skyrim.
1485000	1488000	It does really have its derpy moments.
1488000	1494000	There's some real things in Skyrim that just don't make sense.
1494000	1497000	It should be like if you do a little bit of damage to somebody.
1497000	1499000	They're like, hey, don't do that or something.
1499000	1502000	And then if you continually do that, then they should start attacking you.
1502000	1508000	But not just like, oh, I accidentally dealt a little bit of damage to you.
1508000	1512000	Or like, oh, you ran in front of my arrow or something like that.
1512000	1514000	And unfortunately you got stuck with an arrow.
1514000	1520000	They should have a little bit of like, you know, kind of, hey, stop that.
1520000	1523000	And then start attacking you if you keep attacking them.
1523000	1528000	I think that would be a little bit better than, oh, I accidentally hit you with a fireball.
1528000	1531000	Because I was aiming at the troll that's right next to you or something like that.
1531000	1533000	Anyways.
1533000	1536000	I like some of the lolsy stuff people have done with Skyrim online.
1536000	1538000	Like the house full of cabbage.
1538000	1540000	Have you seen that stuff?
1540000	1544000	I had to fight, once again, exploring.
1544000	1550000	Because I'm trying to get enough money to buy these boots that allow me to pick up more things.
1550000	1555000	Which is ironic because I got the money, the amount of money that was in the game to do that.
1555000	1558000	And all of a sudden I go back down to buy them.
1558000	1559000	Oh, and now they're more expensive.
1559000	1562000	I'm like, fuck you, I'm not buying those anymore.
1562000	1563000	But I have a lot of money now.
1563000	1567000	So I've been just exploring in places probably that I'm not supposed to be going yet.
1567000	1571000	And one of the places I found, all of a sudden I got attacked by three wisps.
1571000	1576000	And I was like, oh, this sucks because I'm only like level, I think I'm like level eight.
1576000	1580000	Or six at the time, I think, when I had attacked them.
1580000	1583000	So I was like, ah shit, these things look magical.
1583000	1584000	That's not good.
1584000	1586000	So I killed them.
1586000	1592000	And then it was the wisp mother that was there started shooting like some ice thing at me.
1592000	1595000	And so I decided to go try to kill her.
1595000	1601000	And that took about 15 to 20 minutes to actually take her down because I'm such a low level character.
1601000	1605000	Yeah, but they level with you so it would have taken 15 to 20 minutes anyway.
1605000	1606000	Really?
1606000	1610000	You do get a little bit of edge because of the talents and so forth that you get.
1610000	1615000	But unfortunately the enemies, it's not like a Final Fantasy where if you just grind, grind, grind, you'll be able to overpower everything.
1615000	1618000	It doesn't work like that.
1618000	1620000	But anyways, so yeah.
1620000	1624000	Honestly, in any Elder Scrolls game you should just do the main story first.
1624000	1629000	So that way you can just do it when it's easy and then go back and do open world lulzy fun.
1629000	1631000	Maybe we should do that then.
1631000	1633000	That's the way to approach an Elder Scrolls game, I really think.
1633000	1636000	So yeah, it took me about 15 minutes.
1636000	1639000	But it's funny because, you know, you were saying the house full of cabbages and stuff.
1639000	1641000	And the game's not exactly realistic.
1641000	1650000	At one point, because I had a bunch of stuff from crafting things, either making food or making alchemy and stuff like that.
1650000	1656000	So I got to the point where I had exhausted my potions that I had with me and I'm like, crap, I need more health.
1656000	1663000	So I ate 13 pounds of food at one point to level up.
1663000	1666000	Your skill in pooping has increased to 21.
1666000	1668000	It's just ridiculous.
1668000	1672000	It's like, okay, here's this two pound cheese wheel.
1672000	1676000	This will give you two health.
1676000	1679000	I'm going to eat four of those.
1679000	1688000	I can imagine this guy, like, high behind a rock, just shoving his mouth full of cabbage and carrots and raw rabbit.
1688000	1693000	Just all sorts of ridiculous stuff that you happen to be carrying with you.
1693000	1696000	And I also found another way. It was kind of fun.
1696000	1701000	I was really sad because remember how they had the thing where, oh, you can steal from people by putting pots over people's heads?
1701000	1703000	I thought that was only on PC.
1703000	1707000	Until I figured out you have to hold A and then you can move shit around.
1707000	1709000	I was like, oh, thank God.
1709000	1712000	It doesn't work, though. I haven't gotten it to work at all.
1712000	1713000	Maybe there's a trick to it. I've never tried it.
1713000	1714000	Which is too bad.
1714000	1722000	But it allowed me to, you know, because one of the things I kind of do is I pick up everything that is not attached.
1722000	1727000	Which is great because you do missions for people and stuff and all of a sudden they become friendly with you.
1727000	1729000	And they'll just let you take everything.
1729000	1734000	Like, I did a mission for the guy at the trading post or whatever.
1734000	1740000	And after that, everything in that house allowed me to take it almost, except for expensive armor and stuff.
1740000	1745000	Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.ownerswannatrader.com disagrees with me on what I'm saying about the level scaling.
1745000	1748000	Saying the enemies don't really level with you anymore in Skyrim, Rob.
1748000	1753000	They changed it due to people not liking it in Oblivion. It's more like Fallout now, really.
1753000	1758000	I could have sworn somebody was telling me that they were playing the game twice and saw the difference.
1758000	1762000	But maybe it's not as much of a weight as it was before.
1762000	1764000	Who knows?
1764000	1769000	But I like being able to overpower everything, personally.
1769000	1771000	I hope that's true.
1771000	1775000	I haven't played enough Skyrim. I really haven't because I've been distracted by so many other games.
1775000	1779000	I probably will not give Skyrim proper attention until Christmas time.
1779000	1782000	Skyrim's hilarious, because at one point I was like,
1782000	1785000	Oh, hey, wait a second. I can swim in the river.
1785000	1788000	I'm diving underwater, and I'm catching salmon.
1788000	1791000	For no apparent reason, other than I can.
1791000	1797000	That's the whole thing about Skyrim. I don't know why I'm doing this. I can.
1797000	1799000	Or Skyrim with the physics.
1799000	1803000	Hey, you can go along this mountain trail, or you can just walk straight up the mountain.
1803000	1806000	You'll just hit jump a lot, and you'll eventually climb the mountain.
1806000	1808000	That's what I do.
1808000	1812000	But yeah, I found out that if you're carrying too much, obviously it slows you down.
1812000	1817000	So what you can do is grab one more object by holding A, and it'll just hover out in front of you,
1817000	1819000	and then you just run back to town.
1819000	1823000	Of course, if you get to any doorway, you'll pick it up, take it in your inventory, walk through the door,
1823000	1827000	drop it, and pick it up again using the hold A thing, and just keep on running.
1827000	1829000	It was great. I was able to take one.
1829000	1831000	I brought you a pan!
1831000	1833000	I was able to take one more battle axe.
1833000	1835000	How stupid must that look?
1837000	1840000	Alright, Bobby has joined chat to try and clarify.
1840000	1843000	Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us live at All Games Radio,
1843000	1847000	to try and clarify, bring a little clarity to the Rim of Sky.
1847000	1849000	Sky says, here's how it works.
1849000	1851000	Or Blackwolf says, Sky, here's how it works.
1851000	1855000	When you first enter a dungeon area, it generates the enemies to your level.
1855000	1858000	If you leave that dungeon, go level up, and go back in.
1858000	1863000	They will be the same level they used to be, so you can overpower them, but not on the first entry.
1863000	1865000	Now, that makes a lot of sense.
1865000	1867000	So, here's what you need to do.
1867000	1869000	You need to find all the dungeons at level one.
1869000	1872000	Like I'm saying, go do the story mode right away.
1872000	1874000	And then that way, you know...
1874000	1877000	I'm going to, but I get distracted so much.
1877000	1879000	I know. I hear you.
1879000	1883000	Seriously, I have taken everything in that town, the first town, the Riverwood, whatever,
1883000	1886000	and I've taken everything that has not been bolted down.
1886000	1889000	It's great. There's so many glitches in the game.
1889000	1892000	Did you fill a house with cabbage?
1892000	1895000	I don't have a house to fill with cabbage yet, but I have a lot of cabbage.
1895000	1896000	Well, damn it, now you have a mission.
1896000	1899000	And I've eaten a lot of cabbage, too, so that's not good.
1899000	1902000	Anything else about your gaming week?
1902000	1904000	We could talk about Skyrim all night.
1904000	1908000	Seriously. Like, for example, one of the tricks you can level up any skill
1908000	1912000	by those people that will actually tell you, like, the first town you go to,
1912000	1915000	there's an elf there that will help you improve your archery.
1915000	1919000	Well, if you invite him into, you can invite him to join you,
1919000	1922000	and he'll come and help you, so you go and you pay for that,
1922000	1925000	and then you go, I need to trade with you, and you take your money back,
1925000	1927000	and then you pay him again and take your money back.
1927000	1931000	In fact, the other thing is, you can take his house key for no reason,
1931000	1936000	or just take all of his inventory, and then you go to his house and steal everything.
1936000	1941000	And then go to the middle of the forest and say, okay, wait here.
1941000	1943000	Pretty much.
1943000	1946000	I'm always, like, I'm paranoid that my stupid NPC that always follows me,
1946000	1948000	I have this chick named Lydia that follows me everywhere,
1948000	1950000	and I'm always paranoid she's gonna die.
1950000	1954000	Like, I'm like, because this game, like, if a fucking wolf bites her head off,
1954000	1956000	she's not coming back.
1956000	1959000	Like, she won't just flash and then respawn.
1959000	1961000	But here's the thing, though. Some of these NPCs don't die.
1961000	1963000	Because one of the things I did before I came over here, I was like,
1963000	1966000	hey, you know what, let me see how, if I could just kill everybody in this town.
1966000	1969000	So I saved it before I did that, and I tried to kill everybody.
1969000	1974000	I killed everybody except for the goddamn woman that works in the inn.
1974000	1978000	You can kill her. First, she's a really tough son of a bitch.
1978000	1980000	And then, on top of that...
1980000	1981000	You mean daughter of a bitch?
1981000	1982000	Whatever.
1982000	1983000	How about bitch?
1983000	1985000	Yeah, she's a really tough bitch.
1985000	1989000	And then on top of that, you kill her, and she doesn't really die.
1989000	1992000	She just comes back to life again and starts fucking trying to kill you again.
1992000	1994000	She might be integral to the story or something.
1994000	1998000	Like, you probably can't kill people that, like, keep you from completing the actual story.
1998000	2001000	Eh, I don't care. I know. I know you don't care.
2001000	2005000	Just finish the story, then go do whatever you want. Whatever you want.
2005000	2008000	Burn a whole village down for all I care, then wait for the DLC.
2008000	2011000	Alright. Anything else for your gaming week?
2011000	2015000	Uh... a little bit of Zuma. That's it.
2015000	2018000	Let me move on. I got some games I want to talk about.
2018000	2020000	I've played a lot. I can only talk about some of the games I've played this week,
2020000	2024000	because I've played a lot in the past couple weeks since we last had a show.
2024000	2027000	So let me start with the one I've probably played the least of,
2027000	2030000	which is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2030000	2032000	I bought this more for Alan because he wanted it.
2032000	2035000	And keep in mind, we didn't own Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2035000	2039000	It's like we knew that they were going to release a new version just nine months later.
2039000	2041000	So we ordered that over Amazon.
2041000	2042000	They always do.
2042000	2045000	I know. I know that for next time now.
2045000	2048000	So I'm going to be wary about buying Capcom games when they first come out.
2048000	2053000	Like, I'm going to have to be convinced they're not going to release an Uber edition six months later.
2053000	2057000	But anyway, so it's really my first taste of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at all.
2057000	2063000	The controls are weird because I guess they took more of a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom direction with them.
2063000	2065000	Yeah, exactly.
2065000	2066000	Not a fan.
2066000	2069000	Much easier if you've got the arcade controller.
2069000	2071000	Yeah, I could see that. I could see that.
2071000	2076000	So I'm not a fan because I like my games like Street Fighter, but that's okay.
2076000	2078000	The art style is really good.
2078000	2082000	It's so fun to play on an HDTV with awesome sound.
2082000	2084000	The graphics and everything look great.
2084000	2086000	Lots of great characters.
2086000	2090000	Some weird choices, especially on the Capcom side, but okay.
2090000	2091000	Rocket Raccoon.
2091000	2094000	No, I said it on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.
2094000	2095000	That's Marvel.
2095000	2096000	Rocket Raccoon is Marvel.
2096000	2097000	I know.
2097000	2100000	I said weird choices on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.
2100000	2101000	Right, but that's a weird one.
2101000	2102000	Yeah, it is weird.
2102000	2103000	I hear you.
2103000	2104000	That's what I was saying.
2104000	2105000	I thought you liked Rocket Raccoon.
2105000	2106000	I do like Rocket Raccoon.
2106000	2108000	It's just sort of out of the blue.
2108000	2110000	So there are some weird choices in there.
2110000	2113000	But, you know, it can't all be totally mainstream.
2113000	2116000	That's kind of part of the fun of it.
2116000	2118000	So yeah, I've just done some light skirmishes in that.
2118000	2119000	Very difficult game, too.
2119000	2123000	The difficulties, even on very easy, it can be a pain in the ass.
2123000	2126000	Alan was screaming at the TV trying to beat Galacticus, or at least, you know, kinda.
2126000	2129000	He doesn't really scream at the TV, but just in his irritated way.
2129000	2130000	Flick.
2130000	2131000	Yeah, I know, right?
2131000	2135000	So yeah, that was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2135000	2141000	I bought a game on Steam that was dirt cheap last week, not during this whole Autumn sale they've been doing.
2141000	2148000	But last week, they had a game called Magica on sale for like $2.50, and you could even download the demo.
2148000	2153000	Or no, you downloaded the full game, and you could just play the full game for free through Sunday.
2153000	2156000	Like, this is the kind of stuff Steam can let you do.
2156000	2158000	So I ended up buying the Uber edition for like 9 bucks.
2158000	2160000	It comes with all the expansions.
2160000	2161000	I liked Magica. It was cool.
2161000	2166000	It's kinda like it was a dungeon crawler slash puzzler slash...
2166000	2171000	The big thing about Magica is that you mix and match these different spell types.
2171000	2178000	Like you have fire, ice, earth, lightning, arcane, life.
2178000	2185000	And you can mix the different types to create these, you know, either energy bolts or like...
2185000	2192000	One thing you could do, you mix shield with life, and you get like life grenades that you put in the ground.
2192000	2194000	And when you step on them, they bloom health.
2194000	2198000	Or you could mix shield with fire, and you get like actual grenades.
2198000	2201000	So it's interesting kind of learning about the combinations.
2201000	2205000	So exploration definitely plays heavy into this.
2205000	2211000	This is the game as well, and I know we talked about this on the show a while back, but it had some very strange expansions.
2211000	2216000	Like the first expansion for Magica is Magica Vietnam.
2216000	2219000	And it's the little magic characters in Vietnam.
2219000	2224000	And the joke is because all the shooter games end up having a Vietnam expansion.
2224000	2226000	So Magica got a Vietnam expansion.
2226000	2228000	There's a lot of very tongue-in-cheekness.
2228000	2231000	The game is very tongue-in-cheek. It's sharp-witted.
2231000	2237000	I think it was right after they announced the Battlefield Bad Company 2, like, Vietnam expansion.
2237000	2243000	So, yeah. And then they did some other expansions after that.
2243000	2248000	So, yeah. I enjoyed Magica, and it was fun to play.
2248000	2253000	You can play it online, too. Like, Alan and I were doing co-op in the same room over Steam online.
2253000	2257000	It was pretty fun. So you can play like I think up to four or six people at once.
2257000	2261000	And there's all these other modes I haven't even touched yet, because, again, other games have distracted me.
2261000	2265000	But there's like, you know, challenge modes, and PvP I guess is a big element.
2265000	2269000	Because I got the Uber edition, I got all these different Magica types.
2269000	2273000	And what's funny is that one of them is like a Tron dude.
2273000	2277000	They all wear the little hooded robe things. They look like little monks.
2277000	2282000	But this particular monk has the energy lines and carries an energy disc, right?
2282000	2285000	And I played that when I was playing online with Alan. He couldn't heal me.
2285000	2289000	And we couldn't figure it out. Like, why the hell can't you heal me? I can heal you, but you can't heal me.
2289000	2293000	Well, it's because since I was playing as Tron dude, you don't heal me with life.
2293000	2298000	You heal me with lightning. So whenever he would shoot a lightning bolt at me, I would heal.
2298000	2304000	So just funny little quirks like that were in the game and kind of lead to the puzzle elements of Magica.
2304000	2309000	So, yeah, let's see. Other games I've been playing this week.
2309000	2313000	Okay, here's a game I've been playing a lot of. A lot of this game.
2313000	2316000	And I really, I don't know why. When I tell you what game it is, you're going to be like,
2316000	2320000	What? Out of everything out right now, you're playing that?
2320000	2325000	So we went to Evil G one day because we had a gift card we had to spend.
2325000	2331000	So we found a game that was the perfect amount of money and it was White Knight Chronicles 2.
2331000	2332000	I was there.
2332000	2334000	It was on sale. Yeah, you were there. You did come with us.
2334000	2337000	White Knight Chronicles 2 we bought on sale for 40 bucks.
2337000	2344000	And it comes complete with the first game, which I did play a little bit before when it was actually done by Sony.
2344000	2347000	But now this game has been out in Japan and Europe for a while.
2347000	2355000	But D3 finally put it out here because I guess the first game didn't do so hot, but it has a real cult following to it.
2355000	2361000	So now the second game's out. It's a lot like the.hack games on PS2.
2361000	2367000	You can play the first game all over. Well, actually, you couldn't even do this in the.hack games because they didn't come with each game.
2367000	2371000	But imagine if like the first.hack, what?.hack infection and the next one.
2371000	2377000	Like imagine if they were bundled together. You can either start the first game, which is what they called the remastered version,
2377000	2385000	although I call it the they made the annoying text box slightly less annoying and a couple other little things you probably won't notice.
2385000	2389000	Or you could just start the second game at level 35.
2389000	2392000	But I'm like, well, I'm going to go back and play the first game.
2392000	2397000	So I've been playing the first game and I've already played it longer, much longer than I did the last time.
2397000	2402000	My characters are up to like level 19 or 20 at this point. And I just I keep doing side quests.
2402000	2408000	I've got pulled into there's so much different types of micromanaging you can do that I think people don't even know about this game.
2408000	2417000	Like you can build a whole little town and depending on the villagers that you recruit, you earn different products that are in this town.
2417000	2422000	There's a whole online mode in this game that feels a lot like Phantasy Star to me.
2422000	2426000	You team up with other people to do quests and you can do them online.
2426000	2433000	But here's the thing, despite the fact that I say all this and I mentioned I've been playing this game for a lot,
2433000	2438000	although it lets you do these things, it does none of them remarkably well.
2438000	2446000	Like it's not a bad game, but it's just a it does a lot of things, but none of them are best in class.
2446000	2451000	But it's like a game to get straight B's across the board.
2451000	2457000	None of the like the story is not really an A. The graphics are pretty good.
2457000	2462000	The music's good, but it's not great. The character design, it's neat, but there's a lot of repetition.
2462000	2469000	So it could be it's like it gets straight B's. But he put it all together and it makes for a really deep experience.
2469000	2470000	It's like Xanadu.
2470000	2475000	I guess. I don't know. But yeah, I can't stop playing. I'm just like grind, grind, grind, grind.
2475000	2479000	I could be playing Skyrim, yet I'm playing this game because it's like I have to beat story mode.
2479000	2482000	I have to get to level. I have to get to the White Knight Chronicles 2.
2482000	2485000	I have to be able to play with people online. I can't stop playing.
2485000	2487000	Couple other negatives I'll say about the game.
2487000	2495000	Really disappointed that there was an online store mode where you buy things for your village like houses and scenery.
2495000	2503000	But this stuff will impact the amount of stuff that you can grow, which in turn is what's for sale at your stores.
2503000	2508000	So that's my long way of saying you can buy your way to a competitive edge in this game.
2508000	2518000	And it's not just that, but they actually sell items at the Sony store that are like this coupon is good for 20% increased experience for one week.
2518000	2525000	So there's a lot of like really cheap stuff like that. And I almost want to flunk the game on those grounds alone.
2525000	2534000	However, I do have to realize there is this online component that they're not charging money for that does have about the depth of Phantasy Star Universe.
2534000	2539000	And Phantasy Star Universe does still charge money to this day. Why they just don't go free to play, I don't know.
2539000	2545000	So I give it a slight pass on those grounds because I feel like, okay, well, fair enough.
2545000	2549000	They are providing a robust online component. They got to make the money for that somewhere, I guess.
2549000	2556000	But I do frown on the fact that they sell things to give you a competitive edge. That shit is just...
2556000	2560000	As a gamer, it bothers me. I don't like it in other games too.
2560000	2566000	Let's see, actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelsonshooty.com says,
2566000	2572000	Wait, White Knot Chronicles 2 has both games? I'm going to tell a friend that wants it to get that instead of the first one.
2572000	2578000	Oh, absolutely. The first game is pointless at this point. Like, if you can get it 10 bucks used, awesome.
2578000	2583000	And you can import what you do in the first game into the second game. You can do that.
2583000	2587000	You don't have to just start at level 35 because the level cap in the first game was 50.
2587000	2590000	So you grind your way to 50 and then do it that way.
2590000	2594000	Yeah, there's really no point. And this game is probably not that expensive.
2594000	2599000	White Knot Chronicles 2 is 40 bucks on sale. But that was a pre-Black Friday type sale.
2599000	2603000	When did we go to Evil G, Dark Sakura? Was that Wednesday?
2603000	2606000	I think so, yeah.
2606000	2609000	You can probably find it used even cheaper somewhere else.
2609000	2618000	Maybe. But be careful because it has an online pass called GeoNet. So you can't do any of the online features without the...
2618000	2622000	You get the one free with the new copy and then it's going to be $10 otherwise.
2622000	2624000	It was Sunday. Sunday morning.
2624000	2627000	That's right, because the show didn't happen.
2627000	2631000	Yeah. But we went in the morning because I was running away from the football game.
2631000	2636000	Yeah, yeah. So anyway, White Knot Chronicles 2. Straight Bs, yet I can't stop playing it. Go figure.
2636000	2645000	And then here's a game that I've also been playing a lot of. And it's Super Mario 3DS.
2645000	2652000	And I gotta say, I'm just going to be blunt, this is my favorite Mario game in the past 20 years, I think. For real.
2652000	2657000	I think this is my favorite Mario game since Super Mario World, I think.
2657000	2664000	It's great. If you own a 3DS, I don't know why you would not get this game.
2664000	2669000	I seriously do not know why you would be a Nintendo supporter and not want Mario 3D Land.
2669000	2673000	It is outstanding. The level design is fantastic.
2673000	2680000	There's a lot of throwbacks to a lot of things you see in the Mario series, as well as some new stuff like the whole Boomerang Mario.
2680000	2686000	But yeah, I can't stop thinking about the level design. The level design is so good.
2686000	2698000	They're linear levels, like what you would see in a Mario game, yet they have that slight openness of like Mario 64, yet they're not too damn open.
2698000	2702000	Like I think some of the levels in that game and even like Galaxy and Sunshine were.
2702000	2708000	Like there definitely is that Mario linear path to it. And I don't think that's a bad thing at all.
2708000	2711000	There's just a lot of fun things that you find in different levels.
2711000	2718000	Like some of them are the automatic scrolling levels. Some of them are like the donuts. Some of them are the blocks that spin.
2718000	2723000	The ghost houses are back. The desert levels are there. I mean, it's all there.
2723000	2729000	And from what I understand, the game, you can play through it twice because you have Mario 3D.
2729000	2737000	Believe it or not, it's neat. I was not the biggest fan of Mario 64, and I've taken shit for that on this show over the years.
2737000	2741000	And a lot of that was because I didn't like the transition from 2D to 3D.
2741000	2747000	Like, you know, Mario 64 was one of the first big 3D games, and I realize a lot of people disagree with me on that, and that's fine.
2747000	2751000	Every gamer gets their own opinion. So I was a little worried about this at first.
2751000	2762000	But I think because the levels still feel somewhat linear-esque to me, but still have a sense of openness to them, I'm not bothered by the 3D at all.
2762000	2770000	And the actual 3D effects are cool, and they're with purpose in some places.
2770000	2777000	And, like, there's some kind of puzzle rooms, for lack of a better term, that you actually kind of use 3D in.
2777000	2782000	Can you play it in 2D? Yes. Would it look as good? No, it doesn't look as good.
2782000	2784000	So you think they've really got the hang of the 3D now?
2784000	2795000	I do, and I'll tell you one thing I love, love, and I think all the 3DS games need to do this, is they have a switch now that not only can you adjust the intensity of the 3D,
2795000	2806000	but with the switch of the D-pad, if you press the up arrow, then the 3D is up, like it's outward 3D, whereas if you hit the down arrow, it's inward 3D.
2806000	2812000	That's cool. That may not make a lot of sense the way I'm saying it, but when you play it, you'll see what I mean.
2812000	2816000	It's instead of, one will project, the other will immerse.
2816000	2824000	Yes, and this can help some of the effects, like depending on your eyes, like sometimes I notice if I'm playing the projector 3D,
2824000	2833000	there's these stages where these spiked ball things will kind of swing back and forth, like out.
2833000	2838000	Well, sometimes the 3DS does this thing where when they swing forth, your vision starts to split.
2838000	2839000	Get the ghosting.
2839000	2843000	Yeah, you see the ghosting and all that, but if you do the inward 3D, I don't see that at all.
2843000	2851000	That's probably how I would have to play the whole thing, given that every other thing I've played on a 3DS, I get the problem all the time.
2851000	2855000	You can kind of choose what 3D works for you.
2855000	2864000	So, let's see, go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaundryday.com and looking at some comments here.
2864000	2870000	DDRDollarBill says, please tell me it's not like Mario 64. It's not like Mario 64.
2870000	2876000	In my opinion, it's better, and there's going to be a lot of people that disagree with me on that, and that's fine.
2876000	2882000	Let's see, SGA100Matt says, Rob, you're not the only person I've heard say this.
2882000	2887000	Let's see, Actf says, I liked Super Mario 64, but I get why people don't like it.
2887000	2890000	Heck, my favorite Mario game is still Super Mario World.
2890000	2894000	Mine too. Mario 3D Land is not without flaw.
2894000	2898000	For instance, the StreetPass stuff is weird.
2898000	2909000	Like, you have these mystery boxes that are very similar to the Toad Houses, where if you can clear a mystery box in like 10 or 15 seconds, you might get a chance at a bonus coin.
2909000	2916000	And I guess the deal with is that if you StreetPass with people, all it does is it's like they give you a new mystery box.
2916000	2923000	And it's not necessarily one that they've played, or I don't think it really is anything but, hey, you got a little bonus because you StreetPassed with someone.
2923000	2927000	So that's kind of a little like, boy, that seems somewhat forced.
2927000	2936000	So to that, I say derp derp, but it doesn't really detract from the single-player game experience, which is still great.
2936000	2943000	I mean, StreetPassing will allow you to get more bonus coins, I think, which will allow you to get some of the levels and stuff.
2943000	2947000	But if you're really good at single-player, you could still do it.
2947000	2951000	You know, bro, one week from today, Mario Kart 7.
2951000	2958000	I know. See, there's been a lot of skepticism about the 3DS, and rightfully so.
2958000	2963000	Because this game blows any of the launch titles out of the fucking water, including Street Fighter IV.
2963000	2965000	Yeah, they launched with this?
2965000	2967000	They should have launched with this.
2967000	2973000	Now, maybe there's a method to the madness, maybe they didn't want to have the sell-outs, which would seem weird for Nintendo,
2973000	2977000	but maybe they wanted to launch it early and have this slow build, I don't know.
2977000	2980000	Or maybe they legitimately thought it would launch heavier than it did.
2980000	2985000	But if this game can't sell the 3DS, nothing will.
2988000	2989000	It's as simple as that.
2989000	2997000	If the 3DS, if this game does not carry 3DS sales, there really is nothing else they can put out on it.
2997000	2998000	I truly believe that.
2998000	3001000	This Mario game is about as good as the Nintendo game gets.
3001000	3003000	It's better than Galaxy.
3003000	3006000	It's better than New Super Mario Bros. Wii. I really think so.
3006000	3009000	Is it better than Sunshine? Because Sunshine was pretty epic.
3009000	3011000	Yes, it's better than Sunshine.
3013000	3016000	And some people think Sunshine was ass.
3016000	3022000	I think it was a lot better than... I don't get how you can like Mario 64 and hate Sunshine,
3022000	3025000	but I guess it has to do with the whole water element, but whatever.
3025000	3028000	I actually like 64 a whole lot.
3028000	3034000	I like 64, but I don't think it's... I like this game better. I really do.
3035000	3037000	This is going to be one of the best games of the year, period.
3037000	3039000	This is a great year for games.
3039000	3046000	I'm seriously sitting back going, how can I choose between Mario 3D Land, Portal 2, and Skyrim,
3046000	3050000	which one of these games is the best game of the year, because they are all fucking good.
3050000	3052000	Like, really fucking good.
3052000	3054000	And there's some games I haven't even touched yet.
3054000	3059000	I'm hearing amazing things about Zelda Skyward Sword, which I'm sure a lot of us are.
3059000	3061000	I don't think any of us in the room, oddly enough, have touched that yet,
3061000	3064000	but I'm hoping to get my hands on it before the end of the year.
3064000	3066000	There's a lot I still haven't played.
3066000	3068000	This has been a great year for games. It really has.
3068000	3074000	Thankfully, as far as releases go, aside from Mario Kart 7,
3074000	3080000	there's no real big major releases in games until the end of January.
3081000	3084000	So you got a few weeks to catch up on some stuff, at least.
3088000	3090000	SalaciousPop in our chat room says,
3090000	3094000	Sunshine was pretty terrible, to be honest, but I also hated 64.
3094000	3097000	I didn't see his thoughts on this one, but I can tell you, since we're playing on the same cartridge,
3097000	3099000	he's been playing quite a bit.
3099000	3103000	He's about as far in the game as I am, so I'm thinking he's liking this one.
3103000	3105000	So I'm hearing there's a lot of stuff.
3105000	3108000	I don't want to spoil things more than I probably already have,
3108000	3112000	but I hear there's a lot of stuff you can kind of unlock if you do really well on a lot of the levels,
3112000	3115000	and I think that's great. It kind of gives the game some value.
3115000	3118000	And obviously, there's the coins that you can go back and get and so forth.
3118000	3126000	But I get the sense that unlike 64, where you had to play the same level over and over to get the stars and all that,
3126000	3133000	if you don't get a single coin in the damn game, I think you can still beat it.
3133000	3139000	I think you can still fight Bowser and beat the game, but you will miss ten bonus levels.
3139000	3142000	You'll miss the chance to unlock the extra game.
3142000	3145000	I think there's a lot to build for.
3148000	3152000	Anyhow, yeah, good gaming week.
3152000	3155000	And I still have to play more Skyrim, I really do.
3155000	3159000	And after the Civilization sale on Steam the other day, I was like,
3159000	3161000	we need to have another Civ night.
3161000	3165000	So anyway, it's a great time to be a gamer. It really is.
3165000	3168000	Well, I have one more little thing.
3168000	3171000	Sure. What do you want to throw out there before we get into some gaming news?
3171000	3177000	Well, when you were talking about Umlaut, I forgot to mention that I designed the badges and tickets this year.
3177000	3182000	So everyone needs to go and hold on to my work forever.
3182000	3186000	So your graphic design chatter on this show is not for naught,
3186000	3191000	because now your stuff is actually going to be a part of this gaming event. That's really cool.
3191000	3195000	And no, you don't get to preview everyone. I can't show anybody.
3195000	3197000	Yeah, you have to go to the event and find out.
3197000	3198000	Rob's seen it though.
3198000	3201000	Well, I can't say anything about it. Go to the show and find out.
3201000	3203000	You can tell them it looks good.
3203000	3206000	Yes, it looks very professional. It does. It looks very professional.
3206000	3213000	I don't know how much I can and can't say on air, but I will just say,
3213000	3219000	understanding the source material, you did a really good job making everything consistent.
3219000	3223000	And kind of putting your own spin on it. So I think that's awesome.
3223000	3226000	That was the goal. Branding was the big thing.
3226000	3233000	It was actually really fun to do. Probably one of the fastest I've ever gotten anything accomplished.
3233000	3243000	But yeah, so for people who actually can't make it, they'll be up on my portfolio after the event's over.
3243000	3248000	I'm supposed to be doing something as well, but I don't think I'm at liberty to say yet.
3248000	3252000	I haven't seen – once the official word is out there, I'll be able to say something.
3252000	3256000	So that's all I can say. But I really hope you're going this year.
3256000	3258000	Everyone be there.
3258000	3260000	If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you really should go to them loud.
3260000	3261000	Fly out.
3261000	3262000	Join us.
3262000	3268000	All right. Quick housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
3268000	3271000	Follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3271000	3273000	And hey, we're now on Google+.
3273000	3278000	That happened, the show we weren't at last week, but we are now on Google+, as well.
3278000	3282000	Unfortunately, Google did not smarten up and let you have a custom URL,
3282000	3285000	but it's really easy to find us on there just in your little Google Plus search box.
3285000	3291000	Look for Orange Lounge Radio, and it'll probably pop up by the time you get Orange and L in there.
3291000	3296000	So keep an eye out for that and plus one S and all that stuff on Google+.
3296000	3298000	All right. Let's get into some gaming news.
3298000	3300000	We're like, what, an hour into the show with all the games that we played this week?
3300000	3302000	Let's actually get into some gaming news.
3302000	3304000	It's actually a good thing we spent an hour talking about gaming weeks
3304000	3309000	because our show is a little bit abbreviated this week because of the website problems.
3309000	3311000	We don't have quite as much news as usual.
3311000	3317000	And it is also a slow news week because it's been a big holiday here in the States.
3317000	3319000	There's a few big stories we're going to get to here.
3319000	3323000	I will say also though, look forward to this, in Part B tonight,
3323000	3326000	listless returns in Part B tonight.
3326000	3329000	We love to fill slow news weeks with OLR games.
3329000	3332000	So listless coming up tonight in Part B. Okay, sorry, Loki, your turn.
3332000	3338000	Okay. So Sony is reporting that the PlayStation Move has shipped 9 million units,
3338000	3343000	and a million of those have been over the past half year.
3343000	3348000	Of course, there's a lot of funky math when you go to look at this.
3348000	3351000	One, it's unit shipped, not necessarily sold.
3351000	3357000	And two, unlike you can't compare this to the Kinect, where Kinect is a solid unit
3357000	3362000	and that's all you need to use the Kinect, the Move has multiple components.
3362000	3366000	So you can have up to four Move controllers per system.
3366000	3369000	And I'm not even sure if they're counting the navigation controllers
3369000	3372000	or whatever else to go along with that.
3372000	3376000	So who knows what that necessarily means?
3376000	3380000	9 million Move units shipped, I don't know.
3380000	3382000	But hey, it's not bad.
3382000	3390000	I mean, 9 million is a good number, even if it is four per system.
3390000	3391000	All right.
3391000	3396000	I mean, I don't know. It's just doing better than I thought it was.
3396000	3398000	Not bad.
3398000	3401000	Ours is hooked up now. I haven't played it yet.
3401000	3404000	I still have the Move controllers, but I actually have no Move.
3404000	3408000	Well, aside from LittleBigPlanet 2 obviously supports it,
3408000	3413000	but I don't have any Move required games yet.
3413000	3415000	But I don't really play my PlayStation 3 that much either.
3415000	3418000	That's why I loan out all my PlayStation 3 games.
3418000	3421000	That's funny because I've been buying most of my stuff on PS3 lately,
3421000	3423000	and a lot of it comes down to the controller.
3423000	3425000	It really does.
3425000	3429000	But if it's online, with the exception of White Knight Chronicles,
3429000	3433000	which is only a Sony game, if it's online, I usually go for Xbox.
3433000	3435000	If I play multiplayer, it's live.
3435000	3438000	Well, you know what I'm going to be playing a lot of in the next few days?
3438000	3440000	Sega Saturn!
3440000	3441000	Why?
3441000	3443000	Christmas nights.
3443000	3446000	Oh, that's right. I forgot. That's like your yearly little thing.
3446000	3448000	Your fun thing.
3448000	3450000	All right.
3450000	3456000	Well, as far as the Move goes, though, do you think the Move is a wash at this point,
3456000	3460000	or do you think they're still going to try and breathe some life into it?
3460000	3467000	I think that there's still plenty of life to be brought into it,
3467000	3474000	because after all, they support it in most of their first-party games.
3474000	3480000	Like Resistance and Killzone and SOCOM all support the Move,
3480000	3487000	and plus they have a lot of games coming out that are going to be supporting it that are pretty big.
3487000	3490000	Like Bioshock Infinite is going to be supporting the Move.
3490000	3498000	So I think that they do have a good grasp on how to use the Move with hardcore games, per se.
3498000	3500000	Better than the Kinect, that's for sure.
3500000	3507000	I'll give Sony props for that, because the way that they've done Kinect support for the hardcore games,
3507000	3512000	if you will, like Halo and Forza 4, it sucks.
3512000	3514000	It's terrible.
3514000	3517000	I mean, head tracking sounds like a good idea.
3517000	3519000	Not implemented very well at all.
3519000	3521000	And voice commands in Halo, no.
3521000	3522000	It's stupid.
3522000	3524000	It's absolutely terrible.
3524000	3529000	Do you think it's because the Kinect didn't end up being, hardware-wise, what it should have been?
3529000	3531000	Like it should have been a better camera in there?
3531000	3533000	I don't even know if that's the case.
3533000	3537000	I mean, really, if that is the problem, couldn't they revise the hardware?
3537000	3539000	Well, I guess they could separate the user base.
3539000	3540000	Wait for the next Xbox at this point.
3540000	3546000	But, I mean, I don't know. I guess it could have been better, but...
3546000	3548000	Alright.
3548000	3549000	Well, moving on to another story.
3549000	3554000	This was something that had a lot of chatter going on, especially the week that we were off last week,
3554000	3556000	but it's kind of been continuing on this week.
3556000	3560000	And that's about this new act that's in Congress, and it's called SOPA.
3560000	3565000	Not soap. SOPA, which is S-O-P-A, it's short for Stop Online Piracy Act.
3565000	3569000	Now, I'm sure most of you in the gaming community have probably heard about this act already.
3569000	3573000	If you're not aware, basically there is an act that's being explored.
3573000	3577000	It hasn't passed yet, but it's one of those things that's going through the committees,
3577000	3581000	which means it likely could go for a vote, you know, even before, possibly,
3581000	3585000	Congress takes a break for the holidays coming up in December.
3585000	3592000	And, in short, the Stop Online Piracy Act will allow the government to force internet service providers
3592000	3600000	to basically blacklist websites, make it unable to access websites, domain names,
3600000	3605000	based on the fact if they are offering infringing material or not.
3605000	3609000	You know, what they're trying to stop is they basically want to shut down things like the Pirate Bay.
3609000	3613000	Like, that'll be one of the first things that gets thrown up there is that they'll block that domain
3613000	3621000	so that you can no longer pirate, if you've been using that site, you know, videos and movies and so forth and so on.
3621000	3629000	But this is causing a lot of controversy, and the fact is it's kind of like how they are censoring things.
3629000	3634000	And, well, A, a lot of people are saying straight up when you talk censorship of the internet,
3634000	3637000	it's like, dude, this isn't China. Why are we censoring the internet?
3637000	3643000	Blocking websites, that's a China thing. That's what they do there. Why are we doing this?
3643000	3647000	And, you know, obviously what they're trying to do is stop piracy,
3647000	3652000	but unfortunately, you know, this act, I feel, kind of leaves it very vague,
3652000	3660000	because my understanding is that if a company were to complain that this website is offering infringing material,
3660000	3663000	that website could just get shut down. Oh, hold on a minute.
3663000	3666000	We have something here in this country called Due Process.
3666000	3672000	Well, actually, I believe they do. It's not as simple as, you know, they complain about it.
3672000	3678000	It does actually have to go in front of a judge to say, okay, here's our evidence that this site's doing that.
3678000	3686000	But it's not just sites that have pirated material. It's sites that they claim facilitate finding that.
3686000	3690000	So, like, Google, for example.
3690000	3696000	Pfizer's behind this because it's also targeting websites that sell, like, fake Viagra.
3696000	3698000	Pfizer's the drug company that created Viagra.
3698000	3705000	And, you know, how much spam mail do we get every day about go to this Canadian pharmacy website that sells Viagra or whatever it is?
3705000	3708000	Yeah, but we're still going to get that spam. I mean, that's not going to go away.
3708000	3712000	Oh, God, if it was going to get rid of the spam, that would be awesome, but no.
3712000	3718000	There's a couple ways. Oh, and why? I didn't even really get to the story. I was giving the background on this.
3718000	3721000	A lot of gaming companies have come out actually in support of this.
3721000	3724000	Like, Nintendo's in support of it. I believe Microsoft finally came out.
3724000	3728000	At first they weren't. Now they are. Sony's in support of it. A lot of the game companies.
3728000	3731000	Hollywood loves it. Hollywood wants this.
3731000	3733000	Hollywood's the one, yeah, trying to push this through.
3733000	3735000	Hollywood's trying to push it through.
3735000	3737000	Somebody finally came out this week against it.
3737000	3745000	And it's, like, of course the EFF's against it and all that, but it's the Business Software Alliance, the BSA, came out against this.
3745000	3752000	Even though originally they commended the idea, the BSA, or the Business Software Alliance, the CEO of them,
3752000	3758000	Robert Holliman, put in a blog post that they do not support the bill as it is because SOPA needs to, quote,
3758000	3766000	balance key innovation, privacy, and security considerations with the need to thwart the threat rogue websites pose.
3766000	3774000	Also, quote, definitions of who can be the subject of legal actions and what remedies are imposed must be tightened and narrowed.
3774000	3779000	Due process, free speech, and privacy are rights cannot be compromised.
3779000	3783000	BSA has long stood against filtering or monitoring the internet.
3783000	3793000	And I totally agree with this guy, is that I understand if they want to do something about piracy and the fake drugs,
3793000	3798000	everything that spam targets, I'm all for you trying to clean that shit up off the internet.
3798000	3807000	But where do you draw the line? You know, because filtering the internet, that's not what we do here.
3807000	3814000	You know what I mean? Like, I'm really torn, because whereas I'm like, okay, if they want to stop piracy, they have a right to stop piracy.
3814000	3817000	Well, they can't really stop piracy. What they're doing is just blocking access to these sites,
3817000	3821000	because these sites operate in countries that don't have the same piracy laws as we do.
3821000	3828000	So really, as far as jurisdiction goes in the US, there's nothing they can do about it other than block them. That's it.
3828000	3838000	And what's great about this act, and you can obviously tell that the person that drafted this really knows their internet,
3838000	3845000	it only blocks domain names. You know what domain names are, right? They're just basically easy ways for you to remember an IP address.
3845000	3853000	It's your cell phone book. Like, seriously, in this day and age, how many people actually have all the numbers in their cell phone book memorized?
3853000	3857000	Very few. You might know your parents, you might know your significant other, but that's about it.
3857000	3861000	I don't know my significant other's phone number. I don't.
3861000	3862000	And here's the thing, though.
3862000	3865000	That's okay, I don't know your significant phone number either.
3865000	3866000	It's in my phone.
3866000	3872000	Okay, there's a bunch of things that they're assuming to be true. First off, these websites or whatever,
3872000	3878000	obviously if they feel that they're going to be threatened or taken down or whatever, they're just going to give you the IP address.
3878000	3881000	You type in the IP address, boom, you're at the website. It's not blocked.
3881000	3886000	Two, they're assuming that you're using the DNS server that's provided to you by your internet provider.
3886000	3892000	But guess what? You can also forward that to a different DNS server that can be run by anybody, even yourself.
3892000	3898000	I think at the end of the day, you have to hold these websites responsible and that's the only way to stop the problem.
3898000	3901000	It's not that easy because they're not all in America.
3901000	3909000	Here's the problem, though. Much like piracy and stuff, they're going to try all these things to try to stop piracy,
3909000	3914000	but all it's going to do is hurt other people and not necessarily get rid of the piracy problem.
3914000	3921000	The problem is just like everything else with piracy, just like we've seen time and time again,
3921000	3926000	every time they've tried to do something such as, let's say, Ubisoft DRM, right?
3926000	3930000	You're not connected to the internet, the game shuts down. Pirates had it cracked in two days.
3930000	3933000	Who did that shit ultimately hurt? The legitimate users.
3933000	3937000	And that's going to be the problem with SOPA, is that the pirates will find their way around it in two days.
3937000	3943000	Who's going to ultimately get hurt? The legitimate users who are trying to access a website like AllGames.com
3943000	3948000	who suddenly got yanked because, I don't know, fucking Namco or somebody didn't like
3948000	3953000	that they were playing the music from a 25-year-old video game or something, you know?
3953000	3959000	Like, legitimate people are going to end up getting hurt. That's the problem.
3959000	3965000	And if it's anything like, you know, I've read kind of these horror stories about some file sharing sites
3965000	3972000	where Warner Brothers, they were sending cease and desist basically for files that weren't even their properties.
3972000	3979000	It just happened to have, like, names of their stuff. Part of the title was sharing their names.
3979000	3983000	I called my hard drive Batman, so Warner Brothers wants to shut me down.
3983000	3987000	You know, something like that. Or like, you know, even like YouTube.
3987000	3993000	Well, YouTube videos now, I mean, obviously, they can pull it if there's a complaint or something like that.
3993000	4000000	But it's just going to be really hard for them to do it, and I just have a feeling that even if this law passes,
4000000	4005000	I don't think it's going to do anything. Did those, like, what was it? The digital...
4005000	4007000	I don't even remember what the hell is.
4007000	4009000	The millennium... Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
4009000	4014000	Yeah, basically the DVD copying thing. Did that stop people from copying DVDs?
4014000	4021000	Nope. Nothing. So people find a way around it, and it's just, it's unfortunate.
4021000	4025000	If you don't like the direction these folks are heading in, it's time to vote them out.
4025000	4032000	Because, you know, I admit, I'm sitting here going, I understand where this might be an issue or whatever,
4032000	4036000	but I can think of a lot of things that are a bigger issue right now, and that is like, you know,
4036000	4041000	I don't know, the fact that the whole country is going down the shitter, and people are very upset about that.
4041000	4044000	You know, the whole thing. And I get the...
4044000	4048000	Watch out, Rob, you might get pepper sprayed, and then locked into a detainment camp.
4048000	4052000	We do live just down the street from UC Davis, you know. Not literally down the street,
4052000	4054000	but we're not that far away, all things considered.
4054000	4058000	You know, we used to joke on the... Isn't it a long-running joke on this show?
4058000	4062000	The People's Republic of Davis, abandon all hope, you enter here, and look at what fucking happened!
4062000	4070000	And you all can see it. But anyway, anyway, outside of that joke, yeah, obviously,
4070000	4077000	I do get the element, though, that Hollywood is pissed because piracy is hurting their industry.
4077000	4078000	Because it is.
4078000	4086000	But I think to an extent, there's two things hurting that industry.
4086000	4091000	You could say that piracy is one, but the other thing that's hurting them is their failure to adapt,
4091000	4094000	is killing traditional broadcast networks.
4094000	4100000	Well, their way of adapting is, well, we're just gonna reduce the amount of options that you have.
4100000	4105000	And actually, the stuff that they're doing on the retail side of things is hurting them.
4105000	4111000	Like, for example, there's the 28-day windows, which will soon enough be 60-day windows
4111000	4113000	as soon as those contracts are up next year.
4113000	4120000	60-day windows for movies being in Redbox and also on Netflix.
4120000	4124000	And also, Warner Brothers started...
4124000	4132000	All rental customers are not able to get stuff from distribution and stuff until 60 days after the fact.
4132000	4140000	Including, which is great, one of the first titles to do this, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2.
4140000	4146000	Just two weeks after that window is up, they're pulling Harry Potter out of circulation.
4146000	4149000	All of them. Gone. Out of circulation.
4149000	4153000	Because you have to buy it now. Because you have to.
4153000	4158000	Because it's going out of circulation so they can re-release it later on in a special Uber edition or something.
4158000	4162000	But the fact that there's not rental options for the...
4162000	4167000	I mean, not that there really is rental options because any rental store can go to the store and go buy it.
4167000	4169000	But it's limited because, you know...
4169000	4172000	And when you can't find it, you're like, shit, I'll just download it.
4172000	4174000	Yeah. And it's pretty easy to download stuff.
4174000	4177000	And unfortunately, those customers would have rented it.
4177000	4179000	Hey, maybe you might have liked it and went and bought it.
4179000	4183000	And still, there may be people that download a really crappy copy and they're like,
4183000	4185000	hey, you know what, that movie's pretty good. I'm gonna go buy it.
4185000	4189000	But it just kind of leaves a sour taste in people's mouths.
4189000	4199000	Especially with all the fucking tons of re-releases or remakes or movies based on board games or stupid shit that we don't...
4199000	4201000	Who's had an original idea in the last 50 years?
4201000	4203000	Yeah, there's not a lot of original ideas out there.
4203000	4206000	Lots of chatter in our chat room about this tonight.
4206000	4209000	Again, it's Channel Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.
4209000	4212000	Let me read a few comments here.
4212000	4216000	Game Guru says, I think everyone needs to be voted out, start from scratch.
4216000	4221000	Frisbee says, Hollywood is irrelevant to entertainment anymore.
4221000	4223000	Very interesting quote.
4223000	4228000	Very interesting and very true, I think, in many ways because the whole...
4228000	4230000	Well, look at what we're doing here.
4230000	4232000	We're doing a radio program.
4232000	4236000	We're doing a podcast that people can listen to in their car without having to ever turn on the radio.
4236000	4240000	What about web shows like The Guild, for example?
4240000	4243000	Or viral videos, you know?
4243000	4246000	People at this point would rather watch...
4246000	4254000	They would rather watch cute kitty laughing and giggling videos or the dog that sounds like he's really saying, I love you, than watching Whitney.
4254000	4256000	There's a lot more...
4256000	4258000	Oh, God. That show is terrible.
4258000	4265000	There's a lot more entertainment options out there than there were, say, 30 years ago, whatever.
4265000	4270000	Before when it was just like, okay, you've got radio, you've got movies, and you have TV.
4270000	4272000	That's it.
4272000	4276000	You can read a newspaper or a funny book or something like that, but now it's just the internet.
4276000	4279000	The internet's just got tons of content.
4279000	4281000	Anything you're looking for, it's just right there.
4281000	4287000	That's why these TV shows, if it's a very mediocre TV show, no one gives a fuck.
4287000	4289000	No one's going to watch that.
4289000	4291000	Like Whitney, it was terrible.
4291000	4295000	It just happens to come on sometimes after the office is done.
4295000	4299000	I'm like, ah! Horrible show! Off with you!
4299000	4303000	I just want to sort of, I guess, kind of reign things back.
4303000	4306000	Everyone pay attention who you vote for.
4306000	4310000	Don't vote a party ticket, because that's also just as dangerous.
4310000	4314000	Because that's how assholes get snuck into government positions.
4314000	4318000	Stop and take an effort to read who supports what.
4318000	4322000	Get a take home ballot, or an absentee ballot, that's how I vote every year.
4322000	4324000	Do your homework!
4324000	4326000	Exactly.
4326000	4330000	And then double check every box that you mark right before you mark it.
4330000	4333000	That's the advantage of taking one of those home.
4333000	4336000	You have time to research, you list out the pros and cons,
4336000	4340000	but the biggest thing is actually put some damn effort into your future.
4340000	4345000	I mean, how many people do you know just don't vote because, oh, I don't care?
4345000	4352000	Or, oh, it's too much work for me to go and mark some check boxes or read up on this stuff.
4352000	4354000	Oh, it's too much work.
4354000	4359000	Or, I'm going to buy this product because it's cheap and I don't care if they outsource all of their customer service.
4359000	4362000	You know, that's why it's cheap.
4362000	4366000	Think about what you do before you fucking do it.
4366000	4369000	And put effort into your life.
4369000	4373000	Well, did Dan just laugh from the other room?
4373000	4378000	Yeah, because he's mad at me because I don't have a job yet.
4378000	4382000	You're expressing yourself in other ways.
4382000	4387000	I'd like to express myself at a job. Someone hire me too while you're at it.
4387000	4391000	Well, you did get, I mean, you might not be getting paid for it,
4391000	4394000	but you at least have the fuzzy wuzzy, I contributed to a good cause.
4394000	4400000	Addendum. I want a job that will pay me too.
4400000	4402000	But you don't mind the charity work at all either.
4402000	4404000	I don't mind the charity work, but you don't know how many.
4404000	4405000	Uh oh.
4405000	4410000	You're stealing my shit list for the Warcraft thing.
4410000	4412000	I'm getting yelled at by Dan.
4412000	4419000	And if somebody out there could donate self-defense classes, I'd really appreciate that.
4419000	4424000	No, that's really besides the point.
4424000	4429000	It's when you've got it on a mass scale, that's when we see a problem.
4429000	4433000	It's one little action done by thousands of people can make a difference.
4433000	4437000	You know, if you really want to make a point for Dan, you know what job you should get?
4437000	4439000	You should run for Congress.
4439000	4446000	Fuck no.
4446000	4448000	Dan says, hell yeah, then we could be corrupt and rich.
4448000	4452000	No. No.
4452000	4453000	Awesome. There you go, Dan.
4453000	4458000	I am not going to live a life that I find morally objectionable.
4458000	4465000	I bet you could get like 10 votes from OLR listeners.
4465000	4466000	All right.
4466000	4467000	Moving on.
4467000	4468000	All right.
4468000	4469000	In all seriousness.
4469000	4470000	Can I do my story now?
4470000	4472000	Yes, you may do your story now.
4472000	4474000	We need fuzzy wuzzy happy news.
4474000	4476000	How about indie game music bundle?
4476000	4477000	Yay.
4477000	4479000	10 albums for a dollar.
4479000	4485000	The, um, there's now the indie game music bundle, which is like the humble indie bundle,
4485000	4493000	but you get 10 items for a dollar, um, including, um, stuff from Super Meat Boy and VVVVVVV Minecraft.
4493000	4501000	Um, that's, uh, Minecraft Volume Alpha, uh, Cobalt EP, Super Meat Boy Digital Special Edition Soundtrack,
4501000	4509000	Imposter Nostalgia, Raven Mark Scourge of Astellion, Ares Extinction Agenda, Return All Robots,
4509000	4512000	Mighty Milky Way, Mighty Flip Channel, uh, Champ, sorry.
4512000	4517000	PPPPPPP, the VVVVVVV, OST, and Tree of Knowledge.
4517000	4518000	You said PP.
4518000	4525000	And, um, if you can, uh, contribute more than $10, you also get Wind Up Night, Binding of Isaac, 72 Minutes of Fame,
4525000	4529000	Milk Snake, Anti-Gravity Extreme Road Trip, and Contingency.
4529000	4530000	Okay, seriously?
4530000	4539000	For just the Super Meat Boy and VVVVV or what, PPVVVV, whatever soundtracks, is like worth that whole dollar like 20 times over?
4539000	4541000	You know how I'd pronounce that?
4541000	4542000	Huh.
4542000	4546000	PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR, the VVVVVV, OST.
4546000	4547000	So.
4547000	4548000	There.
4548000	4554000	But, uh, yeah, seriously, I'm just not as familiar with some of the other soundtracks, but I'm sure there's a lot of great chiptuney stuff in there, so, um,
4554000	4558000	You really should think about purchasing this. You really, really should think about that.
4558000	4560000	You know, if you have a dollar.
4560000	4562000	Don't think so hard you give yourself an aneurysm.
4562000	4563000	Yeah, don't do that.
4563000	4564000	All right.
4564000	4566000	But if you do, I'll kinda laugh.
4566000	4568000	Uh, Loki.
4568000	4570320	All right, so let's see.
4570320	4574380	Let's start off with some more cheerful stuff, hopefully.
4577580	4581480	So basically, there may be a sequel to Command & Conquer
4581480	4582720	possibly coming from BioWare.
4582720	4586240	It was teased during a,
4587680	4592680	they actually had a real brief video on teasing, I guess.
4593400	4594760	There's a Spike Video Games Awards
4594760	4596640	right around the corner.
4596640	4598520	And then, of course, there's also a screenshot
4598520	4603240	that's out there as well, and kind of,
4603240	4604840	it's a new BioWare game,
4604840	4607600	and they haven't really said what exactly it is,
4607600	4609800	but it looks kinda neat.
4609800	4613720	Also, there's another studio that's part of the EA,
4615200	4618040	I don't know, the ARM, if you will, Victory Games.
4618040	4621120	They're working on a new strategy title,
4621120	4623940	which people are thinking, hmm, maybe that's a cool,
4623940	4626940	Command & Conquer game, hmm, perhaps.
4628220	4631320	Also, I guess they have another Medal of Honor thing
4631320	4635200	working with one of their other studios, Danger Close.
4635200	4640200	So lots of different studios working under EA.
4640640	4643520	Remember, at one point, EA was just buying up,
4643520	4645280	not necessarily buying up everybody,
4645280	4647520	but publishing everybody.
4647520	4652520	They have, obviously, the new Respawn Entertainment
4652520	4657480	from the former execs of Infinity Ward.
4657480	4658640	You know, they're making something.
4658640	4661620	Obviously, Valve is doing a lot of stuff with them.
4664480	4667000	And then, Crytek as well.
4667000	4668600	Lots of stuff there.
4668600	4670720	But at least the BioWare game,
4670720	4673520	now, of course, right now, they don't know if it,
4673520	4675600	you know, Command & Conquer is really the game or not,
4675600	4676740	or if it's something else.
4676740	4679940	But the BioWare game is gonna be revealed December 10th
4679940	4681720	during the Spike Video Game Awards,
4681720	4686340	and like I said, they had a very, very, very brief trailer
4686340	4688000	of something with tanks.
4688000	4689360	It has tanks in it.
4689360	4690720	How do you feel about Command & Conquer
4690720	4691780	with Dialogue Trees?
4694720	4696280	Weren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?
4696280	4697560	I soon remember this.
4697560	4698980	I used to be, Red Alert.
4698980	4700360	Red Alert was awesome.
4700360	4702800	But I haven't played Command & Conquer in a long time.
4702800	4704140	In fact, the last one that came out,
4704140	4705640	I just didn't really care for.
4707920	4708980	Well, it could be good, though,
4708980	4710800	if they turned it over to a new studio
4710800	4712920	to kind of give it a creative energy reboot,
4712920	4714160	that could be a good thing, right?
4714160	4715000	Yeah, and I'm not even sure.
4715000	4716760	I mean, there's a lot of studios working on stuff.
4716760	4718400	It could be BioWare that's doing it.
4718400	4719640	I think BioWare's actually gonna be
4719640	4721460	a different game altogether.
4721460	4722300	The thought is, though,
4722300	4726380	that Victory Games is gonna be doing this,
4726380	4729480	but I have no idea who the hell Victory Games is.
4729480	4732120	So, I guess they're a new strategy studio.
4732120	4736240	And, you know, strategy games for EA,
4736240	4739280	I mean, really, there was the Lord of the Rings games
4739280	4741920	that they had and Command & Conquer.
4741920	4746040	So, since Lord of the Rings is not part of EA anymore,
4746040	4748220	I'm gonna go on a limb and say
4748220	4751500	probably gonna be a Command & Conquer game at some point.
4751500	4753720	Or maybe, hey, a new IP, maybe a new IP.
4753720	4754920	You never know, that could be two.
4754920	4755740	That'd be good.
4756680	4759120	All right, well, let's move on to another story.
4759120	4762840	And this is about a possible answer to Smash Brothers
4762840	4764420	that Sony is making.
4764420	4765920	Now, I should say this.
4765920	4767420	I always thought that move game,
4767420	4768800	what was that called, Move Fighters?
4768800	4770260	Or something fighters?
4770260	4771220	The one that was on Sony?
4771220	4772600	I thought that was supposed to be their answer
4772600	4774840	to Smash Brothers, but I guess not really.
4774840	4775680	What, which one?
4775680	4778280	What the hell's that game that's on Sony move?
4778280	4779280	Is it Pocket Fighters?
4779280	4780700	No, nothing else.
4781920	4782960	I think you're thinking of, like,
4782960	4785320	there is a Kung Fu game that was on there.
4785320	4786160	Yeah, maybe, I don't know.
4786160	4787600	Somebody in chow yell it out.
4787600	4788720	I don't remember the original game,
4788720	4790880	but the one that they have coming to Kinect,
4790880	4793400	that's exactly the same as Kung Fu High Impact.
4793400	4794940	No, no, I'm not thinking of that, something else.
4794940	4796000	But anyway, it's fine.
4796000	4798040	There apparently is something a little more,
4798040	4799960	I don't know if you wanna say mainstream or what,
4799960	4802280	but I guess something that's a little more directly,
4802280	4804120	I don't wanna say either a Smash Brothers ripoff,
4804120	4806500	but something that's supposedly in development.
4806500	4810440	There's a lot of stuff that's leaking through this blog
4810440	4812360	called paulgalenetwork.com.
4812360	4814400	I'm not sure this gentleman's relation
4814400	4816020	to the gaming industry,
4816020	4817760	but a lot of the other gaming blogs
4817760	4819080	have picked up and ran with this,
4819080	4822560	where Title Fight is apparently the development
4823760	4825700	work in progress name of this.
4825700	4828840	And some information that's in this,
4828840	4832080	it is very similar to Super Smash Brothers.
4832080	4834440	It's the special moves and all those attacks,
4834440	4835880	you kinda do the same way.
4837320	4838940	Apparently there are some characters
4838940	4840280	already noticed in this,
4840280	4843180	and they kinda come in light and heavy flavors,
4843180	4846120	meaning like who moves slowly, who moves lightly.
4846120	4850000	Heavier characters include Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal,
4850000	4852760	Colonel Male Retic, Fat Princess.
4852760	4856040	Some of the lighter characters include Parappa the Rappa,
4856040	4857760	that's kinda awesome if he's in a fighting game,
4857760	4861720	Kratos, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake.
4861720	4864440	Not sure if there's anything about a story mode
4864440	4866160	or anything like that at this time,
4866160	4869440	but yeah, I guess some information's
4869440	4870560	starting to leak out about this,
4870560	4872440	that this could be I guess something you might see
4872440	4873280	at next year's E3.
4873280	4876240	Well, another interesting thing I heard
4876240	4878000	is that there's a commercial right now
4878000	4880720	that Sony's running called the Michael Commercial.
4880720	4881720	Have you seen this?
4881720	4883480	It's floating around where it's like,
4883480	4885120	you know, we need Michael, we need Michael,
4885120	4886880	and it's like all these Sony characters
4886880	4888360	as real life people acting,
4888360	4891120	it's actually one of the better Sony commercials in a while,
4891120	4894840	but it's all these people as real life Sony characters,
4894840	4897240	we need Michael, and Michael is the player
4897240	4898680	who takes down the controller,
4898680	4902000	and it's all like be a part of the game or whatever.
4902000	4905560	And some people are saying maybe this is teasing
4905560	4909440	this whole Sony smorgasbord of characters, this project.
4909440	4912360	Cause I could certainly see this as being the big Sony
4912360	4915880	reveal of next year's E3,
4915880	4919200	because now that the Vita will already be out there,
4919200	4921800	maybe there's gonna be something about this game
4921800	4923560	and how it works between the Vita,
4923560	4925160	it could be a Vita title for all we know,
4925160	4927560	but how it works between the Vita and the PS3 and all that.
4927560	4931440	So could be neat, right?
4931440	4932320	It could be neat.
4932320	4935000	I love the idea of characters like Parappa the Rappa,
4935000	4936880	like I kind of forget about how many characters
4936880	4937720	Sony really has in their pocket.
4937720	4939800	I wonder if he's gonna give you a paper cut.
4939800	4941880	He might, it could be something he does,
4941880	4946880	or Umjama Lamy if she's in it, I'm there, but we'll see.
4948040	4952960	Milk can, yeah, my guitar is in my mind.
4952960	4954440	It would be interesting to see too,
4954440	4957400	if they were able to get from some of the other developers,
4957400	4959720	you know, kind of like how Smash Brothers had Sonic Snake
4959720	4962520	and what was it in the commercial?
4962520	4963360	Sonic.
4963360	4965400	Sonic, hello, was in the game.
4965400	4967320	It would be interesting to see if Sony could get things
4967320	4969120	that were very iconically Sony,
4969120	4971880	like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7.
4971880	4973920	Final Fantasy 7 was a huge Sony thing.
4973920	4974880	Cause that was when the franchise
4974880	4976200	jumped over to PlayStation.
4977160	4978600	Could be interesting.
4978600	4979960	Could be very interesting.
4982320	4983160	All right.
4983160	4984360	All right, what are we doing now?
4984360	4985880	Moving on to some release dates, right?
4985880	4987240	It's traveling around the world
4987240	4990120	and check out what's coming out to a store this week.
4990120	4993240	I imagine it's dying down significantly, but let's see.
4993240	4995320	Yeah, incredibly dying down.
4995320	4997080	A few things.
4997080	4999560	There's some cool new combo packs they have
4999560	5002280	with controller and game bundles.
5002280	5004000	They did this kind of last year.
5004000	5006280	And so Sony's got some of those.
5006280	5008240	One of them's Uncharted,
5008240	5010000	the dual pack with Uncharted one and two,
5010000	5013480	and then you get a dual shot controller.
5013480	5015440	I believe it's blue.
5015440	5017280	And then they have one that's in black
5017280	5020280	that comes with the Resistance one and two dual pack.
5020280	5023800	And there's also one with the God of War Origins collection.
5023800	5025760	It's, I believe, red.
5025760	5027560	Those are all on PlayStation 3.
5030480	5031320	Let's see here.
5031320	5034400	Jaws Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.
5035600	5039040	Face Racers Photo Finish on 3DS.
5039040	5040840	Nano Assault on 3DS.
5040840	5043520	But really the only 3DS game you should really care about
5043520	5045600	is Mario Kart 7.
5045600	5047400	And that's coming out one week from today.
5047400	5048600	That's it.
5048600	5050320	Oh my God, one week from today?
5050320	5051560	That's awesome. One week from today.
5051560	5053080	I can't believe it.
5053080	5054120	All right.
5054120	5057280	Well, let's take a look at Japan and what they're getting.
5057280	5058480	They're actually getting a little bit more,
5058480	5059680	and I think a lot of that is because
5059680	5061280	they're getting some of the localized versions
5061280	5063880	of stuff that already came out for us.
5063880	5066040	In fact, when you look at the Xbox 360 releases
5066040	5068080	on December 1st, it looks a lot like that.
5068080	5069920	Assassin's Creed Revelations comes out
5069920	5072720	as well as Dragon Age Origins gets a reduction.
5072720	5075640	It's going into the Platinum Collection on Xbox 360.
5075640	5076900	Sonic Generations.
5076900	5080280	Shiro no Jiku is the subtitle for it over there,
5080280	5081120	comes out this week,
5081120	5083160	as well as King of Fighters XIII makes its way out
5083160	5084240	in Japan this week.
5084240	5086120	Also one other game on the 360 this week,
5086120	5089320	a game called Ever17 comes out in regular
5089320	5091120	and limited edition flavors.
5091120	5093000	I'm not sure what this game is all about.
5093000	5096760	It's an adventure game, but I'm noticing it's, you know,
5096760	5098720	anime chicks in school girl outfits.
5098720	5101480	And in this one clip, I kid you not, I'm looking,
5101480	5104000	she's holding a hamster and like talking to the hamster.
5104000	5107200	So I don't know if she's like the hamster whisperer or what,
5107200	5108320	but that's Ever17.
5108320	5109640	Is that an anime?
5109640	5110480	Maybe it's an anime.
5110480	5112840	No, I don't really watch anime anymore.
5112840	5113680	Rama's in chat.
5113680	5114960	He'll jump in if that's an anime I'm not aware of.
5114960	5116040	Actually, I take that back.
5116040	5118520	I've been watching a whole crap load of Evangelion lately.
5118520	5119360	Have you really?
5119360	5120200	Why that?
5120200	5123520	Cause the new series is out, the Rebuild of Evangelion.
5123520	5126060	And I've watched the first part already,
5126060	5128200	but I started watching some of the second part
5128200	5129920	cause they changed quite a bit of the story.
5129920	5131080	And then the third one's out.
5131080	5136080	And so I sat reading the entire Wiki, Evangelion Wiki,
5136200	5137600	just like, oh, that's it.
5137600	5139040	Okay, cool.
5139040	5141120	Going to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan,
5141120	5143720	Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus comes out this week,
5143720	5145060	as well as the Sonic Generations
5145060	5146920	and King of Fighters 13 releases.
5146920	5150100	Also on the Sony system this week, Tekken Hybrid.
5150100	5151680	You know, I saw this at Target.
5151680	5152820	We have a version here in America
5152820	5154320	that I think just came out this week.
5154320	5157960	And I had like, Alan picked it up off the shelf
5157960	5160400	and was like, I didn't know that this was coming out.
5160400	5162520	And I was like, shit, I didn't know about this one either.
5162520	5164440	But yeah, this is, what the hell?
5164440	5166640	It's like Tag Tournament and?
5166640	5168560	It's Tag Tournament HD.
5168560	5173480	There's a Tag Tournament 2 preview
5173480	5176640	and then also Tekken Bowling,
5176640	5179240	but I think that's also part of Tag Tournament.
5179240	5180880	And it's all in 3D?
5180880	5184160	Well, no, it's just those games,
5184160	5189000	plus it's also the Tekken 3D animated movie
5189000	5191880	that just came out as a 3D Blu-ray.
5191880	5192700	Got it.
5192700	5195860	So Hybrid as far as, is both a movie and both a game.
5195860	5197920	So like, you can even take that game
5197920	5199520	and play it in a regular Blu-ray player
5199520	5202280	and you can watch the movie in 3D if you want.
5202280	5204680	Or you can just, and what's great though
5204680	5207840	is remember the new Tekken game that's coming out in 3DS
5207840	5210400	will also have that movie in 3D on it,
5210400	5212380	which is pretty cool.
5212380	5214140	Gotta hit up my Namco guy.
5215320	5218560	All right, just a reminder that the PS Vita
5218560	5220720	is three weeks away, December 17th.
5220720	5222080	So. In Japan.
5222080	5223360	In Japan, not here,
5223360	5225240	but I am doing Japanese releases right now.
5225240	5226280	That's true.
5226280	5230800	Sony PSP this week, since that's still the Sony system.
5230800	5234880	Only big release is Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 4Z
5234880	5235720	comes out this week.
5235720	5239680	That's from Namco Bando and it's an action related title
5239680	5244180	that looks like kind of a 3D-esque robot fighting game,
5244180	5246180	kind of like Ultraman style characters
5246180	5248160	all fighting in that game.
5248160	5252120	Lastly, trying to peek ahead to see if the Wii or the,
5253280	5255140	that game is coming out on the Wii as well.
5255140	5256600	Let me look at a 3DS real quick.
5256600	5257920	Oh, Mario Kart 7.
5257920	5259760	They get it on December 1st in Japan.
5259760	5262400	So I'm sure we'll be hearing some early reviews
5262400	5263840	from people who imported it.
5263840	5266620	Also Sonic Generations coming out on December 1st as well.
5266620	5269080	Cooking Mama 4 this week on the 3DS.
5269080	5271640	And lastly, but not leastly,
5271640	5272920	get a load of this title.
5272920	5277920	Crayon Shin-chan Uchu de Achuu Yuzhou no Oba Karate.
5278680	5281960	Crayon Shin-chan is old school manga and anime.
5281960	5284380	Yeah. So, and it's, I love,
5284380	5285800	what was the last part of that?
5285800	5287240	I love this.
5287240	5288520	No, Oba Karate.
5288520	5290780	It makes it sound like it's like a karate crayon game.
5290780	5292120	And it is an action-based game.
5292120	5294000	And it's based on that old anime.
5294000	5295720	Kind of like a platformer.
5295720	5296720	Looks a little bit like, you know,
5296720	5299720	your Rayman kind of platformer game.
5299720	5303200	So that's it for releases in Japan.
5305440	5308120	For the UK, really not a whole bunch.
5308120	5313120	We have, on the 30th, Darkstalkers for PlayStation 3.
5314560	5315840	Which is kind of cool.
5315840	5319440	And then on December 1st, there's Infinity Blade 2.
5319440	5323040	December 2nd, Ace Combat, Assault Horizon Legacy,
5323040	5325360	Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC,
5325360	5329320	Mario Kart 7, and Super Pokemon Rumble.
5329320	5330160	That's it.
5331060	5332480	Just a few more stories for you guys,
5332480	5334360	and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
5334360	5335920	But first, Dark Sakura.
5335920	5339320	Well, there have been a lot of pre-orders
5339320	5341080	for the Vita in Hong Kong.
5341960	5345320	Basically, they are the second city
5345320	5349800	that are getting the system.
5349800	5353220	And, well, there's mobbing in online stores
5353220	5356360	that can't, you know, meet the traffic,
5356360	5360920	and lots of stuff going on.
5360920	5362880	But it's, I guess, not nearly as bad
5362880	5364120	as getting pepper sprayed in the face
5364120	5367200	over a $2 waffle iron.
5367200	5369920	But, hey, what this basically means
5369920	5371800	is that the early demand is there.
5371800	5374120	This could be kind of a big deal.
5374120	5374960	Yarp.
5375840	5377600	It could very well be.
5377600	5379520	And I guess that's really all we can say about it for now.
5379520	5381280	I know, I was like,
5381280	5384200	I haven't had any real reaction out of it,
5384200	5385100	just that it's sold.
5385100	5386260	Maybe people are just too busy
5386260	5387760	hiding under their desk playing it.
5387760	5390260	It's interesting to know if the system's gonna do well,
5390260	5393120	or if it's gonna fall flat, so we'll see.
5393120	5394800	All right, well, hopefully.
5395960	5397000	All right.
5397000	5398800	I have high hopes for it.
5398800	5400600	Seems to be doing pretty well.
5400600	5402480	Yeah, I'm definitely gonna get one.
5402480	5403660	So, Loki.
5404600	5408800	So, there's been a lot of talk of piracy this week,
5408800	5412100	and one person, of course, to speak out about it
5412100	5416360	is Gabe Newell, the head of Valve.
5416360	5420080	And basically, one of the things he says
5420080	5422800	is piracy's almost always a service problem,
5422800	5425560	and not a pricing problem.
5425560	5427640	And the way he puts it,
5427640	5431620	it's we think there's a fundamental misconception
5431620	5432460	about piracy.
5432460	5435560	Piracy is always a service problem, not a pricing problem.
5435560	5437880	For example, if a pirate offers a product
5437880	5440040	anywhere in the world, 24-7,
5440040	5443320	purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer,
5443320	5445280	and the legal provider says that the product
5445280	5447660	is region locked, will come to your country
5447660	5449640	three months after a US release,
5449640	5452480	and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store,
5452480	5454120	then the pirate service is more valuable.
5454120	5457300	Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product
5457300	5459880	by either directly restricting a customer's use,
5459880	5462160	or by creating uncertainty.
5462160	5466040	So, basically, kind of alluding to Assassin's Creed 2
5466040	5470880	and the Ubisoft DRM, which we mentioned earlier,
5470880	5475440	pretty much got destroyed in a few days.
5475440	5477840	And then, of course, they're saying,
5477840	5480940	Steam isn't without its own problems.
5480940	5483840	Saints Row the Third, you know,
5483840	5485980	used, I guess, Steamworks and stuff,
5485980	5488440	and is unavailable on the UK Steam store
5488440	5491560	for reasons that THQ are yet to elaborate on.
5491560	5494120	So that kind of sucks that they don't have it yet.
5496080	5498800	But, I mean, Steam's not perfect either,
5498800	5501300	because their stuff gets pirated just as well.
5502560	5503400	I was gonna-
5503400	5505040	A lot of people seem to kind of be on board with Steam.
5505040	5505880	Yeah.
5505880	5506700	Sales help.
5506700	5508400	I was gonna elaborate real quick,
5508400	5512120	because it's not one of the stories that we had earlier,
5512120	5517120	but some other people were talking piracy,
5517400	5519440	and, funny enough, it's also Ubisoft,
5519440	5522520	and their latest game to be coming out,
5522520	5526960	well, ever delayed game to be coming out, I Am Alive,
5529880	5532920	they were saying that, well, we're not gonna put it on PC,
5532920	5535880	because piracy issues.
5535880	5540880	Basically, the creative director, Stanislaus Metra,
5541120	5544040	has basically said that PC piracy
5544040	5547800	makes the financial viability of a game
5547800	5549600	on the platform uncertain,
5549600	5553080	and Ubisoft's previously announced title, I guess,
5553080	5554840	is only planned for consoles,
5554840	5556440	and, of course, that would be I Am Alive.
5556440	5561440	So we heard loud and clear that PC gamers
5561460	5564940	are bitching about there being no version for them.
5564940	5566700	Interesting that they used bitching
5566700	5569200	in their official statement.
5569200	5573440	Says, but are these people just making noise
5573440	5574960	because there's no version,
5574960	5579960	or because it's a game they actually want to play?
5580600	5582320	Would they buy it if we made it?
5582320	5586720	And he continued saying that if 50,000 PC players
5586720	5589620	buy the game, it's not worth the cost
5589620	5592680	of putting a team of 12 on the project for three months.
5592680	5597680	Says it's hard because there's so much piracy
5597680	5600760	and so few people are playing PC games
5600760	5604340	that we have to precisely weigh it up
5604340	5606280	against the cost of making it.
5606280	5609960	Of course, that pissed off everybody, all sorts of people.
5611400	5614440	What's great, though, is shortly afterwards,
5614440	5617760	after everyone completely complained about that,
5617760	5622760	he backpedaled on that, and he's saying, let's see here,
5625320	5629560	honestly, which game maker would not love to see his game
5629560	5631840	to be playable on his main platforms
5631840	5634200	and as by many people as possible?
5637240	5639080	I don't know, it's hilarious.
5641400	5644560	I hate to say it, but I kind of think dude has a point.
5644560	5648200	I mean, a lot of games do get pirated on PC
5648200	5650920	and I think it's part of the reason
5650920	5653600	why developers are getting shy about it.
5653600	5658200	And for example, Arkham City was hella delayed on PC.
5658200	5660700	I bet, and even though the company's not very vocal
5660700	5662040	about this and for good reason,
5662040	5663400	obviously you see all this backlash,
5663400	5667800	I honestly truly believe a big part of the delay for PC
5667800	5669800	was so that consoles got the jump
5669800	5671440	because it's all about playing it,
5671440	5673040	and this goes back to Gabe Newell's point
5673040	5676240	about convenience and getting it as soon as possible
5676240	5677680	and the releases and all that.
5677680	5679480	People wanna play it now.
5679480	5681960	And I think because it's on the consoles early,
5681960	5683360	I think it really helps.
5683360	5686000	I mean, nothing's ever gonna stop piracy,
5686000	5688760	but I think it helps turn a lot of people away from it.
5689920	5691880	I mean, certainly piracy happens on the consoles too,
5691880	5692760	but it's a lot harder.
5692760	5697080	And Ubisoft further digs themselves deeper
5697080	5701120	by skipping Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC as well
5701120	5704480	because, piracy, they even said,
5704480	5706640	they're gonna do Ghost Recon Online,
5706640	5709020	and said, when we started Ghost Recon Online,
5709020	5712380	we were thinking about Ghost Recon Future Soldier
5712380	5714520	having something imported in the classic way
5714520	5716280	without any deep development
5716280	5718640	because we know that 95% of our consumers
5718640	5719520	will pirate the game.
5719520	5722680	So we said, okay, we'll have to change our mind.
5722680	5725880	Well, that's very positive that your game,
5725880	5728280	you feel it's just gonna be pirated like crazy.
5728280	5733280	And they're basically saying that there's no,
5733580	5735520	we're giving away most of the content for free
5735520	5737580	because there's no barrier to entry.
5737580	5740920	And this is talking about Ghost Recon Online.
5740920	5743820	And it says, to the users that are traditionally
5743820	5747540	playing the game by getting it through Pirate Bay,
5747540	5749920	we said, okay, go ahead, guys.
5749920	5752080	This is what you're asking for.
5752080	5753280	We've listened to you.
5753280	5754700	We're gonna give you this experience.
5754700	5755700	It's easy to download.
5755700	5758260	There's no DRM that will pollute your experience.
5758260	5759500	So basically, they're like,
5759500	5760900	well, there's nothing we can do,
5760900	5761740	so we're just gonna stop.
5761740	5763540	So we've designed a free-to-play game.
5763540	5764620	Yeah.
5764620	5765820	Interesting tactic.
5765820	5769440	You know, as much as I think people wanna hate this guy,
5769440	5773560	I think it's somewhat of a fair response.
5773560	5775260	I really do.
5775260	5776100	Yeah.
5776100	5778820	I mean, that is, but I am sorry.
5778820	5780380	I am alive, though.
5781540	5782720	First off, it's running and older.
5782720	5784260	It's not like they have to create the engine
5784260	5785180	totally from scratch.
5785180	5787180	It's the Splinter Cell Conviction Engine.
5787180	5789660	But, and it's also a game that's been delayed
5789660	5790620	and delayed and delayed,
5790620	5792340	and I don't think it's a game that really
5792340	5795600	a lot of people are like, oh my God, I gotta play this.
5795600	5797800	I think they're just pissed off that they're saying,
5797800	5800140	oh, well, no one plays PC games.
5800140	5803020	I think there's a lot of people who disagree with you.
5803020	5804440	All right, I'm going to our chat room
5804440	5805820	for some comments on some various stories
5805820	5806660	we've been talking about,
5806660	5807980	because obviously, we are the show
5807980	5809740	where every gamer has a voice.
5809740	5810580	Usually our...
5810580	5811400	Except everyone.
5811400	5813620	Usually our chat room is at chat.orangelandraday.com,
5813620	5815100	but due to website issues tonight,
5815100	5816720	we are giving you the long way of getting there,
5816720	5819100	which is going on to IRC, the Game Surge Network,
5819100	5820720	and we are at Channel Orange Lounge.
5820720	5821740	Or you know what, for real,
5821740	5822780	if you really don't know how to get there,
5822780	5825620	just go to chat.allgames.com and ask them,
5825620	5826700	how do I join Orange Lounge?
5826700	5827520	They'll tell you.
5827520	5828980	They're nice.
5828980	5829800	Especially tonight.
5829800	5831060	I told them, I said, please be nice,
5831060	5832680	because we don't have a website.
5832680	5834200	Anyhow, just some clarifications.
5834200	5835580	Ever17.
5835580	5836420	Rama figured it out.
5836420	5837540	It's not an anime.
5837540	5840420	It's a visual novel that's now been adapted to a game.
5840420	5842660	So that's what Ever17 is.
5842660	5843580	Let's see.
5843580	5846860	Kajudo is talking about the Vita in Hong Kong,
5846860	5849420	saying they're buying the Vita in Hong Kong
5849420	5850700	so they can resell it.
5850700	5852420	That's the only reason.
5852420	5854780	Interesting perspective, because you might say,
5854780	5855700	oh no, that can't be it,
5855700	5857940	but that kind of shit happens in America, too.
5857940	5859660	Like, you know, when the Wiis first came out,
5859660	5861180	and hell, the Xboxes.
5861180	5862740	Remember when people were buying up
5862740	5864540	the limited Xbox supplies
5864540	5866500	and then reselling them for twice as much?
5866500	5868760	This shit happens with new tech all the time.
5868760	5871220	So I could believe that.
5871220	5873140	I can actually really believe that.
5873140	5873980	So we'll see.
5873980	5876280	I guess that isn't necessarily an indicator
5876280	5877700	of how strong something's gonna sell,
5877700	5880300	because people tried to do that with the 3DS,
5880300	5882020	and it didn't work so well for them.
5882020	5883340	I don't think they made money on that.
5883340	5885580	So there you go.
5885580	5888720	Kajudo in chat says there is only one way to stop piracy,
5888720	5890080	make everything free.
5891100	5892940	Yes, Kajudo, I need you to make me a sandwich,
5892940	5894980	and don't you expect me to pay you for it?
5896260	5897100	Just teasing.
5898540	5900760	But he does go on to say it will never happen.
5900760	5902600	Piracy will never,
5902600	5903580	it will never happen.
5903580	5906340	No one will, nowhere will piracy ever stop.
5906340	5910560	So please stop torturing us with your shitty attempts at DRM.
5913380	5914700	All right.
5914700	5915660	Let's move on.
5916860	5919440	Let's move on with one more story from me.
5919440	5921140	Then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
5921140	5922620	This is something we found
5922620	5924100	when we tried to put together tonight's show
5924100	5925360	without a website.
5925360	5926760	We found this one quickly.
5926760	5929700	It was something we found on Dig,
5929700	5933920	and it's a blog post from a website,
5933920	5935780	damnlag.com,
5935780	5938260	and it's an article about game developers,
5938260	5941460	you need to take your demos more seriously.
5941460	5943480	And of course, now that I'm trying to bring it up in studio,
5943480	5944320	it's not loading,
5944320	5947860	the joys of live radio and internet timeouts.
5948740	5951300	I did read the article a little bit before the show.
5952580	5954300	I think an ad is trying to prevent this thing
5954300	5956620	from popping up all the way or something.
5956620	5958020	Yeah, the internet's working.
5958020	5960820	Yeah, I know, no, the internet's working fine.
5960820	5961740	Amazing.
5963420	5964340	Damn people.
5967220	5969580	So apparently this demo,
5969580	5971900	he's talking about the Rayman Origins demo
5971900	5974140	had recently, I was working for you, fantastic.
5974140	5975740	It's not coming up on the computer over there.
5975740	5976580	All right.
5976580	5979260	So it's talking about how the Rayman Origins demo
5979260	5980500	was really good,
5980500	5984620	and the author of the article at damnlag.com
5984620	5986340	was talking about how he's played through the demo
5986340	5989300	several times and how it's just a great game.
5989300	5992100	It kind of has elements of New Super Mario Brothers Wii,
5992100	5995260	and mixing with the original Rayman and so forth.
5995260	5997860	Saying that, I didn't really know about this game before.
5997860	6000160	Sure, I heard a little bit about it at E3,
6000160	6002580	but I'm kind of throwing this in there.
6002580	6005260	Let's face it, it's a really crowded time of year.
6005260	6006780	There's a lot of video games out right now.
6006780	6009100	It's really kind of hard to get the attention.
6009100	6010540	And the article talks about how developers
6010540	6012900	usually think of demos as an afterthought,
6012900	6016420	that if they even bother to put one out at all.
6016420	6019540	And then talks about, the article goes on to talk about
6019540	6024540	how if you can get a customer to really experience the game
6024980	6027880	or even a demo that's mid-game,
6027880	6029300	citing like Heavenly Sword,
6029300	6030340	something that kind of takes
6030340	6031380	not just the beginning of the game,
6031380	6034060	but something that's a little bit in the middle of the game,
6034060	6035140	that's a really good demo.
6035140	6038700	And then some companies actually do levels
6038700	6040740	that are just for demos.
6040740	6045740	Like DMA Design actually did something in the 90s
6046020	6047620	where they did Lemmings demos
6047620	6050700	that were like Christmas-themed levels, but free.
6050700	6053220	So whatever happened to a good old-fashioned demo?
6053220	6055100	Because a lot of games don't even bother with them.
6055100	6057060	PEGL Extreme, I mean, if you want to look at that,
6057060	6060660	that came out with all of the Valve branding on it.
6060660	6062940	But it was, in essence, a free demo,
6062940	6065500	because it says, hey, if you really liked playing this,
6065500	6069780	and you get, I think like 10 levels or so of PEGL,
6069780	6071500	it says, hey, if you like this,
6071500	6073760	try out the real thing, here you go.
6075120	6077420	So PopCap did it.
6078500	6081200	Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story
6081200	6082780	a little bit is I kind of wanted to ask you guys,
6082780	6084820	how important is a demo for you guys
6084820	6087140	in influencing your game buying decisions?
6087140	6089200	I mean, do you like to use reviews?
6089200	6091540	Do you just kind of jump in if it's cheap?
6091540	6093820	Do you use game demos or what?
6093820	6097980	I'll kind of answer this, is that I do like game demos.
6097980	6100660	I don't think they're necessarily the most important thing
6100660	6102860	in selling a game, because I think,
6102860	6104580	especially now that we live in a day and age
6104580	6109280	where we have Gamefly and hell, even now streaming games,
6109280	6112100	thanks to OnLive and so forth,
6112100	6113620	OnLive especially is interesting,
6113620	6115420	because now your demo can just be,
6115420	6117300	oh, play an hour of it for free,
6117300	6118520	or something like what Steam did
6118520	6120060	over the weekend with Magica.
6120060	6123580	So I think there's a lot of that evolving,
6123580	6126380	but I'm not gonna lie, a really good demo
6126380	6128620	can absolutely sell a game, absolutely,
6128620	6131220	because it leaves you wanting more, you know?
6131220	6134380	Well, on top of that, you also get an idea of edits
6134380	6136660	that they've made in games too,
6136660	6138520	because a lot of times a demo's not gonna have
6138520	6141040	all the edits that make it into the final game.
6141040	6145380	And if you are clever and can get into the information
6145380	6148380	on the disk, you can get more out of it, you know?
6148380	6151260	But I mean, we've got a pile of PlayStation Magazine demos
6151260	6152580	in Devault.
6152580	6154620	Oh yeah, those PlayStation demos are always the bomb.
6154620	6155460	Those are great.
6155460	6157260	I've played so much Jumping Flash.
6158460	6160300	From the demo disk that came
6160300	6162720	with my friend's ex-boyfriend's PlayStation.
6162720	6164860	Well, how many people bought, what was it,
6164860	6166720	like Brave Fencer Mushashi or whatever,
6166720	6168620	just because it came with the Final Fantasy VIII demo?
6168620	6169460	Yes.
6169460	6173820	Or there was, what game got the Final Fantasy VII demo?
6173820	6174700	Can't remember.
6176320	6177260	Toe Ball.
6177260	6178180	Toe Ball.
6178180	6179020	Yeah.
6179020	6180340	Yeah, and that sold a lot just because of the demo too.
6180340	6181880	But Toe Ball actually wasn't a bad game.
6181880	6183720	Yeah, yeah, no, I know, but there's a lot of people.
6183720	6184980	Really wish they'd make a new Toe Ball.
6184980	6185860	They did a second one.
6185860	6187540	Well, I know they did a second one, it was awesome,
6187540	6191360	but I really wish they'd make a new Toe Ball.
6191360	6194000	Going to the chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com,
6194000	6197020	Act Def says, I usually ask people.
6197020	6199340	JV Mon says, I use demos for franchises
6199340	6200260	I'm not familiar with.
6200260	6201540	If it wasn't for demos,
6201540	6205340	I would never have bought Blue Dragon or Cold Seps Saga.
6205340	6207060	Cold Seps Saga is awesome.
6207060	6208580	Cold Seps Saga is an interesting one
6208580	6210220	because I didn't play the demo for that,
6210220	6212260	but a friend of mine got me into that
6212260	6213460	and was like, this is the best game ever
6213460	6214420	and nobody's ever heard of it.
6214420	6215260	And it's true.
6215260	6216660	Like I've never heard anything about that game,
6216660	6219420	but it's like fricking Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
6219420	6221220	It was actually kind of awesome.
6221220	6223880	Kaijuto says, demo made me buy Just Cause 2.
6223880	6225200	I love that game.
6225200	6229640	Hitstun goes so far as to make a little graph here.
6229640	6232500	My usual considerations when buying games.
6232500	6235460	Friends playing, greater than reviews,
6235460	6240000	greater than price, greater than hype, greater than demo.
6240000	6242960	So kind of putting demo towards the end of the chain there.
6242960	6245220	See, I honestly,
6245220	6248500	because my friends have kind of different tastes
6248500	6249880	all across the board.
6249880	6251780	So one person may like something
6251780	6254060	and I've turned out to completely hate it.
6254060	6256100	I mean, because it's just how it is.
6256100	6259180	I don't believe in making a judgment
6259180	6262800	until I've played some of it, you know, or seen it played.
6262800	6267620	So demos and, you know, online videos of a game
6267620	6271140	really do more for me
6271140	6273440	than relying on another person's opinion,
6273440	6274300	if that makes sense.
6274300	6277260	Not that I disrespect my friends' opinions,
6277260	6279220	but it's just, honestly,
6279220	6280740	there's games that a lot of people love
6280740	6283140	that I'm like, what the hell?
6283140	6284740	Like, to be perfectly honest,
6284740	6286960	I'm kind of not all that into Skyrim.
6288400	6290440	I don't care about Diablo 3 coming out.
6291460	6293300	I mean, I really don't care.
6293300	6295220	I really didn't care about Star Wars that much
6295220	6297620	other than I'm missing something free.
6297620	6302620	I mean, you know what I like.
6302700	6304740	I go for quirky and weird.
6304740	6307300	So just because another person says they like it
6307300	6308200	or one of my friends is playing,
6308200	6310300	it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm gonna like it.
6310300	6311860	I'd have to give it a try first.
6313140	6316100	All right, but then Technus kind of gives us
6316100	6317500	our final thought on this story here.
6317500	6321360	I think not enough companies make demos for their games.
6321360	6324160	It is a lot of work, though, to turn out a demo, I mean.
6324160	6328940	But yeah, I think people discover games
6328940	6329780	in many different ways,
6329780	6331280	and a good demo is certainly one of them.
6331280	6334120	But a bad demo can really damn your game.
6334120	6336360	You know, one other thing, I guess I wanna open this,
6336360	6338240	because I'm not so sure the article
6338240	6339440	got into talking about this,
6339440	6343140	but I think when it comes to the Xbox Live arcade games
6343140	6344440	or PlayStation Network games,
6344440	6346920	those demos can really make or break the damn game.
6346920	6349120	I really do make my decisions based off those demos.
6349120	6351240	I play those demos a lot, I really do.
6351240	6356240	And I think those demos are really important,
6356560	6358740	because especially when it's so easy,
6358740	6362320	just press X to upgrade, you know what I mean?
6362320	6365280	How easy is that if you really enjoy a demo?
6365280	6368320	Anyhow, we're gonna now take a moment
6368320	6370420	to dive into gaming history.
6370420	6373660	With the classic Game of the Week segment.
6373660	6375840	No demo needed here, you play it
6375840	6377720	because Dark Soccer has said so.
6377720	6380100	It's the classic Game of the Week.
6380100	6381480	Very interesting choice this week.
6381480	6382520	I hope that you picked the music
6382520	6384760	from the first one on the list.
6384760	6386720	There was no list this week, Dark Soccer,
6386720	6387680	because of the website.
6387680	6389080	But I told you what the game was.
6389080	6393060	You did, so hopefully this is the right one, we'll see.
6393060	6393900	Just play.
6395560	6398960	Okay, so the Game of the Week is called Three Wonders,
6398960	6401760	or as it was in Japan, Wonder Three.
6401760	6404800	And it's an arcade game that was made by Capcom in 1991
6404800	6408280	in a CPS1 game, and you can choose three games in it.
6408280	6410720	You have Midnight Wanderers, Quest for the Chariot,
6410720	6412880	which in Japan is called Roosters,
6412880	6417880	and it has a hobbit named Lu and Shiva in it,
6417920	6419480	which I wanna still say Shiva,
6419480	6421480	because that's how it would have been pronounced
6421480	6423280	in the Japanese version.
6423280	6425040	Then there's Chariot, and then Trick through the Sky,
6425040	6427520	which is also just called Chariot in Japan.
6427520	6429280	And then Don't Pull.
6429280	6432080	Midnight Wanderers is a platform game,
6432080	6433880	and it's actually really, really cool.
6433880	6435800	I've watched Dan play it through a number of times,
6435800	6437960	and I've played it a little bit myself, pretty fun.
6437960	6440440	And then Chariot is a shmup,
6440440	6444240	where you have Lu and Shiva as well.
6444240	6446780	And then Don't Pull is kind of like Pando.
6446780	6451780	It's a pulling puzzle-type game.
6451780	6454320	It came out in 1998 on the Sega Saturn
6454320	6455620	and on the PlayStation.
6455620	6457840	And then Capcom re-released it in 2006
6457840	6462240	on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 on PS2 and Xbox,
6462240	6466400	and Capcom Classics Collection Remix 2 on PS3.
6466400	6469440	Really, there's not a whole bunch to say,
6469440	6473160	because they're really simple.
6473160	6474120	They speak for themselves.
6474120	6479120	I mean, I've seen a lot more of Midnight Wanderers
6479360	6481560	than the other two, just because, you know,
6481560	6483360	seeing Dan play through the whole thing is pretty fun.
6483360	6485640	But I think what I like best about that one
6485640	6489120	is I really, really, really love the art style in it.
6489120	6491080	It's really cool.
6491080	6493520	And I like the music in it a lot, too.
6493520	6494520	Hit me, Dan!
6494520	6499520	Get in here and tell us about the game.
6501640	6505560	He said no, he's a butthead.
6505560	6510560	But it really is very bright, vivid colors, very pretty.
6511120	6512840	It's a great game.
6512840	6515800	Lu also made it as an assist character
6515800	6517280	for Marvel versus Capcom.
6518240	6523240	And he basically looked exactly like he did
6523240	6525380	in Midnight Wanderers.
6525380	6526220	And then,
6531900	6534060	Sheeva was actually,
6534060	6537700	well, there was a character based on him for Cannon Spike.
6537700	6541100	It was called Sheeva Shintaro, who was based off of him.
6541100	6542460	But, I mean, that's really it.
6542460	6544620	I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.
6544620	6546620	Everyone should play this game.
6546620	6548180	But really, everyone should just be playing
6548180	6550020	the Midnight Wanderers part of the game.
6550020	6554620	So the classic game of the week is Three Wonders.
6554620	6556900	Or, if you want, it's just Midnight Wanderers, really.
6556900	6559900	Yeah, but I mean, Chariot's not bad.
6559900	6560740	Chariot's not bad.
6560740	6563700	And I don't know, the puzzle game kind of pisses me off.
6563700	6565600	But then again, I suck at Pingo.
6567140	6569460	I like Pingo, so I would actually check out the puzzler.
6569460	6571220	That sounds like kind of cool.
6571220	6573420	And if anyone finds a Three Wonders machine,
6573420	6575660	Freakin' take a picture of it for me.
6575660	6577820	Yeah, I've never even heard of this game.
6577820	6579340	I really haven't.
6579340	6580940	And it even runs on, like, Capcom hardware.
6580940	6582300	You'd think this thing would be everywhere, so.
6582300	6584900	Well, you can, I mean, you can run it on May.
6584900	6586820	I'm sure, yeah, emulator, easy, but.
6586820	6590620	Yeah, but it's really neat, but yeah.
6590620	6593180	I think just the star of the collection
6593180	6594540	is Midnight Wanderers.
6594540	6595380	All right, there you go.
6595380	6598860	Your classic game of the week, Three Wonders in the arcade.
6598860	6600420	Never on a console, right?
6600420	6602380	I just said it came out on consoles.
6602380	6604260	Sorry, I was trying to deal with another issue.
6604260	6606900	It came out in 1998 on the Saturn and PlayStation.
6606900	6607740	Oh, nice, okay.
6607740	6611260	And then we got re-releases in 2006
6611260	6612900	for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox,
6612900	6615420	which was the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2.
6615420	6619460	And then the PSP is Capcom Classics Collection remixed.
6620380	6621220	All right, very cool.
6621220	6625340	Very, very awesome thing to have.
6625340	6626180	All right.
6626180	6628860	Well, we're gonna take a break here at Orange Launch Radio,
6628860	6630020	but don't go anywhere, guys.
6630020	6633540	We'll be right back with part B of our show,
6633540	6634820	which might be a little bit shorter,
6634820	6636660	but that just means more time for calls
6636660	6640860	and, and coming up tonight, a list-list.
6640860	6642100	And we'll tell you guys the topic
6642100	6643580	when we come back in a little bit
6643580	6646900	with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6646900	6651060	["Orange Lounge Radio Theme Song"]
6652340	6655060	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio
6655060	6656660	for the second half of our show,
6656660	6661160	live on November the 27th of 2011 at All Games Radio.
6661160	6663620	Yes, our website's busted right now.
6663620	6665540	If you try to visit it at OrangeLaunchRadio.com,
6665540	6667780	you get a message that implies we haven't paid a bill,
6667780	6669540	but trust me, if it was that easy to fix,
6669540	6671980	we would've done it for the show.
6671980	6674620	Keep in mind, our website is graciously donated,
6674620	6678460	but you can't complain about free,
6678460	6680880	so we just kinda have to wait for things
6680880	6682600	to work themselves out behind the scenes.
6682600	6685380	So anyhow, moving on, we are still trying to tape a show
6685380	6687000	so that whenever our website does get back up,
6687000	6688140	we can podcast it.
6688140	6689940	And we're having fun with our live listeners
6689940	6691100	who are in our chat room.
6691100	6693180	You still can't get to our chat room,
6693180	6695260	even without chat.orangelaunchradio.com,
6695260	6696220	which you can do.
6696220	6700220	You can go to any IRC client,
6700220	6703540	look up Gamesurge, which is the IRC.gamesurge.net,
6703540	6705600	and join Channel Orange Lounge.
6705600	6708340	You can also do that through the All Games chat client.
6708340	6710980	So if you just go over to chat.allgames.com,
6710980	6712400	if you really want something online,
6712400	6715500	just join Channel Orange Lounge from there.
6715500	6716500	That's really easy.
6716500	6718480	We will be taking your phone calls a little later on,
6718480	6719320	and so forth.
6719320	6720380	We also have a list list coming up,
6720380	6721760	and we'll get to that very, very soon.
6721760	6725380	I hope everybody in studio has their list together.
6725380	6727180	We'll be taking your votes on that soon.
6727180	6728860	And you do have to be in our chat room
6728860	6730240	if you want to participate with that.
6730240	6733240	And no mailbag tonight, sadly.
6733240	6735300	We can't get to the emails, don't.
6735300	6737540	But we will be getting to your tweets.
6737540	6739120	So get your tweets in.
6739120	6740580	If you haven't already sent those in,
6740580	6743860	twitter.com slash O-L-R.
6743860	6745980	No rapid fire news tonight.
6745980	6748320	We're just gonna get back right into some longer news.
6748320	6749960	We'll start with, oh, I wanted to,
6749960	6752900	actually, I did want to talk about this quickly.
6752900	6756600	We talked about Black Friday stuff a little bit already,
6756600	6758180	and just some of the craziness
6758180	6759980	that was going on out there.
6759980	6762460	One of the stories that I had actually grabbed
6762460	6765380	was about folks that were actually pepper sprayed
6765380	6768100	in the face and slammed and all this stuff.
6768100	6769380	I think a lot of you guys heard about this.
6769380	6770660	I'm sure it was all over the news.
6770660	6772320	Some chick that was trying to get an Xbox
6772320	6774980	actually pepper sprayed people trying to get to it.
6774980	6778100	So people just getting crazy out there.
6778100	6780900	I have zero desire to participate
6780900	6782580	in any of this type of Black Friday antics,
6782580	6786020	but I noticed that I was leaving a Thanksgiving dinner
6786020	6787740	in the Bay Area at about 1130,
6787740	6790140	and I had to drive, my friend that lives there
6790140	6793360	lives right by that Fry's in Fremont.
6793360	6795140	Or maybe it's actually Milpitas at that point.
6795140	6795980	Yeah, Milpitas.
6795980	6798380	Yeah, so I had to literally drive right by that.
6798380	6800460	And yeah, parking lot was a madhouse,
6800460	6802380	and there was already a line at 1130.
6802380	6803740	You know, and it just, I was like,
6803740	6805180	I do not want to be anywhere near here.
6805180	6806540	And it's funny because you have Fry's
6806540	6807860	on the left side of the road,
6807860	6810460	and then Walmart on the right side of the road.
6810460	6812620	And so like all the cars in the left turn lane
6812620	6814240	were backed up and all the cars in the right turn lane
6814240	6815080	were backed up.
6815080	6816660	The only clear lane was the middle.
6816660	6818220	You could zoom right down through the middle
6818220	6820180	and get back on the freeway, which is right there.
6820180	6823980	So it's just, I for one would never be out
6823980	6825060	in this kind of madness, but.
6825060	6826060	I didn't leave the house.
6826060	6827340	No, I don't blame you.
6827340	6828780	You know how some of the local Fry's,
6828780	6831340	they have like themes to them and stuff.
6831340	6832600	Like the one we have in Roseville
6832600	6834860	is like railroad and stuff.
6834860	6837300	The theme for the Fry's I'd given Milpitas
6837300	6839180	is like black market.
6839180	6842300	It's just cages and components.
6842300	6844620	That's it, old school.
6844620	6846620	It's like a science lab in there or something.
6846620	6848380	Yeah, so yeah.
6848380	6851180	I am much more of a fan of Cyber Monday,
6851180	6852300	which is coming up tomorrow.
6852300	6854420	And I guess some of the sales are out there already.
6854420	6856220	Wait till they figure out how to pepper spray you
6856220	6857220	through the computer.
6860140	6861260	There's always that tumbler.
6861260	6862820	You can see that pepper spray guy,
6862820	6864020	Oliver was pepper spray cop,
6864020	6865780	pepper spraying cop, that tumbler.
6865780	6867980	Also, I wanna mention this,
6867980	6869500	another great way to save money
6869500	6872740	is through the sales online through services like Steam,
6872740	6875300	who just had a pretty awesome sale, I gotta say.
6875300	6878540	Portal 2 was $10 on Wednesday.
6878540	6881820	Civilization 5 was $10 yesterday.
6881820	6883100	They've been having some really good sales.
6883100	6884620	I don't know if you guys have picked anything up.
6884620	6886340	I actually didn't, I gotta admit,
6886340	6887740	a lot of the games that were on sale
6887740	6888580	that I would have bought,
6888580	6890900	I already bought at full price earlier.
6890900	6892380	So I didn't really indulge in the sale,
6892380	6893860	except I did buy some DLC.
6893860	6895860	I bought some Civ 5 DLC
6895860	6897940	that I hadn't picked up before during the sale.
6897940	6899780	Did you guys do,
6899780	6902740	did you guys purchase anything through these sales?
6902740	6903580	Nope.
6903580	6904540	No?
6904540	6905380	No?
6905380	6906300	Oh.
6906300	6907660	And what about you guys in our chatroom
6907660	6908700	at chat.ownerswesterly.com?
6908700	6911820	You know, I tried to poll the people on our Google+,
6911820	6912900	our new Google Plus page,
6912900	6914320	and I kinda got a very similar response,
6914320	6916900	where it's like, nah, didn't wanna be out fighting in it.
6916900	6918500	I had a better time just kinda pointing
6918500	6919340	and laughing at people.
6919340	6921720	I've learned my lesson from going
6921720	6923220	to some Black Friday stuff.
6923220	6925700	Not necessarily lining up at like midnight or something,
6925700	6928100	but just going there during the day.
6928100	6930740	And I remember the last time I actually went out,
6930740	6931920	well there was two times,
6931920	6932920	there was one where I went out
6932920	6935860	cause I actually needed some DVD-Rs,
6935860	6937460	and so I went to Best Buy.
6937460	6938740	It wasn't actually that bad.
6938740	6939660	There was no one,
6939660	6941860	I mean it was just like in normal Saturday traffic.
6941860	6943260	I think as long as you're not there
6943260	6947380	like an hour or two before or after opening, it's fine.
6947380	6948900	Yeah, so that was that.
6948900	6952300	And then I went to Fry's one time,
6952300	6953980	cause I was looking for something,
6953980	6955220	I don't remember exactly what now,
6955220	6957000	but Fry's was terrible.
6957000	6960580	And it was like in the afternoon on Black Friday,
6960580	6965260	and the line was just like an hour and a half long
6965260	6967180	for whatever.
6967180	6970220	And I mean, that's bad when they have
6970220	6972460	like 30 registers open or something,
6972460	6974800	but and that line is still that long.
6976160	6977220	It was really bad.
6977220	6980140	And they had a guy walking around the balloon,
6980140	6983580	a giant like weather balloon that says line ends here,
6983580	6984900	and he's basically,
6984900	6987960	this line just snakes through the entire store.
6987960	6989300	It was ridiculous.
6989300	6990140	Crazy.
6990140	6992180	But yeah, I don't really like doing that stuff,
6992180	6994180	and even like the recent games I've got,
6994180	6995540	I actually have Call of Duty,
6995540	6999060	Modern Warfare 3 that I got for free,
6999060	7001300	and Skyrim I got for free,
7001300	7002900	cause every now and then the publisher
7002900	7005180	likes to actually send us stuff.
7005180	7008520	So I played that,
7008520	7010780	but I'm not going to buy any new stuff.
7010780	7014260	In fact, actually probably not gonna buy any new games
7014260	7015540	for a long time.
7015540	7017400	I don't really know what the next new game
7017400	7018240	I'd probably get with.
7018240	7019080	I gotta buy Mario Kart.
7019080	7020660	Borderlands 2, but that's about it.
7020660	7022360	I gotta buy Mario Kart.
7022360	7023980	I still have a credit on Amazon though, so.
7023980	7026660	I'm seriously thinking of trading in Modern Warfare 3
7026660	7029740	for like probably,
7029740	7033620	I'd probably lean more towards Super Mario Land 3D
7033620	7034460	than I would.
7034460	7035280	It's great.
7035280	7036120	It's really good.
7036120	7037980	Mario Kart, cause Mario Kart's kinda,
7037980	7040580	it's the same stuff all over again, you know?
7040580	7041420	They don't really,
7041420	7044260	they're like repeating old classic tracks
7044260	7046020	instead of coming up with original stuff
7046020	7047860	and then adding the classic tracks.
7049940	7051660	We got a couple comments in our chat rooms.
7051660	7054500	Evil, or E3VL, which I think he has evil,
7054500	7055500	is in our chat saying,
7055500	7057360	is the Cyber Monday sale separate
7057360	7059540	from the Autumn sale on Steam?
7059540	7062140	I'm not sure if Steam's gonna do something separate
7062140	7062980	on Monday.
7062980	7064060	I wouldn't anticipate it.
7064060	7065220	Well there's also, remember,
7065220	7067260	the Amazon Gold Box sales,
7067260	7068940	which are always really good.
7068940	7072100	Cyber Monday is actually an internet-wide thing.
7072100	7074760	It's kind of the internet's response to Black Friday,
7074760	7077100	because Monday is when everybody goes back to work.
7077100	7078780	And I guess there's this perception
7078780	7080700	that nobody actually works when they go back to work,
7080700	7082660	instead they're online shopping all day.
7082660	7084460	So all these companies do,
7084460	7087080	all these companies do these big online sales on Monday.
7087080	7089780	So it's totally a man-made invented thing,
7089780	7092160	but hey, any excuse for a sale, right?
7092160	7094580	So Steam may get in on it.
7094580	7097820	I know Microsoft is supposed to be doing something.
7097820	7100740	They've been doing some sales on Xbox Live all week.
7100740	7102500	Like you can get things like Bejeweled 3,
7102500	7105420	and God, some game was only like 240,
7105420	7107300	oh, I think it's Bejeweled Blitz or something,
7107300	7109260	it's only like 240 Microsoft points,
7109260	7111320	which is about what it's worth, so.
7112500	7114160	JVMod in our chat room is talking about
7114160	7116020	some of the Black Friday sales he got.
7116020	7118600	I got the $200 PlayStation 3 bundle,
7118600	7121140	the $179.99 3DS bundle,
7121140	7123980	the $199.99 42-inch TV,
7123980	7126260	and a 3004 laptop.
7126260	7127980	I don't know what a 3004 laptop is.
7127980	7129140	I think he mistyped something.
7129140	7131540	The rest of that is, sounds like you,
7131540	7133540	dude, can I have a loan?
7133540	7135100	Probably 300 for a laptop.
7135100	7136540	Oh yeah, maybe that's what it is,
7136540	7137360	300 for a laptop.
7137360	7139440	Oh, $300, maybe shift F4.
7139440	7142240	So that's nice though.
7142240	7143540	That's like your whole electronics
7143540	7145460	for several years taken care of in one day.
7145460	7146820	It's pretty nice.
7146820	7149540	And Technus says, oh, and after working
7149540	7152760	a Black Friday myself, I cannot support it.
7152760	7153940	You know, I got to say,
7153940	7155840	props to you folks in retail,
7155840	7157380	especially those of you on the front lines.
7157380	7160020	I mean, yeah, people pepper spraying
7160020	7161500	in Walmart and shit is madness,
7161500	7163020	but can you imagine having to work
7163020	7164340	that Walmart that night?
7164340	7165400	Oh my God.
7168140	7169660	You poor people.
7169660	7171240	There's a very big reason why
7171240	7173560	I never want to do retail again.
7173560	7176300	That's, it's all summed up in one day right there.
7176300	7177660	All right, let's move on with some gaming news.
7177660	7178480	Logie.
7178480	7181620	Well, just because you've done what,
7181620	7182760	10 of them in a row?
7183680	7185360	Dan called us all blisses.
7185360	7187780	Uh, yeah.
7187780	7191820	I got a funny story, actually,
7191820	7194060	about this story that I'm gonna talk about.
7194060	7195640	First off, let's talk about this.
7195640	7197280	Ridge Racer Vita.
7197280	7199880	We were talking about why people pirate stuff.
7199880	7201600	This is pretty bad.
7201600	7204420	Ridge Racer Vita, it only includes
7204420	7206980	three courses and five cars.
7206980	7208720	It sounds almost like a demo to me.
7209720	7213560	Apparently, according to the Japanese press sampling
7213560	7215820	of Ridge Racer, they're surprised to find
7215820	7219700	that the game only has a few tracks and a few cars.
7219700	7222740	They said, of course, there will be download content,
7222740	7227200	but it's just weird that there's so little material.
7227200	7231440	Also, apparently, I guess there's also supposed
7231440	7232900	to be this planetary league as well,
7232900	7236300	which is a new mode that sounds kinda neat.
7236300	7238860	Planetary league, I guess Namco is,
7238860	7240860	they're gonna be sending out team battle missions
7240860	7244180	for multiplayer, plus it's also playable over Wi-Fi
7244180	7248420	and ad hoc and all sorts of stuff,
7248420	7249660	and you can share ghost data,
7249660	7254660	but three tracks and five cars, really?
7255420	7257460	I mean, and on top of that.
7257460	7259400	Because you know it's gonna be DLC.
7259400	7261900	And on top of that, okay, the game is supposed
7261900	7265780	to be slightly cheaper than most of the Vita games,
7265780	7267500	but 40 bucks instead of 50.
7267500	7269220	Exactly, exactly.
7269220	7270300	Boo hiss.
7270300	7272980	If this is true, if this is true,
7272980	7275300	then fuck this game for real.
7275300	7277420	And it only runs at 30 frames per second
7277420	7279140	instead of 60 frames per second.
7279140	7282600	And here's, I had a dream last night about this.
7282600	7285740	I seriously, for some reason, and I don't even know why,
7285740	7286860	because I read this earlier in the week,
7286860	7289300	some reason I just had a dream about this,
7289300	7293540	and I remember I was talking to some guy
7293540	7297180	who apparently, in the dream, was representative
7297180	7300020	of the person responsible for this game,
7300020	7301660	and my response was this.
7301660	7303640	What the fuck were you thinking?
7303640	7305100	I mean, really, seriously?
7305100	7307860	Three fucking tracks and five cars?
7307860	7309820	No one's gonna fucking buy this game.
7309820	7311900	I don't give a shit if it's Ridge Racer.
7311900	7313340	This is ridiculous.
7313340	7315260	It's Ridge Racer.
7315260	7316540	The rest of the letters are available
7316540	7319100	in a $3.99 download content bundle pack.
7319100	7322940	Not even, you wouldn't even finish Ridge.
7322940	7323900	It'd be rid.
7324780	7325820	That's all you get for this.
7325820	7327580	I mean, three fucking tracks.
7327580	7328420	Here's the thing.
7328420	7330460	It's one thing to just openly reject this game
7330460	7331660	if it does come out for $40.
7331660	7334820	I hope this is just like maybe an early build,
7334820	7338300	like a press build or something, like a demo.
7338300	7341520	Maybe just they're really working to get the full game done
7341520	7343500	and it's just not ready, you know?
7343500	7346300	And it's not gonna be ready until it goes gold.
7346300	7348940	I'm really hoping that's what happens.
7348940	7351460	And soon we'll get this Japanese website that's like,
7351460	7353540	comes with 20 tracks and 20 cars.
7353540	7354380	You know, something like that.
7354380	7356900	Oh, I hope so, because Ridge Racer's pretty awesome.
7356900	7359020	I think for the launch, you know, the 3DS,
7359020	7361740	it was one of the best games that they had available.
7361740	7362580	It was, yeah.
7362580	7365020	Even though there was all rehash stuff, but.
7365020	7368540	But the 3D effects, it was a good 3D show-off game, yeah.
7368540	7370740	But, I mean, seriously.
7370740	7372580	I like Dungeon Buster in our chat room.
7372580	7374340	Ridge rip-off.
7375780	7378540	It is just, and it's funny though,
7378540	7381500	because I actually, I watched, I was reading this
7381500	7382960	and then I watched the trailer.
7382960	7384720	I'm like, hey, you know what?
7384720	7387520	That trailer only shows these three tracks.
7388700	7389680	I wonder.
7390820	7392740	But it's gonna be one thing if the game
7392740	7394420	comes out like this, but it's gonna be just
7394420	7397620	flat out insulting if they add a bunch of tracks
7397620	7398980	as download content.
7398980	7400860	Unless it's all free.
7400860	7402460	If it's free DLC, they won't be.
7402460	7403420	But why would they do that?
7403420	7404260	They won't.
7404260	7405080	No.
7405080	7409240	If, now here's where I would support it.
7409240	7412500	Remember on the PSP, they had Rockband.
7412500	7413780	You can buy Rockband in the game.
7413780	7416680	Then they also had Rockband where you could buy,
7416680	7419600	or download the free demo, and then you pay for songs.
7419600	7421160	Oh yeah, I remember that, yeah, yeah.
7421160	7422000	I'm fine with that.
7422000	7423380	If they wanna do this, like say,
7423380	7425640	put it on the store and like, you know,
7425640	7428600	okay, well, you can buy the game for nothing
7428600	7430840	and it comes with three tracks and five cars
7430840	7433640	and you can buy the rest of the game for DLC.
7433640	7434980	I'm fine with that.
7434980	7436660	Or, you know, you pay 99 cents
7436660	7438640	and you get the rest of this later on.
7439960	7441660	But as a retail game for like,
7441660	7443560	I'm assuming this is gonna be 40 bucks.
7443560	7445440	I have yet to see the setup information for this
7445440	7447020	so I can't confirm on the price yet.
7447020	7448640	Hopefully I'll know that soon.
7448640	7452240	But this is, it's probably gonna be about a $40 game.
7452240	7453700	Well, Namco, one thing you need to do
7453700	7455960	when you get back to work this week after the holiday
7455960	7459160	is you need to clarify, so I guess maybe in Japan
7459160	7460320	they didn't really have the same holiday,
7460320	7462680	but still, come next week at work,
7462680	7466000	they need to clarify what the hell's going on here.
7466000	7468400	What is this game actually gonna have in it?
7468400	7470560	So hopefully next week we can correct that.
7471880	7473040	Anyhow, let's move on.
7474600	7478060	A story has hit computer and video games.com
7478060	7480280	about two possible, as they're calling it,
7480280	7483460	Xbox 720 models that are planned.
7483460	7487340	Apparently there's gonna be a dual SKU strategy expected,
7487340	7489540	along with a significant Kinect upgrade.
7489540	7493320	Long story short, you may or may not remember this,
7493320	7496840	remember the Xbox 360 had two ways you could buy it.
7496840	7499480	They had the, what, the regular, or,
7499480	7500320	what was it called at the time?
7500320	7502040	The core and the premium.
7502040	7504540	And the leader, core and premium, yeah, that's right.
7504540	7509360	And the non, one of them was what, $299, right?
7509360	7511000	And that was no hard drive.
7511000	7512880	$299 for the core, no hard drive.
7512880	7514200	No onboard memory at the time,
7514200	7515480	because this was the first Xbox.
7515480	7516320	No hard drive, nothing.
7516320	7518400	It's just basically the box, that's it.
7518400	7520640	And then there was this elite version
7520640	7522600	that came with a hard drive,
7522600	7527400	and it came with, thank you, a wireless controller
7527400	7528600	instead of a wired one.
7528600	7529960	Yeah, that was the other big difference.
7529960	7532120	And I think a shiny silver door
7532120	7533800	as opposed to a plain white one.
7533800	7534640	Yep.
7534640	7535680	Whoopie doo, right?
7535680	7538740	So apparently that's the road they're going down
7538740	7540760	for whatever this next Xbox is,
7540760	7544600	is that one will be a pared down system
7544600	7547280	to be released as cheaply as possible,
7547280	7550440	positioned more along the lines of a set top box,
7550440	7553440	because 360 as a Netflix viewing device
7553440	7555440	is apparently a huge deal,
7555440	7559240	and perhaps a Kinect themed gaming portal.
7559240	7562300	But then there will be a more fully featured machine
7562300	7565080	with an optical drive, hard disk,
7565080	7568140	and backward compatibility aimed at the hardcore
7568140	7569960	would be released at a higher price point.
7569960	7571800	Listen to that again.
7571800	7573080	There's going to be a vert,
7573080	7574720	maybe if rumors are to be believed,
7574720	7576080	and there's gonna be rumors or anything at this point,
7576080	7579900	but maybe there's gonna be an Xbox with no drive.
7579900	7582660	Dude, I don't buy that there's not gonna be drive in there.
7582660	7584520	Optical drives are so fucking cheap.
7584520	7587720	It's just, why would you do that?
7587720	7590560	I mean, because basically you're forcing people
7590560	7594000	to buy the new product online.
7594000	7596200	That's really the way they wanna go with it, then fine.
7596200	7598000	But really no optical drive?
7598000	7600280	I mean, drive, DVD drives?
7600280	7602520	Okay, let's assume that it's gonna be a Blu-ray drive.
7602520	7606220	Probably drives are not incredibly expensive anymore.
7606220	7608960	I mean, they're not as cheap as DVD drives,
7608960	7610400	that's for sure, but.
7610400	7611760	You can get a Blu-ray player now
7611760	7613640	for what, 80 bucks, 100 bucks?
7613640	7615480	I can't imagine that those drives are that expensive.
7615480	7618200	Those things used to be four or five hundred dollars.
7618200	7620460	Of course, same thing could be said about DVD players.
7620460	7622420	I remember a time when a DVD player was like,
7622420	7624160	that's the thing the rich kids had.
7625680	7627440	I just, I don't know.
7627440	7629120	I mean, hey, whatever, that's fine.
7629120	7630320	They're giving you options,
7630320	7633520	so you don't have to buy the cheap, cheap, cheap one
7633520	7634520	if you really wanna.
7636360	7639600	So obviously a lot of this is still to be unveiled.
7639600	7642720	Another rumor is that Kinect will likely get
7642720	7646560	a significant upgrade and be bundled with the console.
7646560	7647420	That all makes sense.
7647420	7649800	I mean, I think Kinect is something Microsoft's kind of,
7649800	7654800	you know, embedded in their self now.
7655160	7657100	And I think Kinect was supposed to be
7657100	7658380	a higher resolution to begin with.
7658380	7661320	They had to kind of take it down a resolution a little bit
7661320	7664720	to work with the system as it was today.
7664720	7666640	But like, you know, remember we're seeing the patents
7666640	7669000	for like it was gonna read sign language and shit?
7669000	7672060	Like if it had the higher resolution, it could do that.
7672060	7673880	But it'll get better.
7673880	7674720	It'll be interesting.
7674720	7677140	Yeah, the technology will get better, that's for sure.
7677140	7678480	But then here's the other thing.
7678480	7679920	Can I tell you the thing that bothers me most
7679920	7681640	about this story?
7681640	7685720	As that it's called two Xbox 720 models reportedly planned.
7685720	7690560	Okay, seriously, we need to stop calling it the Xbox 720
7690560	7692120	because that is a stupid name.
7692120	7694160	It's not gonna be called the Xbox 720.
7694160	7695400	Why would you call it that?
7695400	7700400	Okay, the Xbox 360 did not come after the Xbox 359, okay?
7701380	7704720	It's not, you know, and I get it 360 times two is 720.
7704720	7706040	But you know what?
7706040	7709200	Something tells me they're gonna just go another direction
7709200	7710680	with the name.
7710680	7713320	As to what direction they're gonna go with the name?
7713320	7717980	Well, we thought we would bring back one of our old friends
7717980	7719320	to help us figure that out.
7719320	7722260	What exactly that name could be.
7722260	7723980	And that is a segment on the show
7723980	7726220	we like to call listless.
7726220	7730780	That's right.
7730780	7735780	Tonight's listless topic is what should we refer
7736100	7737720	to the new Xbox as?
7737720	7739280	What should the new Xbox be called?
7739280	7742020	What should we refer to it as here on the program?
7742020	7744560	Because we're not calling it the Xbox 720 anymore.
7744560	7748220	So what should the new name for the Xbox two
7748220	7749260	or whatever it's gonna be,
7749260	7751240	or I guess it would really be Xbox three,
7751240	7752660	what should it be called?
7752660	7755580	Okay, so if you wanna give us suggestions,
7755580	7758100	you can in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
7758100	7760420	But this is a highly scientific process, people.
7760420	7761500	Here's the way the list works
7761500	7765020	if you've never listened to listless before on the show.
7765020	7767200	We're each gonna go around and give our top three answers.
7767200	7768780	That'll come up with a list of nines.
7768780	7769640	We have no guests tonight.
7769640	7771800	Usually it's a list of 12, not tonight.
7771800	7773080	But then we're each gonna go around
7773080	7775100	and take one off the list.
7775100	7776260	Oh, that's the hard part.
7776260	7778320	That'll leave a list of six,
7778320	7781200	which you guys will go around and vote on your number one
7781200	7782620	and number two answers for.
7782620	7784660	And we're gonna get a definitive answer
7784660	7788940	for what should the new Xbox be called?
7788940	7789780	All right.
7790840	7793260	So chat.orangelandradio.com
7793260	7794180	if you wanna give our suggestion.
7794180	7796980	Excuse me, I forgot that doesn't work tonight.
7796980	7799180	Channel Orange Lounge on IRC Game Surge
7799180	7800900	if you wanna give your suggestions.
7800900	7803060	Let's start building the list.
7803060	7806580	So we will start with, we'll start with Loki tonight.
7806580	7807700	Your number three answer,
7807700	7809580	what should they call the new Xbox?
7809580	7811440	Or what should we refer to it as here on the show?
7811440	7814280	Well, the way they have been changing their naming schemes
7814280	7816340	for things like, especially Windows operating system
7816340	7818260	and stuff before it used to be Windows 95,
7818260	7820100	Vista, and they'd have clunky names.
7820100	7823340	Now it's Windows 7 and they're talking about Windows 8.
7823340	7826440	So I'm just gonna say Microsoft Xbox 3.
7826440	7829120	And when I close my eyes, it's all that I need.
7829120	7831200	Because it's simplified that's,
7831200	7834200	I know it makes no sense, 363, but whatever.
7834200	7836360	So you're just gonna say, just call it the Xbox 3.
7836360	7837180	Xbox 3.
7837180	7838020	Why not?
7838020	7839020	It works for PlayStation.
7839020	7840180	Why not?
7840180	7841200	All right.
7841200	7844880	Let's go to DarkSakura, your number three answer
7844880	7846460	for what should the new Xbox be referred to
7846460	7847520	as here on the program?
7847520	7848800	Xbox 420.
7852800	7855400	I wonder what this system does.
7855400	7858680	Oh man, suddenly I want to eat some Cheetos.
7858680	7860560	Oh, what do you want to play?
7860560	7861400	Fuck it.
7863120	7866560	Why is Cheech and Chong suddenly the spokespeople
7866560	7867980	for this system?
7867980	7870760	Or I guess now it's Harold and Kumar, I guess.
7870760	7872640	The Xbox 420, got to make some more of them.
7872640	7874480	All right, the Xbox 420.
7874480	7875320	All right.
7875320	7876140	I don't know, man.
7876140	7878000	They have Neil Patrick Harris back in the system.
7878000	7878840	That's true.
7878840	7881280	That is an unstoppable force right there.
7881280	7883400	Can I just say for a minute on a completely random,
7883400	7886520	stop the list list, the new Muppets movie
7886520	7887780	was so fucking awesome.
7889280	7893600	Like for real, it was a kid's movie for 30 year olds.
7893600	7894480	He has a cameo.
7894480	7896840	A lot of people have a cameo that they don't tell you about.
7896840	7898120	Neil Patrick Harris is one of them.
7898120	7899680	Also, and it's a great line too.
7899680	7904140	His voice makes the line for California screaming tolerable.
7904140	7904980	Yes.
7904980	7907640	I'm just saying the new Muppets movie is really fucking good.
7907640	7909980	It's a little bit hokey cause it's a kid's movie,
7909980	7911520	but it's great.
7911520	7913120	When someone buys my ticket, I'll go see it.
7913120	7914640	What cameo?
7915760	7916800	Line for what?
7916800	7920040	Okay, he's now the announcer for California screaming.
7920040	7923240	So he does the safety announcement,
7923240	7925540	kind of like a fair barker.
7925540	7928720	And then when you're in, sorry Rob.
7928720	7931000	Sorry, it's a name suggested in chat.
7931000	7933980	See, you in the chat can influence the list
7933980	7935000	cause I just saw a name in there
7935000	7937000	I am fucking taking for the list.
7937000	7942000	So when you're actually in the thing ready to go,
7942000	7944560	it says second thoughts, too late.
7944560	7946940	Five, four, three, two, one, boom.
7947960	7948800	Nice, all right.
7948800	7950200	So it makes it all the way better.
7950200	7951560	All right, back to the list.
7951560	7955320	So so far we have Microsoft Xbox three and Xbox four 20.
7955320	7957720	I now I have to explain this name a little bit.
7957720	7961740	My name is the Dex box.
7961740	7965660	The Dex box because Dex is short for what
7965660	7968320	in Dungeons and Dragons speak dexterity.
7968320	7971920	That's something that thieves have a high amount of.
7971920	7973720	So it's the Dex box.
7975000	7977960	And so via Microsoft Dex box steal from you.
7979320	7980160	You know what?
7980160	7981060	I always played Rangers.
7981060	7982200	All right.
7982200	7985640	The Microsoft Dex box is my answer.
7985640	7987980	Let's go to Loki for your number two answer.
7989200	7992040	Oh, I'm trying to think of really stupid Microsoft names.
7995880	7997360	Let's see.
7997360	8000600	The Microsoft windows eight entertainment system.
8000600	8002360	Yes, it's very generic and stupid,
8002360	8003200	but you know what?
8003200	8004320	It's something that sounds like
8004320	8006440	it could be a Microsoft product.
8006440	8008400	The windows eight entertainment system.
8008400	8010000	Who would call it the waiters?
8012880	8013720	Waiters.
8015760	8018060	There's a fly in my soup waiters.
8020080	8023200	Only if Harvey Fierstein can be the spokesperson
8023200	8024560	for the waiters.
8024560	8025400	That would be great.
8025400	8031680	I call my mother and tell her to get a waiters.
8031680	8033120	You could have been a doctor,
8033120	8034840	but instead you're a waiters.
8036400	8038120	I don't know why.
8038120	8039480	When I hear the name waiters,
8039480	8041360	I think about Harvey Fierstein,
8041360	8042320	but it just works.
8042320	8043160	Doesn't it?
8044760	8046700	I could have retired and broke her.
8046700	8047800	The waiters.
8047800	8049580	It has high definition connect.
8049580	8054580	You can see how big your wiener is.
8060320	8062120	It's the way it is.
8062120	8064020	And I'll tell you eight isn't enough.
8065520	8066560	Okay.
8066560	8067400	Moving on.
8068760	8069600	Dark soccer.
8069600	8072120	What's your number two pick?
8072120	8073280	Zoom box.
8073280	8075040	I almost said your number eight pick.
8075040	8076800	Your number two pick zoom box.
8076800	8077640	Zoom box.
8077640	8078960	Oh, zoom box.
8078960	8080440	X, U, N, E, B, O, X.
8082640	8085040	You want to spell it with an X instead of a Z?
8085800	8088040	Oh, okay.
8088040	8088880	Yeah.
8088880	8089720	No, I like it.
8089720	8091600	It's like, it's like Shusha.
8091600	8092720	Or you can spell it with a Z.
8092720	8093560	That's fine.
8093560	8094400	You have to spell it with a Z
8094400	8095640	because that's what the thing is.
8095640	8096480	I don't know.
8096480	8097600	I was just in the X thing.
8097600	8098440	Okay.
8098440	8099260	Zoom box.
8099260	8100320	Even though I think Microsoft retired
8100320	8101600	the zoom some time ago.
8102720	8103560	Oh yeah.
8103560	8104400	They have zoom work.
8104400	8105240	Okay.
8105240	8106060	Zoom box.
8106060	8106900	I could see that.
8106900	8107740	Maybe the zoom would be safe.
8107740	8110880	Cause it's cooler to have it zoom box.
8110880	8111720	Oh, sorry.
8111720	8112560	No dash.
8112560	8113380	Yeah.
8113380	8114220	That's how I would brand it.
8114220	8115060	If they would hire me.
8116360	8117200	Damn it.
8117200	8118040	Microsoft.
8118040	8119160	You should hire me to be your designer
8119160	8120160	because I'm amazing.
8120160	8122460	And I make all your stuff look like Apple stuff.
8124900	8126400	All right.
8126400	8127240	Let's move on.
8127240	8128600	My number two answer.
8129520	8130480	I'm going to just put this.
8130480	8131780	This is the rumored name.
8131780	8134040	And I do like this as a name for the system.
8134040	8136860	And just in case this really is the name,
8136860	8138440	I would like to be able to say we were right.
8138440	8139440	And we called it on the list.
8139440	8142200	So I'm going to put X-Box loop on the list.
8142200	8143500	Cause loop is the rumored name
8143500	8144960	or at least the working title.
8145880	8148140	That's a stupid name.
8148140	8149080	Well, it makes sense though.
8149080	8151080	360 and then loop.
8151080	8151900	I don't know.
8151900	8153000	It's X-Box loop.
8153000	8155640	It makes me think back to the books I was reading.
8155640	8158200	Spiral, loop, and then.
8158200	8159040	All right.
8159040	8162360	So that means that like some crazy ass dead girl
8162360	8164460	is going to climb out of my X-Box loop.
8164460	8167900	When I don't change a disc for seven days.
8167900	8169100	And that's how they'll market it.
8169100	8170860	Is that, you know, in seven days,
8170860	8172100	this machine will kill you.
8172100	8173500	All right.
8173500	8175460	Number one answer time.
8175460	8177620	Loki, number one for the list.
8178740	8179580	Let's see.
8182580	8187060	I'm going to do, let's see the Microsoft,
8187060	8192060	the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.
8192060	8197060	There we go.
8198220	8200900	The Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.
8200900	8202820	Wherever did that name come from?
8203820	8205460	They named it after the players.
8208460	8211180	We took your feedback and we incorporated it
8211180	8214540	into the name of our new machine and our problem.
8214540	8216980	We have an algorithm running that monitors
8216980	8220900	all sorts of voice communication over the system
8220900	8223420	and it's generated the perfect name
8223420	8225940	for our system based off of the language
8225940	8227220	that is used the most.
8228460	8232260	It's the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur
8232260	8234300	or the MTRS.
8235900	8236740	Okay.
8237980	8240540	Dark Sakura, your number one answer.
8240540	8241740	It's completely stupid.
8241740	8242920	It's X rhombus.
8243900	8245780	Cause I would really like to see them make something
8245780	8247140	in the shape of a rhomboid.
8248660	8249500	All right.
8249500	8251300	Smell and shit.
8251300	8252140	Okay.
8252140	8253900	I'm going to say for my number one is okay.
8253900	8256640	Originally I was going to do the X-Box penetrator,
8258780	8261180	which I still like as a name, but I got to say,
8261180	8264060	I was won over by something that was suggested in chat
8264060	8267280	because somebody brought up an old ass OLR joke.
8267280	8270620	That's seriously like seven years old at this point.
8270620	8273260	So I give props to, I think it was SSJ 100 Matt
8273260	8274100	that said it.
8274100	8275620	Yeah, it was SSJ 100 Matt that said it.
8275620	8278500	I'm going to go with his answer for my number one,
8278500	8282240	the X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.
8288620	8290540	Because this robots for the good guys,
8290540	8293500	we promise as these devices in our living room
8293500	8295020	become more self-aware.
8295020	8298300	The X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.
8298300	8299140	All right.
8300020	8301340	This is a really shitty list.
8301340	8303180	It is.
8303180	8304460	This is one of our worst.
8304460	8305280	All right.
8305280	8306120	At least we got Harvey Fierstein.
8306120	8306960	All right.
8306960	8309900	So we have the Microsoft X-Box three,
8309900	8314820	the X-Box four 20, the Dex box,
8314820	8318700	the waiters, the windows eight entertainment system,
8318700	8322700	the Zune box, the X-Box loop,
8322700	8326120	the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur,
8326120	8331120	the X rhombus and the X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.
8332460	8334860	I think what I'm going to do just because, you know,
8334860	8336720	we don't have a fourth person with us tonight
8336720	8337560	doing this with us.
8337560	8339620	I'm going to go with one I'm seeing in chat a lot
8339620	8341160	and just add it to the list.
8341160	8343380	I'm going to go with the X-Box lube,
8343380	8345500	which I'm seeing in the chat several times.
8345500	8347700	And I think that's off of mispronunciation.
8347700	8348540	I made a couple-
8348540	8349560	Let's call Dan in to pick one too.
8349560	8351820	A couple of weeks ago on the show,
8351820	8353820	I think I said I was talking about the loop
8353820	8356420	and I think I accidentally said the mic for the X-Box lube
8356420	8357260	or something like that.
8357260	8359900	And so everybody's like, let's call it that.
8359900	8360740	So fine.
8360740	8361560	You're ready.
8361560	8362520	That'd be the game.
8362520	8363360	We're.
8363360	8368360	It's time to open up some room in your entertainment system.
8372660	8375680	Oh, Dan, Dan's voting for waiters.
8375680	8376520	All right.
8377480	8378320	Forget it.
8378320	8379140	We got to go to the next thing.
8379140	8379980	All right.
8379980	8380820	We added one based on chats.
8380820	8382060	We added X-Box lube.
8382060	8383340	So now we have a list of 10.
8383340	8385780	We're going to take this down to a list of seven.
8385780	8390520	Sadly, it's time to start eliminating things from the list.
8390520	8391360	Lucky.
8391360	8392540	Oh wait, let me read you the list so far.
8392540	8393380	Oh wait.
8393380	8394200	I already did.
8394200	8395040	Sorry.
8395040	8395880	I'm excited.
8395880	8397220	Do you need more soda?
8397220	8398540	The X-Box lube gets me excited.
8398540	8400040	What's wrong, Rob?
8401060	8402260	So hard.
8402260	8403500	Waiters.
8403500	8404700	I need more sugar.
8406140	8407340	You're my sugar nut.
8408740	8410780	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8410780	8411920	Dex Fox.
8413160	8414780	You didn't like my dexterity joke.
8414780	8416700	It's stretching it.
8416700	8417540	Sounds too much.
8417540	8422540	Oh, it's stretching it yet another catchphrase
8423940	8425380	for the X-Box lube.
8428820	8431580	Stretching the bounds of your imagination.
8432620	8434020	Can you take this all in?
8435020	8435860	All right.
8435860	8437020	We have to take it slow.
8440680	8441520	Dark soccer.
8441520	8442620	The cat new catchphrase.
8442620	8443820	Just try to relax.
8445700	8446540	Dark soccer.
8446540	8448420	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8448420	8450420	It's nothing against you, Rob.
8450420	8451260	But?
8451260	8454260	But I'm taking off X-Box lube
8454260	8455580	because I think it's...
8456760	8458180	I hope that's not the official name
8458180	8459620	and I wouldn't want us to be associated
8459620	8461300	with it if it's the official name.
8461300	8463700	All right, so the X-Box lube comes off the list.
8463700	8465940	Dang, you guys eliminated almost my whole list.
8465940	8466780	All right.
8466780	8467820	Well, I'm not taking my own answer off.
8467820	8469760	I gotta leave at least one up there.
8469760	8471940	So the one I'm gonna take off...
8471940	8474420	I'm gonna take off Microsoft X-Box 3.
8474420	8475260	It's just...
8475260	8476100	Stupid.
8476100	8476940	Yeah, it's...
8476940	8477900	The PlayStation does that.
8477900	8478740	Come on.
8478740	8481900	I am making the chatters be more creative tonight
8481900	8483580	than pick that answer.
8483580	8484900	All right.
8484900	8486620	So here it is.
8486620	8489260	This is the official list that you can vote on.
8490180	8491620	I wonder what's gonna win.
8491620	8493900	Your number one and number two answers are welcome
8493900	8496340	through private message to sky in the chat room right now.
8496340	8497220	Here it is.

8513480	8515900	for number one and number two answers.
8515900	8518060	If you don't say which is one and which is two,
8518060	8519580	then I assume your first one is one
8519580	8520940	and your second one is two.
8521980	8524100	And of course now everybody is coming up.
8524100	8525360	Everybody's a comic now.
8525360	8526600	Act deaf in our chat room.
8526600	8527580	X-Box Lube.
8527580	8528780	Get ready to stretch.
8528780	8529620	Hecht.
8529620	8530440	X-Box Lube.
8530440	8531400	We're stretching it.
8531400	8532480	Dungeon Buster.
8532480	8536280	Gives new meaning to the term Red Ring of Death.
8536280	8541280	Oh, we're so mature.
8543300	8544140	All right.
8544140	8547820	I'm glad you guys decided on some high brow entertainment
8547820	8548660	for your day.
8549620	8550460	All right.
8550460	8552060	Sadly, there's no mailbag tonight.
8553060	8553900	Sadly.
8553900	8554740	But there's always,
8554740	8558900	but there's always time for some FUs of the week.
8558900	8563900	Yay.
8574620	8577220	FU to stuff and things.
8577220	8580240	And the stuff and things are actually stuff and things
8580240	8582460	that I'm not liberty to openly discuss.
8582460	8585660	And then FU to,
8585660	8589540	I'm going to get political here.
8589540	8593140	FU to people who vote a straight party ticket
8593140	8598140	and FU to people in high positions
8598620	8600180	who think they can cheat and get away with it
8600180	8602580	because they have cheated and gotten away with it.
8602580	8604560	People wonder why everyone's so pissed.
8604560	8605400	Done.
8607000	8608860	Fuck you to the local news stations
8608860	8612140	for counting down to Black Friday.
8612140	8613620	It was so annoying.
8613620	8615800	It's 11 o'clock and there are people lined up.
8615800	8616640	Yes.
8616640	8618220	People line up every single year.
8618220	8619740	It's not fucking news.
8620620	8623260	Don't be amazed that people are lined up for sales.
8623260	8625040	They do it all the damn time.
8627740	8631620	FU to the fact that my vacation from work is almost over.
8631620	8632540	I mean, I like my job and all,
8632540	8635540	but I really like sitting at home on my ass doing nothing.
8635540	8638740	And then FU to the fact that I'm like really getting hungry,
8638740	8642160	but I have a lovely dinner that Alan's been working on
8642160	8643720	literally all day in the crock pot,
8643720	8644680	waiting for me when I get home.
8644680	8645860	So I have that to look forward to.
8645860	8649380	But in the meantime, God damn, I want a donut.
8649380	8651080	FU to donuts for being delicious.
8651080	8653960	Fuck you to Krispy Kreme not being in Northern California.
8653960	8655620	I get Krispy Kreme in two months.
8655620	8658020	FU to Krispy Kreme not being next door.
8658020	8659420	I get Krispy Kreme in two months.
8659420	8660900	Did you work that all out?
8660900	8661920	Huh?
8661920	8664020	Well, that's still the goal time, so.
8664020	8665020	Gotcha.
8665020	8667740	All right, well, let's go back to some gaming news
8667740	8669900	and then the Skypline's coming up real soon.
8669900	8671700	1877 Game OLR, but not yet
8671700	8673180	because we still have a few more stories to get through
8673180	8674460	starting with Loki.
8674460	8677860	Yes, we were talking about new Xbox systems
8677860	8681900	and well, this is something that is kind of branching out
8681900	8683300	the Kinect a little bit.
8683300	8684940	Kinect for Windows.
8684940	8686740	It's gonna be using a new Kinect camera
8686740	8688260	because before I was like, well, you got to sit
8688260	8690720	eight feet away from your damn computer to use this thing.
8690720	8693040	But no, they're actually gonna include a firmware
8693040	8695820	that's gonna support a new near mode
8695820	8697100	that's designed to see objects
8697100	8699980	as close as 50 centimeters away from the camera.
8699980	8704980	And I guess also they're launching with this
8706580	8709580	in early 2012 a Kinect Accelerator program
8709580	8712700	which will give $20,000 each to 10 startups
8712700	8716860	using Kinect along with Microsoft development tools,
8716860	8719120	marketing visibility, and mentoring.
8720260	8721340	So it'll be interesting to see
8721340	8724900	what they use Kinect for, you know, the PC.
8724900	8727140	And obviously maybe we'll see this integrated
8727140	8731860	into, you know, like laptops and stuff like that.
8731860	8735160	So it might be interesting to see how this evolves.
8737260	8738820	One other thing I was gonna mention too
8738820	8741620	is kind of a story that we got left out.
8741620	8745500	There's a rumor that Microsoft is in the early stages
8745500	8750500	of licensing with Sony for a Kinect-enabled TV.
8750840	8751680	And obviously-
8751680	8753040	Oh yeah, I had heard about that.
8753040	8755260	Obviously it's supposed to be, I would imagine,
8755260	8758420	some sort of like, I don't know,
8758420	8760860	maybe some sort of web-enabled TV.
8760860	8763100	You know how they have the enhanced TVs now
8764220	8767440	where you can browse content online, maybe different apps.
8767440	8770340	Or maybe that's how you'll browse through movies,
8770340	8773900	you know, doing Netflix and that kind of stuff through a TV.
8773900	8776340	Be interesting to see that actually happen.
8776340	8778580	I mean, and also it'd be weird to see Sony
8778580	8781820	partnering with Microsoft on something, but I don't know.
8781820	8783700	Well, they're gonna, I mean,
8783700	8785260	I would think it's somewhat inevitable
8785260	8788620	that the next Xbox, whatever we're gonna end up calling it,
8788620	8790820	which we'll find out here in a minute,
8790820	8792340	could have Blu-ray in it.
8792340	8794260	Because, you know, it's gonna be able to, I mean,
8794260	8796860	I would think they'd go with a proprietary disc,
8796860	8798660	but maybe if it's really supposed to be, you know,
8798660	8800520	the whole Netflix-
8800520	8801460	I would think Blu-ray
8801460	8803260	because they're gonna try to get in on that.
8803260	8804480	So they're gonna have to kind of partner
8804480	8805980	with Sony for that anyway.
8805980	8807700	So it could be interesting.
8809220	8810180	Could be very interesting.
8810180	8813860	Anyway, you give us Blu-ray and we'll give you Kinect.
8813860	8816940	Are you interested in Kinect for Windows at all, Loki?
8816940	8819580	No, because I work on my laptop mostly.
8819580	8824580	So, I mean, hell, I don't use Kinect anyways on my 360.
8824600	8828320	Did you see that super fuzzy, wuzzy, feel-good commercial
8828320	8831180	that Xtafer had posted on his Facebook,
8831180	8833100	where he's like, I really like the music in this.
8833100	8835300	Ah, I've seen that before.
8835300	8837000	It showed like the doctors using Kinect.
8837000	8839280	It was basically an Apple commercial, but with Kinect.
8839280	8842300	I've seen that before and it's a neat concept
8842300	8844800	that they're showing these classrooms enabled
8844800	8848580	with all this big projection screens and doing stuff.
8848580	8850140	It's just like the, what was it,
8850140	8852260	Cisco commercials that they have
8852260	8855780	where there's kids in the US talking to kids in China
8855780	8858420	through almost like a portal or whatever.
8859340	8863660	You know, like some sort of webcam projection setup
8863660	8864900	or whatever that they got.
8864900	8867820	But, I mean, I don't know.
8867820	8870300	It's a neat idea that they'll eventually do this stuff,
8870300	8873180	but definitely with Kinect for Windows
8873180	8876780	and people creating new applications for it.
8876780	8879380	I could see more of that stuff coming about,
8879380	8884380	but it's too ideal for me.
8886940	8888900	Idealistic, I guess would be the word.
8891860	8894620	All right, I'm gonna move on with another story here.
8894620	8896900	This is also the very, very, very, very, very last call
8896900	8900500	for cage, or not cage match, listless votes.
8900500	8901700	Cause we're about done.
8903340	8905300	There's an interesting petition going on out there.
8905300	8906260	And this is not, okay,
8906260	8907860	there's like two things going on right now.
8907860	8909980	There's a really funny thing going around Facebook,
8909980	8911780	which is from like a parody site,
8911780	8916760	which is about how Xbox is turning everybody gay
8916760	8917940	and all this stuff, or not Xbox,
8917940	8920020	Skyrim is turning everybody gay and all this stuff.
8920020	8920860	And it promotes the-
8920860	8922300	You mean Skyrim job?
8922300	8923480	Exactly, something like that.
8923480	8925180	That was a really funny parody article
8925180	8926780	is on like Christwire or something like that.
8926780	8929680	It's like a onion site for religious sites.
8929680	8931580	But anyway, what I really wanna share
8931580	8932940	is this is actually a serious thing.
8932940	8934580	This is a White House petition.
8934580	8936860	Cause you know the whitehouse.gov website
8936860	8938480	will let you do your own petition.
8938480	8940780	And somebody actually started one on there,
8940780	8945780	urging the president to ban the Elder Scrolls Skyrim
8945920	8949620	for the safety of America's youths.
8949620	8951880	There were five backers that signed the petition
8951880	8955020	at the time this was posted around gaming blogs.
8955020	8957180	Of course, tons more people have signed it as a joke
8957180	8959140	or whatever after that.
8959140	8963440	But yeah, it's basically petitioning the Obama administration.
8963440	8964280	Let me read this.
8964280	8966920	Quote, immediately banned the deadly video game
8966920	8969900	known as Skyrim for the safety of America's youths.
8969900	8972100	Whereas video gaming has proven to cause social,
8972100	8974340	ethical, and health problems in people of all ages.
8974340	8975180	No it's not.
8975180	8977760	Whereas sexual perversion and homosexuality
8977760	8979900	are threatening to destroy the Christian foundations
8979900	8981460	on which this nation was built.
8983420	8984260	Did you hear that?
8984260	8987060	Your relationship is threatening America.
8987060	8987900	You know what?
8987900	8989900	Do you feel threatened by my relationship?
8989900	8990860	Girl, no.
8991740	8993020	Well you should be threatened.
8993020	8994020	Dance is a little bit.
8994020	8995360	He knows how to cook.
8996700	8997560	Anyhow.
8997560	8998760	I'm not totally not threatened
8998760	9001180	cause I want to come over for dinner.
9001180	9003280	Whereas a new video game has just been created
9003280	9005500	that far exceeds any others in the psychological
9005500	9008740	and spiritual damage it does to teens.
9008740	9012060	We ask you to ban Skyrim blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9012060	9017060	I guess this petition may have actually been created
9017580	9019720	by that same parody website.
9020700	9022380	But whatever, it's still interesting
9022380	9023980	that you can post this out there
9023980	9025740	and that it is on the official White House site.
9025740	9027860	And I bet you people signed that
9027860	9029580	not knowing that it was parody.
9029580	9030660	I bet a lot of people signed it
9030660	9032420	not knowing if it really was parody.
9032420	9033580	They didn't really know that.
9033580	9034740	That's just sad.
9034740	9035620	Yeah.
9035620	9040620	So I want to create a petition banning online petitions.
9040620	9042340	How's that sound?
9042340	9043180	Cool.
9043180	9044240	If you want a petition for something,
9044240	9047000	you go stand outside of a Walmart and get signatures.
9048040	9050840	I'd be like, hey, well, you know,
9050840	9052680	they did that on an episode of bullshit.
9052680	9053520	Did they?
9053520	9058520	About misguided patriotism and how people,
9058880	9060680	if they hear certain keywords,
9060680	9062480	will sign just about anything.
9062480	9063480	I mean, but then again, they did.
9063480	9064620	Protect children.
9064620	9066840	Yeah, but they actually did show
9066840	9070000	that it was actually the majority of people
9070000	9071960	who I think wouldn't actually sign it
9071960	9074280	because they stopped to think about it.
9074280	9076480	But then again, they also had a petition out
9076480	9081480	at a Greenpeace rally to ban H2O.
9083800	9084640	Oh yeah.
9084640	9085960	I think I remember something like that.
9085960	9090840	Like it was like ban chemical name and it was like water.
9090840	9091680	Yeah.
9091680	9092520	Yeah.
9092520	9093340	Or soda or something like that.
9093340	9094340	It was water.
9094340	9095180	Was it?
9095180	9096560	But they were like, it's dangerous chemical
9096560	9098640	and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9098640	9099800	Gotcha.
9099800	9101080	Interesting.
9101080	9101920	All right.
9101920	9103400	One more story from you, DarkSakura.
9103400	9105360	And then it's almost time for the tweets.
9105360	9106640	Like dihydrogenoxide.
9106640	9108400	At twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9108400	9110520	Hydrogen dioxide.
9110520	9111360	All right.
9112680	9113520	I'm being dumb.
9113520	9114440	Okay.
9114440	9115840	So I have another article.
9116780	9118040	Google Chrome.
9118040	9119960	Yay, Google Chrome.
9119960	9123240	Well, it's actually going to be adding in
9123240	9125720	more hardware support to the browser,
9125720	9127680	including using a game pad.
9127680	9132680	So not only will you be able to, you know, play your games,
9133620	9135900	you can play your games with your actual game pad.
9135900	9138680	And that means it's going to be, you know,
9138680	9142360	a lot more of these web only games
9142360	9144600	or it should actually start being easier to play.
9144600	9147240	I mean, we might see a bit more development for, you know,
9147240	9148400	true console style games.
9148400	9151200	I mean, we've already got a lot of NES games
9151200	9152940	emulated in flash.
9152940	9153840	We might see more.
9153840	9158840	And I like the idea of game pads in browsers,
9159320	9160780	but that's just going to lead to even more
9160780	9163680	of the emulation websites stuff.
9163680	9164520	There's a little bit more.
9164520	9165360	Yeah.
9165360	9170280	Google's actually going to put in support for web RTC,
9170280	9173480	which is a video chat thing,
9173480	9176640	but Firefox already has game pad support for the record.
9176640	9178440	Can I actually say that I do really like though,
9178440	9181720	that, you know, we had a story last week or the week before
9181720	9184800	or whenever we had a show about how, like,
9184800	9187560	you can get demos for games through YouTube now,
9187560	9188920	like there was that FIFA game.
9188920	9190800	Like, so it would make a lot of sense
9190800	9193420	that game pads will be enabled within the browser
9193420	9194880	because like a lot of stuff seems like
9194880	9196920	it's going to be streaming like right through your browser
9196920	9199320	and shit, people play the Facebook games
9199320	9203200	and probably a Google Plus game is looking at using this
9203200	9204620	if Google Chrome is launching it.
9204620	9207680	So it's interesting.
9207680	9209520	But yeah, that's that kind of support.
9209520	9210760	I can support.
9210760	9212400	Ha.
9212400	9213600	All right.
9213600	9214660	Let's see.
9214660	9217560	We're about to get to the Twitter and last minute stories,
9217560	9219600	but I think we should do some listless results.
9219600	9221340	Shouldn't we find out what we're going to be calling
9221340	9223280	the new Xbox officially?
9223280	9224120	Well, yeah.
9224120	9226680	Cause you know, after tonight, it's no more Xbox 720.
9226680	9228360	We will be calling it by this name.
9228360	9230640	The bend over and take it like a man.
9230640	9231620	Let's find out.
9231620	9234880	Let's see if, let's see who got their way.
9234880	9239880	In at number three is a tie.
9242240	9245120	Number three answer for what we should call the new system.
9245120	9249680	The Xbox 420 as you know, we have a few stoners in our chat
9249680	9253960	and the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.
9253960	9255160	Yeah.
9255160	9257340	Tied for your number three answer.
9257340	9260440	The number two thing you most want to call the new Xbox
9260440	9264920	is the Xbox non-silon occupied Caprica.
9264920	9266880	Yay.
9266880	9270360	And the number one answer, can I put it this way?
9270360	9273320	It got twice as many votes as the number two answer.
9273320	9274440	The number one answer.
9274440	9279440	The Xbox lube is the official name of the new Xbox console.
9280720	9282360	Congratulations, chatters.
9282360	9285960	Congratulations, Microsoft and the Xbox lube.
9285960	9287560	Do you think you can handle it?
9287560	9291440	I think it should be bend over and take it like a man.
9292480	9295440	Very, very narrowly missing the list by the way.
9295440	9297320	Waiters didn't make the top three.
9297320	9298440	Did you notice that?
9298440	9299840	That's poopy.
9299840	9302240	Even after my Harvey Fierstein impersonation,
9302240	9303360	Waiters missed the list.
9303360	9304320	I think that might've hurt it.
9304320	9305160	That might've hurt.
9305160	9306640	You're right, it might've hurt its chances.
9306640	9309160	They were raised badly.
9309160	9310880	Their mothers didn't do their job.
9312200	9313340	All right, so there it is.
9313340	9316820	The Xbox lube is the official new title of the Xbox console.
9316820	9318440	And here on the show, here in chat,
9318440	9320680	and hopefully soon across the entirety of the internet.
9320680	9322440	Can we call it the X Blube?
9322440	9323680	Sure, we can call it the X Blube
9323680	9327760	and other fun creations there will be Xbox lube.
9327760	9331040	All right, let's get to last minute stories.
9331040	9332080	I don't know, again,
9332080	9333680	we were in an interesting situation this week
9333680	9336620	because we lost the usual way we prepped the show.
9336620	9337880	So does anybody have anything they want to add?
9337880	9339560	Dark soccer, were there any stories
9339560	9341280	that you wanted to get to that we didn't?
9341280	9342520	No, not really.
9342520	9344460	Well, actually, hold on, there was one.
9344460	9345300	There was one.
9345300	9346120	Loki do one.
9346120	9348920	Hopefully it's not the same story or you're screwed.
9348920	9351000	South Korea has put it into effect
9351000	9353640	what they're calling the Cinderella law.
9353640	9358040	Basically, they're working with their internet providers
9358040	9361320	that they're going to block players from under 16
9363280	9367200	from playing between midnight and 6 a.m.
9367200	9371000	on online services such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
9372700	9373880	What?
9373880	9375640	It is in Korea.
9375640	9378320	Well, didn't they ban MMOs too?
9378320	9379160	Yes, they did.
9379160	9380120	Was that South or North that did that?
9380120	9381560	South Korea.
9381560	9383080	Okay.
9383080	9385220	Okay, I've got a couple.
9385220	9387960	One of them is that Microsoft bought a video surf
9387960	9389560	to use on Xbox Live.
9389560	9390800	Interesting, what's video surf do?
9390800	9392800	It's a search engine,
9392800	9397040	but it's saying that the overtime technology,
9397040	9399640	it says it's supposed to be integrated with Xbox Live
9399640	9403720	and that you can use it to search for TV film
9403720	9406680	across several Xbox Live applications,
9406680	9409820	left film, zoom, et cetera.
9410800	9414360	The U.S. will, okay, in the UK,
9414360	9417380	they're getting BBC content
9417380	9420000	and the U.S. will get Bravo, Comcast, HBO Go,
9420000	9422480	Verizon, FiOS and sci-fi.
9422480	9424400	Wait, wait, wait, we're going to get Bravo?
9424400	9425240	Yeah.
9426600	9427760	I know, I was like.
9429520	9431640	I can't wait for the Real Housewives of,
9431640	9433840	you know, Boulder, Colorado
9433840	9435560	or wherever they're going to go next.
9435560	9438240	And then, you probably said something about this
9438240	9439840	on Hoard House.
9439840	9441120	Yes, I did, go ahead.
9441120	9444100	Yeah, about the talent calculator being live
9444100	9445780	for Mista Pandaria.
9445780	9447920	Or as I call it, MOP.
9447920	9450120	Which is notable because the game itself
9450120	9452280	shouldn't be out for at least another six months,
9452280	9454000	if not more like nine to 12.
9454000	9455520	So it's interesting that the talent calculator
9455520	9456480	is already out there.
9456480	9460940	So you can see how talented you want to be at MOPing.
9460940	9461780	There you go.
9462880	9463720	Loki?
9463720	9466080	Oh, the calculator for Monk is not available.
9466080	9468240	Right, because they don't want to give everything away.
9468240	9469080	Yeah.
9470080	9470920	Loki.
9470920	9471760	A few things.
9471760	9474500	There was supposed to be a lawsuit against EA
9474500	9478960	for reneging on the fact that Battlefield 1943
9478960	9483500	didn't come with Battlefield 3 or something like that.
9485160	9487280	So now they're going to be giving away.
9487280	9488720	The other way around, by the way.
9488720	9490040	Whatever.
9490040	9493880	They're going to be giving away Battlefield 1943 vouchers
9493880	9496680	to everybody that bought the PlayStation 3
9496680	9498400	version of Battlefield 3.
9498400	9501940	And to redeem this, you have to go to their portal,
9501940	9506180	which is 1943redemption.battlefield.com
9506180	9509720	with your origin ID and request a download code
9509720	9510920	for your region.
9510920	9513540	And codes will be available for European customers
9513540	9516200	as soon as, well, November 26th.
9516200	9517820	So they should already be available.
9517820	9521980	And Americans, you'll have to wait until the 10th
9521980	9525140	of December before those are available.
9527440	9529760	So that's good that they finally came through with that.
9529760	9531680	Unfortunately, it took a lot to do that.
9531680	9533280	And I'm not sure if we reported on this before,
9533280	9535320	but same thing happened with Saints Row the Third.
9535320	9536800	They were supposed to be getting an exclusive content
9536800	9538200	for Saints Row the Third.
9538200	9540360	And THQ came now.
9540360	9545360	If you sign up, if you log in your online pass
9545360	9548640	that comes with the new copies of Saints Row the Third,
9548640	9551280	or if you buy the game and buy the online pass,
9551280	9553560	you know, if you buy the game used and buy the online pass,
9553560	9556720	as long as you redeem that pass by,
9556720	9558120	I forget what the time frame is,
9558120	9561800	you get a free copy or a free download of Saints Row 2
9561800	9564620	on the PlayStation 3, which is pretty awesome.
9564620	9567280	So definitely worth checking that out.
9568600	9571080	Cthulhu Saves the World Bundle has sold
9571080	9573280	100,000 copies on Steam.
9573280	9576560	How many did they sell on Xbox Live Arcade or indie games?
9576560	9580400	Indie games, they have only moved 55,000 to date.
9581400	9586160	And that's been available since December 2010.
9586160	9588520	Sadly, that's still more than I would have thought.
9588520	9591060	And, actually, wait a second here.
9591060	9595180	I'm sorry, Breath of Death, Breath of Death 7,
9595180	9599620	has been available since April 2010 on Xbox Live indie games
9599620	9602680	and has moved 55,000 copies to date.
9602680	9605400	Cthulhu Saves the World has been available
9605400	9610400	since December 2010 and has only generated 20,000 downloads.
9610920	9611760	Yikes.
9611760	9615560	And apparently, I don't know when it went up on Steam,
9615560	9620560	but they sold 100,000 copies.
9620600	9622360	Oh, since July.
9622360	9623880	July.
9623880	9625160	So, yeah.
9625160	9626280	Big difference there.
9626280	9627960	Apparently their next title that they're working on
9627960	9632060	is actually was the once canceled Penny Arcade Adventures
9632060	9636240	on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness, episode three.
9636240	9637840	Oh, interesting.
9637840	9639600	So these guys picked it up.
9639600	9640440	Yeah.
9641280	9642440	So it's interesting.
9643360	9647040	Also, what's also interesting, Elder Scrolls Skyrim
9647040	9652040	has much of the, I guess, land of Tamriel from, was it?
9654340	9657000	Yeah, there was a video of that up of the guy,
9657000	9657840	no clipping, right?
9657840	9659880	Yeah, from Morrowind.
9659880	9662000	And people are assuming that's just from,
9663720	9665720	because the way they display the map or whatever,
9665720	9667560	that they just want it to be complete.
9668960	9670560	Well, it's still neat either way.
9672640	9675280	And of course, Skyrim got a patch on PC,
9675280	9678920	but what's kind of annoying is that they added
9678920	9682600	mandatory Steam DRM and they've also killed
9682600	9685560	some of the tweaks that you can do in the game.
9685560	9687180	So that kind of sucks.
9687180	9691940	And then last but not least,
9691940	9694340	new dashboard update for the Xbox 360
9694340	9696220	has been dated for December 6th.
9696220	9698200	Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of big news we missed, huh?
9698200	9701160	And that of course will be bringing cloud storage
9701160	9703420	as well as the beacon support,
9703420	9706460	which is I believe live already on Xbox.com.
9706460	9707820	Isn't that kind of like the,
9707820	9710500	don't you want to play these games with me type of thing?
9710500	9712620	Yeah, like you go, hey, I'm playing Call of Duty
9712620	9714700	later today, and so you can see that.
9714700	9715620	That's kind of cool, I guess.
9715620	9718300	Something, so they have that.
9718300	9719780	And then also of course the redesign
9719780	9721700	to make it look like Windows Phone 7.
9723580	9724940	Let's open up the Skype line.
9724940	9726220	We're ready to take your calls.
9726220	9729780	1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number,
9729780	9731300	or you can look us up on Skype.
9731300	9734340	Username is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
9734340	9737860	877 number is free in the US and Canada, toll free.
9737860	9739860	Can't say the same everywhere else,
9739860	9743260	so definitely use Skype if you're somewhere else.
9743260	9745860	OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.
9745860	9748420	Meanwhile, we have just a couple of tweets for you.
9748420	9751140	We didn't get a whole lot tonight, but just a couple.
9751140	9754580	We'll start here with a link from TigerClaw on Twitter.
9754580	9756420	Send us a reminder.
9756420	9757420	I did read about this earlier.
9757420	9758440	I didn't make the show roll tonight,
9758440	9761100	but he reminds us just in time for Christmas,
9761100	9764900	the Batcave will be Arkham City's newest challenge map.
9764900	9766680	So there is gonna be some DLC that hits,
9766680	9768580	and I think the date was December 20th.
9768580	9771060	Yeah, December 20th is gonna be a new DLC pack.
9771060	9773220	Of course, this is for Arkham City,
9773220	9776020	and it's actually gonna be a Batcave challenge map.
9776020	9778820	It's also gonna contain the Iceberg Lounge
9778820	9780420	and Joker's Carnival.
9780420	9783180	So yeah, that's gonna be coming out December 20th.
9783180	9786860	Didn't the Robin pack hit this week?
9786860	9788100	Yeah.
9788100	9789340	Gotta check that out,
9789340	9791900	because yeah, I don't know much about
9791900	9793380	what's supposed to be in that Robin pack,
9793380	9794580	except well, of course, Robin.
9794580	9795540	You can play as Robin.
9795540	9796820	Yeah, and they have some challenge maps also.
9796820	9798660	I wonder if they integrate him into the story,
9798660	9799540	like they do Catwoman.
9799540	9802220	I think he's supposed to be integrated into the story.
9802220	9803060	That's kind of rad.
9803060	9804980	I might have to check that out, so.
9806420	9809140	All right, again, the phone is open 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9809140	9812460	or as your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9812460	9815460	We are getting a call, so let's go to the phones.
9815460	9816780	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9816780	9817620	Who's this?
9818660	9820040	Well, it's Jester Scott.
9820040	9822060	Jester Scott, welcome to the show.
9823840	9824680	Hi.
9824680	9826780	Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?
9826780	9829620	I had a couple of things.
9829620	9831100	I think that you were talking about
9831100	9834100	the GameStop stickers one time,
9834100	9835480	how they've gotten a little bit better
9835480	9836640	from being so sticky.
9840060	9842740	Well, I bought Zelda on Sunday, of course,
9842740	9844220	I bought the collector's edition,
9844220	9846140	and it had this giant sticker on it.
9846140	9848180	Oh, wait, okay, wait, you're talking about
9848180	9850220	how they will seal up a used,
9850220	9852140	or the ones that were opened,
9852140	9853860	or like their last copy or whatever,
9853860	9855340	with those big stickers,
9855340	9858180	and I think you were saying something about this, Loki,
9858180	9859580	like you used to be able to kind of
9859580	9861700	very carefully take those things off,
9861700	9862580	and you could put it back on.
9862580	9864000	Somebody was, I think we had a guest,
9864000	9864840	or somebody was saying something about that.
9864840	9866500	No, that wasn't me.
9866500	9867700	Maybe it was another podcast,
9867700	9869420	but I know I've heard that before.
9869420	9870700	So, okay, I see where you're going.
9870700	9872500	At first, I was like, GameStop stickers, what?
9872500	9874060	Okay, I get where you're going with this.
9874060	9876020	Okay, so you just bought Zelda, sorry.
9877100	9879760	Right, well, normally the new stickers
9879760	9881140	can come off very easily now,
9881140	9883460	instead of leaving that sticky residue, right?
9883460	9884360	Yeah.
9884360	9886500	Well, I go to take off my sticker
9886500	9889060	on the Zelda copy that I got.
9889060	9891120	Well, the front of it's foil.
9891120	9892980	Guess what came off?
9892980	9893820	The foil.
9893820	9894660	The entire foil.
9894660	9895940	The foil came off.
9895940	9898860	So the new stickers are not so awesome.
9898860	9901020	It's in my eyes anymore.
9901020	9902280	Well, you know what that means.
9902280	9904060	They were onto our schemes.
9904060	9905940	They started reading the internet,
9905940	9908100	and they knew that people were just opening them
9908100	9911100	and then trying to return them like they were new.
9911100	9912060	But you know why?
9912060	9917060	They deserve it for that crappy policy anyway, so.
9918340	9919700	But whatever.
9919700	9921820	I don't even know why mine had a sticker
9921820	9924060	on it in the first place, I pre-ordered it.
9925060	9927140	Wait, you had actually pre-ordered Zelda
9927140	9929560	and you still got a copy like that?
9929560	9930400	Yep.
9930400	9932460	It wasn't in the shrink wrap?
9932460	9933800	Oh, no, no, no.
9933800	9934900	It was sealed and everything,
9934900	9936620	just still had that big ass sticker
9936620	9937820	on the front of the box.
9938940	9941620	Oh, so now when you took it off,
9941620	9943180	like, now your box has it
9943180	9946740	and you won't be able to sell it on eBay or anything, huh?
9946740	9947560	No.
9947560	9948900	Well, I wasn't gonna sell it anyway.
9948900	9950620	It's just an eye store.
9950620	9953140	So they had a sticker underneath the shrink wrap?
9954180	9955740	No, no, no.
9955740	9960740	The box to Zelda has a case inside of the box.
9960940	9963300	You're talking about the collector's edition,
9963300	9965020	or it had a slip sleeve like the,
9966220	9967820	now was it the one with the remote?
9967820	9971540	It was kind of like the 25th anniversary for Mario.
9971540	9973860	The whole box didn't have a flap.
9975740	9976580	I getcha.
9978020	9979460	Yeah, the front of that foil
9979460	9983460	and the big old sticker they had on it took off the foil.
9983460	9985740	Well, let me go this direction
9985740	9987900	because you've actually played the new Zelda then,
9987900	9988720	which is something,
9988720	9990120	despite all the other games that are out right now,
9990120	9991540	we haven't had a chance to play.
9991540	9993940	How do you like the new Zelda game?
9993940	9996300	Oh my God.
9996300	9998220	I think it's amazing.
9998220	9999460	Yeah?
9999460	10001640	Yes, the controls are a little finicky.
10002740	10003660	You have to get used to it
10003660	10006720	because it fully uses the Wii Motion Plus
10006720	10008540	or motion controls, whatever it is.
10012240	10013540	It goes in a different direction.
10013540	10015260	Yes, the graphics are a little toned down,
10015260	10018100	but the game is very, very long.
10018100	10018940	How do you-
10018940	10020140	I've passed 30 hours into it
10020140	10022500	and either I really suck
10022500	10024740	or this game is extremely long.
10025940	10029300	How is it different from Twilight Princess?
10029300	10030260	What would you say?
10031340	10033660	Well, I didn't play very much of Twilight Princess.
10033660	10034820	I know, gamer shame.
10036820	10040380	But I don't know.
10040380	10043580	It's just like anytime you move your arm
10043580	10045920	or anything that,
10047100	10049420	any move you make with your Wiimote,
10050500	10053220	link on the screen will make that movement.
10053220	10055300	And it's kind of funny
10055300	10059420	because if you're sitting down playing Zelda
10059420	10061860	and he kind of holds his sword out,
10061860	10063540	he looks retarded on the screen.
10063540	10064900	He's just running around with his sword
10064900	10066500	just kind of straight up in the air,
10066500	10068500	straight in front of him.
10068500	10073020	So, but it will just mimic the movement of your hand,
10073020	10073860	literally.
10073860	10075900	So it sounds like the Wii Motion Plus
10075900	10077380	really added a lot more
10077380	10079140	than maybe sometimes we give it credit for.
10079140	10081840	The extra technology really kind of added a lot to it.
10081840	10085120	Yeah, and I've been reading a little bit of hate
10085120	10086360	of that online.
10086360	10088880	You know, like, oh, well, but it's Zelda.
10088880	10090940	Why can't they just do it for a controller?
10090940	10092360	Well, if you think about it,
10092360	10093480	with every Zelda game,
10093480	10095640	well, nearly every Zelda game,
10095640	10097240	they've done something different.
10099280	10102160	So, I mean, the first one was that top view.
10102160	10104560	The second one had a top view,
10104560	10106960	but it would also go into side scrolling.
10106960	10110520	So, I mean, just keep going from there.
10110520	10113640	Besides, most of the guys playing this game,
10113640	10115880	their right hand should be in fine shape anyway
10115880	10117480	to wag it around, right?
10118620	10119460	Yeah.
10119460	10120280	All right.
10120280	10121120	Well, buddy, I'm gonna let you go
10121120	10121960	so we can get some more calls,
10121960	10124780	but thanks so much for the call and enjoy Zelda, okay?
10124780	10125620	Oh, that one.
10125620	10126680	All right, have a good one.
10127840	10130360	Later, 1877 game OLR,
10130360	10132240	or a username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.
10132240	10133240	I think that was a new caller.
10133240	10134400	I don't recognize that name.
10134400	10135680	I recognize it from chat right now,
10135680	10137880	but I don't think that person's called in before.
10137880	10140560	I heard a little Southern accent, didn't you?
10140560	10141400	Yeah, a little.
10141400	10142220	I heard a little.
10142220	10143060	All right.
10143060	10145480	Anyhow, moving on, going back to the Twitters.
10145480	10147100	Dark Tetsuya sent us a tweet.
10147100	10151220	Coming soon to Xbox Live Indie Games, Nyan Cat Adventure.
10151220	10154440	It is from the people behind Techno Kitten Adventure.
10154440	10158200	I guess they are actually creating a Nyan Cat game.
10159360	10162520	There's already a Nyan Cat game for iPhone.
10162520	10163400	There is an iPhone,
10163400	10166120	but I guess this is the official quote unquote one
10166120	10169320	that's going to be on Xbox Live.
10169320	10170920	And I like the little box art.
10170920	10172180	They have a Facebook
10172180	10173980	that has some limited pictures and stuff,
10173980	10176440	but I love what they did at the bottom.
10176440	10179760	They made this rip off of the Nintendo seal of quality,
10179760	10183480	and it's the official Nyan-tendo seal.
10184780	10187440	I hope they get that by the Xbox sensors.
10188420	10189460	Nyan-tendo.
10191000	10192960	1877 game OLR,
10192960	10196160	or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10197120	10200440	Let's see, more tweets.
10200440	10203200	Oh, I like this one from Mantis Knight on Twitter.
10204240	10208040	One topic please discuss is,
10208040	10211880	is free to play MMORPGs really a good thing?
10213880	10216680	Are free to play MMOs really a good thing?
10216680	10217580	Hell yes.
10218760	10220080	Depends who it's good for.
10220080	10222880	As far as being good to get people to try your game,
10222880	10224320	yes.
10224320	10226640	Whether people try your game
10226640	10229160	and then decide to pay for stuff, maybe not.
10231600	10233960	I see no problem because I mean,
10233960	10235600	I was paying for Star Trek Online
10235600	10238000	and then had cryptic points.
10238000	10240980	So no big there.
10240980	10242800	I've heard of where free to play
10242800	10245640	has kind of driven games downhill though,
10245640	10247480	or at least according to some of the loyal people
10247480	10248600	who play the game.
10248600	10252020	And like one example I could think of for that
10252020	10253320	is Team Fortress 2.
10253320	10255820	Now note, I'm not saying Team Fortress 2 is a bad game.
10255820	10257320	It's not, it's a good game.
10257320	10260080	But some people, you might remember we reported on this,
10260080	10262480	when Team Fortress 2 first went free to play,
10262480	10264960	the community was very against that.
10264960	10267600	Well, some of the community was very against that.
10267600	10268540	In fact, they went so far,
10268540	10271040	remember there were some servers that would ban you
10271040	10273480	if it caught that you were using the free to play version,
10273480	10275120	like somehow they could tell the difference.
10275120	10277400	And it was like, we don't want these people here.
10277400	10278860	And sometimes an MMO is like,
10278860	10281340	I can imagine a game like DC Universe.
10281340	10283920	Like one day you're paying for DC Universe, right?
10283920	10285520	You're paying your $15 a month.
10285520	10287800	Suddenly the game goes free to play.
10287800	10290840	Now your servers are drowning under all the people
10290840	10292400	that are trying to get on the server.
10292400	10294400	And it's like, where it might be a good thing
10294400	10296300	that more people are playing your game.
10296300	10298580	Now it's all these people who didn't pay anything to get in.
10298580	10301080	So it's kind of like they might be ruining the party
10301080	10301920	a little bit.
10301920	10302740	Does that make sense?
10304360	10306000	What if they, what if these companies
10306000	10308600	actually did have a pay only server?
10308600	10310800	Or you know, like an old school server
10310800	10313120	or like new servers just for new people or something.
10313120	10314560	That could be a way to get around it.
10314560	10315720	We'll come back to this topic in a minute,
10315720	10316720	but first we have another call.
10316720	10317760	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10317760	10318600	Who's this?
10320000	10322480	Hey, this is Cloud of Cleveland.
10322480	10323320	Cloud Cleveland?
10323320	10324680	I haven't been in a chat for a long time.
10324680	10326080	Hey, well, what's up buddy?
10327360	10328200	Yo, bro.
10328200	10330840	Hey, Rob, you are a Rez fan, right?
10330840	10331760	For the old Dreamcast?
10331760	10333020	Frickin' love Rez.
10333020	10334720	Happy 10 year anniversary.
10334720	10336280	Hell yeah.
10336280	10337120	I know, right?
10337120	10338840	Have you gotten to play Child of Eden yet?
10338840	10339680	I do.
10339680	10340840	I have played Child of Eden.
10340840	10342200	Child of Eden, I want to play it
10342200	10345060	on the PlayStation 3 for real.
10345060	10347980	I liked it, but I thought the Kinect control
10347980	10348820	was a little weird.
10348820	10350400	It was like cool to play once,
10350400	10352900	but I prefer just playing it with a controller.
10352900	10355480	And I didn't like the music as much as I liked Rez.
10355480	10357680	I really didn't, but it was still a good game.
10357680	10360240	I couldn't let people say that actually about the music.
10360240	10362160	It just, you know, I mean, it's not that it was bad.
10362160	10363200	It wasn't bad by anything means.
10363200	10364560	And I'm always going to love anything
10364560	10369920	Tetsuya Mizuguchi puts out, but it wasn't Rez.
10369920	10373560	And the price was tough to swallow,
10373560	10377280	but you know, there's a lot of weird stuff
10377280	10378400	that comes out for a high price.
10378400	10381400	Like, at least it was better than five cars
10381400	10382920	and three tracks.
10382920	10385320	It was a better game than that, that's for sure.
10386820	10388700	Okay, maybe I'll wait for it to go budget title
10388700	10390200	before I actually pick it up myself.
10390200	10391520	Well, there's a lot of Black Friday videos.
10391520	10392640	My gosh, dude.
10392640	10397640	I would say, my God, Mario 3D Land.
10399260	10402740	You know, between that and Kirby Return to Dream Land,
10402740	10404940	those two games have really put a lot of faith
10404940	10406620	into Nintendo for me.
10406620	10408960	Isn't it funny how the entire internet,
10408960	10411260	and this show included, or at least myself,
10411260	10413500	I can't speak for the other two,
10413500	10417080	but it's so interesting the love-hate relationship
10417080	10417920	we have with Nintendo,
10417920	10419520	is that sometimes we look at the decisions they make
10419520	10421260	and we go, you guys are idiots.
10421260	10422840	Like, why are you doing this?
10422840	10425100	Why don't you understand online?
10425100	10426580	You know, how many years has it been?
10426580	10428300	God damn, friend codes?
10428300	10430500	Why do we always hurt the ones we love?
10430500	10433460	Right, but then they go and they put out
10433460	10437040	fucking Mario 3D Land, this Kirby game,
10437040	10439480	which I hear is really good, Zelda,
10439480	10444280	and supposedly, assuming Mario Kart 7 is just as good,
10444280	10447740	it's like, damn, we got a lot of good games all at once,
10447740	10451220	and oh shit, the golden rule of gaming really is
10451220	10453720	a system is only as good as the games that are on it,
10453720	10455860	and you have to take a step back and say,
10455860	10458040	well shit, these are some really good games,
10458040	10461460	so despite all the bonehead moves Nintendo makes sometimes,
10461460	10464280	sometimes when it's right, it's really right.
10465860	10468360	Oh no, I mean, now it's completely worth having to weave
10468360	10470560	for me, I've actually pulled it out of my closet
10470560	10472460	just to be able to play these games,
10472460	10476000	and thankfully, the 3DS didn't have to wait as long
10476000	10477300	for some decent games,
10477300	10479720	and hopefully this won't be the end of it.
10479720	10481860	Yeah, it's interesting, there's been other stories
10481860	10484280	this week that Reggie is saying that just because
10484280	10485820	the Wii U is coming out does not mean
10485820	10487580	the Wii's life cycle is done,
10487580	10489420	and I think a lot of us are looking at that
10489420	10490700	with kind of one eyebrow raised,
10490700	10493020	like, how are the systems going to coexist?
10493020	10495520	And I think you kind of have to say that to some extent,
10495520	10497540	because you don't want the Wiis to stop selling
10497540	10501140	this holiday season, I still think Xenoblade's
10501140	10504540	gonna come out, I think that, hmm,
10504540	10505700	I always go back and forth with this,
10505700	10508020	I swore up and down that if they didn't announce
10508020	10510000	it at Penny Arcade, it wasn't fucking happening,
10510000	10511380	but I'm kind of like, you know,
10511380	10513840	what else do they fucking have next year?
10513840	10516160	They've gotta have almost all of their people
10516160	10519440	working on making the Wii U better,
10519440	10521480	because it's gotta be better at next year's E3,
10521480	10523500	I think you're gonna see a much different system
10523500	10526680	next year's E3, and I don't mean like,
10526680	10528600	suddenly it's not gonna have a touchscreen anymore,
10528600	10530020	any of that stuff, I just mean,
10530020	10531520	you're gonna definitely see the games,
10531520	10533160	you're gonna see the reason why Nintendo
10533160	10535000	really believes in this, you're gonna see this E3,
10535000	10538440	is that they can't prove that, that system is fucked.
10538440	10543440	But I think because they've got all their people
10543800	10546540	working to make the Wii U great,
10546540	10549860	they're kinda keeping this backlog of Wii things
10549860	10551920	that they can release through 2012,
10551920	10554600	and that's what I think has happened to the last story
10554600	10556840	and Xenoblade and all these rainfall games,
10556840	10559280	is that I think you're gonna slowly see them
10559280	10561960	trickle out through 2012, because Nintendo
10561960	10564560	can't afford to work on anything for the Wii right now,
10564560	10566280	yet at the same time, they can't afford
10566280	10567720	to just let the Wii die.
10567720	10570520	So they don't wanna blow their load this holiday season.
10570520	10573920	They've gotta let it kinda trickle out through 2012.
10573920	10577340	So I think you still will see those games come out.
10577340	10579060	Will the people that are so diehard
10579060	10581160	on Operation Rainfall still give a damn?
10581160	10583560	Because I'll tell you from first-hand experience,
10583560	10586520	it's really easy to download Xenoblade from the internet
10586520	10588280	and play it on your Wii right now.
10588280	10590960	Like, you don't have to do a hardware modification to it.
10590960	10593920	So will the internet collectively still care
10593920	10595200	this time next year?
10595200	10598200	That's, because especially a game like Xenoblade
10598200	10599500	is really for the core gamer.
10599500	10601340	You can't sell Xenoblade to a soccer mom
10601340	10602920	with her seven-year-olds.
10602920	10604500	But Xenoblade is a really good game
10604500	10606700	that if you do own a Wii, you should check out.
10607980	10608820	So.
10608820	10609720	All right, I won't actually look into that one.
10609720	10610640	Thanks for the suggestion.
10610640	10612880	No problem, except for you,
10612880	10614440	unless you happen to be in Europe,
10614440	10616880	you won't find it here, or you're gonna have to turn
10616880	10619360	to the dark side of the internet,
10619360	10620840	which SOPA may eliminate.
10620840	10624160	So get it now while you still can.
10624160	10625720	Yeah, I hope not.
10625720	10627960	I don't usually advocate piracy,
10627960	10630040	but when the company leaves you no other choice
10630040	10632520	to play the game, I don't know what else to tell people.
10632520	10633760	Xenoblade's a great game.
10635800	10638200	Yeah, you know, if you can't get the licensing
10638200	10642080	in your country or whatever, you know, other options, man.
10642080	10643440	Yep, so.
10643440	10645280	All right, well, anything else you want to ask
10645280	10647500	or get out with the show tonight?
10648900	10650140	No, that's about it, bro.
10650140	10651520	All right, well, thanks so much for your call,
10651520	10653480	and have fun with Child of Eden.
10653480	10654760	You should get it when it,
10654760	10656440	you're gonna see a lot of good sales through the holidays.
10656440	10657800	So definitely check it out.
10659120	10659960	Right.
10659960	10660780	All right, take care, buddy.
10662000	10665040	1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype
10665040	10667640	is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
10668880	10670080	Love to hear from you.
10670080	10671480	Did I finish all the tweets or was there one of them?
10671480	10673680	Oh, we were still on the free-to-play thing.
10673680	10674740	We were talking about that.
10674740	10676480	And Dark Soccer, you were talking about
10676480	10678380	that you kind of, even your experiences,
10678380	10682240	you know, the Star Wars, or Star Trek, thank you.
10682240	10683080	I really should know better.
10683080	10684920	But it would just be certain things that I would want,
10684920	10686760	and they would be very reasonable.
10686760	10690600	Like, I could get a thing of the lowest end
10690600	10692240	of Cryptic Point or something,
10692240	10695820	and it would last me through, like, months of releases.
10695820	10696660	Yeah.
10696660	10697840	So.
10697840	10699200	All right.
10699200	10700480	Since the phone's not ringing again,
10700480	10701660	I think we're actually gonna shut it down,
10701660	10702500	because believe it or not,
10702500	10703960	this has been a long show tonight,
10703960	10705640	especially considering our website is down
10705640	10707600	and we weren't able to do a proper show roll.
10707600	10709160	We did a good job filling time.
10709160	10710700	So we gotta wrap up.
10710700	10712760	That was it for the tweets, too.
10712760	10715400	And we gotta get everybody's final thoughts
10715400	10716260	before we wrap up.
10716260	10718480	I think we already did last-minute stories.
10718480	10722560	So let's get everybody's last-minute thoughts.
10722560	10725680	My final thought tonight is I'm excited to go home
10725680	10727800	and eat, yay, food, I love food.
10727800	10729040	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10729040	10732600	Making good headway on Call of Duty formatting.
10732600	10733920	And last but not least, Dark Soccer,
10733920	10734760	your final thought tonight?
10734760	10736760	My night is far from over.
10736760	10738000	Woo-hoo!
10738000	10738820	All right.
10738820	10740600	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show
10740600	10741880	and tuning into Orange Laundry Radio.
10741880	10743160	We really appreciate your support.
10743160	10746560	Hey, especially when poopy things happen to us,
10746560	10749400	like, you know, our internet goes out
10749400	10751440	so we can't do a show one week randomly,
10751440	10754640	or, you know, our website suddenly goes down.
10754640	10756880	We really appreciate that you guys stand by with us.
10756880	10758080	Even though I know the podcasties
10758080	10758920	will be a little bit behind,
10758920	10761640	we still had a very full chat room tonight,
10761640	10764000	and I really appreciate that, all things considered.
10764000	10765080	Considering we don't have a website
10765080	10766640	where you can go to chat.orangelaundryradio.com
10766640	10767480	or any of that.
10767480	10769560	So, really appreciate you guys.
10769560	10770840	If you like what you heard,
10770840	10772280	we're not begging for your money.
10772280	10775320	All we ask, tell people about the show, word of mouth.
10776440	10778640	Help spread the word about the show.
10778640	10781120	Tell a person who may not have heard of it about the show,
10781120	10782760	and help the O.L. Army grow.
10782760	10787360	And we can spread the word, the term of Xbox lube,
10787360	10789880	throughout the universe.
10789880	10792320	That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundry Radio.
10792320	10794440	We'll be back next week, hopefully with a website
10794440	10795880	and everything to do it all over again
10795880	10797360	with next week in gaming news.
10797360	10801000	And I'm sure even more games to be played this week,
10801000	10803040	including, it sounds like Mario Kart 7,
10803920	10807240	but in a couple, by this time next week, right?
10807240	10809400	The fourth, oh my God.
10809400	10811840	So much more coming, so we'll be back next week.
10811840	10814320	Until then, have a great week.
10814320	10816680	And don't be a dick to each other online.
