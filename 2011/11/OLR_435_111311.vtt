00:00.000 --> 00:19.440
Today, November 13th, 2011, DC Universe explodes after going free to play.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.880
The way to import UMDs to the PS Vita is revealed, and could the Wii U support multiple tablet

00:24.880 --> 00:31.880
controllers after all?

00:31.880 --> 00:35.080
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.080 --> 00:38.800
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.800 --> 00:46.920
We are live tonight, November the 13th of 2011, with the 435th episode of our show.

00:46.920 --> 00:52.560
We are live, of course, at All Games Radio, as we are every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.960
We tape live Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

00:56.960 --> 00:58.040
show.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.360
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.320
Say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
Hi.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.320
How are you, Jamie?

01:07.320 --> 01:08.320
Happy.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.320
Happy.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.880
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.880
Bleh.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
All right.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.720
Joining us in just a few moments is Techmaster Loki.

01:15.720 --> 01:20.120
He's a little late to studio tonight, I'm literally listening to him walk in right this

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
second.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.720
I'd like to hear a little more about that excuse as to why he's getting situated right

01:25.720 --> 01:26.720
now.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.720
We'll come back to him in a minute.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.720
Saints Row.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.720
That's why.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.720
Really?

01:30.720 --> 01:31.720
Really?

01:31.720 --> 01:32.720
You stood the show up for Saints Row.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.720
Are you surprised?

01:33.720 --> 01:34.720
Actually, no.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
Not at all.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.920
Well, welcome, Techmaster Loki.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.720
Let me introduce chat while you get situated real quick.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.040
We are, of course, the show where every gamer has a voice, and we always invite your voices

01:43.040 --> 01:44.280
via email.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.280
And seriously, we need more voices via email.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.280
Is it true?

01:47.280 --> 01:48.280
No emails tonight?

01:48.280 --> 01:52.040
I think everybody's too busy playing Skyrim and Modern Warfare and all that stuff.

01:52.040 --> 01:57.040
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, the Twitter, of course, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and our

01:57.040 --> 01:59.560
chat room, our live chat room, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.080
Oh, yeah, I forgot to load chat.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
Sorry, guys.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.800
You might want to log into chat.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.720
Actually, just before we got started with the show tonight, Amiga777 was wondering why

02:09.720 --> 02:11.000
is attendance this low?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.960
I guess our chat room is a little bit emptier than it usually is right now.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.560
And I would say it's probably all the crazy games that are out, and it's a busy time of

02:19.560 --> 02:20.560
year.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.120
Technically, it's not the holidays yet, but let me give you this.

02:24.120 --> 02:28.400
I went to the mall yesterday, and it was a madhouse, absolute madhouse.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.560
I would have thought yesterday was the weekend after Thanksgiving.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.840
It was that crowded.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.960
So maybe that's a good sign that the economy is coming back, or maybe people just want

02:38.960 --> 02:42.360
to get out and get their shopping done before all the craziness hits.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.360
I don't know.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.040
This is why I don't go to the mall at all this time of year.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.960
I can't say I blame you, but that's where my haircut place is, so I had to go over there,

02:50.960 --> 02:52.720
and there were other errands I wanted to do.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.040
So what can you do?

02:56.040 --> 02:59.440
Let's also introduce the chat room.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.280
We're going to get to the Skype calls a little later on.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
Let me talk about this.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.760
Speaking of deals, I wanted to start off with a discussion on this real quick, and that

03:05.760 --> 03:08.800
is the Black Friday stuff that's starting to hit the internet.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.360
And if you don't know what Black Friday is, I don't know what hole you've been living

03:12.360 --> 03:13.680
in, but maybe you don't live in the US.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
That could be it, too.

03:14.680 --> 03:19.480
Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving here in the US, and it's usually a day that's

03:19.480 --> 03:24.760
kind of the unofficial official kickoff to the holiday shopping season, and things get

03:24.760 --> 03:27.200
discounted like crazy.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.800
And some of the Black Friday ads are starting to leak out there on the internet, and you

03:31.800 --> 03:36.720
kind of have to take a lot of what you read on the internet with a grain of salt.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.880
But a website that's very respected and reputable within the gaming community, CheapAssGamer

03:41.880 --> 03:46.000
at CheapAssGamer.com, is compiling some of the better deals that are going on right now.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.360
Now, I'm not going to plagiarize and read the entire list.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.480
If you want to read that, you can go to their website, but I'll give you kind of some of

03:51.480 --> 03:53.360
the highlights that I'm seeing here.

03:53.360 --> 03:59.000
A lot of the consoles appear to be deeply discounted, including it looks like Target

03:59.000 --> 04:05.480
is selling an Xbox 360 console for $139, the 4 gig console.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.520
That's very inexpensive considering that guy is what, usually about $199?

04:09.520 --> 04:11.360
That's a very deep discount.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.160
PlayStation 3 seems to be $199 most places, probably the cheapest place is Walmart by

04:17.160 --> 04:21.480
a whole 2 cents, but Best Buy and Radio Shack are deeply discounting that as well.

04:21.480 --> 04:28.680
The Wii is down to $100, 3DS going down to $179.99, that's a bundle pack going on there.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.360
I was going to say, because that's not a discount at all.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.080
Right, but it's a bundle pack with a game.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.280
And let's see, discounts on games.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.280
Current games.

04:37.280 --> 04:45.520
Batman Arkham City, going to be $28 at Walmart, $29 at Best Buy, Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, it's

04:45.520 --> 04:49.320
still $60 but you can get a $10 gift card at Target.

04:49.320 --> 04:55.840
Gears of War 3 for $28 at Walmart, Need for Speed The Run, $30 at Best Buy.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.040
Some pretty good deals throughout there.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.720
And again, that list I was reading from is just CheapAssGamer.com, they have a little

05:02.720 --> 05:04.920
compilation going on there.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.680
That's their specialty, is looking at game deals.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.440
But I wanted to kind of ask the folks at the studio here, do you get excited about Black

05:12.440 --> 05:13.440
Friday?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.440
Is that something you think you might participate in for some of these deals?

05:15.440 --> 05:18.280
Or are you like, hell no, get me the hell away from those stores.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
No.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.280
No?

05:20.280 --> 05:22.560
I don't have anything I don't already want.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.360
So if you want something, you just go get it.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.280
Having gone out to stores on Black Friday before?

05:26.280 --> 05:28.080
No, I'll be staying inside.

05:28.080 --> 05:34.360
I mean, really, I can get just as good deals online.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.600
And I know people who are going.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.400
So if they're going to be there anyway, I just say, okay, you do this for me.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.800
Besides, it's all about Cyber Monday.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.360
Cyber Monday, I don't have to go anywhere.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.580
I just sit down and deals come to me.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.580
That's true.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.000
I'm a little more into the Cyber Monday.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.760
I have never gone out on Black Friday, but some of these deals, I don't know, they have

05:52.760 --> 05:54.880
me thinking there's some good game prices.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
You know who doesn't last?

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
Steam.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
I'm looking forward to Steam.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, I was going to say, Cyber Monday, that's a big Steam thing right there.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.720
That day is going to hurt on Steam, that's for sure.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
Anyway.

06:05.720 --> 06:12.440
But I mean, really, the only things that I could possibly want slash need is I'd like

06:12.440 --> 06:13.820
a new laptop.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.080
That's about it.

06:15.080 --> 06:19.100
I would like for my current computer to not be a piece of shit, which it won't be once

06:19.100 --> 06:24.560
I put Windows 7 and Linux Mint on it because that's coming soon.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.560
I was surprised.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.480
You told me the other day you were still running Vista and I was like, oh, poor thing.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.560
Because I've had problems going on.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.880
But I mean, right now, honestly, given my situation, I'm just lucky to have a roof over

06:34.880 --> 06:36.080
my head.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.440
I'm happy to have food to eat.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.360
I'm happy to have stuff to wear.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
So quite honestly...

06:42.360 --> 06:43.840
You're being very zen about the whole thing.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.480
You're just very like, you know, I don't need material possessions.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.080
Well, it's not really so much of a that.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.440
It's just that having been slapped in my, you know, in the face with the possibility

06:55.440 --> 06:59.080
of maybe being homeless or having nothing to eat.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.080
You're not going to be homeless.

07:00.080 --> 07:06.520
But it's sort, it's sort of realigned my, um, my values, I guess.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.520
My perspective.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.520
Yeah, I gotcha.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.880
I used to really dread turning 30, but then when I was really sick in 2008, which you

07:11.880 --> 07:16.280
guys might remember, like I was like, hey, turning 30 is awesome because I actually live

07:16.280 --> 07:17.280
to be 30.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.000
Life is actually better once you're 30 too.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
It really is.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.560
But anyway, that's, that's, that's for another, that's for the zen show, which will be our

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
third podcast.

07:25.560 --> 07:30.040
But I mean, seriously, it was just sort of like, you know, if, if I want to, if I want

07:30.040 --> 07:33.560
these games, I can rent them if I really want to play it.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.800
You know, I've got tons of games that I've, you know, hardly played.

07:37.800 --> 07:44.080
I've just, um, uh, started project diva, which is fun.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.840
Well, we'll get into that in a minute during gaming weeks, but let me go to some of the

07:46.840 --> 07:49.840
comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandrady.com.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.760
Hitstun says, I get roughly half my Christmas shopping done on black Friday.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.480
Salacious Pop says, fuck the mall, seriously, maybe fries.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.760
It's the only in real life store I'd go to.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.760
That's, that's the worst.

08:00.760 --> 08:05.480
Do you not go to fries and black Friday if you want to go to fries and watch the guy

08:05.480 --> 08:10.720
walking around with like a balloon that says line ends here and then you watch it snake

08:10.720 --> 08:11.720
through the entire store.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.640
Yeah, I did that one time cause I, I think it was actually living with you at the time.

08:15.640 --> 08:19.520
Yeah, I think I was buying like a replacement motherboard or something cause my computer

08:19.520 --> 08:24.760
had died and, and I went there and that line took like an hour and a half to go through

08:24.760 --> 08:25.760
black again.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.680
Actually, I have gone out at black Friday, but I went out like right before the store's

08:29.680 --> 08:33.040
closed when it's more normal, like everybody's gone.

08:33.040 --> 08:36.320
Granted, you won't get some of the deep, deep deals at that time cause a lot of stuff is

08:36.320 --> 08:38.640
sold out, but there's still a lot of good stuff on the shelves.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.400
It's not like everything is suddenly missing from the shelves when you go there.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.400
So I don't know.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.840
I've seen some good deals then.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.440
Um, let's see.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.520
Act Def says, I got my dream cast for $50 on a black Friday sale.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
That's pretty awesome.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.080
A game grew says, I got my 360 on a black Friday a few years back.

08:55.080 --> 09:00.560
Uh, Eric K says, I black Friday on Amazon and Amiga seven, seven, seven says, what's

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
a fries?

09:01.560 --> 09:02.560
And that's right.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.560
They don't have them everywhere.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.120
It's think, uh, like a best buy.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.720
That's like three times as big.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.920
That's kind of what a fries is.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.360
This sells, you know, a lot of electronic and appliances and all that.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.240
That's pretty much what a fries is, right?

09:13.240 --> 09:14.240
So a lot of good deals.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.080
They sell a lot more components than a bad really crappy toys that you don't need.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.520
All right.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.760
And food like nerd food.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.760
That's that's the other weird thing.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.320
Yeah, astronaut ice cream.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.800
Best Buy does kind of have that though.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.880
They have like the movie food at their counter.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.880
So whatever.

09:29.880 --> 09:30.880
Anyway.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.880
All right.

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
That's comments from our chat.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.240
Not only can you get your, you know, games and stuff like that, you can get stuff to

09:36.240 --> 09:44.400
outfit a convenience store, including a, um, cotton candy maker, a hot dog, um, cooker

09:44.400 --> 09:46.080
and uh, all sorts of things.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
Yeah.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.080
Just random stuff.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.680
Not that I've ever bought any of that shit at fries, but I've thought about it.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.840
I'm like, did you get your deep fryer at fries?

09:53.840 --> 09:54.840
No, that was a Christmas gift.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
That's right.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.840
That's right.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
All right.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.840
Another one, but the wife won't let me.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.840
All right.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.640
Anyhow, uh, we're going to go on and, uh, talk about our gaming weeks and the types

10:02.640 --> 10:04.560
of video games that we have been playing this week.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.800
Um, we'll start off with dark soccer.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.320
I know you mentioned project diva.

10:07.320 --> 10:12.480
Yeah, I will have started it and then remembered that I had to write a research paper.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.840
So I turned it off.

10:13.840 --> 10:21.160
I'm trying to actually find the, um, our, uh, charger for our PSP so that I can, um,

10:21.160 --> 10:24.600
take it with me to school, but it's, it's cute.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
Very pretty.

10:25.600 --> 10:32.600
And, um, I played some well, I'm almost level 60 from on gyaru.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.840
That's the one in the Horde house Guild, right?

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
Yeah.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.840
The one in the courthouse Guild.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.840
Good times.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
I'm really enjoying priests.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.120
I never thought I would really like it, which I should plug that on this show, like our

10:41.120 --> 10:42.120
Horde house Guild.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.560
And of course there's a spinoff show that I host, um, the best little Horde house in

10:45.560 --> 10:48.400
Azeroth at Horde house.com, which is the Warcraft show.

10:48.400 --> 10:52.080
Dark soccer has been a guest several times, but usually it's my co-host is a guy named

10:52.080 --> 10:53.560
Exifer who's very vulgar.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.000
Well, it's an explicit show, uh, but it's fun.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.800
And uh, we play on the drendon server Horde side in a Guild called the best little Horde

11:02.800 --> 11:05.640
house and we are in, or no best little Horde house.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.640
It's in the Guild finder.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.080
Very easy to find.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.000
And um, yeah, you can play with dark soccer and I know you could just ask my druid is

11:12.000 --> 11:16.320
there gordita, but you need to come back and we need to do pally pals.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
Yeah.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.320
We were having fun with Rob.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.760
Rob and I have paladins that look oddly related.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.280
I have a paladin named diabetes.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.560
Mine's named Sylviara, but I actually tried to make a decent name.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.960
I could have named her cotton candy.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.220
I decided since they weren't going to give me the walrus people so I could have a walrus

11:34.220 --> 11:35.400
named diabetes.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.240
I guess I'll just have a paladin.

11:37.240 --> 11:44.840
I made you a Tuscar in the, um, the, the, uh, model viewer named Wilford.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.640
I made it an honor of you.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.640
Nice.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.320
I'm laughing at the salacious pop in our chat room that says Rob is going to come home with

11:51.320 --> 11:52.800
a churro machine now.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.120
Do they sell those at fries?

11:54.120 --> 11:56.000
Cause if so, that's on my holiday list.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.080
You know, I don't know, but I'm serious to go over there.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.280
It's the imply.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.820
It's part of the appliance section, at least in our local one over here in Roseville goddamn

12:04.820 --> 12:05.820
churro machine.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.160
Do you know how popular I'd be?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.840
It's like, I'd be like having Disneyland in my house.

12:09.840 --> 12:15.960
I live in the cat bathroom so I could always have, if they have a slurpee machine there,

12:15.960 --> 12:17.600
I will have a slurpee machine anyway.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.600
I know what I'm getting.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.600
You Rob.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.600
Sorry.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.480
It's more of a gift for, for salacious pop.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
Oh wait.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.760
Why would you get me a gift for him?

12:24.760 --> 12:25.880
Because you'll benefit from it.

12:25.880 --> 12:26.880
Okay.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.880
Oh, I see.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.120
It's something where it's like, it'll keep him busy so I can do what I want.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.120
No.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.120
Okay.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
All right.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.120
Anyhow, back to games you've been playing.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.120
Wow.

12:36.120 --> 12:39.760
Um, I really haven't had a whole lot of time for games.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.480
As I said last week, we were, we, uh, had to finish compiling the magazine this week.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.960
So most of my time has been spent at school.

12:46.960 --> 12:53.760
Um, so I did like a little bit of flash gaming and rearranged my entire portable hard drive,

12:53.760 --> 12:58.880
uh, because, uh, I was hanging out with the art director while he was finishing the compiling

12:58.880 --> 13:01.160
and I had to do last minute corrections and stuff.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.200
Um, that's all done.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.200
Hopefully we go to print.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.040
Um, I think tomorrow or Tuesday.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.080
So now that that's done, now my research papers written, I won't have to hear you talk about

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
it anymore.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
Yay.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.120
I'm expecting everyone to buy an issue.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
Seriously.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.120
I will.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.540
You'll have my eternal gratitude if you buy an issue of the American river review and

13:19.540 --> 13:20.840
can see all my gorgeous work.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.840
That's okay.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
I have enough issues already.

13:22.840 --> 13:23.840
You've got subscriptions.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.320
What are you talking about?

13:26.320 --> 13:27.920
But I'm running low on toilet paper.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.320
Dan finished Arkham city.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.320
Oh yeah.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.040
And he finished all the missions.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.040
Nice.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
Has he found every, every Riddler trophy?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.120
I doubt it.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.360
He has found enough to find Riddler.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.360
Nice.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.600
So he beat Riddler, which is kind of a let down.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.600
Really?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
I mean, it's funny.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.440
I have to say Riddler sets off my Gator.

13:48.440 --> 13:52.840
Riddler is kind of like, it's going to sound really weird, but Riddler's kind of hot.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.280
Like it depends on which Riddler we're talking about.

13:55.280 --> 14:00.120
This Riddler is like, not so much like Frank Gorshin Riddler from sixties Batman, but I'm

14:00.120 --> 14:05.040
talking like when they tried to make Riddler very Metro sexual, I was going to say Metro,

14:05.040 --> 14:07.920
but he sets off, but he actually does set off my Gator.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.920
All right.

14:08.920 --> 14:14.180
This is the first time I've ever had a character in a game set off my infallible Gator.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.600
It's the greatest question of all.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.360
Yeah.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.680
And then Dan did the whole thing with Catwoman.

14:20.680 --> 14:24.680
You know, when you go back to help Batman instead, he did the thing where she leaves

14:24.680 --> 14:25.800
him.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.280
I don't know that part yet, so you better not be spoiling her.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.280
I'll come over there and kick your butt.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.280
It's just funny.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.320
You should do it at least once cause you can, you can go back and fix it.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.760
But I hear story mode is actually not that long.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.760
All things considered.

14:36.760 --> 14:41.440
No, the, the, the primary missions are really not that long, but there's so much else to

14:41.440 --> 14:42.440
do.

14:42.440 --> 14:48.040
Like the hush ones are really cool because I'm not a big Batman reader.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.600
You know, I don't like DC comics, but I read my, one of my favorite Batman things I've

14:52.600 --> 14:55.200
ever read was heart of hush.

14:55.200 --> 15:01.200
And that was a really good actual Batman Catwoman story.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.120
And I kind of like the dynamic that the two have in the game.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.600
Do you know why I love Batman?

15:05.600 --> 15:09.760
And it's, it's not, I'm actually not a big comic reader, although I don't know, like

15:09.760 --> 15:14.140
I'm sitting here reading comic, funny enough salacious pop, but we, we went to a brand

15:14.140 --> 15:17.480
new comic book store out in a Thomas, like some brand new place that just opened up like

15:17.480 --> 15:20.560
a month ago and he bought the killing joke.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.560
The killing joke is very good.

15:22.560 --> 15:26.720
And so I was thinking I might steal that and read it because I don't use, I'm not like

15:26.720 --> 15:27.720
a comic reader.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.720
It's not that I dislike them.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
I just, I don't know.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
It's a fucked up story.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
Yeah, I know.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.720
I know.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.560
But like the reason why I love Batman so much is not just the movies, which were brilliant,

15:35.560 --> 15:40.840
but seriously growing up, I think I saw every single episode of the old Batman series from

15:40.840 --> 15:42.040
the sixties with Adam West.

15:42.040 --> 15:46.200
No, I did not grow up in the sixties, but they reran them all the time.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.600
But Julie Newmar was my hero.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
Oh, she's great.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.960
And it's really sad that they don't rerun them now.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.480
I think they do, but it's on a very obscure network.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.480
It's not like it's on FX anymore.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.800
You can still find it somewhere.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.800
That's right there.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.720
Perfect adult swim material, I'm telling you.

16:01.720 --> 16:08.520
But it's just, I like all the nods to, and even someone like me who isn't totally into

16:08.520 --> 16:13.200
Batman, like there's a few characters in there that I know they're Batman characters, but

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
I don't know who they are.

16:14.200 --> 16:19.500
Like I knew Solomon Grundy was a Batman character, but I had no idea who exactly he was.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.920
For me, I love the art and the game.

16:21.920 --> 16:27.040
So I've just been sitting there watching him because I'm looking at the scenery.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.600
And for me, like my favorite places when they go, I don't know if you've been there yet,

16:30.600 --> 16:34.720
but the Wonder City underground, the sunken streets.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.460
I've been in a subway system underground.

16:37.460 --> 16:42.880
Under the subway, closer to where Wonder Tower is, you can go underground and it's like this

16:42.880 --> 16:48.440
World's Fair exhibition, but it's all these city streets, like little, you know, with

16:48.440 --> 16:50.640
buggies and everything, only it's all torn up.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.360
But a lot of the artwork in there is very Art Nouveau.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.800
I'm up to the, just to give you an idea where I'm at in the story, keep in mind, I have

16:56.800 --> 17:00.560
done some of the side quests, like some of the Zazz stuff, which that guy's scary.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.160
But okay, was it just me or does the voice sound like a woman at first?

17:04.160 --> 17:06.160
He just sounds like he has a problem.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.040
But he sounded like a woman.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
You want to give him a hug, but you don't.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.800
I'll carve your name into my skin.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.600
You put the notion in the basket.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.240
The chat room is reminding us that they do rerun them on the hub.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.680
Okay, the hub.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
Is that really, okay.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
There you go.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
All right.

17:22.680 --> 17:26.320
But anyway, I was going to say, I am at the point in the game, I'm in the museum and-

17:26.320 --> 17:27.640
So you're hunting penguin.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.640
Sort of.

17:28.640 --> 17:33.240
We just kicked some of his henchman's ass and then we were at this part with boats and

17:33.240 --> 17:34.720
you're having to use the grappling hook to-

17:34.720 --> 17:35.720
That's annoying.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
Oh my God.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.720
I was so frustrated.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.880
Do you know how many times I've been eaten by a shark?

17:39.880 --> 17:43.200
And you know how many more times you're going to have to do shit like that in the game?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
Ugh.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.440
Wait, wait, so you get-

17:45.440 --> 17:46.440
Otherwise I love it.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.240
Wait, so you get the cryo bomb.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
All right.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
Cause you-

17:50.240 --> 17:51.240
Can't wait.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.240
All right.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.240
You throw it in the water.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.240
Or else it gets the hose again.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
You know what though?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.080
You know what we want to know what's really annoying is going and trying to do all that

17:58.080 --> 18:00.080
shit with Catwoman.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.840
But keep in mind, she can climb on the ceiling.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.000
Dude, the Catwoman parts are my favorite so far.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Like that part-

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I love her whip.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.240
Her and Poison Ivy, she's so much fun to battle with.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
Anyway, sorry.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.480
That's, that's, that's hotness.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.480
Her and Poison Ivy.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.480
She is, she is pretty hot.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.840
In fact, I think in the chat room, Tiger Claw asked hotter than Catwoman, I think in reference

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
to my Riddler reference.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.960
Oh, I mean, it kind of depends on what you're into, but you know, I'm very secure in my

18:21.960 --> 18:25.560
homosexuality when I say this, Catwoman has a nice rack.

18:25.560 --> 18:30.240
It's, it's the, uh, the new style Catwoman too.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.480
So she's probably fucking Batman.

18:33.480 --> 18:39.320
Like any minute that, that zipper's just going to fly open and go woohoo.

18:39.320 --> 18:43.960
So yeah, so while I haven't been playing it, I've really been getting into it.

18:43.960 --> 18:49.240
Um, just like I said, for me, it's going around and looking at everything and really taking

18:49.240 --> 18:53.480
in the scenery and Dan will actually just stop and go exploring places for me so I can

18:53.480 --> 18:54.480
see it.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.480
All right.

18:55.480 --> 18:56.480
That's fun.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.480
So it's pretty cool.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.600
The other night I was playing with a group of friends and they were like, go in the place

18:58.600 --> 18:59.760
that says live nude girls.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.040
There's a place that says live nude girls, go in the door.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
There's two signs.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.040
Live nude girls.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
Yeah.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.040
I think you can go in there.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.040
Yeah.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
The door was locked.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
I'm assuming maybe it comes into play later.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.760
I really, oh really?

19:10.760 --> 19:13.920
I assumed it was a Riddler room that came up later or something.

19:13.920 --> 19:19.200
Some of those, some of the speculation Riddler room wouldn't be at live nude girls.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.200
Yeah.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.200
Yeah.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
Oh my.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.680
His little hideout by the way is fucking sadistic.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.680
I love it.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.920
So, um, but yeah, tiger class says, you know, you can punch the shark.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.920
Really?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.880
I'm going to do that next time.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.000
I'm going to tell Dan to go punch the shark.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I'm going to shoot him in the face.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.480
You cannot jump it.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.640
Anyhow, so you need to move on.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.640
Sorry.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.600
So really the, that's been what my gaming week has been.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.920
Um, I'm planning on, uh, now that I've got my research paper done, I've got like one

19:48.920 --> 19:52.440
more paper that I've got to do with my group, but we're review, we have to pick a piece

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
of art.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.440
So we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.440
Good times.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.640
Cause we, cause half the group's like into, into modern, you know, movies and stuff.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.640
And he said, we could do a movie.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.840
So I was like, we're going to do a Rocky shit.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.120
So they were coming over Tuesday to do the time warp.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.120
Good times.

20:08.120 --> 20:12.640
And, um, so when that's all done, I'm going to play the shit out of Project Diva.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.680
All right.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.680
Hell yeah.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.880
All right, Loki, need I ask, how was your gaming week?

20:19.880 --> 20:23.000
Um, very fulfilling.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.080
Not play a lot of things this week, actually.

20:25.080 --> 20:29.600
Uh, of course, Grand Theft Auto, um, which is kind of funny because Grand Theft Auto,

20:29.600 --> 20:36.880
I think we're, uh, transitioning onto a new game after seven years or so.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.760
Gee, what could that possibly be?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.280
Call of Duty, modern warfare.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
What?

20:43.280 --> 20:45.360
I thought for sure you were going to say Saints Row.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.560
No, it doesn't have multiplayer in it.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.120
No death match in it.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
Oh, really?

20:50.120 --> 20:51.840
It has co-op, but not death match.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.840
Yes.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
Oh, okay.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
Okay.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.840
So wait a minute.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
Wait a minute.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.840
Wait a minute.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.840
Okay.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.840
So now you're, you're all about Call of Duty, modern warfare, like three, the new one.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
No one.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.600
Well, Call of Duty for modern warfare.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.600
Oh, okay.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.560
So that one, because it's cheap, you know, you have to buy five copies.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.560
I see.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.800
So you're starting with the, you know, one you could get for $9.99 these days and exactly

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
so.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.260
So that's what we're playing.

21:16.260 --> 21:19.760
And the only reason that they're switching to it is because they got tired of me beating

21:19.760 --> 21:21.120
them.

21:21.120 --> 21:26.260
And I'm happy to report that our first game that we played on it, I nearly, well, I doubled

21:26.260 --> 21:30.840
second place's scores, so, uh, I'm still going to beat them in this game.

21:30.840 --> 21:34.080
So I don't know what the point was in switching, but whatever.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.080
They want to mix it up.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.560
I have an important news flash.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.560
What?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.560
Dan brought me pizza.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.560
Did he bring me pizza?

21:40.560 --> 21:41.560
You can get some.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.560
I'm just kidding.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.560
I'll wait.

21:43.560 --> 21:48.800
Um, and then other than that, let's see, I played Zelda, the four swords adventure on,

21:48.800 --> 21:54.120
um, the 3DS or DS, I guess it's off of the store.

21:54.120 --> 21:59.480
Um, it's all right, but I think definitely more of a game for more than one person and

21:59.480 --> 22:01.920
not too fun playing it by herself.

22:01.920 --> 22:08.400
And um, I don't know, it's all right, but yeah, definitely more fun with more people.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
And then, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.640
I played saints for the third, which is just amazing.

22:11.640 --> 22:18.180
Um, I'm actually about 13 hours into it already and it's just great.

22:18.180 --> 22:22.400
It's every bit of awesome that I wanted it to be.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.400
It is.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.240
And then some, there's gotta be something negative, something you're not happy about.

22:27.240 --> 22:33.600
Ah, the escort missions are still annoying because the AI is still kind of eh.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.960
It's a little bit glitchy now and then, but not anything that really hurts the game.

22:36.960 --> 22:37.960
Just like funny stuff.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.080
Like I'll finish a tank mission or something and when I'm done there's corpses stuck in

22:42.080 --> 22:46.320
the ground and you can walk up to them and they kind of like bounce around back and forth

22:46.320 --> 22:47.320
and stuff.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.480
It's the same shit that's funny in Skyrim.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.280
Like mammoths just randomly falling from the sky and all that.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.280
Just random stuff.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.640
And that's fine, you know, the games, I expect that game to be slightly buggy because that's

22:56.640 --> 22:58.760
how Singing Spyro is.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.640
It's just slightly buggy and it's fine.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.640
It makes it more funny.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.880
I gotta say though, the missions are great.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.220
Just what I've played so far.

23:09.220 --> 23:17.560
They have some really good kind of direction to them and there's even some that have kind

23:17.560 --> 23:22.200
of music that plays along with it that's just really awesome.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.120
It just sets the mood so well.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.020
How does the game, like, you know, keep in mind I haven't played a lot of the Saints

23:27.020 --> 23:28.020
Row games.

23:28.020 --> 23:33.160
I played the first one for like an hour, but like, how does it transition from all these

23:33.160 --> 23:37.400
bits of randomness one to another because isn't it a very open world game and like when

23:37.400 --> 23:41.360
I started seeing all this stuff like that there's Tron's parodies in it and all these

23:41.360 --> 23:45.560
things I was like how do they, how do they work that all into the game?

23:45.560 --> 23:48.400
How does it go from one parody to another?

23:48.400 --> 23:53.220
It works really well actually and like the very beginning, the first few missions, actually

23:53.220 --> 23:54.240
quite a bit of the missions.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.160
I think I was up through 20% of the game and it was still doing tutorial missions I guess

23:59.160 --> 24:04.840
to kind of introduce you to the different activities that you can do in the game.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.400
And um, you know, it's really strange sometimes.

24:08.400 --> 24:18.320
Like for example, there's one that you're being trained by, by this one Saint that you

24:18.320 --> 24:25.520
pick up who's voiced by Hulk Hogan and he's training you to be able to confront Kilbane

24:25.520 --> 24:31.280
who's this luchador, the leader of the luchador gang or whatever in there and stuff.

24:31.280 --> 24:38.280
And so it's almost like a little bit of Karate Kid sort of and it's great because one of

24:38.280 --> 24:42.160
the songs in the game is the best from Karate Kid.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.400
You're the best around.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.400
Yes exactly.

24:47.400 --> 24:52.560
And they actually have that in the part when you first talk to the guy and stuff.

24:52.560 --> 24:58.160
So he's having you feel pain so one of the missions that you do, it's basically an activity.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.960
So there's lots of pop culture references left and right essentially.

25:01.960 --> 25:07.960
It's not all pop culture references, I mean it's just really over the top.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.700
Just very big action sequences.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.200
How many people have you slapped in the face of the dildo?

25:12.200 --> 25:13.200
I don't know.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.640
But I think it keeps the stats for that.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.640
You lost count.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.380
I mean come on.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.380
This game has...

25:20.380 --> 25:21.760
How many whores have you killed?

25:21.760 --> 25:22.760
I don't know.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.200
I don't think I've killed that many whores.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.360
There aren't that many whores.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.720
There's some strange shit, okay?

25:26.720 --> 25:31.360
Like seriously, you'll be walking around all of a sudden, you know, there's gimps walking

25:31.360 --> 25:35.480
around and then these furries walking around, it's like what the hell is going on?

25:35.480 --> 25:41.220
Today, and I think this is an Easter egg, today I ran across, you know, Genki, the cathead

25:41.220 --> 25:46.600
guy that's running this Japanese game show or whatever, the mascot for this game almost

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
died.

25:47.600 --> 25:52.640
All of a sudden, I see him running around the street shooting people with rocket launchers.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.520
What the fuck is he doing out here?

25:54.520 --> 26:00.200
And so I went to go try to kill him, and I did manage to kill him finally, but it took

26:00.200 --> 26:01.200
a lot.

26:01.200 --> 26:07.160
I think it glitched him underneath a dump truck or something that crushed him to death.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.880
Kaijuto in our chat room is asking, Loki, did they fix the camera and the driving in

26:10.880 --> 26:12.040
Saints 3?

26:12.040 --> 26:15.120
The bad camera and the bad driving killed Saints 2 for me.

26:15.120 --> 26:22.040
Yes, they fixed the driving, the driving is awesome, really, really fun.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.640
Camera I didn't really have a problem with the camera in 3, so I didn't notice if the

26:25.640 --> 26:29.720
camera is, I think it's fixed, I mean, like I said, I don't have any problems with it,

26:29.720 --> 26:30.860
but the driving is great.

26:30.860 --> 26:33.100
So there's no real multiplayer in this?

26:33.100 --> 26:39.400
It's co-op, you can do co-op campaign, and then you can also do horde mode, which is,

26:39.400 --> 26:42.520
you know, the really ridiculous stuff.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.200
You get to be the whore, right?

26:44.200 --> 26:50.280
No, it's just a horde mode, some waves have whores in them, some of them you're shrunken

26:50.280 --> 26:56.000
down really small, some of them you're really big, just ridiculous stuff.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.400
I'm trying to think of some really strange stuff.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.400
Oh, I have a gun now that I can fire at a car that allows me to control it like an RC

27:02.400 --> 27:03.880
car, which is kind of fun.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.040
Wow, that sounds like Driver.

27:07.040 --> 27:12.960
You have parachutes that you can use whenever, so you can just skydive off a building.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.320
You should have wingsuits.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.080
They don't have any wingsuits, unfortunately.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.220
Are you having a lot of fun?

27:18.220 --> 27:21.480
It sounds to me like you're just able to sandbox.

27:21.480 --> 27:29.280
It's great, it's seriously a fun, fun game, you know, yeah, I mean, I'm going to be playing

27:29.280 --> 27:32.440
it right here in the show, a little bit.

27:32.440 --> 27:36.800
All right, anything else to say on Saints Row for now?

27:36.800 --> 27:41.280
Definitely pick it up, it's a great game, I mean, it's worth it, and I've seen some

27:41.280 --> 27:47.280
of the reviewers bitching about how the missions were very linear, dude, it's a mission, it's

27:47.280 --> 27:49.280
supposed to be linear.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.320
I don't understand what they're looking for.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.960
There's just so many games out right now, like, I can't pick up Saints Row right now,

27:54.960 --> 27:57.160
there's too much, too much!

27:57.160 --> 28:01.720
All right, going to my gaming week, I played more Batman Arkham City, which I guess I've

28:01.720 --> 28:05.960
already dished on with Jamie a little bit, but I'm just having fun just exploring some

28:05.960 --> 28:09.280
of the side missions and trying to do the main stuff as well, and you know, I already

28:09.280 --> 28:13.520
talked about where I was at in the game, and it's great, I'm loving that game, it's truly

28:13.520 --> 28:17.940
one of the best of the year, it really is, and that's so not the type of game I usually

28:17.940 --> 28:23.080
get into, but it's just, a good game is a good game, it transcends that.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.960
One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, I'm sure will come as no surprise

28:25.960 --> 28:27.200
to anyone, Skyrim.

28:27.200 --> 28:32.400
I picked up on Friday, had it delivered on release day, I've been playing Skyrim quite

28:32.400 --> 28:37.460
a bit since Friday, and you know, it's very similar to Oblivion, where you can, once you

28:37.460 --> 28:40.820
do the very first quest in the beginning, you can pretty much go out in the world and

28:40.820 --> 28:45.920
do whatever you want, and I think that openness really turns some people off.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.860
And I was really giving this some thought earlier today, it's really funny because we

28:48.860 --> 28:53.440
consider Oblivion a role-playing game, and we consider the Final Fantasy series a role-playing

28:53.440 --> 28:56.680
game, when in reality, the two could not be any more different.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.920
Those games are so, so different.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.060
I mean seriously, put them side by side.

29:01.060 --> 29:04.760
Final Fantasy XIII, criticized by many for being too linear.

29:04.760 --> 29:09.360
I disagree, I think that was kind of a big part of Final Fantasy XIII, it was very, very

29:09.360 --> 29:10.360
story-driven.

29:10.360 --> 29:14.600
Skyrim, not linear whatsoever.

29:14.600 --> 29:19.000
I mean yes, there's a main quest, but there's about 11 billion other things you can do outside

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
that main quest.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.400
In fact, now there's this whole, it randomly generates quests.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.680
Is this like Fable?

29:24.680 --> 29:25.680
It's crazy.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.680
No, it's better than Fable, I'm sorry.

29:26.680 --> 29:31.800
I meant like, though, in terms of its exploration.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.720
I guess, yeah, because some of the more recent Fable games, you kind of go around and do

29:35.720 --> 29:38.120
whatever, but it's just even on a bigger scale.

29:38.120 --> 29:42.000
It's just I love the fact that in Skyrim, and they've been saying this a lot, you look

29:42.000 --> 29:45.240
at the top of a mountain, you can climb that mountain.

29:45.240 --> 29:48.240
And anywhere you look at from the top of that mountain, you can walk to.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.160
It might take you a while to get there, but you can do it.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.640
There might be some mammoths and giants in your way not wanting you to get there, but

29:52.640 --> 29:53.640
you can do it.

29:53.640 --> 29:59.720
And just so many randomly generated things that just kind of make you look away.

29:59.720 --> 30:05.040
And I think in that sense, you know, again, to compare with Final Fantasy 13, there sometimes

30:05.040 --> 30:06.960
is a bit of a grind to it.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.960
There's numbers.

30:07.960 --> 30:08.960
You want to out-level.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.400
And, you know, there is a lot of fun.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.480
I love Final Fantasy.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.480
I'm not dogging that at all.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.560
In fact, I think Final Fantasy 13 was really underrated by a lot of the gaming media.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.560
I think it's a great game.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.500
But Skyrim is just so different.

30:20.500 --> 30:24.300
But you can't approach Skyrim like you do a Final Fantasy game, or you're setting yourself

30:24.300 --> 30:25.480
up for trouble.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.760
And that can be really hard because there's a lot of people where it's like, I gotta do,

30:28.760 --> 30:32.440
and I gotta see everything in the game, and I gotta not screw this up because I want to

30:32.440 --> 30:33.440
get the perfect ending.

30:33.440 --> 30:37.940
And it's like, you can't have that in a game that is randomly generating quests.

30:37.940 --> 30:42.560
If you can't put that aside, you're gonna be in trouble.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.200
I saw some pretty funny videos for Skyrim.

30:45.200 --> 30:49.680
Because, you know, like, one of my favorite things about games is how they're slightly

30:49.680 --> 30:50.680
buggy.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.760
And Oblivion was slightly buggy and it was great.

30:52.760 --> 30:56.480
But I don't know if you've seen the video where you put a pot on someone's head.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.480
Yes.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
Yes.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
And you suddenly can't see.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
That's great.

31:00.480 --> 31:07.680
Which is funny, because in that video, I recognized it, I was like, oh, I did that guy's quest.

31:07.680 --> 31:12.440
By the way, spoiler, if you do his quest to get the dragon claw, you will actually complete

31:12.440 --> 31:14.320
a story quest ahead of time.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.880
Just throwing it out there.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.320
Pro tip from me.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.620
But anyway, it's a great game.

31:20.620 --> 31:24.040
It's gorgeous to look at.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.080
It's fun.

31:25.080 --> 31:28.880
You just log in, you can do whatever you want.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.560
There's so much to do.

31:30.560 --> 31:31.800
So much to explore.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.360
That sense of gratification.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.200
So many ways to develop your character.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.480
You don't pick a class anymore.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.120
You're not a wizard or a warrior or anything.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.340
It's just, if you happen to use swords a lot, you skill up in swords.

31:43.340 --> 31:46.880
If you happen to stealth around a lot, you sneak up, you level up in sneaking.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.000
I mean, it's just awesome.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.440
It builds the character as you play it, which is great.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.520
And then the constellation talentry system is great too.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.480
You can effectively make a battle mage.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.320
Yeah, that's actually what I'm playing right now, pretty much.

31:58.320 --> 32:01.000
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.240
Some of the very minor drawbacks I can think of, and like, you know, there are still some

32:06.240 --> 32:11.800
surprising bugs in the game, despite how polished it's, you know, supposed to be after five

32:11.800 --> 32:14.560
years of development, some very obvious bugs.

32:14.560 --> 32:20.400
Let me tell you, I'm going to say the most nitpicky, crazy thing about a game, like ever,

32:20.400 --> 32:23.600
that this seriously is something that I find a little odd.

32:23.600 --> 32:28.240
And believe it or not, this is something that's going to appeal to Dark Sakura.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.340
It's the design, the menu design.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.880
And this is going to be really nerdy.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.020
Like the nerdiest thing you're ever going to hear in a game reveal.

32:35.020 --> 32:41.500
I find the usage of a narrow sans serif font to be very strange and conflicting to the

32:41.500 --> 32:45.960
ambience of what these games are supposed to be about.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.640
You know, I am dead fucking serious.

32:48.640 --> 32:53.320
Like when I look at it, I'm like this, it has this very modern look to it, but I'm not

32:53.320 --> 32:54.460
playing Fallout.

32:54.460 --> 32:59.620
I'm playing, I'm not saying everything has to be scripty and ye olde and papyrus and

32:59.620 --> 33:00.620
all that garbage.

33:00.620 --> 33:01.620
I'm not saying that.

33:01.620 --> 33:04.720
I'm just like, it just looks very modern.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.440
You saw it, like I made you look at the interface, right?

33:06.440 --> 33:07.440
Yeah, I looked at it.

33:07.440 --> 33:11.120
It has a very modern look to it, which is weird.

33:11.120 --> 33:18.440
You know, for that type of game, I really would agree with you, except that the thinner,

33:18.440 --> 33:24.560
the, the, the, the light styles of sans serifs always make me think of a little bit of an

33:24.560 --> 33:31.680
ethereal quality, but I, I would have think that it should have been something a little

33:31.680 --> 33:33.100
bit more on the script side.

33:33.100 --> 33:37.120
It's also that it's the same font everywhere too, which is a little weird.

33:37.120 --> 33:41.480
It's like going to target and everything's set in Arial, not Arial, Helvetica.

33:41.480 --> 33:46.040
And you know me, I love Helvetica, but sometimes I'm sick of Helvetica, especially after looking

33:46.040 --> 33:48.060
at the damn magazine and everything's set in Helvetica.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.160
Sometimes you say to hell with Helvetica.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
To Helvetica.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
Yeah.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.160
Well I'll use Arial.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
Go to Helvetica.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.080
No, I'll use Arial when it snows in Helvetica.

33:56.080 --> 34:00.960
But like, well I don't know what the font is in Skyrim, but it's like an Arial narrow

34:00.960 --> 34:03.920
and it's like, you know, there's only so much of that I can take.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.160
You know what Arial is?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.160
What?

34:06.160 --> 34:07.160
Poor man's Helvetica.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
All right.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.160
Anyway.

34:09.160 --> 34:11.440
Well no, for serious, because Microsoft made that because they didn't want to pay for Helvetica.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.440
The end.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.440
It's the truth.

34:13.440 --> 34:17.460
Um, at least it's not like set in fucking comic sans or something.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.460
That's true.

34:18.460 --> 34:19.460
That's true.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.320
Or Papyrus is another gag me font.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.320
I know.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.320
I know.

34:23.320 --> 34:32.940
But it seemed the look of it made me think that it was a placeholder text and that they

34:32.940 --> 34:35.360
just didn't change it.

34:35.360 --> 34:39.800
Honestly, this is the most extreme nitpicky thing I have ever talked about in a video

34:39.800 --> 34:40.800
game.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.080
Otherwise the game is fantastic and do not let my bitching about the font deter your

34:45.080 --> 34:46.080
opinion.

34:46.080 --> 34:51.320
I don't really care for the, uh, the, the, the high renders of everything in the menu

34:51.320 --> 34:56.680
because if someone's running it on a PC, that's going to slow down their time runs pretty

34:56.680 --> 34:58.200
decent on most PCs.

34:58.200 --> 35:02.320
But um, the other thing I did think was weird was that I didn't like how there was like

35:02.320 --> 35:03.440
two different menus.

35:03.440 --> 35:08.320
Like there's one menu to bring up your quest log and stuff, but then there's another button

35:08.320 --> 35:12.120
you have to hit if you want your map or spells or the constellation.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.600
I kind of wish that had all been integrated into one menu.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.480
I thought that was kind of just odd.

35:16.480 --> 35:20.320
It felt really weird to play and I'm not sure why it was designed that way.

35:20.320 --> 35:24.340
I didn't like having two menus because I keep thinking that the map is in the start key

35:24.340 --> 35:25.340
and it's not.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.280
It's in the O or the circle.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.680
So this is weird.

35:28.680 --> 35:35.400
Um, uh, to, uh, answer, I wonder who persisted the IKEA font change.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.400
I did.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.780
IKEA always needs to use Futura forever.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.600
This is Typography Lounge Radio.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.600
All right.

35:43.600 --> 35:48.720
Look, I look, the game is fantastic, but it is a different type of role playing game.

35:48.720 --> 35:56.800
It's not for everybody, but if you, if you just, in some ways it's like an MMO where

35:56.800 --> 35:59.080
you don't have to deal with other people at all.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.080
That's awesome.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.920
It has that open world sense to it and there's so much that you can interact with and do

36:03.920 --> 36:09.520
in the whole like quests forever type of thing almost feels like an MMO, but without everything

36:09.520 --> 36:12.720
that people hate about MMOs, which is other people usually.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.200
So and a monthly fee.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.600
So but Skyrim is great.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.160
Great, great, great.

36:18.160 --> 36:21.000
Um, otherwise that's, that's been most of my week right there.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.840
Derek Tetsuya asks if it's time for the classic font of the week.

36:23.840 --> 36:27.280
I'm much more prone to use the word typeface.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.640
I think it sounds a little bit classier.

36:30.640 --> 36:34.120
Our comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com of course.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.120
All right.

36:35.120 --> 36:40.040
That's the, the typeface of the week is Adobe Caslon Pro.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.120
Stop.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.840
No one curr.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.160
All right.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.680
We're going to get into some gaming news tonight, of course, with you guys live in our chat

36:48.680 --> 36:51.840
room and the calls later on classic game of the week and all that stuff.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.840
First some other quick plugs.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.120
Again, if you're not already following us on Facebook, you should be facebook.com slash

36:56.120 --> 37:00.600
orangeloungeradio and we are on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash olr.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.720
We are also now on Google plus.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.800
We have a brand new Google plus page page.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.540
I know it's a reason to go back and look at Google plus, but um, here's what I really

37:08.540 --> 37:12.640
like about Google plus is that because thanks to the whole circle thing, we could actually

37:12.640 --> 37:17.520
post things on Google plus that only our listeners could see.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.520
So if we ever wanted to do like a secret club, we could post it on Google plus cause it wouldn't

37:21.520 --> 37:22.560
be public.

37:22.560 --> 37:26.040
So follow us on Google plus, put us in your circles over there.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.720
And uh, if any juicy gossip comes up, you know, in the next couple of months we will

37:29.720 --> 37:35.020
post it so that only the followers in our circles can see kind of like online only secret

37:35.020 --> 37:36.020
club.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.840
There's uh, information about the show and pictures and all that stuff.

37:38.840 --> 37:43.600
Uh, it's hard for me to give a URL to Google plus cause you can't have names yet, but just

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
search for us.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
Just type orange launch radio.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
We'll come right up.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.600
It's very easy to find.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.640
I'm sure somebody will link it in chat here in a minute.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.480
Uh, that's really it for housekeeping.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.720
So let's get into some news.

37:53.720 --> 37:54.720
Loki.

37:54.720 --> 38:03.380
So, um, you may remember DC universe, uh, online went free to play last week and already

38:03.380 --> 38:06.720
they've seen a huge increase in subscribers.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.720
No duh.

38:07.720 --> 38:14.280
Um, there are already up to a million subscribers and a million new players actually, and that's

38:14.280 --> 38:17.240
basically a 1000% increase.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.480
That's what happens when the game is free.

38:19.480 --> 38:25.160
Um, I'm kind of curious though, wonder how many of those are actually paying for parts

38:25.160 --> 38:30.040
of the game or just, you know, kind of like, you know, how I would probably be, would just

38:30.040 --> 38:31.600
say, I might want to try that out.

38:31.600 --> 38:37.040
Well, from what I understand, you can get upgrades to the game for only five bucks.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.080
Like there's two different levels.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.080
There's one where you can pay like a monthly fee and get all the good stuff.

38:41.080 --> 38:44.280
And then there's one where you just pay five bucks and you get a lot of little upgrades.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.680
That's kind of neat, I guess.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.680
That's not bad.

38:46.680 --> 38:47.680
That's not bad at all.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.040
Um, I actually watched a friend play DC universe on PS three and it's, it's kind of what I

38:51.040 --> 38:52.800
remember from the beta on PC.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.320
I don't know if it's, I just, I don't have the fucking time for another MMO right now

38:56.320 --> 38:58.120
with all the games out right now.

38:58.120 --> 39:04.240
Like, did you notice that none of us mentioned modern warfare three, like the biggest release

39:04.240 --> 39:07.000
effort in our gaming weeks at hall?

39:07.000 --> 39:11.400
Uh, not that that's the type of game I would usually play anyway, but I, I'm curious, like

39:11.400 --> 39:18.200
what makes this game so like, you know, desirable by so many people like the death match.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.760
Well, speaking of multiplayer, I would actually like to check out the, the halo anniversary

39:21.760 --> 39:22.760
edition at some point.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.920
I do like original OG halo.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.560
I'd like to check that out at some point.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.920
Um, I would like to play Mario three d land Mario kart seven.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.400
I don't know if you heard about the halo thing.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.600
You know, all those connect features are talking about.

39:33.600 --> 39:34.600
Yeah.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.600
Yeah.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.600
Not at lunch.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.800
They, they apparently are having trouble making them work.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.800
I'm like, really?

39:40.800 --> 39:46.460
You were having trouble making, you know, a voice command to change the resolution from

39:46.460 --> 39:52.120
original to like the new graphics or whatever, and also a voice command to throw a grenade.

39:52.120 --> 39:56.240
You couldn't make that work at all.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.240
Yeah.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
Grenade grenade.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
Damn it.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.240
It just, it doesn't understand certain accents.

40:02.240 --> 40:07.040
It's like, like you're saying grenade grenade.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.480
Did you say lemonade?

40:09.480 --> 40:11.360
Here's a fresh glass of lemonade.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.360
No grenade.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.820
Uh, yeah.

40:16.820 --> 40:20.240
So um, well I guess that that's good.

40:20.240 --> 40:24.400
Maybe some other MMOs Final Fantasy 14 should, uh, follow suit with that.

40:24.400 --> 40:28.920
Um, yeah, I think it's going to have to, I'm already over Final Fantasy 14.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.080
I haven't touched it in like two weeks.

40:31.080 --> 40:36.720
Well Final Fantasy 14 doesn't officially launch until I would like to see the whole 2.0, at

40:36.720 --> 40:40.960
least DC universe didn't have to launch a 2.0 you're just getting the game that everybody

40:40.960 --> 40:45.440
wanted to play, but no one wanted to pay 60 bucks and a monthly fee to play.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.440
I mean, no shit.

40:46.440 --> 40:49.400
They got a million people because like tons of people wanted to play this game, but they

40:49.400 --> 40:53.520
were like, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for it.

40:53.520 --> 40:59.640
There's only, there are so few games that can get away with charging what they do, especially

40:59.640 --> 41:02.000
in this day of 99 cent iPhone apps.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
It's crazy.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
All right.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.520
Well, I don't know how much they'll charge for this, but they could probably charge quite

41:07.520 --> 41:10.680
a bit and many people would still buy this to reminisce the past.

41:10.680 --> 41:15.600
The Simpsons arcade game has been classified in Australia.

41:15.600 --> 41:21.060
What that means is that the rating has actually shown up on the Australian classification

41:21.060 --> 41:22.600
board's website.

41:22.600 --> 41:27.400
So it seems to indicate that the Simpsons arcade game could be on its way to Xbox live

41:27.400 --> 41:33.760
arcade and PlayStation network because backbone is the one that is, I guess, registered the

41:33.760 --> 41:35.880
game backbone entertainment.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.720
They do a lot of the like classic games stuff.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.880
One of the more recent ones they did was the X-Men arcade port, and it is saying it's published

41:42.880 --> 41:44.080
by Konami.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.680
So I don't know how that all works because I thought EA had the license, but maybe some

41:47.680 --> 41:51.440
agreement was reached after all, when the Ninja turtles arcade game came out, they did

41:51.440 --> 41:53.440
have a mutual agreement there.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.220
So maybe something's been worked out.

41:55.220 --> 42:00.360
So we may be getting the Simpsons arcade game on Xbox live arcade very soon, which fuck yes

42:00.360 --> 42:01.360
to that.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.200
That was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day.

42:03.200 --> 42:07.440
I want to say we did a listless sometime ago about like Xbox live arcade game they most

42:07.440 --> 42:09.720
need and that was on it.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.560
So heck yeah, that'd be awesome.

42:11.560 --> 42:15.880
I hope they didn't screw it up, but if it's like the X-Men arcade port, I think it'll

42:15.880 --> 42:16.880
be fine.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.800
And some of the other stuff they've done has been all right.

42:19.800 --> 42:23.680
So, all right, Dark Sakura.

42:23.680 --> 42:26.080
Actually I was checking the mailbox again to make sure we actually had something this

42:26.080 --> 42:27.360
time.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.360
We do.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.360
Hooray.

42:29.360 --> 42:34.000
So it's been going around, people have been talking about it, about the security breach

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
with Valve.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.640
Valve actually did acknowledge that user's personal information had been compromised.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.780
There was a security breach.

42:43.780 --> 42:49.840
They said that they accessed a Steam database in addition to the forums.

42:49.840 --> 42:55.700
That user names, passwords, game purchases, email address, billing addresses, credit card

42:55.700 --> 42:58.300
information.

42:58.300 --> 43:02.760
They don't have evidence that credit card information or personal identification was

43:02.760 --> 43:07.280
taken or that the protection on them was cracked.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.400
They're still trying to get into that.

43:09.400 --> 43:15.040
But they said, watch your stuff very closely, which is why the only thing that's remotely

43:15.040 --> 43:20.000
linked on my Steam account is that I use PayPal.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
That's it.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
Well, lucky you, but yeah, my credit card of course was on Steam.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Go figure.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.760
Actually, I don't think the new one is because mine lapsed during the year and I'm not sure

43:31.760 --> 43:32.760
I ever put the new one on.

43:32.760 --> 43:35.680
I don't really buy a lot of stuff on Steam and when I do, I just get it through PayPal.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.600
I buy tons on Steam.

43:37.600 --> 43:44.500
But yeah, I don't know, like you think I'd be more pissed off about this because of what

43:44.500 --> 43:51.560
happened with Sony, but I don't know, there's a certain trust you kind of have with Valve

43:51.560 --> 43:55.520
because they get so much other stuff and I kind of feel like they're being a little more

43:55.520 --> 43:59.480
upfront with this than maybe necessarily Sony was.

43:59.480 --> 44:03.200
And I do feel like a lot of the data was probably encrypted pretty well.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.680
So I don't know.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.760
Well here's a statement from Newell.

44:07.760 --> 44:12.560
We do not know of any compromised Steam accounts, so we are not planning to force a change of

44:12.560 --> 44:16.280
Steam account passwords, which are separate from the forum passwords.

44:16.280 --> 44:20.240
However, it wouldn't be a bad idea to change that as well, especially if it's the same

44:20.240 --> 44:23.480
as your Steam forum account password.

44:23.480 --> 44:26.800
So I think mine are different.

44:26.800 --> 44:33.560
I think also at the end of the day, the fault of this is not Valve's fault.

44:33.560 --> 44:35.300
It's the hacker's fault.

44:35.300 --> 44:40.140
You know, I don't know what Valve did to necessarily provoke this besides maybe Gabe Newell getting

44:40.140 --> 44:44.520
up there at GDC and saying, you know, that it was unhackable and kind of daring people

44:44.520 --> 44:45.760
to do it at some point.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.800
I don't think that he would do that.

44:47.800 --> 44:50.720
But it was, and it wasn't quite the way I'm saying it either.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.120
He was just kind of showing about the security protection and all that, the Steam guard and

44:54.120 --> 44:55.480
all that.

44:55.480 --> 45:00.360
But at the end of the day, these guys weren't in there to steal games and maybe they didn't

45:00.360 --> 45:02.100
steal the credit card information.

45:02.100 --> 45:05.840
You know, I think Valve is just being very upfront that, hey, that information was at

45:05.840 --> 45:06.840
risk.

45:06.840 --> 45:12.520
And I don't know, the PlayStation network kind of felt like a Benny Hill show from the

45:12.520 --> 45:13.520
beginning.

45:13.520 --> 45:18.200
You know, just, it was one person tripping over another from there.

45:18.200 --> 45:22.940
But I mean, obviously I'm not like, I'm a little bit upset and I'd like to kind of see

45:22.940 --> 45:27.580
what Valve is going to do to make sure that my information doesn't stay at risk.

45:27.580 --> 45:31.440
You know, I want to hear more constant updates about what they do, find out about what was

45:31.440 --> 45:32.680
taken and not.

45:32.680 --> 45:36.240
And if they do suspect that credit card information was taken, then they need to offer a lot of

45:36.240 --> 45:41.480
the same services, like the debits and all that, that, that a PlayStation was offering.

45:41.480 --> 45:42.480
But I don't know.

45:42.480 --> 45:47.720
I kind of trust them to do a better job with their PR than I do Sony.

45:47.720 --> 45:51.400
At the end of the day, no one ever had money taken from them on Sony either.

45:51.400 --> 45:58.520
So, and hopefully nobody has money taken from them on Valve either, uh, chat.orangelauntrader.com.

45:58.520 --> 46:02.240
Some of the comments, uh, salacious pop says the credit card info they got as hashed and

46:02.240 --> 46:03.640
encrypted as shit.

46:03.640 --> 46:06.120
So they'd have to crack that to do anything.

46:06.120 --> 46:10.200
Also steam only lets you store one card on and it's very easy to delete it.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.760
Uh, act theft says steam only saves the last card you used.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.560
Um, game guru says valve is how you are supposed to address being hacked.

46:17.560 --> 46:21.720
Uh, dark Tetsuya says I did change my password, even though I didn't really have any credit

46:21.720 --> 46:24.880
card info on it, just at a habit for this sort of thing.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.640
And that's a really good habit to have.

46:26.640 --> 46:30.280
And if you haven't changed your steam password, you probably just should.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.960
What what's, what's to lose from doing it.

46:32.960 --> 46:36.420
Nobody's ever given me a good reason why you shouldn't change your password besides I can't

46:36.420 --> 46:38.160
keep track of all those different passwords.

46:38.160 --> 46:41.320
Well that's, you're, you're going to have to come up with a better excuse than that

46:41.320 --> 46:42.440
in this day and age.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.440
You know what I mean?

46:43.440 --> 46:46.380
Um, Kaijuto has a very good point though.

46:46.380 --> 46:49.760
Just because valve is run by nerds doesn't mean they're hack proof.

46:49.760 --> 46:50.880
Nothing is.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.680
And game guru also puts this pretty clear here.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.160
People's been clear and up front, Sony tried to hide everything.

46:57.160 --> 46:58.160
That's true too.

46:58.160 --> 47:01.880
I do seem to remember that Sony, you know, the network was still up for a few days after

47:01.880 --> 47:04.880
and then it was just, it was, it was bad.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.680
Chat dot orange dot orange radio dot com is the place where those comments are coming

47:07.680 --> 47:08.680
from right now.

47:08.680 --> 47:11.280
Cause we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

47:11.280 --> 47:17.420
Uh, Khasan in our chat room, K-H-A-S-N says I need to check my credit card transactions.

47:17.420 --> 47:20.480
That's all, that's just a good thing to do anyway.

47:20.480 --> 47:25.960
Like yeah, this should motivate you to do that, but just, I think check them at least

47:25.960 --> 47:28.720
once a week, if not like three times a week.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.480
I check my bank account every day.

47:30.480 --> 47:34.680
Just a, I like to know how much money's in there cause who actually balances a checkbook

47:34.680 --> 47:35.680
anymore?

47:35.680 --> 47:40.560
And b, I just like to see that all the transactions that are going through are things that I actually

47:40.560 --> 47:41.560
initiated.

47:41.560 --> 47:47.040
Well, um, I, before the show I checked my, uh, PayPal just to be sure.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.520
And of course there's nothing cause I'm broke.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.520
That's good.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.520
That's what you want to see.

47:51.520 --> 47:56.360
But yeah, I mean the last thing on there was last month when I bought the, uh, the Humble

47:56.360 --> 47:57.360
Indie bundle.

47:57.360 --> 47:58.360
Ah.

47:58.360 --> 47:59.360
That was it.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.360
Nice.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.360
All right.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.360
All right.

48:02.360 --> 48:05.560
Well hopefully we'll get more information on that in the weeks to come as to who did

48:05.560 --> 48:06.560
it.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.680
Hang them up by their balls.

48:07.680 --> 48:08.680
Who done it?

48:08.680 --> 48:09.680
Who done it?

48:09.680 --> 48:12.320
It was Ms. Scarlet in the conservatory.

48:12.320 --> 48:16.620
Um, and of course, you know, steam isn't the only thing to get hacked this week.

48:16.620 --> 48:22.280
Also the My Resistance website, the official website for the game Resistance, um, from

48:22.280 --> 48:27.560
Sony got, uh, hacked as well and their forums are down as well.

48:27.560 --> 48:34.240
Um, and basically, you know, the, there's no, uh, it hasn't been immediately verified

48:34.240 --> 48:39.520
by Insomniac or Sony, um, whether anything was done.

48:39.520 --> 48:44.000
I don't think anything's really compromised other than these people's usernames and passwords

48:44.000 --> 48:49.640
and maybe emails because, you know, you don't store credit card information on this website.

48:49.640 --> 48:55.120
So, um, basically, uh, yeah, it sucks.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.120
Hackers are gonna hack.

48:56.120 --> 48:57.800
Yeah, I guess that's true.

48:57.800 --> 49:00.200
We have said that before.

49:00.200 --> 49:03.400
What did, what do they get from this besides, cause there's no like, it's not like they

49:03.400 --> 49:06.480
have credit cards on the Resistance site or anything like that, right?

49:06.480 --> 49:12.840
Um, I think what they could be doing is they could be harvesting usernames and passwords,

49:12.840 --> 49:17.240
maybe emails and stuff to try to run those against, you know, logins on the PlayStation

49:17.240 --> 49:18.240
network.

49:18.240 --> 49:23.880
You know, to see if any of those people have the same username, password, login info that

49:23.880 --> 49:26.080
they would on both of those.

49:26.080 --> 49:32.640
Um, I don't know if maybe there's a way to link your account to, um, that site or something.

49:32.640 --> 49:36.560
I don't think you'd have to put your password in though for that, but my, my guess is just,

49:36.560 --> 49:41.160
it's mainly just to find username password combos that they can try at a bunch of different

49:41.160 --> 49:46.520
websites and see if people are using the same things and maybe get access to accounts that

49:46.520 --> 49:47.520
way.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.000
All right.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.560
Well, more hacking stories on the Xbox.

49:52.560 --> 49:56.840
Hackings are still kind of slowly bubbling through the press and so forth.

49:56.840 --> 49:58.860
And I've addressed this on a show before.

49:58.860 --> 50:02.640
If you forgot, I had 150 bucks stolen from my Xbox back in August.

50:02.640 --> 50:06.560
It was about August 14th, 15th or so that that was happened.

50:06.560 --> 50:11.280
And I basically lost access to my Xbox for a month while they were investigating and

50:11.280 --> 50:12.280
finally got my money back.

50:12.280 --> 50:15.840
I think it was about 28 days after the incident had happened.

50:15.840 --> 50:20.040
Uh, so I was out 150 bucks for 28 days and that's not something I know everybody can

50:20.040 --> 50:21.040
afford to do.

50:21.040 --> 50:22.680
Um, so you gotta be very careful.

50:22.680 --> 50:28.120
Um, Microsoft refuses that anything is going on, but I know at least 10 individuals that

50:28.120 --> 50:29.120
this has happened to.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.400
I am not making that number up.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.880
Granted, I have a lot of Facebook friends and people on Twitter, but I know at least

50:33.880 --> 50:34.880
10.

50:34.880 --> 50:37.760
And then I still have people telling me like friends of friends and so forth.

50:37.760 --> 50:41.260
So I know that doesn't seem like a very large number, but considering I know people all

50:41.260 --> 50:47.440
through the spectrum from people who play games all the time, every day to people that

50:47.440 --> 50:51.040
hadn't touched their account in one to two years.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.440
That tells me that something's going on.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.980
And this shit made me angry this week is I saw that there was a report on Eurogamer.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.100
I'm not mad at Eurogamer.

50:58.100 --> 50:59.100
They're just reporting it.

50:59.100 --> 51:00.100
Don't shoot the messenger.

51:00.100 --> 51:01.100
Right.

51:01.100 --> 51:05.520
And apparently Microsoft is claiming that all these FIFA ultimate team pack purchases

51:05.520 --> 51:08.520
that are the, uh, quote hacks going on.

51:08.520 --> 51:12.300
Microsoft is claiming in an interview with Eurogamer from online safety director Doug

51:12.300 --> 51:13.300
Park.

51:13.300 --> 51:17.620
It is not a hack that it is some type of quote new attack vector quote.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.720
It's not a hack.

51:18.720 --> 51:23.120
It's really just a different way to monetize stolen accounts.

51:23.120 --> 51:26.240
What any service has compromises.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.760
Facebook has compromises.

51:27.760 --> 51:29.280
Wow has compromises.

51:29.280 --> 51:32.420
What they're really doing is trying to make money off those compromises.

51:32.420 --> 51:34.520
So FIFA is a very popular title.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.840
It's just a new way for the bad guys to make money.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.700
It wasn't based on our investigation.

51:38.700 --> 51:39.800
We didn't see anything new.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.760
It was just a different Avenue.

51:41.760 --> 51:45.720
I'm not getting into super detail, but there is basics of account compromise.

51:45.720 --> 51:50.480
There's phishing, there's social engineering, there's malware based off the industry today.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.000
Most of it comes off malware and phishing.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.040
If they get the accounts, they sell it.

51:54.040 --> 51:57.120
That's really all they were doing, whether it's FIFA or an account with a PlayStation

51:57.120 --> 51:59.700
subscription or an account with a live subscription.

51:59.700 --> 52:02.840
It's all basically the same thing.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.420
So basically he's deflecting.

52:05.420 --> 52:10.980
He's refusing to accept that anything's going wrong at Xbox and you, sir, are lying.

52:10.980 --> 52:14.920
You may not know you're lying, but I'm here to tell you that these claims that this is

52:14.920 --> 52:19.320
all like phishing and all this stuff, you're full of crap.

52:19.320 --> 52:23.720
Wake up because something deeper is going on here and it has to do with Xbox and it

52:23.720 --> 52:28.260
has to do with EA because I will poke a hole in this right now.

52:28.260 --> 52:33.120
The people that are getting hacked, it's not just FIFA, dun dun dun.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.040
It's other EA games.

52:35.040 --> 52:38.740
I know somebody that got money stolen out of Madden.

52:38.740 --> 52:42.600
I know somebody where the first person that they are, the first game that they went into

52:42.600 --> 52:48.720
to go play on it was, um, it was also actually was also Madden in that case, but it's other

52:48.720 --> 52:50.360
EA sports games.

52:50.360 --> 52:51.640
Look for a class action.

52:51.640 --> 52:56.520
It's not just FIFA, although that seems to be the most popular one because that's where

52:56.520 --> 53:00.200
they can take the big chunk of money and I guess probably monetize something, but it's

53:00.200 --> 53:01.400
happening through other games.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.140
But guess what?

53:03.140 --> 53:06.360
They're all EA games.

53:06.360 --> 53:13.040
Can anyone show me, can anyone show me a game that is that are an Xbox hack that's going

53:13.040 --> 53:16.400
on that did not somehow involve an EA product?

53:16.400 --> 53:18.400
Can anyone show that?

53:18.400 --> 53:23.960
That orange knowledge radio.com twitter.com slash O L R is anyone that's been impacted

53:23.960 --> 53:28.800
where there more money has been taken out of the account was an EA game not involved

53:28.800 --> 53:35.520
because I'll tell you what I think I know the link and the link is I believe that the

53:35.520 --> 53:42.680
people that are getting hacked are people that do not play EA sports games.

53:42.680 --> 53:48.880
I've never played an EA sports game on Xbox live save for, um, uh, the burnout paradise,

53:48.880 --> 53:50.520
which did not have the EA network.

53:50.520 --> 53:54.840
Um, some of the other, you know, like rock band, which isn't a part of that new EA network

53:54.840 --> 53:59.240
and all that other people that I know that have been hacked do not play EA sports games

53:59.240 --> 54:04.640
online or they have not played their Xbox in several years.

54:04.640 --> 54:13.560
If you do not have your Xbox account tied to the new EA system, you are vulnerable.

54:13.560 --> 54:17.680
I believe that I don't have any proof, but trending that I see.

54:17.680 --> 54:21.840
So I'm just some shmo on a podcast, putting that out there, whatever, take it or leave

54:21.840 --> 54:22.840
it.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.680
But I'm telling you, I think if you want to best protect yourself, one thing that you

54:26.680 --> 54:30.880
should do right now, well, in addition to change your password, which I've told you

54:30.880 --> 54:34.340
5,000 times to do, and if you haven't done it by now, I don't know what to tell you,

54:34.340 --> 54:40.720
but I think what you should do go download the demo for either NBA jam on fire or need

54:40.720 --> 54:44.480
for speed, the run, which granted wasn't a bad demo.

54:44.480 --> 54:47.760
When you play those demos, you're going to have to create an EA account to get onto those

54:47.760 --> 54:48.960
servers.

54:48.960 --> 54:53.000
And now you'll establish a link between your Xbox and your EA account, because I'm telling

54:53.000 --> 55:00.740
you, when I got hacked, they linked a fake account up and somehow there's some vulnerability

55:00.740 --> 55:04.320
there that neither Microsoft nor EA will admit.

55:04.320 --> 55:08.560
But I'm telling you, there's too much of a trend here for me to ignore.

55:08.560 --> 55:12.400
As a gamer, as somebody who doesn't want the fans of this show to lose money, I'm just

55:12.400 --> 55:16.360
telling you, what I'm seeing in all these other cases are people that have not linked

55:16.360 --> 55:19.800
the EA account through some type of sports title are the ones that are being hacked.

55:19.800 --> 55:23.200
I don't know how they're doing it, but that's the common denominator, dammit.

55:23.200 --> 55:28.100
At the very least, going ahead and associating it with an account would prevent the whatever

55:28.100 --> 55:30.680
exploit there might be from being used.

55:30.680 --> 55:33.560
I don't think it's necessarily that they're not getting hacked, it's just that they're

55:33.560 --> 55:38.000
not buying anything with it, because once they find out, oh, well, I can't get access

55:38.000 --> 55:42.700
to the EA thing, then, well, not much I can do there.

55:42.700 --> 55:47.000
And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that this bozo would go out there and say that

55:47.000 --> 55:48.960
we're all being phished.

55:48.960 --> 55:49.960
Because he's wrong.

55:49.960 --> 55:54.800
I know somebody that hadn't touched their Xbox in two years.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.520
Like I'm supposed to believe that guy somehow got phished?

55:57.520 --> 56:01.960
Oh, I haven't played my Xbox in two years, but shit, I'm gonna log onto this website

56:01.960 --> 56:05.160
and just give them my Xbox login.

56:05.160 --> 56:07.200
Really?

56:07.200 --> 56:09.960
I'd like to think I'm somewhat smarter than that, too.

56:09.960 --> 56:15.760
I mean, I'd like to think, I mean, I'm not gonna be all Sony, big in the head about it,

56:15.760 --> 56:21.120
that I am penetratable when it comes to getting, you know, my information phished or whatever,

56:21.120 --> 56:25.640
but I'd like to think, I always think twice about links I click on and websites I'm visiting

56:25.640 --> 56:28.260
and make sure the websites are genuine.

56:28.260 --> 56:31.720
So if this guy's gonna come out and say that I'm getting phished, you better be ready to

56:31.720 --> 56:34.560
throw down, because you might be wrong.

56:34.560 --> 56:42.400
And if you're wrong, I'm gonna be double mad.

56:42.400 --> 56:46.360
Fifth dream in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrader.com says you'd be amazed how many people don't

56:46.360 --> 56:52.140
know the password that their email address associated with their Xbox Live accounts.

56:52.140 --> 56:53.140
Get it reset.

56:53.140 --> 56:54.280
You gotta do something.

56:54.280 --> 56:58.000
Take control of that, especially if you have a credit card tied to it.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.200
They're getting in there somehow.

56:59.200 --> 57:00.920
I don't know what they're doing.

57:00.920 --> 57:01.980
I don't know how they're doing it.

57:01.980 --> 57:06.880
If we knew, it would be all over the gaming media, but nobody can figure out how they're

57:06.880 --> 57:07.880
doing it.

57:07.880 --> 57:13.560
And Microsoft won't admit that there's a problem, because somehow they're both being used.

57:13.560 --> 57:14.860
Microsoft and EA.

57:14.860 --> 57:19.040
And I don't, I can't figure out how.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.680
Somebody's gonna figure it out, though.

57:20.680 --> 57:27.560
Honestly, I think they should start looking into their password reset system.

57:27.560 --> 57:30.840
I wanna say one more thing about this, because this is the other thing.

57:30.840 --> 57:34.880
This guy is deflecting, because he tries to throw all these other companies under the

57:34.880 --> 57:35.880
bus.

57:35.880 --> 57:38.040
And he says, any service has compromises.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.960
WOW has compromises.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.360
Okay, true point.

57:41.360 --> 57:43.120
I've also had my WOW account hacked.

57:43.120 --> 57:45.960
I think I know how that happened, and I do think that was phishing.

57:45.960 --> 57:49.560
I think I used, I logged into a computer that I shouldn't have logged into WOW in.

57:49.560 --> 57:50.760
So, okay, fair enough.

57:50.760 --> 57:55.160
Again, I said earlier, I'm not perfect, it can't happen, okay?

57:55.160 --> 58:01.160
But there's a big difference between what WOW is doing and what Microsoft's doing.

58:01.160 --> 58:05.360
Blizzard will openly admit that your accounts are vulnerable to theft, that people will

58:05.360 --> 58:08.000
try and steal your Xbox accounts.

58:08.000 --> 58:13.280
Blizzard will sell an authenticator, so that you can get into your accounts, and try to

58:13.280 --> 58:17.760
bring incentives for you to use those authenticators, like free pets and so forth.

58:17.760 --> 58:21.480
They've come up with new ways of authentication, like authenticating by phone.

58:21.480 --> 58:24.440
They are constantly trying to change the security in their system.

58:24.440 --> 58:25.840
What are you doing, Microsoft?

58:25.840 --> 58:30.140
Oh, we're watching the situation very closely.

58:30.140 --> 58:33.360
On top of that, they give away the authenticator for free, and the only thing that you have

58:33.360 --> 58:35.360
to pay for is if you buy a physical authenticator.

58:35.360 --> 58:37.200
That's true, they have the mobile phone authenticator for free.

58:37.200 --> 58:38.200
Which is what I use.

58:38.200 --> 58:40.840
That's very true, good point.

58:40.840 --> 58:42.760
Microsoft doesn't have anything like that.

58:42.760 --> 58:46.160
Microsoft doesn't tell people to change their passwords regularly.

58:46.160 --> 58:49.440
Microsoft won't admit that there's people out there trying to steal money from your

58:49.440 --> 58:50.440
account.

58:50.440 --> 58:54.680
At least if they're doing it, I'm sure they would come back and say, well, Robin is right

58:54.680 --> 58:55.680
here on the website.

58:55.680 --> 58:59.680
Okay, on some page, people never look at it, and the font size is not big enough, anyone

58:59.680 --> 59:00.680
can see it.

59:00.680 --> 59:05.820
It is right there on the login screen, as you're waiting for the game to load, on wow.

59:05.820 --> 59:07.340
Protect your account from theft.

59:07.340 --> 59:12.500
Do A, B, and C. That's the level of stuff that Microsoft needs to do, because accounts

59:12.500 --> 59:18.560
are being stolen, and it's not just because we're all stupid when it comes to learning

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
the internet.

59:19.560 --> 59:23.440
Anyhow, I've ranted enough, sorry.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.560
But it just irritates me.

59:25.560 --> 59:33.240
This is such corporate, you know, just talking out his butt, and it irritates me the more

59:33.240 --> 59:36.240
Microsoft tries to deny that anything is wrong.

59:36.240 --> 59:40.720
You know what another term for talking out of your butt is?

59:40.720 --> 59:41.720
Farting?

59:41.720 --> 59:42.720
Furthermore.

59:42.720 --> 59:43.720
Or shit.

59:43.720 --> 59:44.720
I said I was dumb, but I'm not.

59:44.720 --> 59:48.480
Furthermore, maybe it would irritate, I know, I'm a total liar.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.760
Dan's in the other room, one liar.

59:49.760 --> 59:53.420
It would irritate me a lot less if that, you know, the other part of this is that I was

59:53.420 --> 59:58.780
locked out of my Xbox account for 28 days.

59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.480
How long was I out of my wow account when I got hacked?

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.480
A day?

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480
An hour.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Okay.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.980
Fix it, Microsoft.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.800
And have better font.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800
Moving on.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800
Okay.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.720
Well, one good thing that they're doing, though, is that Xbox.com lets you cancel your auto

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.320
renewal for Xbox Live.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.680
There is a toggle that you can turn on or off, and instead of them automatically renewing,

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.400
if you turn it off, then they won't renew, clearly.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:39.960
There's actually, there's also the beacons functionality added in, so that you can say

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.120
which games you would like to play with other people, and that's actually on Xbox Live now.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:52.400
New messaging, new browsing, new searching for films and TV, that type of thing.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.200
And they have a new interface that goes with the Metro UI theme.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:05.840
So I guess that's cool, but honestly, it's not enough, but it's something.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.680
Well, it's better than what was there before, which was still having to call support and

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680
all that stuff.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.600
But by the way, just to throw it out there, certain other subscription things, you cannot

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.300
cancel online as easily still.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.720
So although it may make it sound like there's certain things...

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.960
And by the way, I tried to go in.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.040
The first thing I tried to do, not only did Microsoft...

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040
Oh, God.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.640
I was so mad at them lately.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.440
Not only did Microsoft automatically update my credit card info.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440
Like I don't know what they did.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.380
Did they guess the new expiration date?

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:40.480
I don't know how they did it, but they automatically updated my credit card information.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.640
I can't remove it.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.620
You can't remove your credit card on the website.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:51.160
You try to click remove and it goes, you cannot remove this card because you are currently

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:57.080
using this card to pay for your one month card of Xbox Live.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:05.680
I can't remove my credit card because I'm using it to fund a prepaid Xbox Live card?

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.360
No, that's when you report it to the Better Business Bureau.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.360
Ridiculous.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.400
But Rob, you're paying for the free card.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400
Enough smoke and mirrors.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400
What?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.400
I said, but you're paying for the free card.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.520
That's hilarious.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.280
I mean, not in a funny way, but just I was like, seriously, you guys are going to go

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280
that far?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.960
So much smoke and mirrors from Microsoft to the point where like I am I am seriously considering

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.160
the next console.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.660
Somebody called me out on Twitter, too, about it, which is fine.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.660
That's fine.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.660
You know, I have an opinion.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.760
If you think there's there's a problem with it, then whatever.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.240
But somebody had said, wait, you are mad at Microsoft when PlayStation was the one that

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.160
opened it got hacked and all that.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.160
Fair point.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.000
But still, has anyone presented a case where somebody actually had money stole them stolen

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.880
from them from PlayStation?

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.880
Has anyone been able to prove that?

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.080
Because I could prove to you about 10 different cases of money being stolen, many, many more.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.660
If you look at the Web forums that are out there on Xbox.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.960
Why are we all mad at Sony again?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:24.160
Because of the potential loss, the potential, Rob, we're going to be mad at Sony, be mad

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.280
at Sony about, you know, them bumble fucking tripping over their own feet and handling

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.600
the situation.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.120
I'm just saying Microsoft's really no better.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.560
Well, this is their M.O.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.960
I mean, look at what they do with the red ring systems and stuff like that.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.080
Oh, it was a small percentage.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:47.200
I was like one percent and definitely not 100 percent or 50 or whatever.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.280
So just flip it.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.280
That's all I'm saying.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.320
The folks that are saying that flip it.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320
Why?

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:58.200
Why do you get why do you give Microsoft to pass all the time?

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.360
Let's be equally critical of all the game companies.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360
We should.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360
Nintendo, why aren't you?

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.200
Well, we should give them hundreds of dollars, which we do.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.520
I have a right to be critical of a company I'm giving hundreds of dollars to.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.920
That holds my credit card hostage.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.120
But anyway, let's move on release dates.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.120
Yes.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120
I love video games.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.120
I do.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.400
But just some of this some of this stuff I could do without continuing on with the plethora

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:33.600

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.600

It's like that one game that they have on the PlayStation Network.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:50.440
It's like a side scroller Kung Fu game that uses the Kinect camera.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.160
L.A. Noire The Complete Edition on PC this week.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.000

get U-Draw Instant Artist if you already have the U-Draw tablet on the Wii as a standalone

title.

Rapala for Kinect on Xbox 360 this week, so you can punch fish in the face, that's literally

what you do in this game.

That's not bad at all.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.440
Well, it's Xbox 360 and you only get the guitar with, I thought it had the game in there.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440
It's not the game.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440
I get it.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.880
It's just DLC.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:48.720
out as well as some type of Modern Warfare 3 themed Xbox Live card, because as far as

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.100
I'm concerned, you should be doing all of your Microsoft transactions right now with

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.200
cards only.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:01.840
There is also a game coming out called Naorihon no Mago Hyaki Rairaran Taisen that comes out

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.720
this week from Konami.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.640
This looks like...I'm trying to figure out what game this is.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.920
I don't know if it's based on an anime.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.420
It is a fighting game that's coming out.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.980
From the strongest team to defeat the Harugomo Kitsune, that powerful fox spirit has been

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:24.200
devouring people and usurping power since the Heian era, and Riko, the leader of Hakai

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.600
Yayo, the March of 100 Ogres, is the one to defeat her.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:34.100
So it's a fighting game on the 360 that I am not familiar with on this side of the pond.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:40.200
Going to the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty in subtitles there as well, Ninokuni Shiroki

Seihai no Juu comes out from level 5 this week.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.800
This is a...oh, it's the Studio Ghibli game on PlayStation 3.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.200
That looks like it could be very impressive, actually.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.720
That looks...ooh, it's all cartoony.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720
That game's very cute.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.720
Let me look.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.720
Wait, wait.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720
Go back.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
Look at that.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.600
This is the Studio Ghibli on PlayStation 3.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.960
That's cute.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.960
Yeah.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.080
That looks like it would be worth importing.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.840
It is Ninokunai.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.680
It's a magical land on PlayStation 3.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.360
The orphan Oliver is determined to save his mother, who died to save him.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.640
In order to do so, he followed Shizuku, the fairy of the tears, into the world of Ninokuni

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.320
to defeat the evil magician Jabo.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.320
Huh.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.320
Ninokuni.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320
Huh.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.120
Good times.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.520
That fighting game I spoke of earlier is out on the PlayStation 3 as well, and there is

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.000
a whole PlayStation 3 bundle, because they love the different bundles there in Japan.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.040
There's a whole bundle around that Ghibli game, so that's gonna be fun.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.760
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 there as well, as well as The Sims 3 Pets and Saints Row the Third,

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.920

Trying to see if that's a game I recognize.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:08.640
It's chapters 3 and 4 of an ongoing series.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.520
That is out on the PSP this week.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.720
Lastly, cleaning up on the Wii and the 3DS, nothing on the Wii this week, because, you

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.680
know, Wii releases are kind of dying.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:25.600
Same is true in Japan, but on the 3DS this week, Shinobi 3D and The Sims 3 Pets.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.200

Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Apache Air Assault for PC.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.080
Sit.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.300
Busy, busy.

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.560
In our chatroom, by the way, they are talking about Ni No Kuni, which I had mentioned before,

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.560
the Studio Ghibli game.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.600
They are saying, some folks, AlphaKananagram says, they did say that it's coming to North

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600
America, I think.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.640
And Dark Tetsuya says, I thought it was coming out over here.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.200
Yeah, it probably is, but not this week.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.500
Japan's getting it first.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:22.000
If we're getting it, what, summer next year, maybe?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Spring.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Spring.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Oh, you looked it up, huh?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
No.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I just know.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Oh.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Well.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So we are getting it.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It's just, you know, gonna take a little time for the translation.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Yeah.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.680
We're gonna do a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680
the week.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.680
But first.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:43.680
Well, everyone's been wondering with the Vita, is there gonna be a way for me to import my

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.920
games that I may have on UMD to the Vita?

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.960
And the answer is yes.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.720
There is actually a way to do that.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:56.320
And it's not free, but it's a discount.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.200
So I guess that's better than nothing.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.680
Basically, what you do is you take your existing PSP.

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.240
You pop in the UMD that you want to register.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.880
And it will register on the website, I guess, or on their service.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.280
And you'll be able to download the game at a small fee.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:18.120
And of course, they haven't announced prices over here yet, since the Vita's still a ways

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.120
away.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.000
But in Japan, it ranges between an average of 500 and 1000 yen.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.320
So it's not bad.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.280
That's a pretty good compromise, I think.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.720
And you know, really, if you want to abuse that, you could take a friend's UMD or rent

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.920
a UMD or something like that, pop it in their register like you own it.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.360
I mean, there's no way for them to know, but at least you get a little bit of a discount

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.880
if you're planning on actually buying the game anyways.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.240
I still don't like the fact that I'm having to basically put in the UMD to have the privilege

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.760
of paying for the game all over again.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.680
Well, I get it.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680
It just sucks.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.600
I mean, the only reason they're doing that is because they know people are gonna abuse

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600
it.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.240
And because they can.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:07.000
And because really, just play it on your PSP then if you don't want to, you know, if you

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.360
don't want to pay for it.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360
I guess that's true.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.960
Still, wouldn't it be nice if they just had true backwards compatibility, but I guess

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.000
you can't do that when you change formats.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.240
Anyhow, um, so it's gonna be backwards compatible, just obviously you can't, you know, well,

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.240
it's not really though.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.000
Well, there's no UMD drive, big deal.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.520
That's an antiquated format.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.880
Alright, moving on.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.160
What about the digital copies of games I bought?

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.200
I bought 30 Second Hero digitally.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.280
Will I be able to just download that to my Vita?

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280
Yes.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280
Okay, then I'm fine.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280
Then that's good.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.080
Yeah, all that stuff is tied to your network account and you can re-download it to that,

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.440
but it's just UMD games, you know, there's no way to transfer that because they're not

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.440
gonna make a UMD drive.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.120
I feel a little better then.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:59.840
Alright, moving on to information about Super Mario 3D Land, which was of course a big,

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:04.120
release today, came out today, a lot of people very excited about that, um, I wanna pick

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.920
this up at some point, amongst all the other games.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.480
Here's the thing, it is one of the games I wanna get for the 3DS, but I just don't see

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.320
myself playing it anytime soon, and I'm in no big hurry, it's a Mario game, you know,

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.880
I know it's gonna be good, but it's not like, I gotta rush out and go get it.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.880
I have been hearing a lot of good things about it, it's getting really good reviews, but

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.040
it's getting lost amongst all the Modern Warfare and Skyrim chatter, but this is one for the

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.000
younger crowd too, I mean, all ages really.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.560
It reminds me a lot of Mario Galaxy, but just in, you know, the 3DS.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560
And that's not a bad thing?

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560
No, it's not a bad thing.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560
Mario Galaxy's fucking great.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.160
But anyway, um, there is a help system in the game, a lot of the newer Nintendo games

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.960
have kinda held your hand a little bit if you constantly fuck up, and Mario 3D Land

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.960
is no different.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.540
Uh, it's been revealed through, you know, people playing the game today, that if you

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:53.340
die twice, you'll get a free power-up at the beginning of the level, like a random power-up

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340
that happens.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:18:00.200
And if you die five times in a level, you get a tanooki suit that's basically invincibility

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.480
the whole way through the level.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.280
So it's like, you can't die unless you are just a baddie.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.380
Um, so it really will help you handle, I mean, can you imagine if the original Mario Brothers

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.380
had did that?

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.020
Like, oh, you're having problems beating World 8 too?

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.600
You can't get through these hammer brothers?

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.200
Here, have invincibility through the entire level.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.240
That's just why I saved P-Wings and flew over the whole damn thing.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.720
So that's, uh, you know, that's where we're at now.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.960
Now, here's the interesting thing though, is that you're only allowed to do that the

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.080
first time you beat a level.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.860
If you're trying to go back and look for coins, be a completionist and so forth, you don't

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.080
get help.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.480
So if you're gonna go collect coins and shit, you better do it the first time you have that

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.460
tanooki suit, cause you won't be getting it again.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.280
So that's the help in Mario 3D.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.140
Anyhow, uh, what's all this, what's all this newfangled 3D stuff?

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.420
You remember a time when gaming was simpler?

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:57.220
We didn't have all this newfangled 3D Mario Galaxy.

01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:02.240
No, we had Super Mario Brothers 2D.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.240
We liked it.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.480
We're gonna travel back to a simpler time where Dark Sakura's gonna get into the classic

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.620
gaming vault and find a game that she says, hey, hey, I don't wanna hear about your Skyrim.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:15.460
I wanna hear about your Modern Warfare, your 3DSes.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.060
I don't know about your Skyrim job.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:21.200
Go play this game because this is classic gaming.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.020
I think that you should play the intro to the game.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.500
A lot of people are just gonna pick it up right now.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.500
They're gonna get it right away.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:31.400
All right, well then let's go right to the intro of this week's classic game of the week.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:42.240
This is an oldie goodie.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.820
Or maybe you were like five when this game came out.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.140
Well, I said rock on purpose.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.540
There have been a lot of hard listeners who were.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:58.660
It's Mega Man X, also known as Rockman X, which came out on Super Nintendo or also the

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:05.580
Super Famicom in 1993 in Japan, 1994 in North America.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.180
There's PC versions, yay.

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:12.860
But this is probably one of the best of the series.

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:19.220
So it's like in the future Mega Man X was made by Dr. Light and stored away in a capsule

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:22.060
for 30 years and Dr. Light probably died.

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:29.260
So this other one named Dr. Cane finds him and, well, he made a bunch of robots based

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.820
on X and they all went crazy.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:33.220
So basically X has to go stop him.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.340
We have zero in this game, it's awesome.

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:44.100
So this is what really, I think, where the Mega Man games were really cool, you know,

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.780
and I've always thought they were really awesome.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:53.500
I think though that having the X series really kind of launched it into the next level, if

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:58.500
you'll pardon me for using the phrase.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.500
Anyway, as it went through there, we had more characters.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:10.340
Like I said, there was Zero who was brought in, there was Axl, Sigma, you know, as the

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.180
bad guy.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:16.700
And then, so moving through, there were also, of course, later games.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:24.700
There was all the way up through Rockman, Mega Man X8, I think was the last part.

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:30.700
Dan's gonna be the last one.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:37.260
That's what I meant, yeah, X8 was the last one.

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:42.940
I had to be sure, well, I was pretty sure, but you know, we've also had different versions

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:43.940
of them.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:50.680
There's been Mega Man Xtreme and Xtreme 2, which was in Japan, was called Rockman X Cyber

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:56.740
Mission and Rocksman X2, Soul Eraser, which is just a freaking cool name, came out of

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:57.740
them.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:05.660
And then, we've also had Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, which was the re-release for PSP.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:11.660
So I mean, basically, he's got different abilities apart from just, you know, the shooting and

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.420
you kill the robot, you get the power, blah, blah, blah.

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.980
He can also dash and you can get an air dash later on.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.360
Get all these power-ups.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.020
You can also charge your weapon too, which is really useful.

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:31.420
That means you can also charge your, um, the weapons that you inherit from other Mavericks.

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.100
So that's pretty cool.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:38.420
And um, they have interesting names, some of these Mavericks, like Toxic Seahorse.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:44.780
But they're pretty much element-based, you know, you get your fire, water, lightning,

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.900
wind, magnetism, time, all kinds of stuff.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:53.480
So uh, really there's not much else, you know, I can really say about that because it's freaking

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.420
Mega Man X and if you haven't played it, where have you been?

01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.420
Go play it!

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.700
There's billions and billions of versions out there to try.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:04.500
Some comments from our chatroom at chat.ownersontrader.com, Hitstun says, actually I played this game

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.180
on PC first.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.380
There was a PC demo that was just the intro stage until Sigma showed up, but I thought

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.380
it was awesome.

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.860
I do remember this game on PC, actually.

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.860
Yeah.

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.860
There was a PC port.

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.940
There was an old-ass Mega Man game on PC that was really terrible, it was only like three

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:17.940
stages.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.660
Anyway, but that's not X.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.180
But anyway, uh, let's see.

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:26.900
Um, also I got schooled because I said earlier, remember I said back when we didn't have 3D

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:27.900
games and all that?

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.620
Act Def said we had 3D Rad Racer.

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.980
Aww, I got burned.

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.980
Burned total.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.980
I did.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.980
The shutter glasses that came out with the raster system.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:37.980
No, it was red-blue.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.980
Red-blue, oh yeah.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980
No, but there was a lasaxon 3D.

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980
Yes.

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:42.980
Yes.

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.980
Yeah, the shutter glasses.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.540
Alright, so I guess we did have 3D gaming back then.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.540
I got told.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.660
Dude, what are you doing?

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:48.980
Not really in the Super Nintendo era.

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.260
Are you playing Saints Row?

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.420
Loki is playing Saints Row with his dildo bat.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.500
Are you gonna hit somebody in the face with your dildo bat?

01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:00.740
You just- Okay, this is terrible radio if I watch this.

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.740
Good.

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:02.740
It's floppy!

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.020
He literally- Who wants a floppy dildo?

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:09.660
He literally threw a guy to the ground and then posed like, hey, like a little swimsuit

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:12.020
model pose on the guy.

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.300
Who- Wow.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.340
What's the purpose of having a floppy dildo?

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:20.300
You just kicked that fat guy in the crotch and then whapped him with your dildo.

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.300
They kicked a woman.

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.300
That was a woman.

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.300
That was a woman.

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.300
That was a pat.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:26.300
It was a pat.

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.300
Alright.

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:31.340
Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:32.980
Make a man X.

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.220
Good pick, Dark Sakura.

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.220
Good pick.

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.220
I know.

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:37.220
Thank you.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:38.220
Alright.

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.220
We're gonna take a break, but don't go anywhere.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.220
Those of you on the podcast will only be gone like five seconds, but those of you live, don't

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.080
go anywhere because we're gonna be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:51.900
Your emails, which finally came through, phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, rapid fire news,

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:56.260
talk of a Tumblr post that's taking everybody by storm, but I'm gonna be a bitch about it.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.340
So stay tuned for that.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:58.340
We'll be back.

01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.340
What's new?

01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.340
Shut up.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.340
We'll be back.

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:04.100
See, we'll be back in just a few more minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:10.940
Don't go anywhere.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.740
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:20.900
We are live with the 435th episode of our show on this November the 13th of 2011.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.620
And during the break there, I was watching Loki play a little bit of Saints Row the Third,

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.120
which he has hooked up here in studio, which he's playing.

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.220
And he's just running around punching people in the face.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.800
This game is very purple.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.780
Like I know I was getting that in the art and everything, but like the game, the nights,

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.660
the sky is all lit up purple and the pause is purple.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.140
This is a purple people leader game.

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.660
Well, the reason why a lot of it's purple is because...

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:43.340
Is that like your game color?

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:47.340
Yes, it's your game color and also as you start taking over territories, you'll see

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:52.340
a lot of the lights turn purple and they kind of indicate, you know, that you've taken it

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.340
over.

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.340
Gotcha.

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:55.340
All right.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.340
Well, there you go.

01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:57.340
Saints Row.

01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.340
We are live.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:03.260
You can join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and comment on some of the rapid fire news

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.260
we're about to get to.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.140
So Loki, you got to pause Saints Row to go over some rapid fire news.

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.140
Yes.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:11.660
And we'll talk a little bit more about Saints Row because Saints Row 4 has already been

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:17.980
out by, you know, the guys over at THQ and not a big surprise because I think this game

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.800
is going to do well for them, but let's see here.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:30.380
It was Danny Bilson, the executive vice president and apparently, you know, he was saying that

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:35.340
the fourth game is going to be even more over the top than the third game and he already

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:43.420
knows what the, uh, the premise is about and Saints Row in space.

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:44.420
Loki just pointed at me.

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.220
Well, you think that's it?

01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.580
Let's not, let's get, not get ahead of ourselves.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:51.100
Well, you said more over the top than this one.

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:56.900
I mean, like how did the Friday the 13th series end up going like just too far over the top

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.460
by sending Jason to space?

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.300
That is part of the DLC actually.

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:10.620
It's pimps in space or like a gangsters in space is literally the, uh, yes, it is part

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.620
of the DLC.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:15.820
I'm not sure if you actually go to space, but it's one of them.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:16.820
All right.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:17.820
Fair enough.

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:18.820
Um, so yeah, interesting.

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:21.940
Um, and then, uh, this of course this is kind of cool.

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:27.840
Uh, they're going to be doing a free to play MMO for the, um, are based on game of thrones,

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.220
the book and TV series and actually just finished watching the first season of that.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:37.460
So it's kind of cool and it kind of a coincidentally, uh, also Atlas announced that they're going

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:42.900
to be publishing game of thrones on xbox 360 and PlayStation three coming up this March

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.900
if I remember correctly.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:51.580
Um, so yeah, uh, lots of stuff based on that property I guess cause it is pretty, it's

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:52.580
pretty good actually.

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.580
People like that show.

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.580
Yeah.

01:27:54.580 --> 01:28:00.020
Um, and then of course, last but not least, uh, dead island is receiving a patch which

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.900
will do a few things.

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:10.740
Also gonna be raising the level cap to a 60 and um, you know, they also included us some

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:16.180
new blueprints for weapon mods added, um, infected damage reduce and a bunch of other

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.940
gameplay improvements.

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:22.760
Also some fixes to the interface and just improve stability and network performance

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.780
and co-op and that kind of stuff.

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:30.920
So, um, neat, uh, in our chat room, a chat, I don't know, it sounds really calm or a little

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:31.920
bit buffered here.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.740
So the chat is just now here in the saints row story and uh, um, orange right in our

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.300
chat room says pimps at sea.

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.580
Is there a, is there saints row on the ocean?

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:45.340
Is there pirates versus ninjas in saints row?

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:50.700
Uh, you can have pirates or ninjas as, uh, well I don't know about pirates, but I know

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.380
you can have ninjas in your gang.

01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.380
Okay.

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:57.060
I was gonna say, maybe that's, that's some of their, they could go with it.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:00.620
I mean you can dress up like a pirate on the high seas, you dress up pretty much like anything

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:01.620
you want.

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.620
All right.

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:03.660
All right.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.540
And game guru says pimps in space.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.540
Okay.

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.100
I really need to get into saints row.

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.380
All right.

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:13.660
Moving on to, and THQ gives you no kickback Loki, right?

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.380
You really are just that big a fanboy for saints row.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.380
I like the game.

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:17.380
It's great.

01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:18.380
There you go.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.380
All right.

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:20.380
Uh, I like this game too.

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:24.740
It's going to be 13 and it's getting a sequel 13 two is coming out as if there weren't enough

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740
games coming out.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.220
But the good news is this one's not out till early, early next year.

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:31.560
There are going to be some special edition, uh, packages for the game.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.340
Now I'm going to report on what's coming out in Europe.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:38.160
However, apparently a lot of this is going to be coming to North America as well.

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.180
So there is going to be a collector's edition that will come with special packaging and

01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:47.420
a game, a composer soundtrack, CD, an artwork book, six postcards featuring CG artwork of

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.900
the characters and a lenticular art print of lightning, who isn't even the main character

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:52.900
in the game.

01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:53.900
So go figure.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:57.420
There's also, I guess, a crystal edition that comes with all that, but instead of a single

01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:03.460
CD, you get a four disc soundtrack and you get a final fantasy 13 two t-shirt that you

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.440
can't get anywhere else.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.340
And of course, I guess like a little presentation box.

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.740
So a lot of the same pre-order stuff will be coming to America as well, because Hey,

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.140
if you're going to, if you're going to spend 60 bucks on a game, why not spend 80 and get

01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.620
a free t-shirt and soundtrack, huh?

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.620
Sure.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.620
Sure.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.500
You got to really love that though.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:26.580
There are some other black Friday deals here that we wanted to mention real quick.

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:32.300
Uh, at this part, there is, uh, some special bundles coming out and one of them of note

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:35.180
is a Zelda 3DS bundle.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.900
That's going to be like a special edition.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:39.480
And a lot of these have been cited around the internet.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.060
This is making its way to the U S for one 79.

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:47.380
It's a black system that comes with the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time 3d.

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:52.820
There's also going to be a flare red that comes with Mario 3d land that is both available

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:53.820
at Walmart.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:59.140
Uh, apparently GameStop is also going to have a similar, uh, bundle going on, but unfortunately

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:01.340
they're not like special branded systems.

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.340
They're just the regular.

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:07.660
Oh, I thought they had the Zelda artwork on, uh, only in Europe and boo, hiss and stuff.

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:12.540
Um, yeah, only the plain Jane system when I was reading about that, I thought it was

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:13.540
a special.

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:14.540
I'm glad you clarified.

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.980
Uh, some rumors about the next Xbox.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:21.860
Apparently the prototype name is loop, which is good that we have a different name for

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:22.860
it now.

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.140
Cause it's not going to be Xbox seven 20.

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.380
Why would it be Xbox seven 20?

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.380
That's a huge assumption.

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:31.700
So I like loop that that makes me think that now they're naming these after books in the

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.960
ring series.

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.960
So we'll see.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.860
Cause Hey, Xbox three 60 had a bunch of rings as their logo.

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.140
So why not have loop is the next one.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.140
Anyhow.

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:44.380
I guess as some type of inside blog, you know, take it with a grain of salt, whatever, uh,

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.700
loop is the code name for it.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:53.940
It's supposed to have all this boosted technology called assistive cores inside, uh, including,

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:58.380
you know, graphics, AI, physics, sound networking, encryption sensors.

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.360
It's supposed to be smaller and cheaper than the three 60.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.960
I'm assuming that means when this three 60 initially came out, it's going to run on a

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.920
modified version of windows nine.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.780
That's not too surprising really all things considered.

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:13.420
I mean, isn't the Xbox now starting to look more and more like windows eight and some

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.940
of the prototypes are showing that it's running on windows nine and they're like, some of

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:21.220
the rumors I've been hearing are like, it's going to be out next year, either late next

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:25.780
year or early next, uh, the, you know, 2013 I'm like, so they're going to go through eight

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.780
that fast.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.860
Well, if it's a modified windows nine, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation there.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.420
Um, so who knows?

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:38.300
So whatever we're going to have, have rumors galore, we won't have anything solid till

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.660
eight and I'm not surprised either because I think that they're going to be windows eight.

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:46.260
One of the things about that is they're going to do a lot of, you know, compatibility with

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.580
different arm processors and stuff.

01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:52.300
So if they're, you know, trying to make it so that can run on pretty much everything,

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.860
um, that wouldn't surprise me.

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.540
Why does the chat room think I said Xbox three 60 lube?

01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.540
Did I say lube?

01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.540
He said lube.

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.940
I said lube lube would be a fun name.

01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:04.980
I don't know why they're all like, did he say the Xbox lube?

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:09.340
Then it would be a smooth move.

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.420
Now I kind of like the name Xbox lube.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.660
We're getting you ready.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:18.020
That'll be the, uh,

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:24.580
that'll be the, uh,

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.580
love it.

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580
All right.

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:31.520
It's now we are now officially calling the next Xbox, the Xbox lube, especially in light

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.600
of the recent hackings of money that's been taken.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.540
And it seems very appropriate that it would be lubing you up to, uh, have stuff stolen

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.900
from you.

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:43.340
The Xbox lube awful coming in 2013 coming.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.660
All right.

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:49.140
Dark Sakura, I'm feeling kind of nauseous now.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.780
Kaijuto says, I like Xbox lube.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.540
The blue Ray will slide in better.

01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:56.940
So how about some dragon quest 10?

01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.340
If you are in the Japanese beta, you get a free hat.

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:04.500
Notice I said the Japanese beta, because it's only the beta in Japan.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.540
You have to have a Japanese query mix account to be able to sign up for it.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:13.520
So not Japan sucks to be you, well, it does suck anyway, but anyway.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.460
So how about some Bioshock infinite?

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.380
It's going to have a special move peripheral.

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:26.460
Um, it, uh, well it says it will draw you deeper into the version, this vision of a

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:31.820
parallel future, blah, blah, blah, um, but we don't know what it is.

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.100
I bet it's a hose.

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.300
Actually they confirm that that's not actually happening.

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.300
No.

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.300
Okay.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.620
Well saints row, the third, how about that dildo that you were playing with?

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.060
It was floppy.

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:48.900
Well, um, for the Japanese version, the penetrator has been censored.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:54.760
The veins and physics from the dildo was meant to be removed because they have stricter

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.500
guidelines on how you can display a phallus.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.100
And I think they also took out the balls as well.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:06.320
Uh, I do not believe the testicles were on the penetrator.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.300
This is very serious, Rob, why are you laughing?

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:13.440
I'm sorry, they have effectively neutered the weapon.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.560
It looks like a purple vibrator now.

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.400
It's totally gonna throw everything off.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.860
My favorite is that all these very serious game blogs had to report, well yes, I had

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.980
to make the dildo less veiny.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:27.980
You know what?

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:28.980
Had to take out his floppy physics.

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:29.980
You know what?

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:34.080
It would be awesome to have, they gave this out and of course they can't do this out over

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:39.440
here because it would be tasteless, but in certain other countries like Denmark and Finland

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:46.680
or whatever, uh, they were actually shipping them recreations of the penetrator, actual

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.940
size recreations of the penetrator.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:52.860
It's a giant four foot long dildo on a stick.

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:53.940
On a baseball bat.

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:57.480
On a baseball bat that these, uh, blog people had.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.320
I would display that proudly if- I'm looking for pictures.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.320
Go to Kotaku.

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.320
Kotaku.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320
Kotaku has that.

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.360
Oh yeah, because she's got to post them in the Orange Launch Radio Tumblr account because

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.520
we haven't really been posting a lot over there tonight, so here you go.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:19.540
Alright, um, I wanted to- They show what it looks like in Japan and it's, um, rigid.

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.540
Very rigid.

01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.320
Beautiful.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.320
Alright moving on to, uh, talking about- This is actually from Tumblr.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.280
I wanted to talk about this real quick before we get into some long form news because I

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:34.040
saw this around Twitter and this is a nice story.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.840
I want to share this nice story with you guys and see what you guys think about it, okay?

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:43.440
So, um, this- I got to abridge this because I don't want to read this verbatim, but, uh,

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.440
where is this coming from?

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.760
I think the original Tumblr user that posted this was iHeartChaos, was the original post

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:55.400
of this, um, and it says, I just got back from the midnight release of the game Skyrim.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.560
And he's talking about there's a 13 year old boy there and he got a new copy of the game

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:04.440
and five feet out the door some douchebag took it, ran off with it, and the kid was

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.040
obviously about to burst into tears.

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.840
He'd ridden his bike two miles in the cold at night to get the game.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.480
He actually had sold a bunch of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and did housework for his parents to

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:19.080
get it and the guy who wrote this said, I had an idea, save my place in line, and he

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.520
went through the line, told other people about the situation, collected a bunch of money,

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.280
five bucks here and there and so forth, and he was able to raise the money for a new copy,

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.280
bought the kid a new copy and the kid was, you know, very thankful about it and so forth

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.880
and the kid said, do you need anything in return?

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.280
And the guy says, I told him, young man, I just hope one day you'll do something equally

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:40.280
nice for someone.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.600
So, you know, it's a very, it's a very inspiring pay it forward type of story, right?

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.000
So it's very, very nice.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.360
Does anyone now, and I read this on Twitter and I was like, that's sweet, but I mean,

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:55.560
I'm going to be a bitch here because there's something kind of really wrong with this story.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.920
Did anyone else pick up on it?

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920
Yep.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.920
I picked up on it.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.920
What did you pick up on, Loki?

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:02.140
I picked up on the fact, first off, it's a child.

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.140
That's right.

01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.140
In an M rated game.

01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:05.140
That's right.

01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:08.040
Loki, I said at the very beginning, it was a 13 year old who rolled his bike and sold

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.160
his Yu-Gi-Oh cards to get a midnight.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160
Was it a midnight launch?

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160
A midnight launch.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.360
Oh, his parents are wonderful.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.640
If now, this is going to sound really rude, but this is the point when you start to look

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.840
at, at situations like that, do you go, is this story real?

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.640
Maybe the story's not real like, and I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say,

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.600
but I think I have a right to be skeptical because what parent, let's say a 13 year old

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.560
ride their bike at midnight at night.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.560
I mean, I guess there's some crazy people out there, but it does, it does well and see

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.480
what happens when that, when you do let your 13 year old out at midnight and seriously,

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.160
why are people like robbing people of games?

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.400
I mean, that's, I mean, that's that part shitty.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.880
Go like steal it from a store or something sadly, you know, and then there's that part

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:56.480
and it makes me go, well, you know, that definitely could be legit that somebody is going to steal

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.680
an X-Box game right out of a kid's hands.

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.780
I mean, that's really fucking classy, but unfortunately there's some people in this

01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:09.400
world that are just not have no class whatsoever and would do something like that, but you

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.880
know, there's also that part of me that's like, but it's a 13 year old trying to buy

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.160
an M rated game.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.400
The game starts, I don't mean to be all spoilery, but within the first five minutes of playing

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:24.220
Skyrim, you're going to see some guy get his head chopped off old style execution style.

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.560
And it's like, do you want your 13 year old to see that?

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.680
Maybe not like some 13 year olds can probably handle it.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:36.120
I watched red Sonia when I was what, seven, but that was your parents' choice.

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:43.600
No it wasn't and you didn't ride two miles in the dark at midnight to go do it.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.520
Maybe the parents let the kid did this.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.720
Maybe the parents let the kid did this and that's fine, whatever.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.720
He's not my kid.

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:55.360
But then I go, but the store and effectively allowed this perfect stranger to buy an M

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.320
rated game for a 13 year old.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.940
I mean, regardless of the reason, isn't that not supposed to be happening?

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:04.520
That is not supposed to be happening.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:10.760
So now, now my other question is, am I a bitch for my mind instantly going here?

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:16.600
Well let me, on a feel good, warm, fuzzy wuzzy, gamers do good story.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.640
No he didn't do good cause he, he basically bought the game.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:25.380
He should have, I don't know, whatever, his parents should have taken care of it.

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.520
So all right, is it wrong that I'm color correcting this picture of a dildo?

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.520
You're just really bored.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.360
All right, wait a minute, you're doing a show.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360
How can you be bored?

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.760
Uh, because I'm putting it on the...

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.840
Moving on, let's get to some more gaming news, Loki.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:48.920
So of course, you know, one of the things that's popular nowadays is online passes.

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.400
And you know, as much as I love Saints Row the Third, this is kind of fucked up.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.080
And it's basically with their, their online pass.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:01.560
Okay, I kind of figured that this game would have an online pass.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.360
My problem with it is that, say I didn't want to play online.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:12.020
Say I bought the game, cause it has system link, praise system link, awesome.

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.640
And I want to play with my friend, um, you know, over system link.

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.240
In order for me to do that, I have to put in an online pass code.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.240
That's right.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.460
If I bought this game used, and I had no intention to play it online at all, I wanted to play

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:27.520
it system link, I would have to pay $10 to get a code.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.960
An online pass to play offline.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:31.960
What is up with that?

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.420
But yes, that is the case, um, you know, they have a screenshot of the actual online pass

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.420
code.

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.360
I have my own online pass code, and yeah, you can do it.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:47.800
Oh, and of course, you know, because the comp is early, it's not actually on the site yet,

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.640
so I can't actually play co-op with anybody yet.

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.800
But uh, that's fucked up.

01:41:53.800 --> 01:42:00.680
I mean, I thought the whole point of these online passes, and it's not even me calling

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.680
it an online pass.

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.760
It's not like, you know, okay this is an Ubi Uplay thing, this is gonna unlock bonus contents.

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:10.260
It says, your online pass code.

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.320
So if I'm not playing this online, and the whole reason that you're charging this is

01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:20.360
because online servers cost money to run, then, then basically you're just taking money

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.960
for the hell of it.

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.400
You know, um, I don't know.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.840
I mean, you should have had system link outside of it.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.960
Now, here's why they don't have system link outside of it.

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.380
Because they know this game's gonna get pirated, and they also know that there are ways that

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:38.100
you can play online co-op with somebody else via system link.

01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:42.540
And that's why they put this behind a code, because if they're gonna at least make some

01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:47.540
money off this pirated copy, if you're gonna play online and play co-op, whether it be

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:50.720
through system link or whatever, then they're gonna make $10 off it.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.440
That's the true reason why it's like this.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.120
But still, for legitimate people that, you know, wanna play this game, say buy it used

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120
or whatever.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.680
It's a further case of legitimate buyers getting screwed over, anti-piracy measures that'll

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.160
get hacked to shit anyway.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.720
Yeah, I mean, because I agree this game's awesome, and you should buy it, and, you know,

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.240
if you can buy it new, great, because I think you should play it sooner than later, but

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:17.440
not everyone can buy it new, and you shouldn't be expected to have to pony out, you know,

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:20.520
money for something that maybe you're not sure that you'd like it or something.

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:24.200
Well, granted, but when you do buy the game new, you don't, I mean, we have to remember

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.480
that online passes don't affect those that buy new.

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.760
Yeah, but it's still, it still ain't, well, and actually, no, it does kind of affect me

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:37.880
if buying it new, because I plan a lot of different systems that work, so if I wanna

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:44.640
play system link co-op now, I can only play on my system, and, you know, I'd have to get

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.140
another copy new.

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:49.440
You can't, like, download the data to USB and then go to a friend's house and put the

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.440
USB in there?

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.440
No.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.440
Oh, wow.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.440
I don't think so.

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.440
I think it's tied to your system.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440
Could it be tied to your account?

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.440
It might be tied to your account.

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.440
You might be able to do it.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.440
Yeah.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.080
Even still, though, I would have to log in online anyways to play system link, you know,

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.240
because you have to download, it's DLC, basically.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240
Oh, yeah.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.800
So DLC is usually tied to your system.

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.920
Right.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.400
And you can't play the same account on two systems to system link, can you?

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:13.400
No.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.700
Ah, see, that's the trick.

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:18.640
So you are kind of getting screwed in that regard.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.040
Yep.

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:26.080
Hmm, well, it's a, it's a good thing to know before the game comes out, I think, especially

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.120
for people who might be considering buying it, waiting to get it used or whatever.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.440
Well, and here's the thing, though.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.580
They didn't tell anybody it was gonna have this.

01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:38.600
It was just, it happened to be a reviewer or whatever said, hey, it has an online pass.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600
It's something to report on.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.960
They didn't tell, you know, anybody, like, if that reviewer hadn't said anything, you

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.080
know, I'm sure, obviously, it's gonna get out there early and people would say something,

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.760
but let's just say, devil's advocate here, that no one said anything.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.400
THQ would have not said anything.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.320
You would get home with your copy of the game.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.400
You're like, what the fuck is this?

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400
And they already have your 60 bucks.

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.840
But now you're getting used, you're getting used to seeing those things in every game.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.640
Yeah, but, and I have no problem with games that, you know, if they want to charge that

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.240
because they're saying, okay, well, we need to fund our servers or whatever the case may

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.440
be, you know, and it's an online game.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.320
I have a problem with it on Xbox 360.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:21.700
I'm already paying 50 bucks a month for that.

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.480
Why is, why are Microsoft games allowed to charge for this?

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:31.080
And now, granted, Microsoft first party games haven't done it because they know better because

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.760
we're gonna go apeshit on them when they try to pull that shit because that's true double

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.240
dipping right there.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.240
But right now, it's really only the third parties that are doing it.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.200
And now Sony, but Sony, you know, Sony's online thing is free already.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:50.960
I mean, I give this way more justification on the PlayStation than I do on the Xbox because

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.760
I'm already paying 50 bucks a month to play online on the Xbox.

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.960
Yeah.

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.160
That's kind of what pisses me off about the online pass in that regard.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.120
But anyhow, rumors abound that a new Zelda game is on its way.

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:11.520
It's being made for the 3DS series producer, Eiji Onuma, talked to a Portuguese website,

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:16.240
My Games, and said the following, quote, we are already preparing a new game, a game in

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:20.600
the series for the Nintendo 3DS, but don't think that it is a direct sequel to the Zelda

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.480
titles released on DS.

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.280
We are talking about a new game, but it takes much of what has been done on previous handhelds.

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.560
Some folks are saying, is this sort of Majora's Mask?

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.160
I'm actually thinking no.

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:36.520
I think, you know, I'm kind of reading really a lot into this, but I think it's definitely

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.840
a new Zelda title, which kind of seems like a duh.

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.280
There's gonna be the major Nintendo franchises, but look at everything that's kind of been

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280
leading up to this.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.060
You know, Nintendo has been talking about, yeah, we need more big releases on the 3DS,

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:52.160
and we have some things that are coming in 2012 that we're not ready to announce yet.

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:58.600
I think Zelda 3DS is probably the big thing that's being unveiled next E3 on the 3DS.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:02.600
I mean, duh, right?

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.880
It's gonna be some big first party game, and if they're gonna refuse to give me F-Zero

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.840
another year, then it's gonna be probably Zelda.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.640
Most likely.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.560
This doesn't surprise me at all.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.820
And I don't want it to be Majora's Mask.

01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:22.660
I get that some people want that remade too, whatever, fine, but I think I'd rather just

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.800
have a new Zelda game.

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.100
Why not a new experience?

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.500
The Mario game's apparently pretty good, so they're capable of taking the old franchises

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.000
and making them fun in 3D.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.480
Why not Zelda?

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.200
I'm sure it'll be a new game.

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.200
It'll be cool.

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.840
Hopefully it won't take five years to develop.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.180
We'll see though.

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:44.080
Let's get to the mailbag.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:49.400
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer's

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:55.040
gonna dive into the email bag and pick out the one email that came in this week that's

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.040
worth reading.

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.640
Well, we have all the rest of those, fam.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.300
Now, I realize a lot of you have been busy playing Modern Warfare and Skyrim and Mario

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.520
and so forth, but let's make her work next week.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.280
We want to hear no opinions on the panel tonight about Modern Warfare.

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.480
I need emails on Modern Warfare.

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:14.440
Tell me why this sold nine million copies or whatever the first day.

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:15.440
I need to understand.

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.840
I'm not hating on the game.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.840
I just want to know.

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.840
Hater.

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:19.840
I'm not hating on it.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.840
It's just not my type of game.

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:21.840
Hater's gonna hate.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:24.440
But I want to know why other people get so riled up about it.

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.440
Can I read the email?

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:26.440
Yes.

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.440
Hey, Orange Loungers.

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.680
It's Jim Sally.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.440
I live for holiday deals.

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:35.120
I've gotten everything from cheap games online and stood in line for big screen TVs.

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.640
What's the best holiday deal you ever got?

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:43.800
Once I bought an original, I said original, original Xbox 5.1 sound system for $75 on

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.520
Boxing Day because it was a return.

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.080
At least the guy in the parking lot with his trunk open said so.

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.080
Mmm.

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.080
Thanks, guys.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.480
Sundays are orange forever, Jim Sally.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.360
Yeah, I'd recommend never buying something out of a trunk, not that I would ever do that.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:04.520
Actually, no, I have never done that, so, but, you know, they tend to sell you stereo

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:11.440
systems that are actually brick painted black and stuff like that, so, you know.

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.120
I would say the best holiday deal I ever got was my HDTV for $600.

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.160
Keep in mind, this was in the year, I think, 2004.

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.380
I got it at Costco, and it was back when HDTVs were not flat.

01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:26.120
They had the giant backs like the old school TVs still.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.920
That thing was heavy as hell.

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.640
That was a big TV.

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:33.200
Did I get that when I was living with you, Loki, or was that, that was when I was living

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.200
with Extifer.

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:40.680
I finally got that, but that was only $600, which then was, like, dirt cheap for an HDTV.

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:43.120
I don't know if you remember that TV the other time.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:46.560
You know where you can see that TV?

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:52.200
It's in the news report that Channel 3 did on us that somebody put up on YouTube.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.280
You're playing DDR on that old TV.

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.280
Let me see if I can find it.

01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280
Yeah.

01:49:58.280 --> 01:49:59.280
This is a good time to revisit that on YouTube, too.

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:02.520
I thought I was playing DDR on, uh- You were playing on the cabinet.

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:03.520
On the cabinet?

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.520
Yeah, you were playing on the cabinet.

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.520
No, no, no.

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:06.520
That was when The B did the article.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:12.040
That was the Sacramento B. Well, the one with the rock band, not rock band, but guitar hero

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.040
was here at my house.

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.040
No, no.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.080
He's talking about the, uh- On my old TV.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:22.400
Don't you remember the, don't you remember the It's So Much Fun story that led to that

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.400
whole thing?

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.280
Don't you remember that?

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.280
That was, oh, look.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280
I found it.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.280
I found it here.

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.280
It's still on YouTube.

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.280
Look at this.

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:35.280
We're joining the podcasting craze that's becoming a web craze, but what is it?

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:36.280
How does it work?

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:42.000
KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.200
and share their thoughts with the world.

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.760
It's Jamie Speed.

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:50.800
It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game-

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:51.800
There.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.800
There's the ginormous TV.

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:53.800
Remember that guy?

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:54.800
Yeah.

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.800
I got that for 600 bucks.

01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.560
That was a steal back then.

01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.080
October 9th, 2006, but anyway.

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:05.320
Now that I have this up- I was thinking of the Wega, but the Wega was, um, dude's TV.

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.420
Now that we're, this is a five-year-old clip now.

01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:08.420
Now I want to watch the rest of it.

01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:09.420
No, I don't want to watch it.

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:15.480
It started off tiny and it's grown.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:16.480
That's what she said.

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.480
No, we're not playing this.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.120
No, I gotta hear that again.

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.080
It started off tiny and it's grown.

01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:30.480
A subculture of pop culture, and these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480
fans.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:32.480
A cliche thing.

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.480
That's a cliche thing.

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.400
Hello everybody once again, and welcome to-

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.960
Remember that ginormous green chair we had randomly in the old studio in the Extrofer

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:45.960
apartment?

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.960
The one I would sleep in sometimes?

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:48.360
Oh my God, that chair is gigantic.

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.360
Anyway, sorry.

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:55.120
...of our podcast from their apartment in Rancho Cordova using revolutionary technology.

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:56.120
Oh my God.

01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:58.560
That was my old laptop that's in the garage now.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.240
Look how young we are in this picture.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.400
Like especially look at Loki.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.960
Like he looks so much younger in this clip.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.960
And I had hair.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960
It's amazing.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.960
I look the same.

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.960
I bet we will do that to you.

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:08.960
Except your hair is shorter.

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:09.960
And it's a different color.

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960
...for the world.

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:17.240
We basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.240
want to know.

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:23.000
Using a computer, podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.520
of websites now hosting the shows.

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:31.400
Now anyone can create, edit, and air their ideas, concerns, music, and all things audio

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.840
to anyone else willing to download it.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:35.480
It's something they can take with them.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:39.260
It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.

01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:44.120
With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:48.160
I love that they just interviewed some random dude bro, like who had his iPod with him.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.760
He's skating down the street.

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.480
People can talk about things they like to talk about and other people can join in and

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.480
listen to.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.980
And it's really open and lots of people can get into it.

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:02.060
A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free.

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:06.700
The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes.

01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:11.480
You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature, and a list of

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:14.200
available podcasts are at your fingertips.

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.200
Free for you.

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.500
Free for the producers.

01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.880
Free speech for everyone.

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:19.880
It's so much fun.

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:20.880
It's great.

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.480
They can go eat a dick, okay?

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.480
Interview me for a minute and a half.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.440
Let's play this two-second clip.

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.960
They never show Loki's name, his real name.

01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:34.120
They never show anything but that one little clip, oh, it's so much fun.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:38.120
And then me talking about something a little more profound.

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.520
Free for the producers.

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:41.920
Free speech for everyone.

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.920
It's so much fun.

01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:46.600
It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:49.360
heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.720
So podcasting is just wonderful.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.360
In Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 reports.

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360
I got to say more than everybody.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.360
That was kind of cool.

01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:01.480
Recently, Governor Schwarzenegger began providing his weekly radio address as a podcast.

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:06.600
It can be downloaded, so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:08.920
pumping iron in the gym.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:09.920
That's right.

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:11.960
We were mentioned in the same breath as Governor Schwarzenegger.

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.560
Yes, he really was the governor of California, if you weren't aware, he really, really was

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.560
the governor.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.600
Did you notice that overhead cam shot trying to get my boobs?

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:20.600
Seriously.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.800
The cameraman fancied you.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:23.800
Whatever.

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.000
It's just because I'm a girl.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.080
And by the way, here's my favorite.

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.180
Here's my favorite thing about that whole story.

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:34.320
Our show is never named.

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.920
They never say they don't want to have free advertising ever said, but when you when you

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.000
watch him search, he's searching for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.840
That was the shout out we got.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:47.240
But never did they say these three guys produce a show called Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:48.240
Nope.

01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.880
They play DDR and it's so much fun.

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:56.000
And it's it started off tiny and it's grown.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.200
Cutting edge technology.

01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.560
These failed, crappy laptops.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.880
These guys are doing what Governor Schwarzenegger is doing.

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.560
Pumping iron.

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.560
Doing drugs.

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:15.120
We are not making poor decisions.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.120
All right.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.120
Let's move on.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.120
Is that it for e-mails?

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:19.960
Oh, holiday deals.

01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:24.440
We never we took a trip down memory lane and just totally ignored Jim Sally's one more

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:25.440
e-mail.

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.440
I mentioned the TV.

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.240
Did anybody else get any really good holiday deals?

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:29.240
They can remember.

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.240
I don't remember.

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.240
I don't care.

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:37.920
I used to buy like different like media and stuff, you know, like seedy blanks and stuff

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:44.120
like that, because they usually have some good deals on those, at least during the holidays.

01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:49.160
That was the only thing I could see you'd like going to like Best Buy or something for.

01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:50.720
All right.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:54.640
Mail bag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some e-mails in the future.

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:55.640
All right.

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.640
After that trip down memory lane, I'm sure that's going to ignite some fury amongst some

01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.640
people.

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.640
That's going to be part of the show we call the FUs of the week.

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:24.680
I don't know, I guess just to feeling crappy.

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.560
Yeah, F you to feeling crappy and F you to shame.

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.880
Why is he getting an F you?

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.040
Because I've listened to like a lot of Manson and every time I can't help it.

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.440
He's got me liking a group that I can't get any new stuff from anymore.

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.440
Oh yeah.

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.440
Didn't they like break?

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:44.880
They broke up years ago, but I just recently heard of them.

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.880
Thanks to him.

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:46.880
That group died, too.

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:53.760
I don't know, but I'm mad at Shane only marginally, and I'm also mad at Shane for not catching

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.880
up on Supernatural.

01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:57.920
So I can't talk to him about it.

01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:58.920
Sorry.

01:56:58.920 --> 01:56:59.920
This is our chat room.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:03.040
Cause we were talking about the similarities between orange launch radio and governor Schwarzenegger,

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:04.040
right?

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.640
Kossin in the chat says, which one of the OLR hosts diddled the maid and salacious pop

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:12.820
follows that up saying, is OLR going to suddenly reveal a 10 year old offspring from a Latina

01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:16.040
domestic servant because that's something governor Schwarzenegger did.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.520
The show is the right age.

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.520
We got really drunk after our second episode.

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:20.520
Don't ask how this happened.

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:24.480
Hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, physically capable of that.

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:25.480
So shut up.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:30.680
No, I Loki or I could have boinked a maid, but, oh, that's right.

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.760
I'm not a Latina maid.

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.760
You definitely are not a Latina maid.

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:35.760
Please.

01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.000
All right.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
FUs of the week.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Uh, Loki.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.640
Um, I would say my, if he goes through those people, I know I'm not sure if you've seen

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.280
these, but they have these little signs that show how fast you're going and stuff like

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.280
that.

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.600
It's, you know, kind of a reminder to do the speed limit or under the speed limit.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.640
I always, always speed up when I see them.

01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.720
Well, I see people like see those signs and they like slam on their brakes.

01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:02.000
I'm like, dude, it's a fucking sign.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.400
It's not going to write you a ticket.

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:04.720
It's a sign.

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:09.680
That's all it does is it showed you how fast you're going and not accurately by the way.

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:13.700
My favorite thing to find out with those signs is how high it will track you before it starts

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:16.160
getting angry and starts blinking.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:19.080
Like I always like to see like, what's the speed limit where it starts flashing, slow

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.820
down asshole.

01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:25.920
So yeah, so I feed those people that think signs are real people that are going to write

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:26.920
them tickets or something.

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.120
It doesn't have a magical camera on it.

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.480
I'm sure someday the signs will be able to write you a ticket and governments are hard

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:33.800
up enough for the money.

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:34.800
I guess.

01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:35.800
All right.

01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:40.720
Uh, my FU of the week goes to the headache I had today because headaches are terrible

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.480
and yeah, it made me want to nap all day forever.

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:46.720
Does it make you feel better Rob?

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.360
What the giant purple dildo?

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:49.360
No.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:52.840
It does not make me feel better.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:55.360
I kind of want one.

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.920
I'd hang it up in the studio.

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920
Sure.

01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920
I would.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.120
All right, let's move on with some more stories.

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.680
The Skype line coming up soon, but first more news Loki studio sext engines, same difference.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:12.480
Um, so apparently, you know, we were talking a little bit about online passes and stuff.

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:18.800
And one of the things that the online passes, if you want to call them that, um, do is basically

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:27.000
the deter use game sales and um, but there's a report that's out that's saying that basically

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.960
used in digital sales actually make up about 35% of total console spending and that's very,

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:36.720
you know, it makes sense, you know, with a lot of the stuff nowadays, you know, available

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:43.000
on the Xbox 360, uh, marketplace or, you know, the PlayStation network or even, you know,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:49.040
WiiWare stores and steam and whatever, um, it's not surprising that it would be about that much.

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:54.360
Um, they're also saying that, um, you know, they show that 23% of the consoles purchased,

01:59:54.360 --> 02:00:00.420
um, or console games purchased in the US are used and says slightly more in, uh, than the

02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:01.840
European market were.

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.200
That's about 20%.

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:11.400
Also, uh, digitally, um, just digitally distributed titles rank lower in both regions, I guess,

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:16.200
taking up 12% of console market in America and nine in Europe.

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:22.680
And also, I guess they're saying that the 12% that actually is approximately $960 million

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:25.800
worth of content that's being purchased right there.

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:31.840
Um, and, uh, they're saying that also 54% of American console owners are spending an

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:35.800
average of $49 a year on console downloads.

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:36.800
Hmm.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.440
And then, of course, uh, you know, talking a little bit about PC and you would kind of

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:45.600
think that PC is going to be skewing more towards the digital side.

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:46.600
Actually that's true.

02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:53.320
They're saying that 58% of all PC gaming dollars are spent digitally on games or DLC.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.320
So that's the way it's going in the PC market.

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:57.480
Not so much in the console market.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.560
Not surprised because you see PC retail shelves really dry.

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.560
Oh yeah.

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.560
Like it's not a surprise at all.

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.920
In fact, now even, I mean, I know we don't talk a lot about gaming on the Mac, but you

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.240
know, the app store delivery is like the big thing on the Mac now.

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:15.400
They didn't even sell the latest OS upgrade like through the app store.

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.400
I think so.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.400
Yeah.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400
I haven't had a Mac in a long time.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.120
In fact, I gave my Mac to dark soccer who I guess just recently gutted it over the weekend

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.240
or I'm actually going to be doing a reformat on it.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:27.240
It won't run Linux yet.

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.160
What exactly are you going to do with that thing?

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:32.640
I'm actually going to talk to people I know to take it apart and see about fixing the

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.640
DVD, the DVD player and seeing what I can do to get Linux on it and make it do your

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:39.640
evil bidding.

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:45.760
But I want, there's a version of Linux that's meant to run on a Mac and mirror Mac OS only

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.240
use a lot less memory and be a lot more efficient.

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:49.880
Then she's going to install the grid on it.

02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:50.880
End of line.

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:53.880
And then I'll move in.

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.300
All right.

02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.520
But anyhow, only 35% huh, you would think with all these online passes and everything

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:00.520
it was much higher.

02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:01.520
It doesn't seem so bad.

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:09.120
No, cause I think the majority of, you know, cause you're looking at dollars and the majority

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:12.080
of the stuff that's purchased online would be cheaper.

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:15.360
And also a lot of, a lot more people are, you know, lined up to go to the stores to

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:16.360
buy stuff.

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:21.560
And also not a lot of stuff is like day and date with, you know, games on, you don't have

02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:28.400
it yet where you can buy, you know, call of duty at midnight on, you know, as a digital

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:29.400
download.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.040
And I would be willing to bet if they did that, you'd probably see a lot of people going

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.040
that route.

02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:38.400
Well, steam did launch Skyrim where you could download, you know, you preload the game and

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:40.080
then you unencrypted at midnight.

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:43.680
Like they did do that for Skyrim and I think they've done it for other big games too.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.800
So like steam does that a lot, but um, I'm seeing as far as like console stuff goes,

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:51.800
um, you don't see that.

02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:52.800
That's true.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:53.800
You don't see consoles yet.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:54.800
Yet.

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:55.800
Yeah.

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.680
Wait, wait for the Xbox lube.

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.280
Cause it's going to give the lube, it's going to lube up GameStop because uh, I bet a lot

02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.380
of these new consoles are going to go very, very heavy on digital distribution.

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:08.800
So like GameStop can bend over.

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:09.800
All right.

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.800
Well, you all right?

02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:12.800
Nothing.

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.800
Just listening to what Dan's playing.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.800
All right.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.800
What is he playing?

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.800
Saints Row III.

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.800
Oh, nice.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.800
Uh, moving on.

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.600
Uh, one of the biggest complaints about the Wii U when it was announced to E3 this year

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.840
is what?

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.520
All the games will only work with the one controller, you know, because the, I guess

02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.680
the system that was not capable when they showed it at E3 of running games on multiple

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:33.680
controllers.

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:38.000
Cause you know, the touch screens, it's the, the device is basically processing the screen

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.480
and what you're seeing on the TV.

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:44.040
And so it was worrisome that, you know, you wouldn't be able to run multiple controllers.

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:49.920
Well, however, apparently, uh, some, uh, some stuff is going on behind the scenes where

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:55.920
they might actually be retooling the Wii U to work with multiple of those, uh, consoles.

02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:04.480
Uh, I guess there's a, uh, article on developonline.net that talks about Nintendo now knows they absolutely

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:07.160
need to support two tablets.

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:11.000
At E3 they didn't commit to this, but they know how important it is to make technically

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.480
feasible to support two screens.

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:16.720
And if that affects frame rate as a developer and player, I don't care.

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:18.180
It needs to work.

02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:20.520
Developers will design appropriate games for this.

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.600
If you're building a quiz game, you're not going to give a shit about the frame rate.

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.600
Hmm.

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:31.960
So apparently Nintendo is being pressured by developers to get this to work.

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:34.080
Could it end up delaying the whole system?

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.080
Maybe.

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:38.000
Loki, you've already speculated the Wii U's not coming out next year.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.200
Uh, I wouldn't be surprised.

02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.000
I wouldn't be surprised if it was 2013.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.600
How is Nintendo gonna, I mean, I was gonna say how is Nintendo gonna recover next year,

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.880
but we're hearing reports that 3DS sales are going way up because of Mario 3D Land, at

02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:52.880
least over in Japan.

02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:58.000
Well, I mean, it'll help, and I, you know, definitely what they're gonna have in the,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:06.280
you know, next year will help, but, um, I just, that's, that new system just sounds

02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:07.560
so broken right now.

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:10.440
I mean, they have nothing to show for it yet.

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:14.040
I mean, some tech demos that are basically Wii games.

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.400
It's been six months.

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:18.840
It's probably a lot further along than what we saw at E3, and it's gonna be a lot, lot

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:21.120
further, further along next E3.

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.600
So I don't think it's, it's a done deal yet.

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:28.480
I think Nintendo knows that people were not as thrilled with Wii U as they were with the

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:34.560
3DS, and I think come next E3, they're really prepared to just blow us away.

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:38.720
And I think some hardcore developers getting up on that stage, some third-party developers

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:43.840
gonna get up there and show, you know, Saints Row 4 or something on the Wii U, and how it's,

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:45.800
you know, the technology is amazing or whatever.

02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:51.800
And obviously I'm just picking that, because I know it'll, it'll get you interested.

02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:52.800
Alright.

02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:53.800
No.

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:54.800
No?

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:56.680
Are you in no way know-how buying a Wii U?

02:05:56.680 --> 02:06:00.040
No, I wouldn't say that, but I'm just saying, uh, I'm not-

02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:01.040
He's gonna steal one.

02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.040
Steal one, please.

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:08.920
No, I'm not gonna, it's not something that right now I need to have.

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:14.360
Game Guru in our chat room says, yeah, the GameCube could support four GBAs.

02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:15.760
There's a big difference there.

02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:17.520
The GBAs worked on their own.

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:22.000
The GBAs had processors and game things independent of the GameCube.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.040
That's not the case with the Wii U.

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:28.780
That little stream is base, it's basically like on live going on in your house.

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:34.200
And that little Wii U is what's, the box is streaming the image to your tablet.

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:38.520
It does have some processing power to those tablets, but they can't put a lot of processing

02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:41.080
power in there because they gotta keep the price down.

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:42.080
Right.

02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:43.080
I mean, you know.

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:46.680
But maybe this is something, maybe, you know, maybe that's something they might have to,

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:49.700
they might have to put more oomph in those tablets and make it more expensive.

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:53.120
What they should have done is they should delay this shit for another few years when

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.280
the price of those components comes down, then you can do that.

02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:00.440
Yeah, but those tablets are essentially the lower half of a DS.

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.080
How expensive can those be now?

02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:05.240
DSs are 79 bucks.

02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:08.160
I mean, like the lowest end DS is 79 bucks.

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:10.400
You can't tell me that technology is that expensive.

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:15.840
We're already expecting those tablets are gonna be $100 a pop.

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:16.840
I don't know.

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:17.840
So.

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:21.460
All I know is I think it's a big old gimmick and I'm still not buying into it yet.

02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:27.040
It's a fucking Wii with slightly better graphics and a goddamn tablet that's, what's that tablet

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:28.040
gonna do for me?

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.840
Oh, it's gonna stream some shit on it.

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:30.840
Okay.

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:31.840
Great.

02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:33.000
You know, this is shit that could have been on the screen.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.120
Oh, but we're moving the inventory.

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:36.120
Okay.

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:40.120
I, why should I spend $100 on a tablet?

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:46.920
Because the, you know, to be neat, you're gonna put the inventory screen on this tablet

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.520
instead of having push start to pop the inventory screen up.

02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:51.960
I mean, who gives a shit?

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:56.080
Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna make our frame rate and stuff drop because we really need

02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:04.840
this inventory screen to not be once again, and this is also goes to the connect too.

02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:06.740
Why can't I just do things the old way?

02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:08.600
Why can't I just push a button?

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:09.960
Inventory screen pops up.

02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:13.040
Why do I need it to be, why do I need the map always on the bottom of the screen?

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.640
If you want the map on the bottom screen, put it in the corner of the screen and be

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640
done with it.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:19.000
Why do I need the shout grenade to throw a grenade?

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
You don't have to.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.000
No, I don't have to.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.760
But that's the thing, though, is in these games, you know, why do I have to waggle my

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:25.900
controller to throw a grenade?

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:27.180
Why can't I just push a button?

02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:28.760
It's stupid.

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:30.640
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.240
All they have to do is get up on that stage and say, brand new F-Zero game coming to Wii

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:36.680
U, and I preordered.

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:37.680
That's all they would have to do.

02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:38.680
And you're part of the problem.

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:41.680
I am absolutely part of the problem, but it's F-Zero, Loki.

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.680
No, I don't care.

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:44.680
It's the best GameCube game they had.

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.680
Rah.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:49.820
You have to understand, Rob, those times are gone.

02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:52.880
They don't give a shit about F-Zero anymore, and if they do, it's gonna suck.

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:54.440
Why are you so mean, Loki?

02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.440
Because you can't be.

02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:59.440
Next thing you're gonna tell me, the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus aren't real.

02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:00.440
Uh, Rob?

02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440
What?

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.440
They're not.

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:03.440
Ahh!

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:08.000
You're just saying the Easter Bunny's not real because you're Jewish.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
What?

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Alright.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.120
You suck so much, heart.

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.480
Moving on, more news.

02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:20.440
Hopefully that won't upset me, DarkSakura.

02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.120
How about some Street Fighter stuff?

02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.120
Yeah, let's kick some ass.

02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:31.720
Well, the virtual console release of Super Street Fighter II on Genesis, you know, in

02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:35.480
Japan has Wi-Fi, so did P.O.P.O.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:43.000
But while we're getting the game, Street Fighter is not, no, yeah it is, it's actually gonna

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.720
have the Wi-Fi capability.

02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:48.360
So that's kinda cool.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.520
But why not Puyo Puyo?

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:52.600
Why not other stuff?

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:56.100
Because unfortunately Street Fighter, well I mean, not unfortunately, but you know, Street

02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:59.660
Fighter is Street Fighter, and you know, everybody likes Street Fighter.

02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:01.440
Only some people have even heard of Puyo Puyo.

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:03.760
But Street Fighter II is, you know, huge.

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.640
We should be able to play P.U.P.E.L.E.

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:06.640
anywhere.

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:11.440
But, I mean, yay for virtual console finally getting some online play capability about

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.800
oh, five years too late.

02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:16.360
Also did you hear about how they're doing this?

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:21.160
They're doing it through emulation of that, oh god, I forgot the name of it, the X-Mode,

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.440
or what, what the fuck was that thing?

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:24.440
The X-Mode?

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.440
No.

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:26.440
Now I forget.

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.440
It's that, somebody in chat will yell it out.

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.440
It's that...

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:29.440
That online Genesis thing, right?

02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.960
No, not the Sega Channel.

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.960
But it was, it was, it was Genesis and it was Super Nintendo.

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:35.960
An X...

02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:36.960
Oh!

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:42.080
And you could plug it in, and it sat between your cartridge and the console, and you could

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.120
dial into this network and play P.U.P.E.L.E. like an old, old, old-ass version of Xbox

02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:47.120
Live X-Mode.

02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:48.120
I know what you're talking about.

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:49.440
I thought, I thought that's the name of it.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.440
That's stupid.

02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:51.440
Somebody in chat will shout it.

02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:54.720
Ah, we don't want to do any work, let's just emulate this old shit.

02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.440
That's what they're doing to make it work.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:57.440
It's too stupid.

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.760
We have to build an emulator, you know...

02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:04.680
If they can do it in Japan, why can't they do it here?

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:08.560
That's what they're doing in Japan, is they're using that emulation to do it.

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.480
Of course, I'm believing everything I read on the internet, so it might not actually

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:15.480
be true, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:17.480
So...

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.480
Just silly.

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.480
Yeah.

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:23.480
X-band.

02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.480
Thank you, chatters.

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:25.480
Who said that first?

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:26.480
X-band.

02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.600
Orange Wright said it first.

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.720
Have you ever seen the X-band?

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:35.080
I think only like 7,000 of them were ever sold.

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.080
Here's a picture of it.

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:37.760
Oh, that's a tiny picture, but that's all I got.

02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:42.480
But you can kind of see how it sits between the cartridge and the console.

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:43.480
Plug it in.

02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:44.480
X-band.

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.480
Thank you.

02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:48.480
All right, Loki, what do you got for us?

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.920
All right, let's talk about Modern Warfare.

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:54.160
I know, we're saving the best for last, right?

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:59.640
Modern Warfare 3, of course, not so surprisingly, broke all sorts of records.

02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:08.760
It had the biggest launch ever for a game, and it sold 6.5 million units in one day.

02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:14.080
That's both in our total from U.S. and U.K.

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:23.560
And of course, they're saying that they were estimating 9 million units, but I'd say give

02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:24.960
it a couple weeks.

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:34.000
And of course, that puts the revenue for that game so far at 400 million dollars.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:43.640
And the previous record, of course, was 310 million dollars last year with Modern Warfare

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:44.640
2.

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:45.640
It was 310 million.

02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:47.640
Black Ops was 360 million.

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:52.400
So next year, with whatever the fuck they come out with, it'll be higher than that,

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.800
because people buy into this crap.

02:12:54.800 --> 02:13:03.120
And not to say it's a bad game, but there's a lot of people buying that game.

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:05.640
What draws everybody to this series?

02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:08.520
Popularity, I don't know.

02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:11.080
You think it's mob mentality?

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:12.080
Friends?

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:14.520
I don't know, what draws people to the world of Warcraft?

02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:15.520
They are pretty!

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.520
I've seen them.

02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.600
Friends, you're right, social aspect, absolutely.

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.800
And definitely that's something that they built up this time, so, maybe.

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:25.040
Alright, last story for you guys.

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.640
Oh, I know it draws people to it.

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:29.920
It's because of the fact that little kids get to play this game because their parents

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:30.920
suck.

02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.200
They let them go out to play launches.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.200
I don't think that's it.

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.200
Oh, really?

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.200
Yeah, I would...

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:36.200
How many...

02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:41.560
How much do you want to bet that about 1 million of that 3.6 million sold is probably people

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:44.560
under the age of 13?

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:46.200
I don't know about 13.

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.920
Under the age of 18, maybe.

02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:50.920
Definitely under the age of 18.

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:52.920
17-year-olds and 16-year-olds, I believe it.

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:56.960
Under the age of 15, I guarantee it.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:59.120
1 million at least.

02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:03.920
Alright, moving on to one more story, and then we're going to get to Twitter topics.

02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:08.480
Twitter.com slash olr and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and this is about another

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:10.160
series that's being worked on.

02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:16.240
This is kind of a duh, but it's probably nice to hear that Gran Turismo 6, yep, it's underway.

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.240
It's being developed.

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:18.240
Of course it is!

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.280
It's come out for another eight years, but yeah.

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.360
Isn't it nice to know that it's being worked on?

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.720
And I guess this is coming from Kazunori Yamauchi, who's the creator of the Gran Turismo franchise.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.540
He's the president of Polyphony Digital, and he actually, I guess, was at the Specialty

02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:37.760
Equipment Market Association industry trade show in Las Vegas, because where else do trade

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.040
shows happen?

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:42.800
And was talking a lot about some of the recent developments to Gran Turismo 5.

02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:47.920
They've done 15 updates to the game they were talking about, and that they are doing a DLC

02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:53.400
that just came out and so forth, and talking about feedback and blah blah blah blah blah.

02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.640
And somewhere in there, of course, we're working on Gran Turismo 6 already, and I think what

02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:01.960
will really be the separating factor is something that we can't update through a DLC is something

02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.400
that obviously has to be saved through Gran Turismo 6.

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:11.640
Things that we can provide through DLC we will, so that's really the market difference.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:15.640
Maybe it'll be just in time for the PlayStation 4 launch.

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:16.640
We'll see.

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:21.160
Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:25.440
if you want to give us a call and talk about anything this week, or maybe something we've

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:26.440
missed.

02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:27.440
Maybe you want to talk about modern warfare.

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:30.880
Heck, lots of people are into modern warfare, I'd like to hear some comments on that.

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:33.920
Maybe you want to talk about that Tumblr post we mentioned earlier, 13-year-olds playing

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:34.920
M-rated games.

02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.640
Saints Row the Thirds dominate a lot of conversation night, or maybe have something else that you

02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:40.160
think needs a shout out.

02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:44.080
1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.240
For everybody else, you probably want to use Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word,

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.240
on Skype.

02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:51.480
Skype us, baby, Skype us.

02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:54.800
Meanwhile, just tell us, oh, it's so much fun.

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:58.000
Twitter.com slash OLR, getting into some tweets tonight.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.160
We'll start off with a tweet from Rettertainment.

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:05.580
Considering all the AAA games coming out in the next couple of weeks, I'm wondering if

02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:08.680
there's a bank with good rates on credit cards.

02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:10.640
No, there is not.

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:13.440
The answer to your question is no.

02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:17.060
I guess my real answer, even though I get the tongue-in-cheekness of your question,

02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:19.660
the real answer would be, it depends on your credit score.

02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:22.240
The all-important credit score is what's going to determine who's going to give you good

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.240
rates.

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:25.760
Because if your credit score is really bad, then the only way you're going to get a credit

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:31.200
card is what's called a secured credit card, where you pay them $300 to give you a $300

02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:35.320
line of credit, and only when you've really established that you can pay bills on time

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.880
will they give you that $300 back or offer you a card that's not secured.

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:44.400
Or that you have something that's already attached to your bank account.

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.360
So alright, we're going to go to the phones and take some calls.

02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:47.680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:48.680
Who's this?

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:49.680
Hey, this is X-Link.

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:50.680
Hey, X-Link!

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:51.680
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:56.840
Hey, I just wanted to say, Modern Warfare 3 was pretty decent.

02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:01.320
Actually, I'm not really all into first-person shooters, but I actually loved playing it.

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:04.680
I was playing with a roommate of mine, and we loved playing the co-op.

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:06.240
It was a lot of fun.

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:07.240
What do you do in the game?

02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.360
Do you always go through and shoot terrorists in the face?

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:13.200
Yeah, well, there's a co-op called...

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:17.600
It's like a mission-type mode, where they give you different little missions to go through.

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:19.560
And one of the favorite ones we were doing was...

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:21.280
I can't think of the name of it right off the bat.

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.960
I think it's the fifth or sixth one down, in the third or fourth mission, in the second

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:28.440
tier set of missions.

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:35.720
And basically, because I was the second player and my roommate was the first, and she was

02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:42.960
the first player, you would actually try to get him off the base, but you're controlling

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:45.720
the turrets that we're hacking into.

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:49.640
So one person will play as the hacked turret, and basically you can sit there and mow down

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.160
all the enemies as you're trying to get him to run through to the other side of the base.

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.640
It was pretty decent.

02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:56.640
Excellent.

02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.960
I'm actually really interested to hear that you're into this game, because I know you

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.400
and I usually play a lot of the same types of games.

02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:05.080
We both play WoW an awful lot, in fact, way more than we probably should.

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:10.040
We play a lot of the same type of puzzly games on Steam and so forth, but you are actually

02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:11.440
kind of jumping into Modern Warfare.

02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:16.160
Now, I, for one, am terrible at first-person shooters, so how hard is a game like Modern

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:18.520
Warfare for someone like me?

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:22.560
Personally, I suck at first-person shooters myself.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.480
I'm usually the one that's running into room full of 15 enemies and trying to mow them

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.480
all down one time.

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.960
I'm basically the copycat of the noob from the commercial, basically, I'm just like running

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.560
around and doing anything I pretty much could see, I don't really take my time lying behind

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:39.160
walls and stuff.

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:43.560
I guess I'm really bad at that, because I'm so used to, I guess, Grand Theft Auto on the

02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:44.560
end.

02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:45.560
Or Quake.

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:46.560
That's how you play Quake.

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:52.120
That will always be my favorite first-person shooter, is Quake, because there was no such

02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.120
thing as cover.

02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:58.600
Then again, like I said before, I take you back to Quake and stuff like that, and back

02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:03.240
to my days, like of course being a rogue, just going around and pretty much popping

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:08.000
up behind people and killing them.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.760
I liked it, personally.

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.840
I thought it was a lot of fun, the graphics were very cool to look at, it was very updated.

02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.440
The only thing that I got a problem with any of these games now is, they're always talking

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:23.800
about making the next one, it's like how they're going to one-up what you did, seriously.

02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:28.920
I remember playing games and getting used to, say for example, Mario, going from Mario

02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:34.320
World to Mario 64 and seeing the graphics change, and seeing the process of evolution

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:39.520
constantly going through, it's like, what's going to be, how far is it going to be from

02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:44.360
now on before they hit that brick wall, so to speak, before they can't go any further

02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.360
than they do?

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:48.920
We've been saying that ever since the Atari 2600.

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:51.160
How are they going to make these games even more realistic?

02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:53.840
And you know, we've always joked on Orange Launch Radio, everything is getting one step

02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:55.000
closer to the holodeck.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.360
Look, we now have games in 3D!

02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:01.360
I mean, it's, the holodeck will be here in 20 years, baby!

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:02.360
Get ready for it!

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:03.360
You already have holograms!

02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:06.360
Besides, it's about being a wheelchair to holodeck, I don't want to be so old in the

02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:09.360
beginning, you're hardly new, but they'll be kind of interesting to see on the last

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:10.360
day or so.

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:13.040
Hey, if I can get in the holodeck in my wheelchair, I'm there!

02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:17.680
Well, Keith, the reason too is, because I know this is going to take a lot of people

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:22.200
a shot, and I know because last week I called into Bobby's show and I was talking about

02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:27.960
Skyrim, and unfortunately because of the situation which you and Jamie are familiar with with

02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:30.880
my roommate, and I'm going to read all that on the show.

02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:31.880
Personal drama.

02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:33.880
We'll just say personal drama.

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:40.920
Well, long story short, I got fucked over $1500 from my ex-roommate, bottom line.

02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:44.860
And that caused a lot of problems for me getting in, and unfortunately I was really looking

02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:49.840
forward to Skyrim, I had it pre-ordered, I had a lot of money down on it, and unfortunately

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:52.520
I just can't go to the last minute because of other priorities.

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:57.760
So because of that, instead I went to Redbox, tried running like I could, unfortunately

02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.240
I still wanted to play something a little more new, and of course Skyrim, I forgot I

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.520
was being stupid, I go there on a Thursday, I'm like, okay, I'm going to go get Skyrim,

02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:11.220
not thinking that it came out the following day, and because of that I decided to get

02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:16.160
Modern Warfare 3, Modern Warfare 3 was the closest one around the corner, so I got that

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:17.160
instead.

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:21.840
Which was a little disappointed by anyone, because I was very blown away by it.

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.760
Well you'll get to play Skyrim eventually, and you know, personal life stuff's more important,

02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:30.600
and unfortunately that whole situation's kind of crappy, but you'll get through it.

02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:35.600
So yeah, I will, and you know, I was very patient, I was the same way with Fallout,

02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:42.760
and though I really was kind of pissed at, when I did buy it, it was like two weeks later

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:48.400
ago, they now sold Game of the Year edition, but then it was, they had all the DLC out,

02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:49.400
so.

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:54.800
Yeah, I didn't play Fallout until I got that Game of the Year edition, like, used, so,

02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:56.360
you know, it was a long time.

02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:59.440
Alright, well X-Link, we ought to let you go, buddy, to get more calls.

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:03.560
But thanks so much for calling in and telling us about Modern Warfare, take care, buddy.

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:04.560
Oh, anytime.

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.560
Anytime.

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:06.560
Anytime.

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:07.560
Bye bye.

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:08.560
Later.

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:11.960
1877 Game OLR, or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:18.440
He made Modern Warfare sound, basically it's pretty, you're oogling the prettiness, and

02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:21.320
then you shoot bad guys in the face.

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:27.900
Going to more tweets, twitter.com slash orange lounge, or excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR.

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:29.600
We have a couple links from Tiger Claw.

02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:34.280
Oh yeah, the trailer, he linked us to the trailer for the Phoenix Wright live action

02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:35.280
movie.

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:36.280
Did you guys see this?

02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:41.240
There's actually a trailer out there on the interwebs for the, it's pretty cool, yeah,

02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:42.240
it's hilarious.

02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.680
Yeah, I think I saw some of this.

02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:51.400
I will totally watch this, and they've even got the guy's hairs, alright.

02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:59.320
My favorite is, it's totally accurate.

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:04.480
I love that they have the style from the games.

02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:08.080
I will totally watch it, that's going to be like 20 kinds of awesome.

02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:11.200
Oh, she's even wearing the thingy.

02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:13.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:17.240
Hey, it's your one and only local convention whore, DJ Ron Ma S.

02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:20.600
Hey Ron Ma, what convention did you go to this time?

02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:23.280
Last weekend I found myself in the midwest at Yomacon.

02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:24.280
In the midwest?

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:25.280
Yes.

02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:28.280
You poor thing, how'd you end up there?

02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:32.960
Um, friends out there, and a girlfriend, what can I say?

02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:35.840
Oh, I see, you did it for pussy, it's alright.

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:36.840
Alright.

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:37.840
Oh!

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:38.840
Wait!

02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:39.840
Rob, let me ask you something.

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:45.600
What have you done for ass, okay?

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:48.200
Okay?

02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:49.200
No comment, alright.

02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:50.200
Alright then!

02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:53.280
You're just as bad as a whore as me, okay?

02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:56.840
Hey, wait, no, no, no, I'm settled down now.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:58.760
Those days are long behind me.

02:23:58.760 --> 02:23:59.760
Same here.

02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:03.840
Alright, so anyhow, how was the con that you went to?

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:04.840
It was fun.

02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:09.400
I mean, the best part is, is you look across the waterfront, you see Canada.

02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:10.400
Nice.

02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:15.360
You're like, oh, better places, alright.

02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:19.640
I didn't call to talk about the con, but there are two things I want to discuss, so I'll

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:21.200
be on my merry little way.

02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:22.200
Okay.

02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.520
Number one, that story about Skyrim you read earlier?

02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:26.520
Yeah.

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:27.520
I don't recall bullshit.

02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:31.080
Oh, the 13-year-old getting the game at midnight and so forth?

02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:35.240
If that was me, my mother would have tanned my hide and I'd be hanging from a tree right

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:36.240
now.

02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:41.180
But it's different from when you and I were growing up, Rama, the same way.

02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:44.040
My mother, oh my god, she would have lost her shit.

02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:47.520
She would have lost her shit, although she had me, she had such fear instilled in me

02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:51.100
that she had me convinced that there were like rabid dogs waiting outside to chew my

02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.680
face off if I ever tried to sneak out of the house.

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:56.720
I mean, you know, she slept with one eye open.

02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:57.720
True.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:03.040
But on the same token though, I mean, being in the schools for about a year, I don't really

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:08.560
see these 12 and 13-year-olds being at a GameStop or at a Best Buy at midnight by themselves.

02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:12.680
If they're with friends picking up the game, that's believable.

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:17.520
But by yourself on a bike, I don't see that.

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:20.880
I'm going to go ask Dan how many 13-year-olds showed up at his midnight releases.

02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.880
I'll be right back.

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:25.840
Dark Soccer's for an M-rated game.

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:28.880
All right, you know, what was the other thing you wanted to mention?

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:34.080
I wanted to pick at Loki for a comment he said last week.

02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:35.080
Okay.

02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.240
Loki has to pay for something he said last week.

02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:38.240
What's that?

02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:40.200
His comment about Skylanders.

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.200
Okay.

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:47.560
I mean, I understand where he's coming from about how silly the game is, how kids want

02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:50.880
their parents to get that game.

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:52.960
Don't divulge too much information.

02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.240
I understand where he's coming from with that, but on the same token, we were young.

02:25:58.240 --> 02:25:59.240
We were kids.

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:02.600
We did the same thing to our parents, so I don't, I mean, he's going to be doing the

02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:06.720
same thing in a few years when his son wants a silly game like that, and he's going to

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:09.380
be like, here you go, son.

02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:15.640
So I asked Dan how many 13-year-olds he saw at midnight releases for M-rated games, and

02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:18.080
the reply was, a few.

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.080
Okay.

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:20.080
Wow.

02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:21.080
Okay.

02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:22.080
With their parents or no?

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:25.040
Do we find that out, do you think, without?

02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:28.100
And no, I won't be doing that for my son, because I'm not going to buy him stupid shit

02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:30.360
like that.

02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:32.080
All the games have to pass the dad test.

02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:33.080
Hell no.

02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.040
He won't be playing crappy games like Skylanders, please.

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.400
But I mean, if he plays the demo and he likes it, I mean, if that's what he wants for Christmas-

02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.940
How's he going to play a demo for a game that requires some stupid portal of power for some

02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:47.940
crappy-

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:48.940
Then he's grounded.

02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:54.520
Say for example, because my girlfriend's kid, he wants it, so she's getting it for him.

02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:59.440
I have to hear what Loki had to say about it, I was like, well, if that's what he wants,

02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:00.440
that's what he wants.

02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:04.360
He'll learn better if it's a good game or not.

02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:09.240
I have no problem if he wants to play, you know, like a Connectamals or something like

02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:10.240
that.

02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.540
That's a regular game, may not be something that I'm necessarily looking for.

02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:23.400
But a game that promotes the whoring out of children to buy, you know, crappy toys, which

02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:26.600
by the way, they keep putting out more toys, because they're going to just add patches

02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:30.180
to the game so that more toys are compatible with it.

02:27:30.180 --> 02:27:36.640
And so yeah, it's basically just getting kids to beg their parents to buy them toys.

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:37.720
And you know what?

02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:40.800
Parents are dumb enough to buy them their toys, and Activision deserves the money that

02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:42.120
they're getting from them.

02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:47.200
But I'm smart enough to go, no, it's a toy that doesn't do anything, how about I buy

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:48.640
you a cooler toy instead?

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:50.200
And he'll be like, okay.

02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.760
You know what my rule is?

02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:53.880
No TV until you're five.

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:54.880
I'm serious.

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.200
I'm dead serious.

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:58.720
Try having a kid, that's not gonna happen.

02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:02.920
I know plenty of parents who have been completely successful with not having their kids.

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.920
You're gonna run out of things to do with them.

02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:06.920
That's okay.

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:11.520
I would rather them not have, you know, be psychologically dependent on TV.

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:13.840
They're not dependent on it, but sometimes TV helps.

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.520
And I don't want to be, I don't care.

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.520
Anyway.

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:18.520
That doesn't matter to me.

02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:19.520
None of that matters to me.

02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:21.560
Let me get back to the caller.

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:28.600
So Rama, you're giving into the Skylanders stuff for the sake of this kid who just wants

02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:29.600
it.

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:31.560
So Rama, did you buy one of the Tony Hawk ride boards?

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:35.920
Because it was a cool little peripheral that they had for Tony Hawk, and then you like

02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:39.040
supporting Activision, so did you buy one of those?

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:41.040
Does it look like I have $80?

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.080
Oh, well, then why should we be supporting this kind of bullshit?

02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:51.280
Well, then again, it's not my money, but like I said, if he really wanted it, I'm gonna

02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:55.480
be like, fine, you can have this, but I'd be damned if you're getting the rest of them.

02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:59.080
If you want the rest of them, you could miss your friends to get different ones that you

02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:00.360
guys trade off.

02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:03.200
But daddy, I want a golden goose now!

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:08.640
But daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs now!

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:13.320
If you start talking that type of attitude, I will take my belt off right there in Toys

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.320
R Us.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:16.200
Oh, and I will go to town on him.

02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:17.760
You best believe that.

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:22.620
He can have the game when it gets into the bargain bin like March, because that's pretty

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.520
much when it's gonna die out.

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:25.520
Alright.

02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:31.640
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thank you for the lively discussion.

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:37.040
And one thing, Loki, I want you to know, I've taken notes on some of this, so I know what

02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:38.760
to look forward to when my time comes.

02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:40.720
Oh no, he's taken notes!

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:41.720
I'm shaaaaken!

02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:46.360
No, I mean it in a good way, dude.

02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:49.840
He means, he means, I think he means for when he has his bebe.

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:50.840
Yes.

02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:51.840
Alright.

02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:53.440
Alright, have a good one, Rama.

02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:54.440
You too.

02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:55.440
Later.

02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:59.160
See, Loki took that to mean, like, taking notes, like, I'm writing down everything you

02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:02.160
say.

02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:06.640
Tigerclaw sends us another tweet, uh, 1-877-GAMEL-LR, username on skype is orange-sawns-radio if

02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:07.640
you wanna call us.

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:12.960
Uh, Tigerclaw sends us another tweet, apparently, uh, Battlefield Ban Hammer going out left

02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:13.960
and right.

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:21.560
EA has, I guess, doled out hundreds of bannings in Battlefield 3 and they say they will hand

02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:22.760
out more.

02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:28.200
If they wanna boost XP and so forth, they're gonna ban more and more and more.

02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:32.380
Um, they've said on Twitter, we banned hundreds of hackers this week alone and we're determined

02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:35.200
to punish the players who play without integrity.

02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:37.600
Well, hold on, hold on.

02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:38.600
Alright.

02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:39.600
Hackers.

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:41.000
They're calling them hackers.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:47.200
They used the glitch that was in the game because Battlefield 3 wasn't properly tested.

02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:50.200
So perhaps a better term would have been the exploiters.

02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.180
Sure, whatever.

02:30:52.180 --> 02:30:53.400
It's a part of the game.

02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:58.640
If it's a glitch that you leave in your game, then you should not be punishing these guys.

02:30:58.640 --> 02:30:59.640
Here's the rest of a comment.

02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:03.180
A patch is just around the corner and we will continue to ban cheaters.

02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:04.440
We take it seriously.

02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:06.480
That is our attitude here at Battlefield.

02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:11.320
We have zero tolerance for cheating players and are banning more all of the time.

02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:12.320
Let's go to the phones.

02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:13.320
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:14.320
Who's this?

02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.320
Hello.

02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:16.320
This is Amiga777.

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:17.320
Hello, Amiga777.

02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:18.320
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:30.120
Well, um, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about the PSN hacks, the Xbox Live

02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:32.000
hacks, and all that type of stuff.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.080
Yep, hackers gonna hack.

02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:43.880
So I guess one other thing to add to that is I guess that's recently some Facebook hackings.

02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:45.960
Facebook hackings going on.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.960
What's going on on Facebook?

02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:59.040
Well, um, about, what's that, today, um, I found out about some, uh, thing that was going

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:00.040
on.

02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:10.080
There was a, uh, a link from someone in chat and, uh, I guess it was something about, you

02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:17.480
know, like a gross video that nobody has ever really gone past it for 15 seconds.

02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:20.200
Oh, I've kind of, I've kind of seen similar things before.

02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:23.400
Like it says like, uh, like I got a Twitter spam like this one.

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:27.520
Somebody tweeted me and it said, Oh my God, they're talking shit about you on this blog.

02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:28.580
Click here to read it.

02:32:28.580 --> 02:32:32.860
And I, of course I had that skeptical side eye look at it, but it sounds like, like Facebook's

02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:34.360
getting something of the equivalent of that.

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:36.640
Like you watch this video.

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:37.640
It's really gross.

02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:39.160
It'll usually be something like in the UK.

02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:42.680
I had one of those one time that click, it was like, here's a video of something blah,

02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:43.680
blah, blah.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:44.680
And you click on it.

02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:49.440
And then I realized immediately what it was and I saw that it posted something to my board.

02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:53.240
So I blocked it and then I deleted the post and that was it.

02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:57.700
But some people, not everybody's so fast on the, yeah, because if, if you, it posts it

02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:01.160
to yours and then your friend will see that and they'll, they'll post it and then so on

02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:02.160
so forth.

02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:03.160
So what happened to me?

02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:05.200
Go, did you, did you accidentally fall for this?

02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:14.160
Unfortunately, yes, I, you know, probably these instructions is like a three of them.

02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:20.240
Um, not really knowing exactly what was in store, you know, putting this, uh, here's

02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:21.240
my question.

02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:24.600
What, what, what were they advertising in the video that made you want to click it?

02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:28.480
Was it like, see big boobies now click on this link?

02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:36.360
I said it was this really, uh, like nasty video that they were saying, um, it had like

02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:44.480
this image of the back of this person's neck with this really large, you know, nasty zit

02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:46.680
on the back or something like that.

02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:47.680
Gross.

02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:51.120
So yeah, you just, oh, you just, you're, you're into like gross stuff.

02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:58.240
Mine was a celebrity sex tape, so of course, you know, just tried to check it out and then,

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:03.400
uh, you know, and then that, and then it asked me to do this little survey thing and I was

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:08.960
like, I don't want to do a survey and I didn't sign out of that.

02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:11.400
I want to see the gross things on people's necks.

02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.600
I don't want to see a survey.

02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:14.600
I want the boobies.

02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:15.600
I have Shermie.

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.480
I already see gross, gross shit, literally.

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:24.040
So moral of the story, watch what you click on on Facebook because some of that stuff

02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:26.680
is like apps and who knows what.

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:27.680
Yeah.

02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:28.680
Right.

02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:34.320
And then the kicker after that, um, was it like a few seconds later, a few of my friends

02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:40.560
from Ted is like, um, why are you linking me with this, um, you know, a testament?

02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:47.520
I just found out that, you know, um, this, uh, this thing after I, I just did whatever

02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:54.000
it told me it ended up, uh, spreading the, uh, attachment, uh, message across all my

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000
other friends.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.000
And so I hated that.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:06.240
And so I ended up just saying, you know what, again, I'm just gonna, uh, close up my Facebook

02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:11.760
account and whatnot and, uh, change my password and that type of stuff.

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:12.760
That's probably for the best.

02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:16.480
If you get hacked like that, you definitely want to close it up and delete all the crap

02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:19.160
and, uh, change your password as soon as you can.

02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:22.000
So some good tips for the listeners of Orange Lawns Radio.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.800
Be careful what you click on.

02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:25.800
So all right.

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:27.800
Stick, stick to the port site, you know?

02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:28.800
Okay.

02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:29.800
All right.

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:30.800
Amiga77, we're gonna let you go buddy so we can get another call.

02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:31.800
Take care.

02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:32.800
Okay.

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:33.800
All right.

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:34.800
Bye.

02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.160
Be careful what you click on and see Microsoft would have you believe that that's how your

02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:39.080
Xbox is getting hacked, but we'll see.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:40.080
All right.

02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:41.080
We got another call on the line.

02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:42.080
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:43.080
Who's this?

02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:44.080
Hello?

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:45.080
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:46.080
Who's this?

02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:47.480
Hey, wait a minute.

02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:48.920
I got a lag going on here.

02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:49.920
One second.

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:50.920
Okay.

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:51.920
We'll wait.

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.920
It's cool.

02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:53.920
Yeah.

02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:54.920
Sorry about that.

02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:55.920
I had the show running while I was waiting for you to pick up.

02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:56.920
All right.

02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:57.920
Okay.

02:35:57.920 --> 02:35:58.920
Who's this?

02:35:58.920 --> 02:35:59.920
This is, uh, Kaijuto.

02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:00.920
Hey, Kaijuto.

02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:01.920
What's on your mind?

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:02.920
Not much.

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:03.920
I'm just calling to cover a few things.

02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:04.920
First off, I want to say thanks for my prize.

02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:05.920
I finally got it.

02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.600
I know we were kind of late in sending it, but yeah, we got it.

02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:09.600
Don't even worry about that.

02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:10.600
I was just calling to say thanks.

02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.720
I mean, I wasn't gonna rub it in or say, you know, you took forever or anything like that.

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:19.640
We took until we finally got another eBay shipment out where we, we just sent it along

02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:20.720
with the eBay stuff.

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:23.960
So yeah, you can kind of thank Salacious Pop for getting on me with that.

02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:30.640
So are you enjoying your Chinese pirate version of, of, uh, uh, what, what, oh, Child of Eden.

02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:34.840
It's Child of Eden, but not really, it was, um, uh, Assassin's Creed.

02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:37.720
I know, but we bought Child of Eden and that's what we got.

02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:44.040
And the funny thing was, uh, one of you put on the back of it, uh, your mom and let's

02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:47.560
open the package.

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:50.640
Do you remember when, when I got that fake, uh, it was Assassin's Creed.

02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:52.280
No, I didn't hear what he said.

02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:53.280
Oh, he is.

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:56.480
One of you signed it, your mom and my mom opened the package.

02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:00.080
Oh, there you go.

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:01.080
Yeah.

02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:05.480
But, um, uh, another thing I want to get to is, uh, you mentioned earlier, um, I'm not

02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:06.800
an Xbox fan boy.

02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:07.800
I'm just a gamer.

02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:08.800
I love all the systems.

02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:12.520
Uh, you mentioned before that, uh, you couldn't get your, you couldn't remove your credit

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:14.280
card from Xbox live.

02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.280
Yeah.

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:16.280
Uh, you can actually do it.

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:19.320
You just have to call in and have them remove it.

02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:23.040
I just, I, I, I just hate that I have to do that.

02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.480
Like I hate that they're allowed to make it so easy to give it to them and then it's not

02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:28.880
as easy to take it away.

02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:33.160
I mean, I get the business side of it and everything, but just after everything I've

02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:38.600
been through with that company, it's, it's, it's like, I'm almost insulted that they would

02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:42.280
like make me go through that after, you know, getting hacked and all that stuff.

02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:45.880
But you know, yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing is I'll call them and get it

02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:46.880
taken off that way.

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:50.600
But it just, I guess my point is at the end of the day, it just sucks that I have to do

02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:51.600
that.

02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:55.160
Why can't I take it off the account as easy as I was able to put it on the account?

02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:56.160
Yeah.

02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:59.280
The other, the other weird thing about it is if you do want to like remove it, like,

02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:03.960
you know, like, uh, midway through your, um, you know, through your billing cycle, they,

02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.800
uh, they tell you that you'll lose your Xbox live.

02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:11.960
Like you can have the car removed, but you'll lose whatever that amount of weeks or amount

02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:13.640
of days that you have left on goal.

02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:16.060
And my opinion, that's kind of bullshit too.

02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:17.840
Like that's a real problem I have with it.

02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:20.720
So you're not really getting the card off your account.

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.520
You're telling them that you want to cancel and they're going to cancel you because you

02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.020
don't want to keep a credit card on file with them.

02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:30.840
And you already paid for it at the beginning of the year when there's proof that that credit

02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:34.520
card information is being exploited and they just don't want to admit it.

02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:36.120
That pisses me off.

02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:37.120
It's crazy.

02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:38.120
That's what I'm going through now.

02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:41.680
I had to, uh, I spoke with someone and they had to, they all, you also have to call them

02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:44.040
to have the automatic renewal removed.

02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:47.320
So I call to say that I wanted the renewal removed.

02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.480
And when my subscription is up, I want, uh, you know, I want the card removed and then

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:53.940
I'll just pay through whatever that is.

02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:59.280
Now supposedly the automatic renewal is all, you're able to do that on the website because

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:02.440
that was part of the big upgrades they did this week that Jamie was talking about earlier

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:06.400
is that, you know, you can turn that automatic renewal off and I did see that switch.

02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:10.600
So that has changed recently as in like the past week, week and a half.

02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:13.800
But as far as the credit cards go, I went in there and I saw a place where you could

02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:15.920
click remove to remove the credit card.

02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.040
But when I tried to do that, it said, Oh, you can't do that because you're using that

02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:25.120
card to pay for your one month of Xbox live that you used a card for.

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:27.200
Not a credit card, but like a, a over the counter card.

02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.480
I was like, what?

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:34.320
So two other quick things and then I'll let you get to some more calls.

02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:38.560
Um, the, the saints row, when I mentioned, uh, was it a, did they improve from saints

02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:39.560
row too?

02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:44.800
Uh, the thing I was talking about with the camera was I remember in saints row too, um,

02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:49.640
they didn't have a, you know, like a GTA four, you have like three different, uh, I think

02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.640
camera angles you can do.

02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:55.120
You can be like up close, you could be like midway and then like really far back saints

02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:56.120
row too.

02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:57.120
Didn't have any of that.

02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:01.360
It was like your character was always in the way of your, um, your little, uh, your little

02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:02.360
rectical thing.

02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.000
You know what I'm talking about?

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:05.600
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:06.600
Yeah.

02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:07.600
Yeah.

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:08.600
Yeah.

02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:11.760
And that really killed it for me because I couldn't see what I was shooting at and especially

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:12.760
a multiplayer.

02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.340
I know they don't have multiplayer anymore, but it was really hard to, uh, play multiplayer

02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:19.920
when your character is like so blown up in front of you like that.

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:20.920
I had difficulty.

02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:23.640
I never really had that problem, but I mean, I don't know.

02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:30.360
Um, yeah, I don't think they have, uh, any sort of way you can adjust.

02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:33.440
I think your camera, you might be able to adjust your camera distance.

02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:39.920
Um, I'm trying to look here real quick, uh, vehicle camera stamp instant.

02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:40.920
Yeah.

02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:43.960
I don't know if they have a way to adjust the camera.

02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:45.960
Uh, well, here we go.

02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:49.400
Here's, uh, no, I don't see a way to adjust the camera.

02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:56.040
Oh no, there is, I guess the, you know, you can manually adjust it, but, um, yeah, I will

02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:00.360
find it, you know, as really a problem being in the way cause you do have the Amy rectangle

02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:01.360
on the screen.

02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:05.600
So, uh, yeah, you can see where you're shooting at.

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:09.000
And you know, do you remember playing Saints Row 2?

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.520
Like how long ago was it?

02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:12.360
Cause I mean, I haven't played it.

02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:13.360
I got that game.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:14.360
I'm not even kidding.

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:19.000
Um, I got Saints Row 2 the first day it came out and I maybe played it for two weeks and

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.760
I haven't played it since, since the original year that came out.

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:29.040
That the driving in the, in that closeup camera just really screwed the game up for me.

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:32.720
I never really had trouble with the camera at all, I don't remember the driving being

02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:33.720
too bad.

02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:41.560
I mean, um, I played that game to almost 100% and I played Saints Row 1 all the way to 100%.

02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:47.720
Um, I just, and that's including the three DLCs for the second game as well.

02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:50.160
But um, yeah, I don't remember it being a problem.

02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:54.280
I don't know, this one doesn't seem to be a problem so far and I'm about 40% through?

02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:58.440
Yeah, I'm still, yeah, I'm still gonna get three just with everything it has in it.

02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:00.640
But um, just curious about that and that's it.

02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.160
Plus I can only take screenshots in the game, which is pretty awesome.

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.640
You can upload them to the saintsrow.com site.

02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:10.960
I really wish I did that when I saw Professor Genki shooting rockets at pedestrians and

02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:13.680
I was like, whoa, what's that?

02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:14.680
That's different.

02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:17.400
Yeah, and I'm not, I'm not going to miss multiplayer in this one.

02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:21.680
This is like the one game that I'm like, the one game that they removed multiplayer where

02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:26.040
I'm like, I have no problem with that cause that multiplayer, I have to, I hate to admit

02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:27.520
it was, it was terrible for me.

02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:28.520
It could have been better.

02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:29.520
They could have fixed it.

02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:30.520
All right.

02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:31.520
That's it.

02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:32.520
I've been playing Skyrim.

02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.720
It's a great game.

02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:34.720
We all know that.

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:35.720
Yep.

02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:36.840
Anyone who hasn't picked it up, pick it up.

02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:37.840
I'm freaking loving it.

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:38.840
It's a good time.

02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:39.840
And you guys have a nice night.

02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:40.840
All right.

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:41.840
Thanks again for the prize.

02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:42.840
Hey, no problem.

02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.840
Enjoy your bootleg copy.

02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:44.840
All right.

02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.840
Take care.

02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:46.840
Bye.

02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:47.840
All right.

02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:48.840
That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:49.840
Good calls tonight.

02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:50.840
Thanks you guys.

02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:53.600
To those that didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but did you catch the part where we

02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:55.160
said we had no emails this week?

02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:57.760
No, one, we had one that came in right before the show.

02:42:57.760 --> 02:42:59.960
So you should write down your thoughts and we'll read them next week.

02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:05.560
Mailbag at orangeontraday.com or you can tweet us at twitter.com slash O L R. All right.

02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:08.880
In the meantime, I need to finish up just a couple of tweets here that we had, um, dark

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:13.920
Tetsuya tweeted us and said, so the DDR freak thing is still sort of happening in Milpitas

02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:14.920
road trip.

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:15.920
Oh yeah.

02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:16.920
I heard about that.

02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.120
I got a Facebook invite for that today.

02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:22.840
Uh, maybe.

02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:24.440
I don't know.

02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:25.440
It's kind of one of those.

02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:26.440
We have a show.

02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:27.440
I don't know.

02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:28.440
We'll see.

02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:32.240
Um, I'd like to go, but it just might be too last minute for me.

02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.960
I got something else going on next week into, uh, act deaf to last tweet tonight, sequence

02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:39.440
that rhythm RPG game for cheap.

02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:46.800
If enough users subscribe to the page game getter, uh, getter dot G forums.net.

02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:52.800
I guess, uh, I guess if so many people subscribe to this page, you can get the game even cheaper.

02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:53.800
Interesting.

02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:57.400
Interesting way to do it.

02:43:57.400 --> 02:43:58.400
But it's not, Oh yeah.

02:43:58.400 --> 02:43:59.960
No, you get a steam code for it.

02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:02.200
That's pretty cool.

02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:06.680
I see it's a getter dot G dash forums.net.

02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:09.280
It's a look at the tweets to OLR.

02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:13.200
Cause right now the game usually costs five bucks and right now it's down to three bucks

02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:17.480
because 101 people have subscribed, but what are you subscribing to?

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:20.520
I've got to be careful.

02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:22.240
Hopefully you're not subscribing to spam.

02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.240
All right.

02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:24.240
So that does it for tweets tonight.

02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:27.240
Uh, let me go around quickly and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:29.720
I think we'd covered everything, but I'll check with Loki real quick.

02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:30.880
Loki, any last minute stories tonight?

02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:31.880
Oh yeah.

02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:32.880
I was going to talk a few things.

02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:38.120
Um, of course, St. Siro, um, and it just happened.

02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:39.920
These are some of the stories we just didn't talk about.

02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:43.760
Uh, the initiation station had a hundred, 1 million characters upload to it.

02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:44.760
So it's pretty awesome.

02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:45.760
That's one of the cool things about the games.

02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:49.440
You can actually download characters that people make, including, uh, itagaki is one

02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:50.840
of the characters that you can download.

02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:51.840
Nice.

02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:52.840
So that's pretty cool.

02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:58.080
Um, and my character, cause I put it up there so you can search for orange lounge, uh, and

02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:02.640
then of course, uh, the season pass, the first season pass has been announced and this includes

02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.640
the DLC release.

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:06.840
The first three DLCs that are going to be coming out.

02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:12.080
And uh, you know, if you ordered this game off of THQ, uh, their store, you actually

02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:13.080
got it free.

02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:19.880
Um, and in the season pass, we'll save you 15% off of buying the DLC, uh, separately.

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:25.560
And so what it includes is, uh, Genki bowl seven, which is supposed to be coming out

02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:27.080
in January.

02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:31.400
And the description is the wild world of Genki takes over steel port in a sporting tradition.

02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:35.120
Totally under totally and utterly unlike anything else.

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:42.440
Uh, and this is why I was laughing before gangsters in space is the second, uh, DLC

02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:48.760
the coming winter, 2012, the saints go intergalactic in the science fiction misadventure.

02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:52.460
And then the last one is the trouble with clones.

02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:58.320
And that's coming spring at 2012 and says a copycat killing at its finest.

02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:03.440
And also it includes the night blade DLC, which includes, uh, and night blade is one

02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:09.040
of the fictional, like, you know, uh, blade characters in it.

02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:15.840
And um, the night blade mobile, which is a motor or a car, altar boy outfit, bloody,

02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:20.560
uh, Kenanis outfit and the bloody Kenanis bike.

02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:25.880
And those are, um, you know, through the season pass, you'll get that stuff, which I believe

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:28.760
is 20 bucks.

02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:35.600
And then, uh, of course, uh, we talked a little bit about, uh, some cool streaming of, uh,

02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:38.880
game demos on YouTube.

02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:45.040
And of course now there's one for, uh, dead rising to naked stream three year web browser

02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:55.320
using, uh, Gaikai and, uh, I don't believe it's on YouTube, but, uh, let's see here.

02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:04.560
Capcom unity had a link to it and I believe it's actually, uh, yeah, it's on through Gaikai.com.

02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:06.840
So you go there, you can check it out.

02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:08.000
It's a 30 minute demo.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:09.280
That's pretty awesome.

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:10.280
Wow.

02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:14.360
That's a, that's that same site that had the, um, uh, FIFA demo that we talked about a couple

02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:15.360
of weeks ago.

02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:16.360
Yeah.

02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:17.360
Nice.

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.360
Very cool.

02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:19.360
All right.

02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.360
Excuse me.

02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:21.680
Is that it for the stories?

02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:22.680
All right.

02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:25.120
I'm looking at these leaked, uh, leaked costumes.

02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:26.120
Yeah.

02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:27.120
I saw that from hit stun.

02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:31.200
It had posted a link in chat for the, uh, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three download

02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:32.200
costumes.

02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:33.200
Yeah.

02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:34.200
There's like a weapon X Wolverine.

02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:35.200
Nice.

02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:36.200
That's pretty cool.

02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.720
Um, one of a beautiful Joe out of costume.

02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:43.680
I'm so glad now in retrospect that we didn't buy Marvel versus Capcom three now that there's

02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:45.280
the ultimate one that's coming up.

02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:46.960
I bought it, but you know, I'm cool.

02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:48.480
Oh, there's one of what's her face.

02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:53.360
Um, the other chick from devil may cry with the white hair.

02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:54.360
Nice.

02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:55.360
Very cool.

02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:56.360
All right.

02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:57.360
Well that's going to do it for another episode of orange.

02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:58.360
Oh God.

02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:00.600
The worst ever character.

02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:07.080
Oh, um, there's one of iron Patriot who was a character that had during the whole civil

02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:08.680
war thing.

02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:11.840
And then, um, but this is actually pretty cool.

02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:14.640
It's a clone Spidey, the Ben Riley Spidey.

02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:15.640
All right.

02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:16.640
We got to wrap it up.

02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:21.280
We're going to close up shop and, uh, say good night for now until we see you next week.

Definitely more Saints row, dark soccer.

Your final thought tonight.

02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:01.840
One of these other costumes, Rob is rock band.

02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:02.920
Nice.

02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:09.040
And uh, my final thought tonight is, um, so many games coming out that I can't buy them

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:12.840

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:17.880
I need to Disneyland again.
