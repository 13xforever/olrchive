00:14.079 --> 00:26.114
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, November 13th, 2011, DC Universe explodes after going free to play, the way to import UMDs to the PS Vita is revealed, and could the Wii U support multiple tablet controllers after all?

00:31.877 --> 00:36.902
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my friends out there on the Internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.122 --> 00:38.683
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.763 --> 00:46.330
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live tonight, November the 13th of 2011, with the 435th episode of our show.

00:46.891 --> 00:52.376
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live, of course, at All Games Radio, as we are every Sunday night, www.allgames.com.

00:52.556 --> 00:57.341
[SPEAKER_08]: We tape live Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

00:58.001 --> 01:01.263
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

01:01.323 --> 01:05.086
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:05.286 --> 01:05.506
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

01:05.927 --> 01:06.527
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, Jamie?

01:06.867 --> 01:07.168
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy.

01:07.768 --> 01:08.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy.

01:08.529 --> 01:10.210
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.492
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:12.592 --> 01:15.414
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining us in just a few moments is Techmaster Loki.

01:15.614 --> 01:16.995
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a little late to studio tonight.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.597
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm literally listening to him walk in right this second.

01:20.737 --> 01:21.818
[SPEAKER_15]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

01:21.838 --> 01:24.840
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to hear a little more about that excuse as to why he's running late.

01:24.860 --> 01:25.841
[SPEAKER_08]: He's getting situated right now.

01:25.881 --> 01:26.802
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to him in a minute.

01:26.822 --> 01:27.062
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:27.242 --> 01:28.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row, that's why.

01:28.924 --> 01:29.225
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

01:29.525 --> 01:29.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

01:29.805 --> 01:31.307
[SPEAKER_08]: You stood this show up for Saints Row?

01:31.928 --> 01:32.689
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you surprised?

01:33.209 --> 01:33.790
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no.

01:33.890 --> 01:34.331
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at all.

01:35.717 --> 01:37.278
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, welcome, Tech Master Loki.

01:37.858 --> 01:39.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me introduce chat while you get situated real quick.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.903
[SPEAKER_08]: We are, of course, the show where every gamer has a voice, and we always invite your voices via email.

01:44.243 --> 01:46.264
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, seriously, we need more voices via email.

01:46.304 --> 01:46.704
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it true?

01:46.985 --> 01:47.865
[SPEAKER_08]: No emails tonight?

01:48.306 --> 01:51.508
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody's too busy playing Skyrim and Modern Warfare and all that stuff.

01:51.928 --> 01:53.649
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.311
[SPEAKER_08]: The Twitter, of course, Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:56.791 --> 02:00.914
[SPEAKER_08]: And our chat room, our live chat room, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:00.954 --> 02:01.975
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, I forgot to load chat.

02:02.675 --> 02:03.175
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

02:23.388 --> 02:24.069
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me give you this.

02:24.209 --> 02:27.311
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to the mall yesterday and it was a madhouse.

02:27.651 --> 02:28.251
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolute mad.

02:28.271 --> 02:32.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I would have thought yesterday was like the weekend after Thanksgiving.

02:32.595 --> 02:33.435
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that crowded.

02:33.815 --> 02:42.041
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe that's a good sign that the economy is coming back or maybe people just want to get out and get their shopping done before all the craziness hits.

02:42.441 --> 02:42.742
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:43.762 --> 02:46.204
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why I don't go to the mall at all this time of year.

02:47.184 --> 02:49.866
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say I blame you, but that's where my haircut place is.

02:49.906 --> 02:52.587
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to go over there and just there was other errands I wanted to do.

02:52.687 --> 02:53.608
[SPEAKER_08]: So what can you do?

02:54.130 --> 02:56.471
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.472
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's also introduce the chat room.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.793
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get to the Skype calls a little later on.

03:02.253 --> 03:02.913
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me talk about this.

03:02.953 --> 03:08.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of deals, I wanted to start off with a discussion on this real quick, and that is the Black Friday stuff that's starting to hit the Internet.

03:09.095 --> 03:13.597
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't know what Black Friday is, I don't know what hole you've been living in, but maybe you don't live in the U.S.

03:13.637 --> 03:14.217
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be it, too.

03:14.617 --> 03:17.839
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving here in the U.S.

03:18.279 --> 03:23.362
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's usually a day that's kind of the official, unofficial, official kickoff to the holiday shopping season.

03:23.922 --> 03:26.423
[SPEAKER_08]: And things get discounted like crazy.

03:27.124 --> 03:31.646
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the Black Friday ads are starting to leak out there on the Internet.

03:31.666 --> 03:35.968
[SPEAKER_08]: And you kind of have to take a lot of what you read on the Internet with a grain of salt.

03:36.469 --> 03:42.892
[SPEAKER_08]: But a website that's very respected and reputable within the gaming community, CheapAssGamer, at CheapAssGamer.com,

03:43.152 --> 03:43.793
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:03.126 --> 04:32.764
[SPEAKER_08]: The 4 gig console That's very inexpensive Considering that guy is usually about $199 That's a very deep discount Playstation 3 Seems to be $199 most places Probably the cheapest place is Walmart By a whole two cents But Best Buy and Radio Shack are deeply discounting that as well The Wii is down to $100 3DS going down to $179.99 That's a bundle Pack going on there I was going to say because that's not a discount at all Right but it's a bundle pack with a game

04:33.984 --> 04:54.631
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see, discounts on games Current games, Batman Arkham City, gonna be $28 at Walmart, $29 at Best Buy Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, it's still $60 but you can get a $10 gift card at Target Gears of War 3 for $28 at Walmart Need for Speed, The Run, $30 at Best Buy

04:55.791 --> 04:57.552
[SPEAKER_08]: Some pretty good deals throughout there.

04:58.393 --> 05:01.976
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, that list I was reading from is just cheapassgamer.com.

05:01.996 --> 05:04.118
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a little compilation going on there.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.860
[SPEAKER_08]: That's their specialty is looking at game deals.

05:08.581 --> 05:12.905
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to kind of ask the folks in the studio here, do you get excited about Black Friday?

05:12.965 --> 05:15.487
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something you think you might participate in for some of these deals?

05:15.507 --> 05:18.089
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you like, hell no, get me the hell away from those stores?

05:18.509 --> 05:18.949
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

05:19.470 --> 05:19.610
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

05:19.890 --> 05:21.211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have anything I don't already want.

05:21.231 --> 05:22.352
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

05:22.552 --> 05:24.033
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want something, you just go get it.

05:24.334 --> 05:28.758
[SPEAKER_06]: Having gone out to stores on Black Friday before, no, I'll be staying inside and playing Saints Row.

05:29.078 --> 05:32.621
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really, I can get just as good deals online.

05:34.223 --> 05:36.665
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I know people who are going.

05:37.126 --> 05:37.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

05:37.586 --> 05:41.329
[SPEAKER_15]: So if they're going to be there anyway, I just say, okay, you do this for me.

05:41.650 --> 05:42.911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about Cyber Monday.

05:42.971 --> 05:44.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyber Monday, I don't have to go anywhere.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.234
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sit down and deals come to me.

05:46.414 --> 05:46.874
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

05:47.275 --> 05:48.896
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little more into the Cyber Monday.

05:49.136 --> 05:53.099
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never gone out on Black Friday, but some of these deals, I don't know, they have me thinking.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.119
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some good game prices.

05:54.139 --> 05:56.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know who doesn't like Steam?

05:56.721 --> 05:57.402
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to Steam.

05:57.422 --> 05:58.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to say Cyber Monday.

05:59.183 --> 06:00.524
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big Steam thing right there.

06:01.124 --> 06:01.525
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.487
[SPEAKER_08]: Hat day is going to hurt on Steam, that's for sure.

06:05.748 --> 06:06.008
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

06:06.308 --> 06:13.213
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really, the only things that I could possibly want slash need is I'd like a new laptop.

06:13.693 --> 06:14.274
[SPEAKER_15]: That's about it.

06:15.154 --> 06:17.735
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like for my current computer to not be a piece of shit.

06:18.355 --> 06:21.756
[SPEAKER_15]: Which it won't be once I put Windows 7 and Linux Mint on it.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.496
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that's coming soon.

06:25.077 --> 06:28.458
[SPEAKER_08]: You told me the other day you were still running Vista and I was like, oh, poor thing.

06:28.478 --> 06:30.098
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've had problems going on.

06:30.518 --> 06:35.319
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, right now, honestly, given my situation, I'm just lucky to have a roof over my head.

06:36.140 --> 06:37.400
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to have food to eat.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.661
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to have stuff to wear.

06:41.302 --> 06:43.769
[SPEAKER_08]: So quite honestly... You're being very zen about the whole thing.

06:43.789 --> 06:47.500
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just very like, you know, I don't need material possessions anymore.

06:48.504 --> 06:50.705
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's not really so much of a that.

06:51.005 --> 06:58.747
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that having been slapped in the face with the possibility of maybe being homeless or having nothing to eat.

06:58.987 --> 07:00.308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to be homeless.

07:00.348 --> 07:07.150
[SPEAKER_15]: But it sort of realigned my values, I guess, my perspective.

07:07.390 --> 07:07.870
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotcha.

07:08.290 --> 07:16.573
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to really dread turning 30, but then when I was really sick in 2008, which you guys might remember, I was like, hey, turning 30 is awesome because I actually lived to be 30.

07:17.709 --> 07:19.770
[SPEAKER_15]: Life is actually better once you're 30, too.

07:20.270 --> 07:20.810
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

07:20.910 --> 07:22.511
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, that's for another.

07:22.991 --> 07:25.272
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for the Zen show, which will be our third podcast.

07:25.332 --> 07:32.914
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, seriously, it's just sort of like, you know, if I want these games, I can rent them if I really want to play it.

07:33.594 --> 07:37.536
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've got tons of games that I've, you know, hardly played.

07:37.656 --> 07:43.958
[SPEAKER_15]: I just started Project Diva, which is fun.

07:44.358 --> 07:46.179
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll get into that in a minute during Gaming Weeks.

07:46.199 --> 07:49.321
[SPEAKER_08]: But let me go to some of the comments from our chat room at chat.orangelantradio.com.

07:49.841 --> 07:53.143
[SPEAKER_08]: HitStun says, I get roughly half my Christmas shopping done on Black Friday.

07:53.783 --> 07:55.944
[SPEAKER_08]: SalaciousPop says, fuck the mall, seriously.

07:56.444 --> 07:57.405
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Fry's.

07:57.485 --> 07:59.406
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only in-real-life store I'd go to.

07:59.666 --> 08:00.867
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the worst.

08:01.087 --> 08:02.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not go to Fry's on Black Friday.

08:03.428 --> 08:11.812
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go to Fry's and watch the guy walking around with a balloon that says, line ends here, and then you watch it snake through the entire store.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did that one time because I think I was actually living with you at the time.

08:15.754 --> 08:16.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think you were.

08:16.254 --> 08:20.116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was buying a replacement motherboard or something because my computer had died.

08:21.477 --> 08:25.341
[SPEAKER_06]: and that line took like an hour and a half to go through not again

08:45.799 --> 08:50.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Actdeft says, I got my Dreamcast for $50 on a Black Friday sale.

08:50.503 --> 08:51.123
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.

08:51.624 --> 08:54.827
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru says, I got my 360 on a Black Friday a few years back.

08:55.607 --> 08:58.210
[SPEAKER_08]: Eric K. says, I Black Friday on Amazon.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.192
[SPEAKER_08]: And Amiga777 says, what's a fries?

09:01.693 --> 09:02.834
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, they don't have them everywhere.

09:03.359 --> 09:06.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Think like a Best Buy that's like three times as big.

09:06.622 --> 09:07.843
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what a Fry's is.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.286
[SPEAKER_08]: It sells, you know, a lot of electronic and appliances and all that.

09:11.306 --> 09:12.547
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty much what a Fry's is, right?

09:13.187 --> 09:14.509
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of good deals.

09:14.689 --> 09:16.951
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell a lot more components than a Best Buy does.

09:16.971 --> 09:18.492
[SPEAKER_15]: And really crappy toys that you don't need.

09:20.453 --> 09:22.354
[SPEAKER_08]: and food, like nerd food.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.814
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the other weird thing.

09:23.894 --> 09:25.135
[SPEAKER_15]: Astronaut ice cream!

09:25.175 --> 09:26.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Buy does kind of have that though.

09:26.755 --> 09:29.216
[SPEAKER_08]: They have like the movie food at their counter, so whatever.

09:29.356 --> 09:29.596
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

09:30.116 --> 09:31.716
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's comments from our chat room.

09:31.736 --> 09:46.041
[SPEAKER_06]: The fries, not only can you get your games and stuff like that, you can get stuff to outfit a convenience store, including a cotton candy maker, a hot dog cooker, and all sorts of things.

09:46.061 --> 09:47.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just random stuff.

09:47.641 --> 09:50.503
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I've ever bought any of that shit at Fry's, but... I've thought about it.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.845
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get your deep fryer at Fry's?

09:53.365 --> 09:54.446
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was a Christmas gift.

09:54.466 --> 09:56.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right, that's right.

09:56.367 --> 09:58.228
[SPEAKER_06]: I want another one, but the wife won't let me.

09:58.629 --> 10:04.453
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, we're going to go on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

10:04.973 --> 10:05.934
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start off with Dark Sakura.

10:05.954 --> 10:07.034
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you mentioned Project D.Va.

10:07.515 --> 10:13.839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I had started it and then remembered that I had to write a research paper, so I turned it off.

10:13.919 --> 10:15.160
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to actually find the...

10:18.174 --> 10:22.157
[SPEAKER_15]: Charger for our PSP so that I can take it with me to school.

10:23.298 --> 10:24.960
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's cute, very pretty.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.602
[SPEAKER_15]: And I played some WoW.

10:27.802 --> 10:30.904
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm almost level 60 on Gyaru.

10:32.486 --> 10:33.907
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one in the Horde House Guild, right?

10:33.927 --> 10:34.988
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the one in the Horde House Guild.

10:35.148 --> 10:35.588
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

10:35.648 --> 10:37.190
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really enjoying Priest.

10:37.230 --> 10:38.651
[SPEAKER_15]: I never thought I would really like it.

10:38.942 --> 10:39.262
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

10:54.170 --> 10:54.570
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

11:14.062 --> 11:16.204
[SPEAKER_15]: But you need to come back and we need to do Pally Pals.

11:16.584 --> 11:17.925
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we were having fun with it for a while.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.727
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob and I have paladins that look oddly related.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.188
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a paladin named Diabetes.

11:23.188 --> 11:27.471
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine's named Sylviara, but I actually tried to make a decent name.

11:28.892 --> 11:30.533
[SPEAKER_15]: I could have named her Cotton Candy.

11:31.013 --> 11:36.717
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided since they weren't going to give me the walrus people so I could have a walrus named Diabetes, I guess I'll just have a paladin.

11:37.318 --> 11:43.542
[SPEAKER_15]: I made you a Tuskar in the model viewer named Wilford.

11:44.922 --> 11:46.003
[SPEAKER_15]: I made it in honor of you.

11:46.423 --> 11:46.703
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

11:47.163 --> 11:49.664
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm laughing at the salacious pop in our chat room.

11:50.024 --> 11:52.464
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Rob is going to come home with a churro machine now.

11:52.744 --> 11:53.985
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they sell those at Fry's?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.965
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if so, that's on my holiday list.

11:56.005 --> 11:56.886
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.166
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm serious.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.106
[SPEAKER_06]: You go over there.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.288
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the appliance section, at least in our local one over here in Roseville.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.448
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a goddamn churro machine.

12:05.488 --> 12:06.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how popular I'd be?

12:07.228 --> 12:09.269
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be like having Disneyland in my house.

12:09.909 --> 12:11.870
[SPEAKER_15]: I live in the cat bathroom, so I could always have.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.350
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have a slurping machine there.

12:16.007 --> 12:17.147
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have a slurping machine.

12:17.308 --> 12:17.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry.

12:17.668 --> 12:18.788
[SPEAKER_15]: I know what I'm getting you, Rob.

12:19.408 --> 12:19.849
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.169
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more of a gift for Salacious Pop.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you get me a gift for him?

12:24.610 --> 12:25.651
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you'll benefit from it.

12:26.031 --> 12:26.331
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

12:26.891 --> 12:27.292
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

12:27.352 --> 12:29.873
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something where it's like it'll keep him busy so I can do what I want?

12:30.133 --> 12:30.273
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

12:30.593 --> 12:30.833
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

12:31.553 --> 12:31.793
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

12:32.193 --> 12:35.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, back to games you've been playing.

12:35.155 --> 12:35.795
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow and so forth.

12:36.435 --> 12:39.697
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I really haven't had a whole lot of time for games.

12:39.757 --> 12:44.381
[SPEAKER_15]: As I said last week, we had to finish compiling the magazine this week.

12:44.461 --> 12:45.962
[SPEAKER_15]: So most of my time has been spent at school.

12:47.763 --> 12:52.866
[SPEAKER_15]: So I did like a little bit of flash gaming and rearranged my entire portable hard drive.

12:54.788 --> 13:00.752
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was hanging out with the art director while he was finishing the compiling and I had to do last minute corrections and stuff.

13:01.612 --> 13:24.475
[SPEAKER_15]: that's all done hopefully we go to print I think tomorrow or Tuesday so now that that's done my research paper is ready I'm expecting everyone to buy an issue seriously you'll have my eternal gratitude if you buy an issue of the American River Review and can see all my gorgeous work that's okay I have enough issues already you've got subscriptions what are you talking about

13:26.522 --> 13:27.583
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running low on toilet paper.

13:27.603 --> 13:29.124
[SPEAKER_15]: But Dan finished Arkham City.

13:29.865 --> 13:30.165
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah?

13:30.606 --> 13:31.587
[SPEAKER_15]: He finished all the missions.

13:31.907 --> 13:32.148
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

13:32.708 --> 13:35.011
[SPEAKER_08]: Has he found every Riddler trophy?

13:35.191 --> 13:35.691
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

13:36.152 --> 13:37.934
[SPEAKER_15]: He has found enough to find Riddler.

13:38.474 --> 13:38.815
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

13:39.135 --> 13:42.358
[SPEAKER_15]: So he beat Riddler, which is kind of a letdown.

13:43.039 --> 13:43.339
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.340
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's funny.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.523
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to say Riddler sets off my gaydar.

13:48.226 --> 13:52.630
[SPEAKER_08]: Riddler is kind of, like, this is going to sound really weird, but Riddler's kind of hot.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.972
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it depends on which Riddler we're talking about.

13:55.072 --> 14:03.920
[SPEAKER_08]: But this Riddler is like... Not so much like Frank Gorshin, Riddler from 60s Batman, but I'm talking like when they tried to make Riddler very metrosexual.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.904
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was going to say metro, but he sets off, but he actually does set off my gaydar.

14:08.044 --> 14:08.324
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

14:08.705 --> 14:13.389
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the first time I've ever had a character in a game set off my infallible gaydar.

14:14.116 --> 14:15.598
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the greatest question of all.

14:16.219 --> 14:17.780
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

14:18.301 --> 14:22.646
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Dan did the whole thing with Catwoman when you go back to help Batman.

14:23.207 --> 14:24.729
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, he did the thing where she leaves him.

14:25.914 --> 14:29.297
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that part yet, so you better not be spoiling or I'll come over there and kick your butt.

14:29.317 --> 14:29.897
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just funny.

14:29.957 --> 14:32.119
[SPEAKER_15]: You should do it at least once because you can go back and fix it.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.502
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear story mode is actually not that long, all things considered.

14:36.702 --> 14:41.606
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the primary missions are really not that long, but there's so much else to do.

14:41.626 --> 14:42.807
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Grand Theft Batman.

14:43.587 --> 14:45.589
[SPEAKER_15]: The hush ones are really cool.

14:45.769 --> 14:45.909
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

14:46.109 --> 14:47.330
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

15:04.093 --> 15:05.454
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know why I love Batman?

15:05.554 --> 15:11.176
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not... I'm actually not a big comic reader, although, I don't know, like... I'm sitting here reading a comic right now.

15:11.196 --> 15:20.420
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, funny enough, Salacious Pop bought... We went to a brand new comic book store out in Natomas, like some brand new place that just opened up like a month ago, and he bought The Killing Joke.

15:20.901 --> 15:22.181
[SPEAKER_08]: The Killing Joke is very good.

15:22.461 --> 15:24.622
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was thinking I might steal that and read it.

15:25.062 --> 15:27.383
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't usually... I'm not like a comic book reader.

15:27.403 --> 15:29.985
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that I dislike them, I just... It's a fucked up story.

15:30.145 --> 15:30.665
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, I know.

15:31.385 --> 15:41.910
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why I love Batman so much is not just the movies, which were brilliant, but seriously, growing up, I think I saw every single episode of the old Batman series from the 60s with Adam West.

15:42.230 --> 15:46.132
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not grow up in the 60s, but they re-ran them all the time.

15:46.152 --> 15:47.532
[SPEAKER_15]: But Julie Newmar was my hero.

15:48.052 --> 15:48.553
[SPEAKER_08]: She's great.

15:49.273 --> 15:51.554
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really sad that they don't re-run them now.

15:52.294 --> 15:53.236
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:10.057 --> 16:14.000
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a few characters in there that I know they're Batman characters, but I don't know who they are.

16:14.120 --> 16:18.683
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew Solomon Grundy was a Batman character, but I had no idea who exactly he was.

16:19.484 --> 16:21.205
[SPEAKER_15]: For me, I love the art in the game.

16:21.865 --> 16:25.708
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've just been sitting there watching him because I'm looking at the scenery.

16:26.889 --> 16:32.733
[SPEAKER_15]: And for me, my favorite place is when they go, I don't know if you've been there yet, but the Wonder City underground.

16:33.874 --> 16:34.714
[SPEAKER_08]: The sunken streets.

16:34.814 --> 16:36.796
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in a subway system underground.

16:37.016 --> 16:37.116
Yeah.

16:37.376 --> 16:44.241
[SPEAKER_15]: Under the subway, closer to where Wonder Tower is, you can go underground and it's like this World's Fair exhibition.

16:44.861 --> 16:50.105
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's all these city streets, like little, you know, with buggies and everything, only it's all torn up.

16:50.565 --> 16:52.627
[SPEAKER_15]: But a lot of the artwork in there is very Art Nouveau.

16:53.553 --> 17:00.239
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm up to the, just to give you an idea where I'm at in the story, keep in mind I have done some of the side quests, like some of the Zaz stuff, which that guy's scary.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.962
[SPEAKER_15]: But, okay, was it just me or does his voice sound like a woman at first?

17:04.143 --> 17:06.565
[SPEAKER_08]: He just sounds like he has a problem.

17:06.785 --> 17:07.986
[SPEAKER_08]: He sounded like a woman.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.167
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to give him a hug, but you don't.

17:09.187 --> 17:11.669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll carve your name into my skin.

17:11.749 --> 17:14.031
[SPEAKER_08]: He puts the notion in the basket.

17:14.512 --> 17:17.855
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room is reminding us that they do rerun him on the hub.

17:18.693 --> 17:19.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, The Hub.

17:19.674 --> 17:20.214
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that really?

17:20.354 --> 17:20.574
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

17:20.594 --> 17:22.115
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

17:22.155 --> 17:25.037
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, I was going to say, I am at the point in the game, I'm in the museum.

17:25.998 --> 17:27.439
[SPEAKER_15]: As your hunting penguin.

17:27.819 --> 17:28.320
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of.

17:28.620 --> 17:34.584
[SPEAKER_08]: We just kicked some of his henchman's ass, and then we were at this part with boats, and you're having to use the grappling hook.

17:34.624 --> 17:35.304
[SPEAKER_08]: That's annoying.

17:35.484 --> 17:36.285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

17:36.865 --> 17:37.746
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so frustrated.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.407
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many times I've been eaten by a shark?

17:39.787 --> 17:42.629
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know how many more times you're going to have to do shit like that in the game?

17:43.410 --> 17:43.650
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh.

17:44.811 --> 17:46.111
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait till you get... Otherwise, I love it.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.292
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till you get the cryobomb.

17:48.793 --> 17:49.053
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

17:49.913 --> 17:51.594
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you... Can't wait.

17:51.674 --> 17:52.934
[SPEAKER_14]: You throw it in the water.

17:53.955 --> 17:55.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Or else it gets the hose again.

17:55.235 --> 17:55.875
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, though?

17:55.895 --> 17:57.096
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to know what's really annoying?

17:57.156 --> 17:58.856
[SPEAKER_15]: Is going and trying to do all that shit with Catwoman.

18:00.016 --> 18:01.817
[SPEAKER_15]: But keep in mind, she can climb on the ceiling.

18:01.937 --> 18:03.838
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the Catwoman parts are my favorite so far.

18:03.858 --> 18:04.938
[SPEAKER_08]: I love her whip!

18:05.178 --> 18:06.038
[SPEAKER_08]: Her and Poison Ivy.

18:06.438 --> 18:07.579
[SPEAKER_08]: She's so much fun to battle with.

18:07.919 --> 18:08.719
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.140
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, that's, that's hotness.

18:11.460 --> 18:12.161
[SPEAKER_15]: Or poison, I mean.

18:12.201 --> 18:13.081
[SPEAKER_08]: She is, she is pretty hot.

18:13.282 --> 18:17.744
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I think in the chat room, Tigerclaw asked, hotter than Catwoman, I think in reference to my Riddler reference.

18:18.384 --> 18:23.367
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I mean, it kind of depends on what you're into, but, you know, I'm very secure in my homosexuality when I say this.

18:23.427 --> 18:24.948
[SPEAKER_08]: Catwoman has a nice rack.

18:26.389 --> 18:27.930
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's the, uh, She's hot.

18:28.070 --> 18:29.811
[SPEAKER_15]: the new style Catwoman, too.

18:30.211 --> 18:31.512
[SPEAKER_15]: So she's probably fucking Batman.

18:31.712 --> 18:36.675
[SPEAKER_08]: You just, like, any minute, that, that zipper's just gonna fly open and go, woohoo!

18:36.975 --> 18:37.455
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

18:37.836 --> 18:38.056
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

18:39.278 --> 18:43.380
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, so while I haven't been playing it, I've really been getting into it.

18:44.361 --> 18:50.004
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like I said, for me, it's going around and looking at everything and really taking in the scenery.

18:50.224 --> 18:53.766
[SPEAKER_15]: And Dan will actually just stop and go exploring places for me so I can see it.

18:53.886 --> 18:54.386
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's fun.

18:54.546 --> 18:55.166
[SPEAKER_15]: This is pretty cool.

18:55.426 --> 18:59.869
[SPEAKER_08]: The other night I was playing with a group of friends and they were like, go in the place that says live nude girls.

19:00.109 --> 19:01.489
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a place that says live nude girls.

19:01.529 --> 19:01.910
[SPEAKER_08]: Go in the door.

19:01.930 --> 19:02.410
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two signs.

19:02.450 --> 19:03.090
[SPEAKER_15]: Live nude girls.

19:03.230 --> 19:03.450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

19:04.131 --> 19:04.971
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you can go in there.

19:04.991 --> 19:05.832
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the door was locked.

19:06.552 --> 19:07.993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming maybe it comes into play later.

19:09.413 --> 19:10.754
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it really... Oh, really?

19:10.934 --> 19:13.215
[SPEAKER_08]: I assumed it was a Riddler Room that came up later or something.

19:13.795 --> 19:18.837
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those... Of course, based on our speculation, Riddler Room wouldn't be at Live Noob Girls.

19:19.438 --> 19:20.018
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

19:20.658 --> 19:23.999
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, his little hideout, by the way, is fucking sadistic.

19:24.740 --> 19:25.180
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

19:26.060 --> 19:29.422
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah... Dude, Tigerclaw says, you know you can punch the shark?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.002
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

19:30.022 --> 19:30.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

19:31.553 --> 19:32.694
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna do that next time.

19:32.974 --> 19:34.755
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna tell Dan to go punch the shark.

19:35.035 --> 19:36.476
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna shoot him in the face with the electric gun.

19:36.496 --> 19:38.358
[SPEAKER_15]: You bet you cannot jump it.

19:38.378 --> 19:38.858
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

19:39.719 --> 19:40.759
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to move on, sorry.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.402
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, that's been what my gaming week has been.

19:45.563 --> 19:52.888
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm planning on, now that I've got my research paper done, I've got like one more paper that I've got to do with my group, but we have to pick a piece of art.

19:53.648 --> 19:54.729
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

19:56.397 --> 19:56.757
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

19:56.777 --> 20:01.722
[SPEAKER_15]: Because half the group's into modern movies and stuff.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.682
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, we could do a movie.

20:02.742 --> 20:03.943
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, we're going to do Rocky shit.

20:04.784 --> 20:06.405
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were coming over Tuesday to do the time warp.

20:07.066 --> 20:07.466
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

20:08.127 --> 20:11.830
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when that's all done, I'm going to play the shit out of Project Diva.

20:13.912 --> 20:14.232
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

20:14.612 --> 20:15.133
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell yeah.

20:16.414 --> 20:17.135
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

20:17.635 --> 20:19.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Need I ask, how was your gaming week?

20:20.718 --> 20:21.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Very fulfilling.

20:21.498 --> 20:24.401
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing a lot of things this week, actually.

20:25.886 --> 20:27.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto Modern Warfare

20:45.868 --> 20:46.968
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it doesn't have multiplayer in it.

20:47.548 --> 20:48.529
[SPEAKER_06]: No deathmatch in it.

20:49.029 --> 20:49.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.289
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

20:50.469 --> 20:51.809
[SPEAKER_08]: It has co-op, but not deathmatch?

20:51.869 --> 20:52.049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

20:52.229 --> 20:52.670
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

20:52.690 --> 20:54.330
[SPEAKER_08]: So wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:54.730 --> 20:57.351
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you're all about Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

20:57.451 --> 20:57.951
[SPEAKER_08]: Like three?

20:58.291 --> 20:58.711
[SPEAKER_08]: The new one?

20:59.111 --> 20:59.251
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

20:59.891 --> 20:59.991
[SPEAKER_06]: One.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

21:03.552 --> 21:03.952
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

21:04.592 --> 21:05.672
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that one.

21:05.752 --> 21:06.353
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's cheap.

21:06.793 --> 21:08.073
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to buy five copies.

21:08.733 --> 21:37.316
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, so you're starting with the one you could get for $9.99 these days Exactly, so that's what we're playing And the only reason that they're switching to it is because they got tired of me beating them And I'm happy to report that our first game that we played on it I nearly, well I doubled second place's scores So I'm still going to beat them in this game So I don't know what the point was in switching, but whatever They wanted to mix it up I have an important news flash What?

21:37.356 --> 21:38.037
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan brought me pizza

21:39.508 --> 21:40.468
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he bring me pizza?

21:40.509 --> 21:41.029
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get some.

21:41.089 --> 21:41.649
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

21:41.689 --> 21:42.029
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.111
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other than that, let's see.

21:45.211 --> 21:51.914
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Zelda the Four Swords Adventure on the 3DS or DS, I guess.

21:52.114 --> 21:53.715
[SPEAKER_06]: It's off the store.

21:55.195 --> 21:55.696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

21:56.176 --> 22:01.058
[SPEAKER_06]: I think definitely more of a game for more than one person and not too fun playing it by yourself.

22:01.818 --> 22:04.059
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

22:04.380 --> 22:04.720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.261
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, definitely more fun with more people.

22:08.340 --> 22:11.324
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, yeah, yeah, I played Saints Row the Third, which is just amazing.

22:12.745 --> 22:17.951
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually about 13 hours into it already, and it's just great.

22:18.111 --> 22:23.698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's every bit of awesome that I wanted it to be it is, and then some.

22:24.058 --> 22:26.581
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be something negative, something you're not happy about.

22:28.290 --> 22:33.393
[SPEAKER_06]: The escort missions are still annoying because the AI is still kind of eh.

22:33.533 --> 22:46.839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit glitchy now and then, but not anything that really hurts the game, just like funny stuff like I'll finish a tank mission or something and when I'm done there's corpses stuck in the ground and so you can walk up to them and they kind of like bounce around back and forth and stuff.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same shit that's funny in Skyrim, like mammoths just randomly falling from the sky and all that.

22:51.702 --> 22:51.842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Just random stuff, and that's fine.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.563
[SPEAKER_06]: I expect that game to be slightly buggy, because that's how Saints Row is.

22:58.663 --> 23:00.944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just slightly buggy, and it's fine.

23:01.224 --> 23:02.604
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it more funny.

23:03.744 --> 23:06.105
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, though, the missions are great.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what I've played so far.

23:09.186 --> 23:12.886
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some really good direction to them, and...

23:16.187 --> 23:22.129
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even some that have, like, kind of music that plays along with it that's just really awesome.

23:22.169 --> 23:23.930
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sets the mood so well.

23:24.050 --> 23:27.511
[SPEAKER_08]: How does the game... Like, you know, keep in mind, I haven't played a lot of the Saints Row games.

23:27.551 --> 23:30.392
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the first one for, like, an hour, tops.

23:30.772 --> 23:34.894
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, how does it transition from all these bits of randomness one to another?

23:34.934 --> 23:36.715
[SPEAKER_08]: Because isn't it a very open-world game?

23:37.155 --> 23:42.497
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, when I started seeing all this stuff, like, that there's Tron parodies in it and all these things, I was like, how do they...

23:43.337 --> 23:45.039
[SPEAKER_08]: How do they work that all into the game?

23:45.519 --> 23:47.161
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it go from one parody to another?

23:48.382 --> 23:49.523
[SPEAKER_06]: It works really well, actually.

23:49.864 --> 24:03.017
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the very beginning, the first few missions, actually quite a bit of the missions, I think I was up through 20% of the game and it was still doing tutorial missions, I guess, to kind of introduce you to the different activities that you can do in the game.

24:04.694 --> 24:08.276
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's really strange sometimes.

24:08.316 --> 24:20.200
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, there's one that you're being trained by this one saint that you pick up who's voiced by Hulk Hogan.

24:20.861 --> 24:31.205
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's training you to be able to confront Kilbane, who's this luchador, the leader of the luchador gang or whatever in there and stuff.

24:31.245 --> 24:31.545
[SPEAKER_06]: And so...

24:32.385 --> 24:34.746
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like a little bit of Karate Kid, sort of.

24:35.306 --> 24:41.969
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great because one of the songs in the game is The Best from Karate Kid.

24:42.070 --> 24:46.131
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the best around.

24:46.251 --> 24:46.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

24:47.232 --> 24:51.974
[SPEAKER_06]: And they actually have that in the part when you first talk to the guy and stuff.

24:52.514 --> 24:54.115
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's having you feel pain.

24:54.155 --> 24:57.737
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the missions that you do, it's basically an activity.

24:57.857 --> 25:00.898
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's lots of pop culture references left and right, essentially.

25:00.918 --> 25:00.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

25:01.879 --> 25:04.382
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not all pop culture references.

25:04.442 --> 25:06.444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really over the top.

25:07.805 --> 25:09.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Just very big action sequences.

25:09.667 --> 25:11.549
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people have you slapped in the face with a dildo?

25:12.270 --> 25:12.690
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

25:13.791 --> 25:15.453
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it keeps the stats for that.

25:16.554 --> 25:17.455
[SPEAKER_06]: You lost count.

25:18.456 --> 25:19.036
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

25:19.277 --> 25:21.178
[SPEAKER_06]: This game has... How many whores have you killed?

25:22.339 --> 25:22.780
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.081
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I've killed that many whores.

25:24.101 --> 25:26.503
[SPEAKER_06]: There aren't that many... There's some strange shit, okay?

25:26.623 --> 25:33.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, seriously, you'll be walking around, all of a sudden, you know, there's gimps walking around, and then these furries walking around.

25:33.489 --> 25:34.850
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what the hell is going on?

25:35.350 --> 25:35.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Today...

25:36.511 --> 25:37.832
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is an easter egg.

25:37.852 --> 25:43.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, I ran across, you know, Genki, the cat head guy that's running this Japanese game show or whatever.

25:44.559 --> 25:46.301
[SPEAKER_06]: The mascot for this game, almost.

25:47.121 --> 25:51.526
[SPEAKER_06]: All of a sudden, I see him running around the street shooting people with rocket launchers.

25:51.546 --> 25:51.766
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like,

25:53.251 --> 25:53.891
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing out here?

25:54.472 --> 26:00.617
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I went to go try to kill him, and I did manage to kill him finally, but it took a lot.

26:00.677 --> 26:06.581
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it glitched him underneath a dump truck or something, and that crushed him to death.

26:07.142 --> 26:11.305
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo in our chatroom is asking, Loki, did they fix the camera and the driving in Saints 3?

26:11.385 --> 26:14.988
[SPEAKER_08]: The bad camera and the bad driving killed Saints 2 for me.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that's chat.orange.com.

26:16.509 --> 26:17.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they fixed the driving.

26:17.790 --> 26:18.771
[SPEAKER_06]: The driving is awesome.

26:19.131 --> 26:22.113
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:44.224 --> 26:46.585
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just a horde mode.

26:46.665 --> 26:48.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Some waves have whores in them.

26:48.806 --> 26:51.366
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them, you're shrunken down really small.

26:51.446 --> 26:52.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them, you're really big.

26:53.287 --> 26:54.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Just ridiculous stuff.

26:56.028 --> 26:58.309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think of some really strange stuff.

26:58.449 --> 27:03.570
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I have a gun now that I can fire at a car that allows me to control it like an RC car, which is kind of fun.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.031
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like Driver.

27:07.012 --> 27:10.693
[SPEAKER_06]: You have parachutes that you can use whenever, so you can just skydive off a building and...

27:12.774 --> 27:14.534
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have wingsuits.

27:15.295 --> 27:16.995
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have any wingsuits, unfortunately.

27:17.055 --> 27:17.776
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you having a lot of fun?

27:18.216 --> 27:20.317
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds to me like you're just able to sandbox.

27:21.397 --> 27:21.777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

27:21.897 --> 27:23.958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously a fun game.

27:23.978 --> 27:31.001
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be playing it probably during the show.

27:31.681 --> 27:32.061
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else to say on Saints Row for now?

27:36.545 --> 27:37.225
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely pick it up.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.206
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great game.

27:38.526 --> 27:39.407
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's worth it.

27:39.847 --> 27:44.931
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen some of the reviewers bitching about how the missions were very linear.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's a mission.

27:47.213 --> 27:48.094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be linear.

27:48.414 --> 27:51.096
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand what they're looking for.

27:51.216 --> 27:53.138
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just so many games out right now.

27:53.158 --> 27:54.859
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't pick up Saints Row right now.

27:54.879 --> 27:55.660
[SPEAKER_08]: There's too much.

27:55.900 --> 27:56.641
[SPEAKER_08]: Too much!

27:57.441 --> 27:57.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

27:58.382 --> 28:00.943
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:23.027 --> 28:26.948
[SPEAKER_08]: One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, I'm sure will come as no surprise to anyone, Skyrim.

28:27.268 --> 28:30.809
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked up on Friday, had it delivered on release day.

28:30.829 --> 28:33.290
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Skyrim quite a bit since Friday.

28:33.810 --> 28:41.853
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very similar to Oblivion where you can, once you do the very first quest in the beginning, you can pretty much go out in the world and do whatever you want.

28:42.233 --> 28:45.174
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that openness really turns some people off.

28:45.874 --> 28:47.895
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was really giving this some thought earlier today.

28:47.915 --> 28:56.199
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really funny because we consider Oblivion a role-playing game, and we consider the Final Fantasy series a role-playing game, when in reality, the two could not be any more different.

28:56.579 --> 28:58.780
[SPEAKER_08]: Those games are so, so different.

28:58.980 --> 29:00.381
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, put them side by side.

29:00.881 --> 29:04.403
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIII, criticized by many for being too linear.

29:04.923 --> 29:05.643
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree.

29:05.723 --> 29:08.725
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was kind of a big part of Final Fantasy XIII.

29:08.845 --> 29:10.365
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very, very story-driven.

29:11.106 --> 29:11.186
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

29:12.146 --> 29:14.529
[SPEAKER_08]: Skyrim, not linear whatsoever.

29:14.669 --> 29:19.654
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yes, there's a main quest, but there's about an eleventy billion other things you can do outside that main quest.

29:19.694 --> 29:23.518
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, now there's this whole, it randomly generates quests.

29:23.718 --> 29:24.379
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like Fable?

29:24.639 --> 29:25.420
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.581
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's better than Fable.

29:26.641 --> 29:26.901
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

29:26.921 --> 29:30.785
[SPEAKER_15]: I meant like though in terms of its exploration.

29:30.805 --> 29:31.486
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

29:31.946 --> 29:37.610
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, yeah, because like some of the more recent Fable games, you kind of go around and do whatever, but it's just even on a bigger scale.

29:38.070 --> 29:44.395
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I love the fact that in Skyrim, you know, and they've been saying this a lot, you look at the top of a mountain, you can climb that mountain.

29:45.215 --> 29:48.217
[SPEAKER_08]: And anywhere you look at from the top of that mountain, you can walk to.

29:48.437 --> 29:49.918
[SPEAKER_08]: It might take you a while to get there, but you can do it.

29:50.119 --> 29:53.081
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some mammoths and giants in your way not wanting you to get there, but you can do it.

29:54.061 --> 29:59.005
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so many randomly generated things that just kind of like make you look away.

29:59.025 --> 29:59.105
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

29:59.645 --> 30:17.571
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think in that sense you know again to compare with Final Fantasy 13 there sometimes is a bit of a grind to it there's numbers you want to out level and you know there is a lot of fun I love Final Fantasy I'm not dogging that at all in fact I think Final Fantasy 13 was really underrated by a lot of the gaming media I think it's a great game

30:18.451 --> 30:45.139
[SPEAKER_08]: but Skyrim is just so different but you can't approach Skyrim like you do a Final Fantasy game or you're setting yourself up for trouble and that can be really hard because there's a lot of people that's like I gotta do and I gotta see everything in the game and I gotta not screw this up because I wanna get the perfect ending and it's like you can't have that in a game that is randomly generating quests if you can't put that aside you're gonna be in trouble I saw some pretty funny videos for Skyrim

30:45.339 --> 30:49.903
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, one of my favorite things about games is how they're slightly buggy.

30:50.163 --> 30:52.105
[SPEAKER_06]: And Oblivion was slightly buggy and it was great.

30:52.645 --> 30:56.068
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if you've seen the video where you put a pot on someone's head.

30:56.468 --> 30:56.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

30:57.009 --> 30:57.729
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.371
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they suddenly can't see.

30:59.451 --> 30:59.971
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

31:02.213 --> 31:05.256
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is funny because in that video, I recognized it.

31:05.316 --> 31:07.579
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, I did that guy's quest.

31:07.659 --> 31:13.925
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, spoiler, if you do his quest to get the Dragon Claw, you will actually complete a story quest ahead of time.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.186
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throwing it out there.

31:15.807 --> 31:16.568
[SPEAKER_08]: Pro tip from me.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.412
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, it's a great game.

31:20.572 --> 31:21.633
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gorgeous to look at.

31:23.334 --> 31:24.514
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

31:25.015 --> 31:26.155
[SPEAKER_08]: You just log in.

31:26.195 --> 31:27.435
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do whatever you want.

31:28.736 --> 31:36.077
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much to do, so much to explore, that sense of gratification, so many ways to develop your character.

31:36.137 --> 31:37.338
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't pick a class anymore.

31:37.378 --> 31:40.038
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not a wizard or a warrior or anything.

31:40.078 --> 31:42.999
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just if you happen to use swords a lot, you skill up in swords.

31:43.319 --> 31:46.560
[SPEAKER_08]: If you happen to stealth around a lot, you level up in sneaking.

31:46.940 --> 31:47.900
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

31:47.980 --> 31:50.281
[SPEAKER_08]: It builds the character as you play it, which is great.

31:50.381 --> 31:53.021
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the constellation talent tree system is great, too.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.022
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can effectively make a battle mage.

31:55.562 --> 31:57.982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's actually what I'm playing right now, pretty much.

31:58.443 --> 31:59.243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's pretty fun.

32:00.903 --> 32:13.846
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the very minor drawbacks I can think of, and there are still some surprising bugs in the game, despite how polished it's supposed to be after five years of development, some very obvious bugs.

32:14.526 --> 32:20.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me tell you, I'm going to say the most nitpicky, crazy thing about a game, like ever.

32:20.287 --> 32:22.847
[SPEAKER_08]: But this seriously is something that I find a little odd.

32:23.548 --> 32:26.848
[SPEAKER_08]: And believe it or not, this is something that's going to appeal to DarkSakura.

32:28.168 --> 32:29.069
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the design.

32:30.089 --> 32:31.089
[SPEAKER_08]: The menu design.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.549
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be really nerdy, like the nerdiest thing you're ever going to hear in a game review.

32:35.150 --> 32:43.671
[SPEAKER_08]: I find the usage of a narrow sans-serif font to be very strange and conflicting to the ambience of what these games are supposed to be about.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.453
[SPEAKER_08]: I am dead fucking serious.

33:11.070 --> 33:14.352
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, for that type of game, I really would agree with you.

33:15.032 --> 33:25.577
[SPEAKER_15]: Except that the thinner, the light styles of Sans Serif's always make me think of a little bit of an ethereal quality.

33:26.998 --> 33:32.901
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would have think that it should have been something a little bit more on the script side.

33:33.041 --> 33:36.743
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also that it's the same font everywhere too, which is a little weird.

33:36.963 --> 33:37.704
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:57.164 --> 34:03.728
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, well, I don't know what the font is in Skyrim, but it's like an Ariel Nero, and it's like, you know, there's only so much of that I can take.

34:03.888 --> 34:04.769
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what Ariel is?

34:05.069 --> 34:05.269
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

34:05.729 --> 34:06.610
[SPEAKER_15]: Poor man's Helvetica.

34:06.630 --> 34:07.391
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway.

34:07.791 --> 34:11.193
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, for serious, because Microsoft made that because they didn't want to pay for Helvetica.

34:11.413 --> 34:11.693
[SPEAKER_15]: The end.

34:12.494 --> 34:12.954
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the truth.

34:14.675 --> 34:16.937
[SPEAKER_15]: At least it's not, like, set in fucking Comic Sans or something.

34:17.297 --> 34:18.238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, that's true.

34:18.518 --> 34:21.020
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Papyrus is another gag me font.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.100
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

34:22.461 --> 34:22.681
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

34:24.955 --> 34:34.283
[SPEAKER_15]: It seemed, the look of it made me think that it was a placeholder text and that they just didn't change it.

34:35.864 --> 34:39.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, this is the most extreme nitpicky thing I have ever talked about in a video game.

34:40.028 --> 34:45.532
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is fantastic and do not let my bitching about the font deter your opinion.

34:46.013 --> 34:50.436
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really care for the high renders of everything in the menu.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.077
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

34:51.697 --> 34:55.720
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone's running it on a PC, that's going to slow down their time.

34:55.780 --> 34:57.682
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear it runs pretty decent on most PCs.

34:58.823 --> 35:03.506
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I did think was weird was that I didn't like how there was two different menus.

35:03.526 --> 35:11.592
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one menu to bring up your quest log and stuff, but then there's another button you have to hit if you want your map or spells or the constellation.

35:12.273 --> 35:14.614
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wish that had all been integrated into one menu.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.396
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was kind of just odd.

35:16.476 --> 35:17.857
[SPEAKER_08]: It felt really weird to play.

35:18.277 --> 35:20.078
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm not sure why it was designed that way.

35:20.378 --> 35:25.079
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't like having two menus because I keep thinking that the map is in the start key and it's not.

35:25.159 --> 35:26.900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the O or the circle.

35:27.220 --> 35:28.540
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just weird.

35:30.321 --> 35:34.302
[SPEAKER_15]: To answer, I wonder who protested the Ikea font change.

35:35.543 --> 35:35.923
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

35:36.483 --> 35:39.444
[SPEAKER_15]: Ikea always needs to use Futura forever.

35:40.704 --> 35:42.425
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Typography Lounge Radio.

35:42.805 --> 35:43.085
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

35:43.706 --> 35:48.391
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, the game is fantastic, but it is a different type of roleplaying game.

35:48.651 --> 35:49.712
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not for everybody.

35:50.132 --> 35:51.434
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you just...

35:53.729 --> 36:16.183
[SPEAKER_08]: in some ways it's like an MMO where you don't have to deal with other people at all it has that open world sense to it and there's so much that you can interact with and do and the whole like quest forever type of thing almost feels like an MMO but without everything that people hate about MMOs which is other people usually so and a monthly fee so but Skyrim's great

36:16.943 --> 36:23.452
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya asks if it's time for the classic font of the week.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.657
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm much more prone to use the word typeface.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.561
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it sounds a little bit classier.

36:30.618 --> 36:33.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Our comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com, of course.

36:34.361 --> 36:39.365
[SPEAKER_15]: The typeface of the week is Adobe Kazalan Pro.

36:39.565 --> 36:39.945
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop.

36:41.086 --> 36:41.827
[SPEAKER_08]: No one care.

36:44.289 --> 36:44.609
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

36:45.070 --> 36:49.973
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get into some gaming news tonight, of course, with you guys live in our chat room and the calls later on.

36:50.053 --> 36:51.254
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic Game of the Week and all that stuff.

36:51.635 --> 36:52.776
[SPEAKER_08]: First, some other quick plugs.

36:52.816 --> 36:55.057
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, if you're not already following us on Facebook, you should be.

36:55.117 --> 36:56.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.

36:57.339 --> 37:19.267
[SPEAKER_08]: and we are on Twitter as well twitter.com slash OLR we are also now on Google Plus we have a brand new Google Plus page I know it's a reason to go back and look at Google Plus but here's what I really like about Google Plus is that because thanks to the whole circle thing we could actually post things on Google Plus that only our listeners could see so if we ever wanted to do like a secret club

37:19.747 --> 37:48.534
[SPEAKER_08]: we could post it on Google Plus because it wouldn't be public so follow us on Google Plus put us in your circles over there and if any juicy gossip comes up you know in the next couple months we will post it so that only the followers in our circles can see kind of like online only secret club otherwise information about the show and pictures and all that stuff it's hard for me to give a URL to Google Plus because you can't have names yet but just search for us just type Orange Launch Radio we'll come right up it's very easy to find I'm sure somebody will link in a chat here in a minute

37:50.078 --> 37:53.899
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really it for housekeeping, so let's get into some news.

38:17.123 --> 38:46.171
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what happens when the game is free I'm kind of curious though I wonder how many of those are actually paying for parts of the game or just you know kind of like you know how I would probably be would just I might want to try that out well from what I understand you can get upgrades to the game for only five bucks like there's two different levels there's one where you can pay like a monthly fee and get all the good stuff and then there's one where you just pay five bucks and you get a lot of little upgrades that's kind of neat I guess it's not bad

38:46.331 --> 38:46.591
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiplayer

39:16.144 --> 39:17.285
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Deathmatch.

39:17.325 --> 39:18.225
[SPEAKER_06]: People like the Deathmatch stuff.

39:18.245 --> 39:22.628
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of multiplayer, I would actually like to check out the Halo Anniversary Edition at some point.

39:22.848 --> 39:24.569
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like original OG Halo.

39:24.869 --> 39:26.250
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to check that out at some point.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.491
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to play Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7.

39:29.972 --> 39:31.372
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you heard about the Halo thing.

39:31.392 --> 39:33.433
[SPEAKER_06]: You know all those Kinect features they were talking about?

39:33.493 --> 39:33.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

39:33.874 --> 39:34.474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not at launch.

39:37.390 --> 39:39.551
[SPEAKER_06]: They apparently are having trouble making them work.

39:39.872 --> 39:40.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, really?

39:40.592 --> 39:49.517
[SPEAKER_06]: You were having trouble making a voice command that changed the resolution from original to the new graphics or whatever?

39:49.897 --> 39:51.878
[SPEAKER_06]: And also a voice command to throw a grenade?

39:52.079 --> 39:53.739
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't make that work at all?

39:56.241 --> 39:56.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade.

39:57.682 --> 39:58.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade.

39:58.202 --> 39:58.502
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

39:59.043 --> 40:01.524
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't understand certain accents.

40:04.062 --> 40:05.903
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like you're saying grenade.

40:06.223 --> 40:06.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade.

40:06.984 --> 40:07.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say lemonade?

40:09.365 --> 40:11.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a fresh glass of lemonade.

40:11.366 --> 40:12.246
[SPEAKER_06]: No, grenade.

40:15.988 --> 40:16.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

40:16.768 --> 40:19.590
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, I guess that's good.

40:20.090 --> 40:23.532
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some other MMOs Final Fantasy XIV should follow suit with that.

40:26.050 --> 40:27.031
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to have to.

40:27.471 --> 40:28.931
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already over Final Fantasy XIV.

40:28.951 --> 40:30.132
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't touched it in like two weeks.

40:31.012 --> 40:34.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Final Fantasy XIV isn't officially in launch until about a year from now.

40:34.454 --> 40:35.434
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see the whole 2.0.

40:36.774 --> 40:38.655
[SPEAKER_08]: At least DC Universe didn't have to launch a 2.0.

40:39.235 --> 40:45.138
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just getting the game that everybody wanted to play, but no one wanted to pay $60 in a monthly fee to play.

40:45.558 --> 40:51.200
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, no shit they got a million people because tons of people wanted to play this game, but they were like, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for it.

40:53.427 --> 40:53.827
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

41:10.700 --> 41:15.144
[SPEAKER_08]: The Simpsons Arcade Game has been classified in Australia.

41:15.565 --> 41:22.271
[SPEAKER_08]: What that means is that the rating has actually shown up on the Australian Classification Board's website.

41:22.612 --> 41:29.759
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems to indicate that the Simpsons Arcade Game could be on its way to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network because...

41:30.599 --> 41:59.284
[SPEAKER_08]: Backbone is the one that is I guess registered the game Backbone Entertainment they do a lot of the like classic games stuff one of the more recent ones they did was the X-Men Arcade port and it is saying it's published by Konami so I don't know how that all works because I thought EA had the license but maybe some agreement was reached after all when the Ninja Turtles arcade game came out they did have a mutual agreement there so maybe something's been worked out so we may be getting the Simpsons arcade game on Xbox Live Arcade very soon which

41:59.824 --> 42:01.025
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes to that.

42:01.065 --> 42:03.146
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day.

42:03.326 --> 42:08.408
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say we did a list list some time ago about Xbox Live Arcade game they most need and that was on it.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.449
[SPEAKER_08]: So, heck yeah, that would be awesome.

42:11.749 --> 42:12.890
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they didn't screw it up.

42:14.170 --> 42:16.351
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's like the X-Men Arcade port, I think it'll be fine.

42:16.871 --> 42:18.912
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the other stuff they've done has been alright.

42:20.713 --> 42:21.914
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura.

42:23.514 --> 42:26.396
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I was checking the mailbox again to make sure we actually had something this time.

42:27.376 --> 42:27.576
[SPEAKER_15]: We do.

42:28.036 --> 42:29.237
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray.

42:30.020 --> 42:34.584
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been going around, people have been talking about it, about the security breach with Valve.

42:35.465 --> 42:40.609
[SPEAKER_15]: Valve actually did acknowledge that users' personal information had been compromised.

42:40.629 --> 42:42.631
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a security breach.

42:43.792 --> 42:56.302
[SPEAKER_15]: They said that they accessed a Steam database in addition to the forums that usernames, passwords, game purchases, email address, billing addresses, credit card information...

42:57.283 --> 43:26.410
[SPEAKER_15]: um they don't have evidence that credit card information or personal identification was taken um or that the protection on them was cracked they're still trying to get into that but um they said watch your stuff very closely which is why the only thing that's remotely linked on my Steam account is that I use PayPal that's it well lucky you but yeah my credit card of course was on Steam go figure

43:27.216 --> 43:32.322
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't think the new one is, because mine elapsed during the year, and I'm not sure I ever put the new one on.

43:32.342 --> 43:35.726
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really buy a lot of stuff on Steam, and when I do, I just get it through PayPal.

43:35.766 --> 43:36.947
[SPEAKER_08]: I buy tons on Steam.

43:37.468 --> 43:41.553
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, I don't know.

43:41.793 --> 43:45.798
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd think I'd be more pissed off about this because of what happened with Sony, but I don't know.

43:45.818 --> 43:46.759
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain...

43:48.806 --> 43:53.489
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain trust you kind of have with Valve because they get so much other stuff.

43:53.609 --> 43:58.913
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of feel like they're being a little more upfront with this than maybe necessarily Sony was.

43:59.433 --> 44:02.575
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do feel like a lot of the data was probably encrypted pretty well.

44:03.175 --> 44:03.376
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

44:04.156 --> 44:23.583
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know well here's a statement from Newell we do not know of any compromised Steam accounts so we are not planning to force a change of Steam account passwords which are separate from the forum passwords however it wouldn't be a bad idea to change that as well especially if it's the same as your Steam forum account password so

44:26.533 --> 44:47.491
[SPEAKER_08]: I think also at the end of the day, the fault of this is not Valve's fault, it's the hacker's fault I don't know what Valve did to necessarily provoke this besides maybe Gabe Newell getting up there at GDC and saying that it was unhackable and kind of daring people to do it at some point I don't think that he would do that

44:47.991 --> 44:50.653
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't quite the way I'm saying it either.

44:50.713 --> 44:54.476
[SPEAKER_08]: He was just kind of showing about the security protection and all that, the Steam Guard and all that.

44:55.376 --> 44:57.818
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, these guys weren't in there to steal games.

44:58.939 --> 45:01.920
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe they didn't steal the credit card information.

45:02.321 --> 45:05.743
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Valve is just being very upfront that, hey, that information was at risk.

45:06.604 --> 45:08.085
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.

45:08.185 --> 45:13.028
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation Network kind of felt like a Benny Hill show from the beginning.

45:13.628 --> 45:17.431
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one person tripping over another from there.

45:18.031 --> 45:45.699
[SPEAKER_08]: but I mean obviously I'm not like I'm a little bit upset and I'd like to kind of see what Valve is going to do to make sure that my information doesn't stay at risk you know I want to hear more constant updates about what they do find out about what was taken and not and if they do suspect that credit card information was taken then they need to offer a lot of the same services like the debix and all that that PlayStation was offering but I don't know I kind of trust them to do a better job with their PR than I do Sony

45:47.702 --> 46:09.839
[SPEAKER_08]: at the end of the day no one ever had money taken from them on Sony either so and hopefully nobody has money taken from them on Valve either chat.orangeloundtrader.com some of the comments Salacious Pop says the credit card info they got as hashed encrypted to shit so they'd have to crack that to do anything also Steam only lets you store one card on and it's very easy to delete it

46:10.699 --> 46:29.669
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says Steam only saves the last cards you used GameGuru says Valve is how you are supposed to address being hacked DarkTetsuya says I did change my password even though I didn't really have any credit card info on it just out of habit for this sort of thing and that's a really good habit to have and if you haven't changed your Steam password you probably just should

46:30.629 --> 46:32.370
[SPEAKER_08]: What's to lose from doing it?

46:32.710 --> 46:38.011
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's ever given me a good reason why you shouldn't change your password besides I can't keep track of all those different passwords.

46:38.071 --> 46:42.072
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're going to have to come up with a better excuse than that in this day and age.

46:42.352 --> 46:42.852
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

46:44.712 --> 46:46.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo has a very good point, though.

46:46.213 --> 46:49.053
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because Valve is run by nerds doesn't mean they're hack-proof.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is.

46:50.794 --> 46:53.054
[SPEAKER_08]: And GameGuru also puts this pretty clear here.

46:53.434 --> 46:54.915
[SPEAKER_08]: Valve's been clear and upfront.

46:55.035 --> 46:56.535
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony tried to hide everything.

46:56.975 --> 46:57.696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, too.

46:57.756 --> 47:04.360
[SPEAKER_08]: I do seem to remember that Sony, you know, the network was still up for a few days after, and then it was bad.

47:04.680 --> 47:11.004
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeOnlineRadio.com is the place where those comments are coming from right now, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

47:11.864 --> 47:17.008
[SPEAKER_08]: Khasin in our chat room, K-H-A-S-N, says, I need to check my credit card transactions.

47:17.308 --> 47:19.909
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just a good thing to do anyway.

47:20.370 --> 47:23.972
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, this should motivate you to do that, but just, I think...

47:24.412 --> 47:28.494
[SPEAKER_08]: Check them at least once a week, if not like three times a week.

47:28.834 --> 47:30.155
[SPEAKER_08]: I check my bank account every day.

47:30.255 --> 47:34.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Just A, I like to know how much money is in there because who actually balances a checkbook anymore?

47:35.437 --> 47:40.980
[SPEAKER_08]: And B, I just like to see that all the transactions that are going through are things that I actually initiated.

47:41.645 --> 47:46.868
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, before the show, I checked my PayPal, just to be sure.

47:46.988 --> 47:49.089
[SPEAKER_15]: And, of course, there's nothing, because I'm broke.

47:49.429 --> 47:49.769
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

47:50.069 --> 47:50.929
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you want to see.

47:51.090 --> 47:51.470
[SPEAKER_15]: But, yeah.

47:52.030 --> 47:56.952
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the last thing on there was last month when I bought the Humble Indie Bundle.

47:57.893 --> 47:58.233
[SPEAKER_15]: That was it.

47:58.613 --> 47:58.813
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

48:00.314 --> 48:00.574
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

48:01.925 --> 48:05.631
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well hopefully we'll get more information on that in the weeks to come as to who did it.

48:06.212 --> 48:07.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang them up by their balls.

48:07.675 --> 48:08.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Who done it?

48:08.557 --> 48:08.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Who done it?

48:09.759 --> 48:11.322
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Miss Scarlet in the conservatory.

48:12.845 --> 48:16.128
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Steam isn't the only thing to get hacked this week.

48:16.409 --> 48:26.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the My Resistance website, the official website for the game Resistance from Sony, got hacked as well, and their forums are down as well.

48:28.780 --> 48:37.808
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, there's no... It hasn't been immediately verified by Insomniac or Sony whether...

48:38.969 --> 48:39.551
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything was done.

48:39.591 --> 48:48.608
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anything's really compromised other than these people's usernames and passwords and maybe emails because you don't store credit card information on this website.

48:51.767 --> 48:54.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, yeah, it sucks.

48:54.948 --> 48:55.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers are going to hack.

48:57.088 --> 48:57.748
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

48:57.788 --> 49:00.289
[SPEAKER_08]: We have said that before.

49:00.529 --> 49:02.409
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they get from this besides?

49:02.429 --> 49:06.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's not like they have credit cards on the Resistance site or anything like that, right?

49:06.970 --> 49:17.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what they could be doing is they could be harvesting usernames and passwords, maybe emails and stuff to try to run those against logins on the PlayStation Network.

49:18.352 --> 49:26.197
[SPEAKER_06]: to see if any of those people have the same username, password, login info that they would on both of those.

49:27.217 --> 49:32.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if maybe there's a way to link your account to that site or something.

49:32.661 --> 49:34.482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you'd have to put your password in there for that.

49:34.882 --> 49:46.629
[SPEAKER_06]: But my guess is it's mainly just to find username, password combos that they can try at a bunch of different websites and see if people are using the same things and maybe get access to accounts that way.

49:48.453 --> 49:50.975
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well more hacking stories.

49:51.316 --> 49:56.921
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox hackings are still kind of slowly bubbling through the press and so forth.

49:57.421 --> 50:02.926
[SPEAKER_08]: I've addressed this on a show before, if you forgot, I had $150 stolen from my Xbox back in August.

50:02.946 --> 50:06.009
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about August 14th, 15th or so that that happened.

50:06.469 --> 50:12.171
[SPEAKER_08]: and I basically lost access to my Xbox for a month while they were investigating and finally got my money back.

50:12.311 --> 50:15.712
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was about 28 days after the incident had happened.

50:16.213 --> 50:20.814
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was out 150 bucks for 28 days and that's not something I know everybody can afford to do.

50:21.494 --> 50:22.515
[SPEAKER_08]: So you gotta be very careful.

50:23.175 --> 50:28.877
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft refuses that anything is going on but I know at least 10 individuals that this has happened to.

50:29.197 --> 50:30.257
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not making that number up.

50:30.498 --> 50:34.539
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I have a lot of Facebook friends and people on Twitter but I know at least 10 individuals

50:34.739 --> 50:49.938
[SPEAKER_08]: and then I still have people telling me like friends of friends and so forth so I know that doesn't seem like a very large number but considering I know people all through the spectrum from people who play games all the time every day to people that hadn't touched their account in one to two years

50:50.879 --> 50:52.800
[SPEAKER_08]: That tells me that something's going on.

50:53.360 --> 50:56.961
[SPEAKER_08]: And this shit made me angry this week as I saw that there was a report on Eurogamer.

50:57.001 --> 50:58.001
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not mad at Eurogamer.

50:58.021 --> 50:58.901
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just reporting it.

50:58.981 --> 51:00.042
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't shoot the messenger, right?

51:00.562 --> 51:16.887
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently Microsoft is claiming that all these FIFA Ultimate Team Pack purchases that are the, quote, hacks going on, Microsoft is claiming in an interview with Eurogamer from Online Safety Director Doug Park, it is not a hack, that it is some type of, quote, new attack vector.

51:17.207 --> 51:18.287
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, it's not a hack.

51:18.667 --> 51:21.729
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really just a different way to monetize stolen accounts.

51:23.069 --> 51:23.289
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

51:24.750 --> 51:26.131
[SPEAKER_08]: Any service has compromises.

51:26.251 --> 51:27.611
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook has compromises.

51:27.711 --> 51:28.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow has compromises.

51:29.232 --> 51:32.073
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're really doing is trying to make money off those compromises.

51:32.394 --> 51:34.214
[SPEAKER_08]: So FIFA is a very popular title.

51:34.475 --> 51:36.556
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a new way for the bad guys to make money.

51:36.876 --> 51:38.597
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't based on our investigation.

51:38.677 --> 51:39.717
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't see anything new.

51:39.837 --> 51:41.098
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a different avenue.

51:41.858 --> 51:45.541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not getting into super detail, but there's basics of account compromise.

51:45.581 --> 51:48.583
[SPEAKER_08]: There's phishing, there's social engineering, there's malware.

51:48.863 --> 51:51.905
[SPEAKER_08]: Based off the industry today, most of it comes off malware and phishing.

51:51.985 --> 51:53.526
[SPEAKER_08]: If they get the accounts, they sell it.

51:53.887 --> 51:55.108
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really all they were doing.

51:55.168 --> 52:01.492
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it's FIFA or an account with a PlayStation subscription or an account with a live subscription, it's all basically the same thing.

52:02.813 --> 52:09.618
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, he's deflecting, he's refusing to accept that anything's going wrong at Xbox, and you, sir, are lying.

52:10.933 --> 52:18.267
[SPEAKER_08]: you may not know you're lying but I'm here to tell you that these claims that this is all like phishing and all this stuff you're full of crap

52:19.281 --> 52:19.741
[SPEAKER_08]: Wake up!

52:20.301 --> 52:22.082
[SPEAKER_08]: Because something deeper is going on here.

52:22.242 --> 52:24.783
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has to do with Xbox, and it has to do with EA.

52:25.623 --> 52:27.764
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will poke a hole in this right now.

52:28.244 --> 52:30.845
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that are getting hacked, it's not just FIFA.

52:31.565 --> 52:32.405
[SPEAKER_08]: Dun-dun-dun!

52:33.045 --> 52:34.426
[SPEAKER_08]: It's other EA games.

52:35.166 --> 52:38.287
[SPEAKER_08]: I know somebody that got money stolen out of Madden.

52:38.867 --> 52:44.269
[SPEAKER_08]: I know somebody where the first game that they went into to go play on it was...

52:45.629 --> 52:46.250
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:06.294 --> 53:15.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone show me a game or an Xbox hack that's going on that did not somehow involve an EA product?

53:16.363 --> 53:17.244
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone show that?

53:18.245 --> 53:28.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.orangenowlandsradio.com Twitter.com slash OLR Is anyone that's been impacted, where money has been taken out of the account, was an EA game not involved?

53:28.935 --> 53:31.197
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll tell you what, I think I know the link.

53:33.448 --> 53:40.132
[SPEAKER_08]: The link is, I believe that the people that are getting hacked are people that do not play EA Sports games.

53:42.873 --> 53:50.217
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never played an EA Sports game on Xbox Live, save for Burnout Paradise, which does not have the EA Network.

53:51.277 --> 53:55.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the other, like Rock Band, which isn't a part of that new EA Network and all that.

53:56.120 --> 54:02.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people that I know that have been hacked do not play EA Sports games online, or they have not played their Xbox in several years.

54:04.688 --> 54:12.071
[SPEAKER_08]: if you do not have your Xbox account tied to the new EA system you are vulnerable

54:13.726 --> 54:35.241
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that I don't have any proof but trending that I see so I'm just some schmo on a podcast putting that out there whatever take it or leave it but I'm telling you I think if you want to best protect yourself one thing that you should do right now well in addition to change your password which I've told you 5,000 times to do and if you haven't done it by now I don't know what to tell you but I think what you should do

54:36.141 --> 54:43.824
[SPEAKER_08]: Go download the demo for either NBA Jam on Fire or Need for Speed The Run, which, granted, wasn't a bad demo.

54:44.444 --> 54:48.325
[SPEAKER_08]: When you play those demos, you're going to have to create an EA account to get onto those servers.

54:48.885 --> 54:56.888
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you'll establish a link between your Xbox and your EA account because I'm telling you, when I got hacked, they linked a fake account up.

54:57.768 --> 55:22.929
[SPEAKER_08]: and somehow there's some vulnerability there that neither Microsoft nor EA will admit but I'm telling you there's too much of a trend here for me to ignore as a gamer as somebody who doesn't want the fans of this show to lose money I'm just telling you what I'm seeing in all these other cases are people that have not linked the EA account through some type of sports title are the ones that are being hacked I don't know how they're doing it but that's the common denominator damn it

55:23.248 --> 55:40.830
[SPEAKER_06]: at the very least going ahead and associating it with an account would prevent whatever exploit there might be from being used I don't think it's necessarily that they're not getting hacked it's just that they're not buying anything with it because once they find out oh well I can't get access to the EA thing then well not much I can do there

55:42.699 --> 55:48.283
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that this bozo would go out there and say that we're all being phished.

55:48.863 --> 55:49.624
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's wrong.

55:49.804 --> 55:53.787
[SPEAKER_08]: I know somebody that hadn't touched their Xbox in two years.

55:54.748 --> 55:57.490
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm supposed to believe that guy somehow got phished?

55:57.910 --> 56:03.874
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I haven't played my Xbox in two years, but shit, I'm gonna log onto this website and just give them my Xbox login.

56:04.335 --> 56:04.615
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?! !

56:07.225 --> 56:36.188
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to think I'm somewhat smarter than that too I mean I like to think I mean I'm not gonna be all Sony big in the head about it that I am in penetratable when it comes to getting you know my information fished or whatever but I'd like to think I always think twice about links I click on and websites I'm visiting and make sure the websites are genuine so if this guy's gonna come out and say that I'm getting fished you better be ready to throw down because you might be wrong and if you're wrong I'm gonna be double mad

56:42.540 --> 56:57.227
[SPEAKER_08]: 5thDream in our chatroom at chat.orangesoundstrater.com says you'd be amazed how many people don't know the password that their email address associated with their Xbox Live accounts get it reset, you gotta do something take control of that, especially if you have a credit card tied to it

56:57.927 --> 57:26.856
[SPEAKER_08]: they're getting in there somehow I don't know what they're doing I don't know how they're doing it if we knew it would be all over the gaming media but nobody can figure out how they're doing it and Microsoft won't admit that there's a problem because somehow they're both being used Microsoft and EA and I don't I can't figure out how somebody's gonna figure it out though honestly I think they should start looking into their password reset system

57:27.634 --> 57:37.863
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say one more thing about this because this is the other thing that this guy is deflecting because he tries to throw all these other companies under the bus and he says any service has compromises.

57:38.263 --> 57:39.585
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow has compromises.

57:40.405 --> 57:41.286
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, true point.

57:41.446 --> 57:42.908
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also had my Wow account hacked.

57:43.188 --> 57:45.950
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know how that happened and I do think that was phishing.

57:46.010 --> 57:49.654
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I used, I logged into a computer that I shouldn't have logged into Wow in.

57:49.714 --> 57:50.734
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay, fair enough.

57:50.815 --> 57:52.796
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, again, I said earlier, I'm not perfect.

57:53.097 --> 57:54.278
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't happen, okay?

57:54.979 --> 57:58.750
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a big difference between what WoW is doing and what Microsoft's doing.

58:00.899 --> 58:04.502
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard will openly admit that your accounts are vulnerable to theft.

58:04.902 --> 58:07.264
[SPEAKER_08]: That people will try and steal your Xbox accounts.

58:07.664 --> 58:17.312
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard will sell an authenticator so that you can get into your accounts and try to bring incentives for you to use those authenticators like free pets and so forth.

58:17.612 --> 58:21.235
[SPEAKER_08]: They've come up with new ways of authentication like authenticating by phone.

58:21.475 --> 58:24.117
[SPEAKER_08]: They are constantly trying to change the security in their system.

58:24.378 --> 58:25.679
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing, Microsoft?

58:26.439 --> 58:28.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're watching the situation very closely.

58:30.146 --> 58:35.170
[SPEAKER_15]: On top of that, they give away the authenticator for free and the only thing that you have to pay for is if you buy a physical authenticator.

58:35.270 --> 58:35.611
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

58:35.631 --> 58:37.152
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the mobile phone authenticator for free.

58:37.172 --> 58:37.913
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is what I use.

58:38.013 --> 58:38.653
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.

58:38.733 --> 58:39.194
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

58:40.395 --> 58:41.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft doesn't have anything like that.

58:42.216 --> 58:45.339
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft doesn't tell people to change their passwords regularly.

58:45.599 --> 58:49.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft won't admit that there's people out there trying to steal money from your account.

58:50.163 --> 59:19.146
[SPEAKER_08]: and at least if they're doing it I'm sure they would come back and say well Rob it is right here on the website okay on some page people never look at and a font size not big enough anyone can see it it is right there on the login screen as you're waiting for the game to load on WoW protect your account from theft do A, B, and C that's the level of stuff that Microsoft needs to do because accounts are being stolen and it's not just you know because we're all stupid when it comes to learning the internet

59:20.757 --> 59:22.159
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I've ranted enough.

59:22.579 --> 59:22.879
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

59:23.340 --> 59:25.022
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just, it just irritates me.

59:25.442 --> 59:30.147
[SPEAKER_08]: This is such corporate, you know, just talking out his butt.

59:30.948 --> 59:35.793
[SPEAKER_08]: And it irritates me the more Microsoft tries to deny that anything is wrong.

59:36.124 --> 59:39.925
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what another term for talking out of your butt is?

59:40.405 --> 59:40.765
[SPEAKER_15]: Farting.

59:41.986 --> 59:42.706
[SPEAKER_15]: Or shit.

59:42.806 --> 59:44.026
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I was dumb, but I'm not.

59:44.166 --> 59:56.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Furthermore, maybe it would irritate me a lot less if that, you know, the other part of this is that I was locked out of my Xbox account for 28 days.

59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.251
[SPEAKER_08]: How long was I out of my WoW account when I got hacked?

01:00:02.651 --> 01:00:02.951
[SPEAKER_08]: A day?

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:03.672
[SPEAKER_08]: An hour.

01:00:04.472 --> 01:00:04.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:08.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Fix it, Microsoft!

01:00:09.935 --> 01:00:10.895
[SPEAKER_15]: And have better fonts.

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:13.497
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

01:00:30.948 --> 01:00:41.775
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's actually, um, there's also the beacons functionality added in so that, um, you can, um, say which games you would like to play with other people.

01:00:42.015 --> 01:00:43.295
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's actually on Xbox Live now.

01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:51.380
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, new messaging, new browsing, um, new searching for films and TV, that type of thing.

01:00:52.201 --> 01:00:56.003
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, they have a new interface that goes with the Metro UI theme.

01:00:57.124 --> 01:00:57.344
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:02.629
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that's cool, but honestly it's not enough.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.811
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's something.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.384
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's better than what was there before, which was, you know, he's still having to call support and all that stuff.

01:01:11.444 --> 01:01:18.790
[SPEAKER_08]: But by the way, just just to throw it out there, certain other subscription things you cannot cancel online as easily still.

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:21.412
[SPEAKER_08]: So although it may make it sound like there's certain things.

01:01:21.692 --> 01:01:24.034
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, I tried to go in the first thing I tried to do.

01:01:24.695 --> 01:01:25.996
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did Microsoft.

01:01:26.176 --> 01:01:26.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

01:01:26.837 --> 01:01:28.098
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm so mad at them lately.

01:01:28.578 --> 01:01:31.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did Microsoft automatically update my credit card info.

01:01:32.561 --> 01:01:33.261
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what they did.

01:01:33.281 --> 01:01:35.062
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they guess the new expiration date?

01:01:35.462 --> 01:01:40.444
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how they did it, but they automatically updated my credit card information.

01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:41.545
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remove it.

01:01:42.605 --> 01:01:46.547
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't remove your credit card on the website.

01:01:46.587 --> 01:01:56.431
[SPEAKER_08]: You try to click remove and it goes, you cannot remove this card because you are currently using this card to pay for your one month card of Xbox Live.

01:01:57.594 --> 01:01:58.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:58.475 --> 01:02:04.299
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remove my credit card because I'm using it to fund a prepaid Xbox Live card?

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:09.223
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's when you report it to the Better Business Bureau.

01:02:12.325 --> 01:02:12.926
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridiculous.

01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:15.608
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rob, you're paying for the free card.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:16.328
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

01:02:16.669 --> 01:02:18.370
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, but you're paying for the free card.

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:02:23.424 --> 01:02:24.004
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hilarious.

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:28.367
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not in a funny way, but just... I was like, seriously?

01:02:28.587 --> 01:02:29.867
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are going to go that far?

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:37.711
[SPEAKER_08]: So much smoke and mirrors from Microsoft to the point where I am seriously considering the next console.

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:40.333
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody called me out on Twitter, too, about it, which is fine.

01:02:40.513 --> 01:02:41.233
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

01:02:41.253 --> 01:02:41.893
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an opinion.

01:02:41.933 --> 01:02:45.055
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think there's a problem with it, then whatever.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:52.139
[SPEAKER_08]: But somebody had said, wait, you were mad at Microsoft when PlayStation was the one that got hacked and all that?

01:02:53.119 --> 01:03:00.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair point, but still, has anyone presented a case where somebody actually had money stolen from them from PlayStation?

01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:02.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone been able to prove that?

01:03:03.683 --> 01:03:07.664
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I could prove to you about 10 different cases of money being stolen.

01:03:08.424 --> 01:03:11.385
[SPEAKER_08]: Many, many more if you look at the web forums that are out there on Xbox.

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:13.926
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we all mad at Sony again?

01:03:17.607 --> 01:03:19.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of the potential loss.

01:03:20.154 --> 01:03:21.435
[SPEAKER_06]: The potential, Rob.

01:03:22.697 --> 01:03:23.778
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna be mad at Sony.

01:03:23.838 --> 01:03:30.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Be mad at Sony about, you know, them Bumble fucking tripping over their own feet in handling the situation.

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.667
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, Microsoft's really no better.

01:03:34.824 --> 01:03:35.705
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is their MO.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:38.648
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at what they did with the Red Ring systems and stuff like that.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was a small percentage.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.951
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was like 1%.

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:47.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely not 100% or 50% or whatever.

01:03:47.175 --> 01:03:48.096
[SPEAKER_08]: So just flip it.

01:03:48.136 --> 01:03:48.937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm saying.

01:03:49.297 --> 01:03:50.919
[SPEAKER_08]: The folks that are saying that, flip it.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you give Microsoft a pass all the time?

01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.548
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be equally critical of all the game companies.

01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:02.836
[SPEAKER_06]: We should.

01:04:02.856 --> 01:04:04.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, why aren't you embracing online?

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.879
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we should when we give them hundreds of dollars.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.541
[SPEAKER_08]: Which we do.

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:11.405
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a right to be critical of a company I'm giving hundreds of dollars to.

01:04:13.428 --> 01:04:15.290
[SPEAKER_08]: That holds my credit card hostage, but anyway.

01:04:16.511 --> 01:04:17.032
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

01:04:17.072 --> 01:04:18.774

[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's based on an anime.

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:12.599

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:21.267

01:11:27.573 --> 01:11:32.838

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:51.971
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks like it could be very impressive, actually.

01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:53.672
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks... Oh, it's all cartoony.

01:11:54.612 --> 01:11:55.692
[SPEAKER_08]: That game's very cute.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:56.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me look.

01:11:56.293 --> 01:11:56.573
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait.

01:11:56.593 --> 01:11:56.853
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back.

01:11:56.953 --> 01:11:57.733
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

01:11:58.753 --> 01:12:00.754
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Studio Ghibli on PlayStation 3.

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:01.995
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cute.

01:12:02.255 --> 01:12:02.475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:12:03.735 --> 01:12:06.036
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks like it would be worth importing.

01:12:06.237 --> 01:12:06.897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:12:07.037 --> 01:12:09.618
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Ni no Kuni.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:11.999
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a magical land on the PlayStation 3.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.001
[SPEAKER_08]: The orphan Oliver is determined to save his mother who died to save him.

01:12:16.361 --> 01:12:23.545
[SPEAKER_08]: In order to do so, he followed Shizuku, the fairy of the tears, into the world of Ni no Kuni to defeat the evil magician Jabo.

01:12:23.565 --> 01:12:23.865
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh.

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:26.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Ni no Kuni

01:12:50.732 --> 01:13:00.885
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to the PSP, Angelique Amarin no Rokukishi comes out this week as well as Uminiko no Naku Koroni Portable 2 from Alchemist.

01:13:03.786 --> 01:13:03.986
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

01:13:28.442 --> 01:13:31.086
[SPEAKER_15]: In Europe, on the 15th, we have... Well, this is UK.

01:13:31.506 --> 01:13:39.336
[SPEAKER_15]: Assassin's Creed Revelations, I, Pet and Friends, Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, Medieval Moves, Deadman's Quest, and Roshard.

01:13:40.397 --> 01:13:42.901
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have on the 18th...

01:13:44.423 --> 01:13:59.624
[SPEAKER_15]: Anno 2070, LEGO Harry Potter Years 5-7, Marathon, Need for Speed The Run, Saints Row III, Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Apache Air Assault for PC.

01:14:00.245 --> 01:14:00.665
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:01.446
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy, busy.

01:14:02.306 --> 01:14:07.469
[SPEAKER_08]: In our chat room, by the way, they are talking about Ni No Kuni, which I had mentioned before, the Studio Ghibli game.

01:14:07.489 --> 01:14:12.652
[SPEAKER_08]: They are saying, some folks, Alpha Cananogram says, they did say that it's coming to North America, I think.

01:14:12.692 --> 01:14:14.413
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dark Tetsuya says, I thought it was coming out over here.

01:14:14.753 --> 01:14:16.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it probably is, but not this week.

01:14:16.955 --> 01:14:18.055
[SPEAKER_08]: Japan's getting it first.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:21.677
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're getting it, what, summer next year, maybe?

01:14:21.817 --> 01:14:22.218
[SPEAKER_08]: Spring.

01:14:22.518 --> 01:14:22.838
[SPEAKER_08]: Spring.

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you looked it up, huh?

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:26.140
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just know.

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:27.230
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well.

01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:28.971
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are getting it.

01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:30.831
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to take a little time for the translation.

01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:31.191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:35.152
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:14:35.712 --> 01:14:47.416
[SPEAKER_06]: But first... Well, everyone's been wondering with the Vita, is there going to be a way for me to import my games that I may have on UMD to the Vita?

01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:48.656
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer is yes.

01:14:48.876 --> 01:14:50.196
[SPEAKER_06]: There is actually a way to do that.

01:14:50.596 --> 01:14:52.977
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not free, but...

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.659
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:29.833
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course they haven't announced prices over here yet since the Vita is still a ways away but in Japan it ranges between an average of 500 and 1000 yen so it's not bad I mean that's a pretty good compromise I think

01:15:31.134 --> 01:15:39.723
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, really, if you want to abuse that, you could take a friend's, you know, UMD or rent a UMD or something like that, pop it in there, register it like you own it.

01:15:40.123 --> 01:15:45.548
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's no way for them to know, but at least you get a little bit of a discount if you're planning on actually buying the game anyways.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:52.335
[SPEAKER_08]: I still don't like the fact that I'm having to basically put in the UMD to have the privilege of paying for the game all over again.

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:54.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I get it.

01:15:54.737 --> 01:15:55.318
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sucks.

01:15:55.868 --> 01:15:58.850
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the only reason they're doing that is because they know people are going to abuse it.

01:15:59.631 --> 01:16:00.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they can.

01:16:01.152 --> 01:16:08.498
[SPEAKER_06]: And because, really, just play it on your PSP then if you don't want to pay for it.

01:16:10.459 --> 01:16:11.160
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:15.463
[SPEAKER_08]: Still, wouldn't it be nice if they just had true backwards compatibility?

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:17.505
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess you can't do that when you change formats.

01:16:19.502 --> 01:16:36.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow Well it's going to be backwards compatible It's just obviously you can't Not really though Well There's no UMD drive, big deal It's an antiquated format Alright, moving on What about the digital copies of games I bought?

01:16:36.298 --> 01:16:39.961
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought 32nd Hero digitally Will I be able to just download that to my Vita?

01:16:40.101 --> 01:16:42.744
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes Okay, then I'm fine Then that's good

01:16:43.923 --> 01:16:46.525
[SPEAKER_06]: All that stuff is tied to your network account and you can redownload to that.

01:16:46.985 --> 01:16:49.368
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just UMD games.

01:16:49.988 --> 01:16:52.431
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way to transfer that because they're not going to make a UMD drive.

01:16:52.471 --> 01:16:54.432
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a little better then.

01:16:55.453 --> 01:17:00.758
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to information about Super Mario 3D Land, which was of course a big release today.

01:17:00.778 --> 01:17:01.439
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out today.

01:17:01.859 --> 01:17:03.421
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are very excited about that.

01:17:03.861 --> 01:17:07.044
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to pick this up at some point amongst all the other games.

01:17:07.845 --> 01:17:08.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

01:17:09.406 --> 01:17:15.990
[SPEAKER_06]: It is one of the games I want to get for the 3DS, but I just don't see myself playing it anytime soon, and I'm in no big hurry.

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:16.830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Mario game.

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:20.212
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's going to be good, but it's not like I've got to rush out and go get it.

01:17:20.993 --> 01:17:22.294
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been hearing a lot of good things about it.

01:17:22.514 --> 01:17:26.616
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting really good reviews, but it's getting lost amongst all the Modern Warfare and Skyrim chatter.

01:17:26.856 --> 01:17:28.978
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is one for the younger crowd, too.

01:17:29.058 --> 01:17:32.440
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminds me a lot of Mario Galaxy, but just in the 3DS.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:56.403
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's not a bad thing because Mario Galaxy is fucking great but anyway there is a help system in the game a lot of the newer Nintendo games have kind of held your hand a little bit if you constantly fuck up and Mario 3D Land is no different it's been revealed through people playing the game today that if you die twice you'll get a free power up at the beginning of the level like a random power up that happens if you die five times in a level

01:17:57.043 --> 01:18:01.288
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a Tanooki suit that's basically invincibility the whole way through the level.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:04.571
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like you can't die unless you are just a baddie.

01:18:06.734 --> 01:18:10.918
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really will help you handle... I mean, can you imagine if the original Mario Brothers had did that?

01:18:10.998 --> 01:18:13.701
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, you're having problems beating World 8 too?

01:18:14.042 --> 01:18:15.403
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get through these Hammer Brothers?

01:18:15.723 --> 01:18:17.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, have invincibility through the entire level.

01:18:19.298 --> 01:18:21.640
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just why I saved P-Wings and flew over the whole damn thing.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.462
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where we're at now.

01:18:24.722 --> 01:18:29.365
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's the interesting thing though is that you're only allowed to do that the first time you beat a level.

01:18:30.065 --> 01:18:35.369
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're trying to go back and look for coins, be a completionist and so forth, you don't get help.

01:18:36.069 --> 01:18:41.773
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're going to go collect coins and shit, you better do it the first time you have that Tanooki suit because you won't be getting it again.

01:18:43.454 --> 01:18:45.396
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the help in Mario 3D.

01:18:46.696 --> 01:18:50.398
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what's all this newfangled 3D stuff?

01:18:51.099 --> 01:18:53.100
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember a time when gaming was simpler?

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:56.442
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have all this newfangled 3D Mario Galaxy.

01:18:58.463 --> 01:19:00.024
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we had Super Mario Bros.

01:19:00.044 --> 01:19:00.064
[SPEAKER_08]: 2D.

01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:02.836
[SPEAKER_08]: We liked it.

01:19:03.357 --> 01:19:11.321
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to travel back to a simpler time where DarkSakura is going to get into the Classic Gaming Vault and find a game that she says, Hey, hey, I don't want to hear about your Skyrim.

01:19:11.742 --> 01:19:15.023
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear about your Modern Warfare, your 3DSs.

01:19:15.604 --> 01:19:17.245
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about your Skyrim job.

01:19:18.065 --> 01:19:20.767
[SPEAKER_08]: Go play this game because this is Classic Gaming.

01:19:21.232 --> 01:19:24.333
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that you should play the intro to the game.

01:19:25.074 --> 01:19:26.694
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are just going to pick it up right from the start.

01:19:26.714 --> 01:19:27.875
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to get it right away.

01:19:27.895 --> 01:19:31.276
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well then let's go right to the intro of this week's classic game of the week.

01:19:31.316 --> 01:19:39.739
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an oldie goodie.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe you were like five when this game came out.

01:19:44.841 --> 01:19:46.362
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I said rock on purpose.

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.343
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet a lot of our listeners were.

01:19:49.694 --> 01:20:03.053
[SPEAKER_15]: Mega Man X, also known as Rockman X which came out on Super Nintendo or also the Super Famicom in 1993 in Japan 1994 in North America

01:20:05.456 --> 01:20:07.037
[SPEAKER_15]: There's PC versions, yay.

01:20:08.078 --> 01:20:11.920
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is probably one of the best of the series.

01:20:12.801 --> 01:20:21.346
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's like, in the future, Mega Man X was made by Dr. Light, and stored away in a capsule for 30 years, and Dr. Light probably died.

01:20:22.047 --> 01:20:32.894
[SPEAKER_15]: So this other one named Dr. Kane finds him, and, well, he made a bunch of robots based on X, and they all went crazy, so basically X has to go stop him.

01:20:33.354 --> 01:20:35.555
[SPEAKER_15]: We have zero in this game, that's awesome!

01:20:36.295 --> 01:20:44.278
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, this is what really, I think, where the Mega Man games were really cool, you know?

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:45.819
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've always thought they were really awesome.

01:20:45.839 --> 01:20:55.142
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, though, that having the X series really kind of launched it into the next level, if you'll pardon me for using the phrase.

01:20:56.103 --> 01:20:56.463
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you think?

01:20:58.378 --> 01:21:03.483
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, as it went through, we had more characters.

01:21:03.503 --> 01:21:05.465
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, there was Zero who was brought in.

01:21:05.565 --> 01:21:10.770
[SPEAKER_15]: There was Axel, Sigma, you know, as the bad guy.

01:21:13.172 --> 01:21:16.635
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, so moving through, there were also, of course, later games.

01:21:16.675 --> 01:21:22.160
[SPEAKER_15]: There was all the way up through Mega Man X8, I think was the last one.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:28.588
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:34.542
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I meant.

01:21:35.803 --> 01:21:37.223
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, X8 was the last one.

01:21:37.363 --> 01:21:37.984
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to be sure.

01:21:38.024 --> 01:21:39.004
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was pretty sure.

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:43.366
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, we've also had different versions of them.

01:21:43.826 --> 01:21:57.752
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been Mega Man Extreme and Extreme 2, which in Japan was called Rockman X Cyber Mission and Rockman X2 Soul Eraser, which is just a freaking cool name.

01:21:58.512 --> 01:22:03.214
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also had Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, which was the re-release for PSP.

01:22:05.609 --> 01:22:13.813
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, basically, he's got different abilities apart from just, you know, the shooting and, you know, you kill the robot, you get the power, blah, blah, blah.

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:17.715
[SPEAKER_15]: He can also dash, and you can get an air dash later on.

01:22:18.356 --> 01:22:21.297
[SPEAKER_15]: You get all these power-ups.

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:24.899
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also charge your weapon, too, which is really useful.

01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:32.003
[SPEAKER_15]: That means you can also charge the weapons that you inherit from other Mavericks, so that's pretty cool.

01:22:33.002 --> 01:22:37.943
[SPEAKER_15]: and they have interesting names, some of these Mavericks, like Toxic Seahorse.

01:22:39.764 --> 01:22:48.206
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're pretty much element-based, you know, you get your fire, water, lightning, wind, magnetism, time, all kinds of stuff.

01:22:48.866 --> 01:22:55.608
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, really there's not much else, you know, I can really say about that because it's freakin' Mega Man X and if you haven't played it, where have you been?

01:22:56.368 --> 01:22:56.888
[SPEAKER_15]: Go play it!

01:22:57.608 --> 01:22:59.869
[SPEAKER_15]: There's billions and billions of versions out there to try.

01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:02.811
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from our chatroom at chat.org.com.

01:23:02.831 --> 01:23:05.733
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun says, actually, I played this game on PC first.

01:23:06.113 --> 01:23:09.975
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a PC demo that was just the intro stage until Sigma showed up, but I thought it was awesome.

01:23:10.195 --> 01:23:11.676
[SPEAKER_08]: I do remember this game on PC, actually.

01:23:12.177 --> 01:23:13.077
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a PC port.

01:23:13.378 --> 01:23:16.199
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an old-ass Mega Man game on PC that was really terrible.

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.400
[SPEAKER_08]: It was only like three stages.

01:23:18.241 --> 01:23:21.303
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, but that's not X. But anyway, let's see.

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:27.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I got schooled because I said earlier, remember I said back when we didn't have 3D games and all that?

01:23:27.947 --> 01:23:30.189
[SPEAKER_08]: ActDev said we had 3D Rad Racer.

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:32.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I got burned.

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:33.631
[SPEAKER_08]: You did.

01:23:33.671 --> 01:23:34.011
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

01:23:34.472 --> 01:23:37.373
[SPEAKER_15]: The shutter glasses that came out with the Master System.

01:23:37.393 --> 01:23:38.014
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was red-blue.

01:23:38.094 --> 01:23:38.314
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

01:23:38.374 --> 01:23:40.956
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but there was Zaxxon 3D.

01:23:41.696 --> 01:23:42.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

01:23:42.637 --> 01:23:43.477
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the shutter glasses.

01:23:43.637 --> 01:23:45.579
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so I guess we did have 3D gaming back then.

01:23:45.619 --> 01:23:46.099
[SPEAKER_08]: I got told.

01:23:46.359 --> 01:23:47.520
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, what are you doing?

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.021
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really in the Super Nintendo era.

01:23:49.421 --> 01:23:50.282
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you playing Saints Row?

01:23:50.302 --> 01:23:52.563
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is playing Saints Row with his dildo bat.

01:23:52.883 --> 01:23:54.625
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to hit somebody in the face with your dildo bat?

01:23:55.465 --> 01:23:55.785
[SPEAKER_08]: You just...

01:23:58.095 --> 01:24:00.497
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this is terrible radio if I watch this.

01:24:00.997 --> 01:24:01.337
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

01:24:01.617 --> 01:24:02.338
[SPEAKER_15]: It's floppy.

01:24:02.358 --> 01:24:04.779
[SPEAKER_15]: Who wants a floppy dildo?

01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:11.223
[SPEAKER_08]: He literally threw a guy to the ground and then posed like, hey, like a little swimsuit model pose on the guy.

01:24:11.984 --> 01:24:12.264
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

01:24:14.205 --> 01:24:16.026
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the purpose of having a floppy dildo?

01:24:16.286 --> 01:24:20.048
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kicked that fat guy in the crotch and then whapped him with your dildo.

01:24:20.068 --> 01:24:20.928
[SPEAKER_15]: They kicked a woman.

01:24:21.508 --> 01:24:21.829
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a woman.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:22.709
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a woman.

01:24:22.749 --> 01:24:23.429
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a pat.

01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:25.750
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a pat.

01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:26.611
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:24:27.331 --> 01:24:28.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, there it is.

01:24:28.792 --> 01:24:30.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week.

01:24:31.213 --> 01:24:34.134
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man X. Good pick, DarkSakura.

01:24:34.174 --> 01:24:34.514
[SPEAKER_08]: Good pick.

01:24:34.694 --> 01:24:35.095
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

01:24:35.215 --> 01:24:35.575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

01:24:35.715 --> 01:24:35.935
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:24:36.395 --> 01:24:38.337
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere.

01:24:38.817 --> 01:24:44.661
[SPEAKER_08]: Those of you on the podcast will only be gone like five seconds, but those of you live, don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:45.001 --> 01:24:55.849
[SPEAKER_08]: Your emails, which finally came through, phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, rapid fire news, talk of a Tumblr post that's taking everybody by storm, but I'm going to be a bitch about it.

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:57.250
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned for that.

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.210
[SPEAKER_08]: What's new?

01:24:58.491 --> 01:24:58.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

01:24:58.791 --> 01:24:59.351
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

01:25:00.552 --> 01:25:00.752
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

01:25:01.032 --> 01:25:03.994
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back in just a few more minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:04.035 --> 01:25:04.515
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go anywhere.

01:25:10.876 --> 01:25:13.638
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:13.718 --> 01:25:20.161
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live with the 435th episode of our show on this November the 13th of 2011.

01:25:20.802 --> 01:25:26.585
[SPEAKER_08]: And during the break there, I was watching Loki play a little bit of Saints Row the Third, which he has hooked up here in studio, which he's playing.

01:25:27.065 --> 01:25:28.886
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's just running around punching people in the face.

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:30.427
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is very purple.

01:25:30.707 --> 01:25:37.271
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know I was getting that in the art and everything, but, like, the game, the knights, the sky is all lit up purple and the paws is purple.

01:25:37.611 --> 01:25:38.132
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:25:53.021 --> 01:25:53.381
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

01:25:54.342 --> 01:25:54.662
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:25:54.702 --> 01:25:55.243
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you go.

01:25:55.303 --> 01:25:55.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row.

01:25:57.224 --> 01:25:57.844
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live.

01:25:57.884 --> 01:26:04.068
[SPEAKER_08]: You can join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and comment on some of the rapid-fire news we're about to get to.

01:26:04.128 --> 01:26:07.171
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, you got to pause Saints Row to go over some rapid-fire news.

01:26:07.471 --> 01:26:15.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and we'll talk a little bit more about Saints Row because Saints Row 4 has already been out by the guys over at THQ.

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row in Space

01:26:43.258 --> 01:26:44.379
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki just pointed at me.

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:44.759
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.521
[SPEAKER_06]: You think that's it?

01:26:46.661 --> 01:26:48.783
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

01:26:48.823 --> 01:26:51.085
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you said more over the top than this one.

01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:58.331
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like, how did the Friday the 13th series end up going, like, just too far over the top by sending Jason to space?

01:26:59.311 --> 01:27:01.173
[SPEAKER_08]: That is part of the DLC, actually.

01:27:01.233 --> 01:27:07.778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pimps in space, or, like, gangsters in space is literally the...

01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:11.209
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:44.110
[SPEAKER_06]: and kind of coincidentally also Atlas announced that they're going to be publishing Game of Thrones on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 coming out this March if I remember correctly.

01:27:46.711 --> 01:27:52.313
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, lots of stuff based on that property I guess because it is pretty good actually.

01:27:52.373 --> 01:27:53.173
[SPEAKER_08]: People like that show.

01:27:54.594 --> 01:28:01.216
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, last but not least, Dead Island is receiving a patch which will do a few things.

01:28:01.756 --> 01:28:05.517
[SPEAKER_06]: Also going to be raising the level cap to 60.

01:28:07.037 --> 01:28:13.378
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also included some new blueprints for weapon mods added.

01:28:14.258 --> 01:28:17.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Infected damage reduced and a bunch of other gameplay improvements.

01:28:17.799 --> 01:28:24.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Also some fixes to the interface and just improved stability and network performance and co-op and that kind of stuff.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Neat.

01:28:28.601 --> 01:28:31.823
[SPEAKER_08]: In our chatroom at chat.orange.com, we're a little bit buffered here.

01:28:31.863 --> 01:28:34.044
[SPEAKER_08]: So the chat is just now hearing the Saints Row story.

01:28:34.544 --> 01:28:38.166
[SPEAKER_08]: And Orange Wright in our chatroom says, pimps at sea?

01:28:40.307 --> 01:28:42.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there Saints Row on the ocean?

01:28:42.568 --> 01:28:45.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there pirates versus ninjas in Saints Row?

01:28:45.929 --> 01:28:48.251
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have pirates or ninjas.

01:28:49.171 --> 01:28:52.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know about pirates, but I know you can have ninjas in your gang.

01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:55.534
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, maybe that's somewhere they could go with it.

01:28:57.196 --> 01:28:59.424
[SPEAKER_06]: Gang Warfare on the high seas.

01:28:59.484 --> 01:29:01.090
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dress up like anything you want.

01:29:03.605 --> 01:29:05.606
[SPEAKER_08]: And GameGuru says, pimps in space?

01:29:05.706 --> 01:29:07.428
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I really need to get into Saints Row.

01:29:08.889 --> 01:29:09.129
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:13.593
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to... And THQ gives you no kickback, Loki, right?

01:29:13.633 --> 01:29:15.375
[SPEAKER_08]: You really are just that big a fanboy for Saints Row?

01:29:15.515 --> 01:29:16.276
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the game.

01:29:16.316 --> 01:29:16.816
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

01:29:16.976 --> 01:29:17.417
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

01:29:17.857 --> 01:29:18.137
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:29:18.758 --> 01:29:19.699
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this game, too.

01:29:19.799 --> 01:29:22.101
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIII, and it's getting a sequel.

01:29:22.181 --> 01:29:23.742
[SPEAKER_08]: XIII-2 is coming out.

01:29:24.063 --> 01:29:25.464
[SPEAKER_08]: As if there weren't enough games coming out.

01:29:25.484 --> 01:29:27.806
[SPEAKER_08]: But the good news is this one's not out until early, early next year.

01:29:28.106 --> 01:29:31.467
[SPEAKER_08]: There are going to be some special edition packages for the game.

01:29:31.507 --> 01:29:34.008
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm going to report on what's coming out in Europe.

01:29:34.348 --> 01:29:37.689
[SPEAKER_08]: However, apparently a lot of this is going to be coming to North America as well.

01:29:38.069 --> 01:29:52.834
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is going to be a collector's edition that will come with special packaging and a game, a composer soundtrack CD, an artwork book, six postcards featuring CG artwork of the characters, and a lenticular art print of Lightning, who isn't even the main character in the game, so go figure.

01:29:53.234 --> 01:30:04.658
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, I guess, a Crystal Edition that comes with all that, but instead of a single CD, you get a four-disc soundtrack, and you get a Final Fantasy XIII-2 t-shirt that you can't get anywhere else.

01:30:05.338 --> 01:30:07.799
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, I guess like a little presentation box.

01:30:08.259 --> 01:30:16.462
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the same pre-order stuff will be coming to America as well, because, hey, if you're going to spend $60 on a game, why not spend $80 and get a free t-shirt and soundtrack, huh?

01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:18.732
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

01:30:19.533 --> 01:30:19.713
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

01:30:19.733 --> 01:30:20.775
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to really love that, though.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:26.463
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some other Black Friday deals here that we wanted to mention real quick.

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:34.655
[SPEAKER_08]: At this part, there is some special bundles coming out, and one of them of note is a Zelda 3DS bundle.

01:30:35.035 --> 01:30:39.036
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be like a special edition, and a lot of these have been cited around the internet.

01:30:39.356 --> 01:30:41.917
[SPEAKER_08]: This is making its way to the US for $179.

01:30:42.557 --> 01:30:46.899
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a black system that comes with The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D.

01:30:47.279 --> 01:30:51.160
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also going to be a flare red that comes with Mario 3D Land.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.821
[SPEAKER_08]: That is both available at Walmart.

01:30:54.321 --> 01:30:57.262
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently GameStop is also going to have a similar system.

01:30:57.802 --> 01:31:01.244
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, they're not like special branded systems.

01:31:01.264 --> 01:31:04.407
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just the regular... Oh, I thought they had the Zelda artwork on it.

01:31:04.427 --> 01:31:05.847
[SPEAKER_06]: No, only in Europe.

01:31:06.148 --> 01:31:07.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo hiss.

01:31:08.389 --> 01:31:10.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, only plain Jane systems for us.

01:31:11.051 --> 01:31:12.992
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was reading about that, I thought it was special.

01:31:13.012 --> 01:31:13.873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you clarified.

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.515
[SPEAKER_08]: Some rumors about the next Xbox.

01:31:16.655 --> 01:31:23.419
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the prototype name is Loop, which is good that we have a different name for it now because it's not going to be Xbox 720.

01:31:23.759 --> 01:31:24.880
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would it be Xbox 720?

01:31:26.221 --> 01:31:27.262
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a huge assumption.

01:31:27.282 --> 01:31:28.042
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like Loop.

01:31:28.843 --> 01:31:32.485
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me think that now they're naming these after books in the Ring series.

01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:33.546
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

01:31:33.566 --> 01:31:38.689
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, hey, Xbox 360 had a bunch of rings as their logo, so why not have Loop as the next one?

01:31:39.089 --> 01:31:41.871
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I guess it's some type of inside blog.

01:31:41.891 --> 01:31:43.552
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, take it with a grain of salt, whatever.

01:31:44.613 --> 01:31:46.194
[SPEAKER_08]: Loop is the code name for it.

01:31:46.614 --> 01:31:52.358
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to have all this boosted technology called assistive cores inside.

01:31:53.439 --> 01:31:57.803
[SPEAKER_08]: including you know graphics, AI, physics, sound, networking, encryption, sensors.

01:31:58.324 --> 01:32:00.326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be smaller and cheaper than the 360.

01:32:00.767 --> 01:32:03.730
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that means when the 360 initially came out.

01:32:04.191 --> 01:32:06.714
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to run on a modified version of Windows 9.

01:32:07.795 --> 01:32:07.975
[SPEAKER_08]: That's

01:32:07.995 --> 01:32:09.796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not too surprising, really, all things considered.

01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:12.699
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, isn't the Xbox now starting to look more and more like Windows 8?

01:32:13.219 --> 01:32:14.620
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the prototypes are showing for that?

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:23.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's funny that it's running on Windows 9, and some of the rumors I've been hearing are like, it's going to be out either late next year or early next, you know, 2013.

01:32:23.688 --> 01:32:26.570
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, so they're going to go through 8 that fast?

01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:31.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if it's a modified Windows 9, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation there.

01:32:32.295 --> 01:32:32.735
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows?

01:32:33.395 --> 01:32:33.516
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

01:32:34.176 --> 01:32:34.637
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

01:32:34.977 --> 01:32:36.959
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have rumors galore.

01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:38.420
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't have anything solid until evening.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:48.069
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not surprised either because I think that they're going to be... Windows 8, one of the things about that is they're going to do a lot of compatibility with different ARM processors and stuff.

01:32:48.549 --> 01:32:54.795
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they're trying to make it so that can run on pretty much everything, that wouldn't surprise me.

01:32:54.855 --> 01:32:57.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does the chat room think I said Xbox 360 Lube?

01:32:57.858 --> 01:32:58.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I say Lube?

01:32:58.639 --> 01:32:59.499
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you said Loop.

01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:00.910
[SPEAKER_14]: I said Lube.

01:33:01.051 --> 01:33:01.971
[SPEAKER_14]: Lube would be a fun name.

01:33:02.031 --> 01:33:04.773
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why they're all like, did he say the Xbox Lube?

01:33:04.893 --> 01:33:06.775
[SPEAKER_14]: Then it would be a smooth move.

01:33:09.357 --> 01:33:11.218
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I kind of like the name Xbox Lube.

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:13.399
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting you ready.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:20.625
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be the... That'll be the... Bend over, here we come!

01:33:20.705 --> 01:33:21.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Bend over!

01:33:24.748 --> 01:33:25.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

01:33:25.248 --> 01:33:29.291
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, it's now... We are now officially calling the next Xbox the Xbox Lube.

01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:31.785
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling kind of nauseous now.

01:33:49.575 --> 01:33:53.158
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo says, I like Xbox Blue, but the Blu-ray will slide in better.

01:33:53.438 --> 01:33:56.360
[SPEAKER_15]: So how about some Dragon Quest X?

01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.302
[SPEAKER_15]: If you are in the Japanese beta, you get a free hat.

01:33:59.522 --> 01:34:00.903
[SPEAKER_15]: Notice I said the Japanese beta.

01:34:01.483 --> 01:34:04.385
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's only the beta in Japan.

01:34:04.425 --> 01:34:07.387
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to have a Japanese Square Enix account to be able to sign up for it.

01:34:07.467 --> 01:34:10.129
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're not in Japan, it sucks to be you.

01:34:11.429 --> 01:34:12.770
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it does suck anyway, but anyway.

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:15.191
[SPEAKER_15]: So how about some Bioshock Infinite?

01:34:15.351 --> 01:34:20.534
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to have a special move peripheral.

01:34:21.814 --> 01:34:29.118
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it says it will draw you deeper into this vision of a parallel future, blah, blah, blah.

01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:31.239
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't know what it is.

01:34:32.319 --> 01:34:33.120
[SPEAKER_15]: I bet it's a hose.

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they confirmed that that's not actually happening.

01:34:36.289 --> 01:34:36.449
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:34:36.749 --> 01:34:37.009
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:39.270
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Saints Row, the third.

01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:40.811
[SPEAKER_15]: How about that dildo that you were playing with?

01:34:41.651 --> 01:34:42.372
[SPEAKER_06]: It was floppy.

01:34:43.312 --> 01:34:48.154
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, for the Japanese version, the penetrator has been censored.

01:34:48.875 --> 01:34:52.836
[SPEAKER_15]: The veins and physics from the dildo was meant to be removed.

01:34:53.937 --> 01:34:57.238
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they have stricter guidelines on how you can display a phallus.

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:59.839
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they also took out the balls as well.

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.441
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not believe the testicles were on the penetrator.

01:35:06.217 --> 01:35:07.639
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very serious, Rob.

01:35:07.659 --> 01:35:08.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you laughing?

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.782
[SPEAKER_08]: They have effectively neutered the weapon.

01:35:13.425 --> 01:35:15.347
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a purple vibrator now.

01:35:15.367 --> 01:35:17.809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally going to throw everything off.

01:35:19.391 --> 01:35:25.337
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite is that all these very serious game blogs had to report, well, yes, they had to make the dildo less veiny.

01:35:26.963 --> 01:35:28.724
[SPEAKER_15]: You had to take out his floppy physics.

01:35:28.744 --> 01:35:30.825
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would be awesome to have?

01:35:31.905 --> 01:35:45.971
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave this out, and of course they can't do this out over here because it would be tasteless, but in certain other countries like Denmark and Finland or whatever, they were actually shipping them recreations of the Penetrator.

01:35:46.371 --> 01:35:48.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Actual size recreations of the Penetrator.

01:35:48.852 --> 01:35:51.513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a giant four foot long dildo on a stick.

01:35:52.988 --> 01:35:53.708
[SPEAKER_15]: On a baseball bat.

01:35:53.908 --> 01:35:57.290
[SPEAKER_06]: On a baseball bat that these blog people had.

01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:59.591
[SPEAKER_06]: I would display that proudly.

01:35:59.651 --> 01:36:00.771
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for pictures.

01:36:02.272 --> 01:36:03.192
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Kotaku.

01:36:03.772 --> 01:36:04.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Kotaku has them.

01:36:05.433 --> 01:36:08.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, because she's got to post them in the Orange Launch Radio Tumblr account.

01:36:08.294 --> 01:36:10.115
[SPEAKER_08]: So we haven't really been posting a lot over there tonight.

01:36:10.195 --> 01:36:11.215
[SPEAKER_08]: So here you go.

01:36:12.396 --> 01:36:12.736
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:18.718
[SPEAKER_15]: They show what it looks like in Japan, and it's... Rigid.

01:36:19.398 --> 01:36:19.979
[SPEAKER_15]: Very rigid.

01:36:20.039 --> 01:36:20.619
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks painful.

01:36:23.303 --> 01:36:27.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on to talking about... This is actually from Tumblr.

01:36:27.384 --> 01:36:29.844
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to talk about this real quick before we get into some long-form news.

01:36:30.104 --> 01:36:33.845
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I saw this around Twitter, and this is a nice story.

01:36:34.125 --> 01:36:37.066
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to share this nice story with you guys and see what you guys think about it, okay?

01:36:37.806 --> 01:36:42.207
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I got to abridge this because I don't want to read this verbatim.

01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:44.267
[SPEAKER_08]: But where is this coming from?

01:36:44.287 --> 01:36:48.148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the original Tumblr user that posted this was iHeartChaos.

01:36:48.968 --> 01:36:49.849
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:13.867
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually had sold a bunch of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and did housework for his parents to get it.

01:37:14.647 --> 01:37:18.630
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy who wrote this said, I had an idea, save my place in line.

01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:25.334
[SPEAKER_08]: And he went through the line, told other people about the situation, collected a bunch of money, five bucks here and there and so forth.

01:37:25.754 --> 01:37:29.497
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was able to raise the money for a new copy, bought the kid a new copy.

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:32.339
[SPEAKER_08]: And the kid was very thankful about it and so forth.

01:37:32.359 --> 01:37:34.160
[SPEAKER_08]: And the kid said, do you need anything in return?

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.303
[SPEAKER_08]: and the guy says, I told him, young man, I just hope one day you'll do something equally nice for someone.

01:37:40.984 --> 01:37:44.506
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's a very inspiring, pay it forward type of story, right?

01:37:44.566 --> 01:37:45.867
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very, very nice.

01:37:48.227 --> 01:37:54.973
[SPEAKER_08]: I read this on Twitter and I was like, that's sweet, but I'm going to be a bitch here because there's something kind of really wrong with this story.

01:37:55.493 --> 01:37:56.634
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone else pick up on it?

01:37:56.934 --> 01:37:58.155
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I picked up on it.

01:37:58.215 --> 01:37:59.396
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you pick up on, Loki?

01:37:59.576 --> 01:38:03.500
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked up on the fact, first off, it's a child playing an M-rated game.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.520
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, Loki.

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:09.524
[SPEAKER_08]: I said at the very beginning, it was a 13-year-old who rolled his bike and sold his Yu-Gi-Oh cards to get the game.

01:38:09.544 --> 01:38:10.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a midnight launch?

01:38:10.665 --> 01:38:11.826
[SPEAKER_08]: At a midnight launch.

01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:13.348
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, his parents are wonderful.

01:38:14.308 --> 01:38:21.735
[SPEAKER_08]: If, now, this is going to sound really rude, but this is the point when you start to look at situations like that, do you go, is this story real?

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:23.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the story's not real.

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:32.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say, but I think I have a right to be skeptical, because what parent lets a 13-year-old ride their bike at midnight at night?

01:38:33.635 --> 01:38:37.080
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess there's some crazy people out there, but it does leave me positive.

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:41.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and see what happens when you do let your 13-year-old out at midnight.

01:38:41.887 --> 01:38:44.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, why are people robbing people of games?

01:38:45.873 --> 01:38:47.296
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that part's shitty.

01:38:47.376 --> 01:38:49.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Go steal it from a store or something.

01:38:49.719 --> 01:38:58.644
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, you know, and then there's that part and it makes me go, well, you know, that definitely could be legit that somebody's going to steal an Xbox game right out of a kid's hands.

01:38:58.704 --> 01:39:00.204
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really fucking classy.

01:39:00.525 --> 01:39:06.007
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, there's some people in this world that are just not have no class whatsoever and would do something like that.

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:13.731
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, there's also that part of me that's like, but it's a 13-year-old trying to buy an M-rated game.

01:39:14.131 --> 01:39:20.675
[SPEAKER_08]: The game starts, I don't mean to be all spoilery, but within the first five minutes of playing Skyrim, you're going to see some guy get his head chopped off.

01:39:21.515 --> 01:39:22.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:39:22.275 --> 01:39:23.756
[SPEAKER_08]: Old-style execution style.

01:39:24.156 --> 01:39:26.658
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, do you want your 13-year-old to see that?

01:39:27.358 --> 01:39:28.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not.

01:39:28.538 --> 01:39:30.259
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, some 13-year-olds can probably handle it.

01:39:30.279 --> 01:39:30.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.421
[SPEAKER_15]: I watched Red Sonja when I was, what, seven?

01:39:33.761 --> 01:39:35.002
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was your parents' choice.

01:39:36.082 --> 01:39:36.562
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it wasn't.

01:39:36.963 --> 01:39:43.167
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you didn't ride two miles in the dark at midnight to go do it.

01:39:43.287 --> 01:39:45.408
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the parents let the kid did this.

01:39:46.389 --> 01:39:49.451
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the parents let the kid did this, and that's fine, whatever, he's not my kid.

01:39:49.531 --> 01:39:56.916
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I go, but the store effectively allowed this perfect stranger to buy an M-rated game for a 13-year-old.

01:39:57.376 --> 01:40:00.879
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, regardless of the reason, isn't that not supposed to be happening?

01:40:01.819 --> 01:40:02.960
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not supposed to be happening.

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:03.060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:40:04.463 --> 01:40:09.749
[SPEAKER_08]: So, now my other question is, am I a bitch for my mind instantly going here?

01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:11.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me... Yes.

01:40:11.951 --> 01:40:15.255
[SPEAKER_08]: On a feel-good, warm, fuzzy-wuzzy, gamers-do-good story.

01:40:16.597 --> 01:40:21.762
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he didn't do good, because he basically bought the... He should have... I don't know, whatever.

01:40:21.802 --> 01:40:23.364
[SPEAKER_06]: His parents should have taken care of it.

01:40:25.327 --> 01:40:27.069
[SPEAKER_08]: So, alright.

01:40:27.129 --> 01:40:29.192
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it wrong that I'm color correcting this picture of a dildo?

01:40:30.433 --> 01:40:31.294
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just really bored.

01:40:31.614 --> 01:40:33.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, wait a minute, you're doing a show, how can you be bored?

01:40:33.997 --> 01:40:34.257
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:40:34.698 --> 01:40:40.224
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm... Moving on, let's get to some more gaming news, Loki.

01:40:40.825 --> 01:40:43.608
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, you know, one of the things that...

01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:46.993
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:41:04.355 --> 01:41:06.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Say I didn't want to play online.

01:41:06.356 --> 01:41:08.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Say I bought the game because it has System Link.

01:41:09.338 --> 01:41:10.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Praise System Link.

01:41:10.598 --> 01:41:10.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:41:11.959 --> 01:41:15.661
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to play with my friend over System Link.

01:41:15.881 --> 01:41:18.022
[SPEAKER_06]: In order for me to do that, I have to put in an online pass code.

01:41:18.122 --> 01:41:18.462
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

01:41:19.183 --> 01:41:26.767
[SPEAKER_06]: If I bought this game used and I had no intention to play it online at all, I wanted to play it System Link, I would have to pay $10 to get a code.

01:41:27.527 --> 01:41:28.948
[SPEAKER_06]: An online pass to play offline!

01:41:30.876 --> 01:41:31.657
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up with that?

01:41:32.238 --> 01:41:33.419
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, that is the case.

01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:37.744
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a screenshot of the actual online passcode.

01:41:37.924 --> 01:41:39.326
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my own online passcode.

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.349
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you can't do it.

01:41:42.469 --> 01:41:47.575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and of course, because the copy is early, it's not actually on the site yet.

01:41:47.775 --> 01:41:50.458
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't actually play co-op with anybody yet.

01:41:51.519 --> 01:41:52.600
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's fucked up.

01:41:53.841 --> 01:42:01.546
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I thought the whole point of these online passes... And it's not even me calling it an online pass.

01:42:01.606 --> 01:42:04.609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, you know, okay, this is an Ubi Uplay thing.

01:42:04.649 --> 01:42:06.530
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to unlock bonus contents.

01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:09.032
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, your online pass code.

01:42:10.233 --> 01:42:17.138
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm not playing this online, and the whole reason that you're charging this is because online servers cost money to run, then...

01:42:18.993 --> 01:42:21.054
[SPEAKER_06]: Then basically you're just taking money for the hell of it.

01:42:21.934 --> 01:42:24.194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:42:24.475 --> 01:42:26.515
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you should have had System Link outside of it.

01:42:26.615 --> 01:42:28.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's why they don't have System Link outside of it.

01:42:28.836 --> 01:42:30.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they know this game is going to get pirated.

01:42:30.396 --> 01:42:36.718
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also know that there are ways that you can play online co-op with somebody else via System Link.

01:42:38.038 --> 01:43:04.209
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's why they put this behind a code because if they're going to at least make some money off this pirated copy if you're going to play online and play co-op whether it be through System Link or whatever then they're going to make $10 off it that's the true reason why it's like this but still for legitimate people that want to play this game say buy it used or whatever in other words it's a further case of legitimate buyers getting screwed over anti-piracy measures that will get hacked to shit anyway

01:43:04.329 --> 01:43:07.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, because I agree this game's awesome and you should buy it.

01:43:08.111 --> 01:43:12.173
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, if you can buy it new, great, because I think you should play it sooner than later.

01:43:12.273 --> 01:43:20.376
[SPEAKER_06]: But not everyone can buy it new and you shouldn't be expected to have to pony out, you know, money for something that maybe you're not sure that you'd like it or something.

01:43:20.396 --> 01:43:27.160
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, granted, but when you do buy the game new, you don't, I mean, we have to remember that online passes don't affect those that buy new.

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:27.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:56.323
[SPEAKER_06]: but it still it still ain't well and actually no it does kind of affect me if buying a new because I play on a lot of different systems at work so if I want to play System Link Co-op now I can only play on my system and you know I'd have to get another copy new you can't like download the data to USB and then go to a friend's house and put the USB in there no I don't think so I think it's tied to your system it might be tied to your account you might be able to do it

01:43:56.923 --> 01:44:04.650
[SPEAKER_06]: But even still, though, I would have to log in online anyways to play System Link, you know, because you have to download its DLC, basically.

01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:07.032
[SPEAKER_08]: So DLC is usually tied to your system.

01:44:07.172 --> 01:44:07.412
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

01:44:08.913 --> 01:44:12.036
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't play the same account on two systems to System Link, can you?

01:44:12.517 --> 01:44:13.257
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:44:13.337 --> 01:44:14.078
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the trick.

01:44:14.698 --> 01:44:17.281
[SPEAKER_08]: So you are kind of getting screwed in that regard.

01:44:18.642 --> 01:44:18.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

01:44:20.932 --> 01:44:29.158
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a good thing to know before the game comes out, I think, especially for people who might be considering buying it, waiting to get it used or whatever.

01:44:29.198 --> 01:44:30.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing, though.

01:44:30.439 --> 01:44:32.461
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't tell anybody it was going to have this.

01:44:33.582 --> 01:44:38.466
[SPEAKER_06]: It just happened to be a reviewer or whatever said, hey, it has an online pass.

01:44:38.546 --> 01:44:39.427
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something to report on.

01:44:39.747 --> 01:44:41.188
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't tell anybody.

01:44:41.288 --> 01:44:43.170
[SPEAKER_06]: If that reviewer hadn't said anything...

01:44:44.262 --> 01:44:50.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure obviously it's going to get out there early and people would say something, but let's just say, devil's advocate here, that no one said anything.

01:44:50.846 --> 01:44:52.106
[SPEAKER_06]: THQ would have not said anything.

01:44:52.346 --> 01:44:55.728
[SPEAKER_06]: You would get home with your copy of the game and you're like, what the fuck is this?

01:44:57.269 --> 01:44:58.429
[SPEAKER_06]: And they already have your 60 bucks.

01:44:58.449 --> 01:45:01.231
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you're getting used to seeing those things in every game.

01:45:03.494 --> 01:45:20.022
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with games that if they want to charge that because they're saying we need to fund our servers or whatever the case may be and it's an online game I have a problem with it on Xbox 360 I'm already paying $50 a month for that

01:45:21.658 --> 01:45:23.899
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are Microsoft games allowed to charge for this?

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:28.962
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, granted, Microsoft first-party games haven't done it because they know better.

01:45:31.043 --> 01:45:36.546
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go ape shit on them when they try to pull that shit because that's true double-dipping right there.

01:45:37.086 --> 01:45:40.188
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, it's really only the third parties that are doing it.

01:45:40.228 --> 01:45:41.429
[SPEAKER_08]: And now Sony, but Sony...

01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:59.566
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony's online thing is free already I give this way more justification on the Playstation than I do on the Xbox because I'm already paying $50 a month to play online on the Xbox that's kind of what pisses me off about the online pass in that regard but anyhow

01:46:01.668 --> 01:46:03.950
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumors abound that a new Zelda game is on its way.

01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:06.692
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being made for the 3DS.

01:46:06.832 --> 01:46:13.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Series producer Eiji Onuma talked to a Portuguese website, MyGames, and said the following, quote,

01:46:22.483 --> 01:46:26.804
[SPEAKER_08]: We are talking about a new game, but it takes much of what has been done on previous handhelds.

01:46:27.224 --> 01:46:30.425
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks are saying, is this sort of Majora's Mask?

01:46:30.865 --> 01:46:32.165
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually thinking no.

01:46:32.325 --> 01:46:38.807
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, I'm kind of reading really a lot into this, but I think it's definitely a new Zelda title, which kind of seems like a duh.

01:46:38.827 --> 01:46:40.487
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be the major Nintendo franchises.

01:46:40.847 --> 01:46:43.128
[SPEAKER_08]: But look at everything that's kind of been leading up to this.

01:46:43.168 --> 01:46:51.730
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Nintendo has been talking about, yeah, we need more big releases on the 3DS, and we have some things that are coming in 2012 that we're not ready to announce yet.

01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:57.596
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Zelda 3DS is probably the big thing that's being unveiled next E3 on the 3DS.

01:46:58.697 --> 01:46:59.618
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, duh, right?

01:47:02.581 --> 01:47:07.587
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna be some big first-party game, and if they're gonna refuse to give me F-Zero another year...

01:47:09.368 --> 01:47:24.881
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it's going to be probably Zelda Most likely This doesn't surprise me at all And I don't want it to be Majora's Mask I get that some people want that remade too, whatever, fine But I think I'd rather just have a new Zelda game Why not a new experience?

01:47:27.082 --> 01:47:33.588
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mario game's apparently pretty good So they're capable of taking the old franchises and making them fun in 3D Why not Zelda?

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:37.291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it'll be a new game It'll be cool

01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:40.151
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it won't take five years to develop.

01:47:40.772 --> 01:47:41.292
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see though.

01:47:42.092 --> 01:47:42.973
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the mailbag.

01:47:43.994 --> 01:47:55.581
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag and pick out the one email that came in this week that's worth reading.

01:47:55.841 --> 01:47:56.802
[SPEAKER_08]: All the rest of it is spam.

01:47:58.283 --> 01:48:05.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeDanceRadio.com I realize a lot of you have been busy playing Modern Warfare and Skyrim and Mario and so forth, but let's make her work next week.

01:48:06.465 --> 01:48:09.226
[SPEAKER_08]: No opinions on the panel tonight about Modern Warfare.

01:48:09.366 --> 01:48:10.747
[SPEAKER_08]: I need emails on Modern Warfare.

01:48:11.367 --> 01:48:14.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me why this sold 9 million copies or whatever the first day.

01:48:14.508 --> 01:48:15.248
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to understand.

01:48:15.848 --> 01:48:19.369
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not hating on the game, I just want to know... I'm not hating on it.

01:48:19.629 --> 01:48:20.190
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my...

01:48:22.526 --> 01:48:25.108
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know why other people get so riled up about it.

01:48:51.049 --> 01:48:53.390
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks guys, Sundays are orange forever, Jim Sally

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.964
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the best holiday deal I ever got was my HDTV for $600.

01:49:16.024 --> 01:49:18.066
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind this was in the year, I think, 2004.

01:49:19.447 --> 01:49:20.328
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it at Costco.

01:49:20.428 --> 01:49:22.550
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was back when HDTVs were not flat.

01:49:23.351 --> 01:49:25.953
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the giant backs like the old school TVs still.

01:49:26.053 --> 01:49:27.594
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing was heavy as hell.

01:49:28.515 --> 01:49:29.917
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a big TV.

01:49:30.057 --> 01:49:35.202
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I get that when I was living with you, Loki, or was that when I was living with Extifer that I finally got that?

01:49:36.516 --> 01:49:40.538
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was only $600, which then was like dirt cheap for an HDTV.

01:49:40.578 --> 01:49:42.799
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you remember that TV, DarkSakura.

01:49:43.079 --> 01:49:44.680
[SPEAKER_08]: You know where you can see that TV?

01:49:46.481 --> 01:49:51.204
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the news report that Channel 3 did on us that somebody put up on YouTube.

01:49:52.124 --> 01:49:54.225
[SPEAKER_08]: You're playing DDR on that old TV.

01:49:54.245 --> 01:49:54.586
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see.

01:49:54.786 --> 01:49:55.226
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:49:57.711 --> 01:49:59.152
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a good time to revisit that music too.

01:49:59.172 --> 01:50:02.154
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I was playing DVR on... You were playing on the cabinet.

01:50:02.495 --> 01:50:03.115
[SPEAKER_08]: On the cabinet.

01:50:03.435 --> 01:50:04.316
[SPEAKER_15]: You were playing on the cabinet.

01:50:04.796 --> 01:50:05.177
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

01:50:05.217 --> 01:50:06.558
[SPEAKER_08]: That was when the B did the article.

01:50:06.598 --> 01:50:12.883
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the Sacramento B. Well, the one with the rock band, not rock band, but guitar hero was here at my house.

01:50:13.283 --> 01:50:13.643
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

01:50:13.823 --> 01:50:15.965
[SPEAKER_06]: He's talking about the... On my old TV.

01:50:16.125 --> 01:50:20.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you remember the It's So Much Fun story?

01:50:20.348 --> 01:50:21.649
[SPEAKER_06]: It's So Much Fun.

01:50:21.689 --> 01:50:22.890
[SPEAKER_08]: That led to that whole thing.

01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:23.611
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you remember that?

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.420
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look, I found it.

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.021
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it.

01:50:27.101 --> 01:50:27.921
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still on YouTube.

01:50:27.941 --> 01:50:28.761
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this.

01:50:28.781 --> 01:50:32.402
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor is one of the many people joining the podcasting craze.

01:50:32.482 --> 01:50:35.163
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming a web craze, but what is it?

01:50:35.303 --> 01:50:35.863
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it work?

01:50:35.943 --> 01:50:43.506
[SPEAKER_00]: KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share their thoughts with the world.

01:50:46.648 --> 01:50:53.572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game There, there's the ginormous TV, remember that guy?

01:50:53.712 --> 01:51:12.161
[SPEAKER_08]: I got that for 600 bucks, I was a steal back then October 9th, 2006, but anyway, now that I have this up I was thinking of the Vega, but the Vega was, um, dude's TV Now that we're, this is a five year old clip now, now I want to watch the rest No, I don't want to watch it It started off tiny and it's grown

01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:16.071
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what she said.

01:51:18.553 --> 01:51:19.593
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we're not playing this.

01:51:19.914 --> 01:51:21.415
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I gotta hear that again.

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:24.157
[SPEAKER_12]: It started off tiny and it's grown.

01:51:25.157 --> 01:51:26.899
[SPEAKER_04]: A subculture of pop culture.

01:51:27.239 --> 01:51:30.542
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming fans.

01:51:30.562 --> 01:51:31.462
[SPEAKER_04]: A cliche thing.

01:51:31.502 --> 01:51:32.683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cliche thing.

01:51:32.703 --> 01:51:34.665
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

01:51:36.101 --> 01:51:45.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to another... Remember that ginormous green chair we had randomly in the old studio in the Extifer apartment?

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:46.965
[SPEAKER_15]: The one I would sleep in sometimes?

01:51:46.985 --> 01:51:48.586
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, that chair is gigantic.

01:51:48.626 --> 01:51:49.006
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

01:51:49.046 --> 01:51:50.687
[SPEAKER_04]: ...episode of our podcast.

01:51:51.067 --> 01:51:54.829
[SPEAKER_04]: From their apartment in Rancho Cordova, using revolutionary technology...

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:56.330
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:58.252
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my old laptop that's in the garage now.

01:51:58.452 --> 01:52:00.134
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how young we are in this picture.

01:52:00.314 --> 01:52:01.296
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially look at Loki.

01:52:01.936 --> 01:52:03.478
[SPEAKER_08]: He looks so much younger in this clip.

01:52:03.919 --> 01:52:04.599
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had hair.

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:05.541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.

01:52:05.581 --> 01:52:06.241
[SPEAKER_08]: I look the same.

01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:07.363
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll do that to you.

01:52:07.803 --> 01:52:08.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Except your hair is shorter.

01:52:09.025 --> 01:52:10.226
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a different color.

01:52:12.128 --> 01:52:17.933
[SPEAKER_15]: basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really want to know.

01:52:18.353 --> 01:52:24.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Using a computer, podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:33.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Now anyone can create, edit, and air their ideas, concerns, music, and all things audio to anyone else willing to download it.

01:52:33.767 --> 01:52:34.988
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something they can take with them.

01:52:35.368 --> 01:52:38.631
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.

01:52:39.141 --> 01:52:43.907
[SPEAKER_04]: With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.

01:52:44.147 --> 01:52:47.992
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that they just interviewed some random dude bro, like who had his iPod with him.

01:52:48.072 --> 01:52:49.413
[SPEAKER_08]: He's skating down the street.

01:52:49.454 --> 01:52:54.980
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people can talk about things they like to talk about and other people can join in and listen to.

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.142
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really open and...

01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.831
[SPEAKER_04]: A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free.

01:53:02.031 --> 01:53:05.893
[SPEAKER_04]: The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes.

01:53:06.653 --> 01:53:13.696
[SPEAKER_04]: You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature, and a list of available podcasts are at your fingertips.

01:53:14.096 --> 01:53:17.918
[SPEAKER_04]: Free for you, free for the producers, free speech for everyone.

01:53:18.538 --> 01:53:19.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so much fun.

01:53:19.738 --> 01:53:20.259
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

01:53:20.319 --> 01:53:22.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they can go eat a dick, okay?

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:37.149
[SPEAKER_08]: interview me for a minute and a half let's play this two second clip they never show Loki's name, his real name they never show anything but that one little clip, oh it's so much fun and then me talking about something a little more profound

01:53:38.117 --> 01:53:39.038
[SPEAKER_04]: Free for the producers.

01:53:39.398 --> 01:53:40.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Free speech for everyone.

01:53:41.839 --> 01:53:42.520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much fun.

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:49.224
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.

01:53:49.304 --> 01:53:51.026
[SPEAKER_07]: So podcasting is just wonderful.

01:53:51.666 --> 01:53:54.988
[SPEAKER_07]: Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 Reports.

01:53:55.729 --> 01:53:57.290
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say more than everybody.

01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:58.290
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of cool.

01:53:58.330 --> 01:54:01.793
[SPEAKER_00]: ...began providing his weekly radio address as a podcast.

01:54:02.093 --> 01:54:07.537
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be downloaded so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're pumping iron.

01:54:08.758 --> 01:54:12.120
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, we were mentioned in the same breath as Governor Schwarzenegger.

01:54:12.161 --> 01:54:14.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, he really was the governor of California, if you weren't aware.

01:54:14.503 --> 01:54:16.124
[SPEAKER_08]: He really, really was the governor.

01:54:16.344 --> 01:54:18.986
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you notice that overhead cam shot trying to get my boobs?

01:54:20.628 --> 01:54:21.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously!

01:54:21.288 --> 01:54:22.429
[SPEAKER_08]: That cameraman fancied you.

01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:24.591
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever, it's just because I'm a girl.

01:54:25.972 --> 01:54:30.496
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, here's my favorite thing about that whole story.

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:32.278
[SPEAKER_08]: Our show is never named.

01:54:34.301 --> 01:54:37.425
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to have free advertising.

01:54:37.765 --> 01:54:41.889
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you watch him search, he's searching for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:41.929 --> 01:54:43.151
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the shout out we got.

01:54:43.751 --> 01:54:47.015
[SPEAKER_08]: But never did they say, these three guys produce a show called Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:47.375 --> 01:54:50.159
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, they play DDR and it's so much fun.

01:54:50.619 --> 01:54:52.982
[SPEAKER_08]: It started off tiny and it's grown.

01:54:55.970 --> 01:55:10.863
[SPEAKER_08]: Cutting Edge Technology These failed things called computers These guys are doing what Governor Schwarzenegger's doing Pumping iron Doing drugs Making poor decisions

01:55:15.126 --> 01:55:16.327
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on.

01:55:16.927 --> 01:55:17.788
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for emails?

01:55:18.708 --> 01:55:19.809
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, holiday deals.

01:55:19.949 --> 01:55:24.252
[SPEAKER_08]: We took a trip down memory lane and just totally ignored Jim Sally's question.

01:55:24.272 --> 01:55:24.872
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no more emails.

01:55:24.893 --> 01:55:25.933
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mentioned the TV.

01:55:26.313 --> 01:55:28.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anybody else get any really good holiday deals that they can remember?

01:55:28.755 --> 01:55:29.415
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember.

01:55:29.435 --> 01:55:29.776
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

01:55:30.736 --> 01:55:44.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I used to buy like, uh, different like media and stuff, you know, like CD blanks and stuff like that because you usually have, uh, some good deals on those at least during the holidays.

01:55:44.206 --> 01:55:47.068
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only thing I could see you like going to like Best Buy or something for.

01:55:49.139 --> 01:55:49.479
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:54.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us some emails in the future.

01:55:54.621 --> 01:55:54.901
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:55:54.961 --> 01:55:59.043
[SPEAKER_08]: After that trip down memory lane, I'm sure that's going to ignite some fury amongst some people.

01:55:59.483 --> 01:56:01.264
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a part of the show we call the FUs of the Week.

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:22.401
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:56:23.043 --> 01:56:24.306
[SPEAKER_15]: It gets us to feeling crappy.

01:56:25.563 --> 01:56:27.145
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, F you to Feeling Crappy.

01:56:27.545 --> 01:56:28.466
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to Shane.

01:56:30.308 --> 01:56:31.409
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is he getting an F you?

01:56:31.469 --> 01:56:39.557
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've listened to a lot of Manson, and every time, I can't help it, he's got me liking a group that I can't get any new stuff from anymore.

01:56:40.397 --> 01:56:42.419
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, didn't they break up years ago?

01:56:42.439 --> 01:56:45.322
[SPEAKER_15]: Years ago, but I just recently heard of them thanks to him.

01:56:45.342 --> 01:56:46.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't someone from that group die too?

01:56:46.884 --> 01:56:49.146
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, but I'm mad at Shane.

01:56:50.687 --> 01:56:51.608
[SPEAKER_15]: Only marginally.

01:56:51.708 --> 01:56:54.730
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also mad at Shane for not catching up on Supernatural.

01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:57.351
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can't talk to him about it.

01:56:57.891 --> 01:56:58.192
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

01:56:58.532 --> 01:57:03.114
[SPEAKER_08]: I love our chat room because we were talking about the similarities between Orange Launch Radio and Governor Schwarzenegger, right?

01:57:03.815 --> 01:57:06.857
[SPEAKER_08]: Kasson in the chat says, which one of the OLR hosts diddled the maid?

01:57:07.937 --> 01:57:13.758
[SPEAKER_08]: and SalaciousPop follows that up saying, is OLR going to suddenly reveal a 10-year-old offspring from a Latina domestic servant?

01:57:14.018 --> 01:57:15.779
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's something Governor Schwarzenegger did.

01:57:16.039 --> 01:57:17.119
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is the right age.

01:57:17.499 --> 01:57:19.380
[SPEAKER_08]: We got really drunk after our second episode.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.460
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ask how this happened.

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:25.161
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, physically capable of that, so shut up.

01:57:25.621 --> 01:57:27.481
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Loki or I could have boinked a maid.

01:57:28.582 --> 01:57:31.722
[SPEAKER_15]: But, oh, that's right, I'm not a Latina maid.

01:57:32.743 --> 01:57:34.243
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely are not a Latina maid.

01:57:36.487 --> 01:57:37.667
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, FUs of the week.

01:57:38.027 --> 01:57:39.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

01:57:39.728 --> 01:57:48.671
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say my FU goes to those people I'm not sure if you've seen these but they have these little signs that show how fast you're going and stuff like that.

01:57:49.191 --> 01:57:52.673
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a reminder to do the speed limit or under the speed limit.

01:57:52.733 --> 01:57:55.354
[SPEAKER_07]: I always, always speed up when I see those.

01:57:55.994 --> 01:57:59.517
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I see people, like, see those signs and they, like, slam on their brakes.

01:57:59.597 --> 01:58:01.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude, it's a fucking sign.

01:58:01.958 --> 01:58:03.219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna write you a ticket.

01:58:03.359 --> 01:58:04.180
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sign.

01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:07.402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it does, is it shows you how fast you're going.

01:58:07.702 --> 01:58:09.303
[SPEAKER_06]: And not accurately, by the way.

01:58:09.704 --> 01:58:15.308
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite thing to find out with those signs is how high it will track you before it starts getting angry and starts blinking.

01:58:16.128 --> 01:58:19.911
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I always like to see, like, what's the speed limit where it starts flashing slow down, asshole?

01:58:20.805 --> 01:58:26.851
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so I feed those people that think signs are real, people that are gonna, you know, write them tickets or something.

01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:28.192
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have a magical camera on it.

01:58:28.212 --> 01:58:30.394
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure someday the signs will be able to write you a ticket.

01:58:31.915 --> 01:58:33.377
[SPEAKER_08]: Governments are hard up enough for the money.

01:58:33.937 --> 01:58:34.257
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

01:58:34.898 --> 01:58:38.221
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the headache I had today.

01:58:39.182 --> 01:58:44.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Because headaches are terrible, and, yeah, it made me want to nap all day, forever.

01:58:45.544 --> 01:58:46.505
[SPEAKER_15]: Make you feel better, Rob?

01:58:46.685 --> 01:58:48.166
[SPEAKER_08]: What, the giant purple dildo?

01:58:48.406 --> 01:58:48.666
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:58:49.787 --> 01:58:50.968
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not make me feel better.

01:58:52.889 --> 01:58:53.629
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of want one.

01:58:55.331 --> 01:58:56.511
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd hang it up in the studio.

01:58:56.792 --> 01:58:57.172
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

01:58:57.632 --> 01:58:58.052
[SPEAKER_08]: I would.

01:58:58.933 --> 01:58:59.273
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:58:59.774 --> 01:59:01.074
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more stories.

01:59:01.094 --> 01:59:03.176
[SPEAKER_08]: The Skype line coming up soon, but first, more news.

01:59:03.256 --> 01:59:03.536
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

01:59:03.696 --> 01:59:06.438
[SPEAKER_08]: Studio, sex dungeon, same difference.

01:59:07.719 --> 01:59:14.463
[SPEAKER_06]: So, apparently, you know, we were talking a little bit about online passes and stuff, and one of the things that the online passes,

01:59:15.484 --> 01:59:17.185
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want to call them that.

01:59:17.545 --> 01:59:23.089
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew is basically to deter used game sales.

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:31.815
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a report that's out that's saying that basically used and digital sales actually make up about 35% of total console spending.

01:59:32.135 --> 01:59:45.124
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's very, you know, it makes sense with a lot of the stuff nowadays available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace or the PlayStation Network or even the WiiWare stores and Steam and whatever.

01:59:46.005 --> 01:59:48.688
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not surprising that it would be about that much.

01:59:49.409 --> 01:59:56.778
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also saying that 23% of the console games purchased in the U.S.

01:59:57.379 --> 02:00:02.185
[SPEAKER_06]: are used, and slightly more than the European market where it's about 20%.

02:00:03.767 --> 02:00:24.916
[SPEAKER_06]: also digitally distributed titles rank lower in both regions I guess taking up 12% of console market in America and 9% in Europe and also I guess they're saying that the 12% that actually is approximately $960 million worth of content that's being purchased right there

02:00:27.078 --> 02:00:33.744
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're saying also 54% of American console owners are spending an average of $49 a year on console downloads.

02:00:38.007 --> 02:00:44.791
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, talking a little bit about PC, and you would kind of think that PC is going to be skewing more towards the digital side.

02:00:45.451 --> 02:00:46.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that is true.

02:00:46.512 --> 02:00:52.215
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying that 58% of all PC gaming dollars are spent digitally on games or DLC.

02:00:53.295 --> 02:00:54.876
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the way it's going in the PC market.

02:00:55.237 --> 02:00:57.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much in the console market.

02:00:57.378 --> 02:01:01.140
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not surprised because you see PC retail shelves really drying up.

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.321
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a surprise at all.

02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:04.262
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:01:29.753 --> 02:01:34.014
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually going to talk to people I know to take it apart and see about fixing the DVD player.

02:01:34.294 --> 02:01:35.095
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

02:01:35.475 --> 02:01:38.095
[SPEAKER_15]: And seeing what I can do to get Linux on it.

02:01:38.115 --> 02:01:39.636
[SPEAKER_15]: To make it do your evil bidding?

02:01:39.936 --> 02:01:48.058
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a version of Linux that's meant to run on a Mac and mirror Mac OS, only use a lot less memory and be a lot more efficient.

02:01:48.178 --> 02:01:49.578
[SPEAKER_08]: Then she's going to install the grid on it.

02:01:50.518 --> 02:01:50.838
[SPEAKER_08]: End of line.

02:01:50.858 --> 02:01:51.899
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'll move in.

02:01:52.759 --> 02:01:53.039
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:01:56.237 --> 02:02:22.904
[SPEAKER_06]: but anyhow only 35% you would think with all these online passes and everything it was much higher it doesn't seem so bad no because I think the majority of you know because you're looking at dollars and the majority of the stuff that's purchased online would be cheaper and also a lot more people are you know lining up to go to the stores to buy stuff and also not a lot of stuff is like day and date with you know games on you don't have it yet where you can buy

02:02:23.784 --> 02:02:32.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty at midnight as a digital download and I would be willing to bet if they did that you'd probably see a lot of people going that route.

02:02:32.610 --> 02:02:40.035
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Steam did launch Skyrim where you could preload the game and then you unencrypt it at midnight.

02:02:40.715 --> 02:02:43.477
[SPEAKER_08]: They did do that for Skyrim and I think they've done it for other big games too.

02:02:43.637 --> 02:02:49.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam does that a lot but I'm saying as far as console stuff goes you don't see that.

02:02:51.690 --> 02:02:53.213
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, you don't see consoles yet.

02:02:54.134 --> 02:02:55.276
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet.

02:02:55.616 --> 02:03:05.252
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for the Xbox Lube, because it's going to give the Lube, it's going to Lube up GameStop, because I bet a lot of these new consoles are going to go very, very heavy on digital distribution.

02:03:07.233 --> 02:03:08.173
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop can bend over.

02:03:08.814 --> 02:03:09.074
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:03:10.515 --> 02:03:11.055
[SPEAKER_08]: What, you all right?

02:03:12.015 --> 02:03:12.215
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

02:03:12.295 --> 02:03:13.916
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just listening to what Dan's playing.

02:03:14.116 --> 02:03:14.376
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:03:14.516 --> 02:03:15.117
[SPEAKER_08]: What is he playing?

02:03:15.597 --> 02:03:16.237
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row III.

02:03:16.517 --> 02:03:16.877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.

02:03:17.318 --> 02:03:17.558
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:03:18.898 --> 02:03:19.359
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

02:03:20.419 --> 02:03:24.121
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the biggest complaints about the Wii U when it was announced to E3 this year is what?

02:03:24.781 --> 02:03:32.745
[SPEAKER_08]: All the games will only work with the one controller, because I guess the system was not capable when they showed it at E3 of running games on multiple controllers.

02:03:32.765 --> 02:03:40.029
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know the touchscreens, the device is basically processing the screen and what you're seeing on the TV.

02:03:40.449 --> 02:03:43.890
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it was worrisome that you wouldn't be able to run multiple controllers.

02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:44.651
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, however...

02:03:45.311 --> 02:03:55.522
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, some stuff is going on behind the scenes where they might actually be retooling the Wii U to work with multiple of those consoles.

02:03:56.283 --> 02:04:06.473
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's an article on developonline.net that talks about Nintendo now knows they absolutely need to support two tablets.

02:04:07.134 --> 02:04:12.857
[SPEAKER_08]: At E3, they didn't commit to this, but they know how important it is to make technically feasible to support two screens.

02:04:13.357 --> 02:04:16.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if that affects frame rate, as a developer and player, I don't care.

02:04:16.699 --> 02:04:17.420
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to work.

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.061
[SPEAKER_08]: Developers will design appropriate games for this.

02:04:20.501 --> 02:04:23.923
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're building a quiz game, you're not going to give a shit about the frame rate.

02:04:24.684 --> 02:04:30.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, so apparently Nintendo is being pressured by developers to get this to work.

02:04:31.867 --> 02:04:33.388
[SPEAKER_08]: Could it end up delaying the whole system?

02:04:34.269 --> 02:04:34.589
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

02:04:35.498 --> 02:04:37.779
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you've already speculated the Wii U is not coming out next year.

02:04:38.779 --> 02:04:39.659
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be surprised.

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.740
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's 2013.

02:04:42.981 --> 02:04:47.222
[SPEAKER_08]: How is Nintendo going to... I mean, I was going to say, how is Nintendo going to recover next year?

02:04:47.382 --> 02:04:53.044
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're hearing reports that 3DS sales are going way up because of Mario 3D Land, at least over in Japan.

02:04:53.304 --> 02:04:54.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it'll help.

02:04:55.125 --> 02:04:59.607
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely what they're going to have next year will help.

02:04:59.687 --> 02:04:59.847
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

02:05:02.890 --> 02:05:07.535
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, that new system just sounds so broken right now.

02:05:07.936 --> 02:05:10.499
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have nothing to show for it yet.

02:05:10.839 --> 02:05:13.782
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some tech demos that are basically Wii games.

02:05:13.943 --> 02:05:15.104
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been six months.

02:05:15.364 --> 02:05:17.326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably a lot further along than what we saw at E3.

02:05:17.346 --> 02:05:18.808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a lot, lot

02:05:18.928 --> 02:05:20.829
[SPEAKER_08]: further, further along next E3.

02:05:21.090 --> 02:05:23.632
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think it's a done deal yet.

02:05:23.732 --> 02:05:28.936
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Nintendo knows that people were not as thrilled with Wii U as they were with the 3DS.

02:05:28.996 --> 02:05:33.119
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think come next E3, they're really prepared to just blow us away.

02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:45.628
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think some hardcore developers getting up on that stage, some third-party developers gonna get up there and show, you know, Saints Row 4 or something on the Wii U and how it's, you know, the technology is amazing or whatever.

02:05:46.268 --> 02:05:48.210
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously I'm just picking that because I know it'll

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:51.436
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll get you interested.

02:05:51.856 --> 02:05:52.137
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:05:53.057 --> 02:05:53.277
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:05:53.797 --> 02:05:53.977
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

02:05:54.658 --> 02:05:56.339
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you no way know-how buying a Wii U?

02:05:57.039 --> 02:06:00.841
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wouldn't say that, but I'm just saying I'm not... He's gonna steal one.

02:06:01.961 --> 02:06:02.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Steal one, please.

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:07.504
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not gonna... It's not something that right now I need to have.

02:06:08.764 --> 02:06:12.766
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru in our chatroom says, Yeah, the GameCube could support four GBAs.

02:06:13.187 --> 02:06:13.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Mmm...

02:06:14.167 --> 02:06:14.487
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

02:06:30.787 --> 02:06:34.068
[SPEAKER_08]: The box is streaming the image to your tablet.

02:06:34.168 --> 02:06:40.891
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have some processing power to those tablets, but they can't put a lot of processing power in there because they've got to keep the price down.

02:06:41.871 --> 02:06:49.514
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe that's something they might have to put more oomph in those tablets and make them more expensive.

02:06:49.634 --> 02:06:52.956
[SPEAKER_06]: What they should have done is they should delay this shit for another few years.

02:06:53.036 --> 02:06:55.917
[SPEAKER_06]: When the price of those components comes down, then you can do that.

02:06:56.477 --> 02:06:59.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but those tablets are essentially the lower half of a DS.

02:07:00.382 --> 02:07:01.703
[SPEAKER_08]: How expensive can those be now?

02:07:02.044 --> 02:07:03.225
[SPEAKER_08]: DSs are $79.

02:07:05.307 --> 02:07:07.910
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like the lowest-end DS is $79.

02:07:08.131 --> 02:07:10.053
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't tell me that technology is that expensive.

02:07:10.313 --> 02:07:12.035
[SPEAKER_08]: We're already expecting those tablets are going to be $100 a pop.

02:07:16.022 --> 02:07:37.468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know so all I know is I think it's a big old gimmick and I'm still not buying into it yet it's a fucking Wii with slightly better graphics and a goddamn tablet that's what's that tablet gonna do for me oh it's gonna stream some shit on it okay great you know this is shit that could have been on the screen oh but we're moving the inventory okay I why should I spend $100 on a tablet

02:07:39.569 --> 02:07:50.377
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, to be neat, you're going to put the inventory screen on this tablet instead of having push start to pop the inventory screen up.

02:07:50.637 --> 02:07:51.718
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who gives a shit?

02:07:51.738 --> 02:08:03.147
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to make our frame rate and stuff drop because we really need this inventory screen to not be... Once again, and this also goes to the Kinect too...

02:08:04.787 --> 02:08:06.529
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I just do things the old way?

02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:09.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I just push a button, inventory screen pops up?

02:08:09.911 --> 02:08:13.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I need the map always on the bottom of the screen?

02:08:13.154 --> 02:08:16.177
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want the map on the bottom of the screen, put it in the corner of the screen and be done with it.

02:08:16.557 --> 02:08:18.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I need the shout grenade to throw a grenade?

02:08:18.939 --> 02:08:19.559
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to.

02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:25.625
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I don't have to, but that's the thing though, is in these games, why do I have to waggle my controller to throw a grenade?

02:08:25.865 --> 02:08:26.886
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I just push a button?

02:08:27.106 --> 02:08:27.786
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid.

02:08:28.627 --> 02:08:46.342
[SPEAKER_08]: just because you can doesn't mean you should all they have to do is get up on that stage and say brand new F-Zero game coming to Wii U and I pre-ordered that's all they would have to do and you're part of the problem I am absolutely part of the problem but it's F-Zero, Loki it's the best GameCube game they had rah

02:08:46.974 --> 02:08:48.875
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to understand, Rob, those times are gone.

02:08:49.776 --> 02:08:52.818
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't give a shit about F-Zero anymore, and if they do, it's gonna suck.

02:08:52.838 --> 02:08:54.639
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you so mean, Loki?

02:08:55.559 --> 02:08:59.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Next thing you're gonna tell me the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus aren't real.

02:09:00.002 --> 02:09:00.603
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Rob?

02:09:00.943 --> 02:09:01.183
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

02:09:01.463 --> 02:09:01.783
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not.

02:09:04.778 --> 02:09:05.138
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

02:09:25.133 --> 02:09:32.817
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the virtual console release of Super Street Fighter 2 on Genesis in Japan has Wi-Fi.

02:09:33.517 --> 02:09:34.358
[SPEAKER_15]: So did Puyo Puyo.

02:09:35.298 --> 02:09:42.221
[SPEAKER_15]: But while we're getting the game, Street Fighter is not... No, yeah, it is.

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:45.843
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually going to have the Wi-Fi capability.

02:09:45.863 --> 02:09:47.164
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's kind of cool.

02:09:48.324 --> 02:09:49.084
[SPEAKER_15]: But why not Puyo Puyo?

02:09:50.526 --> 02:09:51.306
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not other stuff?

02:09:52.266 --> 02:09:54.407
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, unfortunately, Street Fighter is Street Fighter.

02:09:54.427 --> 02:09:59.028
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, not unfortunately, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter, and everybody likes Street Fighter.

02:09:59.568 --> 02:10:01.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Only some people have even heard of Puyo Puyo.

02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:03.209
[SPEAKER_08]: But Street Fighter 2 is huge.

02:10:03.769 --> 02:10:05.710
[SPEAKER_15]: We should be able to play people anywhere.

02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:13.312
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, yay for Virtual Console finally getting some online play capability about five years too late.

02:10:14.651 --> 02:10:16.253
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, did you hear about how they're doing this?

02:10:16.293 --> 02:10:20.217
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing it through emulation of that... Oh, God, I forgot the name of it.

02:10:20.257 --> 02:10:21.258
[SPEAKER_08]: The X-Mode?

02:10:22.039 --> 02:10:23.121
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck was that thing?

02:10:23.181 --> 02:10:24.602
[SPEAKER_08]: The X... No.

02:10:25.243 --> 02:10:25.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I forget.

02:10:26.184 --> 02:10:27.225
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat will yell it out.

02:10:27.265 --> 02:10:28.947
[SPEAKER_15]: That online Genesis thing, right?

02:10:29.027 --> 02:10:30.309
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not the Sega channel.

02:10:30.889 --> 02:10:34.333
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was Genesis and it was Super Nintendo.

02:10:34.974 --> 02:10:35.274
[SPEAKER_08]: An X...

02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:36.916
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

02:10:37.356 --> 02:10:44.161
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could plug it in, and it sat between your cartridge and the console, and you could dial into this network and play people.

02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:46.383
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like an old, old, old-ass version of Xbox Live.

02:10:46.403 --> 02:10:47.724
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what you're talking about.

02:10:47.804 --> 02:10:48.724
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that's the name of it.

02:10:49.225 --> 02:10:50.025
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stupid.

02:10:50.225 --> 02:10:51.667
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in Chow shot it.

02:10:51.707 --> 02:10:53.068
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to do any work.

02:10:53.088 --> 02:10:54.549
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just emulate this old shit.

02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:56.070
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they're doing to make it work.

02:10:56.410 --> 02:10:57.311
[SPEAKER_15]: It's too stupid.

02:10:59.012 --> 02:11:00.513
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to build an emulator.

02:11:01.094 --> 02:11:02.775
[SPEAKER_15]: If they can do it in Japan, why can't they do it here?

02:11:04.526 --> 02:11:26.840
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what they're doing in Japan is they're using that emulation to do it of course I'm believing everything I read on the internet so it might not actually be true but it wouldn't surprise me at all so just silly yeah X-Band thank you chatters who said that first X-Band Orange Wright said it first

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:31.641
[SPEAKER_08]: have you ever seen the X-Band?

02:11:33.023 --> 02:11:42.755
[SPEAKER_08]: I think only like 7,000 of them were ever sold here's a picture of it oh that's a tiny picture but that's all I got but you can kind of see how it like sits between the cartridge and the console plug it in

02:11:44.409 --> 02:11:45.229
[SPEAKER_08]: Expand, thank you.

02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:47.610
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, what do you got for us?

02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:50.851
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about Modern Warfare.

02:11:51.071 --> 02:11:52.731
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, we're saving the best for last, right?

02:11:53.692 --> 02:11:58.813
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Modern Warfare 3, of course, not surprisingly, broke all sorts of records.

02:11:59.473 --> 02:12:07.876
[SPEAKER_06]: It had the biggest launch ever for a game, and it sold 6.5 million units in one day.

02:12:08.536 --> 02:12:11.497
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's both in our total from US and UK.

02:12:11.517 --> 02:12:11.697
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:12:13.938 --> 02:12:21.353
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course they're saying that they were estimating 9 million units but

02:12:23.174 --> 02:12:24.334
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say give it a couple weeks.

02:12:26.455 --> 02:12:30.716
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, that puts the revenue for that game so far at $400 million.

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:40.738
[SPEAKER_06]: And the previous record, of course, was $310 million last year with Black Ops.

02:12:40.918 --> 02:12:45.500
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, or I'm sorry, with Modern Warfare 2 it was $310 million, Black Ops was $360 million.

02:12:47.597 --> 02:13:11.128
[SPEAKER_06]: so next year with whatever the fuck they come out with it'll be higher than that because people buy into this crap and not to say it's a bad game but it's a lot of people buying that game what draws everybody to this series popularity I think it's mob mentality friends

02:13:13.015 --> 02:13:14.516
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what draws people to World of Warcraft.

02:13:14.536 --> 02:13:15.156
[SPEAKER_08]: They are pretty.

02:13:15.356 --> 02:13:16.236
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen them.

02:13:16.296 --> 02:13:17.016
[SPEAKER_08]: Friends, you're right.

02:13:17.076 --> 02:13:18.297
[SPEAKER_08]: Social aspect, absolutely.

02:13:18.537 --> 02:13:20.658
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely that's something they built up this time.

02:13:21.178 --> 02:13:22.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's true.

02:13:23.699 --> 02:13:25.119
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, last story for you guys.

02:13:25.179 --> 02:13:26.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know what draws people to it.

02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:30.181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because of the fact that little kids get to play this game because their parents suck.

02:13:31.421 --> 02:13:32.142
[SPEAKER_06]: They let them go out.

02:13:32.222 --> 02:13:33.022
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's it.

02:13:33.462 --> 02:13:33.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

02:13:33.842 --> 02:13:35.523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would... How many...

02:13:36.563 --> 02:13:42.987
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do you want to bet that about 1 million of that 3.6 million sold is probably people under the age of 13?

02:13:44.688 --> 02:13:46.049
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about 13.

02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:48.110
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the age of 18, maybe.

02:13:49.631 --> 02:13:50.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely under the age of 18.

02:13:50.651 --> 02:13:52.493
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-year-olds and 16-year-olds, I believe it.

02:13:52.613 --> 02:13:54.474
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the age of 15.

02:13:55.354 --> 02:13:56.015
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee it.

02:13:57.015 --> 02:13:58.276
[SPEAKER_08]: 1 million at least.

02:13:59.537 --> 02:13:59.817
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:14:00.464 --> 02:14:01.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to one more story.

02:14:01.846 --> 02:14:03.688
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to get to Twitter topics.

02:14:03.768 --> 02:14:07.653
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:14:07.693 --> 02:14:09.676
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is about another series that's being worked on.

02:14:10.096 --> 02:14:16.164
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of a duh, but it's probably nice to hear that Gran Turismo 6, yep, it's underway.

02:14:16.224 --> 02:14:16.985
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being developed.

02:14:17.005 --> 02:14:17.826
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is!

02:14:18.046 --> 02:14:19.547
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come out for another eight years.

02:14:20.228 --> 02:14:22.930
[SPEAKER_08]: But isn't it nice to know that it's being worked on?

02:14:23.311 --> 02:14:28.315
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess this is coming from Kazunori Yamauchi, who's the creator of the Gran Turismo franchise.

02:14:28.615 --> 02:14:30.777
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the president of Polyphony Digital.

02:14:31.238 --> 02:14:37.003
[SPEAKER_08]: And he actually, I guess, was at the Specialty Equipment Market Association Industry Trade Show in Las Vegas.

02:14:37.023 --> 02:14:38.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Because where else do trade shows happen?

02:14:38.985 --> 02:14:41.987
[SPEAKER_08]: And was talking a lot about some of the recent developments to Gran Turismo 5.

02:14:42.688 --> 02:14:43.588
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

02:15:11.502 --> 02:15:12.402
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:15:34.947 --> 02:15:40.532
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row the Thirds dominate a lot of conversation tonight or maybe have something else that you think needs a shout out.

02:15:40.552 --> 02:15:43.415
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:45.897
[SPEAKER_08]: For everybody else, you probably want to use Skype.

02:15:46.077 --> 02:15:48.780
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:50.842
[SPEAKER_08]: Skype us, baby, Skype us.

02:15:51.062 --> 02:15:53.704
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, just tell us, oh, it's so much fun.

02:15:54.865 --> 02:15:57.608
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR, getting to some tweets tonight.

02:15:57.948 --> 02:15:59.690
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start off with a tweet from Redertainment.

02:16:00.612 --> 02:16:27.588
[SPEAKER_08]: Considering all the AAA games coming out in the next couple of weeks I'm wondering if there's a bank with good rates on credit cards No, there is not The answer to your question is no I guess my real answer, even though I get the tongue-in-cheekness of your question The real answer would be it depends on your credit score The all-important credit score is what's going to determine who's going to give you good rates Because if your credit score is really bad Then the only way you're going to get a credit card is what's called a secured credit card

02:16:27.908 --> 02:16:29.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, this is X-Link What's on your mind, buddy?

02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:56.755
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I just wanted to say Modern Warfare 3 was pretty decent.

02:16:56.815 --> 02:17:01.324
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm not really all into first-person shooters, but I actually loved playing it.

02:17:01.364 --> 02:17:04.831
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing with a roommate of mine, and we loved playing the co-op.

02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:05.632
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

02:17:06.161 --> 02:17:06.982
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you do in the game?

02:17:07.022 --> 02:17:10.145
[SPEAKER_08]: You just go through and shoot terrorists in the face?

02:17:10.185 --> 02:17:17.251
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, there's a co-op called, it's like a mission type mode where they give you different little missions to go through.

02:17:17.491 --> 02:17:27.420
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the favorite ones we were doing was, I can't think of the name of it right off the bat, I think it's like the fifth or sixth one down, like in the third or fourth mission, like the second tier set of missions.

02:17:28.241 --> 02:17:30.463
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically because

02:17:31.975 --> 02:17:34.977
[SPEAKER_09]: I was the second player and my roommate was the first.

02:17:35.337 --> 02:17:45.044
[SPEAKER_09]: If he was the first player, you would actually try to get him off the base, but you're controlling the torrents that we're hacking into.

02:17:45.685 --> 02:17:47.966
[SPEAKER_09]: So one person will play at the hacked torrent.

02:17:48.147 --> 02:17:54.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you can sit there and mow down all the enemies as you're trying to get him to run through to the other side of the base.

02:17:54.151 --> 02:17:54.671
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty decent.

02:17:55.914 --> 02:18:01.298
[SPEAKER_08]: X-Link, I'm actually really interested to hear that you're into this game because I know you and I usually play a lot of the same types of games.

02:18:01.378 --> 02:18:04.461
[SPEAKER_08]: We both play WoW an awful lot, in fact, way more than we probably should.

02:18:04.841 --> 02:18:11.586
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we play a lot of the same type of puzzly games on Steam and so forth, but, you know, you are actually kind of jumping into Modern Warfare.

02:18:11.686 --> 02:18:17.271
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I, for one, am terrible at first-person shooters, so how hard is a game like Modern Warfare for someone like me?

02:18:18.792 --> 02:18:18.932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's

02:18:19.898 --> 02:18:22.519
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally, I suck at first-person shooters myself.

02:18:22.659 --> 02:18:27.261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm usually the one who's running into a room full of 15 enemies to try to mow them all down one time.

02:18:27.301 --> 02:18:30.963
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm basically the copycat of the noob from the commercial, basically.

02:18:31.063 --> 02:18:33.844
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, like, boring around, doing anything I pretty much could see.

02:18:33.904 --> 02:18:36.265
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really take my time, and I hide behind walls and stuff.

02:18:39.268 --> 02:18:43.531
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'm really bad at that because I'm so used to, I guess, Grand Theft Auto.

02:18:43.651 --> 02:18:44.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Quake.

02:18:44.772 --> 02:18:47.854
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you play Quake.

02:18:47.894 --> 02:18:52.618
[SPEAKER_08]: That will always be my favorite first-person shooter is Quake because there was no such thing as cover.

02:18:53.039 --> 02:19:04.748
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, like I said before, I take you back to the Quake and stuff like that and back to my days like being a rogue and just going around and pretty much popping up behind people and killing them.

02:19:04.788 --> 02:19:06.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

02:19:06.775 --> 02:19:09.697
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I liked it personally.

02:19:09.837 --> 02:19:10.717
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was a lot of fun.

02:19:10.737 --> 02:19:12.738
[SPEAKER_09]: The graphics were very, very cool to look at.

02:19:12.779 --> 02:19:13.899
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very updated.

02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:20.363
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that I got a problem with any of these games now, it's like, they're always talking about making the next one.

02:19:20.423 --> 02:19:22.484
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, how did they ever one-up what they did?

02:19:22.524 --> 02:19:35.552
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, seriously, like, I remember playing games and, like, getting used to, like, more, like, say, for example, Mario, like, going from Mario World to, like, Mario 64 and seeing the graphics change and ever, and seeing this process of evolution constantly going through.

02:19:35.632 --> 02:19:35.932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like,

02:19:36.721 --> 02:19:44.829
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to be, like, how far is it going to be from now on before they hit that brick wall, so to speak, before they can't go any further than they do?

02:20:01.264 --> 02:20:02.044
[SPEAKER_08]: Get ready for it.

02:20:02.064 --> 02:20:03.205
[SPEAKER_08]: You already have holograms.

02:20:03.485 --> 02:20:05.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if I can get in the holodeck in my wheelchair, I'm there.

02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:22.281
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week I called it the Bobby show and I was talking about Skyrim.

02:20:22.441 --> 02:20:30.423
[SPEAKER_09]: And I fortunately, because of the situation which you and Jamie are familiar with, with my roommate, and I'm going to get all that on the show.

02:20:30.523 --> 02:20:31.444
[SPEAKER_08]: Personal drama.

02:20:32.384 --> 02:20:33.604
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just say personal drama.

02:20:35.325 --> 02:20:39.246
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, long story short, I got fucked over $1,500 from my ex-roommate.

02:20:39.766 --> 02:20:40.306
[SPEAKER_09]: Bottom line.

02:20:40.727 --> 02:20:43.387
[SPEAKER_09]: And that caused a lot of problems from the beginning to the end.

02:20:43.467 --> 02:20:45.628
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, I was really looking forward to Skyrim.

02:20:45.668 --> 02:20:46.588
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it pre-ordered.

02:20:46.648 --> 02:20:48.529
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot of money down on it.

02:20:49.264 --> 02:20:52.227
[SPEAKER_09]: and, unfortunately, I had to cancel it last minute because of other priorities.

02:20:52.468 --> 02:20:57.293
[SPEAKER_09]: So, because of that, instead, I went to Redbox, tried to run what I could.

02:20:57.373 --> 02:20:59.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I still wanted to play something a little more new.

02:20:59.615 --> 02:21:01.377
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, Skyrim.

02:21:01.678 --> 02:21:02.238
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot.

02:21:02.298 --> 02:21:02.999
[SPEAKER_09]: I was being stupid.

02:21:03.039 --> 02:21:03.820
[SPEAKER_09]: I go there on a Thursday.

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:05.522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, okay, I'm going to go get Skyrim.

02:21:05.642 --> 02:21:07.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Not thinking that it came out the following day.

02:21:08.705 --> 02:21:09.266
[SPEAKER_09]: And, because it's

02:21:10.293 --> 02:21:38.645
[SPEAKER_09]: because of it I decided to get Modern Warfare 3 because Modern Warfare 3 was the closest one around the corner so I got that instead which was a little disappointing by any means because I was very blown away by it well you'll get to play Skyrim eventually and you know personal life stuff's more important and you know unfortunately that whole situation's kind of crappy but you'll get through it so yeah I will and you know I'm very patient I was the same way with Fallout and though I really was kind of pissed at um

02:21:39.948 --> 02:21:42.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for calling in and telling us about Modern Warfare.

02:21:42.129 --> 02:21:42.549
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

02:22:07.136 --> 02:22:10.425
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio

02:22:12.483 --> 02:22:14.524
[SPEAKER_08]: He made Modern Warfare sound.

02:22:14.684 --> 02:22:15.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it's pretty.

02:22:16.364 --> 02:22:20.185
[SPEAKER_08]: You're oogling the prettiness, and then you shoot bad guys in the face.

02:22:21.185 --> 02:22:26.766
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to more tweets, twitter.com slash orange lounge, or excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR.

02:22:27.867 --> 02:22:29.567
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a couple links from Tigerclaw.

02:22:30.067 --> 02:22:31.047
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, the trailer.

02:22:31.067 --> 02:22:34.368
[SPEAKER_08]: He linked us to the trailer for the Phoenix Wright live action movie.

02:22:34.408 --> 02:22:35.228
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys see this?

02:22:35.648 --> 02:22:37.849
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a trailer out there on the interwebs.

02:22:38.810 --> 02:22:40.216
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I saw some of this.

02:22:44.827 --> 02:22:45.927
[SPEAKER_08]: I will totally watch this.

02:22:46.008 --> 02:22:48.208
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've even got the guy's hairs all right.

02:22:51.390 --> 02:22:57.312
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite is... It's totally accurate.

02:22:59.413 --> 02:23:01.574
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that they have the style from the games.

02:23:04.595 --> 02:23:05.675
[SPEAKER_08]: I will totally watch it.

02:23:05.695 --> 02:23:07.296
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be like 20 kinds of awesome.

02:23:07.376 --> 02:23:10.537
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, she's even wearing the thingy.

02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:16.953
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's your one and only local convention whore, DJ Ranma S

02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:32.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, friends out there and a girlfriend.

02:23:32.101 --> 02:23:32.701
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

02:23:33.161 --> 02:23:34.022
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

02:23:34.082 --> 02:23:34.782
[SPEAKER_08]: You did it for pussy.

02:23:34.842 --> 02:23:35.222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

02:23:35.862 --> 02:23:36.822
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:23:38.303 --> 02:23:39.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, let me ask you something.

02:23:39.883 --> 02:23:41.343
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you done for ass?

02:23:41.464 --> 02:23:41.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

02:23:41.764 --> 02:23:43.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

02:23:48.163 --> 02:23:48.683
[SPEAKER_08]: No comment.

02:23:48.784 --> 02:23:49.064
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:23:49.084 --> 02:23:50.505
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright then.

02:23:51.266 --> 02:23:53.427
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just as bad as a whore as me, okay?

02:23:53.447 --> 02:23:53.808
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait.

02:23:53.828 --> 02:23:55.028
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:56.309
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm settled down now.

02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:58.091
[SPEAKER_08]: Those days are long behind me.

02:23:58.711 --> 02:23:59.212
[SPEAKER_05]: Same here.

02:23:59.952 --> 02:24:00.253
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:24:00.513 --> 02:24:02.494
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyhow, how was the con that you went to?

02:24:03.855 --> 02:24:04.536
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

02:24:04.636 --> 02:24:08.419
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the best part is you look across the waterfront, you see Canada.

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:10.100
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:24:12.022 --> 02:24:14.003
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, oh, better places.

02:24:14.184 --> 02:24:14.444
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:24:15.444 --> 02:24:16.065
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

02:24:31.061 --> 02:24:35.542
[SPEAKER_05]: If that was me, my mother would have tanned my high and I'd be hanging from a tree right now.

02:24:35.903 --> 02:24:38.263
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's different from when you and I were growing up.

02:24:39.164 --> 02:24:40.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, the same way.

02:24:41.164 --> 02:24:43.725
[SPEAKER_08]: My mother, oh my god, she would have lost her shit.

02:24:43.985 --> 02:24:44.965
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have lost her shit.

02:24:45.085 --> 02:24:53.648
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, she had such fear instilled in me that she had me convinced that there were like rabid dogs waiting outside to chew my face off if I ever tried to sneak out of the house.

02:24:53.708 --> 02:24:56.189
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, she slept with one eye open.

02:24:56.789 --> 02:24:57.189
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

02:24:57.769 --> 02:24:59.730
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same token though, I mean...

02:25:00.765 --> 02:25:28.179
[SPEAKER_05]: being in the schools for about a year I don't really see these 12 and 13 year olds being at a GameStop or at a Best Buy at midnight by themselves if they're with friends picking up the game that's believable but by yourself on a bike I don't see that I'm going to go ask Dan how many 13 year olds showed up at his midnight releases I'll be right back DarkSakura's for an M rated game what was the other thing you wanted to mention

02:25:29.162 --> 02:25:33.524
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to pick at Loki for a comment he said last week.

02:25:34.084 --> 02:25:34.424
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:25:34.744 --> 02:25:37.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has to pay for something he said last week.

02:25:37.105 --> 02:25:37.525
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

02:25:38.646 --> 02:25:40.046
[SPEAKER_05]: His comment about Skylanders.

02:25:40.586 --> 02:25:40.886
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:25:41.807 --> 02:25:50.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand where he's coming from about how silly the game is and how kids want their parents to get that game.

02:25:50.570 --> 02:25:54.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Without divulging too much information, I understand where he's coming from with that.

02:25:54.772 --> 02:25:55.552
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same token...

02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:57.401
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:26:18.789 --> 02:26:19.229
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:20.671
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

02:26:20.791 --> 02:26:21.751
[SPEAKER_08]: With their parents or no?

02:26:22.712 --> 02:26:24.614
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we find that out?

02:26:24.954 --> 02:26:28.557
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, I won't be doing that for my son because I'm not going to buy him stupid shit like that.

02:26:30.318 --> 02:26:32.180
[SPEAKER_08]: All the games have to pass the dad test.

02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.783
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, he won't be playing crappy games like Skylanders, please.

02:26:37.254 --> 02:26:37.995
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no problem...

02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:09.254
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem if he wants to play, you know, like a Connectimals or something like that.

02:27:09.274 --> 02:27:12.997
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a regular game, may not be something that I'm necessarily looking for.

02:27:14.479 --> 02:27:29.172
[SPEAKER_06]: But a game that promotes the whoring out of children to buy, you know, crappy toys, which, by the way, they keep putting out more toys because, you know, they're going to just add patches to the game so that more toys are compatible with it.

02:27:30.073 --> 02:27:57.996
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh so yeah it's basically just getting kids to beg their parents to buy them toys and you know what parents are dumb enough to buy them their toys then Activision deserves the money that they're getting from them but I'm smart enough to go no it's a toy that doesn't do anything how about I buy you a cooler toy instead and he'll be like okay you know what my rule is no TV until you're five I'm serious I'm dead serious try having a kid that's not gonna happen laughing

02:27:58.877 --> 02:28:02.242
[SPEAKER_15]: I know plenty of parents who have been completely successful with not having their kids.

02:28:02.262 --> 02:28:04.345
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to run out of things to do with them.

02:28:05.727 --> 02:28:06.408
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

02:28:06.689 --> 02:28:10.895
[SPEAKER_15]: I would rather them not be psychologically dependent on TV.

02:28:11.357 --> 02:28:13.698
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not dependent on it, but sometimes TV helps.

02:28:13.818 --> 02:28:16.859
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't want to be... I don't care.

02:28:16.979 --> 02:28:17.759
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't matter to me.

02:28:17.819 --> 02:28:18.459
[SPEAKER_08]: None of that matters to me.

02:28:18.479 --> 02:28:19.480
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get back to the caller.

02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:28.543
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Ranma, you're giving in to the Skylanders stuff for the sake of this kid who just wants it.

02:28:28.563 --> 02:28:31.164
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Ranma, did you buy one of the Tony Hawk ride boards?

02:28:31.224 --> 02:28:38.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was a cool little peripheral that they had for Tony Hawk, and you like supporting Activision, so did you buy one of those?

02:28:38.346 --> 02:28:38.406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:28:39.036 --> 02:28:39.596
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

02:29:08.850 --> 02:29:13.851
[SPEAKER_05]: If he starts talking with that type of attitude, I will take my belt off right there in Toys R Us.

02:29:14.151 --> 02:29:15.892
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and I will go to town on him.

02:29:16.132 --> 02:29:17.332
[SPEAKER_05]: You best believe that.

02:29:17.772 --> 02:29:23.993
[SPEAKER_06]: He can have the game when it gets into the bargain bin like March because that's pretty much when it's going to die out.

02:29:25.914 --> 02:29:26.254
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:29:27.014 --> 02:29:31.395
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ranma, I got to let you go to get more calls, but thank you for the lively discussion.

02:29:32.495 --> 02:29:38.658
[SPEAKER_05]: and one thing, Loki, I want you to know I've taken notes on some of this so I know what to look forward to when my time comes.

02:29:38.818 --> 02:29:40.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, he's taking notes!

02:29:41.299 --> 02:29:43.139
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm shaking!

02:29:43.579 --> 02:29:47.021
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean it in a good way, dude.

02:29:47.181 --> 02:29:49.642
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he means for when he has his bebe.

02:29:50.302 --> 02:29:50.982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:29:51.863 --> 02:29:52.983
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have a good one, Ranma.

02:29:53.403 --> 02:29:53.744
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

02:29:54.484 --> 02:29:54.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

02:29:56.095 --> 02:29:57.877
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Loki took that to mean, like, taking notes.

02:29:57.897 --> 02:29:59.379
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm writing down everything you say.

02:30:15.857 --> 02:30:17.118
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:39.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:30:58.596 --> 02:30:59.556
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the rest of a comment.

02:30:59.656 --> 02:31:02.778
[SPEAKER_08]: A patch is just around the corner and we will continue to ban cheaters.

02:31:03.178 --> 02:31:04.258
[SPEAKER_08]: We take it seriously.

02:31:04.358 --> 02:31:06.079
[SPEAKER_08]: That is our attitude here at Battlefield.

02:31:06.459 --> 02:31:11.200
[SPEAKER_08]: We have zero tolerance for cheating players and are banning more all of the time.

02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:12.021
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones.

02:31:12.061 --> 02:31:13.081
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:31:13.101 --> 02:31:13.441
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:31:15.222 --> 02:31:18.143
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, this is Amiga777.

02:31:18.243 --> 02:31:19.884
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Amiga777.

02:31:19.904 --> 02:31:20.604
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:31:22.544 --> 02:31:26.726
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about

02:31:27.642 --> 02:31:44.714
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSN hacks, the X5 Live hacks, and all that type of stuff So I guess one other thing to add to that is I guess much recently some Facebook hackings Well, about today

02:31:55.142 --> 02:31:59.327
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out about some thing that was going on.

02:31:59.347 --> 02:32:03.873
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a link from someone in chat.

02:32:05.315 --> 02:32:13.085
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess it was something about a gross video that nobody...

02:32:14.722 --> 02:32:16.844
[SPEAKER_10]: has ever really gone past it for 15 seconds.

02:32:35.584 --> 02:32:37.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch this video, it's really gross.

02:32:37.304 --> 02:32:39.145
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll usually be something like in the UK.

02:32:39.225 --> 02:32:40.845
[SPEAKER_06]: I had one of those one time that clicked.

02:32:40.885 --> 02:32:52.888
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, here's a video of something, blah, blah, blah, and you click on it, and then I realized immediately what it was, and I saw that it posted something to my board, so I blocked it, and then I deleted the post, and that was it.

02:32:53.728 --> 02:32:55.548
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everybody's so fast on the figure.

02:32:55.568 --> 02:33:01.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because if you post it to yours, and then a friend will see that, and they'll post it, and then so on and so forth.

02:33:01.909 --> 02:33:03.170
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happened, Amiga?

02:33:03.250 --> 02:33:04.410
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you accidentally fall for this?

02:33:06.816 --> 02:33:08.676
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my question.

02:33:09.157 --> 02:33:11.617
[SPEAKER_10]: What were they advertising in the video that made you want to click it?

02:33:11.657 --> 02:33:14.538
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it like, see big boobies now, click on this link?

02:33:30.475 --> 02:33:35.297
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said it was this really, like, nasty video that they were saying.

02:33:35.857 --> 02:33:46.001
[SPEAKER_10]: It had, like, this image of the back of this person's neck with this really large, you know, nasty zit on the back or something like that.

02:33:46.101 --> 02:33:48.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross!

02:33:48.462 --> 02:33:49.662
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:33:49.702 --> 02:33:51.063
[SPEAKER_08]: You're into, like, gross stuff.

02:33:51.083 --> 02:33:53.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine was a celebrity sex tape, so of course you clicked on that.

02:33:53.544 --> 02:33:56.865
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just real curious about it, you know, just tried to check it out.

02:33:57.745 --> 02:33:58.966
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know...

02:34:00.412 --> 02:34:05.456
[SPEAKER_10]: and then it asked me to do this little survey thing and I was like, I don't want to do a survey.

02:34:07.117 --> 02:34:08.578
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't sign up.

02:34:09.059 --> 02:34:11.320
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see the gross things on people's necks.

02:34:11.421 --> 02:34:12.782
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see a survey.

02:34:13.682 --> 02:34:14.443
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the boobies.

02:34:14.623 --> 02:34:15.884
[SPEAKER_15]: I have Shermie.

02:34:16.465 --> 02:34:18.887
[SPEAKER_15]: I already see gross shit, literally.

02:34:19.427 --> 02:34:26.293
[SPEAKER_08]: So, moral of the story, watch what you click on on Facebook because some of that stuff is like apps and who knows what.

02:34:27.574 --> 02:34:27.874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:34:28.667 --> 02:34:40.532
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and then the kicker after that was like a few seconds later, a few of my friends from TED is like, why are you linking me with this, you know, attachment?

02:34:40.732 --> 02:34:57.900
[SPEAKER_10]: I just found out that, you know, this thing after I just did whatever it told me, it ended up spreading the attachment message across all my other friends, and so I hated that.

02:34:58.979 --> 02:35:01.260
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I guess I ended up just saying, you know what?

02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:02.300
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:11.104
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to close up my Facebook account and whatnot and change my password and that type of stuff.

02:35:11.564 --> 02:35:12.665
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably for the best.

02:35:12.725 --> 02:35:18.727
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get hacked like that, you definitely want to close it up and delete all the crap and change your password as soon as you can.

02:35:19.127 --> 02:35:21.388
[SPEAKER_08]: So some good tips for the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:22.008 --> 02:35:23.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful what you click on.

02:35:25.604 --> 02:35:27.425
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, stick to the porn sites you know.

02:35:27.986 --> 02:35:30.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Amiga77, we're going to let you go buddy so we can get another call.

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:31.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, okay?

02:35:31.707 --> 02:35:32.968
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, bye bye.

02:35:34.049 --> 02:35:34.929
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful what you click on.

02:35:34.989 --> 02:35:38.891
[SPEAKER_08]: And see, Microsoft would have you believe that that's how your Xbox is getting hacked, but we'll see.

02:35:39.251 --> 02:35:40.552
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we got another call on the line.

02:35:40.632 --> 02:35:41.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio, who's this?

02:35:42.533 --> 02:35:42.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

02:35:43.273 --> 02:35:45.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio, who's this?

02:35:46.995 --> 02:35:48.716
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, wait a minute, I got a lag going on here.

02:35:48.976 --> 02:35:49.276
[SPEAKER_11]: One second.

02:35:49.316 --> 02:35:50.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll wait, it's cool.

02:35:52.319 --> 02:35:53.020
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry about that.

02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:56.342
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the show running while I was waiting for you to pick up.

02:35:56.542 --> 02:35:56.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:35:57.903 --> 02:35:58.803
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kaijudo.

02:35:58.863 --> 02:35:59.944
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Kaijudo, what's on your mind?

02:36:00.664 --> 02:36:00.964
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much.

02:36:01.004 --> 02:36:02.225
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just calling to cover a few things.

02:36:02.245 --> 02:36:04.287
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, I want to say thanks for my prize.

02:36:04.587 --> 02:36:05.247
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally got it.

02:36:05.667 --> 02:36:08.589
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we were kind of late in sending it, but yeah, we got it.

02:36:08.609 --> 02:36:09.270
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't even worry about that.

02:36:09.350 --> 02:36:10.290
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just calling to say thanks.

02:36:10.310 --> 02:36:15.293
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I wasn't going to rub it in or say, you know, you took forever or anything like that.

02:36:15.694 --> 02:36:21.057
[SPEAKER_08]: It took until we finally got another eBay shipment out where we just sent it along with the eBay stuff, so yeah.

02:36:21.317 --> 02:36:22.738
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:36:45.627 --> 02:36:46.368
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

02:36:47.549 --> 02:36:50.952
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember when I got that fake, it was Assassin's Creed?

02:36:51.012 --> 02:36:52.033
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't hear what he said.

02:36:52.333 --> 02:36:54.375
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one of you signed it, your mom.

02:36:54.455 --> 02:36:54.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:36:54.815 --> 02:36:55.956
[SPEAKER_08]: And my mom opened the package.

02:36:56.497 --> 02:36:56.577
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

02:36:59.484 --> 02:37:01.226
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

02:37:02.187 --> 02:37:06.471
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing I want to get to is you mentioned earlier I'm not an Xbox fanboy.

02:37:06.852 --> 02:37:07.552
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just a gamer.

02:37:07.713 --> 02:37:08.594
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all the systems.

02:37:09.254 --> 02:37:14.099
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned before that you couldn't remove your credit card from Xbox Live.

02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:15.941
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually do it.

02:37:15.961 --> 02:37:16.922
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to call in

02:37:19.411 --> 02:37:22.474
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hate that I have to do that.

02:37:23.014 --> 02:37:28.819
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that they're allowed to make it so easy to give it to them and then it's not as easy to take it away.

02:37:28.959 --> 02:37:37.425
[SPEAKER_08]: I get the business side of it and everything, but just after everything I've been through with that company, it's like I'm almost insulted.

02:37:38.286 --> 02:37:42.067
[SPEAKER_08]: That they would make me go through that after getting hacked and all that stuff.

02:37:42.147 --> 02:37:46.788
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing is I'll call them and get it taken off that way.

02:37:47.088 --> 02:37:50.689
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my point is at the end of the day, it just sucks that I have to do that.

02:37:50.989 --> 02:37:54.709
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't I take it off the account as easy as I was able to put it on the account?

02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:59.470
[SPEAKER_11]: The other weird thing about it is if you do want to remove it midway through your...

02:38:02.555 --> 02:38:06.879
[SPEAKER_11]: through your billing cycle, they tell you that you'll lose your Xbox Live.

02:38:06.899 --> 02:38:13.404
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have the card removed, but you'll lose whatever that amount of weeks or amount of days that you have left on gold.

02:38:13.644 --> 02:38:16.146
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, that's kind of bullshit too.

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:17.768
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a real problem I have with it.

02:38:17.808 --> 02:38:20.610
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're not really getting the card off your account.

02:38:20.650 --> 02:38:22.211
[SPEAKER_08]: You're telling them that you want to cancel.

02:38:23.092 --> 02:38:26.655
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to cancel you because you don't want to keep a credit card on file with them?

02:38:26.975 --> 02:38:28.837
[SPEAKER_06]: And you already paid for it at the beginning of the year.

02:38:28.857 --> 02:38:29.237
[SPEAKER_08]: There's proof.

02:38:29.477 --> 02:38:35.520
[SPEAKER_08]: When there's proof that that credit card information is being exploited, and they just don't want to admit it, that pisses me off.

02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:36.440
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:37.280
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm going through now.

02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:43.423
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke with someone, and you also have to call them to have the automatic renewal removed.

02:38:44.003 --> 02:38:44.724
[SPEAKER_11]: But not anymore.

02:38:44.744 --> 02:38:52.407
[SPEAKER_11]: I called to say that I wanted the renewal removed, and when my subscription is up, I want the card removed, and then I'll just pay through.

02:38:53.327 --> 02:39:09.921
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever that is now supposedly the automatic renewal is all you're able to do that on the website because that was part of the big upgrades they did this week that Jamie was talking about earlier is that you know you can turn that automatic renewal off and I did see that switch so that has changed recently as in like the past week week and a half

02:39:10.541 --> 02:39:15.845
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the credit cards go, I went in there and I saw a place where you could click remove to remove the credit card.

02:39:16.145 --> 02:39:24.692
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I tried to do that, it said, oh, you can't do that because you're using that card to pay for your one month of Xbox Live that you used a card for.

02:39:25.032 --> 02:39:27.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a credit card, but like an over-the-counter card.

02:39:27.174 --> 02:39:27.814
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what?

02:39:28.435 --> 02:39:28.635
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

02:39:30.796 --> 02:39:34.659
[SPEAKER_11]: and two other quick things and then I'll let you get to some more calls.

02:39:34.819 --> 02:39:38.961
[SPEAKER_11]: The Saints Row, when I mentioned was it the day improved from Saints Row 2?

02:39:39.801 --> 02:39:50.548
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing I was talking about with the camera was I remember in Saints Row 2 they didn't have, you know like GTA 4, you have like three different I think camera angles you can do.

02:39:50.928 --> 02:39:54.470
[SPEAKER_11]: You can be like up close, you could be like midway and then like really far back.

02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:56.331
[SPEAKER_11]: Saints Row 2 didn't have any of that.

02:39:56.391 --> 02:39:59.053
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like your character was always in the way of your...

02:39:59.853 --> 02:40:02.095
[SPEAKER_11]: Your little rectical thing.

02:40:02.595 --> 02:40:04.537
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm talking about?

02:40:04.557 --> 02:40:05.538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

02:40:05.578 --> 02:40:05.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:40:06.038 --> 02:40:07.299
[SPEAKER_11]: So did they improve on that?

02:40:07.539 --> 02:40:09.361
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what really killed it for me.

02:40:09.621 --> 02:40:12.423
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I couldn't see what I was shooting at, and especially in multiplayer.

02:40:12.703 --> 02:40:19.749
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they don't have multiplayer anymore, but it was really hard to play multiplayer when your character is so blown up in front of you like that.

02:40:19.889 --> 02:40:19.969
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

02:40:20.969 --> 02:40:23.390
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really had that problem, but I mean, I don't know.

02:40:24.631 --> 02:40:27.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think they have any sort of way.

02:40:28.172 --> 02:40:33.434
[SPEAKER_06]: You can adjust, I think your camera, you might be able to adjust your camera distance.

02:40:34.014 --> 02:40:35.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me try to look here real quick.

02:40:38.035 --> 02:40:39.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Vehicle camera stamp.

02:40:40.196 --> 02:40:41.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Instant, yeah.

02:40:41.576 --> 02:40:44.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they have a way to adjust the camera.

02:40:44.878 --> 02:40:45.378
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we go.

02:40:45.518 --> 02:40:45.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's...

02:40:47.431 --> 02:40:49.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, I don't see a way to adjust the camera.

02:40:50.394 --> 02:41:04.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, there is, I guess, you know, you can manually adjust it, but, um, yeah, I will find it, you know, it's really a problem being in the way, because you do have the aiming reticle on the screen, so, uh, you can see where you're shooting at.

02:41:07.267 --> 02:41:08.927
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember playing Saints Row 2?

02:41:09.087 --> 02:41:10.548
[SPEAKER_11]: How long ago was it?

02:41:10.748 --> 02:41:11.828
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played it.

02:41:12.449 --> 02:41:13.189
[SPEAKER_11]: I got that game.

02:41:13.209 --> 02:41:13.889
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even kidding.

02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:22.692
[SPEAKER_11]: I got Saints Row 2 the first day it came out, and I maybe played it for two weeks, and I haven't played it since the original year that it came out.

02:41:24.153 --> 02:41:27.374
[SPEAKER_11]: The driving and that close-up camera just really...

02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:28.931
[SPEAKER_11]: Screwed the game up for me.

02:41:29.171 --> 02:41:31.673
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really had trouble with the camera at all.

02:41:31.693 --> 02:41:33.494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the driving being too bad.

02:41:33.554 --> 02:41:39.919
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I played that game to almost 100%, and I played Saints Row 1 all the way to 100%.

02:41:39.979 --> 02:41:46.964
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's including the three DLCs for the second game as well.

02:41:47.584 --> 02:41:50.066
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, I don't remember it being a problem.

02:41:50.306 --> 02:41:50.707
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:41:50.747 --> 02:41:54.269
[SPEAKER_06]: This one doesn't seem to be a problem so far, and I'm about 40% through.

02:41:55.593 --> 02:41:58.254
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm still going to get three, just with everything it has in it.

02:41:58.315 --> 02:42:00.155
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just curious about that.

02:42:00.536 --> 02:42:04.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, I can take screenshots in the game, which is pretty awesome.

02:42:04.177 --> 02:42:06.319
[SPEAKER_06]: You can upload them to the SaintsRow.com site.

02:42:06.739 --> 02:42:10.841
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish I did that when I saw Professor Genki shooting rockets at pedestrians.

02:42:10.941 --> 02:42:12.522
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, whoa, what's that?

02:42:13.502 --> 02:42:14.283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's different.

02:42:15.383 --> 02:42:17.326
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to miss multiplayer in this one.

02:42:17.346 --> 02:42:27.440
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the one game that they removed multiplayer where I'm like, I have no problem with that because that multiplayer, I hate to admit it, it was terrible for me.

02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:28.282
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have been better.

02:42:28.322 --> 02:42:29.243
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have fixed it.

02:42:30.222 --> 02:42:30.882
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's it.

02:42:30.962 --> 02:42:32.443
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing Skyrim.

02:42:32.883 --> 02:42:33.444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great game.

02:42:33.664 --> 02:42:34.244
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that.

02:42:34.964 --> 02:42:36.565
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who hasn't picked it up, pick it up.

02:42:36.885 --> 02:42:38.786
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm freaking loving it.

02:42:38.806 --> 02:42:39.747
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have a nice night.

02:42:40.087 --> 02:42:42.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, no problem.

02:42:42.288 --> 02:42:43.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy your bootleg copy.

02:42:43.749 --> 02:42:44.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care.

02:42:45.289 --> 02:42:45.489
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:48.331
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:42:48.371 --> 02:42:49.132
[SPEAKER_08]: Good calls tonight.

02:42:49.152 --> 02:42:49.772
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, you guys.

02:42:49.832 --> 02:42:55.076
[SPEAKER_08]: To those that didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but did you catch the part where we said we had no emails this week?

02:42:55.416 --> 02:42:55.516
[SPEAKER_08]: One.

02:42:55.596 --> 02:42:57.277
[SPEAKER_08]: We had one that came in right before the show.

02:42:57.698 --> 02:42:59.879
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should write down your thoughts, and we'll read them next week.

02:42:59.919 --> 02:43:04.462
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangeentree.com, or you can tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:43:05.203 --> 02:43:08.245
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, in the meantime, I need to finish up just a couple tweets here that we had.

02:43:08.725 --> 02:43:13.769
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya tweeted us and said, so the DDR freak thing is still sort of happening in Milpitas.

02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:14.550
[SPEAKER_08]: Road trip?

02:43:15.350 --> 02:43:16.132
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I heard about that.

02:43:16.152 --> 02:43:18.197
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a Facebook invite for that today.

02:43:20.403 --> 02:43:20.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe?

02:43:22.847 --> 02:43:47.380
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know it's kind of one of those we have a show I don't know we'll see um I'd like to go but it just might be too last minute for me I got something else going on next weekend too uh Actdeft last tweet tonight sequence that rhythm rpg game for cheap if enough users subscribe to the page game getter uh getter.gforums.net I guess uh

02:43:48.965 --> 02:43:49.847
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:44:02.410 --> 02:44:02.990
[SPEAKER_08]: What page is that?

02:44:03.611 --> 02:44:08.773
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getter.g-forums.net Look at the tweets to OLR.

02:44:09.153 --> 02:44:15.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Because right now the game usually costs $5 and right now it's down to $3 because 101 people have subscribed.

02:44:15.835 --> 02:44:17.196
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are you subscribing to?

02:44:18.316 --> 02:44:19.217
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to be careful.

02:44:20.457 --> 02:44:21.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you're not subscribing to spam.

02:44:22.898 --> 02:44:24.418
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for tweets tonight.

02:44:24.679 --> 02:44:27.220
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go around quickly and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:29.701
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've covered everything but I'll check with Loki real quick.

02:44:29.741 --> 02:44:30.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any last minute stories tonight?

02:44:31.149 --> 02:44:31.629
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge

02:44:57.951 --> 02:45:12.686
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course the season pass the first season pass has been announced and this includes the DLC or at least the first three DLCs that are going to be coming out and if you ordered this game off of THQ their store you actually got it for free

02:45:14.567 --> 02:45:38.084
[SPEAKER_06]: and in season pass we'll save you 15% off of buying the DLC separately and so what it includes is Genki Bowl 7 which is supposed to be coming out in January and the description is the wild world of Genki takes over Steelport in a sporting tradition totally and utterly unlike anything else and this is why I was laughing before

02:45:38.704 --> 02:45:43.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Gangstas in Space is the second DLC coming Winter 2012.

02:45:43.247 --> 02:45:48.291
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saints Go Intergalactic in the Science Fiction Misadventure.

02:45:48.671 --> 02:45:51.353
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last one is Trouble with Clones.

02:45:52.333 --> 02:45:53.574
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's coming Spring 2012.

02:45:54.115 --> 02:45:57.297
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says a copycat killing at its finest.

02:45:58.177 --> 02:46:05.082
[SPEAKER_06]: And also it includes the Nightblade DLC, which includes... And Nightblade is one of the fictional, like,

02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:12.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Nightblade Mobile, Alter Boy Outfit, Bloody Kenanus Outfit, and Bloody Kenanus Bike Which I believe is $20

02:46:28.678 --> 02:46:37.524
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, we talked a little bit about some cool streaming of game demos on YouTube.

02:46:38.785 --> 02:46:42.247
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, now there's one for Dead Rising 2.

02:46:42.327 --> 02:46:46.390
[SPEAKER_06]: They can stream through your web browser using Gaikai.

02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:53.835
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe it's on YouTube, but let's see here.

02:46:55.296 --> 02:47:16.990
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom Unity had a link to it and I believe it's actually it's on through Gaikai.com so if you go there you can check it out it's a 30 minute demo that's pretty awesome wow that's that's that same site that had the FIFA demo that we talked about a couple weeks ago yeah nice very cool

02:47:18.137 --> 02:47:18.417
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:47:19.659 --> 02:47:19.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

02:47:19.979 --> 02:47:22.002
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for the stories?

02:47:22.222 --> 02:47:22.502
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:47:22.562 --> 02:47:25.326
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at these leaked costumes.

02:47:25.586 --> 02:47:26.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw that from HitStun.

02:47:26.887 --> 02:47:31.333
[SPEAKER_08]: It had posted a link in chat for the Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3 download costumes.

02:47:32.068 --> 02:47:33.989
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's like a Weapon X Wolverine.

02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.729
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:47:35.070 --> 02:47:35.790
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty cool.

02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:39.652
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of Beautiful Joe out of costume.

02:47:39.852 --> 02:47:45.195
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad now in retrospect that we didn't buy Marvel vs. Capcom 3 now that there's the ultimate one that's coming out.

02:47:45.215 --> 02:47:46.916
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I bought it, but you know, I'm cool.

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:52.499
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there's one of What's Her Face, the other chick from Devil May Cry with the white hair.

02:47:52.921 --> 02:47:53.201
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:47:53.902 --> 02:47:54.342
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

02:47:55.083 --> 02:47:55.343
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:47:55.363 --> 02:47:57.585
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.

02:47:57.665 --> 02:47:58.205
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

02:47:58.385 --> 02:47:59.826
[SPEAKER_15]: The worst ever character.

02:48:00.487 --> 02:48:00.567
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

02:48:02.509 --> 02:48:08.994
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one of Iron Patriot, who was the character that I hated during the whole Civil War thing.

02:48:10.395 --> 02:48:11.616
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is actually pretty cool.

02:48:11.756 --> 02:48:14.638
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Clone Spidey, the Ben Reilly Spidey.

02:48:15.089 --> 02:48:16.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up.

02:48:16.229 --> 02:48:20.831
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna close up shop and say goodnight for now until we see you next week.

02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:24.651

[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:49:02.815 --> 02:49:12.642

02:49:12.782 --> 02:49:13.843
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like I'm having to wait.

02:49:13.883 --> 02:49:15.004
[SPEAKER_08]: Disneyland games.

[SPEAKER_08]: Disneyland games.

02:49:15.944 --> 02:49:17.385
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to do Disneyland again.
