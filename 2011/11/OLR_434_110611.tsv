13936	24213	Tonight, November 6, 2011, a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto is unveiled, a major MMO goes free to play, and what is in store for the Wii next after Skyward Sword?
31653	36637	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36877	38418	Orange Lounge Radio.
38498	41901	We are live tonight, November the 6th of 2011 with the 434th show.
47245	55676	We were off last week, but we're back tonight to join you over the next few hours live to talk about video games and gaming culture and have some lols, hopefully.
55756	58279	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-host.
58660	61784	Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61944	62344	Hi.
62525	62945	How are you?
64287	65408	I'm tired, Rob
84565	111618	yeah yeah yeah I've heard that term before I've actually I've wanted to go I here's my thing with BlizzCon as much as I love the Blizzard products I'm sorry I'm not paying $150 to go to your publicly open press conference and play your demos like I don't get does not compute function but but I will totally go to go to all the hotel parties because there's some sweet parties they get thrown and then like Discon I'll go for that because like shit I go to Disneyland all the time anyway if you listen to the show any length of time you know that
111778	120361	I just kept running into other WoW players and so I'd go talk to them and Dan would just roll his eyes and go somewhere else because he pretty much hates it.
120521	121042	The WoWs.
121342	122182	He hates the WoWs.
122742	126904	And I've got a new obsession too, which is the WoW model viewer.
127779	127959	Red Bull
153928	154308	Thanks for watching!
179232	182017	They want to pay me in a big tub of Red Bull.
182037	184341	Get that little car to drive around and come give you some.
184641	187987	But DarkSakura fed you some of her extra dinner or whatever.
188308	189871	Were you just cooking for the fun of it?
190757	204828	I wanted beef stew because it's gotten cold outside, and I had broth, you know, stuff to make broth out of, so I just made, I made a vegetable broth in the crock pot overnight, and then I made the beef stew in the morning.
204908	207149	And crock pot cooking is in right now.
207230	209451	Like, I notice a lot of people are, like, really into it.
209471	210312	It never went out.
210792	211193	It's easy.
211233	211773	I don't know why.
211833	213354	Like, it just seems like I'm noticing it more.
213434	215436	The Paula Deen recipe for pot roast is...
215896	217177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
235336	235836	DarkSakura.com
253121	253922	Dance Dance Revolution
270095	285983	and we used to go to these marathon sessions of playing that at the arcade and we would go to dinner afterwards with other friends and we just sat around and talked shit about video games whether it be DDR or whatever else is at the arcade for hours and hours afterwards and I had been dabbling in internet radio so at DarkSakura before that
286824	301105	and so we decided to kind of take that into an internet radio show and Loki joined us along the way and that's where Orange Launch Radio was born we pride ourselves on the fact that we interact we do the show live, we always have very rare are we not live usually it has to be a computer issue or something
302086	321965	Out of the 434 episodes we'd have, I'd say about 430 of those are probably live And interacting with you guys in our chatroom We have you guys in chat, giving live commentary on the show Also you guys can call us later in the show We like to embrace new social media as it comes out So Facebook, we're on there, Twitter, we're on there
322205	323045	We give it a big kiss.
345936	348398	I will never say no to that, I don't care what it is
376994	397618	and Skyrim is out on Friday and I'm just thinking like oh god that's gonna be another sucking my time away and I'm hearing it's great which I was expecting so yay I don't have enough time to play everything what games are you guys looking forward to this holiday season if anything DarkSakura is there anything maybe it's already out I'm looking forward to sleeping
398579	401921	I'm looking forward to the semester being over, so to actually play the shit I have.
402822	412850	Honestly, because I started playing Symphony of the Night again, and I've just been too tired to really play anything other than WoW and the other couple things I'm playing.
413710	418772	It's honestly, if it comes out and it falls into my lap, I'll be happy to play it.
419712	426235	If it comes out and it's something that I want, I'll find a way to make it happen.
426275	430976	But right now, I'm just not really doing the looking forward to anything kind of deal.
431517	433877	I'm doing the get me through the next three weeks.
434077	435238	We go to print next week.
436358	436778	This week.
437739	439219	Fuck me, we go to print this week.
439539	440060	Oh my god.
440200	440820	IRL stuff.
442381	444924	Loki, what are you looking forward to this holiday?
444964	445725	Like I had to ask.
446145	447226	And that's Tuesday, right?
448227	449008	Next Tuesday.
449508	450329	Oh, next Tuesday.
450609	452051	Do you have any special events?
452311	453733	Did you take Wednesday off work?
454133	455935	Do you have anything planned special?
456365	461593	DarkTetsuya says, Loki, would you play anything even if it's Skylanders 2?
473854	476215	You're going to send me a free copy of that.
476296	478637	I'll do something creative with those toys.
478937	486002	Looking at Twitter and getting the feel for what people are saying, I'm seeing a lot of positive stuff about it, especially from the people that have kids.
486962	489404	Really seem to enjoy Skylanders as a fun game to play with kids.
489424	492686	I'm glad that they were able to lower their standards for their kids.
493186	497329	because, you know, kids, they're definitely not attached to stupid toys nowadays.
498370	508498	Like, you know, and trust me, Activision is getting behind publishing games that are on the DS for a lot of those stupid toys that you're just like, I don't understand why these kids like that.
508718	509179	But you know what?
509199	509799	That's fine.
509819	510980	And I understand.
512281	517865	I'm not trying to sound like, you know, the bitter old man or whatever that's like, oh, I don't understand these kids.
518266	522209	I don't understand these kids' games and their toys and blah, blah, blah.
522597	525860	No, seriously, their toys are stupid compared to the stuff that we used to have.
526221	528263	I mean, our toys used to do stuff.
528403	533408	I mean, it may have been stupid things like, you know, karate chopping arm and stuff, but you know what?
533448	535050	Teddy Ruxpin was the fucking future.
535090	535910	He could read anything.
536511	537332	I have a Teddy Ruxpin.
538013	538593	I know you do.
539854	540295	And grubby.
542992	544553	and most of the... My buddy.
545414	547015	Wherever you go, he goes.
547636	549337	I had one of those things.
550037	555901	Man, his face is definitely hard and you can do some serious injuries to other people with that stuff.
556301	559744	No, but... I'm just saying, like, okay.
560404	561225	Skylanders...
562867	564289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
581212	582033	Hell, you know what?
582273	586516	Buy your kids a good game and buy them some other toys that are also very good.
587576	598424	I was just going to say, for those that didn't have the privilege of growing up when these old people here on this program grew up, just let me take you back a few years here as to what we were into at the time.
598664	599084	Here you go.
602386	605569	Now, I wasn't necessarily into My Buddy, but my parents bought it for me.
621195	623421	It's just a giant fucking doll.
624203	626769	It's just like... Kidsisters at a tea party, though.
628041	636027	I mean, it was just seriously... I mean, it could have been just a Cabbage Patch doll, but... That's probably what it was trying to capitalize on.
636047	637648	I had Cabbage Patch Kids.
637728	639249	Sorry for the poor audio on that.
640430	642191	And I'm not saying that that toy was good.
642411	643532	That toy was not good at all.
643732	644893	Yeah, I recognize that it was.
645213	652959	And yeah, Teddy Ruxpin was kind of an interesting toy because it was a thing that played tapes...
653419	654339	You know, cassette tapes.
655120	658081	I know some kids that are maybe even listening to the show don't know what that is.
658582	659602	But cassette tapes.
660062	667406	And they would actually move their mouth to the actual audio.
667426	669147	Because I think they had it split or something like that.
669207	670147	And that's how it worked.
671348	673129	And it would read stories to you.
673309	674029	And interact.
674049	675590	They had the little play sets and stuff like that.
676690	677551	And those are kind of cool.
677591	679852	Because at the time it was pretty cutting edge stuff.
680772	680992	But...
682333	684177	I'm sorry, I love this comment in our chat room.
684497	690568	Alpha Cananogram says, I had a My Buddy, but then I saw a movie or clips of a Chucky movie and stopped playing with it.
690769	691771	Oh my god, you know what?
692671	693812	I can't say I blame you there.
693972	700876	Yesterday, and okay, I'm on the American River Review staff and we sometimes go in on Saturdays and Sundays to do extra work.
701416	702197	So we play movies.
703457	719827	And yesterday we were watching an MST3K movie that was called The Devil Doll about this mannequin and we just kept singing the My Buddy theme over and over every time the mannequin would show up on the screen.
720307	721088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
737746	738266	and one of the
762759	763380	Herp-a-derp!
763460	765502	Of course it was all Halloween-themed, stupid!
765863	770869	They had one that was all Hollywood-themed, and they had all the recreations of the different movies.
771289	776996	And one of the rooms had a Chucky doll, and it was really scary and good life, and then it started moving.
777216	778398	They had a freaking midget!
778738	779819	as the Chucky doll.
780039	780560	That's awesome.
780620	782081	It started following you around.
782121	783061	It was freaky.
783622	784983	Yeah, they were really good at scaring people.
785463	788406	This was the only way some people would do it.
788426	790607	They had a rule, like a strip club.
791068	793129	We don't touch you, you don't touch us.
793349	794570	There was a no touching rule.
794871	797933	But they will get right up in your face and all this stuff.
797953	800695	They had a Freddy Krueger that had sparks coming out.
801215	801776	That's awesome.
801816	802917	It was really well done.
802957	805499	But the Chucky doll, just the whole talk about that made me think of this.
805959	806600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
826198	827080	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
842982	844544	Don't test me on my Silent Hill.
845044	846125	I'm not, I'm not.
846966	850008	One of the other things that truly scared me was the dentist in there.
850028	852010	Because, you know, the dentist is scary.
852530	859096	And had an air gun that you didn't know he had until just the right person, which happened to be me, walked by.
859376	861457	And you have the drilling noises and all of a sudden, psst.
862078	862879	And I was like, ah!
863119	863279	No!
864895	865796	Thanks for watching!
883368	888574	Or buy them like, I mean, fuck, $200 you can buy a really nice, you know, toy or something.
888654	890936	Or a lot of toys for $200.
891997	895241	And I can guarantee they'll probably have a lot more fun than they did with Skylanders.
895421	898324	Yeah, it's a neat concept, but, I mean, come on.
900205	902387	You can buy a cheap arcade cabinet for that.
923060	925321	Did they have this?
926162	927302	Or do they have this now?
928343	929283	That they had when I was a kid?
929543	933745	Because this is what I would spend $200 on.
936487	938207	Domino Rally was the shit.
940148	942730	Like your dominoes would do like loop-de-loops.
945231	947452	Check out that awesome 80s power music to this commercial.
947572	949353	And like dominoes would go down slides.
951403	954933	and this took all day to set up for like 10 seconds of fun.
956377	958858	Domino Rally, get all three sets.
959478	960098	There's more than three.
960338	961838	I would have spent $200 on Domino Rally.
963939	964439	All right, anyway.
966080	970081	I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks, but DarkSakura left, so I guess we'll do things out of order.
970561	977063	We'll move into our gaming weeks, the types of video games that you have been playing this week, and Loki will start tonight with you, since DarkSakura left the room real quick.
977163	979683	Her husband just got home, so I think she had to go tend to him.
979763	981584	Mainly Grand Theft Auto 4, usual.
982524	983844	You know, still playing Lost and Damned.
983884	985405	We moved to airport games now.
986045	996330	and my co-worker was getting slightly better at killing people in the airport and of course I refined my technique and now I'm up there with him again.
996950	1001232	But we're having some pretty high scoring games like $3,000 games which is pretty awesome.
1002532	1016777	And then, of course, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row II on PC with a wonderful add-on patch from a group called Idle Ninja.
1017577	1023059	And they have a patch mod, if you will, called Gentlemen of the Row.
1024369	1024969	Thanks for watching!
1044495	1045015	Thanks for watching!
1059247	1059928	Thanks for watching!
1080442	1085328	And then let's see, other than that, I played Plants vs. Zombies on the iPod again.
1085348	1086469	I went back to that a little bit.
1086890	1087831	I'm on the roof now.
1088532	1090254	They had a huge sale at Halloween time too.
1090394	1091475	I think you could get it for like 99 cents.
1092270	1093892	Yeah, I mean, I like the game.
1093952	1099978	It's just, it's a little annoying that it just keeps ramping, like, it keeps changing the game, like, every single level.
1100298	1103882	And I don't mind it, like... Well, do you want the same stage as every level?
1103942	1104823	That would be boring.
1104843	1106525	No, it just should get more difficult, you know?
1106605	1108387	Just, like, I don't know.
1108407	1110889	Yeah, they put new game mechanics in every stage.
1110989	1111790	Yes, exactly.
1113712	1130019	and that's fine you know it's pretty cool so I've been playing a little bit of that and then um what else uh that's pretty much it actually just not a whole lot but I mean I can't wait I'm just like
1132350	1134292	I need the Saints for the third.
1134312	1134972	I need it.
1135232	1138375	Hoping your distributor connections will come through and you can get the game early this week.
1139796	1140376	We'll see.
1140617	1142618	After the week I've had, I'm ready.
1142978	1145961	Next Sunday's going to be a big Gaming Week show because hopefully Loki will have that.
1146001	1146942	I'll have Skyrim.
1146962	1150224	DarkSakura will have... I don't know what she'll have, but it'll be good.
1150745	1153307	I'll have a weekend that I can sleep through.
1154268	1154508	All right.
1154728	1158371	DarkSakura, sorry we started without you, but we'll go back and do your Gaming Week.
1158391	1158811	That's okay.
1158931	1159652	I had to potty.
1160160	1162541	Oh, I thought you ran out and said hi to Dan because I heard he got home.
1162861	1163481	All right, well, what's up?
1163601	1164221	How was your gaming week?
1164541	1165281	I played well.
1166101	1170182	And I played DC Universe online, which is kind of ass.
1170643	1171123	You didn't like it?
1171963	1174823	Well, I'm not saying that I hated it, but the control is really crabby.
1175444	1179044	And I hate that you have to keep turning the camera as you're running and doing everything.
1179845	1182365	And with my trackball mouse, it's just not reasonable.
1182445	1187887	I mean, I could do it really easy in Portal 2, but I can't really do it for DC Universe.
1187907	1188307	You know why?
1188547	1188727	Why?
1188787	1189347	Because it sucks?
1189867	1190987	Well, no, not because it sucks.
1191467	1192408	I mean, maybe it sucks.
1192428	1193368	Because trackballs suck.
1193408	1194128	I don't know how you do it.
1194188	1195128	I hate trackballs.
1195708	1206591	Mainly because I think the game is meant more to be played with a controller than... Because using a right analog stick to control your camera is kind of natural for a lot of people.
1206631	1212232	You might want to give it another go with an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your computer if you have any wired ones, because the game will pick it right up.
1212512	1219194	Because the game was designed to be console slash... Kind of like Final Fantasy XI was, and you felt more comfortable with that on the controller.
1219214	1219334	Yeah.
1219594	1220875	That might be the trick.
1221095	1221616	Or it might not.
1221676	1221976	I don't know.
1221996	1223037	I mean, DC Universe is a very different kind of game.
1223057	1225459	But I've also been playing more with keyboard and mouse so much lately.
1226520	1229362	And keep in mind, using a regular controller actually hurts my hands after a while.
1230162	1234806	So I can't play a game for a long period of time like I can if I use keyboard and mouse.
1235767	1240991	You should try one of those things that look like a kickboard that they were pimping on All Games Network a while back.
1241391	1242773	Oh no, that thing was painful.
1243624	1245847	Oh yeah, I gave them to you.
1246047	1251293	No, actually no you didn't, but I saw one at the store and it's too painful.
1251814	1252214	It's too bad.
1252395	1252875	It was painful.
1253055	1254397	I don't know if I remember seeing one.
1254417	1262386	I don't remember what they're even called now, but they look like they had all these weird, almost like a spider-like thing over the controller that you hear.
1262987	1268972	It's supposed to improve your reaction time by hitting the different buttons, by kind of moving your fingers in different ways and stuff like that.
1269373	1270013	Yeah, they're terrible.
1270193	1272095	My coworker took one home.
1272155	1276399	Brad from PodCulture is in our chat room right now and says, Pat, controls are just fine.
1276479	1277580	Use a 360 controller.
1277680	1280602	So another vote to try a controller, I guess.
1281123	1282664	That's how I was playing in the beta.
1282844	1283405	I know, I know.
1283885	1284426	I'm just saying.
1285066	1289230	Yeah, I mean, honestly, I'm playing a PC game because I want to play a PC game.
1290611	1292553	And, you know, it's fine.
1292773	1296236	There's also, I ran into way too many derps by the time I got through the Brainiac thing.
1297069	1299091	Star Wars MMO Star Wars MMO
1320970	1322311	Star Trek Online Stayed pretty consistent
1338618	1340199	DC Universe is also just a really different MMO.
1340259	1340799	It's not WoW.
1340819	1341459	It's really not WoW.
1341479	1345622	It's more like, imagine if Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game, was an MMO.
1345642	1349824	It's like playing City of Heroes, but even worse control.
1367210	1368311	City of Heroes is fine.
1368431	1372493	That's why I could play Star Trek online because it played like City of Heroes, which is no problem.
1373053	1375894	But, of course, me and my Marvel love, I made a chick Hawkeye.
1376975	1377295	Anyway.
1377315	1380817	I mean, her name is Hawk in Hebrew.
1380937	1385399	Maybe that was just your problem is you just couldn't do the DC Universe thing.
1385659	1388721	I've been enjoying watching Dan play through Arkham City.
1388841	1390402	Yeah, but Batman's Batman, you know?
1392063	1395244	That and I just think the whole Batman Catwoman thing is hot.
1395264	1397345	I actually sat down and read two DC comics.
1397805	1398145	Wow.
1398286	1403368	I read the first two issues of the new Catwoman thing because it had Batman Loki in it.
1404048	1404268	Wow.
1406409	1407469	It was pretty hot too.
1407729	1409550	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
1410109	1424937	um oh yeah R-Type on the iPhone really hard to control I was gonna say I mean no it's actually not hard to control but like once it's like it's how I am with R-Type anyway once you lose those power-ups it's sort of like what's the point I'm gonna die in five seconds
1426033	1428275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1454284	1459187	No, it was awesome, because it was X-Men, and it's prepared to die.
1459667	1459968	Alright.
1460228	1468072	I also tried a little bit of Crafted, which is the Minecraft knockoff on the iPod, iPhone, or whatever that's 2D.
1468673	1472195	Yeah, I care about that as much as I care about Minecraft.
1472315	1474456	I'm just like, nope, don't care.
1474937	1475677	Try playing it.
1475717	1476718	Sounds like Terraria.
1476938	1477858	I also have something else.
1478018	1478799	Can I talk about it now?
1479059	1479239	What?
1479359	1482001	The other fun thing I've been playing with that isn't a game but related to a game.
1482021	1482181	Sure.
1482581	1483882	I've been playing with the WoW Model Viewer.
1484966	1485406	Why is that?
1485526	1486707	Just because you're obsessed with WoW?
1486807	1491228	Well, because there's a webcomic going to be coming out called Hillsbred Blues.
1491768	1492788	Keep your eyes open, everybody.
1493529	1504412	But I've been playing, actually I spent last night while my internet was down looking through all the different models and finding the unused ones and all the derp ones and finding what the spawners look like.
1504812	1507973	So if you see a bunny, be careful, it could spawn something.
1508333	1510614	They use bunnies a lot for spawning things.
1511306	1526003	Alright But yeah, it's just kind of fun I found Alfred Copperworth And I found Alexandra McQueen So I'm just laughing at the NPC names Good times I think it's fun Yeah I like to see what makes my games tick
1527735	1528356	My gaming week.
1529376	1533057	I've played Warcraft as well, but I've played a heck of a lot of console stuff too.
1533077	1535318	I want to talk about a few games I've been playing this week.
1535778	1540239	The first I'll talk about is a game called Disney Universe, which came out a couple weeks ago.
1541000	1542980	It's on, I think, 360 and PS3.
1543000	1544421	It might be on PC as well.
1545501	1558068	at first glance it looks like a little big planet Disney game and I would say that's true to an extent but the game itself plays more like a Lego game like if you played those at all I saw the trailer actually for the game when I was seeing Ghostbusters
1558433	1584393	And I've played the game a little bit and it's cute, it's a basic platformer, definitely something that younger kids and tweens would get into Those folks that are expecting it to be like Kingdom Hearts, nah, no, it's a lot more simple But if you're into Disney like I am and you like to collect things because the game has a lot of collectibles Especially like powering up different suits, yes there is a Tron suit, that's why I had to go with that It was also in the trailer
1584733	1587935	Yeah, and there's stuff from Pixar is involved too.
1588275	1590436	So there's definitely a lot of stuff to just kind of absorb.
1590596	1592237	But the game itself is very basic.
1592397	1595118	It's definitely not the depth of LittleBigPlanet.
1596319	1600941	And therefore, the $60 price tag, excuse me, I think it's actually a $50 price tag.
1600981	1601081	It's $49.99.
1602021	1606764	I actually got three games from the Amazon buy two, get one free sale, which are the games I'm talking about tonight.
1607304	1610946	And so I don't really know exactly how much they all were because I paid like $100 for three.
1610966	1611606	Yeah, it's $50 retail.
1611666	1612186	Is it $50 retail?
1612206	1612386	Yeah.
1613627	1633436	that's still asking a bit much this is something that I think is going to be a great deal when it's on sale for 20 or 30 but if you're like really hardcore into Disney or you really just want like a basic platformer for fun something with collectibles I think you'd be into it but if you're looking for something a little more like a game with a lot more depth I'm not so sure you're going to find it here
1634296	1641299	You definitely see the inspirations from LittleBigPlanet, some of the minigames and so forth, which are cute but very basic.
1641739	1644640	The game is not anything you haven't played before.
1644800	1647261	It's just with Disney-looking Sackboy characters.
1647682	1647922	Cute.
1649502	1652163	A game that I played a bit more of was Dance Central 2.
1652204	1655105	It came out this past couple weeks, and...
1656145	1658669	Yeah, it's definitely an improvement over the original.
1659470	1662834	Some things I noticed right away, fitness mode is like 10 times better.
1663214	1667780	They have some prearranged fitness playlists that you can play, which I was having a lot of fun with.
1668020	1672946	There's a story mode kind of built into it, which encourages you to mix up the songs a little more too.
1674027	1674908	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1691937	1705554	But one thing that disappointed me a little bit is that when you did that, and surely they had to know that there was a lot of people that were going to do that, it doesn't really integrate the Dance Central 1 stuff into the non-arcade modes.
1706054	1707436	Like the fitness mode and the...
1708357	1708977	DarkSakura.com
1728943	1756856	with Dance Central 2 is I don't think the song list is as strong as the first game there's some good songs in there but there's also some kind of really derpy songs as well like there's a Justin Bieber song in there there's a Britney cover in there and it's like harmonics is better than covers like I understand that Britney's very danceable and you want a Britney song in your game but you shouldn't have to resort to covers you can get another song there's danceable songs out there that are not Britney Spears and you know what people probably don't care yeah
1757356	1765504	So, I mean, but there was some songs that made me laugh, like there's Hadaway's What Is Love, and so it made me really laugh that that was in the game, and yes, you do the head bob as part of it.
1766085	1766545	That's awesome.
1766766	1773272	But, you know, that's the kind of thing you lull at parties, but, you know, once you've played it once, you don't really want to play that song over and over again.
1773672	1775875	But it did have some, it had some good songs.
1776635	1778037	The dances, um...
1779542	1781463	You know what, guys out there?
1782283	1795347	You're going to have to kind of let your inhibitions go for some of these dances because all I have to say... If you play Born This Way by Lady Gaga, expect to do moves like princess snaps and...
1797368	1822243	something about Queen like where you make the little crown like she does in the video if you've ever seen the Born This Way video they kind of put that dance move in there so like I can just imagine a bunch of bros playing Dance Central 2 I mean not that that's really like the broski kind of game to be playing anyway but let's just say that you know it found its way out at a frat party like if you want to impress the ladies expect to really let your inhibitions go in some of these dances
1822523	1822783	Um, yeah.
1848760	1849761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1867163	1871927	Usually when I leave OLR, I want to go home and play WoW, but today I want to go home and play Arkham City because I'm really into it.
1872667	1881394	I'll say this, the story just... I loved that you had five villains in the first 15 minutes, but it didn't feel like overload.
1881454	1883856	It felt like it made sense with the story, it was good.
1885777	1890061	Yeah, I love that it's open world now and that there's all these side quest things you can do.
1891442	1893844	It's more fluid than the last one to me even.
1893944	1895566	I can't even put my finger on it.
1895646	1897487	It's like GTA Batman.
1898208	1899729	Yeah, and that's really rad.
1899809	1901991	I'll tell you something too.
1902151	1905394	As you finish certain parts of the game, you actually...
1907397	1908378	Thanks for watching!
1925339	1927001	Some of them are just cake.
1927081	1927661	They're right there.
1928462	1929983	But some of them are really hard.
1930424	1932546	But the Catwoman switching out is actually pretty neat.
1933607	1936029	So you'll get points that you can switch out with Catwoman.
1936570	1937010	Very cool.
1937230	1939612	Yeah, I put in the code to get that.
1940453	1941074	She cracks that whip.
1967051	1967311	What?
1967511	1969953	Where she slides under a door like that or something like that?
1970013	1971754	Well, the new movie's not out yet.
1971794	1972174	No, not the new.
1972194	1973295	Are we talking about Batman Returns?
1973495	1974536	I'm talking about Batman Returns.
1974556	1976217	I don't think she's ever mentioned that.
1976917	1979499	And on top of that, she didn't have the cleavage in Batman Returns.
1979519	1981360	But this is, I mean, Batman Returns was what, 1993?
1981440	1987063	It was the full body black suit and this is the zip up jumpsuit Catwoman.
1987143	1993307	And like, when that movie came out, Bane wasn't even in the Batman universe yet, I don't think.
1993447	1995568	So, you know, a lot's changed since then.
1995728	1996229	But, um...
1996869	2000553	Yeah, I'm having a really good time with it, so I can't wait to go home and play more of it.
2001514	2002175	We're having a good time.
2005599	2006500	Slick interface, too.
2007341	2009423	Even right away from the menus, I was like, this is really cool.
2009463	2010084	And I want to play the 3D.
2011906	2018613	It has like 3D where you can just use red and blue glasses or some type of, I think some other type of glasses I'm sure they're selling.
2019074	2021496	But yeah, you can get 3D with a 2D TV, which is kind of cool.
2021717	2027383	I have to say that the whole thing is actually a very well done package.
2028644	2033870	Now, Leo Shannon in our chatroom says, yeah, but when you play Catwoman, they all refer to her as bitch.
2034813	2035333	Well, yeah.
2035353	2037475	They call Batman the Bat.
2038315	2040876	Well, I mean, bitch is a little bit more derogatory.
2041057	2051302	But, I mean, well, whereas maybe they could use a little more variety in their derogative terms, I do get the sense that they're taunting Batman as well.
2052003	2055285	But I haven't played as Catwoman much more than the opening sequence yet.
2055665	2059507	But if they do just keep saying bitch, bitch, bitch, that does seem a little bit lazy to me.
2060864	2063565	Pretty much, or they'll say it's the cat or Catwoman.
2063706	2071209	I mean, they call her by name, but they also say... I mean, the first thing, if you've got a woman who's being annoying to you, what's the first thing you're going to call her?
2071349	2071589	Bitch.
2071609	2071909	Bitch.
2072330	2072790	Exactly.
2073030	2076051	If there's a man being annoying to me, the first thing I think to call him is bitch, too.
2076291	2077232	Yeah.
2077472	2079173	Maybe I'm just an equal opportunity bitcher.
2080053	2080894	Call him dick.
2081175	2082937	But keep in mind this too.
2083217	2085740	They might be calling you a bitch, but you're about ready to kick their ass.
2086481	2093170	The one tiny negative I will say about Batman, granted I'm playing it on easy because I really just want the story.
2093830	2095252	It is a little bit button mashy.
2096013	2121279	but it's button mashing with finesse if that makes sense like it just it's very fluid and it's cool like it's not to the point where I find it annoying it's button mashy in the way that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the arcade game was button mashy and it was still fun so I have to say that I really like the artwork that's come out with the game I'm sure on the harder modes there's more to it than just button mashing but I am playing it on easy so
2121721	2123702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2140815	2147565	For the sake of having a clean podcast, we are going to try and just tear straight through without really stopping because of downtimes.
2148226	2151691	So we apologize to the live listeners, but it is an issue that's out of our control.
2152032	2154916	Like, DarkSakura, you said your net's gone down, like, what, three times over the weekend?
2154956	2156899	It affected your rating in WOW last night?
2157699	2172104	It's gone down off and on over the last three days, and I thought that it was finally stable, and we got all the way through ICC, Icecrown Citadel for those who don't know, and get to Arthas, and then it starts freezing on me, and I knew it was going to go down again.
2172124	2176926	And no porn torrents, so we really thank... I've already downloaded Supernatural.
2177446	2180189	We really thank the live listeners for tuning in and sticking it out.
2180209	2183892	We apologize we can't fix it but it is an issue with our internet service provider.
2184573	2188056	So for the sake of having a clean show we're just going to try and push right through.
2188436	2194302	If we go down we are probably aware so no need to send me 50 tells that we're down because we probably know.
2195862	2197523	Also, I'll say this real quick.
2198163	2205264	Podcast Award results came out, and we didn't win, which, you know, you have to prepare yourself for the fact that you probably won't win.
2206064	2210825	The same show that won for the past couple years, Four Player Podcast, they won again, which is, you know, good for them.
2210926	2212026	They work hard on what they do.
2212226	2215947	It's an independent show, and we always said from the top, we won an indie show to win.
2216347	2218747	An indie show did win, so that's awesome.
2218947	2222128	And not only did they win the gaming one, they won the Grande...
2223228	2223788	TACO TACO TACO
2249699	2259704	Not that our community is any less because you guys, we were so thankful that you guys were putting out the call for retweets and posting on Facebook.
2260285	2264347	Other all-game shows were showing support for us, which really meant a lot, you guys.
2264487	2275493	We saw the plugs on other folks' website and the banners that were like, hey, our show is not nominated, but go vote for these guys because we like them and we're on the same network.
2275793	2276914	And that really meant a lot.
2277034	2306609	and I'll also say what also meant a lot to us throughout this whole thing that was awesome was that over on Facebook we actually posted you know the other night when we found out about the results we kind of you know said hey we didn't win but you know it's cool at least we were nominated you know out of what hundreds of gaming podcasts out there we were one of ten nominated and only half of them were general gaming shows a lot of them were very specialized shows about Warcraft or other MMOs or what have you so that was just really awesome to even have that
2307129	2310612	And the response we got on Facebook was just awesome.
2310632	2312073	We got some comments on the post.
2313454	2315756	By the way, it's at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2315776	2317317	If you're not our friend, you should add us.
2317557	2320779	Terry replied and said, You won my award and that's all that matters.
2320839	2322721	Six plus years and still listening.
2323501	2326624	Fabrice commented on the post saying, I'd even say you won our hearts.
2326724	2330206	Making such a great podcast for so many years is quite an accomplishment.
2330266	2331627	And stuff like that...
2332928	2334829	is... Makes my heart warm.
2335430	2337070	For just a moment, it does.
2338171	2340452	But yeah, stuff like that... Mine's longer than a moment.
2340512	2341413	Rob, what are you thinking?
2343254	2345975	So, I just want to say thank you guys so much.
2346116	2348537	Everybody who supported us, even though we didn't win.
2350052	2351013	It's all good.
2351273	2353914	We're still here and we don't have any plans to go anywhere.
2354074	2356395	Because we're broke.
2357376	2360177	So, that's it for housekeeping.
2360758	2363039	As I mentioned, Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2363079	2364700	Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2365220	2366380	And now, the gaming news.
2366681	2366921	Loki.
2367984	2368284	Ah, yes.
2369425	2377490	So, this week was pretty big, at least for me, because, hey, they put out a trailer for Grand Theft Auto V, and that makes me happy.
2377990	2384595	So, yes, the pretty easily guessed sequel to Grand Theft Auto IV.
2385515	2390758	Now it's, of course, returning back to Los Santos as part of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2391219	2394461	This time, I believe, though, it's supposed to be centralized more around...
2395021	2395862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2411340	2412121	What's this going to be about?
2412161	2413082	Where are the new things in there?
2413482	2415804	Some of the things that you see in the trailer, animals.
2416165	2418747	There's a dog, at least in a cut scene.
2419448	2426714	Not sure if you're going to be able to kill animals, but obviously in their last game, Red Dead Redemption, there were plenty of animals running around that you could kill.
2426754	2430097	That would be really risky for them to do that and incur the wrath of PETA.
2430177	2435602	And I know you guys don't care about that stuff, but that is a bunch of negative publicity I think the game could do without.
2436363	2436743	DarkSakura.com
2458382	2462644	People get very possessive about their cats and dogs, almost more so than they do people.
2463845	2465725	The PETA people are crazy anyway.
2465805	2466926	I'm not just saying PETA.
2467206	2470047	If they're gonna work that stuff into the game, they better tread carefully.
2470087	2470768	That's all I'm saying.
2471968	2474049	It's a volatile ground they're walking with that.
2474249	2478372	Some of the other stuff, of course, planes coming back.
2478752	2480493	A lot more aircraft in there.
2481194	2482554	A blimp is in there.
2482615	2488578	Who knows if you can fly a blimp, but definitely it was something that was part of the skyline.
2488638	2489439	That was kind of cool.
2492501	2494923	There's a huge variety of landscapes there.
2495263	2498885	Everything from the mountains to the city slums.
2499305	2502928	They showed three different characters in there that you might be playing as.
2503308	2508912	One of those, the rumor to be the main character from Vice City coming back.
2509613	2513196	And then also there looks like maybe CJ from San Andreas.
2513916	2518460	And then a new character all making the return maybe to this game.
2518940	2519801	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2537057	2538739	Just in time for the Wii U launch.
2539700	2542842	It would be good timing if they want a Grand Theft Auto on their platform.
2542862	2546125	Sorry, can I say this about the pet discussion we were having a minute ago?
2546425	2549328	AkumaJP in our chatroom says, don't worry, all dogs go to heaven.
2550782	2579071	that's true, that's true cats on the other hand no, I'm just kidding, I love kitties good thing Shermie's not in here all cats go to special heaven should make that face at you no, cats go to special heaven sorry Loki but yeah, it's seriously amazing if you haven't seen the trailer for whatever reason go check it out, rockstargames.com and I can't wait to play it it'll be awesome and how many times did you watch the trailer?
2579252	2579792	about 10-15 times
2581673	2584757	People are really dissecting even just every little frame of that.
2585018	2586099	Kind of like a movie trailer, though.
2586300	2591687	There's some really stupid people out there that are like, Hey, hey, look at that address that's on there.
2591707	2593289	That meeting's just coming out in May.
2593329	2594491	I'm like, no, you're stupid.
2595533	2596834	I'm a bit frightened now.
2598703	2601265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2623342	2631525	This is not usually the type of game we play, but there's a million, actually five million to be exact, people out there that are playing this game this week.
2631605	2632486	It's Battlefield 3.
2633646	2635627	It is huge in the gaming industry.
2636067	2640089	Five million gamers throughout the world bought Battlefield 3 this week.
2640769	2649293	That is internal estimates from EA, so that could be a little bit inflated, but to be honest, I wouldn't put it past that that is actually the legit number.
2651730	2652671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2675430	2682139	And as far as the multiplayer experience goes, where you get to shoot, shoot, shoot to kill, it's a lot of fun.
2683681	2685824	But Loki, you're trying to get this right now?
2686064	2692874	Well, I was looking to maybe try it, at least the single player, because it looked fun.
2693823	2694423	I don't know.
2711033	2714695	It sounds like there's a lot of rabble rabble about the Origin integration.
2714715	2718397	I want to say I was reading something about a crack has already come out for the PC version.
2718737	2723380	Of course, this wouldn't affect the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 ones, but the PC one specifically.
2723760	2727102	I guess a crack has come out that has now disabled the Origin.
2727142	2730284	You don't need it anymore, which is not a surprise at all.
2730784	2731385	I'll tell you this.
2732265	2736586	I didn't talk about this at the top of the show, but you guys know my Xbox was hacked a couple months ago.
2736606	2737426	I talked about it on the show.
2737506	2737987	Lost some money.
2739587	2745148	I played the demo for Need for Speed The Run this week because that's the game I'm actually looking forward to.
2745749	2747629	But I don't play a lot of EA Sports games.
2747929	2750670	The only EA Sports games I really get into these days are the racers.
2752119	2761224	So the reason why I bring that up, when I logged in to Need for Speed The Run, it told me that my Xbox Live gamer tag had already been tied to an email account that wasn't mine.
2761704	2762845	It belonged to somebody else.
2762925	2770149	In fact, I was able to Facebook that person and see what she looked like and wonder if that was the person that maybe took my money.
2770189	2771690	Well, FIFA is an EA game.
2772250	2772991	I know, I know.
2773151	2774012	FIFA's an EA game.
2774052	2776095	And this person made the account on there.
2776555	2777476	Now, I don't know.
2777496	2780220	The hacker could have just used a random email address.
2780420	2783524	But it was interesting that I was able to look this person up on Facebook.
2783544	2785326	I think you need to confirm it, though.
2785386	2786367	Like, I don't know.
2786387	2786768	Yeah.
2789030	2803884	I called EA to get that unattached to get my real EA account attached to my gamer tag because I wanted my actual one on there and I wanted that one unattached I was on hold for 25 minutes waiting to speak to somebody over there
2805669	2807270	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2825780	2853013	and my response was dude we told you change your password so people out there on Xbox please please change your password and this is what I'm going to honestly recommend you do go download the demo for either NBA Jam or Need for Speed The Run especially Need for Speed The Run if you like racer games like it all like check that one out because it's actually kind of rad like that snow level is pretty awesome check out the demo because when you play the demo you can attach
2855074	2871745	and I would think if you could do that in advance it might help against the hackers like I'm not sure again nobody knows what they're doing besides charging up these money I think they're loading up Xbox Live accounts and then trying to sell them or something so I don't know what it is they're really doing
2872345	2874566	So it's hard to say what measures to take to prevent it.
2874646	2875126	But I will say this.
2875146	2880968	Well, what they're doing is I think is like you download that content to your console and then you don't need that account anymore.
2880988	2883869	It's like kind of downloading a full version of a game.
2883889	2884349	I don't know.
2885069	2885909	I will say this.
2886590	2891051	Everybody I know who got hacked, none of them play EA Sports games.
2891791	2893872	And it's just an interesting trend I'm noticing.
2894472	2910011	so go get your Xbox Live account attached to an EA account I hate that I'm telling you to go sign up for an EA account because in a perfect world I would be saying clearly there's an issue here that nobody's admitting to which is infuriatingly difficult
2910692	2932389	but go do it because you don't want to lose $150 like one of our other listeners did this week so please please don't be like us change your Xbox Live password now if you haven't already and you know what take the extra precaution and attach an EA account to it through the Need for Speed to Run demo or any EA Sports demo that's out there there you go
2933730	2936632	Techness in our chat room disagrees with me.
2936912	2941534	Need for Speed the run looks horrible, but it uses the EA login for all their games via Origin.
2942175	2946797	I played it on 360, not PC, so I didn't have the whole Origin thing, but I kind of liked it.
2946877	2947357	It was cool.
2947377	2948198	I don't know.
2948478	2949919	But I like racing games, too.
2949959	2951239	I like arcade racers like that.
2951319	2955622	I can't do Forza or Gran Turismo, but I can totally do Need for Speed and Burnout.
2955862	2956522	So that's just me.
2958103	2958423	All right.
2960345	2962789	Akuma JP asks in our chatroom, is EA the hacker?
2963751	2964232	Who knows?
2964352	2967217	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com They do like money.
2967577	2969500	Let's move on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.
2970029	2976191	Well, as I mentioned earlier, this is a game that I've been playing, sort of, is DC Universe Online.
2976611	2985875	It's gone free to play, and it's been sending the game down for maintenance off and on, which I've actually run into myself.
2987415	2996539	But you can actually go download it through the Sega Online Entertainment Launcher, and the game's being revamped to handle the people.
2997519	3008026	and also their user numbers have hit 330,000 players which is a 600% increase.
3009527	3010207	This is pretty crazy.
3011508	3015270	Meaning that everybody went to check this game out the minute it went free to play.
3016030	3017491	Yeah, I mean, I was curious.
3017772	3018532	I checked it out.
3019012	3019873	I know a lot of people that did.
3020113	3020953	Don't care for it.
3020973	3022254	I'm not going to play it anymore.
3022594	3024195	But I wouldn't have paid for it.
3024255	3024816	I'll tell you this.
3025016	3026657	I would have been really pissed if I had been paying for it.
3027327	3053840	I played it during the beta and I liked it enough where I would have played it more but I didn't want to be paying for multiple MMOs because I think at the time I was playing the beta I was playing for WoW and something else and I don't remember what it was but yeah I didn't want to add another one into the mix so I didn't go through with it and I was really happy when they announced they went free to play but then I heard the first day just that the servers are crashing left and right which doesn't surprise me well the login's taking forever and it would like freeze the loading your character
3054680	3056941	I was just like, you know what, this isn't worth it to me.
3057001	3064063	I'm already paying for one game that I like, and another game that I like is coming out free to play, so why am I worried?
3064883	3066043	I'll still check out DC Universe.
3066063	3068564	I like the idea that it's a console MMO.
3069024	3075545	I might get it on PS3, although all my friends are on PC, just because, I don't know, I like the idea of an MMO on my console.
3076806	3077186	Kind of fun.
3078945	3086313	I like DC Universe well enough I'll check it out now, it's free to play I'm not as humbuggy Alright, let's move on with some more news
3087188	3101616	Alright, so this is kind of sad, I guess, but... Silicon Knights, so... Silicon Knights, they've cut their staff by nearly 75%, going from almost 100 people down to 25.
3101936	3110501	And of course, they just released X-Men Destiny, which didn't really get that great reviews, and Two Human, which really didn't get good reviews.
3111041	3111282	So...
3112863	3117646	Yeah, that might be a good reason why they're cutting.
3119427	3134639	But yeah, apparently it has been confirmed that they had those layoffs, although they're saying that the number is actually maybe a little bit lower than that because they're also creating new jobs as well.
3135359	3136080	Yeah.
3138092	3138432	I don't know.
3138872	3159117	It's interesting that these cuts have to happen, but I guess since they just finished the game and it didn't do that well, so they can't... Sadly, this is kind of what happens a lot lately, which doesn't make the news any better to report, but... Yeah, I mean, it's just...
3160697	3162378	I'm not surprised.
3163358	3167120	I thought X-Men Destiny looked alright, but apparently it seemed rushed.
3167640	3183946	And maybe that's not necessarily the fault of them, but I kind of think it might be a little bit... They're a little bit to blame, because look at 2 Human, a game that was delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed, and it still sucked when it came out.
3184466	3192630	So, I don't know if more time would have actually helped them in this case, but probably didn't help that they were a little short in time.
3192790	3200754	I guess the silver lining, though, is that a lot of times when these studios have these massive layoffs, the big people kind of go tend to form their own new company.
3201255	3203536	Like, that kind of happened with Bazaar recently, which I...
3204236	3207878	Still, I still cannot believe that they shut that studio down.
3208158	3209099	I mean, I do and I don't.
3210000	3210700	It's sad.
3211020	3212741	It was horrible.
3213121	3216544	But, you know, they go start a new company and it might turn out okay.
3218185	3220886	Another company that has some layoffs, Gameforge.
3221206	3225169	They're kind of known for doing some browser-based games.
3225669	3232213	But also, they dropped their staff from 450 down to 350 recently.
3234254	3257923	and of course they've recently cancelled a few different games, Mythos and Hellbreed and I guess they're not sure if they're going to be able to finish now it was supposed to be a free to play or freemium Star Trek game, Star Trek Infinite Space that they were going to be co-publishing I wonder if Star Trek Online going free to play somehow ended up being a conflict of interest with this
3259826	3260566	Just a random thought.
3260746	3261007	I don't know.
3261027	3261327	Maybe.
3261927	3262287	I don't know.
3262307	3263427	I mean, it looks kind of cool.
3264208	3265968	I don't know much about it, though.
3266088	3267369	It's kind of the first time I've heard of it.
3268409	3277552	And, of course, their comment is, through a more efficient, organized structure, we can optimize our use of resource and greater... Fluff, fluff, PR fluff.
3277592	3278732	Fluff, fluff, fluff.
3278752	3280292	Trying not to sound evil and terrible.
3280633	3281253	Fluff, fluff.
3281293	3287335	Yeah, which... It's all of, like, well, we've got to cut costs, so we're going to have less people doing more.
3287455	3288455	That's, you know...
3289318	3291479	I've heard that one over and over and over again.
3292560	3293881	Yeah, it's unfortunate.
3294201	3296862	Once you get down to like five jobs per person, then yeah.
3297002	3304306	Let's hope these guys maybe can team up with the other ones who just got laid off and hopefully start a new studio that makes some awesome things that's better managed.
3304907	3305267	Let's hope.
3306772	3307112	Let's hope.
3308413	3312935	Alright, anyhow, moving on with some more game news that hopefully is a little less depressing.
3313856	3316457	Well, if you're a Sony fan, this is actually pretty exciting news.
3316637	3321460	The PlayStation 3 is catching up to the Xbox 360 in terms of shipments.
3323101	3349942	Q2 2011 it was reported that Sony has sold 3.7 million PS3 units around the world and that quarter ended September 30th so they have sold thus far 55.5 million units and they're improving Microsoft has 57.6 million shipped units worldwide so they're getting really neck and neck
3350642	3355506	Sony could overtake this number two position depending on how the holidays the next year goes.
3356787	3362192	Keep in mind, we don't know if these companies are talking about what's called sell-through or sell-in.
3362672	3365074	Sell-through means all the way to the consumer at home.
3365455	3368217	Sell-in means just on the retail shelves.
3368677	3369998	Either way, though, just, I mean...
3370999	3371420	BlueRay
3386101	3387822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3408659	3411160	Honestly, the games are getting better on the system.
3411420	3414682	They didn't have much for a while, and now they're really getting the good ones.
3414862	3418183	Everybody in the gaming world gave PlayStation 3 shit when it came out.
3418383	3418984	Everybody.
3419184	3421385	I mean, except the very hardcore Sony fans.
3421785	3426307	It took them a long time, but now they've made steady progress to try and get better.
3427488	3431970	I still don't think everything is all roses and sunshine, like PlayStation Move.
3433810	3435871	Are they still trying with PlayStation Move, Loki?
3435951	3439692	Or did they finally just kind of shuffle it to the back?
3439732	3440892	No, they're definitely still trying.
3441032	3441752	Are they?
3442853	3450134	They've got a bunch of new games coming out and new bundles to try to drive PlayStation Move stuff.
3450674	3452795	Looking at just the month of November, you've got
3452935	3454015	DarkSakura.com
3475744	3486737	There's also a bundle with sports champions, Medieval Moves, Deadman's Quest, and then that game was also coming out by itself from Sony+.
3487257	3488238	iPet and Friends.
3489980	3492662	That is coming out as well if anyone gives a shit.
3493082	3496164	And kids.
3496184	3500687	They've got some new bundles and hardware stuff.
3500807	3503409	Maybe I'm just kind of like poo-pooing the move.
3503429	3504970	There's a lot of games that support it.
3505070	3507091	Everything I see is about Kinect.
3507572	3512855	And even then, like this year, I don't think Kinect's going to have the same impact this year as it did last year.
3512875	3519560	Honestly, if I had a choice between playing a Kinect game and a Move game of the same game, I'd rather play the Move game.
3520240	3524884	Just, it seems to be more accurate, you know, to me.
3525325	3530789	I really kind of want to play Child of Eden on the PS3 because I think that'd be awesome.
3530809	3532591	Because the move stuff, it seemed to work really well.
3532631	3534072	Connect sometimes is just kind of eh.
3534372	3536174	But, you know, the dancing games are pretty awesome.
3536314	3538415	I mean, I just can't really see myself playing.
3538636	3540057	It's becoming a one-trick pony.
3540097	3542499	It's nothing but the dancing games that are remarkable, you know?
3542919	3558318	Yeah, kinda, kinda, and a lot of the games, unfortunately, I think for, not so much with the move, because a lot of people are developing stuff for the move, kinda do stuff with the Wii, and they've kinda gotten over that phase of, hey, look, we're gonna make it, you know, where you can waggle to do different things instead of pushing a button, but...
3559224	3561685	How has the Kinect evolved a year later?
3561785	3564527	What are we seeing on the Kinect now that we didn't see a year ago?
3565127	3567948	Child of Eden and sequels to all the shit from last year.
3567968	3571650	I wouldn't even call Child of Eden that new because it's just an on-rails shooter, basically.
3571730	3575272	Yeah, but it was a type of game we didn't have last year.
3575772	3578153	But has Kinect really changed gaming?
3579801	3581903	Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition is stupid.
3601016	3602057	Oh, look at me.
3602197	3605559	I can actually use the voice command to switch between old graphics and new graphics.
3605659	3606380	Who gives a fuck?
3606520	3607681	I mean, that is stupid.
3607961	3609562	Why would I need to do that on the fly?
3609982	3613765	Or why would I need to yell grenade when I can push a button and it does grenade?
3613865	3615246	I mean, it's dumb.
3616266	3619088	So, you know, if they had head tracking or something like that for...
3620189	3627233	Halo, that'd be kind of cool where if you're moving your head, it moves the camera slightly so that there's a little bit more integration there.
3627633	3628733	I mean, that could be really cool.
3628773	3635957	I mean, they're just, unfortunately, the head tracking stuff that they're doing, like with Forza 4 even, like looking left and right, that doesn't work.
3636477	3645722	I mean, if you're moving your head a little bit and it's tracking your head and it changes the camera's perspective based on where your head is, that's kind of cool because that's a little bit of immersion there, but
3647136	3647456	I don't know.
3647596	3649618	Some of the stuff that they're doing right now is kind of useless.
3649738	3651259	But yeah, there's tons of dancing games.
3651559	3653721	There's tons of sports games.
3654081	3658284	There's just stuff you don't really... I don't know.
3658404	3660065	Dancing and sports games is pretty much it.
3661326	3663287	Well, PlayStation 3 is gaining a little ground.
3663428	3670332	And I got to admit, I don't want to blame the hack for this, but I don't know what to put my finger on it with.
3670372	3675976	But I got to say, all these games I've been buying lately, if there exist versions on the PlayStation 3 and the 360...
3677177	3678058	I've been getting them on the PS3
3700330	3707454	I gotta admit, I can't put my finger on it, but I've just been more drawn to my PS3 lately.
3708275	3708795	Owning both.
3709415	3711116	So this news doesn't really surprise me.
3713678	3714739	It's the better controller.
3716880	3718981	I think that weighs a lot more than you think.
3719481	3720882	By the way, Skyrim pre-ordered on PS3.
3720962	3726005	I do actually have to say that the PS3 controller is actually just a slightly bit more comfortable.
3727186	3728947	For my injured hand.
3729467	3733569	I hate that Microsoft has not changed that goddamn hideous D-pad.
3733689	3735630	Outside of special edition bullshit.
3735670	3736370	That doesn't count.
3736670	3740032	The D-pad's alright and even the special edition stuff didn't really help.
3740432	3742873	But the controllers are alright.
3742993	3751096	I mean, I don't really give a crap about the... Or I don't really care for the convex trigger buttons that are on the PlayStation 3.
3751136	3751196	But...
3752717	3753178	Who cares?
3753458	3757161	That doesn't really stop me from playing different games on these consoles.
3757441	3760844	Really, I don't play anything on the PS3.
3760884	3767749	If I'm going to buy a game, it's because I don't really play with a lot of people on the PS3 online.
3768229	3769991	I just don't do it.
3771492	3775455	It's just too bad because I've got a lot of games that I have on the PS3 that I haven't played yet.
3776036	3779199	Going to Salacious Pop in our chat room at chat.orange.com.
3779259	3785304	Salacious Pop says, Connect has actually turned out to be a great utility for special needs people, the deaf, mobility issues, whatever.
3785604	3788707	But as a household hardcore entertainment device, I don't think it really succeeded.
3788967	3791089	But the technology is really important in my opinion.
3791789	3793451	The blind, not the deaf, he meant to say.
3795672	3802094	I get that and that's great and I do think the Kinect has made a lot of progress for accessibility issues.
3802114	3804475	It has had a lot of the iOS stuff that's come out lately.
3805555	3806455	Like Siri and all that.
3806635	3809676	But that's not what Microsoft's selling it as.
3811657	3815558	I kind of feel like Microsoft hasn't delivered on what they promised it to us as.
3815798	3822980	That's great, but just because that happens to be a great perk about it doesn't mean that
3823516	3837817	you know, Microsoft's really delivered on their promise of changing gaming you know, I don't know alright, anyhow, I guess we'll move on to some more news DarkSakura well how about something about the 3DS that might be good news
3839299	3840799	Super Mario 3D Land.
3841440	3843140	It's actually already out in Japan, I believe.
3844160	3846241	And they say that it's got new firmware for the system.
3847241	3856663	And it's basically supposed to make your friend list more functional so you can join in a friend's game that's already in progress just with pressing a button.
3857783	3864445	And it's actually just a brand new firmware system.
3865916	3867117	As opposed to the scheduled one, I think.
3867237	3871699	So now the 3DS is caught up to only being about six years behind in online gaming technology.
3873600	3874241	Something like that.
3874321	3875962	Well, it's good to see them making progress forward.
3876282	3877643	Yeah, a little progress.
3878443	3883026	But they're not sure if it's going to be out for the US one, but they're still waiting on hearing from Nintendo.
3884848	3885909	I would think it would be.
3885990	3890354	It is going to be on the US one, thanks to reviewers of the US copy already.
3891095	3898743	And not only does it do all that fancy stuff, it of course stops piracy.
3899344	3902467	You betcha that Skyward Sword on the Wii, when is that out by the way?
3902507	3903868	Is that out today or is that next week?
3903989	3905290	That's a while.
3905530	3906231	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3929833	3930474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3946025	3960878	well yeah I mean if you connect to even a system update stuff you're gonna you know get those but I don't think any of that's gonna really matter it usually they I mean they could I guess do that but I don't think that they're going to
3961338	3964059	In fact, I'm just kind of curious here.
3966039	3969320	Just see, I'm wondering if Skyward Sword's already leaked out.
3970521	3974882	On top of that, it's not like people aren't going to find another way.
3975782	3977023	So, I wouldn't be too worried.
3977723	3980864	Well, it's just one of those things I think is interesting, that's all.
3981411	3982251	Yeah, I mean, they could.
3982291	3983852	I mean, that'd be a good game for them to do it on.
3983932	3986172	I just, to be honest, though.
3986272	3987393	The PSP did that a lot.
3987413	3990033	To be honest with you, Rob, I don't think they give a shit anymore.
3990814	3991514	You think?
3991894	3992634	I don't think they care.
3993034	3995235	I think at this point they're like, okay, well, you've done enough.
3995255	3995895	Well, I don't know.
3995955	3996875	We got a story coming up.
3996935	3997275	I don't know.
3997435	3998015	I don't know, Loki.
3998035	3998416	We'll see.
3998636	4000016	I think they're already moved on to the Wii U.
4000256	4001497	We'll talk more about it when we get there.
4001877	4006880	I think you're wrong, and I was surprised to hear it too, but let's move on with the release dates.
4007680	4015005	We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out to a store near you, and as it is early November, there's going to be a lot, right, Loki?
4015285	4015625	Of course.
4016246	4025475	And as I was telling you before how Activision gets behind really stupid toy things for the DS, we have two of them actually coming out today.
4025915	4030339	Moshi Monsters, Moshling Zoo on Nintendo DS, and Lalalupsi.
4030539	4030779	What?
4031460	4032801	Yes, I don't understand what they are.
4032861	4036503	Wasn't Lala Loopsie one of the Tinky Winky or one of the Teletubbies?
4036723	4038424	No, it's not Teletubby.
4038644	4039785	Lala was a Teletubby.
4039885	4040545	Why do I know that?
4040725	4041386	Why do you know that?
4041426	4042506	I don't know why I know that.
4042987	4045488	My head's full of random trivia.
4046289	4052212	But yeah, so that is some weird toy that's popular nowadays, some loop doll things.
4052853	4053373	I don't know, whatever.
4053714	4057236	Anyways, let's cheer for Xbox 360 and Kinect.
4058477	4060419	There's a game that's for Kinect.
4061019	4065382	Metal Gear Solid HD Collection on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4067444	4070907	Ultimate Card Games by Telegames on Nintendo DS.
4071207	4071807	It's hilarious.
4071827	4073428	A little bit of trivia here.
4074249	4077552	This game is like one of the only games this company is making.
4077692	4079073	It's been delayed for four years.
4079393	4079833	Four years.
4079933	4080614	Four years.
4080934	4084155	and literally up till the last minute it keeps getting delayed.
4085616	4088057	Although they claim that it's actually going to release this week.
4088077	4089197	The hell's the problem?
4089498	4091018	It's just a stupid card game.
4091398	4094380	I don't understand how you develop a card game for four years.
4094440	4096661	And it's a part of a Game Boy Advance game.
4096761	4098081	It's one guy working there.
4098401	4099502	Seriously, it's one guy.
4100622	4102323	And he's been in the bathroom half the time.
4102901	4107282	Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey, and Gallop Racer on the Wii and PlayStation 3 this week.
4108262	4109482	Also, it was delayed at one point.
4110062	4114003	Get Up and Dance on the Wii and PlayStation 3 for the move.
4114603	4116024	Cars 2 on PSP.
4117244	4120064	Sony is so desperate for product on the PSP.
4120104	4123985	They're literally publishing the Disney Interactive game for the PSP.
4128146	4154941	because there's not a lot coming out on the PSP Bakugan Rise of the Resistance on Nintendo DS Self Defense Training Camp from Ubisoft on the Kinect Bass Pro Strike the bundle they have that coming out on the Wii and Little Big Planet Special Edition the Move Bundle like I was mentioning earlier that's coming out as well as the game by itself

4211857	4213759	Cartoon really needs its own game.
4213799	4214139	Wow.
4214199	4215620	That's on DS on the Wii.
4215921	4220884	And to go along with that, the perfect companion piece to that, Jaws the Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.
4221745	4223907	A game that you need to... Does it yet again have the niche?
4223927	4225228	You get to play as the shark.
4225328	4225808	Yes, it does.
4226269	4226489	Boy.

4277139	4280201	Otomedius, excellent on Xbox 360.
4280341	4282442	Excited, excited, excited.
4283242	4285464	That's also available in a collector's edition as well.
4285704	4288105	Aha, so there is something you're looking forward to this holiday season.

4447187	4447987	I have heard about this.
4448147	4455129	It's kind of like Guitaroo Man meets Anime Babes, kind of.

4458591	4459071	Yeah, yeah.
4459131	4459731	Okay, I got it.
4460532	4466298	On the Nintendo Wii this week, only Sengoku Basara 3 comes out on the Wii this week, as you know, the Wii's dying down a little bit.

4501405	4506567	This cheetah wants nothing to do with the rest of this cute fuckery that's going on in the rest of the picture.

4511490	4511930	Yeah.

4517192	4519333	Well, if you don't want to, DarkSakura, of course you do.
4519373	4519554	Do it.
4519754	4520174	Do it.
4520814	4522515	Put that on the Tumblr so listeners can see that.
4524096	4525356	I love angry cheetah.
4527537	4528098	Da yeah.
4529458	4531299	The damn thing will ever pull up.
4531579	4533080	Cheetah's saying to no.
4534081	4535662	All right, on the Sony PSP.
4535782	4536763	Oh, no, I already read PSP.
4536823	4537243	Herp derp.
4537663	4539344	That's it this week for releases then.
4539385	4540425	That's really it.
4542907	4545609	The Vita to look forward to on December 17th, though, in Japan.
4545649	4546689	Remember, they're getting it this year.
4548470	4551172	Before you get to Tumblr, how about the UK release date, StarSakra?
4551732	4554554	Well, give me a second.
4555135	4557796	Okay, on the 8th, we have... They changed everything on me.
4558057	4558497	How dare they?
4558977	4563261	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Fighting Fantasy The Warlock of Firetop Mountain Cave Story 3D L.A.
4563301	4564903	Noire The Complete Edition My Self-Defense Coach
4579917	4589427	and Shinobi, Black Eyed Peas Experience, Skyrim on 360 PC, PlayStation 3, Your Shape, Fitness Evolved 2012, and that's it.
4593214	4595836	Now I'm going to post stuff on my channel.
4623257	4624818	But a couple more news stories first.
4624878	4626419	Loki.
4626579	4626899	Yes.
4627439	4632402	So Nintendo, of course, they have a lot of patents for weird shit for the Wii and other systems.
4632942	4640926	This one is a device that's basically a touchpad attachment and looks as stupid as it pretty much could get.
4641166	4645208	It's basically this thing that looks like a periscope.
4646048	4674343	and it would attach to the bottom of or actually it looks like the top of the Wii Remote somehow and you would I guess interact with the Wii Remote's IR sensor using it would detect where your fingers are using this like mirror thing almost like using the infrared camera that's in the remote as like some sort of camera for your finger positions
4675323	4680165	So think of it like, you know, instead of looking at the infrared lights that are on the little sensor bar, it looks at your fingers.
4682045	4683326	But it looks so stupid.
4683946	4685647	Like, so, so very stupid.
4686787	4689148	But, neat, I guess?
4689228	4691609	I don't really know what this would be used for.
4692449	4696330	They're saying that it describes it like a mouse pointer or something like that.
4696890	4698611	But, man, it looks so stupid!
4698991	4700352	I mean, seriously.
4700533	4702654	Not ergonomically friendly at all.
4702735	4707719	This means that something's in the works for Nintendo that isn't Wii U, or is it?
4708039	4711502	Well, this, I guess, because the Wii U is going to be the same controller, so maybe it is.
4711603	4711943	Who knows?
4712123	4717048	It could be, but it looks like it folds down, too, so you don't have to use it all the time, but
4717748	4726671	Man, you know, that's kind of neat that you can use it as like a touchpad, but at the same time, I mean, Wii Remote navigates those menus just fine.
4726712	4729773	I don't think we really need to add more to it.
4732314	4732694	I don't know.
4734352	4734693	All right.
4735113	4742864	Well, also speaking of the Wii, and this is what I was referring to earlier, Loki, when I said, I don't know, they're swearing that there's more coming for the Wii.
4743986	4750935	Reggie Fils-Aimé was actually on records this week saying that Zelda Skyward Sword is not the last great game on the Wii.
4752176	4761239	In an interview with a Brazilian site, which was posted on the internet, he was asked the question, what's next for the Wii after Skyward Sword?
4761579	4763199	And he said, more good games.
4763600	4768121	Many people ask me if Zelda Skyward Sword is the last great game for the Wii, and the answer is no.
4768541	4772502	Let's talk about upcoming games for the Wii in late December or early January.
4772602	4774703	Cough, cough, after the holiday shopping season.
4775714	4798124	yeah let's talk about that this okay this could be just fucking fluff like it could be like whoopty shit Mario Tennis 27 or something you know like of course what's he gonna say sadly we don't have any good games coming out but we do have some great filler let's talk about you know thank you Reggie let's talk about what's coming out in December and January shall we
4798869	4800971	That's a great discussion topic right there.
4801632	4802934	Let's talk about what's coming on the Wii.
4803234	4807578	We have The Adventures of Tintin, a tie-in game to an animated movie.
4807719	4808239	No one care.
4808780	4810241	Hey, the French love Tintin.
4810682	4812383	And then we have... No one care.
4812484	4816428	Then we have, of course, the game from Nintendo themselves, Fortune Street.
4816608	4821433	Basically, like Mario Party, but with the Dragon Quest characters and the Mario characters in there.
4822476	4823057	DarkSakura.com
4831914	4836355	I mean, I'm sure there's some games coming out or something, but not anything notable.
4836555	4837155	For the Wii.
4837175	4838955	3DS maybe, but the Wii, no.
4838975	4840336	No, not even the 3DS.
4840356	4842276	Well, Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS.
4842856	4846797	And I also think that they have a version of Adventures of Tintin.
4847257	4852398	Actually, if you give me a couple seconds here, I can tell you exactly what's coming out.
4852418	4852618	1-1000, 2-1000.
4852638	4853718	Not literally a second there.
4859020	4862702	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, I haven't bought a game on the Wii in four years.
4863363	4865464	Actdeft says, I care about Tintin.
4866244	4866785	Yay for you.
4867445	4869266	This is me giving a fuck for you right now.
4871568	4873209	Tintin is awesome.
4873229	4876351	Techness in our chatroom says, it's not the last.
4876451	4877932	It's the only great game.
4878012	4878552	Just saying.
4880825	4883426	Yeah, I mean, it's... Thank you, SSJ100Matt.
4883726	4884986	I'm throwing shade at Tintin.
4885006	4886387	It has nothing to do with the movie.
4887147	4890068	It's just, you know the game is not going to be anything to scream about.
4890148	4890728	Let's be real.
4890808	4892689	How often are movie games that good?
4893189	4893649	Right?
4894249	4894689	Thank you.
4894749	4895910	They're not very good.
4897750	4898831	Um, okay.
4899191	4900832	Now, Alpha Kanatagram brings up a good point.
4900872	4908496	You're throwing shade at all this December and January stuff, but he said, let's meet up in December or January and then we'll talk.
4908596	4914899	Meaning that maybe they're announcing more plans in December for what's coming in January.
4915239	4922123	Which a lot of people are taking to mean, OMG, it's Last Story and Xenoblade and Pandora's Tower.
4923717	4924798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4942412	4943033	Oh, I'm sorry.
4943554	4946378	3DS also had Dr. Loric in The Forgotten Knights.
4946438	4948320	There's a Dr. Laura game coming on 3DS?
4948440	4949442	Dr. Loric.
4949782	4950543	Oh, Dr. Laura.
4950583	4953728	Dr. Loric and the complete knockoff of Professor Layton.
4955345	4957146	Oh, and National Geographic Challenge.
4957306	4958026	My mistake.
4958546	4959547	The Wii is saved.
4960867	4961968	The Wii is saved.
4962008	4969350	Speaking of release dates, Nintendo is on record that they are purposely holding back some of their upcoming 3DS games.
4969791	4973552	They're going to be releasing them in 2012 because it will maximize sales.
4973892	4976013	This actually makes sense though, to be honest.
4976033	4980114	You don't want to release everything right now because then the games are all diluted or whatever.
4980154	4981034	That's awesome.
4981154	4985635	I can't wait for what other Nintendo 64 game they're going to fucking port over to the 3DS.
4985695	4990057	Now hold on, hold on, because we know there's Luigi's Mansion 2.
4990797	4993178	We know there's the Kid Icarus game that they showed off.
4993198	4994518	Yes, Kid Icarus is coming.
4994658	4998219	And then wasn't there another big one that they had announced that got pushed back?
4998897	5000739	Who gives a crap about Luigi's Mansion?
5001079	5002640	The first one was kind of poo.
5003061	5003881	Kind of looks cool.
5004022	5004342	I don't know.
5005463	5006123	I won't spend $30 on it.
5006143	5009346	The only cool part was when you ran into the shadow that looked like it was hanging Luigi.
5009887	5015652	Well, maybe they've incorporated elements of Silent Hill and Luigi will be horribly murdered by some of the ghosts.
5016432	5017473	Somebody can dream anyway.
5018014	5018614	I'd pay for that.
5018874	5020216	Let me read you the quote here.
5020236	5021156	You want to hear something funny?
5021316	5021537	What?
5021817	5026441	There is absolutely no Wii games announced for January at this point.
5029475	5030675	Alright, let me see here.
5031236	5039963	For us to provide software titles one after another, one idea is, isn't it possible for Nintendo to stock some of its software titles instead of launching them as soon as the development is completed?
5040343	5051452	Video games need to stay fresh, so it is not practical for us to put them on hold for too long, but we think that some of them may be held for a certain amount of time so that there will be a short interval between when they are completed and when they are launched.
5051912	5054553	We are taking on this sort of challenge for the Nintendo 3DS.
5054913	5063336	For example, when we look at the software lineup for the year-end sales season, it is so dense that if we added any more software, the total sales would not increase.
5063716	5068458	Accordingly, we have intentionally delayed the launch of some software titles to early next year.
5069078	5070618	Again, I'm not surprised by this.
5072299	5073539	That's the strategy.
5073979	5078341	Most people buy the game the week it comes out or they don't buy it at all or they buy it used.
5082208	5082708	What, Loki?
5084609	5084949	Whatever.
5085469	5088809	I don't see that they're going to have any... It's going to be something retarded.
5089109	5095211	I'm sorry that they're going to put out... It's their last big game.
5095451	5095991	And you know what?
5096171	5103092	It's really not going to be any last big game because if it's really, really, really good, they're going to fucking port that shit to the Wii U. True.
5103933	5105633	Like they did with Zelda Twilight Princess.
5107310	5109614	So, I mean, I don't know.
5109715	5116567	Yeah, okay, Nintendo's got a few games coming out, but I don't think it's going to be anything like, oh my god, this is the greatest game I've ever played.
5118524	5125008	Still though, I gotta say, again, I've played Xenoblade, and it is pretty good, and it is ridiculous that that game is not out in the US.
5125128	5126389	There's no reason it shouldn't be out here.
5126409	5145601	There's a lot of games that they localize for Europe regions that, there was the one, it was Disaster Day and Crisis or something like that, that came out over in Japan, and it came out over in Europe, and they completely localized it, and it was Nintendo published, and they just, nah, we're not gonna bring it over here.
5145801	5146802	Let me ask this question.
5147967	5148527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5169978	5172721	Not porting these games I think could be seen as a bad decision.
5173261	5177406	The shareholders, very pissed off that they won't make iPhone games.
5177426	5178347	But here's the problem, though.
5178587	5180069	Who gives a fuck what the shareholders want?
5180089	5180930	They're stupid, okay?
5181310	5183092	I mean, no, no, no, hold on.
5183112	5185275	Loki, do you hear what you're saying?
5185635	5186436	Thank you for watching!
5202611	5204894	Let me help my competition.
5205655	5208238	Let's give people more reasons not to buy our systems.
5208258	5210081	We're going to put our games on other systems.
5210401	5211282	That's stupid.
5213085	5218813	The real answer is though, if the Wii U sucks, Nintendo is going to go the way of Sega.
5219605	5221006	They're not going to go the way of Sega.
5221026	5223667	They're going to lay low for a while and then come out with another system.
5223687	5229690	They're going to go the way they did with, like, Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, where it just didn't do that hot.
5230250	5231291	It'll survive.
5231391	5232231	People will buy it.
5232391	5234132	Because people eat up gimmicks.
5234412	5236213	That's why Skylanders is doing alright.
5236273	5238074	Because people eat up gimmicks.
5239155	5242296	And by doing well, I mean they've sold 20,000 copies per platform.
5242436	5243697	Which is not very well.
5244477	5245638	But, um...
5247259	5247599	I don't know.
5248320	5251541	I think though it's stupid if their shareholders want them to make iPhone games.
5251961	5258865	It's not stupid that they shouldn't have some cheaper priced games on their marketplace to drive sales that way.
5259325	5265308	And yeah, I do think they should get into a market where they have some 99 cent games because I think that's what people eat up.
5265989	5267890	And they're more likely to purchase that stuff.
5268910	5272172	Yeah, the quality might not be as good as your Nintendo games, but
5274381	5275481	I think that they're okay.
5275861	5276382	And you know what?
5276442	5278862	Some people like Angry Birds.
5279102	5281583	Actually, a lot of people like Angry Birds and that kind of stuff.
5281603	5282803	And those are 99 cent games.
5283463	5285984	Or even like Fruit Ninja.
5286584	5291806	Simple concept stuff that doesn't take much to develop and you sell it for a cheap price and people get addicted to that shit.
5292306	5293806	And you sell tons of download content.
5294526	5300228	But I think it's stupid for them to be expected to make iOS games.
5300268	5301108	That's just dumb.
5301536	5304797	But yeah, I could see them maybe coming out with some good games.
5305817	5311519	Honestly, the bring over, the last story and stuff like that, even though it's sometimes like, oh man, this is going to do really well.
5311579	5314380	All these hardcore fans are really into these games.
5314460	5315420	I think they missed the boat.
5315800	5316180	No, no.
5316320	5329865	I think that they've seen what these companies, like Mad World and stuff like that, these games that are appealing to the hardcore crowd, and they just don't make sense for them to bring over because to publish them, it's just expensive to bring it over here.
5329905	5330105	Now,
5331645	5342255	At the same time, I don't know why they've brought over some of the Dragon Quest games and stuff like that, because I think those are appealing to a hardcore audience, but I don't think they sell that well.
5342335	5344437	I mean, they're not selling millions of copies of these things.
5344897	5348821	All right, well, we're going to close with this thought here from our chatroom at chat.orangeonestradio.com.
5348941	5352344	Kaijudo says, Nintendo has been in the game too long to fall.
5352625	5353205	They'll be back.
5354366	5354767	We'll see.
5354987	5355247	All right.
5356168	5360672	Ironically enough, we're going to lead into the classic game of the week, which was picked before tonight's show.
5360732	5361833	Just keep that in mind.
5362754	5374504	A time when gaming life was simpler and, you know, we didn't have all this talk and podcasts that would be cynical about what the shareholders want and all that stuff for these companies.
5375461	5376482	We just played games!
5376682	5380505	When we were still in high school and would hide in our room and play it all day.
5380665	5385668	So DarkSakura, when you were in high school, what game did you go in and play all day?
5386149	5390672	Super Mario World, which I was so surprised we haven't done before.
5390692	5391692	I could have swore we did.
5391712	5392553	I thought we did too.
5392693	5396936	It did Super Mario World 2, which was Mario's island, wasn't it?
5397196	5397416	Yes.
5397697	5399658	Which was not nearly as fun as this one.
5399898	5401339	Yoshi's Island was... Yoshi's Island.
5401379	5402280	It was alright.
5403055	5404596	It had the stupid crying baby.
5405016	5405776	That was annoying.
5406416	5410137	So yeah, Super Mario World is the game.
5410257	5411358	Yay!
5411998	5414159	And it was subtitled as Super Mario Bros.
5414179	5415559	4 for the Japanese release.
5415859	5416739	I love this music.
5421361	5422561	This is my favorite music in the game.
5431280	5433481	This game had such great music.
5433501	5434782	And it was all done by Koji Kondo, too.
5434842	5435303	Did you know that?
5437504	5443428	It was, of course, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who is the man.
5444488	5450432	And it's basically Mario and Luigi have to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser.
5451173	5456056	And so they go all the way across these seven worlds to save Dinosaur Land.
5457056	5476766	and it had different power-ups in it like the cape and of course you still had the fire flower and you could ride Yoshi and Yoshi was awesome so anyway it was pretty much you know you had your overworld and you could go into the different levels and you had your super mushroom which is the other one I forgot to mention
5477706	5495471	Um, and then Yoshi had all these different powers, like if you got different colored Yoshis, like the purple Yoshi, if you swallowed a shell, he could just keep flying forever, and then if you, if he was red, then every time he ate a shell, he would burp fire, and then there was the yellow Yoshi, wasn't it, that had the stomp, wasn't it the stomp?
5496701	5496981	DarkSakura.com
5517924	5519745	Seriously, Jamie, we need to pick a day.
5520366	5529394	We need to figure out a way to stream to the interwebs from your house on the TVs and all that and just fucking play this, Guardian Legend, all the fucking games we love as kids.
5530615	5533357	And somehow ask people to donate and make it a charity thing.
5533397	5536239	Halfway through this game, you will hear me cuss up a fucking storm.
5537020	5538681	Because of the dirt level.
5538942	5539702	You know, where it has the...
5541103	5552872	and the, I call it the dirt level, when it has the shifting sand and you'll either get crushed to death or get caught in a wall or something and get crushed to death again.
5553652	5563239	So yeah, so anyway, basically you also, you go to Dinosaur Land and you're on vacation and Peach gets kidnapped and
5563779	5564600	As usual.
5565400	5568142	And so they find an egg and they meet Yoshi.
5569342	5572604	And they find out that evil turtles have imprisoned everybody.
5574525	5583510	So basically, if you haven't played this game, get out from under the rock you've been hiding under and go freaking play it because it's awesome.
5583710	5584571	I love the end of it.
5584611	5588433	And it's Mode 7-tastic, the fight with Bowser.
5589818	5591860	And man, there was just so much to do in this game.
5591940	5592940	It was so much fun.
5593841	5595142	I really can't get over it.
5595162	5596964	And there were different ways to end each level.
5597584	5603369	You could get the key, and you would put the key in the keyhole, and the keyhole would get huge and then eat you.
5604710	5611615	And you could climb up the beanstalks like you could in the original Super Mario Bros.
5611695	5612416	and Mario Bros.
5612776	5612416	3.
5613737	5617700	And you had the ghost houses that had the booze in them.
5618180	5619021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5645916	5649718	Yeah, you know, the PlayStation was damn near the CD-ROM for the Super Nintendo.
5649798	5652899	Yeah.
5653139	5658301	I really think that this game makes the best use of the music synthesizer in the system.
5658541	5659442	I really do think so.
5662263	5666144	You also have the P-blocks that would change your thing and change the type of ending that you get.
5666204	5666885	All kinds of stuff.
5666905	5667445	It's so much fun.
5668285	5669086	And the Star Road.
5670226	5672908	The Star Road was sparkly and freaking hard.
5673468	5675289	Because you had three different ways to beat the Star Road too.
5675309	5675989	It was crazy.
5676369	5677550	So yeah, so re-releases.
5677650	5681672	There was Super Mario All-Stars came out and it had this packaged with it.
5682092	5686915	Which is basically the exact same version as what came on the SNES anyway.
5687836	5693884	Um, however, a little bit of difference in it is that Luigi had his own sprite.
5694304	5695105	So that's kind of neat.
5695866	5700192	Um, Super Mario World came out, um, on the Virtual Console as well.
5701194	5701774	And, uh...
5703464	5706206	Super Mario Advance 2 Super Mario World
5724762	5738267	The interesting thing, too, about Mario World 2 is that even though it was so different and on paper it sounds terrible that they made all these changes, it really stands on its own as another great fucking 2D game.
5738508	5740708	It's the same game, just with a little bit of tweaks.
5740748	5741989	It's an outstanding game.
5742309	5743930	Yeah.
5744090	5748992	And they also changed Luigi sprites to make it a little bit closer to the Mario Advance style.
5750472	5752933	Like I said, Koji Kondo did the music.
5755493	5758634	And he also did all the variations on it.
5758694	5764236	So there was like the waltz version of the music that played slower in the caves.
5765196	5766616	The underwater version.
5766856	5767716	All kinds of different ones.
5767836	5775178	And he basically... And when you ride on Yoshi, the soundtrack on the levels have bongo drums.
5775198	5776158	Did you hear that?
5776198	5778259	Yeah, you can hear it in the background right now, actually.
5783829	5787510	Yeah, I always thought that was awesome how the music changed, depending on if you were on Yoshi or not.
5788431	5790612	Can I read a quick comment from our chatroom?
5790752	5792892	It was a TigerClaw on chat talking about Mode 7.
5793273	5796634	I remember when you fight Bowser at the end, he does that thing where he flies towards the screen.
5796654	5799435	That was pretty cool back then, so we got an early taste of Mode 7.
5799855	5802316	Oh yeah, that last boss fight was epic.
5803136	5805137	Yeah, but really easy.
5805617	5806678	It was really easy.
5806958	5812920	But you spend the whole game challenge to get there, but sort of the last boss fight is more of a relief.
5813857	5814077	Yeah.
5814838	5816319	I mean, and it's not a short fight.
5817099	5817860	You just have to have good timing.
5817880	5818580	It wasn't multiple phases.
5818600	5822122	And the part where the little thing he's riding starts bouncing does get kind of hard.
5822162	5831668	But, I mean, yeah, at that point, like, if you're good enough in the game to get to that point, then it's, um... Oh, I loved the, um, scary house music.
5831689	5832269	I had to turn it up.
5838559	5839741	And the fence?
5839821	5841724	Oh my god, I love the fence stuff.
5842225	5844468	And that was in all of the commercials too, remember?
5844488	5845870	This game is so fucking good.
5846391	5848694	And you can punch through them in the face through the fence.
5851690	5852771	That was so awesome.
5852871	5854152	I loved punching them in the face.
5854172	5855833	Oh god, I totally forgot about the fence parts.
5855873	5857554	And then the flip around ones.
5857734	5860376	I know, I know, I know.
5861277	5867821	So, how about we get into some of the other little stuff that has to do with this.
5868362	5869763	How about Asshole Mario?
5869783	5871684	Do you remember Asshole Mario?
5871784	5873245	I remember Asshole Mario.
5873285	5874926	Is there a YouTube I can pull up of that real quick?
5874986	5875727	I'm sure there is.
5875887	5877008	It won't matter because they won't see.
5877028	5878569	You'll have to Tumblr it or something.
5878729	5881851	Well, look up one of the music Mario World.
5883012	5886535	Because, um... Or you can just keep playing, I don't care.
5886875	5887555	Oh, the Thwomps.
5887836	5888416	Those are awesome.
5889116	5889637	Um, okay.
5890297	5896822	So, Asshole Mario is basically, um, ROM hacks of Super Mario World.
5897342	5902006	Where it's not impossible, but it's freaking terrible.
5902526	5932266	because you have to have perfect timing and be able to cut out so short but you really have to be careful and have your timing perfect and you keep dying over and over and over again you just have to have a million men to get through it but yeah if you want to see an exercise in futility look up Asshole Mario and then there's another one where people would basically have I think it's like an autoplay is what it was called the Mario autoplays
5933366	5940470	where they actually have where all you do is you start the level and Mario will start walking on his own.
5940970	5943191	You basically do it through means of an auto-scroll level.
5943911	5945152	Oh, that shit was funny.
5945272	5948433	Yeah, look up autoplay, I think is what it is.
5949033	5957137	It would play rhythm along with whatever the music was in the background level.
5957177	5958097	I think this is one, isn't it?
5959978	5961879	This YouTube's called Super Mario Auto-Run.
5963695	5966078	It has some weird music in the background.
5966219	5967600	Yeah, it's doing it to different music.
5967621	5971866	Can you turn that up just a little bit?
5971946	5972367	Okay.
5987628	5989889	Put that on the Tumblr so people can see that.
5990109	5991590	Yeah, that's the first one I ever saw.
5992251	5999635	By the way, that's what we're using Tumblr for now is that all these little things we see during the show, that way you podcast-y listeners can go back and have it all in one place.
6000276	6013781	Yeah, but basically they'll take music and they'll set the game autoplaying to all of this stuff and just the amount of time and thought and rhythm that goes into this is just absolutely baffling.
6013821	6015702	These people have no lives, but it's really cool.
6016002	6018583	SSJ100, Matt, link to Asshole Mario in the chat room.
6018743	6019623	Cool, I'll link that too.
6019643	6021484	I just want to remember how fucking terrible this is.
6022704	6023425	Asshole Mario.
6024805	6029527	It's like you just start to feel sorry for these people after a while because it's like
6033650	6037411	I swear, there's been times when I've watched those and I just want to go, oh, I'm so sorry.
6037551	6038291	Oh, I'm so sorry.
6038391	6042072	And then feel like crying because you can feel like it's happening to you.
6042292	6045553	No, I'm laughing because this stage just starts out right off the bat.
6045613	6046633	Bullet Bill in your face.
6049113	6051114	If you're not ready for it, it's going to get you.
6052850	6053691	It's crazy.
6054351	6055692	Anything else that you were going to say about this?
6055852	6060514	No, it's just that Super Mario World is awesome, and it's clearly created such a legacy, you know?
6060795	6061155	Oh, yeah.
6061795	6066618	So, I'd say it's well worthy of being our classic game of the week.
6066918	6071481	If Mario 3D World is half as good as Super Mario World, it'll be a great purchase.
6071961	6072441	For real.
6073322	6073502	So...
6074303	6076607	Alright, your classic game of the week, Super Mario World.
6076687	6078651	A true, true, true classic.
6078831	6080154	I mean, like, the classic.
6080695	6084021	And just shocked as hell that that has never come up before.
6084362	6085144	So, what a find.
6085615	6089877	Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
6090057	6090777	We're not done yet.
6090817	6091938	There's still half a show to come.
6092178	6093799	We've got plenty of news to talk about still.
6094059	6098501	Your emails are coming up, the FUs of the week, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
6099241	6106364	Much more news in the second half of the show, including, I find this crazy, which PopCap game might they be making an arcade machine out of?
6106905	6108245	That could be something else, huh?
6108925	6114308	Rapid fire news and all that fun stuff when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6120256	6122737	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6122777	6135321	We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 6th of 2011 with the second half of episode number 434 live tonight as we are every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
6135801	6139983	We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
6140243	6140903	We love Bobby.
6141003	6147405	He's one guy doing an NPR-ish style show where he talks about games and has live call-ins as well and so forth.
6147665	6149466	And one thing he was talking about... Except without being boring.
6150166	6150987	He's not boring.
6151027	6151767	Not at all.
6151987	6156430	It's like one of those really thrilling NPR shows like Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me or something like that.
6156450	6156930	Those exist?
6157310	6157631	Yes.
6157911	6159072	They have some fun podcasts.
6159092	6159852	You should check it out.
6160252	6166696	But anyway, one thing that Bobby was talking about on his show tonight that I guess it's coming up a little later in our show so I apologize.
6166736	6179764	I'm stepping on it a little bit but maybe Loki can find another story to fill in for it because I want to talk about this and that's the Mass Effect 3 beta that came out and I guess some things are being reported out of that whole Mass Effect 3 beta that there's going to be new modes
6179964	6180404	in the game.
6180905	6184126	That there's not just going to be like a normal mode, right?
6184386	6192351	But that there'll be a mode in the game that focuses more on the combat features and then a mode that focuses more on the RPG and dialogue features.
6192791	6197434	And I gotta admit, I'm not usually a Mass Effect fan, but I find that shit really exciting.
6197934	6204317	Like, you know, I... Combat's okay, but I'm way more into the story elements and all of that.
6204357	6208660	So if there's like an RPG only mode, like, I'm really excited about that.
6208760	6209180	Loki would...
6209560	6211424	Do you think that's good for the game?
6211744	6212766	For the series or what?
6213848	6214149	Sure.
6214509	6215631	Probably won't pick it up anyways.
6216209	6217870	You get it anyways, just because?
6217970	6218850	No, I will not get it.
6218870	6219630	Oh, you're not going to get it?
6219670	6219990	Why not?
6220030	6221151	You're just not a fan of Mass Effect?
6221211	6222531	No, I'm not a fan of Mass Effect.
6223091	6224992	I'm not either, but I find that really interesting.
6225272	6229333	I mean, and to be honest, I'm not hating because I think the games are bad.
6229393	6237156	It's just, again, there's only so many games that a person can play at a time, and I just never got into Mass Effect 1 or 2 as much as other people loved them.
6237456	6242078	I watched somebody play 1, and I was kind of like, it doesn't really look like something I'd be into.
6243819	6258975	I've enjoyed other Bioware games I've played like Dragon Age, so who knows Alright, well let's get into some rapid fire news We're going to cover some news stories really quickly Because there was quite a bit of news this week It is a busy time of year Loki, we'll start with you
6260033	6263694	Capcom believes that Resident Evil Revelations is going to be worth $50.
6264354	6267874	And that's $10 more than your regular 3DS game.
6267914	6274275	In fact, even Nintendo games like Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 are only going to be $40.
6275056	6276516	But Capcom thinks, hey, you know what?
6276916	6281017	Resident Evil Revelations should be $50.
6283897	6288578	And it will support the Circle Pad, which will be coming out here later on for another $20.
6289944	6296989	and, you know, and they did, they were quick to point out, yes, you can reset your save game this time.
6297970	6299271	Oh, well, thank you, Capcom.
6299331	6299911	Thank you so much.
6299931	6301512	That was very gracious of you to let us do that.
6301973	6304174	And here's the reasoning why they need the extra $10.
6304594	6309998	A true console experience on a handheld device is what Resident Evil Revelations is.
6310539	6316623	It's also going to be, it requires a 4 gigabyte cartridge resulting in a higher price point.
6317768	6321710	Yes, because those extra gigabytes are more expensive.
6322150	6335195	You know, I don't know what cartridges cost, but I know when it comes to flash memory, an extra four gigs on flash memory, four versus eight, like a few bucks, a couple dollars.
6336815	6338616	Flash memory is really cheap, Capcom.
6339016	6339716	I'm not buying it.
6340937	6341977	Really, I'm not buying it.
6342157	6343978	I'm not going to buy your game at all.
6346488	6348349	So, yeah.
6348689	6350530	And, of course, if you're interested, it comes out in February.
6351671	6357174	Of course, there's going to be a new Rainbow Six game coming from Ubisoft, I'm sure.
6357734	6367960	While it's probably a ways away, but Rainbow Six Patriots, outed by the new Game Informer cover, is going to be kind of a game that deals with, you know...
6370062	6376552	Terrorism set in our own country and kind of like homegrown terrorists, I guess.
6379477	6383244	No real details, but obviously they're saying there's a lot of, you know...
6385499	6392523	Splits in a lot of... The word's escaping me now.
6393764	6397246	Basically, a lot of different narrative directions, they said.
6398287	6400108	Tactics and realism.
6400148	6403110	They kind of go in the whole double... What was it?
6403130	6406972	The last conviction route, I guess, the Splinter Cell game.
6407412	6409234	More realistic and gritty versus...
6410174	6410755	Thanks for watching!
6429568	6433654	I did play a lot of Ghost Recon stuff so it should be interesting to have to check it out I guess.
6446505	6450471	I think Dan played a little bit of that and he liked it, of Rainbow Six, the last one.
6451732	6463469	And not surprisingly, with all the Kinect hacks out there, Microsoft is actually thinking about marketing Kinect for PC and Kinect for Windows is going to be the new marketing campaign, I guess.
6463949	6467032	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6486753	6488055	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6504214	6515420	I understand that, but maybe they could adapt the Kinect camera to have it like, okay, there's going to be one that's like, I'm sitting in front of my laptop versus I'm sitting eight feet away from my laptop.
6515480	6516001	Yeah, true.
6516561	6529609	And for some of the accessibility reasons that Salacious Pop had brought up in a chat comment earlier, I could see where Kinect getting built into the PCs would be more useful than what we think of in our minds right now when we think of Kinect like Dance Central.
6530444	6530664	you know.
6530884	6531104	Yeah.
6532685	6532885	So.
6533605	6533986	It'd be neat.
6534666	6536307	Especially some of the voice commands and things like that.
6536647	6544850	Especially with some of the early stuff of Windows 8 where you see that it's going to have a mode that's very dashboard like or tablet like.
6544870	6546151	I'm sure you've all seen that.
6546491	6546951	Yeah.
6547131	6547911	It'd be interesting.
6549112	6550453	So the Kinect could control that.
6550833	6557776	Well I can see yeah definitely because the Kinect controls that already in the new dashboard so they could just adapt it exactly the same way.
6558136	6558336	True.
6558356	6558436	True.
6560370	6560951	Techland Dead World
6577411	6580094	Did pretty well, came out at a good time, and a lot of people were into this.
6580154	6584179	So going from island to the whole damn world makes a lot of sense.
6584399	6588244	So we'll see more on that probably at E3 next year if it ends up that it's legit.
6588624	6590767	Or maybe they're just trademarking it just in case.
6591027	6593670	You never know, but usually these things end up being in the game.
6593870	6596814	Yeah, I might imagine that they're making a sequel to a popular game.
6597134	6603178	Walmart's getting its own game magazine, which game magazines do pretty well for stores if GameStop is any indication.
6603558	6610583	But what's interesting is that the folks behind it is going to be EGM Media, of course, Electronic Gaming Monthly.
6610923	6613565	The new magazine will be called Walmart Game Center.
6613605	6615146	They're not saying it's going to be monthly.
6615206	6617388	They just say, quote, regular frequency.
6617948	6624753	So maybe that's just monthly during the busy periods and twice every other month or whatever during the not-so-busy periods.
6624773	6625073	Who knows?
6626474	6632477	It's going to have news, previews, interviews, and other exclusive stories on gaming culture and the most important game releases.
6632517	6635318	In other words, pretty much the same shit you can get on the internet right away.
6635819	6637880	So it's making it very difficult for magazines right now.
6637980	6647565	But if they can get the good exclusives and takes on gaming culture, certainly it could give GameStop some competition.
6647605	6652248	And although I'm not a big Walmart fan either, I'm all for giving GameStop a little competition, eh?
6653328	6660754	They are going to offer this on personal computers, iPad, and Facebook with what's called the Screen Paper Publishing Platform.
6660794	6662675	I guess that's a proprietary thing to EGM.
6663075	6670041	Very interesting to me that it's not on the iPod or iOS, iPad magazine thing they have now.
6670061	6672082	Because you can get Retro Gamer now on your iPhone.
6672102	6672543	Did you know that?
6672583	6674924	It's all part of that newsstand thing that came out in the new iOS.
6675565	6680889	Granted, you have to pay five bucks an issue or whatever it costs normally on the newsstand, but it is, you know,
6681564	6682045	DarkSakura.com
6698443	6699584	I can totally tell you that.
6699864	6701346	Now, I think this is funny.
6701406	6704148	This is a very tongue-in-cheek, very sordid game.
6704188	6713155	It's an indie game that just came out on Xbox Live Indie Games, and the indie game developer is Ben Kane.
6714296	6718880	It's called DLC Quest, and I love this trailer, so I'm going to play a little bit for you guys.
6718900	6720301	Maybe we'll get it on the Tumblr, too.
6721302	6724704	Going Loud Studios put this out, and here's the trailer.
6724844	6726626	DLC goes to
6730575	6737057	DLC Quest Basic features are now DLC Pausing the game?
6737677	6740617	DLC Quest Animation?
6741358	6744818	DLC Quest Moving to the left?
6745699	6748919	Well, that's included No, it's not!
6749360	6750820	DLC Quest
6751701	6753782	Collect coins, then buy DLC.
6754382	6754982	It's simple.
6755963	6759685	DLC means Downloadable Content, and Quest means Quest.
6760285	6761705	DLC Quest.
6762346	6770229	We got map packs, night map packs, sexy outfits, hats, and zombies.
6770949	6772910	Yeah, we even got horse armor.
6773511	6774911	DLC Quest.
6775852	6778273	Uh, I think there's a princess or something to rescue too.
6779393	6779954	I don't know.
6780614	6780955	F*** you.
6781675	6783997	DLC Quest is made with satire.
6784537	6789441	Satire means the use of humor, irony, and saturation or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity.
6790042	6791423	DLC Quest.
6792124	6793745	Download it now!
6795939	6796900	See, now I thought that was funny.
6797260	6798781	It was funny.
6798901	6799382	Here's the thing.
6800062	6807068	The satire part is, and what you can't see unless you're actually looking at the video, is that the guy is walking around collecting coins in a very Mario-esque kind of game.
6807448	6816095	So the quote-unquote DLC is that you're using these coins you pick up to get the ability to move to the left and get sexy princess outfits and horse armor and all this stuff.
6816555	6818997	I think that's funny, and it is pretty good satire.
6819017	6819837	What did you think of that, Loki?
6819857	6821158	I don't think I've seen that before.
6821419	6821659	What?
6821979	6822479	It's pretty funny.
6822499	6823180	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
6823280	6824621	So I don't know how much that costs.
6824661	6825562	I didn't see... Oh!
6826302	6827283	80 Microsoft points.
6827703	6828104	A buck.
6828684	6829505	Good for you, dude.
6830025	6830646	A whole dollar.
6831106	6832467	I think you'll sell some copies with that.
6833288	6833728	Why not?
6834128	6834529	Why not?
6835189	6835830	Good for you, dude.
6836951	6838352	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6839226	6867949	a couple things actually new Xbox Live Arcade game is Alan Wake it's going to be available for Xbox Live Arcade and it was announced on their Facebook page and it's not a sequel it is the game also there is a country music pack for Rock Band 3 that's got a lot of crap in it and I mean crap because I hate country music it's called Going Country Pack 5 it's Shelly Wright's
6868049	6870873	But couldn't you call stuff like Sweet Home Alabama country music?
6870993	6871934	No, Southern Rock.
6872014	6872555	There's a difference.
6872995	6873596	Oh, sorry.
6873716	6874117	My bad.
6875539	6876920	There's some decent stuff in here.
6877000	6879002	Like The Night the Lights Went On in Georgia.
6879062	6879603	It's Reba.
6879623	6880443	You can't, you know.
6881304	6882205	There's Sugarland.
6882845	6884767	There's also Going Country Pack 6.
6884947	6887949	That's Billy Currington, whoever the crap that is.
6888410	6889110	George Strait.
6889270	6889751	I mean, hey.
6890111	6891292	Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire.
6892173	6893454	Justin Moore, who cares.
6894154	6895415	Going Country Pack 7.
6895556	6896476	Dude, Johnny Cash.
6896556	6897177	Keith Urban.
6897377	6897597	Hey.
6897998	6898778	Lady Antebellum.
6899679	6900379	Merle Haggard.
6900740	6902041	Now Merle Haggard's pretty awesome.
6902421	6905406	and Going Country Pack 8 has Dwight Yoakam and Rascal Flatts.
6906187	6910955	Going Country Mega Pack, all of the above and all the other stuff I didn't say and it's 20 bucks.
6911727	6918912	It almost makes you think that at some point they were going to do a country rock band release and didn't end up doing it because they had like all these songs.
6918932	6919512	This is a lot.
6919532	6921794	They did two country rock band track packs.
6921854	6923635	Yeah, they did the track packs a while ago.
6923695	6926037	I guess maybe this is just a virtual version of that.
6926097	6926457	I don't know.
6926517	6930059	The only one of those I care about is Johnny Cash because Ring of Fire is awesome.
6930079	6933101	Yeah, Johnny Cash is above country music.
6933421	6934522	He's godly music.
6936463	6938645	And then Ring of Fire was in the Silent Hill movie.
6939400	6940021	SILENT HILL
6957538	6963083	There actually is talk that Silent Hill may be going off into different spin-offs.
6965405	6973992	I haven't really said exactly what, but there's been mentions of maybe an RPG or a first-person shooter.
6974770	6975951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7001364	7003407	It says, Downpour was never going to be an FPS.
7003507	7007751	This was just the result of some overzealous fans reading too much into a posting on Vatcher's website.
7009173	7010815	How about make Silent Hill cool again?
7011616	7012136	Seriously.
7012256	7012696	Bastards.
7012756	7014077	Force Akira Yamaoka to come back.
7014197	7016278	Throw a lot, a lot, a lot of money at him.
7017018	7017678	That's what you could do.
7018339	7019039	And grovel.
7019179	7019739	Groveling helps.
7020259	7024101	Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangecountry.com.
7024121	7026342	A lot on the country pack of the DarkSakura I mentioned a minute ago.
7026922	7030203	Brad from PodCulture says, when is this country pack due out or did I miss it?
7031324	7032124	Did you say the date?
7033124	7033765	No, I didn't.
7034005	7035965	It's this upcoming week, right?
7035985	7036586	Yeah, I think so.
7037626	7039787	So, that'll be out very, very soon.
7039827	7041408	It's not like something like Way in the Future.
7041548	7042689	It is, I just pulled it up.
7042769	7045650	November 8th is when this is all out.
7045730	7046450	Going to other comments.
7046890	7049752	Legend of Zaku says, needs more achy, breaky heart.
7050852	7051313	Please no.
7051673	7052713	Unless we have the Weird Al version.
7052753	7053734	We need a Weird Al pack.
7054274	7055274	That would be awesome, actually.
7056315	7058756	He's going to be in Oakland in a couple days, or maybe it was tonight.
7059436	7060017	Damn.
7061017	7062638	If there's no writing going on or anything like that.
7063348	7063748	Let's see.
7064889	7069775	Tiger Claw says, going country, will there be other genres like going dance, going rave?
7071077	7075843	As neat as that idea is, keep in mind it is going to have to make use of all the instruments somehow.
7076243	7077785	Now there are some...
7078846	7107770	songs that you know will exclude a keyboard or a bass but keep in mind it's going to be really hard to do a dance pack unless it has guitars but like they could do like cnc music factory everybody dance now because i had that i guess they could probably get creative and figure something out we'll see all right uh let's move on to some more news before we get to the mailbag and the f us of the week and your calls pretty soon here loki
7108792	7108972	Yes.
7109612	7124455	Now, one of the features of the PlayStation 3 has been to allow people the ability to share content, or at least you can link your content that you download to up to five different PS3s.
7124956	7131117	I would imagine that's if, for example, you own multiple PS3s, or, for example, if you have a PS3 that...
7132798	7138762	and you want to bring that content to the new PS3 and they figure that you're not probably going to go through five PS3s.
7139142	7141423	Well, people have been using that to share games.
7141544	7151150	So say, for example, I download a game and I can share it with four of my friends because they all download it to their console using that sharing feature kind of...
7152751	7154232	Exploiting, if you will.
7154832	7162315	Well, beginning on November 18th, PlayStation Network licenses can only be tied to two PS3s and two PSPs.
7163395	7168297	Apparently they're saying that that's going to affect purchases made after the start date.
7168978	7178282	And while you'll be able to deactivate and reactivate consoles online, the days of sharing with a bunch of people is now gone.
7178722	7179142	And so...
7180931	7182333	Honestly, I think that's fair.
7182413	7195669	I mean, because people were kind of abusing it to begin with to get free games, and if you can deactivate consoles, like, say, for example, your console dies or whatever, and you can reactivate it on a new console, I think that's fair enough.
7196350	7197732	So, yeah.
7198753	7199373	Go Sony.
7199613	7202335	I'm kind of not surprised they're clamping down on it.
7202415	7210502	Five did seem excessive and they're probably privy to all these people that have formed these little clubs about sharing the codes and so forth or sharing the content.
7210562	7211702	So I'm not too surprised.
7212263	7214104	Two seems reasonable.
7214404	7217307	One downstairs, one upstairs or one in the bedroom, one in the living room.
7217327	7219008	Well, and the fact that you can deactivate them too.
7219048	7221350	I don't know if you could deactivate the ones when it's five.
7222130	7222670	Oh, good point.
7223431	7225852	So that would be, I think that's fair.
7225872	7229013	That would be good if you fry one PS3 and you have to get another one.
7229053	7232395	You can add it onto that and deactivate it once you get the new one.
7232935	7233335	Very true.
7234176	7238137	So that's good and not too surprising that they've clamped down on that.
7238157	7240038	But again, that's not retroactive, right?
7240078	7243400	So any old games you've already bought are under the 5 license.
7243740	7245741	So the clubs aren't really getting shut down.
7246301	7248742	It's just, you know, you're not going to be able to do it much longer.
7249102	7249322	Yeah.
7250002	7256165	Well, here's one of the games that you won't be sharing with five different people, which is too bad because it's going to be a pretty big party game.
7256665	7260826	Now, if you've ever played this card game at a party, you know how much fun it can be.
7261186	7262127	Apples to Apples.
7262167	7262947	Have you ever played this?
7263307	7263707	Love it.
7263907	7264167	Yes.
7264288	7270050	This is the game where you have a card on a green card, and the green card is some type of, like, verb.
7270510	7274171	Like, I don't know, like... It's usually an adjective, I think.
7274271	7275432	Yeah, like an adjective.
7275752	7275952	Like...
7276832	7277232	Tasty.
7277472	7278172	Yeah, Tasty.
7278473	7287896	And then the red cards all have nouns on them, like the 90s, or the card that will always win every round, including Tasty, you put down Helen Keller.
7288436	7289896	Always wins the round, right?
7290197	7293258	And then because everybody votes on which card is the funniest for that.
7293578	7300200	Well, this game is going to be coming out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this holiday season.
7300640	7301981	I'm going to play the shit out of this.
7302002	7307027	THQ is doing it and apparently they're going to be adding this social and online connectivity.
7307687	7310550	You're going to be able to play this anywhere, anytime.
7311892	7318078	It's going to be interesting to see how it works because it's not going to be the same online that it is in person.
7318558	7323003	Or that it is drunk on pineapple Malibu in the hotel room.
7323396	7326538	There will be single, local, and six-player online play.
7326898	7328559	You're going to have golden Apple cards.
7328579	7329900	How do you play single player?
7330560	7331521	That's kind of dumb, huh?
7331941	7335263	Golden Apple cards, which will be used to change the rules.
7335663	7337885	There's going to be Facebook support as well.
7338405	7339986	Download content, of course.
7340306	7343368	More cards and all the same stuff you saw in Uno.
7343608	7346190	800 Microsoft points, $9.99 on PlayStation 3.
7346910	7349712	And the game will be expanding to Facebook and so forth later on.
7351231	7358100	God, I love the party game, but online, if I'm not playing with friends, I don't know how this is going to be much fun.
7358320	7359782	With strangers, it's going to be stupid.
7360643	7361124	You know what I mean?
7361765	7362786	You know what would be awesome?
7363227	7363387	What?
7364614	7365414	What was it?
7366415	7367515	Eat Poop, You Cat?
7368795	7371156	Oh, yeah, God, explain that game real quick.
7371556	7372116	That's a fun game.
7372296	7378378	Eat Poop, You Cat is basically a visual telephone, I guess.
7378518	7382540	You start off by writing a phrase, and you pass it to the next person.
7382600	7389882	They draw a picture of that phrase, and then you basically obscure the original phrase, and the next person tries, they write a phrase...
7390322	7391363	Thanks for watching!
7413158	7436635	but yeah Apples to Apples will be interesting it would be cool like and if this is what they're talking about I'm not sure but like if the Xbox can play Facebook that might be interesting because it'll make it way more likely that you could actually play your friends but I'm not I don't know I'm not giving them that much credit that seems kind of complicated but it would be really cool if they can get that to work somehow so there you go Apples to Apples coming soon
7437495	7439116	Let's go to our mailbag.
7439557	7444901	Every week you guys send us emails and DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads them.
7445662	7449384	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
7449925	7450505	We got a few.
7450906	7452507	Alright, good, because we were off a week.
7452627	7452827	A few.
7454929	7457471	So first off, hey guys, Moulton Brown here.
7458051	7461594	I heard you talking about rugby games last week and I felt I had to chime in.
7462074	7465096	I've been playing rugby for six years now and it is awesome!
7465797	7471781	I am really happy with the increase in rugby games this year considering how popular the sport is worldwide.
7472321	7476784	Regarding the increase, I may be because the Rugby World Cup is going on right now.
7477785	7481788	I would say more, but I'm not feeling well, so I'm just going to peace out, later Molten Brown.
7508291	7508652	DragCave.net
7526831	7528892	Any tips if you guys have played it?
7529052	7531413	It strikes me as a much nicer sort of Neopets.
7531673	7532453	That's from Holly.
7532594	7535115	I was just about to say, I'm hearing Neopets.
7535595	7536315	But interesting.
7536355	7540357	So it's something you put it in your signature and you get a lot of clicks and people hatch it.
7541037	7545859	That's a good get people on our website scheme.
7548180	7548880	It's kind of smart.
7549140	7549640	Yeah, it is.
7549660	7550781	No, I've never played it.
7550941	7551621	I looked at the site.
7551641	7552401	It looks kind of neat.
7552501	7553342	But no, I haven't tried it.
7553442	7553722	Sorry.
7554042	7557269	Sorry, yeah, I can't say a whole lot on that, but I'll have to look at it.
7558699	7559559	We got one from Robaba.
7560260	7560640	Robaba!
7561381	7568848	The Paranormal Pinball Table is apparently free on Xbox Live Arcade this week with only a few days left when you broadcast.
7568968	7571530	Zen Pinball on PSN has had it for months.
7572091	7578937	I know the narrator of the game is supposed to be a Sam Spade soundalike, but it is clearly the actor who voices Peter Griffin on The Family Guy.
7579317	7579678	Oh my.
7580078	7584302	Still, it's a fun table that may be guilty of trying to do too many things at once.
7584742	7589443	Wait, isn't Peter Griffin the creator of the show?
7589663	7608529	Yeah, Peter, it's Seth MacFarlane I don't think they would have got him to do a video game They must just sound really similar I'm looking at the table itself, just for a moment And it kind of seems to me like, yeah, it's trying to be sort of like Twilight Zone Although the ramps are crazy on it, wow
7610089	7611349	Yeah, I'm pissed I forgot to get this.
7611369	7617491	It's probably like a knockoff of Twilight Zone versus Whodunit, you know.
7618291	7623792	Anyway, okay, we have one from, I'm just, oh, it's from CD Thunder, okay.
7624193	7629774	Hey, OLR, I went to the mall recently and played in the game room for a while.
7630214	7634155	During my visit, I noticed that two of my favorite games were gone, Carnival and House of the Dead.
7634475	7635955	At least you have a game room still.
7636336	7638196	Yeah, at least you have an arcade with actual games.
7638536	7639497	and I'll see you next time.
7663624	7665345	The whole sale of arcade games too.
7666665	7667826	What's that place at the Metreon?
7667866	7669566	Tilt was selling a bunch of games.
7669646	7670947	Usually they are going to be a couple hundred dollars.
7671187	7681572	Keep in mind, dude, you got just a whole game console slash television slash stand-up cabinet slash fancy controller all dedicated to one game.
7681632	7682872	That does cost a couple hundred bucks.
7682892	7683793	You can look at Craigslist.
7683813	7686814	You can find a lot of old arcade games for that kind of price.
7688415	7689635	Cabinets are about that price.
7689935	7691336	The more elaborate, the more expensive.
7692015	7713795	someday when I have a house I'll have some arcade machines someday alright so we ready for the next email yes okay hello OLR since we are near the release of Sonic Generations this Tuesday I thought you guys would like to compare some of the music from the game yeah there's remixes up Rob you should probably pull this email because of the remixes on here sure I'll pull it up right now
7714655	7722736	but it has a classic remix of Speed Highway from Sonic Adventure which was one of my favorite pieces of music in that game.
7723437	7731598	A modernized Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, and a classic rooftop run from Sonic Unleashed which I didn't think I played.
7732138	7738799	Also, it's worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations out on November 22nd has its own set of levels to make it unique.
7740840	7742180	Okay, turn this up so I can hear this.
7753069	7754670	I've been hearing a lot of good things about Sonic Generations.
7754690	7757231	I'm going to post this one on the Tumblr.
7757531	7758071	Go for it.
7758172	7766836	Anyway, it's also reporting that the 3DS version of Sonic Generations has its own set of levels to make it unique from the PC 360 and PS3 versions.
7767356	7769497	I hope you and your listeners enjoy sampling these tracks.
7769737	7770317	Good day.
7770978	7773499	And this comes from Full Brazilian.
7774760	7774940	Ouch.
7785533	7788697	Alright, last one.
7789879	7790860	Chemical Plant Zone.
7790900	7792322	I'll skip ahead a little bit in this song here.
7794605	7794845	Oops.
7795206	7795386	Come on.
7801840	7803040	I don't like this one as much.
7803441	7806622	But I really like that Speed Highway.
7806642	7811664	I want to see the gameplay.
7814005	7815785	This looks pretty sweet, actually.
7818026	7819747	Yeah, I saw a little bit of it.
7819827	7820927	I really do want that.
7820947	7829731	Because it looks like it's really going back to some of the Sonic Adventure stuff.
7831437	7834719	Which Sonic Adventure is probably one of, it's on my list of favorites.
7835179	7839821	Okay, I gotta be honest, I haven't been paying this game much attention because let's be real.
7840121	7841042	Can we all be real for a minute?
7841502	7843663	Sonic's been really shitty for a long time.
7843903	7852868	And, you know, like especially once Sonic 4 kind of came out and it was kind of a thud, you know, like I just kind of say, oh, Sonic game, I'm sure it's more shit.
7853548	7856590	But I gotta say, I'm looking at that, that looks nice.
7858795	7860136	Let me look at another.
7860316	7864400	Now that I'm fucking on this, I want to see another little video here.
7864420	7869444	Looks like somebody made a tutorial here.
7869464	7873548	I think it's that same area.
7873588	7874689	Let me skip ahead a lot here.
7875376	7875656	All right.
7876076	7878398	Well, I'll go ahead and read the next email if you want.
7878418	7878718	Yeah.
7879178	7880879	I'm entranced by the Sonic video.
7880919	7881780	It looks pretty awesome.
7882040	7882320	Yeah.
7883041	7886463	Because it's sort of... God, it makes me want to barf from all the motion, though.
7886483	7892807	It goes from like a 2.5D to a full, you know, Sonic Adventure style.
7893087	7893387	Yeah.
7893928	7894108	Huh.
7894888	7898050	Really want... Actually, you know what game this makes me think of right off the bat?
7898170	7898771	What?
7898791	7899291	Sonic CD.
7902364	7903606	with how fluid it is.
7903666	7904648	I want to hear from the chat room.
7904668	7905990	Have you guys in chat been playing this?
7906210	7907332	Is it good?
7907392	7909455	Is this a Sonic game that I should be paying attention to?
7910937	7913341	Or is this one of those things that looks cool but it doesn't play so hot?
7914969	7916370	It looks like a place pretty classic, though.
7917171	7919052	Alright, so shall I go ahead and give you the last two?
7919092	7920533	Sorry, I'll close the video.
7920573	7921334	No, you can keep watching.
7921354	7922855	I don't care.
7922875	7932101	Weeks after Cliffy slammed a site for giving Gears 3 an 8.0, the big sites are running stories about gamers criticizing Uncharted 3 getting an 8 score as well.
7932521	7942749	Am I off base here, or do you think the more the vocal gamers, disregarding the factors that lead to the number score, are more willing to accept a 4 out of 5 rating as being a great game over an 8 of 10 being an 80% or an 80%?
7944970	7963768	Keep on Robert M. It really is a matter of numbers and perception because with a 4 out of 5, you've got that 4 so close to the top line, but then an 8, though, has two more levels of gradation between it, even though it is, in theory, the exact same ratings.
7965575	7967377	So I think it's just a matter of perception.
7967637	7969359	People are easily swayed.
7970661	7972303	Don't look at the numbers, look at the content.
7972423	7973184	That's what I have to say.
7973364	7979911	It's ironic because one of the things I got linked to in our chat room as you're reading that email is the Metacritic for Sonic Generations.
7980752	7983075	So I'm kind of taking a look at some of the scores.
7983135	7985537	It has a 77 on Metacritic, which, you know, I don't...
7986571	8012554	You have to really watch these websites because you're not going to necessarily agree with one or the other But some people on here, it has 77 overall, nobody's rated it anything higher than like an 8.5 But some folks are saying it's good, it's polished, but then some of the people that are dogging it a little bit Like say it's not as good as Colors, it's not very creative, and it feels like filler
8014469	8024823	and uh saying that it's just their shoehorning old Sonic games interesting of course if they want me to spend 60 bucks on it it's got to be better than average right
8026007	8028928	So, maybe we'll get some calls on that later, I don't know.
8029068	8029869	Anything else in the mailbag?
8030249	8030869	Yes, we do.
8031049	8031329	Alrighty.
8032910	8034290	As soon as I get back to the email.
8034350	8040033	Okay, the last one is, hi OLR, it's your family neighborhood spazinator.
8040713	8049237	I really don't have a gaming related topic for this week's show, but rather I was hoping that the three of you could possibly send out a happy birthday wish to a first time listener.
8049437	8049617	Nope.
8050337	8075008	yes all right my best friend Angie aka Gigi whose birthday is today that's 11-6 I couldn't possibly ask for a better friend than her thanks in advance okay happy birthday Gigi happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to you from Orange Lounge Radio you need to come up with an OLR birthday song
8076733	8077654	It's your birthday.
8077774	8078534	Good for you.
8079375	8080196	It's your birthday.
8080276	8081136	Here's some poo.
8084679	8085900	Happy birthday for reals.
8086921	8087341	There you go.
8087521	8089483	Actually, or there's this.
8089563	8089763	Hold on.
8089803	8090764	Let me see if I can do this here.
8091684	8093246	We could do happy birthday this way.
8095808	8096068	Come on.
8096128	8096368	Play.
8097509	8098049	Play, fool.
8101272	8102172	Oh, this is so irritating.
8102232	8104574	I'm waiting for someone to click the freaking play button on this.
8104634	8104955	Here we go.
8105235	8105475	Here we go.
8113979	8115420	It's Happy Birthday and Mario Paint.
8117301	8118181	Do you know something, Rob?
8118502	8118902	I tried.
8118982	8119722	Did you know something?
8119862	8122084	That song actually is still under copyright law.
8122724	8126606	And that if more than 25 people perform it in public, you can be sued for public performance.
8127306	8129288	Oh, well, you know what you're going to get from me?
8129788	8130788	Nothing, because I'm broke.
8130848	8131909	How about some farts?
8132229	8133250	I can spare that.
8135051	8136872	I have farts in your general direction.
8137752	8138373	Okay, that's it.
8138993	8140094	I played under 30 seconds.
8140114	8140654	That's fair use.
8141078	8142519	Alright, that's it for the Mailbag.
8142559	8143240	Send us emails.
8143280	8144121	We'll read your emails.
8144141	8146062	And I guess now we'll do your birthday wishes on the show.
8146122	8149005	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Because Jamie's nice.
8149305	8155330	Again, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Don't catch her when she's in a bad mood or she'll tell your friend, So what?
8155510	8156351	It's your birthday.
8156471	8157352	Screw you!
8158032	8162036	And maybe, just maybe, she'll mention you during a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
8178357	8183980	My FU of the week goes to the cold that I've had for the last two weeks, especially since I got sick at Disneyland.
8188263	8202191	And a secondary FU goes towards... I'm really trying to be understanding and thoughtful, but... Learn how to package an InDesign file, please.
8203504	8210692	instead of having me have to go back and fix all of the damn work because it was not packaged properly with all the proper links intact.
8210832	8211994	Oh, fuck you InDesign.
8212034	8212834	Fuck you so much.
8212895	8213896	I love you, but fuck you.
8214496	8214877	I'm done.
8216939	8217259	Loki?
8218921	8219101	Um...
8221323	8234931	MPU to Activision, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 it's always a pain in the ass every goddamn year when it launches just with all the regulation and this customer can't have it this time and everybody's calling it bitching and
8235680	8251010	I'm gonna sue and blah blah blah and yadda yadda yadda And so, yeah, fuck you to Call of Duty My FU of the week goes to the country fried steak I had this morning Cause seriously, deep fried steak?
8251190	8252231	Like, what the hell's that?
8253732	8261497	But, actually it was really good, that's why I'm giving it an FU Cause FU to the fact that I'll have to play like two hours of Damn Central 2 to work that off
8263879	8275267	If you had a good tasting food being so bad for you Alright, more news stories and then we're going to get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR but not just yet, we still have some more news stories Loki
8275939	8281321	Yes, of course, one of the things we like to complain about is pay-to-unlock content.
8281361	8285802	Basically content that's DLC that's already on the disc.
8286043	8293025	And so one such game, the high-profile game you might add, that has such a thing would be Gears of War 3.
8293725	8298247	And of course, the creator, Rod Ferguson...
8299447	8306453	is defending why they do have paid unlock content or DLC that's already on the disc.
8306493	8307454	Can't wait to hear this.
8308528	8310810	Basically saying... I love this.
8311150	8313592	We're not saying everything on the disc is product.
8314852	8317354	The disc is another delivery mechanism.
8318475	8333545	So basically their thought is that because the game was actually done back in the spring and they kind of held it until the fall, they had already created some of this download content that was going to be put out there.
8335546	8336287	And basically...
8338248	8351110	You know, they wanted... The first piece of download content had some guns and maps and stuff that they needed to have the data for for people that didn't buy it so that you could play with those people and whatnot.
8352411	8358172	Instead of just having you download all that again, they just put it on a disk to make it easier so you didn't have to download everything.
8358432	8363833	But obviously, going forward, any other download content will be... The entire contents will have to be downloaded.
8364653	8364733	Um...
8366333	8372656	They said we felt it was a win-win because no one is going to have to download anything huge when the DLC comes out.
8376578	8386622	I understand that, but I think the whole problem with people seeing this is you get things like with the Catwoman DLC and stuff where it's already on disc, but...
8387302	8391466	You know, obviously if you didn't buy the game new, you have to pay to unlock the content.
8391526	8394309	Well, you do have like 200 megs you download, because I just did that today.
8394329	8396511	It's downloading something.
8396571	8397933	Okay, so that is download content.
8398453	8400255	Well, okay, Katamari.
8400295	8401216	Yeah, the beautiful Katamari.
8401236	8405460	Beautiful Katamari had, you know, a lot of pay to unlock levels and stuff like that.
8406141	8407102	And it's not, you know...
8407702	8408383	Thank you for watching!
8434107	8437749	I think the thing that makes it muddy for people is when it's on disc.
8438970	8446674	We could have left it off and, you know, hey, here's another disc, but they believe that they did the right thing.
8449884	8450124	I don't know.
8463808	8467552	I remember having the keys, Dead Rising has costumes and stuff.
8469755	8470756	There's a lot of games that do it.
8470936	8471978	And I think it's kind of lame.
8472779	8474641	Because you have this stuff done.
8475101	8481730	It's not like the game was... I mean, I get some games are delayed or purposefully held to come out at a certain time.
8482430	8485011	But not all games are like that.
8485131	8495536	There's a lot of games where it's like, okay, we added some extra DLC content, like the Earth Defense Force expansions were already on the disc, all those weapons, and they're charging people for it.
8495876	8498037	Can we take a minute to praise somebody that did it right?
8498297	8500618	And that would be the folks behind Burnout Paradise.
8501398	8530195	and you want to talk about combating used game sales well the way you combat used game sales is to make people want to keep the game and not want to sell it back by doing regular content updates dude what if you'd instead of having you know people pay to unlock the additional content that's on the disc why not slowly unlock that content over you know every couple months something new unlocks give people reason to hold on to their games and not want to sell them used what a novel idea
8533414	8553555	or you know then you have also besides the slowly unlocking content you have some really cool download content later on that you know it's like you know people that sell their games back like man man I really need to buy that again so I can buy this download content that's good download content if you know you're willing to rebuy that game to play that content
8554494	8573165	Spazinator PC in our chatroom says this begs a question though at which point will we have $60 for a game then pay additional money to unlock the whole game how about the new Mortal Kombat game that came out I mean you had to pay money for the extra characters I mean I guess you could say that's extra or whatever but how about Arkham City
8574065	8583371	The Catwoman stuff, I guess you could say, okay, well, the code does come with the game, but, you know, there are a bunch of trophies and story elements that if you don't have that code, you're not going to get.
8583691	8587193	Or, heaven forbid, you got one of those boxes where the code was missing.
8588774	8593116	Even though, I guess, Warner Brothers has a little workaround, but still, it's an awful inconvenience to the consumer.
8594937	8596158	Battlefield had the same problem.
8596839	8597239	Oh, yeah.
8598940	8599540	So, I mean...
8604870	8605390	It's amazing.
8605410	8613595	If you just think of the long term, I bet you could combat used game sales easy by continuing to provide the regular content to keep it exciting.
8613935	8615336	Arkham City, for example.
8616076	8618758	You beat the game, but you haven't finished the game.
8619298	8620279	There's so much more to do.
8622515	8628020	Let's see, there is a big show coming up in a couple weeks where they show a lot of arcade games.
8628641	8635728	And one of the rumors going around about this upcoming arcade show is that Bejeweled is going to show up as an amusement title.
8636129	8638912	Yeah, apparently one of the biggest casual games ever.
8639432	8642476	Sega Amusements is supposed to be showing this.
8642576	8644818	Now, this could just be a huge rumor already.
8644978	8649580	But they are saying that Bejeweled could be just like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade, and so forth.
8649940	8653621	That could be making its way from a casual game to the arcade.
8653981	8654901	Here's my question.
8654941	8656222	Is it going to spit out tickets?
8657662	8660823	Because that seems to be the only way that games last in the arcade these days.
8661303	8663204	What would you guys think of a Bejeweled arcade game?
8664830	8690941	I wouldn't play it I like Bejeweled and if it spits out tickets it'll be a good ticket spitting game it's like sad that I'm admitting this but otherwise would I pay to play it in the arcades not unless it gives me some type of experience I can't get at home which I doubt unless it's like I don't know really somehow touch based and somehow really fun and different but I just don't see how many ways you do Bejeweled
8691161	8694747	Don't get me wrong, but Jeweled's a great game, but is it worth 50 cents to play good?
8695047	8695829	I'm not sure.
8697571	8699695	So, we'll see.
8702436	8705798	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
8705898	8708980	DarkSakura, while I try to get the live stream up, because we crashed again.
8709181	8709781	Oh, boo.
8710661	8714464	Well, LEGO Universe is going away.
8715405	8716765	Oh, so sad.
8717906	8721488	Because they're not getting enough players.
8721669	8729193	They haven't got enough players and enough paying subscribers, so LEGO Universe is going to be closing on January 31st, 2012.
8732155	8739298	and they are also going to be closing the Playwall Studio which will be laying off 115 people.
8741139	8741599	Sadness.
8742739	8743280	That is sad.
8743380	8744640	Again, more job losses.
8744660	8745040	That's sad.
8745360	8748742	But I didn't even... Okay, this is sad but I didn't even realize LEGO Universe was out.
8750302	8751863	It was supposed to be this big MMO, right?
8751923	8753444	It came out about a year ago.
8753784	8755885	Was it supposed to be out on DS or something?
8755965	8758066	It was supposed to be an MMO on the 3DS or something?
8758506	8759166	Am I crazy?
8759486	8760487	No, you're thinking of...
8763121	8763682	Oh, what is it?
8763782	8765625	There's the one that's like Grand Theft Auto.
8765705	8771974	It's Lego City Stories, which I will be buying.
8772294	8773015	Ah, that's it.
8773196	8774537	I will be buying Lego City Stories.
8774558	8776200	Okay, I got to confuse Lego City Stories.
8776240	8778443	Because that is Grand Theft Auto Lego.
8778463	8779024	All right.
8779761	8784784	But yeah, it's basically not enough players, not enough paying people, so they can't afford to keep it open.
8784904	8786645	Interesting that they didn't decide to go free to play.
8786665	8788046	Or no, they already were free to play, weren't they?
8788066	8788586	They did free to play.
8788606	8789006	Oh, bummer.
8789527	8796071	And the quote says, it has not been possible to convert a satisfactory number of players to paying subscribers.
8796191	8797691	In other words, ain't no one playing this.
8798092	8799653	No, ain't no one paying for it.
8800273	8801494	They just want to play the free stuff.
8802154	8802574	Sure.
8802614	8803555	They don't want to pay for content.
8804435	8804835	Sure!
8805575	8808996	Of course people just want to play the free stuff.
8809537	8811657	I'm curious to see if DC Universe is able to make money.
8812437	8813038	It'd be interesting.
8813238	8813758	Oh, I'm sure.
8814618	8817199	They have enough goodies.
8817639	8821580	And if you pay five bucks for it, for content, you get an account upgrade.
8822140	8823281	The same thing is with Star Trek Online.
8823401	8828042	That's why when I start Star Trek Online, I'm automatically going in with the middle level account.
8828462	8828962	Oh, that's cool.
8829243	8830704	Because you paid for it in the past.
8831144	8841932	Well, apart from, yeah, my subscription, I also bought Cryptic Points so that I could get the extra uniforms and the other ship and stuff.
8842192	8842813	Oh, alright.
8843893	8846736	But honestly, I haven't spent more than $20 outside on that game.
8847477	8853462	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into the Skype line and your Twitter topics at twitter.com.
8853642	8855424	So last chance to get those in.
8855844	8857186	Loki.
8857286	8863371	Yes, so as we mentioned before, the Mass Effect 3 beta has leaked out.
8865073	8867996	Apparently there was a private closed beta for Mass Effect 3.
8868817	8874081	and somehow they kind of accidentally threw it up on there for everybody to download.
8874202	8878325	It gives people access to both single player and multiplayer sections of the game.
8878925	8894518	And of course, because of that, there's been lots of screenshots and whatnot showing different things like origin support, multiplayer character creation, level selection, stats, new user interfaces and whatnot.
8895119	8897000	So, neat.
8898021	8902184	Of course, the game will be coming out in February or March.
8902224	8903025	I know it's spring.
8904646	8905767	Lots of stuff coming out in the spring.
8909530	8909950	All right.
8910471	8912432	Well, yeah, Mass Effect is going to be a huge one, though.
8912592	8914334	But oops on that leak, right?
8914714	8915675	Yep.
8916495	8918397	It's not really a closed beta if you put it out for everybody.
8919457	8921659	Well, that was a Microsoft boo-boo from what I understand.
8921759	8923981	Man, I would be pissed if I were them.
8925416	8950748	so alright moving on to one more story for you guys and this goes back to the music games DDR of course getting a new version but they're redoing second mix remember we talked about the new arcade mix it's going to have second mix inside it well to celebrate Dance Dance Revolution X3 versus second mix there's going to be a new second mix soundtrack that includes remixes they are remixing Keep On Movin' by Y&Co Y&Co

8997682	8998202	You know what, Rob?
8998402	8998582	What?
8998722	9001003	I could hook up the Dreamcast and we could play Second Mix.
9001103	9004925	It's just not the same as a pretty high-def TV.
9005125	9008887	Didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about how they were redoing the graphics in HD and all that?
9008987	9010667	It sounded kind of neat.
9011047	9013748	You know, for us super music game nerd fans, it sounded super neat.
9013768	9014249	You know what?
9014609	9014789	What?
9015769	9022512	I completely forgot that it was on my phone, but I actually giggled in my car the other day because Love came on my iPhone.
9022652	9023092	Oh, really?
9023532	9027394	I forgot I had the Sonic Dreams CD when it came out.
9027616	9028007	Very nice
9031132	9032693	Love is the Power is the Ending of Second Mix
9059668	9067813	Nico Nico-chan tweeted us this week at twitter.com slash OLR and put, have any of you played the game Hyperdimension Neptunia?
9068834	9070015	Does this sound familiar to anyone?
9070255	9071275	Yeah, it does sound familiar.
9072516	9073457	I had to read up on it.
9073517	9074538	It's on the PlayStation 3.
9075598	9079241	And it's kind of like, well, this is what I thought was interesting.
9079341	9086025	It's the console wars as represented by female anime chicks.
9086045	9086245	Yeah.
9087106	9088146	Yes, there's that.
9088166	9089687	I didn't expect Animatrix to be female.
9089907	9092687	There's two things that made me think this was very interesting.
9092727	9100749	And one of them was the fact that it's by the company Compile Heart, which is actually the dude that used to lead Compile, I guess, made this company.
9101129	9103730	Now, granted, he left in like 2006 or something like that.
9103790	9104750	But I don't know.
9105090	9109711	It kind of gave me hope for like just half a second that maybe just possibly someday...
9111735	9116908	They could come back with another version of The Guardian Legend.
9117791	9118531	I would hope so.
9118951	9121052	Or at least another Guardia game.
9121432	9121612	Yeah.
9121792	9126813	You know, maybe the franchise could totally work touched up for the modern era.
9127073	9127334	Right.
9127994	9128214	Yeah.
9128594	9135256	So I was going to try to bring up the YouTube, but we're having to deal on the podcast right now with the Internet feed being down.
9135316	9138156	So I can't even bring up YouTube because our Internet is completely down right now.
9138176	9138877	We're not even live.
9139577	9140517	Live listeners can't hear us.
9140697	9143398	So I'm left with nothing but Twitter because no one can call us either.
9144898	9145679	So let me go to Twitter.
9145699	9146759	I'm keeping an eye on it, Rob.
9146919	9147420	I know, thank you.
9148220	9151562	Going to Surtur on the Twitter says, I have a new Android phone.
9151622	9152642	What are some good games?
9153003	9153943	Free or money?
9154323	9155044	LoveOLR.
9155244	9155604	Thank you.
9156905	9157725	Android games.
9157985	9159766	We all have iOS.
9160327	9164429	I have a shitty Android, so I don't play anything on there.
9166290	9174078	Well, I mean, a lot of the games that are on iOS are also on Android, so I'm sure there's pretty much a lot of stuff crosses over.
9175179	9179283	I can't think of any Android-specific games that... Get our type.
9179303	9186930	I mean, if you have a good enough Android phone, I guess, so there's also the PlayStation Suite stuff where you can play old PlayStation 1 games.
9189013	9194171	MNZiba on Twitter Minecraft If you're into that That's your thing
9197055	9201357	MNZBud sent us a tweet saying, OLR, I found this while I was walking around Kohl's.
9201437	9203018	There are so many things wrong with this.
9203098	9209800	I can't bring up the picture again, but I actually, thankfully, I looked at it before we recorded tonight, and it was like a picture.
9209880	9211301	It was like a duck hunt game.
9211581	9212321	Yeah, I saw that.
9212341	9213082	Did you see that?
9213182	9213982	What the heck was that?
9214022	9214782	It's like a duck hunt.
9216103	9219444	I'm assuming it was one of those plug-and-play kind of style games or something.
9219464	9220125	Yeah, it just looks...
9221025	9221325	Derpy.
9221446	9226951	It looked a little weird, but not completely out of character or whatever for those plug-and-play games.
9230674	9231915	Quick, we need to fill our topic.
9232016	9234478	I need to relay a message to the chat room real quick.
9234498	9235078	It says resolved.
9235479	9237221	Oh, are we able to come back then?
9237701	9238502	We're connected again.
9239222	9239803	We're up again?
9240043	9240544	We're up again.
9241805	9242245	Oh, we are.
9242325	9243366	We are up again.
9243426	9246009	We're just not on... The chat's.
9247726	9248047	I'm not up yet.
9248067	9248948	I'm showing you the chat.
9249028	9250870	No, we just came back on the feed.
9252952	9253553	So there you go.
9255235	9256075	All right, so we're coming back.
9256096	9262402	Sorry, podcast listeners, but the fun and joy of doing live radio is that sometimes your interwebs gets all screwed up.
9263584	9265726	So we were just reading through some tweets, live listeners.
9267754	9268014	DuckHunter
9294031	9319964	I wouldn't do it inside either unless you have like a huge studio empty bedroom it makes me think though the dishes are done man all right now I can go to some of these links that Tiger Claw sent us because I wasn't able to pull them up before but on the Twitter twitter.com slash OLR by the way skypline should be back as you guys are reconnecting to the feed 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio
9320744	9339393	TigerClaw had sent us a tweet apparently some bandits stole 6,000 copies of Modern Warfare 3 in France a truck full of copies of the game was hijacked by professional thieves the truck was driving through southern Paris on Saturday and it was rammed by another vehicle
9339873	9351256	Two men emerged from the colliding car with knives, used tear gas to subdue the driver, and got away with 6,000 video games, which they are valuing at 400,000 euros.
9352436	9355297	That's crazy, but apparently the game was Modern Warfare 3.
9356117	9361198	So if you see some early copies on French eBay, you know where it came from.
9362118	9362819	French eBay?
9362839	9365299	Get it?
9367020	9367620	So there you go.
9367920	9368600	French eBay.
9369614	9370515	No, not Frenchie Bay.
9370535	9376520	Alright, moving on to another tweet here from Tiger Claw.
9376621	9376921	One more.
9377701	9382286	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego is being turned into a live action film?
9382906	9383727	Is this trolling?
9384207	9388191	Because seriously, I clicked on this and Walden Media and...
9391638	9397162	Jennifer Lopez are teaming up to do Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
9397862	9399343	Please say this is a troll post.
9400764	9401585	Are you trolling us?
9402325	9403846	Is this trolling on Twitter, please?
9405447	9409410	Walden Media, they're the guys that did the Chronicles of Narnia, right?
9409710	9415894	Has acquired the rights to turn Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego into a live action film involving Jennifer Lopez.
9416975	9420817	I guess I could see physically that kind of looks right, but...
9425720	9430322	It could be an interesting movie, but I wonder if they're going to make it just like a straight-up kids movie.
9430462	9431803	I think that's where they would go with it.
9432623	9435764	You know, kind of like Inspector Gadget or something like that.
9436865	9437225	I don't know.
9437665	9438446	That's what I kind of think.
9438946	9440387	Although, I will say this.
9440487	9444408	If it doesn't have this as the theme song, then I don't... Oops.
9444629	9446730	If it doesn't have this as the theme song, then it doesn't count.
9446750	9447530	Yeah!
9447730	9448070	Ooh!
9460057	9464141	Can you imagine Jennifer Lopez featuring Pitbull just ruining this fucking song?
9470855	9472836	All right.
9473196	9475197	At a theater near you soon, apparently.
9476458	9476778	All right.
9477399	9479680	Again, the phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9479920	9482922	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9482962	9483922	And that's all the tweets, too.
9483962	9489045	Let me reload just in case things came through and we had the internet downtime that we were having.
9490306	9491046	Did we go down again?
9492261	9493483	Oh, this is terrible.
9493724	9494265	What's terrible?
9494385	9499955	Here's... I looked up a little bit more information on that We're in the World's Carmen Sandiego thing.
9500296	9502200	Here's the film's logline, they say.
9502320	9502540	It says...
9503168	9503988	What's a logline?
9504449	9506089	I think it's like the pitch, basically.
9506429	9506789	Okay.
9507270	9517974	When the ACME agency's greatest detective, Carmen Sandiego, becomes the world's greatest thief, it's up to her former partner to follow her clues and track her down.
9518574	9522496	Their cat and mouse game leads the partner to confront a greater mystery.
9522956	9525197	Is Carmen really a thief or a hero?
9527078	9527518	Oh, great.
9527558	9530519	So Carmen Sandiego may not end up even being a villainess.
9533840	9535141	Yeah, exactly.
9538402	9544604	Alright, that is it for the tweets tonight.
9544724	9551687	I'm going to try re-logging into Skype because some folks are telling me that they can't see us on Skype and it might be because we went down while we were on.
9554788	9555849	Yay, internet issues.
9556189	9556769	Live radio.
9557089	9563512	Do we have any last minute stories or other stories we didn't get to in the show tonight that we can fill a little time with while I try to get the Skype line working?
9564965	9570090	I like pie and cake and ice cream and fire.
9570830	9571371	Okay, we're up.
9571391	9572091	We're getting calls.
9572111	9572512	There we go.
9572552	9573152	It's finally working.
9573192	9574173	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9574193	9574554	Who's this?
9575395	9576075	It's Shane.
9576175	9577757	Hey, Shane, a.k.a.
9577777	9578517	Miklatov, right?
9579258	9579498	Sure.
9579719	9580059	What's up?
9581112	9582273	Nothing, just playing some WoW.
9582413	9584615	Oops, I'm holding down shift and talking invent.
9587178	9588539	Who are you talking to invent?
9588999	9589960	Us talking to Todd.
9590000	9590901	We're playing a dungeon.
9591001	9591421	Oh, I see.
9591822	9593884	Even though you guys live in the same house and he's upstairs.
9594404	9597327	Yeah, he's upstairs, so it makes it so I don't have to yell.
9597467	9597687	I see.
9597747	9598287	All right, that's fine.
9599288	9602329	Um, anyway, what was I talking about?
9602389	9603850	Was I talking about anything yet?
9603870	9605031	Because I don't think I was.
9605051	9608772	No, you were talking about playing WoW and then calling into the show.
9608792	9609693	Oh, yeah.
9609793	9613554	I'm calling because you said I should call because of Sonic Generations.
9614014	9614294	Oh, yeah.
9614375	9615315	Because we actually own it.
9615615	9616536	Dooyah, how is it?
9617197	9625067	It's pretty fantastic, and I want to add for a Sonic game after that, but it's actually just a pretty good game.
9625487	9629773	Now, the Metacritic scores were kind of fairly good, I guess.
9629853	9632256	Not spectacular, but it's alright.
9632296	9632756	It's pretty good.
9634078	9641105	The thing is, with a 77%, I think you said it was, that is average.
9641245	9649774	It should be average, at least, if you go by a school grading scale, or it's well above average if you go by a regular grading scale.
9649814	9656440	But regardless, it's a nice throwback to classic Sonic in the way that Sonic 4 was, but a little bit better.
9656460	9656881	Mm-hmm.
9659042	9686418	and the best part about it to me is all the music because like say you're playing a Sonic Adventure level and you're playing as new Sonic and then you go and play as fat old Sonic it changes the music like one of them went to like a synth poppy song because obviously if you're playing on a Genesis you would not have that style CD quality music what's the whole twist with the new and old Sonic like I seriously don't know I have not been following this game
9686818	9695302	There's some evil force and it messes up time and you get thrown around.
9695602	9699544	Am I correct in thinking they yet again are cashing in on nostalgic Sonic?
9700225	9707008	Oh yeah, because from what I was watching Todd play, and it looks like the first three stages are from Sonic 1.
9707428	9709189	The next three are Sonic... Oh no, sorry.
9709429	9712370	The first three are Genesis era, so it's Sonic 1, 2, and 3.
9713151	9714111	And then it's like...
9715692	9716393	Gosh, dang it.
9716413	9718734	I want to say the next is Dreamcast.
9719415	9723017	And then the next ones after that are like the newer Sonic games.
9723157	9724278	So it's like a Mario Kart game.
9725839	9726539	A Mario Kart?
9726659	9728420	Oh, like they use old stuff?
9728480	9730082	Yeah, kind of.
9731322	9732903	But seriously, it's all about the music.
9733164	9742810	When I heard just random and to me awesome vocal songs from like the Sonic Dreamcast days, I got really excited.
9742830	9742910	Yeah.
9744421	9745441	I think those songs are amazing.
9745461	9747462	So it's nostalgia that works for you then?
9747962	9752823	Yes, and I'm not even a huge fan of Sonic in the least, but it is pretty neat.
9753203	9754223	Alright, well I'll have to check it out.
9754283	9755623	Is it still $60 though?
9756063	9757024	Yes, it is.
9757064	9762205	Well, off and on, at work we had it for $39 for a few days.
9762465	9763085	That's not as bad.
9764405	9765865	Still, there's too many games to play right now.
9766045	9769686	I've got to play Arkham City is really good, and then I've got to play Skyrim.
9770586	9771647	I've played it, it's okay.
9772147	9773007	You don't like Arkham City?
9773067	9773567	What's wrong with you?
9774547	9776228	It's just Batman.
9778409	9780069	But it's goddamn Batman!
9782470	9782750	Alright.
9783391	9785672	Anything else you want to talk about that you're doing in the gaming world?
9787132	9790574	Well, I already talked about the Old Republic stuff on Horde House.
9790674	9792054	Which everybody should listen to.
9792114	9793075	HordeHouse.com.
9793135	9794315	It's lulzy Warcraft.
9794355	9796396	Even if you don't like Warcraft, you get to hear dick and fart jokes.
9797148	9798609	Yeah, that's terrible.
9798890	9800491	That's awesome.
9802593	9807678	Uncharted 3 is getting, I guess, somewhat okay reviews.
9807738	9810481	Not like, oh my god, outstanding like the second one.
9810761	9810961	Really?
9810981	9813704	From what I've played of it so far, I kind of agree.
9814124	9814585	Ooh.
9814725	9817247	Which makes me sad because I am a huge Uncharted fan.
9817267	9817567	Why is that?
9817608	9822272	I even have an Uncharted 3 standee in my basement that I stole from work.
9822392	9824594	Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2
9843815	9849821	Well, I don't want to give a lot of spoilers away, of course, because that's mean and I haven't beaten it yet.
9850322	9856528	From what I've played so far, which is probably about six hours, it feels like...
9858584	9886557	like okay the step from one to two in the series was drastic and amazing this one feels like they took all the good parts of two and then like the combat is a little bit better if not a little bit harder the graphics are better but the story just isn't quite there it seems to be everybody just saying you know hey Nathan Drake why do you chase treasure you're stupid and
9887137	9891159	Okay, so it's not, like, the story is not nearly as gripping as previously.
9891239	9892459	No, not at all.
9893139	9898481	And they're using all these, and, you know, the stories aren't realistic in the least.
9899482	9910386	The first game had, like, Nazi zombie mutant things, and the second game had these Azteci big bulky guys that drank some liquid that made them super buff.
9910566	9910766	Right.
9910946	9912047	But this one's using, like...
9913167	9915509	Like technology you would see in James Bond.
9916609	9918430	And it just isn't doing anything for me.
9919731	9920091	Interesting.
9920692	9923833	Speaking of James Bond, didn't those GoldenEye remakes come out too this week?
9924134	9924674	Yeah, they did.
9924694	9925935	Oh my god, busy week.
9926675	9930157	And the PS3 one has a move bundle that looks pretty nice.
9931158	9931478	Interesting.
9932369	9934230	Alright, well, Miklatov, I'm going to let you go.
9934250	9936510	Do you have any other thoughts for listeners before we get more calls?
9937271	9937491	Nope.
9937851	9938071	Alright.
9938771	9940312	Well, have fun on Vent doing quests.
9940852	9941112	Okay.
9941212	9941752	Good times.
9941852	9943072	Bye.
9943092	9947394	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you would like to give us a call.
9948454	9955980	Some folks in chat, chat.orangelandre.com, Actdeft, I think he's talking about the Sonic game in our chat room, says $30 on Steam.
9956061	9957262	That's not nearly as bad.
9957422	9958963	I can check.
9959183	9962246	And I wonder if during the holiday sale it'll be dirt cheap.
9962546	9963286	That's the thing with Steam games.
9963306	9964427	Dirt cheap during the holiday?
9964708	9965188	I'm on it.
9965308	9965849	Yeah, I know.
9965909	9966569	Seriously, right?
9966969	9967550	That's where I'm at.
9970373	9982030	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Loki, I don't know if you had a minute to look and see if there's anything last minute to talk about to help us fill time here because of our downtime They relaunched PlayStation Home Oh yeah, I forgot that was this week
9983066	9984707	and so it's all fantastic now I guess.
9984847	9985287	Really?
9985407	9987307	I haven't logged in.
9987368	9988168	What were they supposed to change?
9988188	9989648	I heard like questing and shit now?
9989948	9992009	It's like all completely redone.
9992049	9994590	I mean it looks like Disneyland almost the way they have it.
9994850	9997911	Don't say words that are going to make me want to download it immediately if it's not that.
9998091	10004634	Okay, it's segmented like a theme park so they've got different like sections like you know a midway type thing.
10004654	10006694	It's more of a sports center.
10006714	10008275	It's more of a Knott's Berry Farm.
10009215	10009495	Yeah.
10011236	10011496	Alright.
10013586	10015127	So that's neat, I guess.
10015787	10021711	And then, you know the folks that did that wonderful King's Quest, The Silver Lining?
10022031	10023431	They're actually putting out an original game.
10024212	10025593	Oh yeah, I heard about that too.
10025613	10026453	That sounds awesome.
10026813	10035838	Cognition, and it's basically an episodic detective adventure about an FBI agent who gains the power to see past events by touching any object.
10038490	10048229	and of course they have a Kickstarter up to fund it and they're looking for $25,000 and you get all sorts of sweet shit if you contribute to that.
10052340	10073070	And then there's a rumor that Mega Man may be coming to Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I guess there's a poster in the background of one of the levels that's inspired from an Uncanny X-Men cover And they have Mega Man on there That was from the Days of Future Past
10077979	10102226	and uh apparently uh you know it doesn't show Mega Man as deceased or apprehended so people think maybe download content something like that that'd be a real dick move but hey whatever you know they can make some extra money for via download content you know the moment they put them up for download that everyone's gonna get it it's gonna be instant money maker because everyone wants Mega Man and roll
10104667	10129535	and then um last but not least of course um you know we talked a little bit about Nintendo patents earlier and uh now Sony has actually patented biometric uh controllers for well obviously and also for the handhelds as well and not really sure what this would be used for but you know kind of think of like you know uh maybe some stuff that you know do with maybe uh
10131247	10140750	Some of the stuff you saw with the Vitality Sensor or they have the Ubisoft Energy thing, basically reads your blood pressure, heart rate, and that kind of stuff.
10140770	10153535	So maybe for exercise programs or something like that, they may have a special controller or attachment for like a move controller or something like that that would feed into that so you could see if you're exercising at the right level or whatever.
10153857	10155398	I just want to jump in for live listeners.
10155498	10156699	It looks like we're streaming again.
10156879	10159040	Once again, we had an internet outage, unfortunately.
10159420	10162342	I really appreciate you guys sticking with us through our downtime.
10162382	10163543	Again, this is out of our hands.
10164563	10166524	Why would we purposefully cut you guys off?
10166544	10167385	That would be ridiculous.
10168385	10169426	Well, trust me.
10169566	10172247	I've been dealing with this for the last three days, and it's a pain in the ass.
10172268	10173788	It makes playing MMOs not fun.
10175149	10176650	Unfortunately, we're doing our best through this.
10176730	10177710	We are getting another call, though.
10177730	10183293	I guess people can see that we're back up, even though I'm still waiting for the chat room to catch up and get us.
10183373	10184373	We are getting calls again.
10184433	10185534	So, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10185554	10185914	Who's this?
10187275	10189556	Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
10189756	10191116	Hey, how you doing, Actdeft?
10191156	10191897	It's good to hear from you.
10193277	10195018	Yeah, I'm doing pretty fine, I guess.
10195759	10196079	What's up?
10196119	10196579	What's on your mind?
10198120	10203042	First of all, I want to talk about, well, say about Sonic Generations on PC.
10204029	10206970	I haven't played it, but it's cheaper on Steam.
10207190	10212972	You know, and we mentioned that on the show, but of course you guys didn't hear it because of our downtime.
10213352	10216113	But yeah, it sounds like it's a more reasonable price on Steam, right?
10219514	10220434	Are you still there, Actdeft?
10221915	10222495	Yeah, I'm here.
10222675	10222875	Okay.
10223195	10225276	It sounds like it's a more reasonable price on Steam then, right?
10226596	10228917	Yeah, it's like $30.
10229577	10230397	So did you buy it?
10232058	10232198	Yeah.
10232862	10235343	Oh, what do you think of Sonic Generations?
10236543	10245866	Like I said, I haven't played it, but many people have talked pretty good about it, so I may get it if it's cheaper on Steam's holiday sale.
10248166	10254148	That's kind of where I'm at, is that if it's on Steam, then I'm just going to wait for the Uber sale that comes later on and get it then.
10256508	10257069	We'll see.
10258029	10259269	What else have you been playing lately?
10259609	10262070	What have you been playing if you haven't been playing Sonic Generations?
10263812	10265032	I have been playing Bastion.
10266332	10267773	Oh, Bastion's cool.
10267873	10270213	Have you been playing that on the PC or 360 or what?
10271133	10271833	Yeah, PC.
10272493	10276834	Right now my 360's broken so I can't play on it.
10278314	10284736	I remember they were having a $5 sale on Bastion or something like that this week on Steam.
10284756	10285136	$7, I think.
10285696	10287616	I got it as a birthday gift.
10288256	10288996	Oh, very cool.
10289276	10290176	What do you think of Bastion?
10291737	10293077	I haven't played it a lot, but
10294024	10295825	I have played, it's pretty good.
10296125	10297186	It's pretty addicting.
10298487	10302769	It reminds me of old school Zelda or old school adventure RPGs.
10304250	10310394	What do you think about that narrator that's in the game that has to talk about everything as you're playing through it?
10311334	10312815	I don't know, I liked it.
10312895	10314216	It's a pretty nice addition.
10314296	10321840	It makes you feel like you're playing it with someone and it's telling you the story like
10322769	10323369	I liked it.
10323870	10327411	I don't know if anyone hates it or doesn't like it.
10327732	10327852	Yeah.
10327892	10328032	Yeah.
10346260	10346840	Probably.
10347321	10349522	It would be pretty bland, I think.
10349642	10354885	But yeah, the narrator adds something to it that makes it more appealing.
10355025	10357207	The soundtrack to that game is great, too.
10358607	10360749	Yeah, I may feature it in the future.
10360789	10361909	I love that song segment.
10362190	10362630	Very good.
10362690	10363270	Oh, there you go.
10363330	10363951	I love that idea.
10364531	10365472	Hey, I've got to play this for you.
10365492	10367913	This is a parody that was making its way around the internet this week.
10367933	10375658	I don't know if you guys saw this, but this is the Bastion narrator – well, it's not really him, but somebody impersonating him – doing his take on other video games.
10376462	10376802	DarkSakura.com
10406301	10408782	And what's funny is that that's like really what playing the game is like.
10409782	10410102	Yeah.
10411303	10412223	So that's a pretty good parody.
10412263	10412703	I like that.
10412743	10413084	Good job.
10414444	10415404	I'll watch it later.
10416285	10417945	It's really funny.
10418105	10419486	It's on this website called Dorkly.
10419546	10420847	I don't know if they're just hosting the video.
10420907	10421727	No, they're awesome.
10421747	10423447	They put out a bunch of weird stuff like that.
10424148	10424388	Nice.
10425688	10426209	Awesome.
10426229	10428489	Well, Actdeft, anything else you want to share on the show before we let you go?
10429970	10434572	Probably a question for Loki about 360s right now.
10435112	10435412	All right.
10435871	10436131	Loki?
10440152	10443813	Is there going to be any special or price deduction for the 360?
10443873	10445173	I want to get one for Christmas.
10446013	10450154	So I don't know if it's going to still be $200 or it's going to get cheaper.
10450494	10454115	They're not going to announce any price drops.
10454916	10464498	If anything, they just have the holiday bundles right now, which for like a 250 gigabyte system, I think they've got Fable 3 and Halo Reach in there.
10465758	10469900	You will see some cutthroat deals going on Black Friday as well.
10470120	10473461	We're already hearing about retailers that are probably going to offer the system.
10473781	10479123	And it won't be a price reduction so much, but that you'll get a free $50 or even $100 gift card when you buy the system.
10479143	10481404	And I can't remember what retailer was rumored to be doing that.
10481424	10481985	Was it Toys R Us?
10488067	10489587	Toys R Us or Target.
10490468	10499730	Keep an eye out for those Black Friday ads because you're probably not going to see a price reduction on the system itself, but you'll see these other little deals to try and get you to go buy the system there.
10500271	10504512	And when you're talking $100 gift card, that could be a pretty big thing.
10504532	10512354	Of course, I know you're in Mexico, but you come up to California to take advantage of some of those sales sometimes, right?
10512374	10512514	Yeah.
10514150	10517671	Yeah, sometimes though I get my bonus until December, so...
10519265	10522487	I won't be able to take advantage of that
10547319	10547840	Yeah, I think so.
10547860	10549422	I hope that there's at least a pre-
10560899	10565142	Go ahead.
10565322	10572568	AGN409 in our chatroom says keep a look on at slickdeals.net Suggest that too.
10573869	10575650	I think we might be losing the internet again.
10576051	10576391	We are.
10577191	10579853	Unfortunately, that brings the Actdeft call to a close.
10579994	10582716	Actdeft, I don't know if you can hear us, but thank you so much for your call.
10582756	10583716	We really appreciate it.
10586378	10586718	Is that it?
10586738	10587959	Did the internet go down completely again?
10587979	10588379	Yes, it did.
10588840	10589960	We lost the show again.
10590621	10591001	Again?
10591521	10592021	Sorry.
10592542	10593282	It's not your fault.
10593302	10594263	It's just Comcast.
10594423	10596364	It's frustrating, but I know it's not your fault.
10596384	10597785	It's because of the rain.
10597825	10598705	Is it really?
10598906	10600106	It does this every year, you know.
10600787	10603648	Right when the rainy season starts and it gets cold.
10603728	10606490	It gets cloudy and the cable's like, ah, clouds!
10607270	10611453	It just seems to do this when it starts getting hot and when it starts getting cold.
10611860	10613541	Hey, I love my mommy!
10639565	10642286	and then also apparently Gearbox being awesome.
10642846	10663131	There was a guy that was a Borderlands fan who died of cancer at the age of 22 and so Gearbox actually did a eulogy as Claptrap and also this kid will be featured in the next Borderlands game as an NPC which is kind of cool.
10665336	10666357	Well, that's a nice gesture.
10666757	10666917	Yeah.
10666937	10675922	That's always really nice to see the companies do that for, you know, people when they die that were important, especially if it was really before their time.
10676982	10680264	So, well, I guess, is that it for Last Minute Stories?
10681304	10682505	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
10682785	10683145	Yeah.
10683385	10683926	Unfortunate.
10684326	10687307	All right, well, unfortunately, we're missing a Skype line right now.
10687968	10691850	I feel really bad, especially for those guys that tune up live, but again, out of our control.
10692475	10697498	Well, that's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap things up.
10697638	10699740	So I will say this.
10699780	10700781	I'll start with this, of course.
10700921	10704183	Once again, guys, thanks for tuning into our show and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
10704283	10708105	Even when we're having crazy internet downtime and so forth, we really appreciate it.
10708186	10709066	It means a lot to us.
10709626	10711848	If you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a friend about the show.
10711908	10721054	Word of mouth is so important, and we just want to build our community and grow stronger and maybe find some people that work for the cable company who can make sure our internet connection stays up.
10721194	10721454	Who knows?
10723356	10725497	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
10725757	10727858	DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
10728158	10729639	We go to print this week.
10730459	10734762	I have a seven-page research paper due this week.
10736783	10741345	Next week, I will probably not cry so much.
10741646	10742626	I'm about ready to go.
10744647	10745768	Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?
10746608	10749090	I will be playing Saints Row the Third this week.
10749190	10749670	At some point.
10751175	10751917	That's my goal at least.
10752058	10753120	Hopefully sooner rather than later.
10753161	10756409	If not, I'll play Saints Row 2 on PC.
10757134	10768921	And my final thought tonight is, well, A, I'm really bummed about the internet going down, but I guess the one silver lining about it is that that means we're going to finish up early, just in time for Pinkberry.
10768981	10770762	I know, let's go.
10771243	10773484	All right, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
10773764	10775825	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show.
10775845	10776506	We really appreciate it.
10776526	10777326	And it just came back up.
10777627	10778327	Did it just come back up?
10778347	10779007	It just came back up.
10779127	10781429	Well, it'll come back up in time for folks to hear the credits.
10781869	10783069	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
10783089	10786450	We'll see you next week, hopefully with less internet lulls.
