0	19520	Tonight, November 6th, 2011, a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto is unveiled, a major
19520	29760	MMO goes free to play, and what is in store for the Wii next after Skyward Sword?
29760	34880	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34880	38520	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38520	47280	We are live tonight, November the 6th of 2011, with the 434th show of Orange Lounge Radio.
47280	51500	We were off last week, but we're back tonight to join you over the next few hours live to
51500	55760	talk about video games and gaming culture and have some lols, hopefully.
55760	58700	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts.
58700	62000	Say hello over there to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
62000	63000	Hi.
63000	64000	How are you?
64000	65560	I'm tired, Rob.
65560	69360	It's been especially a little while since we've heard from you, because we were unexpectedly
69360	73280	sort of off last week, I mean, that all came up at the last minute, but you had been gone
73280	74960	the week before because you were at Disneyland.
74960	75960	Yes.
75960	78840	Or as I was saying on the show, you were at Blizzcon a little too late.
78840	82520	I was actually, I met some Blizzcon people that were staying at our hotel.
82520	83520	Nice.
83520	84520	And they were calling it DizCon.
84520	86640	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard that term before.
86640	90880	I've wanted to go, here's my thing with Blizzcon, as much as I love the Blizzard products, I'm
90880	97080	sorry, I'm not paying $150 to go to your publicly open press conference and play your demos,
97080	102520	like I don't get, does not compute function, but I will totally go to go to all the hotel
102520	106400	parties because there's some sweet parties that get thrown, and then like DizCon, I'll
106400	110040	go for that, because like, shit, I go to Disneyland all the time anyway.
110040	111720	If you listen to the show any length of time, you know that.
111720	116360	I just kept running in though to other WoW players, and so I'd go talk to them, and Dan
116360	120520	would just roll his eyes and go somewhere else, because he pretty much hates it.
120520	121520	The WoWs.
121520	122520	He hates the WoWs.
122520	123520	All right.
123520	127280	And I've got a new obsession too, which is the WoW model viewer.
127280	129000	Well, we'll talk about that in a little bit.
129000	132200	I've got to introduce, he doesn't play WoW, so if you're worried about this becoming the
132200	135500	Warcraft show, don't worry, we've got tons of other games tonight, Techmaster Loki's
135500	136500	in the house.
136500	137500	No, I don't play WoW.
137500	138500	To not talk about WoW.
138500	139500	I do not play WoW.
139500	144080	But he will talk about food, but we were a little concerned because you didn't bring,
144080	147420	like if you've listened to the show for any length of time, Loki always brings food with
147420	150180	him to the show from a random fast food place, but not tonight.
150180	152360	And I was like, are you feeling okay, Loki?
152360	153360	He brought with him a Red Bull.
153360	157520	Should have been two Red Bulls, because that Red Bull one, it's just not enough by itself.
157520	159200	Was the kid keeping you up last night?
159200	161400	No, it's just like drinking your Red Bulls.
161400	163560	Oh, I thought you needed energy.
163560	165560	Well, no.
165560	171960	It seriously allows me to concentrate and get more work done at work without being distracted
171960	172960	as much.
172960	175000	Because productivity gets way higher with Red Bull.
175000	178520	Now, hold on, or they're gonna have to start paying you to say that here on the show, so.
178520	181880	Well, they wanna pay me in like a big tub of Red Bull.
181880	184720	Get that little car to drive around and come give you some.
184720	188000	But Dark Sakura fed you some of her, I guess, extra dinner or whatever.
188000	189000	I don't know.
189000	190640	Were you just cooking for the fun of it?
190640	194800	I wanted beef stew because it's gotten cold outside.
194800	201500	And I had broth, you know, stuff to make broth out of, so I just made, I made a vegetable
201500	204960	broth in the crock pot overnight, and then I made the beef stew in the morning.
204960	207320	And crock pot cooking is in right now.
207320	209440	Like I notice a lot of people are like really into it.
209440	210880	It never went out.
210880	211880	It's easy.
211880	212880	I don't know why.
212880	213880	Like it just seems like I'm noticing it more.
213880	216640	The Paula Deen recipe for pot roast is amazing.
216640	217640	And I'm not just talking about-
217640	218640	How much butter?
218640	220520	There's not a lot of butter, but there's a lot of sodium.
220520	221800	A lot of sodium.
221800	224440	I see them more prevalent at Target.
224440	227080	I see it mentioned more on blogs, on Facebook.
227080	228080	I don't know.
228080	230080	Maybe it's the economy.
230080	234400	Well, honestly, it makes perfect sense because you can make a lot of food to last you for
234400	236800	a week in the crock pot.
236800	240960	You know, you can have it cook while you're at work or whatever, and you come home and
240960	241960	it's hot dinner.
241960	247320	It's like having your own, you know, servant, except you did all the work, but you didn't
247320	248320	cook it.
248320	249320	And you forgot that you did all the work.
249320	250320	It was cooked.
250320	252600	You come home and it's cooked, and it's good.
252600	253600	All right.
253600	256400	Well, believe it or not, we talk about more than food here on Orange Lounge Radio.
256400	259120	If it's your first time listening to the show, I'll just kind of reintroduce the show here
259120	260980	real quick because it's been a while.
260980	266800	We are three friends that all met about 10 years ago at this point, all playing a popular
266800	270160	video game at the arcades called Dance Dance Revolution.
270160	273040	And we used to go to these marathon sessions of playing that at the arcade, and we would
273040	276400	go to dinner afterwards with other friends, and we just sat around and talked shit about
276400	281480	video games, whether it be DDR or whatever else is at the arcade, for hours and hours
281480	282480	afterwards.
282480	286860	And I had been dabbling in internet radio, so at Dark Sakura before that.
286860	290900	And so we decided to kind of take that into an internet radio show, and Loki joined us
290900	291900	along the way.
291900	293700	And that's where Orange Lounge Radio was born.
293700	295880	We pride ourselves on the fact that we interact.
295880	296880	We do the show live.
296880	298180	We always have.
298180	299320	Very rare, we're not live.
299320	301660	Usually it has to be a computer issue or something.
301660	309920	But out of the 434 episodes we'd have, I'd say about 430 of those are probably live,
309920	312080	and interacting with you guys in our chat room.
312080	315280	We have you guys in chat giving live commentary on the show.
315280	317440	So you guys can call us later in the show.
317440	319880	We like to embrace new social media as it comes out.
319880	321200	So Facebook, we're on there.
321200	322200	Twitter, we're on there.
322200	323200	We give it a big kiss.
323200	325320	That's why we call it the show where every gamer has a voice.
325320	327660	Because, you know, we're not paid.
327660	331920	Very rarely are we sent advance review copies of things, or get free perks for this, because
331920	333740	we've always been very independent.
333740	336680	So we like to think we're giving you just a truly honest perspective.
336680	340000	And sometimes that honest perspective is, I don't have time this week to play every
340000	341440	single freaking game that's out right now.
341440	344640	I will say people do want to send us advance copies, we'll be happy to accept them.
344640	345640	Exactly.
345640	346640	Exactly.
346640	347640	I will never say no to that.
347640	349040	I don't care what it is.
349040	354080	But I will say this, is that the holiday season is upon us now, and that's kind of what I
354080	357600	wanted to move into, is the holiday season is upon us now, and we're in that month every
357600	360580	year in video games where everything is coming out.
360580	363920	And I just, I know you guys have got to be feeling this too.
363920	366520	I really don't have time to play everything.
366520	370040	And like I am a Warcraft player, as we were talking about at the beginning of the show,
370040	373380	and as if that didn't need enough time, like now there's all these other games out I'm
373380	377080	trying to play, and there's just not enough time.
377080	382000	And Skyrim is out on Friday, and I'm just thinking like, oh god, that's going to be
382000	389040	another suck in my time away, and I'm hearing it's great, which I was expecting, so yay,
389040	390520	I don't have enough time to play everything.
390520	394120	What games are you guys looking forward to this holiday season, if anything?
394120	396280	Dark Sakura, is there anything, maybe it's already out?
396280	398480	I'm looking forward to sleeping.
398480	402440	I'm looking forward to the semester being over, so I can actually play the shit I have.
402440	407880	Honestly, because, I mean, I started playing Symphony of the Night again, and I've just
407880	412400	been too tired to really play anything other than, you know, WoW and the other couple things
412400	413800	I'm playing.
413800	419720	It's honestly, if it comes out and it falls into my lap, I'll be happy to play it.
419720	426560	If it comes out and it's something that I want, I'll find a way to make it happen, but
426560	431900	right now, I'm just not really doing the looking forward to anything kind of deal, I'm doing
431900	436440	the get me through the next three weeks, we go to print next week.
436440	439440	This week, we go to print, fuck me, we go to print this week.
439440	440440	Oh my god.
440440	441440	IRL stuff.
441440	445040	Um, Loki, what are you looking forward to this holiday?
445040	448440	Like I had to ask, like I had to ask, and that's Tuesday, right?
448440	449440	Next Tuesday.
449440	450440	Oh, next Tuesday.
450440	453760	Do you have any special events lined up, like did you take Wednesday off work?
453760	455920	Do you have anything planned special?
455920	457720	No, I'm just gonna play it.
457720	459920	Nope, just gonna play it.
459920	460920	Just gonna play it.
460920	465240	Going to our chat room for some comments, chat.orangeslantrady.com, talking about the
465240	467160	free games that we don't get.
467160	473960	Dark Tetsuya says, Loki, would you play anything even if it's Skylanders 2?
473960	474960	Going back to what you said.
474960	478360	If you're gonna send me a free copy of that, I'll do something creative with those toys.
478360	482200	You know what, looking at Twitter, and kind of getting the feel for what people are saying,
482200	487120	I'm seeing a lot of positive stuff about it, especially from the people that have kids.
487120	489520	Really seem to enjoy, like Skylanders is a fun game to play with kids.
489520	493400	Glad that they were able to lower their standards for their kids.
493400	499500	Because you know, kids, they're definitely not attached to stupid toys nowadays, and
499500	504240	trust me, Activision is getting behind publishing games that are on the DS for a lot of those
504240	508600	stupid toys that you're just like, I don't understand why these kids like that.
508600	514600	But you know what, that's fine, and I understand, I'm not trying to sound like the bitter old
514600	519120	man or whatever that's like, oh, I don't understand these kids, I don't understand
519120	524200	these kids' games and their toys and blah blah blah, no seriously, their toys are stupid
524200	526080	compared to the stuff that we used to have.
526080	531280	I mean, our toys used to do stuff, I mean, it may have been stupid things like, you know,
531280	535080	karate chopping arm and stuff, but you know what, Teddy Ruxpin was the fucking future,
535080	536080	he could read anything.
536080	537880	I have a Teddy Ruxpin.
537880	539920	I know you do.
539920	540920	And Grubby.
540920	544000	And most of the...
544000	545000	My buddy.
545000	547480	Wherever you go, he goes.
547480	553520	I had one of those things, and man, his face is definitely hard, and you can do some serious
553520	556520	injuries to other people with that stuff.
556520	564880	No, but, I'm just saying, okay, Skylanders, you gotta, yeah, I understand your kids are
564880	570160	gonna have fun with that game, because it's like, oh look, the toys come to life, and
570160	574600	it's so much fun, but seriously, you as a responsible parent need to understand that
574600	579960	it's just a ploy to get you to buy the toys and this really expensive game that you don't
579960	580960	need.
580960	585640	Hell, you know what, buy your kids a good game, and buy them some other toys that are
585640	586640	also very good.
586640	591600	I just wanna say, for those that didn't have the privilege of growing up when, you know,
591600	596000	these old people here on this program grew up, just let me take you back a few years
596000	598720	here as to what we were into at the time.
598720	599720	Here you go.
599720	621240	Now, it wasn't necessarily into My Buddy, but my parents bought it for me.
621240	624240	It's just a giant fucking doll, okay, I mean, that's all it is.
624240	625240	It's just like...
625240	627960	Kid's sister's at a tea party, though.
627960	633600	I mean, it was just seriously, I mean, it could have been just a Cabbage Patch doll,
633600	634600	but...
634600	635840	That's probably what it was trying to capitalize on.
635840	636840	Seriously.
636840	637840	I had Cabbage Patch Kids.
637840	640480	Sorry for the poor audio on that, YouTube doesn't balance our ideas.
640480	642480	And I'm not saying that that toy was good.
642480	646720	That toy was not good at all, yeah, I recognize that it was, and yeah, Teddy Ruxpin was kind
646720	652160	of an interesting toy because that, you know, had, you know, it was a thing that played
652160	655000	tapes, you know, cassette tapes.
655000	659040	I know some kids that are maybe even listening to the show don't know what that is, but cassette
659040	667360	tapes, and they would actually move their mouth to the stuff, you know, the actual audio
667360	671460	because I think they had it split or something like that, and that's how it worked.
671460	675560	And it would read stories to you, and interact, they had the little playsets and stuff like
675560	676560	that.
676560	679600	And those are kind of cool, I mean, because at the time it was like pretty cutting edge
679600	680600	stuff.
680600	681600	But...
681600	686880	I'm sorry, I love this comment in our chat room, AlphaKananagram says, I had a My Buddy,
686880	690680	but then I saw a movie or clips of a Chucky movie and stopped playing with it.
690680	692080	Oh my god, you know what?
692080	694360	Can't say I blame you there.
694360	699760	Yesterday, and okay, I'm on the American River Review staff, and we sometimes go in on Saturdays
699760	701480	and Sundays to do extra work.
701480	703640	So we play movies.
703640	713200	And yesterday we were watching an MST3K movie that was called The Devil Doll, about this
713200	718200	mannequin and we just kept singing the My Buddy theme over and over every time the mannequin
718200	720480	would show up on the screen.
720480	723080	It's been so long since we've done a show, I didn't talk about the haunted house that
723080	724280	I went to a couple weeks ago.
724280	725280	Oh, talk about it.
725280	729360	Oh my god, okay, so we went to one of those cheesy haunted house things that they take
729360	733720	the old store that like one of the circuit cities that closed down, that they haven't
733720	736400	been able to get something else in there and they turned it into like this Uber haunted
736400	737400	house.
737400	738400	Right.
738400	742240	And one of the scarier ones that we went into, and I usually, usually like, you know, I kind
742240	746600	of approach this stuff with a haha, this stuff's derpy and dorky or whatever, but these guys
746600	747600	did a really good job.
747600	750820	And I can't remember the name of the haunted house, but it was out for the local folks
750820	754360	to Sacramento, California, it was out in Roseville, right across from the Dave and Busters out
754360	755360	there.
755360	757140	Like, I don't know what some furniture store used to be over there and they turned it into
757140	758480	a haunted house.
758480	765880	And they had one that was all Halloween themed or it was all Halloween themed stupid.
765880	770200	They had one that was all Hollywood themed and they had like all the recreations of the
770200	771320	different movies.
771320	775320	And like one of the rooms had a Chucky doll and like, it was really like scary and good
775320	776320	life.
776320	777320	And then it started moving.
777320	780200	They had a freaking midget as the Chucky doll.
780200	781200	That's awesome.
781200	782200	It started following you around.
782200	785600	It was like freaky and like, yeah, they were really good at scaring people because they
785600	788440	had, and this, this was the only way, like some people would do it.
788440	791080	They had a rule like a strip club.
791080	792080	We don't touch you.
792080	793080	You don't touch us.
793080	797840	Like there was a no touching rule, but they will get right up in your face and all this
797840	798840	stuff.
798840	800680	They had a Freddy Krueger that had like sparks coming out.
800680	801680	I mean, it was awesome.
801680	805400	It was really well done, but the Chucky doll, just the whole talk about that made me think
805400	806400	of this.
806400	807400	I will say this though.
807400	808480	They had all these different themed areas.
808480	810360	One of them was a hospital theme.
810360	813680	It was just like silent Hill and clearly had its inspiration.
813680	814920	I would have wanted to see that.
814920	815920	Oh my gosh.
815920	816920	Are there nurses?
816920	818400	Oh, well they didn't like have.
818400	820400	People in the silent Hill costume.
820400	825160	Like I don't, they didn't, but being in there definitely felt like it had the huge inspiration
825160	826160	from silent Hill.
826160	827160	Actually.
827160	828160	They did have some real cut up nurses.
828160	831360	They just didn't have like the face, like the face is wrapped in gauze type of thing.
831360	832360	They didn't really have that.
832360	836160	Well, that was only in, um, the movie that they had the face wrapped in gauze.
836160	840040	They had that in, um, they were faceless in a couple of the others and then just had
840040	841960	these kinds of modeled faces.
841960	844600	Don't, don't test me on my silent Hill.
844600	846040	I'm not, I'm not.
846040	850640	So one of the other things that truly scared me was the dentist in there cause like, you
850640	856920	know, the dentist is scary and had an air gun that you didn't know he had until it's
856920	860440	just the right person, which happened to be me walk by and you have the drilling noises
860440	866160	and all of a sudden, and I was like, that was exactly the sound you made.
866160	867160	Yeah.
867160	870600	You know, that's what happens when like 10 gay guys in their hag, I'll go to a haunted
870600	871600	house together.
871600	876080	You know, it's going back to the toys and you know, buying your kids, Skylanders and
876080	877080	stuff like that.
877080	878080	Okay.
878080	883920	Would you rather, you know, spend $200 on Skylanders and their, their toys or buy them
883920	890520	like, I mean $200 you can buy a really nice, you know, toy or something or a lot of toys
890520	895240	for $200 and I can guarantee they'll probably have a lot more fun than they do with Skylanders.
895240	900280	Yeah, that's a neat concept, but yeah, I mean, come on.
900280	902520	You can buy a cheap arcade cabinet for that.
902520	906360	One of my friends is building an arcade cabinet and it made me think of you actually.
906360	910320	I'm seeing all the pictures on Facebook and everything and it just totally, it totally
910320	914360	reminded me of when we lived together and you built that arcade cabinet that the TV
914360	915360	was in.
915360	916360	Yeah, it was a mistake.
916360	917640	Oh man, those were the days.
917640	924080	So since we're talking about cool toys that you could spend like $200 on, uh, did they
924080	929320	have this or do they have this now that they had when I was a kid?
929320	936800	Cause this is what I would spend $200 on.
936800	940200	Domino rally was the shit.
940200	943080	Like your dominoes would do like loop de loops.
943080	948360	Check out that awesome 80s power music to this commercial and like dominoes would go
948360	956640	down slides and this took all day to set up for like 10 seconds of fun.
956640	960240	Domino rally, get all three sets.
960240	963000	I would have spent $200 on domino rally.
963000	968920	All right, anyway, uh, I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks, but dark Sakura left,
968920	970240	so I guess we'll do things out of order.
970240	973200	Uh, we'll move into our gaming weeks, the types of video games that you have been playing
973200	974200	this week.
974200	977200	And Loki will start tonight with you since, um, dark soccer left the room real quick.
977200	980520	Her husband just got home, so I think she had to go tend to mainly grand theft auto
980520	981520	four usual.
981520	983880	Um, you know, still playing lost and damned.
983880	986120	We moved to airport games now.
986120	991760	And my coworker was getting slightly better at, uh, killing people in the airport.
991760	996560	And of course I refined my technique and now I'm up there with him again.
996560	1000920	Uh, but we're having some pretty high scoring games, like $3,000 games, which is pretty
1000920	1001920	awesome.
1001920	1007560	Um, and then of course, uh, actually played a little bit of saints road, the second or
1007560	1015960	saints row two on PC, uh, with a wonderful add on patch from, um, a group, uh, called
1015960	1017720	idle Ninja.
1017720	1023280	And they have a patch, uh, mod, if you will, called gentlemen of the row.
1023280	1028800	And what it does is it fixes a lot of stuff that's in, in the game that was buggy because
1028800	1035640	the saints row two PC version is a terrible, terrible port, but they fixed it for the most
1035640	1041760	part and they've added a lot of cool stuff to it, new weapons, new, um, you know, slider
1041760	1042760	abilities.
1042760	1044960	You can make your character look really ridiculous.
1044960	1050360	I had some like topless green chick that it was really hideous looking.
1050360	1054160	It was just like some, I don't even know what, and I actually, I'm going to start a new game
1054160	1056200	because I don't want to look at that character anymore.
1056200	1057280	It's just weird.
1057280	1065240	But um, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff and new gang types and clothing options and
1065240	1067480	just all sorts of crazy stuff.
1067480	1069920	And of course, you know, that's a free mod to download.
1069920	1073680	So worth checking out if you have the PC version cause it probably would fix a lot of the problems
1073680	1074680	that you have there.
1074680	1077060	Just gearing up, you know, for saints row the third, which hopefully I'll be playing
1077060	1078920	this week at some point.
1078920	1085040	And um, and then let's see, other than that, I played a plants versus zombies on the iPod
1085040	1086840	again and went back to that a little bit.
1086840	1090240	I'm on the roof now and they had a huge sale at Halloween time too.
1090240	1092200	I think you could get it for like 99 cents.
1092200	1093200	Yeah.
1093200	1094200	I mean, I liked the game.
1094200	1098760	It's, it's a little annoying that it just keeps ramping, like it keeps changing the
1098760	1100360	game like every single level.
1100360	1104000	Now mind it like, do you want the same stage as every level?
1104000	1105000	That would be boring.
1105000	1106000	No.
1106000	1108440	It just, it should get more difficult, you know, just like, I don't know.
1108440	1111440	They put new game mechanics in every stage.
1111440	1112440	Yes.
1112440	1113440	Exactly.
1113440	1114440	Um, and that's fine.
1114440	1116040	You know, it's pretty cool.
1116040	1121640	So I've been playing a little bit of that and then, um, what else?
1121640	1129480	Uh, that's pretty much it actually just not hold on, but I mean, I can't wait.
1129480	1134280	I'm just like, ah, I need the, I need the safe for the third.
1134280	1135280	I need it.
1135280	1138320	Hoping your distributor connections will come through and you can get the game early this
1138320	1139320	week.
1139320	1140320	We'll see.
1140320	1144680	After, after the week I've had, um, just next Sunday is going to be a big gaming week show
1144680	1145960	because hopefully look, you'll have that.
1145960	1149960	I'll have Skyrim, dark soccer will have, I don't know what she'll have, but it'll be
1149960	1150960	good.
1150960	1153600	I'll have a weekend that I can sleep through.
1153600	1154600	All right.
1154600	1155600	Dark soccer.
1155600	1158400	Uh, sorry we started without you, but we'll go back and do your gaming.
1158400	1159400	That's okay.
1159400	1160400	I had to potty.
1160400	1162600	Oh, I thought you ran out and said hi to Dan cause I already got home.
1162600	1163600	All right.
1163600	1164600	Well, what's up?
1164600	1165600	How was your gaming week?
1165600	1170720	Um, I played well and I played DC universe online, which is kind of ass.
1170720	1171720	You didn't like it?
1171720	1176080	Well, I'm not saying that I hated it, but the control is really crabby and I hate that
1176080	1179940	you have to keep turning the camera as you're running and doing everything.
1179940	1182400	And with my trackball mouse, it's just not reasonable.
1182400	1187920	I mean I could do it really easy in portal too, but I can't really do it for DC universe.
1187920	1188920	You know why?
1188920	1189920	Why?
1189920	1190920	Because it sucks?
1190920	1191920	Well, no, not because it sucks.
1191920	1192920	I mean maybe it sucks.
1192920	1193920	Cause trackball sucks.
1193920	1194920	I don't know how you do it.
1194920	1195920	I hate trackballs.
1195920	1202920	Mainly because I think the game is meant more to played with a controller than, cause using
1202920	1206480	like a right analog stick to control your camera is kind of natural for a lot of people.
1206480	1209840	You might want to give it another go with an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your computer
1209840	1213240	if you have any wired ones because the game will pick it right up because the game was
1213240	1217920	designed to be console slash, you know, kind of like Final Fantasy 11 was and you felt
1217920	1219720	more comfortable with that on the controller.
1219720	1221640	That might be the trick or it might not.
1221640	1222640	I don't know.
1222640	1223640	I mean DC universe is very different kind of game.
1223640	1226960	But I've also been playing more with keyboard and mouse so much lately and keep in mind
1226960	1230200	using a regular controller actually hurts my hands after awhile.
1230200	1235800	So I can't play a game for a long period of time like I can if you use keyboard and mouse.
1235800	1239160	You should try one of those things that look like a kickboard that they were pimping on
1239160	1241120	all games network awhile back.
1241120	1242120	Oh no.
1242120	1243120	That thing was painful.
1243120	1244120	Oh yeah.
1244120	1246120	We, we, uh, I gave them to you.
1246120	1251280	No, actually no you didn't, but I saw one at the store and it's too painful.
1251280	1252280	It's too bad.
1252280	1253280	It was painful.
1253280	1256640	I don't know if I remember seeing one, um, I don't remember what they're even called
1256640	1261240	now, but they look like they had all these weird, uh, almost like a spider like thing
1261240	1263060	over the controller that you hear.
1263060	1266720	It's supposed to improve your reaction time by like hitting the different buttons by kind
1266720	1269440	of moving your fingers in different ways and something like that.
1269440	1270440	Yeah, they're terrible.
1270440	1274120	My coworker just went home, uh, Brad from pod cultures in our chat room right now and
1274120	1276480	says a pack controls are just fine.
1276480	1277720	Use a 360 controller.
1277720	1283800	So another vote to, uh, try a controller, I guess I was again, I know, I know, but just,
1283800	1288200	I'm just saying, yeah, I mean, honestly I'm playing a PC game because I want to play a
1288200	1292880	PC game and you know, it's, it's fine.
1292880	1296520	There's also, I ran into way too many derps by the time I got through the brainiac thing.
1296520	1302400	I think right now is not a good time to get into DC universe.
1302400	1307040	You want to wait a month or two to be honest, it's going to be moot anyway cause star Trek
1307040	1308040	online.
1308040	1309040	True.
1309040	1312680	I was talking about this on Horde house, the Warcraft show I do this week and um, you know,
1312680	1316100	we had a guest on that was talking about the star Wars MMO that's coming out and he was
1316100	1319240	playing the beta of that and I said, there's no way in hell I'm playing this when it comes
1319240	1320240	out.
1320240	1321240	It's like, why not?
1321240	1322240	It's great.
1322240	1325000	I said, because you don't want to play any MMO in the first month when they, you know,
1325000	1329120	either launch a new expansion, launch the new game, launch free to play, whatever it
1329120	1332360	is, because it's just swarming with people.
1332360	1334040	You have to wait for it to kind of level out a little bit.
1334040	1342240	I think Star Trek online stayed pretty consistent because no one played Star Trek did, but you
1342240	1348960	had fans that were playing it and they were less derp than the usual derp, you know, and
1348960	1351880	I guess DC universe I would have hoped would have been the same, but everyone knows who
1351880	1353080	freaking Batman is.
1353080	1355720	But DC universe is also just a really different MMO.
1355720	1357880	Like it's not, wow, it's really not, wow.
1357880	1361840	It's more like, imagine if Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game was an MMO.
1361840	1368480	It's like playing city of heroes, but even worse control city of heroes is fine.
1368480	1372640	This way I could play Star Trek online because it played like city of heroes, which is no
1372640	1373640	problem.
1373640	1377240	But of course me and my Marvel love, I made a chick Hawkeye anyway.
1377240	1380920	I mean, her name is Hawk in Hebrew.
1380920	1386880	Maybe that was just your problem is you just couldn't, I've been enjoying watching Dan
1386880	1393800	play through, um, Arkham city Batman's Batman, you know, that, and I just think the whole
1393800	1397720	Batman cat woman thing is, I actually sat down and read two DC comics.
1397720	1398720	Wow.
1398720	1402320	I read the first two issues of the new cat man, not cat man, cat woman thing, because
1402320	1404120	it had Batman lucky in it.
1404120	1405120	Wow.
1405120	1406120	All right.
1406120	1407920	It was pretty hot too.
1407920	1409040	Anything else for your gaming week?
1409040	1411560	You want to share, um, Oh yeah.
1411560	1414020	Our type on the iPhone.
1414020	1415020	Really hard to control.
1415020	1419200	I was going to say, I mean, no, it's actually not hard to control, but like once it's like,
1419200	1420200	it's how I am with our type.
1420200	1423720	Anyway, once you lose those powerups, it's sort of like, Oh, what's the point?
1423720	1425920	I'm going to die in five seconds.
1425920	1430880	I am done playing classic games ported to the iPhone, but I like just listening to the
1430880	1431880	music on it.
1431880	1434840	I just, they all control rage too, by the way.
1434840	1435880	What if I played on the phone?
1435880	1436880	That's terrible.
1436880	1441080	I played street to rage two for free controls, terrible Sonic, terrible.
1441080	1443320	The Capcom arcade collection, terrible.
1443320	1444580	They're all terrible.
1444580	1446880	And it's because X-Men played pretty good.
1446880	1449360	Well, yeah, it's probably terrible too.
1449360	1450920	No, it was okay.
1450920	1453680	If freeze my phone, then it's terrible.
1453680	1459200	No, it was awesome because it was X-Men and it's prepared to die.
1459200	1460200	All right.
1460200	1466400	I also tried a little bit of crafted, which is the Minecraft knockoff on, um, the iPod
1466400	1467520	iPhone or whatever.
1467520	1468520	That's 2d.
1468520	1469520	Yeah.
1469520	1471960	I, I care about that as much as I care about Minecraft.
1471960	1475040	That's just like, Nope, don't care.
1475040	1476040	Try playing it.
1476040	1477040	Sounds like Terraria.
1477040	1478120	I also have something else.
1478120	1479120	Can I talk about it now?
1479120	1480120	What?
1480120	1482240	The other fun thing I've been playing with that isn't a game, but related to a game.
1482240	1485000	I've been playing with the well model viewer.
1485000	1486000	Why is that?
1486000	1487000	Just because you're obsessed with wow.
1487000	1491360	Well, because there's a web comic going to be coming out called called Hills Bread Blues.
1491360	1495360	Keep your eyes open everybody, but I bet I've been playing.
1495360	1498800	Actually I spent last night while my internet was down looking through all the different
1498800	1503480	models and finding like the unused ones and all the derp ones and finding like what the
1503480	1504480	spawners look like.
1504480	1507240	So if you see a bunny, be careful.
1507240	1508240	It could spawn something.
1508240	1513760	They use bunnies a lot for spawning things, but yeah, it's just kind of fun.
1513760	1519560	I found Alfred Copperworth and I found Alexandra McQueen.
1519560	1521960	So I'm just laughing at the NPC names.
1521960	1522960	Good times.
1522960	1523960	I think it's fun.
1523960	1524960	Yeah.
1524960	1525960	Let's see.
1525960	1526960	Let's see what makes my games tick.
1526960	1527960	Okay.
1527960	1532600	Um, my gaming week, I've played Warcraft as well, but I've played a heck of a lot of console
1532600	1533600	stuff too.
1533600	1535440	I want to talk about a few games I've been playing this week.
1535440	1539660	Um, the first I'll talk about is a game called Disney universe, which came out, um, a couple
1539660	1545080	of weeks ago and it's on, I think 360 and PS3 might be on PC as well.
1545080	1550400	It at first glance, it looks like a little big planet Disney game.
1550400	1553960	And I would say that's true to an extent, but the game itself plays more like a Lego
1553960	1554960	game.
1554960	1555960	Like if you played those.
1555960	1559200	I saw the trailer actually for the game when it was the ghostbusters and it's, and I've,
1559200	1561460	I've played the game a little bit and it's, it's cute.
1561460	1563440	It's a basic platformer.
1563440	1568420	Definitely something that like younger kids and tweens would get into those folks that
1568420	1573080	are expecting it to be like kingdom hearts and no, it's a lot more simple.
1573080	1576560	But if you're into Disney like I am and you like to collect things, cause the game has
1576560	1580240	a lot of collectibles, especially like powering up different suits.
1580240	1581500	Yes, there is a Tron suit.
1581500	1583400	That's why, you know, I had to go with that.
1583400	1584880	And it was also in the trailer.
1584880	1585880	Yeah.
1585880	1588320	And you know, there's, there's stuff from Pixar is involved too.
1588320	1591560	So there's definitely a lot of stuff to just kind of absorb, but the game itself is very
1591560	1592560	basic.
1592560	1596400	It's definitely not the depth of little big planet.
1596400	1600640	And therefore you have the $60 price tag, excuse me, I think it's actually a $50 price
1600640	1601640	tag.
1601640	1602640	It's $49.99.
1602640	1605860	I actually got three games from the Amazon buy two, get one free sale, which are the
1605860	1607400	games I'm talking about tonight.
1607400	1610880	And so I don't really know exactly how much they all work cause I paid like a hundred
1610880	1611880	dollars for free.
1611880	1612880	It's 50 bucks retail.
1612880	1617920	That's still asking a bit much, this is something that I think is going to be a great deal when
1617920	1620660	it's on sale for 20 or 30.
1620660	1624980	But if you're like really hardcore into Disney, or you really just want like a basic platformer
1624980	1627880	for fun, something with collectibles, I think you'd be into it.
1627880	1631960	But if you're looking for something a little more like a game with a lot more depth, I'm
1631960	1634280	not so sure you're going to find it here.
1634280	1638800	You definitely see the inspirations from little big planet, some of the mini games and so
1638800	1641720	forth, which are cute, but very basic.
1641720	1644800	The game is not anything you haven't played before.
1644800	1649380	It's just with Disney looking sack boy characters, cute.
1649380	1655040	A game that I played a bit more of was dance central two came out this past couple of weeks.
1655040	1659500	And yeah, it's, it's definitely an improvement over the original.
1659500	1663200	Some things I noticed right away, fitness mode, it's like 10 times better.
1663200	1667240	They have some prearranged fitness playlist that you can play, which I was having a lot
1667240	1668240	of fun with.
1668240	1672280	There's a story mode kind of built into it, which encourages you to mix up the songs a
1672280	1674280	little more too.
1674280	1679160	It's kind of okay to dabble into songs that are a higher difficulty on easy.
1679160	1682600	And I think the way the older game was structured, you really kind of felt like you had to kind
1682600	1686720	of go down the list of songs, but they, this one really kind of shuffles things in the
1686720	1688560	different modes a lot more.
1688560	1694000	Of course you can import all of your dance central one songs, but one thing that disappointed
1694000	1697600	me a little bit is that when you did that, and surely they had to know that there was
1697600	1699720	a lot of people that were going to do that.
1699720	1706280	It doesn't really integrate the dance central one stuff into the non arcade modes, like
1706280	1710400	the fitness mode and the, you know, well, you can do a nonstop fitness, you can do it,
1710400	1713480	but there aren't any like playlists that involve the dance central one stuff.
1713480	1716920	At least that I found now, granted, you know, if it's there, I'm sure someone in chat will
1716920	1720120	correct me here, but it wasn't immediately prevalent to me.
1720120	1723520	And I was just hoping it would be integrated maybe a little bit more, but I understand
1723520	1725160	they want to focus on the new stuff.
1725160	1733800	My other slight problem with dance central two is I don't think the song list is as strong
1733800	1735040	as the first game.
1735040	1739280	There's some good songs in there, but there's also some kind of really derpy songs as well.
1739280	1741260	Like there's a Justin Bieber song in there.
1741260	1745640	There's a Britney cover in there and it's like harmonics is better than covers.
1745640	1748640	Like I understand that Britney is very danceable and you want a Britney song in your game,
1748640	1750460	but you shouldn't have to resort to covers.
1750460	1751920	You can get another song.
1751920	1754600	There's danceable songs out there that are not Britney Spears.
1754600	1755600	And you know what?
1755600	1756760	People probably don't care.
1756760	1757760	Yeah.
1757760	1760160	So I mean, but there was, there were some songs that made me laugh.
1760160	1761840	Like there's had a ways, what is love?
1761840	1765000	And so it made me really laugh that that was in the game and yes, you do the head Bob is
1765000	1770520	part of it, but you know, that's the kind of thing you low for at parties, but you know,
1770520	1773720	once you've played it once, you don't really want to play that song over and over again,
1773720	1779580	but it did have some, it had some good songs, the dances.
1779580	1782380	You know what guys out there?
1782380	1788080	You're going to have to kind of let your inhibitions go for some of these dances because I'm all
1788080	1793960	I have to say, if you play born this way by lady Gaga, expect to do moves like princess
1793960	1800600	snaps and um, something about queen, like where you make the little crown, like she
1800600	1802660	does in the video, if you've ever seen the board in this way video, they kind of put
1802660	1804000	that dance move in there.
1804000	1807160	So like I can just imagine a bunch of bros playing dance central too.
1807160	1811480	I mean, not that that's really like the broski kind of game to be playing anyway, but let's
1811480	1815960	just say that, you know, it found its way out at a frat party.
1815960	1821520	Like if you want to impress the ladies, expect to really let your inhibitions go with some
1821520	1822520	of these dances.
1822520	1824880	Women like a man that's secure in his sexuality.
1824880	1825880	That's very true.
1825880	1826880	That's very true.
1826880	1832820	So I'm just, I'm just saying it's a lot of the dances struck me as very feminine.
1832820	1837160	I didn't find a lot of masculine dances, but whatever.
1837160	1838960	Take that as it is.
1838960	1839960	Have fun.
1839960	1840960	That's all it is.
1840960	1843520	Have your own home, uh, the fitness modes and stuff.
1843520	1844520	It's a lot of fun.
1844520	1847920	And so what, if you have to do princess snaps, it's funny.
1847920	1852680	Um, the other game I've been playing a lot of, well, actually not a lot of, I just started
1852680	1857400	it today, but I really want to go home and play more of it is Arkham city.
1857400	1858600	Isn't it great?
1858600	1859920	Is really good.
1859920	1860920	Yeah.
1860920	1863440	Um, I, you know, again, I'm only about maybe like an hour and a half into it, so I can't
1863440	1868760	like totally review it, but I'll just say like, usually when I leave OLR, I want to
1868760	1869760	go home and play.
1869760	1870760	Wow.
1870760	1872040	I want to go to the city because I'm like really into it.
1872040	1877360	And the story, I say this, the story just get, I loved that you had like five villains
1877360	1881440	within the first 15 minutes, but it didn't feel, it didn't feel like overload.
1881440	1883260	It felt like it made sense of the story.
1883260	1884260	It was good.
1884260	1889520	Um, yeah, I love that it's open world now and that there's all these side quest things
1889520	1890520	you can do.
1890520	1894640	And it just, it's just, it's more fluid than the last one to me even like, I can't even
1894640	1895640	put my finger on it.
1895640	1898680	Like it's just, it's like, yeah.
1898680	1899680	And that's really rad.
1899680	1902160	Like that's, Oh man, I'll tell you something too.
1902160	1908940	As you finish certain parts of the game, you actually, um, the dialogue amongst the inmates
1908940	1913120	in the game will change that you overhear reflecting things that have happened in the
1913120	1914160	game.
1914160	1918280	So it's just not the same stale thing and you'll find different people in different
1918280	1924200	areas and all the Joker trophy, not Joker, the, uh, the Riddler trophies.
1924200	1925440	Those are hard.
1925440	1927160	Some of those, some of them are just cake.
1927160	1931560	They're right there, but some of them are really hard and, but the Catwoman switching
1931560	1933640	out is actually pretty neat.
1933640	1936680	So you'll get points that you can switch out with Catwoman.
1936680	1937680	Very cool.
1937680	1938680	Yeah.
1938680	1939800	I put in the code to get that.
1939800	1946920	So the game starts right away with a Catwoman based thing and you know, it's, it's, you're
1946920	1947920	into it.
1947920	1948920	It's, it's cool.
1948920	1951320	So I, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm into it into that.
1951320	1953200	I have to laugh.
1953200	1957360	There's a move with Batman that you do that you start running, you slide under a door.
1957360	1961440	She does the slide under the door thing, except she does it on her knees leaning back.
1961440	1968340	So you get this flash of boob when every time you do it in the movie where she slides under
1968340	1970120	a door like that or something like that.
1970120	1971840	Well, new movies not out yet.
1971840	1972840	We don't have returns.
1972840	1976960	I don't think she did that.
1976960	1979800	And on top of that, she didn't have the cleavage in Batman Returns.
1979800	1986520	I mean, Batman Returns was what, 1993 full body black suit and this is the zip up jumpsuit
1986520	1991960	Catwoman and like when, when cat, when that movie came out, Bane wasn't even in the Batman
1991960	1992960	universe yet.
1992960	1993960	I don't think so.
1993960	1998280	You know, a lot's changed since then, but, um, yeah, I, I'm, I'm having a really good
1998280	2000800	time with it, so I can't wait to go home and play more of it.
2000800	2004120	It's um, we're having a good time, so yeah.
2004120	2007280	Um, slick interface too.
2007280	2009480	Like even right away from the menus, I was like, this is really cool.
2009480	2011920	And I want to play the 3D.
2011920	2015920	It has like 3D where it's, um, you can just use red and blue glasses or some type of,
2015920	2019560	I don't know, I think some other type of glasses I'm sure they're selling, but uh, yeah, you
2019560	2021800	can get 3D with a 2D TV, which is kind of cool.
2021800	2027840	It's, I have to say that the whole thing is actually a very well done package.
2027840	2028840	Mm hmm.
2028840	2032060	Now Leo Shannon in our chat room says, yeah, but when you play Catwoman, they all refer
2032060	2034080	to her, to her as bitch.
2034080	2037800	Well, yeah, they call Batman the bat.
2037800	2044040	They are, well, I mean, bitch is a little bit more derogatory, but I mean, I, well,
2044040	2048560	whereas maybe they could use a little more variety in their derogative terms, I do get
2048560	2053840	the sense that they're taunting Batman as well, but I haven't played as Catwoman much
2053840	2058140	more than the opening sequence yet, but if they do just keep saying bitch, bitch, bitch,
2058140	2061060	that does seem a little bit lazy to me.
2061060	2063640	Pretty much, or they'll say it's the cat or Catwoman.
2063640	2067520	I mean, they call her by name, but they also say, I mean, the first thing, if you've got
2067520	2071640	a woman who's being annoying to you, what's the first thing you're going to call her?
2071640	2072640	Bitch.
2072640	2073640	Exactly.
2073640	2075800	If there's a man being annoying to me, the first thing I think to call them is bitch
2075800	2076800	too.
2076800	2077800	You know?
2077800	2078800	Yeah.
2078800	2079800	Maybe I'm just an equal opportunity bitcher.
2079800	2081320	Call him dick.
2081320	2085200	But keep in mind this too, they might be calling you a bitch, but you're about ready to kick
2085200	2086480	their ass.
2086480	2092140	The one tiny negative I will say about Batman, granted I'm playing it on easy cause I really
2092140	2093820	just want the story.
2093820	2099220	It is a little bit button mashy, but it's button mashing with finesse.
2099220	2100220	If that makes sense.
2100220	2103560	Like it just, it's very fluid and it's cool.
2103560	2105860	Like it's not to the point where I find it annoying.
2105860	2108920	It's button mashy in the way that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game was
2108920	2111040	button mashy and it was still fun.
2111040	2112280	So that's all.
2112280	2116260	I was also, I have to say that I really liked the artwork that's come out with the game.
2116260	2120400	I'm sure on the harder modes, there's more to it than just button mashing, but I am playing
2120400	2121400	it on easy.
2121400	2125360	Anyway, there you go.
2125360	2126600	That's pretty much been my gaming week.
2126600	2130080	Let's talk about some housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.
2130080	2133320	Quickly for the live listeners, I guess we just had a bit of an outage where we went
2133320	2134320	down.
2134320	2135320	We all get kicked from IRC.
2135320	2140040	Dark Sakura, the house of Dark Sakura has been having some internet issues up and down.
2140040	2144680	So for the sake of having a clean podcast, we are going to try and just tear straight
2144680	2148280	through without really stopping because of downtimes.
2148280	2152120	So we apologize to the live listeners, but it is an issue that's out of our control.
2152120	2154900	Like Dark Sakura, you said your net's gone down like what, three times over the weekend
2154900	2157820	and affected your rating in WoW last night?
2157820	2162200	It's gone down off and on over the last three days and I thought that it was finally stable
2162200	2169320	and we got all the way through ICC ice crumbs for those who don't know and get to Arthas
2169320	2172600	and then it starts freezing on me and I knew it was going to go down again.
2172600	2174500	No porn torrents.
2174500	2177520	So we really thank, I've already downloaded Supernatural.
2177520	2180240	We really thank the live listeners for tuning in and sticking it out.
2180240	2181240	We apologize.
2181240	2184640	We can't fix it, but it is an issue with our internet service provider.
2184640	2188480	So for the sake of having a clean show, we're just going to try and push right through.
2188480	2190600	If we go down, we are probably aware.
2190600	2195280	So no need to send me 50 tells that we're down because we probably know.
2195280	2198600	Also, I'll say this real quick.
2198600	2203480	Podcast award results came out and we didn't win, which, you know, you have to prepare
2203480	2206080	yourself for the fact that you probably won't win.
2206080	2209360	The same show that won for the past couple of years, four player podcast, they won again,
2209360	2210960	which is, you know, good for them.
2210960	2212300	They work hard on what they do.
2212300	2216220	It's an independent show and we always said from the top, we want an indie show to win
2216220	2217800	and indie show did win.
2217800	2219040	So that's awesome.
2219040	2224520	And not only did they win the gaming one, they won the grande taco.
2224520	2225520	They didn't win grande taco.
2225520	2228320	It was something like best produced or best overall.
2228320	2232160	I don't know, but they, they have a big community, a strong community.
2232160	2236800	And so, you know, they, they had the votes getting cranked out every day.
2236800	2240600	The podcast awards are a little bit of a popularity contest, so it really is about kind of who's
2240600	2242280	got the most driven community.
2242280	2244480	And obviously they've got a strong community.
2244480	2245560	That's not me throwing shade.
2245560	2247280	That is they, that's great.
2247280	2249880	They've worked hard to build that up.
2249880	2255160	Not that our community is any less because you guys, we were so thankful that you guys
2255160	2260380	were putting out their call for retweets and posting on Facebook.
2260380	2263920	Other all game shows were showing support for us, which really meant a lot.
2263920	2268560	You guys, we saw, you know, we saw the plugs on other folks' website and the banners that
2268560	2272360	were like, Hey, our show is not nominated, but go vote for these guys.
2272360	2275840	Cause you know, we like them and you know, we're, we're on the same network.
2275840	2277080	And that really meant a lot.
2277080	2280460	And I'll also say what also meant a lot to us throughout this whole thing.
2280460	2286000	That was awesome was that over on Facebook we actually posted, you know, the other night
2286000	2289680	when we found out about the results, we kind of, you know, said, Hey, we didn't win, but
2289680	2291020	you know, it's cool.
2291020	2296000	At least we were nominated, you know, out of what, hundreds of gaming podcasts out there.
2296000	2299600	We were one of 10 nominated and only half of them were general gaming shows.
2299600	2303480	A lot of them were very specialized shows about Warcraft or other MMOs or what have
2303480	2304800	you.
2304800	2307240	So that was just really awesome to even have that.
2307240	2310560	And the response we got on Facebook was just awesome.
2310560	2314700	Like we got some comments on the posts like, uh, that by the way, this is at facebook.com
2314700	2315700	slash orange lounge radio.
2315700	2317200	If you're not a friend, you should add us.
2317200	2320880	Like Terry replied and said, you won my award and that's all that matters.
2320880	2325800	Six plus years and still listening, uh, Fabrice commented on the post saying, I'd even say
2325800	2330200	you won our hearts making such a great podcast for so many years is quite an accomplishment
2330200	2336720	and like stuff like that is makes my heart warm for just a moment.
2336720	2343280	It does, but yeah, stuff like that is longer than a moment, Rob, what are you thinking?
2343280	2346400	So I just want to say thank you guys so much.
2346400	2351360	Everybody who supported us, even though we didn't win, it's all good.
2351360	2354120	We're still here and we don't have any plans to go anywhere.
2354120	2360160	So and so, um, that's it for housekeeping.
2360160	2363860	Uh, if, as I mentioned, facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, twitter, twitter.com
2363860	2366840	slash O L R and now the gaming news.
2366840	2367840	Loki.
2367840	2368840	Uh, yes.
2368840	2375360	Um, so this week was pretty big, at least for me cause Hey, they, they put out a trailer
2375360	2378020	for grant that out of five and that makes me happy.
2378020	2384840	So yeah, so they pretty easily guessed a sequel to grant those out of four.
2384840	2391300	Uh, now it's of course returning back to Los Santos as part of a grand theft auto San Andreas.
2391300	2397520	This time I believe those supposed to be centralized more around one city as opposed to three like
2397520	2402920	San Andreas was and um, mainly because you know, now they can really expand it and it
2402920	2403920	looks just amazing.
2403920	2409560	Of course, the rumors, you know, everyone's trying to dissect a trailer, figure out, okay,
2409560	2412280	what's, what's this going to be about?
2412280	2413560	Where are the new things in there?
2413560	2418260	Some of the things that you see in the trailer, um, animals, there's a dog lease in a cut
2418260	2419260	scene.
2419260	2422800	I'm not sure if you're going to be able to kill animals, but obviously in their last
2422800	2426840	game red dead redemption, there were plenty of animals running around that you could kill.
2426840	2430200	That would be really risky for them to do that and incur the wrath of PETA.
2430200	2433960	And I know you guys don't care about that stuff, but that is a bunch of like negative
2433960	2434960	publicity.
2434960	2435960	I think the game could do without.
2435960	2436960	Yeah.
2436960	2440480	Isn't that funny that people will get more bent out of shape about killing animals than
2440480	2441480	they will killing people.
2441480	2445000	I would have thought that that would have happened from red dead redemption and granted
2445000	2448360	it's period specific, but I mean if you think about it, it's not like you're going around
2448360	2449640	killing people's dogs.
2449640	2453240	It's like, okay, they may be having, you know, police dogs coming after you or something
2453240	2457040	like that or there might be wolves or something in the hills and you have to defend yourself
2457040	2458040	or whatever.
2458040	2462120	It's just people get very possessive about their cats and dogs almost more so than they
2462120	2463120	do people.
2463120	2464120	So.
2464120	2465120	Oh, the PETA people are crazy.
2465120	2466880	Well, I'm not, I'm not just saying PETA.
2466880	2470240	Like if they're going to work that stuff into the game, they better tread carefully.
2470240	2471240	That's all I'm saying.
2471240	2474360	It's a, it's a, it's a volatile ground they're walking with that.
2474360	2480160	Some of their stuff, um, of course, you know, planes coming back, uh, a lot more, uh, aircraft
2480160	2481160	in there.
2481160	2482680	Uh, a blimp is in there.
2482680	2487320	Who knows if you can fly a blimp, but definitely it was something that was part of the, uh,
2487320	2490120	you know, skyline that was kind of cool.
2490120	2495680	Um, very variety, you know, there's a huge variety of landscapes there, everything from
2495680	2499320	like the mountains to, you know, the city slums.
2499320	2503360	They showed kind of three different characters in there that you might be playing as.
2503360	2509080	One of those, the rumor to be, um, the main character from Vice City coming back.
2509080	2515560	Um, and then also there looks like maybe CJ from San Andreas and then a new character,
2515560	2518800	um, all making the return maybe to this game.
2518800	2520360	Uh, at least that's all rumor stuff.
2520360	2526600	Um, of course, multiplayer is going to be a big part of it as well and, um, no word
2526600	2530200	of course on any sort of, uh, release time frame.
2530200	2537240	Although if I were to be, you know, a guessing man, I'd say, uh, fourth quarter 2012, just
2537240	2542000	in time for the Wii U launch, it would be a good timing if they want to Grand Theft Auto
2542000	2543000	on their platform.
2543000	2547240	Sorry, can I say this about the pet discussion we were having a minute ago, Akuma JP in our
2547240	2550440	chat room says, don't worry, all dogs go to heaven.
2550440	2554000	It's true, it's true.
2554000	2555640	Cats on the other hand, no, I'm just kidding.
2555640	2556640	I love kitties.
2556640	2557640	I love all cats.
2557640	2558640	Good thing Shirmi's not in here.
2558640	2559640	All cats go to special heaven.
2559640	2561320	She should make that face at you.
2561320	2562760	Cats, no, cats go to special heaven.
2562760	2563760	All right.
2563760	2564760	Sorry, Loki.
2564760	2565760	Yeah.
2565760	2567840	So, um, but yeah, it's seriously amazing.
2567840	2570960	If you haven't seen the trailer for whatever reason, go check it out.
2570960	2576240	Rockstar games.com and uh, I can't wait to play it.
2576240	2577880	It'll, it'll be awesome.
2577880	2579440	And how many times did you watch the trailer?
2579440	2581880	About 10, 15 times.
2581880	2585520	People are really dissecting even just every little frame of that kind of like a movie
2585520	2586520	trailer though.
2586520	2591480	There's some really stupid people out there like, Hey, look at that address that's on
2591480	2592480	there.
2592480	2593480	That means it's coming out in May.
2593480	2595000	I'm like, no, you're stupid.
2595000	2597680	I'm a bit frightened now.
2597680	2598680	What?
2598680	2601080	Her last name is wooly Bush.
2601080	2602080	Stop it.
2602080	2603080	That's not related to the topic at hand.
2603080	2604720	I'm going to make you close that.
2604720	2605720	Okay.
2605720	2606720	All right.
2606720	2610600	Moving on to other news that does not have to do with dark soccer.
2610600	2612960	Looking at the model viewer when she should be looking at her next story.
2612960	2614480	Uh, looked at my story.
2614480	2615840	What are you talking about?
2615840	2616960	I want to talk about this.
2616960	2620880	This is a game I don't think anyone in here has looked at funny enough because I don't
2620880	2626440	think a one, excuse me, this is not usually the type of game we play, but he wanted to
2626440	2627440	play.
2627440	2631040	5 million, actually 5 million to be exact people out there that are playing this game
2631040	2632040	this week.
2632040	2633040	It's battlefield three.
2633040	2636040	It is huge in the gaming industry.
2636040	2640840	5 million gamers throughout the world bought battlefield three this week.
2640840	2643000	That is internal estimates from EA.
2643000	2647840	So that could be a little bit inflated, but to be honest, I wouldn't put it past that.
2647840	2651600	That is actually the legit number.
2651600	2657760	I guess at one point they were announcing that they moved 10 million units onto shelves.
2657760	2661320	So this game is preparing to sell a lot more through the holiday season.
2661320	2664640	So yep, I know a lot of my friends were playing this game.
2664640	2668840	Even though I am terrible, terrible bad at first person shooters, I totally understand
2668840	2669880	why people are into this.
2669880	2671760	These games look phenomenal.
2671760	2675520	The graphics are outstanding.
2675520	2681560	And as far as the multiplayer experience goes, where you get to shoot, shoot, shoot to kill,
2681560	2682560	it's a lot of fun.
2682560	2686360	So, but Loki, you're trying to get this right now or what?
2686360	2693400	Well, I was looking to maybe try it, at least the single player because it looked fun.
2693400	2699400	Now, I was hearing a lot of buzz on Twitter that some people are really having problems
2699400	2702400	with some of the origin integration and so forth.
2702400	2706440	And you know, the servers were having a hard time, which I guess is to be expected the
2706440	2707720	launch week of a game.
2707720	2711720	You know, the servers are always having hiccups and so forth, but it sounds like there's a
2711720	2714680	lot of rabble rabble about the origin integration.
2714680	2718740	I want to say I was reading something about a crack has already come out for the PC version.
2718740	2723680	Of course, this wouldn't affect the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 ones, but the PC one specifically,
2723680	2727040	I guess a crack has come out that has now disabled the origin.
2727040	2730720	Like you don't need it anymore, which is not a surprise at all.
2730720	2731720	I'll tell you this.
2731720	2735920	I didn't talk about this at the top of the show, but you guys know my Xbox was hacked
2735920	2736920	a couple months ago.
2736920	2739400	I got on the show, lost some money.
2739400	2744360	I played the demo for need for speed, the run this week, because that's a game I'm actually
2744360	2747960	looking forward to, but I don't play a lot of EA sports games.
2747960	2752180	The only EA sports games I really get into these days are the racers.
2752180	2756240	So the reason why I bring that up, when I logged into need for speed, the run, it told
2756240	2761000	me that my Xbox live gamer tag had already been tied to an email account that wasn't
2761000	2762000	mine.
2762000	2763000	It belonged to somebody else.
2763000	2767920	In fact, I was able to Facebook that person and see what she looked like and wonder if
2767920	2770240	that was the person that maybe took my money.
2770240	2772160	Well, FIFA is an EA game.
2772160	2773160	I know.
2773160	2776320	I know FIFA is an EA game and this person made the account on there.
2776320	2777640	Now, I don't know.
2777640	2780600	The hacker could have just used a random email address.
2780600	2781600	Well they would.
2781600	2783840	It was interesting that I was able to look this person up on Facebook.
2783840	2785520	You need to confirm it though.
2785520	2786520	Like I don't know.
2786520	2787520	They do.
2787520	2788520	Yeah, you have to do three mil.
2788520	2789520	Well, here's what I ended up doing.
2789520	2796120	I called EA to get that unattached, to get my real EA account attached to my gamer tag
2796120	2800360	because I wanted my actual one on there and I wanted that one unattached.
2800360	2805760	I was on hold for 25 minutes waiting to speak to somebody over there.
2805760	2808640	But granted, I'm calling the week the battlefield three comes out.
2808640	2812920	So I wasn't too, you know, that's what speakerphone was invented for and you know, so I can sit
2812920	2814960	and play Warcraft while I'm on speakerphone.
2814960	2817240	But that was a little bit irritating.
2817240	2823440	I will say this, and yet again, somebody posted on our Orange Launch Radio wall, I feel for
2823440	2824440	you, Sky.
2824440	2825840	I just got hacked this week.
2825840	2829920	And my response was, dude, we told you change your password.
2829920	2833400	So people out there on Xbox, please, please change your password.
2833400	2836520	And this is what I'm going to honestly recommend you do.
2836520	2842100	Go download the demo for either NBA Jam or Need for Speed The Run, especially Need for
2842100	2843100	Speed The Run.
2843100	2845320	If you like racer games like it all, like check that one out because that's actually
2845320	2846320	kind of rad.
2846320	2849560	The snow level is pretty awesome.
2849560	2855120	Check out the demo because when you play the demo, you can attach an EA account.
2855120	2859640	And I would think if you could do that in advance, it might help against the hackers.
2859640	2866240	Like I'm not sure, again, nobody knows what they're doing besides charging up these money.
2866240	2870020	I think they're loading up Xbox Live accounts and then trying to sell them or something.
2870020	2872400	So I don't know what it is they're really doing.
2872400	2874720	So it's hard to say what measures to take to prevent it.
2874720	2879240	Well, what they're doing is I think is like you can download that content to your console
2879240	2881040	and then you don't need that account anymore.
2881040	2884800	It's like kind of downloading a full version of a game, I don't know.
2884800	2891840	I will say this, everybody I know who got hacked, none of them play EA sports games.
2891840	2894520	And it's just an interesting trend I'm noticing.
2894520	2898440	So go get your Xbox Live account attached to an EA account.
2898440	2902680	I hate that I'm telling you to go sign up for an EA account because in a perfect world,
2902680	2907600	I would be saying, clearly there's an issue here that nobody's admitting to, which is
2907600	2915840	infuriatingly difficult, but go do it because you don't want to lose $150 like one of our
2915840	2917380	other listeners did this week.
2917380	2919920	So please, please don't be like us.
2919920	2923460	Change your Xbox Live password now if you haven't already.
2923460	2927120	And you know what, take the extra precaution and attach an EA account to it through the
2927120	2931360	need for speed to run demo or any EA sports demo that's out there.
2931360	2933880	There you go.
2933880	2937000	Tekniss in our chat room disagrees with me.
2937000	2941120	Need for speed to run looks horrible, but it uses the EA login for all their games via
2941120	2942120	origin.
2942120	2946600	I played it on 360, not PC, so I didn't have the whole origin thing, but I kind of liked
2946600	2947600	it.
2947600	2948600	It was cool.
2948600	2949600	I don't know.
2949600	2950600	But I like racing games too.
2950600	2951600	I like arcade racers like that.
2951600	2955900	Like I can't do Forza or Gran Turismo, but I can totally do need for speed and burnout.
2955900	2958080	So that's just me.
2958080	2959080	All right.
2959080	2963760	Ikuma JP asks in our chat room, is EA the hacker?
2963760	2964760	Who knows?
2964760	2965760	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
2965760	2967640	They do like money.
2967640	2969960	Let's move on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.
2969960	2975360	Well, as I mentioned earlier, this is a game that I've been playing sort of as DC Universe
2975360	2976640	Online.
2976640	2984040	It's gone free to play and it's been sending the game down for maintenance off and on,
2984040	2986440	which I've actually run into myself.
2986440	2994600	But you can actually go download it through the Sega Online Entertainment launcher and
2994600	2997640	the game's being revamped to handle the people.
2997640	3008240	And also their user numbers have hit 330,000 players, which is a 600% increase.
3008240	3011620	This is pretty crazy.
3011620	3015880	Meaning that everybody went to check this game out the minute it went free to play.
3015880	3016880	Yeah.
3016880	3017880	I mean, I was curious.
3017880	3018880	I checked it out.
3018880	3020320	I know a lot of people that did.
3020320	3021320	Don't care for it.
3021320	3024240	I'm not going to play it anymore, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't have paid for it.
3024240	3025240	I'll tell you this.
3025240	3027120	I would have been really pissed if I'd been paying for it.
3027120	3030400	I played it during the beta and I liked it enough where I would have played it more,
3030400	3033440	but I didn't want to be paying for multiple MMOs because I think at the time I was playing
3033440	3036320	the beta, I was playing for wow and something else.
3036320	3039240	And I don't remember what it was, but I, yeah, I didn't want to add another one into the
3039240	3042320	mix, so I didn't go through with it and I was really happy when they announced they
3042320	3043760	went free to play.
3043760	3047760	But then I heard the first day just that the servers are crashing left and right, which
3047760	3048760	doesn't surprise me.
3048760	3049760	So I'm going to wait.
3049760	3053760	Well, the login's taking forever and it would like freeze at the loading your character
3053760	3054760	screen.
3054760	3057000	I was just like, you know what, this isn't worth it to me.
3057000	3062240	I'm already paying for one game that I like and another game that I like is coming out
3062240	3063240	free to play.
3063240	3064240	So why am I worried?
3064240	3066040	I'll still check out DC Universe.
3066040	3068700	I like the idea that it's a console MMO.
3068700	3074120	I might get it on PS3, although all my friends are on PC, just because, I don't know, I like
3074120	3076920	the idea of an MMO on my console.
3076920	3078920	Kind of fun.
3078920	3080440	I like DC Universe well enough.
3080440	3081440	I'll check it out now.
3081440	3082840	It's free to play.
3082840	3083840	I'm not as humbuggy.
3083840	3087240	All right, let's move on with some more news.
3087240	3097080	All right, so this is kind of sad, I guess, but Silicon Knights, they've cut their staff
3097080	3103440	by nearly 75%, going from almost 100 people down to 25, and of course they just released
3103440	3109360	X-Men Destiny, which didn't really get that great reviews, and Too Human, which really
3109360	3111040	didn't get good reviews.
3111040	3119520	So yeah, that might be a good reason why they're cutting.
3119520	3126560	But yeah, apparently it has been confirmed that they had those layoffs, and although
3126560	3132000	they're saying that the number is actually maybe a little bit lower than that, because
3132000	3135380	they're also creating new jobs as well.
3135380	3138960	So I don't know.
3138960	3146520	It's interesting that these cuts have to happen, but I guess since they just finished the game
3146520	3150080	and it didn't do that well, so they can't.
3150080	3157200	Sadly this is kind of what happens a lot lately, which doesn't make the news any better to
3157200	3158200	report.
3158200	3163240	Yeah, I mean it's just, I'm not surprised.
3163240	3168040	I thought X-Men Destiny looked all right, but apparently it seemed rushed, and maybe
3168040	3176080	that's not necessarily the fault of them, but I kind of think it might be a little bit,
3176080	3180080	or a little bit to blame, because I mean look at Too Human, a game that was delayed and
3180080	3184520	delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed, and it still sucked when it came out.
3184520	3189760	So I don't know if more time would have actually helped them in this case, but it probably
3189760	3192700	didn't help that they were a little short in time.
3192700	3197000	I guess the silver lining though is that a lot of times when these studios have these
3197000	3201320	massive layoffs, the big people kind of go tend to form their own new company.
3201320	3206840	Like that kind of happened with Bazaar recently, which I still cannot believe that they shut
3206840	3208080	that studio down.
3208080	3210040	I mean I do and I don't.
3210040	3213240	Like it was horrible.
3213240	3218320	But you know, they go start a new company and it might turn out okay.
3218320	3221320	Another company that have some layoffs, Gameforge.
3221320	3231000	They're kind of known for doing some browser-based games, but also they dropped their staff from
3231000	3234360	450 down to 350.
3234360	3240080	And of course they've recently cancelled a few different games, Mythos and Hellbreed,
3240080	3244560	and I guess they're not sure if they're going to be able to finish now a, it was supposed
3244560	3250960	to be a free-to-play or a freemium Star Trek game, Star Trek Infinite Space, that they
3250960	3253360	were going to be co-publishing.
3253360	3257440	I wonder if Star Trek Online going free-to-play somehow ended up being a conflict of interest
3257440	3258440	with this.
3258440	3261160	Just a random thought, I don't know.
3261160	3262160	Maybe.
3262160	3263160	I don't know.
3263160	3264160	I mean it looks kind of cool.
3264160	3268480	I don't know much about it though, it's kind of the first time I've heard of it.
3268480	3271880	And of course their comment is, you know, through a more efficient, organized structure
3271880	3278600	we can optimize our use of resource and greater fluff, fluff, PR fluff, fluff, fluff, fluff,
3278600	3280800	trying not to sound evil and terrible.
3280800	3281800	Fluff fluff.
3281800	3282800	Yeah.
3282800	3283800	Which.
3283800	3286800	It's all of like, well we gotta cut costs so we're gonna have more people, or less people
3286800	3287800	doing more.
3287800	3288800	Yeah.
3288800	3292000	I've heard that one over and over and over again.
3292000	3293000	Yeah.
3293000	3294000	It's unfortunate.
3294000	3297120	Once you get down to like five jobs per person, then yeah.
3297120	3301000	Let's hope these guys maybe can team up with the other ones who just got laid off and hopefully
3301000	3305000	start a new studio that makes some awesome things that's better managed.
3305000	3306000	Let's hope.
3306000	3307000	Let's hope.
3307000	3308000	Mm-hmm.
3308000	3309000	Alright.
3309000	3313960	Anyhow, moving on with some more game news that hopefully is a little less depressing.
3313960	3316640	Well if you're a Sony fan this is actually pretty exciting news.
3316640	3323320	The PlayStation 3 is catching up to the Xbox 360 in terms of shipments.
3323320	3325520	Quarter 2, it was reported of fiscal.
3325520	3332780	Fiscal Quarter 2 2011, it was reported that Sony has sold 3.7 million PS3 units around
3332780	3335960	the world and that quarter ended September 30th.
3335960	3342340	So they have sold thus far 55.5 million units and they're improving.
3342340	3348000	Microsoft has 57.6 million shipped units worldwide.
3348000	3350740	So they're getting really neck and neck.
3350740	3355120	Sony could overtake this number two position depending on how the holidays and next year
3355120	3356920	goes.
3356920	3360880	Keep in mind we don't know if these companies are talking about what's called sell through
3360880	3362800	or sell in.
3362800	3365600	Sell through means all the way to the consumer at home.
3365600	3368440	Sell in means just on the retail shelves.
3368440	3374360	Either way though just I mean this news isn't that surprising just kind of looking out there
3374360	3376560	on the internet at the chat that's going on.
3376560	3382140	I see a lot more people seem to be picking up PS3s and not surprisingly a lot of it is
3382140	3384680	the same thing that drove the PS2 sales.
3384680	3386180	It's Blu-ray.
3386180	3390840	Back when it was PS2 it was the DVD except the problem was Blu-ray wasn't as widely adopted
3390840	3394760	when PlayStation 3 first came out as it is now and I think you get a lot of people that
3394760	3397880	are buying PlayStation 3s because they're relatively cheap Blu-ray players.
3397880	3399800	Not just that they're 3D Blu-ray players.
3399800	3400800	Yeah.
3400800	3404720	So people that are getting these 3D TVs are buying PlayStation 3s because like hey I can
3404720	3407640	play 3D movies and I can play Arkham City.
3407640	3408640	You know?
3408640	3411440	Honestly the games are getting better on the system.
3411440	3415240	They didn't have much for a while and now they're really getting the good ones.
3415240	3418840	Everybody in the gaming world gave PlayStation 3 shit when it came out.
3418840	3421760	Everybody except the very hardcore Sony fans.
3421760	3427280	It took them a long time but now they've made steady progress to try and get better.
3427280	3433800	I still don't think everything is all roses and sunshine like PlayStation Move.
3433800	3439100	Are they still trying with PlayStation Move Loki or did they finally just kind of shuffle
3439100	3440100	it to the back?
3440100	3441100	No they're definitely still trying.
3441100	3442100	Are they?
3442100	3448800	They've got a bunch of new games coming out and new bundles to try to drive PlayStation
3448800	3449800	Move stuff.
3449800	3456980	I mean looking at just the month of November you've got the GoldenEye 00 edition that comes
3456980	3460560	with the Move and all the Sharpshooter stuff.
3460560	3462040	Which that came out last week.
3462040	3466760	And then in a few weeks you've got LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition which is getting you know
3466760	3468400	Move support as well.
3468400	3472880	And then also they've added like a bundle that they're going to do with the Move stuff
3472880	3475820	with LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition.
3475820	3483840	There's also a bundle with sports champions at medieval moves deadman's quest.
3483840	3487080	And then that game is also coming out by itself from Sony Plus.
3487080	3490080	I petting friends.
3490080	3493320	That is coming out as well if anyone gives a shit.
3493320	3494320	And then.
3494320	3495320	And kids.
3495320	3500960	You know and they've got some new bundles and hardware stuff.
3500960	3502920	Maybe I'm just kind of like poo pooing the Move.
3502920	3505360	There's a lot of games that support it.
3505360	3507600	Everything I see is about Kinect.
3507600	3511900	And even then like this year I don't think Kinect is going to have the same impact this
3511900	3512900	year.
3512900	3517640	But honestly if I had a choice between playing a Kinect game and a Move game of the same
3517640	3518640	game.
3518640	3525020	I'd rather play the Move game and just it seems to be more accurate to me.
3525020	3530920	I really kind of want to play Child of Eden on the PS3 because I think that'd be awesome.
3530920	3532840	Because the Move stuff it seemed to work really well.
3532840	3534440	Kinect sometimes is just kind of eh.
3534440	3536240	But you know the dancing games are pretty awesome.
3536240	3538960	I mean I just can't really see myself playing.
3538960	3540160	It's becoming a one trick pony.
3540160	3542300	It's nothing but the dancing games that are remarkable.
3542300	3543300	You know.
3543300	3544300	Yeah.
3544300	3545300	Kinda.
3545300	3546300	Kinda.
3546300	3549040	And a lot of the games unfortunately I think for not so much with the Move because a lot
3549040	3552320	of people are developing stuff for the Move kind of do stuff with the Wii and they've
3552320	3556400	kind of gotten over that phase of hey look we make it you know where you can waggle to
3556400	3558300	do different things instead of pushing a button.
3558300	3561600	But how is the Kinect evolved a year later.
3561600	3564640	Like what are we seeing on the Kinect now that we didn't see a year ago.
3564640	3565640	Well.
3565640	3566640	Child of Eden.
3566640	3567920	And sequel saw the shit from last year.
3567920	3571320	I wouldn't even call Child of Eden that new because it's just an on rail shooter basically.
3571320	3572320	Yeah but it was.
3572320	3573320	There's plenty of those.
3573320	3575840	It was a type of game we didn't have last year.
3575840	3579840	But like has Kinect really changed gaming.
3579840	3584960	No and even the stuff that Microsoft is touting is kind of like oh look see we're gonna integrate
3584960	3589880	Kinect into these games and it's gonna be really unique and you know the head tracking
3589880	3590880	and stuff like that.
3590880	3592720	Okay the head tracking in Forza 4 is kinda neat.
3592720	3595720	I don't know if it works really well but it's a neat idea.
3595720	3600840	What they used it for Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition is stupid.
3600840	3605040	Oh look at me I can actually use the voice command to switch between old graphics and
3605040	3606040	new graphics.
3606040	3607040	Who gives a fuck.
3607040	3608040	I mean that is stupid.
3608040	3609960	Why would I need to do that on the fly.
3609960	3613760	Or why would I need to yell grenade when I can push a button and it does grenade.
3613760	3616260	I mean it's dumb.
3616260	3621640	So you know if they had head tracking or something like that for Halo that'd be kinda cool where
3621640	3625760	you'd like you get if you move in your head it moves the camera slightly so that there's
3625760	3627320	a little bit more integration there.
3627320	3628720	I mean that could be really cool.
3628720	3632840	I mean they're just unfortunately the head tracking stuff that they're doing like with
3632840	3636400	a Forza 4 even like looking left and right that doesn't work.
3636400	3640720	I mean if you're moving your head a little bit and it's tracking your head and it changes
3640720	3644680	the camera's perspective based on where your head is that's kinda cool cause that's a little
3644680	3648720	bit of immersion there but I don't know some of the stuff that they're doing right now
3648720	3649720	is kinda useless.
3649720	3651680	But yeah there's tons of dancing games.
3651680	3654320	There's tons of sports games.
3654320	3659600	There's you know just stuff you don't really I don't know dancing and sports games is pretty
3659600	3661440	much it.
3661440	3666040	Well PlayStation 3 is gaining a little ground and I gotta admit like I don't wanna blame
3666040	3671240	the hack for this but I don't know what to put my finger on it with but I gotta say like
3671240	3675880	all these games I've been buying lately if they exist versions on the PlayStation 3 and
3675880	3679120	the 360 I've been getting them on the PS3 now.
3679120	3683520	Like I used to buy the 360 versions because multiplayer was so much better on 360 and
3683520	3687760	I have more people on my friends list over there but I haven't been buying a lot of multiplayer
3687760	3693640	games lately and I don't play that many games online so like Arkham City I have on PS3.
3693640	3695440	Disney Universe I got on PS3.
3695440	3698880	Dance Central well obviously that's only an Xbox game so that's what I'm using my Xbox
3698880	3706520	for right now but I gotta admit I can't put my finger on it but I've just been more drawn
3706520	3709460	to my PS3 lately owning both.
3709460	3718040	So this news doesn't really surprise me it's the better controller I think that weighs
3718040	3721080	a lot more than you think by the way Skyrim pre-ordered on PS3.
3721080	3727200	I do actually have to say that the PS3 controller is actually just slightly a bit more comfortable
3727200	3729120	for my injured hand.
3729120	3735000	I hate that Microsoft does not change that goddamn hideous D-pad outside of special edition
3735000	3736680	bullshit that doesn't count.
3736680	3741960	The D-pads alright and even the special edition stuff didn't really help but eh the controllers
3741960	3742960	are alright.
3742960	3749360	I mean I don't really give a crap about the or I don't really care for the convex trigger
3749360	3754280	buttons that are on the Playstation 3 but who cares you know it doesn't really stop
3754280	3757600	me from playing different games on these consoles.
3757600	3763440	Really I don't play anything on the PS3 real uh you know if I'm gonna buy a game it's because
3763440	3769920	well I don't really play with a lot of people on the PS3 online it's just I just don't do
3769920	3770920	it.
3770920	3775120	It's just too bad because I've got a lot of games that I have on the PS3 that I haven't
3775120	3776120	played yet.
3776120	3780280	Going to Salacious Pop in our chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com Salacious Pop says
3780280	3783960	Kinect has actually turned out to be a great utility for special needs people the deaf
3783960	3787880	mobility issues whatever but as a household hardcore entertainment device I don't think
3787880	3792400	it really succeeded but the technology is really important in my opinion the blind not
3792400	3794960	the deaf he meant to say.
3794960	3800560	I get that and that's great and I do think the Kinect has made a lot of progress for
3800560	3804440	like you know accessibility issues has had a lot of the iOS stuff that's come out lately
3804440	3812200	um like Siri and all that but that's not what Microsoft's selling it as I kind of feel like
3812200	3819280	Microsoft hasn't delivered on what they promised it to us at that's great but just because
3819280	3825160	you know that happens to be a great perk about it doesn't mean that you know Microsoft's
3825160	3831240	really delivered on their promise of changing gaming you know I don't know.
3831240	3834760	All right anyhow I guess we'll move on to some more news Dark Sakura.
3834760	3839480	Well how about something about the 3DS that might be good news?
3839480	3844760	Super Mario 3D Land it's actually already out in Japan I believe and they say that it's
3844760	3851280	got new firmware for the system and it's basically supposed to make your friend list more functional
3851280	3857480	so you can join in a friend's game that's already in progress just with pressing a button
3857480	3867280	and it's actually just a brand new firmware as opposed to the scheduled one I think.
3867280	3871800	So now the 3DS is caught up to only being about six years behind in online gaming technology
3871800	3872800	with this new firmware.
3872800	3873800	Something like that.
3873800	3876320	Well it's good to see them making progress forward.
3876320	3881560	Yeah a little progress but they're not sure if it's gonna be out for the US one but they're
3881560	3884640	still waiting on hearing from Nintendo.
3884640	3885640	All right.
3885640	3886640	I would think it would be.
3886640	3892640	It is gonna be on the US one thanks to reviewers of the US copy already and not only does it
3892640	3897640	do all that fancy stuff it of course stops.
3897640	3898640	Well of course.
3898640	3899640	Piracy.
3899640	3903280	You betcha that Skyward Sword on the Wii when is that out by the way is that out today or
3903280	3904280	is that next week?
3904280	3905280	No.
3905280	3906280	That's awhile.
3906280	3907280	Is it?
3907280	3908280	I thought it was like soon.
3908280	3909280	A few more weeks.
3909280	3910280	Actually I think it's Sunday.
3910280	3911280	Two weeks from today.
3911280	3914600	It's only like three weeks until Thanksgiving so it's gotta be the 20th.
3914600	3919840	You know Skyward Sword is gonna patch up how we all hacked our Wii's to play Xenoblade.
3919840	3920840	No.
3920840	3921840	You don't think so?
3921840	3922840	No.
3922840	3923840	Really?
3923840	3924840	Yeah.
3924840	3925840	Why is that?
3925840	3929800	Because those patches don't mean crap.
3929800	3932600	The way they're getting in is not something you can patch out?
3932600	3933600	No.
3933600	3936240	You can take the patches off of those disks.
3936240	3938140	Oh I see what you mean.
3938140	3939720	So in other words.
3939720	3946120	But if somebody who buys it and just installs it as it is might get their stuff overwritten.
3946120	3950400	Well yeah I mean if you connect to even a system update stuff you're gonna get those
3950400	3954080	but I don't think any of that's gonna really matter.
3954080	3961360	Usually they could I guess do that but I don't think that they're going to.
3961360	3966200	In fact I'm just kind of curious here.
3966200	3967200	Just to see.
3967200	3969840	I'm wondering if Skyward Sword's already leaked out because.
3969840	3975840	Well on top of that even if it's not like people aren't going to find another way.
3975840	3978800	So I don't think it's leaked.
3978800	3981480	It's just one of those things I think is interesting that's all.
3981480	3982480	Yeah I mean they could.
3982480	3983840	I mean that'd be a good game for them to do it on.
3983840	3986320	I just to be honest though.
3986320	3987320	The PSP did that a lot.
3987320	3990200	To be honest with you Rob I don't think they give a shit anymore.
3990200	3992960	I just think I don't think they I don't think they care.
3992960	3996440	I think at this point they're like okay well we've done well I don't know we got a story
3996440	3997440	coming up I don't know.
3997440	3998440	I don't know Loki we'll see.
3998440	4000200	I think they're already moved on to the Wii U.
4000200	4001720	We'll talk more about it when we get there.
4001720	4005520	I think you're wrong but we'll we'll I and I was surprised to hear it too but let's let's
4005520	4007760	move on with the release dates.
4007760	4011600	We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out to a store near
4011600	4015560	you and as it is early November there's going to be a lot right Loki.
4015560	4016560	Of course.
4016560	4022840	And as I was telling you before how Activision gets behind really stupid toys toy things
4022840	4023880	for the DS.
4023880	4025940	We have two of them actually coming out today.
4025940	4030720	Moshi Monsters Moshelin Zoo on Nintendo DS and Lala Loopsie.
4030720	4031720	What?
4031720	4033200	Yes I don't understand what they are but hey.
4033200	4036760	Wasn't Lala Loopsie one of the Tinky Winky or one of the Teletubbies?
4036760	4038680	No it's not Teletubby.
4038680	4039680	Lala was a Teletubby.
4039680	4040680	Why do I know that?
4040680	4041680	Why do you know that?
4041680	4042680	I don't know why I know that.
4042680	4050640	This is my head full of random trivia but yeah so that is some weird toy that's popular
4050640	4051640	nowadays.
4051640	4052640	Some loop doll things.
4052640	4053640	I don't know.
4053640	4054640	Whatever.
4054640	4058600	Anyways let's cheer for Xbox 360 and Kinect.

4074300	4077720	This game is like one of the only games this company is making.
4077720	4080100	It's been delayed for four years.
4080100	4081100	Four years.
4081100	4085600	And literally up till the last minute it keeps getting delayed.

4088000	4089000	The hell's the problem?
4089000	4091160	It's just a stupid card game.
4091160	4094480	I don't understand how you develop a card game for four years.
4094480	4095480	It's one guy.
4095480	4097120	And it's a port of a Game Boy Advance game which is hilarious.

4479880	4484720	And it is, the box is about as fucking pink as a box can get.
4484720	4488960	But my favorite thing about this box is that you have all these cuddly, wuddy little characters,
4488960	4489960	right?
4489960	4490960	But then look at this.
4490960	4494160	That's an angry fucking cheetah over there on the left.
4494160	4497480	Like, why are all these bitches crowding in my space?
4497480	4498760	That would devilize, man.
4498760	4501520	They got the creepy red eyes there.
4501520	4505320	This cheetah wants nothing to do with the rest of this cute fuckery that's going on
4505320	4508160	in the rest of the picture.
4508160	4511000	Can you put that on the Tumblr if I link you to that?
4511000	4512280	Yeah.
4512280	4514760	Orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com.
4514760	4519880	Well, if you don't want to, DarkSaucer, I don't know if you should do it.
4519880	4520880	Do it!
4520880	4524040	Put that on the Tumblr so listeners can see that.
4524040	4526080	I love angry cheetah.
4526080	4529360	Da Yeah!
4529360	4530360	But cheetah's saying...
4530360	4531840	The damn thing will ever pull up.
4531840	4533480	Cheetah's saying Da No.
4533480	4537800	Alright, on the Sony PSP, oh no, I already read PSP, derp derp.
4537800	4539880	That's it this week for releases then.
4539880	4542960	That's really it.
4542960	4546200	The Vita to look forward to on December 17th, though, in Japan, remember, they're getting
4546200	4547200	it this year.
4547200	4551480	Before you get to Tumblr, how about the UK release date, StarSakura?
4551480	4554640	Well, give me a second.
4554640	4563120	Okay, on the 8th, we have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, blah.

4593240	4596000	Now I'm gonna post stuff on angry cheetah.
4596000	4597000	Angry cheetah?
4597000	4598000	Yeah.
4598000	4599000	Alright.
4599000	4600000	I'm just saying.
4600000	4601000	Alright.
4601000	4602000	Moving on.
4602000	4605160	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic game of
4605160	4606160	the week.
4606160	4608440	And again, I'll say this about the classic game of the week, it was one of those things
4608440	4612320	where when I saw what it was, because, you know, I co-host the show, I get to see what
4612320	4614760	it is before we start, I went, really?
4614760	4616360	We've never done that one before?
4616360	4620280	And sure enough, it's one of those games, like, this is a true fucking classic and it's
4620280	4622160	not on the list of games we've done before.
4622160	4623160	Go fig.
4623160	4625240	But, a couple more news stories first.
4625240	4626240	Loki?
4626240	4627240	Uh, yes.
4627240	4631960	So Nintendo, of course, they have a lot of patents for weird shit for the Wii and other
4631960	4633080	systems.
4633080	4640160	This one is a device that's basically a touchpad attachment and looks as stupid as it pretty
4640160	4642160	much could get.
4642160	4648080	It's basically this thing that looks like a periscope, and it would attach to the bottom
4648080	4656400	of, or actually it looks like the top of the Wii remote, somehow, and you would, I guess,
4656400	4664240	interact with the Wiimote's IR sensor using, it would detect where your fingers are using
4664240	4670960	this like mirror thing, almost like using the infrared camera that's in the remote as
4670960	4675360	like some sort of camera for your finger positions.
4675360	4678600	So think of it like, you know, instead of looking at the infrared lights that are on
4678600	4682100	the little sensor bar, it looks at your fingers.
4682100	4689160	But it looks so stupid, like so, so very stupid, but neat, I guess?
4689160	4692520	I don't really know what this would be used for.
4692520	4697560	They're saying that it describes like a mouse pointer or something like that, but man, it
4697560	4698560	looks so stupid!
4698560	4699560	I mean, seriously.
4699560	4702880	Well, but this, this, not ergonomically friendly at all.
4702880	4707800	This means that something's in the works for Nintendo that isn't Wii U, or is it?
4707800	4711480	I, well this, I guess, because the Wii U's gonna be the same controller, so maybe it
4711480	4712480	is, who knows?
4712480	4716520	It could be, but it looks like it folds down too, like so you don't have to use it all
4716520	4722360	the time, but man, you know, that's kind of neat that you can use it as like a touchpad,
4722360	4726680	but at the same time, I mean, the Wii remote navigates those menus just fine.
4726680	4731000	I don't think we really need to add more to it.
4731000	4732360	No.
4732360	4738980	Alright, well, also speaking of the Wii, and this is what I was referring to earlier, Loki,
4738980	4744000	when I said, I don't know, they're swearing that there's more coming for the Wii.
4744000	4748820	Reggie Fils-Aime was actually on record this week saying that Zelda Skyward Sword is not
4748820	4752180	the last great game on the Wii.
4752180	4758160	In an interview with a Brazilian site, which was posted on the internet, he was asked the
4758160	4761600	question, what's next for the Wii after Skyward Sword?
4761600	4763700	And he said, more good games.
4763700	4767200	Many people ask me if Zelda Skyward Sword is the last great game for the Wii, and the
4767200	4768680	answer is no.
4768680	4773360	Let's talk about upcoming games for the Wii in late December or early January, cough cough,
4773360	4776480	after the holiday shopping season.
4776480	4777480	Let's talk about that.
4777480	4780480	This, okay, this could be just fucking fluff.
4780480	4785140	Like it could be like whoopty shit Mario Tennis 27 or something, you know?
4785140	4786140	Like of course.
4786140	4787140	What's he gonna say?
4787140	4792340	Sadly, we don't have any good games coming out, but we do have some great filler.
4792340	4796920	Let's talk about, you know, thank you Reggie, let's talk about what's coming out in December
4796920	4798960	and January, shall we?
4798960	4801720	That's a great discussion topic right there.
4801720	4803240	Let's talk about what's coming out on the Wii.
4803240	4807720	We have The Adventures of Tintin, a tie-in game to an animated movie.
4807720	4808720	No one curr.
4808720	4810720	Hey, the French love Tintin.
4810720	4811720	And then we have...
4811720	4812720	No one curr.
4812720	4817480	Then we have, of course, the game from Nintendo themselves, Fortune Street, basically like
4817480	4822540	Mario Party, but with the Dragon Quest characters and the Mario characters in there.
4822540	4825560	Not really a game that people would even be looking for.
4825560	4829560	So in January, as far as I'm aware, eh, nothing.
4829560	4836580	So I mean, I'm sure there's some games coming out or something, but not anything notable.
4836580	4837580	For the Wii.
4837580	4838960	3DS maybe, but the Wii, no.
4838960	4839960	No, not even the 3DS.
4839960	4840960	I don't think...
4840960	4846060	Well, Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS, and then I also think that they have a version of Adventures
4846060	4847060	of Tintin.
4847060	4852240	Actually, if you give me a couple seconds here, I can tell you exactly what's coming
4852240	4853240	out.
4853240	4855720	1,000 to 1,000.
4855720	4857800	Literally a second there.
4857800	4863440	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I haven't bought a game on the Wii in four years.
4863440	4865760	ActDeaf says, I care about Tintin.
4865760	4867520	Yay for you.
4867520	4870040	This is me giving a fuck for you right now.
4870040	4873280	Tintin is awesome.
4873280	4878160	TechNist in our chatroom says, it's not the last, it's the only great game.
4878160	4879160	Just saying.
4879160	4881160	Yeah, I mean, it's...
4881160	4883560	Thank you, SSJ100Matt.
4883560	4887160	I'm throwing shade at Tintin, it has nothing to do with the movie.
4887160	4890200	It's just, you know the game is not going to be anything to scream about.
4890200	4891200	Let's be real.
4891200	4894400	How often are movie games that good, right?
4894400	4895400	Thank you.
4895400	4896400	They're not very good.
4896400	4897400	Okay.
4897400	4901160	Now, Alpha Kinetogram brings up a good point.
4901160	4905680	You're throwing shade at all this December and January stuff, but he said, let's meet
4905680	4908760	up in December or January and then we'll talk.
4908760	4915240	Meaning that maybe they're announcing more plans in December for what's coming in January,
4915240	4921600	which a lot of people are taking to mean, OMG, it's Last Story and Xenoblade and Pandora's
4921600	4928680	Tower, which you said on this show like four months ago is what would happen.
4928680	4931920	That despite the fact that they're saying, no, the games aren't coming now, they're going
4931920	4934360	to come out and be America's fucking savior.
4934360	4941800	Well, I thought they were going to do that at, you know, at like E3 or something.
4941800	4946200	Oh, I'm sorry, 3DS also had Dr. Lorak in the Forgotten Knights.
4946200	4948520	There's a Dr. Lorak game coming on 3DS?
4948520	4949520	Dr. Lorak.
4949520	4950520	Oh, Dr. Lorak.
4950520	4954440	Dr. Lorak and the complete knockoff of Professor Layton.
4954440	4958600	Oh, and National Geographic Challenge, my mistake.
4958600	4959600	The Wii is saved.
4959600	4962040	The Wii is saved.
4962040	4967400	Speaking of release dates, Nintendo is on record that they are purposely holding back
4967400	4969840	some of their upcoming 3DS games.
4969840	4973940	They're going to be releasing them in 2012 because it will maximize sales.
4973940	4975920	This actually makes sense though, to be honest.
4975920	4979620	Like you don't want to release everything right now because then the games are all diluted
4979620	4980620	or whatever.
4980620	4981620	Oh, that's awesome.
4981620	4985280	I can't wait for what other Nintendo 64 game they're going to fucking port over to the
4985280	4986280	3DS.
4986280	4991240	Well now hold on, hold on, because we know there's Luigi's Mansion 2, we know there's
4991240	4993280	the Kid Icarus game that they showed off.
4993280	4994700	Yes, Kid Icarus is coming.
4994700	4998360	And then wasn't there another big one that they had announced that got pushed back?
4998360	5001120	Who gives a crap about Luigi's Mansion?
5001120	5002640	The first one was kind of, ew.
5002640	5005320	I don't know, kind of looks cool, I don't know.
5005320	5006320	I won't spend $30 on it.
5006320	5010000	The only cool part was when you ran into the shadow that looked like it was hanging Luigi.
5010000	5014760	Well maybe they've incorporated elements of Silent Hill and Luigi will be horribly murdered
5014760	5016620	by some of the ghosts.
5016620	5017620	Somebody can dream anyway.
5017620	5018920	I'd pay for that.
5018920	5020320	Let me read you the quote here.
5020320	5021920	You want to hear something funny?
5021920	5027680	There is absolutely no Wii games announced for January at this point.
5027680	5031320	Alright, let me see here.
5031320	5035480	For us to provide software titles one after another, one idea is, isn't it possible for
5035480	5039320	Nintendo to stock some of its software titles instead of launching them as soon as the development
5039320	5040540	is completed?
5040540	5044320	Video games need to stay fresh, so it is not practical for us to put them on hold for too
5044320	5048000	long, but we think that some of them may be held for a certain amount of time so that
5048000	5051960	there will be a short interval between when they are completed and when they are launched.
5051960	5054960	We are taking on this sort of challenge for the Nintendo 3DS.
5054960	5059280	For example, when we look at the software lineup for the year-end sales season, it is
5059280	5063600	so dense that if we added any more software, the total sales would not increase.
5063600	5067840	Accordingly, we have intentionally delayed the launch of some software titles to early
5067840	5068840	next year.
5068840	5072800	Again, I'm not surprised by this.
5072800	5074300	That's the strategy.
5074300	5077800	Most people buy the game the week it comes out or they don't buy it at all or they buy
5077800	5079800	it used.
5079800	5082280	What, Loki?
5082280	5085120	I'm... whatever.
5085120	5089020	I don't see that they're gonna have any big... it's gonna be something retarded.
5089020	5090020	I'm sorry.
5090020	5094200	That they're gonna put out, you know, it's like... it's their next... their last big
5094200	5095200	game.
5095200	5096280	And you know what?
5096280	5100460	It's really not gonna be their last big game because if it's really, really, really good,
5100460	5102180	they're gonna fuckin' port that shit to the Wii U.
5102180	5103180	True.
5103180	5107360	Like they did with Zelda Twilight Princess.
5107360	5112800	So I mean, I don't know, yeah, okay, Nintendo's got a few games coming out, but I don't think
5112800	5118640	it's gonna be anything like, oh my god, this is the greatest game I've ever played.
5118640	5123000	Still though, I gotta say, again, I've played Xenoblade, and it is pretty good, and it is
5123000	5125240	ridiculous that that game is not out in the US.
5125240	5126240	There's no reason it shouldn't be out here.
5126240	5131980	There's a lot of games that they localized for Europe regions that... there was the one
5131980	5138560	it was Disaster Day in Crisis or something like that, that came out over in Japan, and
5138560	5143080	it came out over in Europe, and they completely localized it, and it was Nintendo published,
5143080	5145840	and they just... nah, we're not gonna bring it over here.
5145840	5147920	Let me ask this question.
5147920	5150720	I don't think this is something anyone's talking about, or at least if they are, I haven't
5150720	5152620	read it.
5152620	5155900	With all the talk about Nintendo's losses and so forth, do you think someone's about
5155900	5157840	to get ousted?
5157840	5162120	Do you think that we might see that Iwata gets thrown out, or Reggie Fils-Aime?
5162120	5163120	No?
5163120	5164120	No.
5164120	5165120	You don't think so?
5165120	5170120	Because a lot of this stuff... some bad decisions.
5170120	5173280	Not porting these games I think could be seen as a bad decision.
5173280	5174840	The shareholders?
5174840	5177280	Very pissed off that they won't make iPhone games.
5177280	5180320	But here's the problem though, who gives a fuck what the shareholders want?
5180320	5181320	They're stupid, okay?
5181320	5182320	I mean, no!
5182320	5183320	No, no, no, hold on.
5183320	5184320	Loki!
5184320	5185320	Do you hear what you're saying?
5185320	5190200	I mean, seriously, they sound like stupid fucking fanboys that are like, why aren't
5190200	5193520	you making Mario games for the Xbox 360?
5193520	5195040	I don't like you!
5195040	5202040	I mean, sorry, it's stupid to think that they should make games for their competitor, basically.
5202040	5205720	Yes, let me help my competition.
5205720	5208000	Let's give people more reasons not to buy our systems.
5208000	5210520	We're gonna put our games on other systems.
5210520	5211520	That's stupid.
5211520	5217920	And I'm sorry that... the real answer is, though, if the Wii U sucks, Nintendo's gonna
5217920	5219680	go the way of Sega.
5219680	5221120	They're not gonna go the way of Sega.
5221120	5223760	They're gonna lay low for a while and they're gonna come out with another system.
5223760	5228320	They're gonna go the way they did with, like, the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, where it
5228320	5230280	just didn't do that hot.
5230280	5231640	It'll survive.
5231640	5234560	People will buy it, because people eat up gimmicks.
5234560	5238480	That's why Skylanders is doing alright, because people eat up gimmicks.
5238480	5244640	And by doing well, I mean they've sold 20,000 copies per platform, which is not very well.
5244640	5248200	But I don't know.
5248200	5252040	I think, though, it's stupid if their shareholders want them to make iPhone games.
5252040	5256320	It's not stupid that they shouldn't have, you know, some cheaper priced games on their
5256320	5259380	marketplace to drive sales that way.
5259380	5263360	And yeah, I do think they should get into a market where they have some, you know, 99
5263360	5266120	cent games, because I think that's what people eat up.
5266120	5268960	And they're more likely to purchase that stuff.
5268960	5275940	Yeah the quality might not be as good as your Nintendo games, but I think that they're okay.
5275940	5276940	And you know what?
5276940	5278680	Some people like Angry Birds.
5278680	5282720	Actually, a lot of people like Angry Birds and that kind of stuff, and those are 99 cent
5282720	5283720	games.
5283720	5286800	Or even like Fruit, you know, Fruit Ninja.
5286800	5290180	Simple concept stuff that doesn't take much to develop and you sell it for a cheap price
5290180	5294660	and people get addicted to that shit, and you sell tons of download content.
5294660	5300400	But I think it's stupid for them to be expected to make iOS games.
5300400	5301600	That's just dumb.
5301600	5305000	But yeah, I could see them maybe coming out with some good games.
5305000	5309320	I don't, honestly, the bring over, the last story and stuff like that, even though it's
5309320	5311600	sometimes like, oh man, this is gonna do really well.
5311600	5314240	All these hardcore fans are really into, you know, these games.
5314240	5315480	I think they missed the boat.
5315480	5316480	I don't know.
5316480	5320360	I think that they've seen what, you know, these companies, like Mad World and stuff
5320360	5324040	like that, these games that are appealing to the hardcore crowd, and they just don't
5324040	5329160	make sense for them to bring over, because to publish them, it's just, it's expensive
5329160	5330160	to bring it over here.
5330160	5335660	Now, at the same time, I don't know why they've brought over some of the Dragon Quest games
5335660	5340100	and stuff like that, because I think those are appealing to a hardcore audience, but
5340100	5343940	I don't think they sell that well, I mean, they're not selling millions of copies of
5343940	5344940	these things.
5344940	5348880	All right, well, we're gonna close with this thought here from our chatroom at chat.orangesonstrated.com.
5348880	5352680	Kaijuto says, Nintendo has been in the game too long to fall.
5352680	5354440	They'll be back.
5354440	5355440	We'll see.
5355440	5356440	All right.
5356440	5359680	Ironically enough, we're gonna lead into the classic game of the week, which was picked
5359680	5361160	before tonight's show.
5361160	5362160	Just keep that in mind.
5362160	5370960	A time when gaming life was simpler and, you know, we didn't have all this talk and podcasts
5370960	5375480	that would be cynical about what the shareholders want and all that stuff for these companies.
5375480	5376760	We just play games.
5376760	5380700	When we were still in high school and would hide in our room and play it all day.
5380700	5386400	So Dark Sakura, when you were in high school, what game did you go in and play all day?
5386400	5390600	Super Mario World, which I was so surprised we haven't done before.
5390600	5391600	I could have swore we did.
5391600	5392600	I thought we did too.
5392600	5397280	It did Super Mario World 2, which was Mario's Island, wasn't it?
5397280	5398280	Yes.
5398280	5399880	Which was not nearly as fun as this one.
5399880	5400880	Yoshi's Island.
5400880	5401880	Yoshi's Island.
5401880	5402880	It was all right.
5402880	5404720	It had the stupid crying baby.
5404720	5406720	That was annoying.
5406720	5410640	So yeah, Super Mario World is the game.
5410640	5411640	Yay!
5411640	5415560	And it was subtitled as Super Mario Brothers 4 for the Japanese release.
5415560	5421440	I kind of love this music.
5421440	5431360	This is my favorite music in the game.
5431360	5437500	This game had such great music and it was all done by Koji Kondo too, did you know that?
5437500	5444640	It was, of course, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who is the man.
5444640	5451260	And it's basically Mario and Luigi have to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser.
5451260	5457240	And so they go all the way across these seven worlds to save Dinosaur Land.
5457240	5462560	And it had different power-ups in it, like the cape, and of course you still had the
5462560	5467960	fire flower, and you could ride Yoshi, and Yoshi was awesome.
5467960	5472200	So anyway, it was pretty much, you know, you had your overworld and you could go into the
5472200	5478140	different levels, and you had your super mushroom, which is the other one I forgot to mention.
5478140	5481640	And then Yoshi had all these different powers, like if you got the different colored Yoshis,
5481640	5486640	like the purple Yoshi, if you swallowed a shell, he could just keep flying forever.
5486640	5491760	And then if he was red, then every time he hit a shell, he would burp fire.
5491760	5496800	And then there was the yellow Yoshi, wasn't it, that had the stomp, wasn't the stomp.
5496800	5497800	Can I interrupt for a minute?
5497800	5498800	Go for it.
5498800	5500160	This game is so fucking good.
5500160	5501160	I know.
5501160	5505340	Like, like even just watching this YouTube right now, I'm like, oh my god, like so many
5505340	5509600	years of my childhood playing this game are just like flowing back, like I really want
5509600	5514240	to just stay up all night and play this fucking game, and not go to work tomorrow.
5514240	5515240	Damn responsibility.
5515240	5517000	I was like, I can arrange that.
5517000	5521600	I know, seriously, Jamie, we need to pick a day, we need to figure out a way to stream
5521600	5526200	to the interwebs from your house on the TVs and all that, and just fucking play this,
5526200	5532560	Guardian Legend, all the fucking games we love as kids, and somehow ask people to donate
5532560	5533560	and make it a charity thing.
5533560	5538320	Halfway through this game, you will hear me cuss up a fucking storm because of the dirt
5538320	5546200	level, you know, where it has the, I call it the dirt level, when it has the shifting
5546200	5551560	sand, and you'll either get crushed to death or get caught in a wall or something and get
5551560	5552920	crushed to death again.
5552920	5553920	So yeah.
5553920	5561720	So anyway, basically, you also, you go to Dinosaurland and you're on vacation and Peach
5561720	5569920	gets kidnapped, as usual, and so they find an egg and they meet Yoshi, and they find
5569920	5574560	out that evil turtles have imprisoned everybody.
5574560	5579040	So basically, this, I mean, if you haven't played this game, get out from under the rock
5579040	5583600	you've been, you know, hiding under and go freaking play it, because it's awesome.
5583600	5589880	I love the end of it, and it's mode 7-tastic via the fight with Bowser.
5589880	5593560	And man, there was just so much to do in this game, it was so much fun.
5593560	5598000	I really can't get over, and there were different ways to end each level, like, you could get
5598000	5602680	the key, and you would put the key in the keyhole, and the keyhole would get huge and
5602680	5610800	then eat you, and you could climb up the bean stalks like you could in the original Super
5610800	5618280	Mario Bros. and Mario Bros. 3, and you had the ghost houses that had the boos in them,
5618280	5622280	where if you turned your back to the boo, then the boo will follow you, but if you look
5622280	5624560	at him, he hides his face and he's really cute.
5624560	5627440	I have a Boo Mario keychain, did I tell you that?
5627440	5631560	It was just so much to do, this game is so much fun.
5631560	5636760	So let's go ahead, though, and get to how we've seen this today.
5636760	5643200	And on top of that, I really, I know I've mentioned the music before, but you know,
5643200	5645920	Sony did the music processor for the Super Nintendo, right?
5645920	5650560	Yeah, you know, the Playstation was damn near the CD-ROM for the Super Nintendo.
5650560	5651560	Yeah.
5651560	5658320	I really, I really think that this game makes the best use of the music synthesizer in the
5658320	5659320	system.
5659320	5664920	So, um, yeah, you also had the P blocks that would, you know, change your thing and change
5664920	5668360	the type of ending that you get, all kinds of stuff, it's so much fun.
5668360	5670240	And the Star Road.
5670240	5674560	The Star Road was sparkly and freaking hard, because you had three different ways to beat
5674560	5676040	the Star Road, too, it was crazy.
5676040	5681200	So yeah, so re-releases, there was, um, Super Mario All-Stars came out and it had this packaged
5681200	5687880	with it, which is basically the exact same version as what came on this mess anyway.
5687880	5694560	Um, however, a little bit of difference in it is that Luigi had his own sprite, so that's
5694560	5695560	kind of neat.
5695560	5704880	Um, Super Mario World came out, um, on the Virtual Console as well, and, uh, it also
5704880	5709440	was a demo of the game that was available as one of the masterpieces in Super Smash
5709440	5710440	Bros.
5710440	5711440	Brawl.
5711440	5717240	Um, Super Mario Advance 2 Super Mario World came out and, um, it was just one player only.
5717240	5722000	You could still use Luigi, but it was an alternate of Mario and he could jump higher than Mario
5722000	5723540	but run slower.
5723540	5724540	And they have voices.
5724540	5728280	The interesting thing, too, about Mario World 2 is that even though it was, like, so different
5728280	5733820	and on paper it sounds terrible that they made all these changes, it really stands on
5733820	5738520	its own as another great fucking 2D game.
5738520	5739520	Like it's a-
5739520	5740840	It's the same game, just with a little bit of tweaks.
5740840	5742760	It's an outstanding game.
5742760	5743760	Yeah.
5743760	5748260	Um, and they also changed Luigi's sprites to make it a little bit closer to the Mario
5748260	5749640	Advance style.
5749640	5758320	Um, like I said, Koji Kondo did the, um, music, um, and, uh, he also did all the variations
5758320	5759320	on it.
5759320	5765160	So there was, like, the Waltz version of the music that played slower in the caves, um,
5765160	5767880	the underwater version, all kinds of different ones.
5767880	5774520	And he basically, um, and, uh, when you ride on Yoshi, the soundtrack on the levels have
5774520	5775520	banjo drums.
5775520	5776520	Did you hear that?
5776520	5781320	Yeah, oh yeah, you can hear it in the background right now, actually.
5781320	5786720	Yeah, I always thought that was awesome how, like, the music changed, depending on if you
5786720	5787720	were on Yoshi or not.
5787720	5790160	Can I read a quick comment from our chat room?
5790160	5793200	Uh, it was a Tiger Claw on chat talking about Mode 7.
5793200	5796120	I remember when you fight Bowser at the end, he does that thing where he flies towards
5796120	5797120	the screen.
5797120	5798120	It was really cool back then.
5798120	5799560	So we got an early taste of Mode 7.
5799560	5802400	Oh yeah, that last boss fight was epic.
5802400	5805600	Yeah, but really easy.
5805600	5806600	It was really easy.
5806600	5811920	But, like, you spend the whole game challenge to get there, but sort of the last boss fight
5811920	5812920	is more of a relief.
5812920	5813920	Yeah.
5813920	5817160	I mean, and it's not a short fight.
5817160	5818160	You just have to have good timing.
5818160	5821120	It was in multiple phases, and the part where the little thing he's riding starts bouncing
5821120	5824800	doesn't get kind of hard, but, I mean, yeah, at that point, like, if you're good enough
5824800	5831760	in the game to get to that point, then it's, um, oh, I loved the, um, Scary House music.
5831760	5835760	And I turned it up.
5835760	5838240	And the fence.
5838240	5839720	That was the others.
5839720	5841720	Oh my god, I loved the fence stuff.
5841720	5844000	And, you know, that was in all of the commercials too, remember?
5844000	5846400	This game is so fucking good.
5846400	5851720	And you could punch them in the face through the fence.
5851720	5852720	That was so awesome.
5852720	5854040	I loved punching them in the face.
5854040	5855920	Oh god, I totally forgot about the fence parts.
5855920	5857920	And then, oh, look, the flip around, flip around ones, oh my god.
5857920	5859920	I know, I know, I know.
5859920	5861920	Oh my god, okay.
5861920	5868400	So, how about, um, we get into some of the other little stuff that has to do with this.
5868400	5870720	How about Asshole Mario?
5870720	5871720	You remember Asshole Mario?
5871720	5873280	I remember Asshole Mario.
5873280	5874760	Is there a YouTube I can pull up of that real quick?
5874760	5875760	Uh, I'm sure there is.
5875760	5877080	Yeah, it won't matter, because they won't see.
5877080	5878800	You'll have to Tumblr it or something.
5878800	5882680	Well, look up, though, one of the music Mario World.
5882680	5886800	Because, um, or you can just keep playing, I don't care.
5886800	5887800	Oh, the Thwomps.
5887800	5888800	Those are awesome.
5888800	5897960	Um, okay, so Asshole Mario is basically, um, ROM hacks of, um, Super Mario World, where
5897960	5904520	it's not impossible, but it's freaking terrible, because you have to have perfect timing and
5904520	5912020	be able to, to, uh, cut out a little so short, um, but you really have to be careful and
5912020	5913020	have your timing perfect.
5913020	5916040	And you keep dying over and over and over again, you just have to have a million men
5916040	5917040	to get through it.
5917040	5922240	But, yeah, if you want to see, um, an exercise in futility, look up Asshole Mario.
5922240	5927960	And then, um, there's another one where people would basically have, this thing is like an
5927960	5935320	autoplay, is what it was called, the Mario autoplays, where they actually have, where
5935320	5941420	all you do is you start the level, and Mario will start walking on his own, you basically
5941420	5943480	do it through means of an autoscroll level.
5943480	5945080	Oh, that shit was funny.
5945080	5948800	Yeah, look up, look up, um, autoplay, I think is what it is.
5948800	5957000	But, um, he would, it would play rhythm along with whatever, uh, the music was in the background
5957000	5958000	level.
5958000	5960000	I think this is one, isn't it?
5960000	5962200	This YouTube's called Super Mario Autorun.
5962200	5966400	Uh, it doesn't, it has some weird music in the background, though.
5966400	5968400	Yeah, it's doing it to different music.
5968400	5975400	Can you turn up just a little bit?
5975400	5989600	Put that on the Tumblr, so people can see that.
5989600	5990600	I will.
5990600	5992280	Yeah, that's the first one I ever saw.
5992280	5995300	By the way, that's what we're using Tumblr for now, is that all these little things we
5995300	5999280	see during the show, that way you podcast-y listeners can go back and have it all in one
5999280	6000280	place.
6000280	6006040	Yeah, but basically they'll take music and they'll set the game autoplaying to all of
6006040	6011760	this stuff, and just the amount of time and thought and rhythm that goes into this is
6011760	6013880	just absolutely baffling.
6013880	6015800	These people have no lives, but it's really cool.
6015800	6020080	S.S.J. 100 Matt linked to Asshole Mario in the chat room, so I just want to remember
6020080	6022040	how fucking terrible this is.
6022040	6024840	Um, Asshole Mario.
6024840	6030240	It's like you just start to feel sorry for these people after a while, because it's like,
6030240	6036280	oh my, you could, I swear, there's been times when I've watched those and I just want to
6036280	6040840	go, oh, I'm so sorry, oh, I'm so sorry, and then feel like crying because you can feel
6040840	6042160	like it's happening to you.
6042160	6046000	No, I'm laughing, because this stage just starts out right off the bat, Bullet Bill
6046000	6049160	in your face.
6049160	6051760	If you're not ready for it, it's going to get you.
6051760	6053080	That's awesome.
6053080	6054520	It's crazy.
6054520	6056080	Anything else that you were going to say about this?
6056080	6060320	No, it's just that Super Mario World is awesome, and it's clearly created such a legacy, you
6060320	6061320	know?
6061320	6062320	Oh yeah.
6062320	6066960	So, I'd say it's well worthy of being our Classic Game of the Week.
6066960	6072040	If Mario 3D World is half as good as Super Mario World, it'll be a great purchase.
6072040	6073040	For real.
6073040	6074040	So.
6074040	6078760	Alright, your Classic Game of the Week, Super Mario World, a true, true, true classic.
6078760	6084720	I mean, the classic, and just shocked as hell that that has never come up before, so what
6084720	6085720	a find.
6085720	6089480	Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go
6089480	6090480	anywhere.
6090480	6091480	We're not done yet.
6091480	6092480	There's still half a show to come.
6092480	6094120	We've got plenty of news to talk about still.
6094120	6097960	Your emails are coming up, the FUs of the Week, your Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash
6097960	6103060	O-L-R. Much more news in the second half of the show, including, I find this crazy, which
6103060	6107000	PopCap game might they be making an arcade machine out of?
6107000	6108880	That could be something else, huh?
6108880	6113040	Rapid Fire News and all that fun stuff when we come back after a quick break with more
6113040	6120280	of Orange Launch Radio.
6120280	6122760	Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio.
6122760	6128040	We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 6th of 2011, with the second half of episode
6128040	6135800	number 434 live tonight, as we are every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
6135800	6139680	We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
6139680	6140680	show.
6140680	6141680	We love Bobby.
6141680	6146480	He's one guy doing an NPR-ish style show, where he talks about games and has live call-ins
6146480	6147480	as well and so forth.
6147480	6148480	And one thing he was talking about-
6148480	6149480	Except without being boring.
6149480	6150480	Yeah, he's not boring.
6150480	6151480	Yeah, he's not.
6151480	6152480	Not at all.
6152480	6155440	It's like one of those like really thrilling NPR shows, like Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me
6155440	6156440	or something like that.
6156440	6157440	Does it exist?
6157440	6158440	Yes.
6158440	6159440	Okay.
6159440	6160440	They have some fun podcasts.
6160440	6161440	You should check it out.
6161440	6164280	But anyway, one thing that Bobby was talking about on his show tonight that I guess it's
6164280	6166680	coming up a little later in our show, so I apologize.
6166680	6170320	I'm stepping on it a little bit, but maybe Loki can find another story to fill in for
6170320	6171320	it, because I want to talk about this.
6171320	6173680	And that's the Mass Effect 3 beta that came out.
6173680	6178320	And I guess some things are being reported out of that whole Mass Effect 3 beta, that
6178320	6183160	there's going to be new modes in the game, that there's not just going to be like a normal
6183160	6184160	mode, right?
6184160	6188280	But that there'll be a mode in the game that focuses more on the combat features, and then
6188280	6192820	a mode that focuses more on the RPG and dialogue features.
6192820	6198040	And I got to admit, I'm not usually a Mass Effect fan, but I find that shit really exciting.
6198040	6204360	Like you know, combat's okay, but I'm way more into the story elements and all of that.
6204360	6208880	So if there's like an RPG only mode, like I'm really excited about that.
6208880	6213080	Loki, do you think that's good for the game, for the series or what?
6213080	6214080	Sure.
6214080	6216200	Probably won't pick it up anyways.
6216200	6217680	You get it anyways, just because?
6217680	6218840	No, I will not get it.
6218840	6219840	Oh, you're not going to get it.
6219840	6220840	Why not?
6220840	6221840	You're just not a fan of Mass Effect?
6221840	6225160	I'm not either, but I find that really interesting.
6225160	6230360	I mean, and to be honest, I'm not hating because I think the games are bad, it's just again,
6230360	6234800	there's only so many games that a person can play at a time, and I just never got into
6234800	6237680	Mass Effect 1 or 2 as much as other people love them.
6237680	6241520	I watched somebody play 1 and I was kind of like, it doesn't really look like something
6241520	6242520	I'd be into.
6242520	6246180	And I mean, I don't know, I've enjoyed other Bioware games, I've played like Dragon Age,
6246180	6248180	so who knows?
6248180	6252560	Alright, well let's get into some rapid fire news.
6252560	6256360	We're going to cover some news stories really quickly because there was quite a bit of news
6256360	6257360	this week.
6257360	6258360	It is a busy time of year.
6258360	6260360	Loki, we'll start with you.
6260360	6265760	Capcom believes that Resident Evil Revelations is going to be worth $50, and that's $10 more
6265760	6273280	than your regular 3DS game, in fact even Nintendo games like Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart
6273280	6275100	7 are only going to be $40.
6275100	6283960	But Capcom thinks, hey you know what, Resident Evil Revelations should be $50.
6283960	6288080	And it will support the circle pad, which will be coming out of here later on.
6288080	6290000	For another $20.
6290000	6297200	And they were quick to point out, yes you can reset your save game this time.
6297200	6301680	Oh well thank you Capcom, thank you so much, that was very gracious of you to let us do
6301680	6302680	that.
6302680	6305000	It's amazing why they need the extra $10.
6305000	6310680	A true console experience on a handheld device is what Resident Evil Revelations is.
6310680	6317920	It's also going to be, it requires a 4GB cartridge resulting in a higher price point.
6317920	6322200	Yes because those extra, you know, gigabytes are more expensive.
6322200	6328080	You know, I don't know what cartridges cost, but I know when it comes to flash memory,
6328080	6336960	an extra 4GB on flash memory, 4 versus 8, like a few bucks, a couple dollars.
6336960	6341120	Flash memory is really cheap, Capcom, I'm not buying it.
6341120	6342120	Really I'm not buying it.
6342120	6345680	I'm not going to buy your game at all.
6345680	6348760	So, meh.
6348760	6352720	And of course if you're interested, it comes out in February.
6352720	6357800	Of course there's going to be a new Rainbow Six game coming from Ubisoft I'm sure.
6357800	6364680	Miles is probably a ways away, but Rainbow Six Patriots, outed by the new Game Informer
6364680	6373120	cover, is going to be kind of a game that deals with, you know, terrorism set in our
6373120	6379480	own country, and kind of like home grown terrorists I guess.
6379480	6391560	No real details, but obviously they're saying there's a lot of splits in, a lot of, the
6391560	6398320	word's escaping me now, basically a lot of different narrative directions, they said.
6398320	6405640	Tactics and realism, they kind of go in the whole double, was it the last conviction route
6405640	6411920	I guess, the Splinter Cell game, more realistic and gritty, versus the last Rainbow Six game
6411920	6420160	was Vegas, a little kind of over the top I think, but they still, I don't think it's
6420160	6425080	coming out any time soon, maybe the fall, because we still have Ghost Recon Future Soldier
6425080	6428200	which is supposed to be coming out, and I don't think you'd want to compute two Tom
6428200	6434440	Clancy games, but yeah I can see that coming out maybe, yeah they're saying 2013, so that's
6434440	6439920	still a ways away, but it looks pretty cool, I never really played any of the Rainbow Six
6439920	6444960	games, I did play a lot of Ghost Recon stuff, so it should be interesting to have to check
6444960	6445960	it out I guess.
6445960	6451800	I think Dan played a little bit of that and he liked it, Rainbow Six, the last one.
6451800	6456080	And not surprisingly, with all the Kinect hacks out there, Microsoft is actually thinking
6456080	6462680	about marketing Kinect for PC, and Kinect for Windows is going to be the new marketing
6462680	6468760	campaign I guess, they're actually going to be doing, it's an official website, where
6468760	6474840	developers can download newly released beta 2 software development kits, and allow people
6474840	6481880	to make different software and apps that will use the Kinect camera, and you know it might
6481880	6485320	be interesting, maybe someday, and I'm not sure if this is going to be something that's
6485320	6491040	in Windows 8, but maybe they're going to have a lot more integration with PCs with the Kinect,
6491040	6495360	maybe even so far as building in a Kinect camera into a laptop or something like that.
6495360	6500080	I could see that happening actually, I don't know why, but the Kinect at close range, that's
6500080	6504120	the only thing, who plays the PC from far away?
6504120	6509440	I understand that, but maybe they could adapt the Kinect camera to have it like, okay, there's
6509440	6514340	going to be one that's like, I'm sitting in front of my laptop, versus I'm sitting 8 feet
6514340	6515340	away from my laptop.
6515340	6516340	Yeah, true.
6516340	6521200	And for some of the accessibility reasons that SalaciousPop had brought up in a chat
6521200	6525660	comment earlier, I could see where Kinect getting built into the PCs would be more useful
6525660	6530480	than like, what we think of in our minds right now when we think of Kinect, like Dance Central.
6530480	6531480	You know?
6531480	6532480	Yeah.
6532480	6533480	Yeah.
6533480	6534480	So.
6534480	6535480	It'd be neat.
6535480	6537800	Especially some of the voice commands and things like that, especially with some of
6537800	6543040	the early stuff of Windows 8, where you see that it's going to have a mode that's very
6543040	6546480	dashboard-like or tablet-like, I'm sure you've all seen that.
6546480	6547480	Yeah.
6547480	6549120	Gonna be interesting.
6549120	6550560	So the Kinect could control that.
6550560	6554800	Well, I can see, yeah, definitely, because the Kinect controls that already in the new
6554800	6558720	dashboard, so they could just adapt it exactly the same way.
6558720	6560720	True.
6560720	6566620	Moving on to some other stories here, Techland has trademarked Dead World.
6566620	6567620	Why is this important?
6567620	6569780	Because they're the folks that made Dead Island.
6569780	6574760	So immediately we're all thinking, hmm, maybe there will be a sequel to the game that just
6574760	6577440	came out recently that did pretty well.
6577440	6581080	Did pretty well, came out at a good time, and a lot of people were into this, so going
6581080	6584400	from island to the whole damn world makes a lot of sense.
6584400	6588600	So we'll see more on that, probably at E3 next year, if it ends up that it's legit.
6588600	6591000	Or maybe they're just trademarking it, just in case.
6591000	6593800	You never know, but usually these things end up being the game.
6593800	6597120	Yeah, I would imagine that they're making a sequel to a popular game.
6597120	6600840	Walmart's getting its own game magazine, which, you know, game magazines do pretty well for
6600840	6603640	stores if GameStop is any indication.
6603640	6609440	But what's interesting is that the folks behind it is going to be EGM Media, of course, Electronic
6609440	6610880	Gaming Monthly.
6610880	6613600	The new magazine will be called Walmart Game Center.
6613600	6617920	They're not saying it's going to be monthly, they just say, quote, regular frequency.
6617920	6622920	So maybe that's just, you know, monthly during the busy periods and twice, you know, every
6622920	6626480	other month or whatever during the not so busy periods, who knows.
6626480	6630840	It's going to have news, previews, interviews, and other exclusive stories on gaming culture
6630840	6632320	and the most important game releases.
6632320	6635800	In other words, pretty much the same shit you can get on the internet right away.
6635800	6638080	So it's making it very difficult for magazines right now.
6638080	6645820	But if they can get the good exclusives and takes on gaming culture, certainly it could
6645820	6647600	give GameStop some competition.
6647600	6653320	And although I'm not a big Walmart fan either, I'm all for giving GameStop a little competition.
6653320	6658320	They are going to offer this on personal computers, iPad, and Facebook with what's called the
6658320	6660720	Screen Paper Publishing Platform.
6660720	6663200	I guess that's a proprietary thing to EGM.
6663200	6669800	Very interesting to me that it's not on the iPod or iOS, iPad magazine thing they have
6669800	6671880	now because you can get Retro Gamer now on your iPhone.
6671880	6672880	Did you know that?
6672880	6675040	It's all part of that newsstand thing that came out in the new iOS.
6675040	6680140	Granted, you have to pay five bucks an issue or whatever it costs normally on the newsstand.
6680140	6684680	But it is, you know, they got to adapt and get with the times and a lot of people are
6684680	6686240	doing reading on their iPods and iPads.
6686240	6689280	They're going to adapt and get with the times, maybe lower that price point.
6689280	6691280	Yeah, that would probably be a good idea too.
6691280	6695800	But you know, I guess maybe Dark Sacred could tell you it takes a lot of work to put those
6695800	6697040	magazines together.
6697040	6699860	I could totally tell you that.
6699860	6701440	Now I think this is funny.
6701440	6704200	This is a very tongue-in-cheek, very sort of game.
6704200	6711520	It's an indie game that just came out on Xbox Live Indie Games and the indie game developer
6711520	6714320	is Ben Kane.
6714320	6718520	It's called DLC Quest and I love this trailer so I'm going to play a little bit for you
6718520	6719520	guys.
6719520	6721420	Maybe we'll get it on the Tumblr too.
6721420	6724920	Going Loud Studios put this out and here's the trailer.
6724920	6731000	What happens when DLC goes too far?
6731000	6733000	DLC Quest.
6733000	6736200	The basic features are now DLC.
6736200	6738200	Pausing the game?
6738200	6740200	DLC Quest.
6740200	6741200	Animation?
6741200	6742200	DLC Quest.
6742200	6744200	Moving to the left.
6744200	6746200	Well, that's included.
6746200	6748200	No, it's not.
6748200	6750200	DLC Quest.
6750200	6754440	Collect coins and buy DLC.
6754440	6755440	It's simple.
6755440	6760400	DLC means downloadable content and Quest means Quest.
6760400	6762400	DLC Quest.
6762400	6770400	We got map packs, night map packs, sexy outfits, hats, and zombies.
6770400	6773400	Yeah, we even got horse armor.
6773400	6775400	DLC Quest.
6775400	6778400	I think there's a princess or something to rescue too.
6778400	6780400	I don't know.
6780400	6781400	**** you.
6781400	6784400	DLC Quest is made with satire.
6784400	6789400	Satire means the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ritual to expose and criticize people's
6789400	6790400	stupidity.
6790400	6791400	DLC Quest.
6791400	6792400	Download it now.
6792400	6797400	See, now, I thought that was funny.
6797400	6798400	That was funny.
6798400	6799400	Here's the thing.
6799400	6803400	The satire part is, and what you can't see unless you're actually looking at the video,
6803400	6807400	is that the guy is walking around collecting coins in a very Mario-esque kind of game,
6807400	6811900	so the quote-unquote DLC is that you're using these coins you pick up to get the ability
6811900	6816400	to move to the left and get sexy princess outfits and horse armor and all this stuff.
6816400	6818400	I think that's funny and it is pretty good satire.
6818400	6820400	What did you think of that, Loki?
6820400	6821400	I don't know if you've seen that before.
6821400	6822400	What?
6822400	6823400	It's pretty funny.
6823400	6824400	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
6824400	6825400	So, I don't know how much that costs.
6825400	6826400	I didn't see...
6826400	6827400	Oh!
6827400	6828400	80 Microsoft points.
6828400	6829400	A buck.
6829400	6830400	Good for you, dude.
6830400	6831400	A whole dollar.
6831400	6833400	I think you'll sell some copies with that.
6833400	6834400	Why not?
6834400	6835400	Why not?
6835400	6836400	Good for you, dude.
6836400	6837400	All right.
6837400	6839400	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6839400	6840400	A couple things.
6840400	6845400	Actually, new Xbox Live Arcade game is Alan Wake.
6845400	6851400	It's going to be available for Xbox Live Arcade and it was announced on their Facebook page.
6851400	6852400	It's not a sequel.
6852400	6854400	It is the game.
6854400	6861400	Also, there is a country music pack for Rock Band 3 that's got a lot of crap in it.
6861400	6864400	And I mean crap because I hate country music.
6864400	6867400	It's called Going Country Pack 5.
6867400	6868400	It's Shelly Wright.
6868400	6871400	Yeah, but couldn't you call stuff like Sweet Home Alabama country music?
6871400	6872400	No, Southern Rock.
6872400	6873400	There's a difference.
6873400	6875400	Sorry, my bad.
6875400	6877400	There's some decent stuff in here.
6877400	6881400	The night the lights went out of Georgia is Reba.
6881400	6882400	There's Sugarland.
6882400	6885400	There's also Going Country Pack 6.
6885400	6888400	That's Billy Currington, whoever the crap that is.
6888400	6889400	George Strait.
6889400	6894400	I mean, hey, Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire, Justin Moore, who cares?
6894400	6895400	Going Country Pack 7.
6895400	6896400	Dude, Johnny Cash.
6896400	6897400	Keith Urban.
6897400	6899400	Hey, Lady Antebellum.
6899400	6900400	Merle Haggard.
6900400	6902400	Now, Merle Haggard's pretty awesome.
6902400	6906400	And Going Country Pack 8 has Dwight Yoakam and Rascal Flatts.
6906400	6910400	Going Country Mega Pack, all of the above, and all the other stuff I didn't say, and
6910400	6911400	it's 20 bucks.
6911400	6916400	It almost makes you think that at some point they were gonna do a country rock band release
6916400	6918400	and didn't end up doing it because they had like all these songs.
6918400	6919400	This is a lot from getting it once.
6919400	6921400	They did two country rock band track packs.
6921400	6923400	Yeah, they did the track packs a while ago.
6923400	6925400	I guess maybe this is just a virtual version of that.
6925400	6926400	I don't know.
6926400	6929400	The only one of those that I care about is Johnny Cash because Ring of Fire is awesome.
6929400	6933400	Yeah, Johnny Cash, he's above country music.
6933400	6936400	He's godly music.
6936400	6938400	And then, you know, Ring of Fire was in the Silent Hill movie.
6938400	6941400	Yeah, but still, Ring of Fire is just a great song.
6941400	6943400	I'm giving it another...
6943400	6945400	I see, a little video game connection.
6945400	6946400	I'm wearing my Silent Hill shirt.
6946400	6947400	You are.
6947400	6948400	You are.
6948400	6950400	Pyramid Head is attacking your boobies on that shirt.
6950400	6953400	I've enjoyed it all day.
6953400	6963400	And speaking of Silent Hill, there actually is talk that Silent Hill may be going off into different spin-offs.
6963400	6974400	I haven't really said exactly what, but there's been mentions of maybe an RPG or a first-person shooter.
6974400	6977400	They did have that arcade game that was kind of a shooter, wasn't it?
6977400	6979400	Yeah, and it was the iPhone game.
6979400	6982400	I wish the iPhone game was pretty awful, but it was an early game.
6982400	6986400	I wish they would port that arcade game to, like, Xbox Live Arcade or something.
6986400	6992400	They also said that Downpour, though, was never going to be a first-person shooter.
6992400	7001400	The quote is, and this is coming from, let's see, Tom Hewlett, who's a senior associate producer on Silent Hill, Downpour.
7001400	7003400	It says, Downpour was never going to be an FPS.
7003400	7008400	This is just the result of some overzealous fans reading too much into a posting on Vatra's website.
7008400	7011400	How about make Silent Hill cool again?
7011400	7016400	Seriously. For Sakuriyamoka to come back. Throw a lot, a lot, a lot of money at him.
7016400	7018400	That's what you could do.
7018400	7020400	And grovel. Groveling helps.
7020400	7022400	Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangehunter.com.
7022400	7026400	A lot on the country pack, the dark soccer I mentioned a minute ago.
7026400	7030400	Brad from Pod Culture says, when is this country pack due out, or did I miss it?
7030400	7032400	Did you save the date?
7032400	7034400	No, I didn't.
7034400	7036400	It's this upcoming week, right?
7036400	7037400	Yeah, I think so.
7037400	7041400	So, that'll be out very, very soon. It's not like something like Way in the Future.
7041400	7044400	It is, I just pulled it up. November 8th is when this is all out.
7044400	7049400	Going to other comments, Legend of Zaku says, needs more achy breaky heart.
7049400	7051400	Please no.
7051400	7053400	Unless we have the Weird Al version. We need a Weird Al pack.
7053400	7055400	That would be awesome, actually.
7055400	7058400	He's gonna be in Oakland in a couple days, or maybe it was tonight.
7058400	7060400	Ugh, damn.
7060400	7062400	If there's no writing going on or all that.
7062400	7069400	Let's see, Tigerclaw says, going country? Will there be other genres, like going dance, going rave?
7069400	7075400	Well, as neat as that idea is, keep in mind, it is gonna have to make use of all the instruments somehow.
7075400	7084400	Now, there are some songs that will exclude a keyboard or a bass, but keep in mind, it's gonna be really hard to do a dance pack.
7084400	7086400	Unless it has guitars.
7086400	7092400	But like, they could do like CNC Music Factory, Everybody Dance Now, because it had that...
7092400	7096400	I guess they could probably get creative and figure something out. We'll see.
7096400	7107400	Alright, let's move on to some more news before we get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week, and your calls pretty soon here.
7107400	7108400	Loki.
7108400	7118400	Yes. Now, one of the features of the Playstation 3 has been to allow people the ability to share content.
7118400	7124400	Or at least you can link your content that you download to up to five different PS3s.
7124400	7128400	I would imagine that's if, for example, you own multiple PS3s.
7128400	7136400	Or, for example, if you have a PS3 that dies and you wanna bring that content to the new PS3.
7136400	7138400	And they figure that you're not probably gonna go through five PS3s.
7138400	7141400	Well, people have been using that to share games.
7141400	7145400	So say, for example, I download a game and I can share it with four of my friends.
7145400	7150400	Because they all download it to their console using that sharing feature.
7150400	7154400	Kind of exploiting it, if you will.
7154400	7162400	Well, beginning on November 18th, Playstation Network licenses can only be tied to two PS3s and two PSPs.
7162400	7168400	Apparently, they're saying that that's gonna affect purchases made after the start date.
7168400	7178400	And while you'll be able to deactivate and reactivate consoles online, the days of sharing with a bunch of people is now gone.
7178400	7182400	And so, honestly, I think that's fair.
7182400	7186400	I mean, because people were kind of abusing it to begin with to get free games.
7186400	7195400	And if you can deactivate consoles, like say, for example, your console dies or whatever, and you can reactivate it on a new console, I think that's fair enough.
7195400	7199400	So, yeah. Go Sony.
7199400	7202400	I'm kinda not surprised. They're clamping down on it.
7202400	7210400	Five did seem excessive and they're probably privy to all these people that have formed these little clubs about sharing the codes and so forth, or sharing the content.
7210400	7211400	So, I'm not too surprised.
7211400	7217400	Two seems reasonable. One downstairs, one upstairs, or one in the bedroom, one in the living room.
7217400	7221400	Well, and the fact that you can deactivate them, too. I don't know if you could deactivate the ones when it's five.
7221400	7222400	Oh, good point.
7222400	7225400	So, that would be... I think that's fair.
7225400	7228400	That would be good if you fry one PS3 and you have to get another one.
7228400	7232400	You can add it onto that and you can deactivate it once you get the new one.
7232400	7233400	Very true.
7233400	7237400	So, that's good. And not too surprising that they've clamped down on that.
7237400	7243400	But again, that's not retroactive, right? So, any old games you've already bought are under the five license.
7243400	7244400	That's right.
7244400	7248400	So, the clubs aren't really getting shut down. It's just, you know, you're not gonna be able to do it much longer.
7248400	7249400	Yeah.
7249400	7256400	Well, here's one of the games that you won't be sharing with five different people, which is too bad because it's gonna be a pretty big party game.
7256400	7260400	Now, if you've ever played this card game at a party, you know how much fun it can be.
7260400	7262400	Apples to apples. Have you ever played this?
7262400	7263400	Love it.
7263400	7270400	Yes. This is the game where you have a card on a green card and the green card is some type of, like, verb.
7270400	7272400	Like, I don't know, like...
7272400	7274400	It's usually an adjective, I think.
7274400	7276400	Yeah, like an adjective. Like...
7276400	7277400	Tasty.
7277400	7282400	Yeah, tasty. And then the red cards all have, like, nouns on them. Like, the 90s.
7282400	7286400	Or the card that will always win every round, including, like, tasty.
7286400	7289400	You put down Helen Keller. Always wins the round, right?
7289400	7293400	And then, because everybody votes on which card is the funniest for that.
7293400	7300400	Well, this game is going to be coming out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this holiday season.
7300400	7302400	I'm gonna play the shit out of this.
7302400	7307400	CHQ is doing it and apparently they're gonna be adding this social and online connectivity.
7307400	7311400	You're gonna be able to play this anywhere, anytime.
7311400	7318400	It's gonna be interesting to see how it works because, you know, it's not gonna be the same online that it is in person, but...
7318400	7323400	Or that it is drunk on pineapple malibu in the hotel room.
7323400	7326400	There will be single, local, and six player online play.
7326400	7328400	You're gonna have golden apple cards.
7328400	7330400	How do you play single player?
7330400	7331400	It's kinda dumb, huh?
7331400	7335400	Golden apple cards, which will be used to change the rules.
7335400	7338400	There's gonna be Facebook support as well.
7338400	7342400	Download content. Of course, more cards and all the same stuff you saw in Uno.
7342400	7346400	800 Microsoft Points, $9.99 on PlayStation 3.
7346400	7349400	And the game will be expanding to Facebook and so forth later on.
7349400	7352400	It's one of those things where, like, God, I love the party game.
7352400	7357400	But online, like, if I'm not playing with friends, I don't know how this is gonna be much fun.
7357400	7359400	Like, with strangers, it's gonna be stupid.
7359400	7361400	You know what I mean?
7361400	7362400	You know what would be awesome?
7362400	7363400	What?
7363400	7365400	Uh, what was it?
7365400	7367400	Eat Poop, You Cat.
7367400	7370400	Oh, yeah, God. Explain that game real quick.
7370400	7371400	That's a fun game.
7371400	7378400	Eat Poop, You Cat is basically, uh, visual telephone, I guess.
7378400	7382400	You start off by writing a phrase, and you pass it to the next person.
7382400	7387400	They draw a picture of that phrase, and then you basically obscure the original phrase,
7387400	7391400	and the next person tries, they write a phrase based on what the drawing is,
7391400	7396400	and it keeps on going from there with, you know, more drawings and phrases and so forth.
7396400	7399400	Until you get to the end, you're like, what the hell?
7399400	7401400	It's really obscure.
7401400	7403400	It's a really fun party game, and it's pen and paper.
7403400	7404400	You don't need anything else.
7404400	7405400	It's great.
7405400	7407400	Yes, but it'd be awesome to see.
7407400	7409400	It turned dirty so fast.
7409400	7411400	You have to do it on the DS or something where you can draw.
7411400	7415400	But, uh, yeah, apples to apples will be interesting.
7415400	7417400	It would be cool, like, and if this is what they're talking about, I'm not sure,
7417400	7422400	but, like, if the Xbox can play Facebook, that might be interesting,
7422400	7425400	because it'll make it way more likely that you could actually play your friends,
7425400	7428400	but I'm not, I don't know, I'm not giving them that much credit.
7428400	7430400	That seems kind of complicated.
7430400	7433400	But it would be really cool if they could get that to work somehow.
7433400	7435400	So, there you go.
7435400	7437400	Apples to apples coming soon.
7437400	7439400	Let's, uh, go to our mailbag.
7439400	7444400	Every week you guys send us e-mails, and Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag
7444400	7445400	and reads them.
7445400	7449400	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us e-mails.
7449400	7450400	We got a few.
7450400	7452400	All right, good, because we were off a week.
7452400	7454400	A few.
7454400	7457400	So, first off, hey guys, Molten Brown here.
7457400	7461400	I heard you talking about rugby games last week, and I felt I had to chime in.
7461400	7465400	I've been playing rugby for six years now, and it is awesome.
7465400	7469400	I am really happy with the increase in rugby games this year,
7469400	7472400	considering how popular this sport is worldwide.
7472400	7477400	Regarding the increase, I may be because the Rugby World Cup is going on right now.
7477400	7480400	I would say more, but I'm not feeling well, so I'm just going to peace out.
7480400	7482400	Later, Molten Brown.
7482400	7483400	Aw, feel better.
7483400	7485400	I mean, rugby is awesome, don't get me wrong,
7485400	7487400	but you got to admit, it is a little weird.
7487400	7488400	Like, rugby doesn't quite get –
7488400	7489400	Violent.
7489400	7492400	It's an ESPN2 sport, let's put it that way.
7492400	7493400	I'm not knocking it.
7493400	7494400	It's awesome.
7494400	7495400	It's just, you know, not –
7495400	7496400	Only in America is it an ESPN2 sport.
7496400	7497400	That's true.
7497400	7498400	That's very true.
7498400	7501400	But it is surprising that all of a sudden all these rugby games are coming out in America,
7501400	7503400	but you make a good point about the Rugby World Cup.
7503400	7506400	I mean, if it's on people's minds, then they're more likely to buy the games.
7506400	7507400	Good point.
7507400	7509400	All right, next one.
7509400	7510400	Hey guys, have you seen this?
7510400	7512400	It's dragcave.net.
7512400	7516400	Some of them miss adorable dragons in someone's signature on the Jim Butcher forums.
7516400	7519400	Anyway, you click on them or view them to help them hatch and grow.
7519400	7520400	It has its own Wiki.
7520400	7523400	I haven't had time to really look into it too much,
7523400	7526400	but I'm hoping to hatch my little signature eggs.
7526400	7529400	Any tips if you guys have played it?
7529400	7531400	It strikes me as a much nicer sort of Neopets.
7531400	7532400	That's from Holly.
7532400	7536400	I was just about to say, I'm hearing Neopets, but interesting.
7536400	7539400	So it's something you, like, put it in your signature and you get a lot of clicks
7539400	7541400	and people hatch it.
7541400	7548400	That's a good, um, that's a good get people on our website scheme.
7548400	7549400	It's kind of smart.
7549400	7550400	Yeah, it is.
7550400	7551400	No, I've never played it.
7551400	7552400	I looked at the site.
7552400	7553400	It looks kind of neat, but no, I haven't tried it.
7553400	7554400	Sorry.
7554400	7555400	Sorry.
7555400	7558400	Yeah, I can't say a whole lot on that, but I'll have to look at it.
7558400	7559400	Okay.
7559400	7560400	We got one from Rababa.
7560400	7561400	Rababa.
7561400	7565400	The paranormal pinball table is apparently free on Xbox Live Arcade this week with only
7565400	7569400	a few days left when you broadcast.
7569400	7571400	The pinball on PSN has had it for months.
7571400	7576400	I know the narrator of the game is supposed to be a Sam Spade sound-alike, but it is clearly
7576400	7579400	the actor who voices Peter Griffin on the Family Guy.
7579400	7580400	Oh my.
7580400	7584400	Still, it's a fun table that may be guilty of trying to do too many things at once.
7584400	7586400	Apparently, let me see if I can see it.
7586400	7589400	Wait, isn't Peter Griffin the creator of the show?
7589400	7590400	Seth.
7590400	7591400	Yeah, Peter.
7591400	7592400	It's Seth MacFarlane.
7592400	7595400	I don't think they would have got him to do a video game.
7595400	7596400	They must have sound really similar.
7596400	7602400	I'm looking at the table itself, just for a moment, and it kind of seems to me like,
7602400	7606400	yeah, it's trying to be sort of like Twilight Zone.
7606400	7608400	Although the ramps are crazy on it.
7608400	7609400	Wow.
7609400	7611400	Yeah, I'm pissed I forgot to get this.
7611400	7618400	It's probably like a knockoff of Twilight Zone versus whodunit, you know?
7618400	7619400	Anyway.
7619400	7623400	Okay, we have one from, I'm just, oh, it's from CD Thunder.
7623400	7624400	Okay.
7624400	7630400	Hello, Alara, I went to the mall recently and played in the game room for a while.
7630400	7632400	During my visit, I noticed that two of my favorite games were gone.
7632400	7634400	CarnEvil and House of the Dead.
7634400	7636400	At least you have a game room still.
7636400	7638400	Yeah, at least you have an arcade with actual games.
7638400	7641400	I figured they were gone because of the sale the game room was always having.
7641400	7642400	The prices looked outrageous.
7642400	7644400	One was going for 800 bucks.
7644400	7648400	Lastly, I got a DS game with all four original Sonic the Hedgehog games on it.
7648400	7651400	Keep up four original, oh, maybe Spinball.
7651400	7654400	Keep up the good work, sincerely CD Thunder.
7654400	7656400	Or maybe Sonic and Knuckles.
7656400	7657400	Could be 3D Blast.
7657400	7658400	Maybe.
7658400	7660400	Do you know I have two copies of that on Saturn?
7660400	7661400	Do you really?
7661400	7662400	How funny.
7662400	7665400	Yeah, the whole sale of arcade games, too.
7665400	7667400	I mean, you see that, what's that place at the Metreon?
7667400	7669400	Tilt was selling a bunch of games.
7669400	7671400	And yeah, usually they are going to be a couple hundred dollars.
7671400	7676400	I mean, keep in mind, dude, you got just a whole game console slash television
7676400	7681400	slash stand-up cabinet slash fancy controller all dedicated to one game.
7681400	7682400	That does cost a couple hundred bucks.
7682400	7683400	You can look at Craigslist.
7683400	7686400	You can find a lot of old arcade games for that kind of price.
7686400	7689400	But yeah, cabinets are about that price.
7689400	7691400	And the more elaborate, the more expensive.
7691400	7693400	Someday when I have a house, I'll have some arcade machines.
7693400	7694400	Someday.
7694400	7696400	All right, so are we ready for the next email?
7696400	7697400	Yes.
7697400	7700400	Okay, hello, OLR.
7700400	7702400	Since we are near the release of Sonic Generations this Tuesday,
7702400	7706400	I thought you guys would like to compare some of the music from the game.
7706400	7709400	Yeah, there's remixes up.
7709400	7712400	Rob, you should probably pull up this email because the remix is on here.
7712400	7714400	Sure, I'll pull it up right now.
7714400	7719400	But it has a classic remix of Speed Highway from Sonic Adventure,
7719400	7722400	which was one of my favorite pieces of music in that game.
7722400	7725400	A modernized Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone,
7725400	7731400	and a classic rooftop run from Sonic Unleashed, which I think I played.
7731400	7734400	Also, it's worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations
7734400	7740400	out on November 22nd has its own set of levels to make it unique.
7740400	7747400	Okay, turn this up so I can hear this.
7747400	7752400	I approve.
7752400	7754400	I've been hearing a lot of good things about Sonic Generations.
7754400	7757400	I'm just going to post this one on the Tumblr.
7757400	7758400	Go for it.
7758400	7761400	It's also worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations
7761400	7767400	has its own set of levels to make it unique from the PC 360 and PS3 versions.
7767400	7769400	I hope you and your listeners enjoy sampling these tracks.
7769400	7771400	Good day.
7771400	7774400	And this comes from Full Brazilian.
7774400	7781400	Ouch.
7781400	7785400	Oh yeah, the Green Hill.
7785400	7788400	There's a Chemical Plant.
7788400	7790400	All right, last one.
7790400	7791400	Chemical Plant Zone.
7791400	7794400	I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.
7794400	7795400	Whoops.
7795400	7802400	Come on.
7802400	7806400	But I really like that Speed Highway.
7806400	7814400	I want to see the gameplay.
7814400	7818400	That's pretty sweet actually.
7818400	7820400	Yeah, I saw a little bit of it.
7820400	7825400	I really do want that.
7825400	7831400	Because it looks like it's really going back to some of the Sonic Adventure stuff.
7831400	7835400	Which Sonic Adventure is probably one of, it's on my list of favorites.
7835400	7837400	Okay, I've got to be honest.
7837400	7840400	I haven't been paying this game much attention because let's be real.
7840400	7841400	Can we all be real for a minute?
7841400	7844400	Sonic's been really shitty for a long time.
7844400	7848400	And, you know, like especially once Sonic 4 kind of came out and it was kind of thud.
7848400	7851400	You know, like I just kind of say, oh, Sonic game.
7851400	7853400	I'm sure it's more shit.
7853400	7855400	But I got to say, I'm looking at that.
7855400	7858400	That looks nice.
7858400	7860400	Let me look at another.
7860400	7868400	Now that I'm fucking on this, I want to see another little video here.
7868400	7872400	I'm doing a tutorial here.
7872400	7873400	I think this is that same area.
7873400	7875400	Let me skip ahead a lot here.
7875400	7876400	All right.
7876400	7878400	Well, I'll go ahead and read the next email if you want.
7878400	7880400	Yeah, I'm entranced by the Sonic video.
7880400	7882400	It looks pretty awesome.
7882400	7884400	Yeah, because it's sort of.
7884400	7886400	God, it makes me want to barf from all the motion though.
7886400	7893400	It goes from like a 2.5D to a full, you know, Sonic Adventure style.
7893400	7894400	Yeah.
7894400	7897400	Really want, actually you know what game this makes me think of right off the bat?
7897400	7898400	What?
7898400	7901400	Sonic CD.
7901400	7903400	With how fluid it is.
7903400	7904400	I want to hear from the chat room.
7904400	7906400	If you guys in chat have been playing this, is it good?
7906400	7910400	Like is this a Sonic game that I should be paying attention to?
7910400	7914400	Or is this one of those things that looks cool, but it doesn't play so hot?
7914400	7916400	It looks like it plays pretty classic though.
7916400	7917400	All right.
7917400	7918400	So shall I go ahead and give you the last two?
7918400	7919400	Yes, please.
7919400	7920400	Sorry, I'll close the video.
7920400	7921400	Keep watching.
7921400	7922400	I don't care.
7922400	7932400	Weeks after Cliffy slammed a site for giving Gears 3 an 8.0, the big sites are running stories about gamers criticizing Uncharted 3 getting an 8 score as well.
7932400	7944400	Am I off base here, or do you think the more the vocal gamers, disregarding the factors that lead to the number score, are more willing to accept a 4 out of 5 rating as being a great game over an 8 of 10 being an 80% or an 80%?
7944400	7948400	Keep on Robert M.
7948400	7964400	It really is a matter of numbers and perception because with a 4 out of 5, you've got that 4 so close to the top line, but then an 8 though has two more levels of gradation between it even though it is in theory the exact same rating.
7964400	7967400	So I think it's just a matter of perception.
7967400	7969400	People are easily swayed.
7969400	7971400	Don't look at the numbers.
7971400	7972400	Look at the content.
7972400	7973400	That's what I have to say.
7973400	7980400	It's ironic because one of the things I got linked to in our chat room as you're reading that email is the Metacritic for Sonic Generations.
7980400	7983400	So I'm kind of taking a look at some of the scores.
7983400	7986400	It has a 77 on Metacritic, which, you know, I don't...
7986400	7993400	You have to really watch these websites because you're not going to necessarily agree with one or the other.
7993400	7995400	But some people on here...
7995400	7996400	It has 77 overall.
7996400	7999400	Nobody's rated it anything higher than like an 8.5.
7999400	8004400	But some folks are saying it's good, it's polished.
8004400	8014400	But then some of the people that are dogging it a little bit like say it's not as good as colors, it's not very creative, and it feels like filler.
8014400	8018400	And saying that it's just they're shoehorning old Sonic games.
8018400	8021400	Interesting.
8021400	8025400	Of course, if they want me to spend 60 bucks on it, it's got to be better than average, right?
8025400	8027400	So...
8027400	8028400	Maybe we'll get some calls on that later.
8028400	8029400	I don't know.
8029400	8030400	Anything else in the mailbag?
8030400	8031400	Yes, we do.
8031400	8032400	Alrighty.
8032400	8033400	Um...
8033400	8034400	As soon as I get back to the email...
8034400	8037400	Okay, um, the last one is, um, hi, OLR.
8037400	8040400	It's your friendly neighborhood spazzinator.
8040400	8049400	I really don't have a gaming-related topic for this week's show, but rather I was hoping that the three of you could possibly send out a happy birthday wish to a first-time listener.
8049400	8050400	Nope.
8050400	8051400	Yes.
8051400	8052400	Alright.
8052400	8058400	This is Angie, AKA Gigi, whose birthday is today. That's 11-6.
8058400	8062400	I couldn't possibly ask for a better friend than her, thanks in advance.
8062400	8065400	Okay, happy birthday, Gigi!
8065400	8066400	Happy birthday.
8066400	8067400	Happy birthday.
8067400	8070400	Happy birthday to you.
8070400	8073400	From Orange Lounge Radio.
8073400	8076400	You need to come up with an OLR birthday song.
8076400	8079400	It's your birthday! Good for you!
8079400	8084400	It's your birthday, here's some poo.
8084400	8086400	Happy birthday, for reals.
8086400	8087400	There you go.
8087400	8089400	Actually, or there's this.
8089400	8091400	Hold on, let me see if I can do this here.
8091400	8095400	We could do happy birthday this way.
8095400	8097400	Come on, play.
8097400	8100400	Play, fool!
8100400	8101400	Oh, this is so weird.
8101400	8102400	Fail.
8102400	8104400	I'm waiting for someone to click the freaking play button on this.
8104400	8105400	Here we go.
8105400	8116400	It's Happy Birthday on Mario Paint.
8116400	8118400	Do you know something, Rob?
8118400	8119400	I tried.
8119400	8120400	Did you know something?
8120400	8124400	That that song actually is still under copyright law, and that if more than 25 people perform
8124400	8127400	it in public, you can be sued for public performance.
8127400	8129400	Oh, well, you know what you're gonna get from me?
8129400	8130400	Nothing, because I'm broke.
8130400	8131400	How about some farts?
8131400	8132400	Exactly.
8132400	8134400	I can spare that.
8134400	8137400	I have farts in your general direction.
8137400	8138400	Okay, that's it.
8138400	8140400	I played under 30 seconds, that's fair use.
8140400	8142400	All right, that's it for the mailbag.
8142400	8145400	Send us emails, we'll read your emails, and I guess now we'll do your birthday wishes
8145400	8146400	on the show.
8146400	8147400	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8147400	8149400	Because Jamie's nice.
8149400	8151400	Again, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8151400	8155400	Don't catch her when she's in a bad mood or she'll tell your friend, so what, it's your
8155400	8157400	birthday, screw you.
8157400	8178400	And maybe, just maybe, she'll mention you during a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
8178400	8182400	My FU of the Week goes to the cold that I've had for the last two weeks, especially since
8182400	8188400	I got sick at Disneyland.
8188400	8197400	And a secondary FU goes towards, um, and it's, I'm really trying to be understanding and
8197400	8204500	thoughtful, but learn how to package an InDesign file, please, instead of having me have to
8204500	8209520	go back and fix all of the damn work because it was not packaged properly with all the
8209520	8215520	proper link syntax, oh fuck you, InDesign, fuck you so much, I love you, but fuck you.
8215520	8217520	I'm done.
8217520	8218520	Loki?
8218520	8225520	Um, FU to Activision, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, it's always a pain in the ass every
8225520	8232000	goddamn year when it launches, just with all the regulation, and this customer can't have
8232000	8237520	it this time, and everybody's calling and bitching, and I'm gonna sue, and blah blah
8237520	8244520	blah, and yadda yadda yadda, and so, yeah, fuck you to Call of Duty.
8244520	8250020	Um, my FU of the Week goes to the country fried steak I had this morning, because seriously,
8250020	8252520	deep fried steak, like, what the hell's that?
8252520	8257520	Um, but, um, no actually it was really good, that's why I'm giving it an FU, because, um,
8257520	8263520	FU to the fact that I'll have to play, like, two hours of Damn Central 2 to work that off.
8263520	8267520	FU to good tasting food being so bad for you.
8267520	8272520	Alright, more news stories, and then we're gonna get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
8272520	8275520	but not just yet, we still have some more news stories.
8275520	8276520	Loki?
8276520	8281520	Yes, um, of course, one of the things we like to complain about is pay to unlock content,
8281520	8288520	basically content that's DLC that's already on the disc, and so, one such game, the high
8288520	8294520	profile game you might add, um, that has such a thing would be Gears of War 3, and of course,
8294520	8303520	uh, the creator, um, Rod Ferguson, is, uh, defending why they do have, uh, pay to unlock
8303520	8306520	content, or DLC that's already on the disc.
8306520	8307520	Can't wait to hear this.
8307520	8313520	Uh, basically saying, I love this, we're not saying everything on the disc is product,
8313520	8322520	uh, the disc is another delivery mechanism, so basically their thought is that, um, because
8322520	8328520	the game was actually done back in the spring, and they kinda held it until the fall, um,
8328520	8334520	they had already created some of this download content that was gonna be put out there, um,
8334520	8341520	and basically, um, you know, uh, they wanted, the first piece of download content had some,
8341520	8346520	you know, guns and maps and stuff that they needed to have, uh, the data for, for people
8346520	8352520	that didn't buy it so that you could play with those people and whatnot, um, instead
8352520	8356520	of just having you download all that again, they just put it on the disc to make it easier
8356520	8360520	so you didn't have to download everything, but obviously going forward, any other download
8360520	8366520	content will be, the entire contents will have to be downloaded, um, you know, they
8366520	8370520	said, we felt it was a win-win, because no one was going, no one is going to have to
8370520	8377520	download anything huge when the DLC comes out, um, but, I mean, I understand that, but
8377520	8382520	I think, you know, the whole problem with people seeing this is, like, you get things
8382520	8386520	like with the Catwoman DLC and stuff, where it's just, like, it's already on disc, but,
8386520	8391520	you know, obviously if you didn't buy the game new, you have to pay to unlock the content.
8391520	8394520	Well, you do have, like, 200 megs to download, because I just did that today.
8394520	8396520	There's, it's downloading something.
8396520	8398520	Okay, so that is download content.
8398520	8400520	Well, okay, Katamari.
8400520	8401520	Yeah, the beautiful Katamari.
8401520	8405520	The beautiful Katamari had, you know, a lot of pay to unlock levels and stuff like that,
8405520	8410520	and it's not, you know, it's not the first game, obviously, to have that kind of stuff,
8410520	8415520	but people kind of seem insulted when, you know, there's stuff, you know, you finish
8415520	8419520	it and you put it on the disc, you know, you could have just added some more content for
8419520	8424520	the release game instead of just releasing what you had back in the spring and then adding
8424520	8428520	some download content later on that I had to pay extra for, for stuff that's already on disc.
8428520	8430520	That's what the complaint is.
8430520	8437520	One of the comments there, I think the thing is that makes it money for people is when it's on disc.
8437520	8443520	We could have left it off and, you know, hey, there's, here's another disc,
8443520	8446520	but they believe that they did the right thing.
8446520	8449520	So, I don't know.
8449520	8453520	I'm sure they're gonna make a shit ton of money anyway, you know, it doesn't even matter.
8453520	8457520	But it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of frustrating, delivery mechanism.
8457520	8461520	Well, I mean, Ridge Racer did it with all their music.
8461520	8463520	It was all unlocked content.
8463520	8467520	I remember those, you know, having the keys, Dead Rising has costumes and stuff.
8467520	8470520	It's, there's a lot of games that do it.
8470520	8474520	And I think it's kind of lame because you're like, you have this stuff done.
8474520	8479520	It's not like the game was, I mean, I get some games are delayed or purposefully held
8479520	8484520	to come out at a certain time, but not all games are like that.
8484520	8487520	There's a lot of games where it's like, okay, we added some extra, you know,
8487520	8492520	DLC content like the Earth Defense Force expansions were already on the disc,
8492520	8495520	all those weapons, and they're charging people for it.
8495520	8497520	Can we take a minute to praise somebody that did it right?
8497520	8500520	And that would be the folks behind Burnout Paradise.
8500520	8503520	And you want to talk about combating used game sales.
8503520	8507520	Well, the way you combat used game sales is to make people want to keep the game
8507520	8511520	and not want to sell it back by doing regular content updates.
8511520	8515520	Dude, what if you'd, instead of having, you know,
8515520	8518520	people pay to unlock the additional content that's on the disc,
8518520	8522520	why not slowly unlock that content over, you know, every couple months,
8522520	8526520	something new unlocks, give people reason to hold on to their games
8526520	8528520	and not want to sell them used.
8528520	8532520	What a novel idea.
8532520	8537520	Or, you know, then you have also, besides the slowly unlocking content,
8537520	8541520	you have some really cool download content later on that, you know,
8541520	8544520	it's like, you know, people that sell their games back are like,
8544520	8547520	man, man, I really need to buy that again so I can buy this download content.
8547520	8550520	That's good download content if, you know,
8550520	8553520	you're willing to re-buy that game to play that content.
8553520	8556520	Spaznator PC in our chat room says, this begs a question, though,
8556520	8560520	at which point will we have $60 for a game,
8560520	8563520	and then pay additional money to unlock the whole game?
8563520	8565520	How about the new Mortal Kombat game that came out?
8565520	8568520	I mean, you had to pay money for the extra characters.
8568520	8570520	I mean, I guess you could say that's extra or whatever.
8570520	8574520	But how about Arkham City, the Catwoman stuff?
8574520	8577520	I guess you could say, okay, well, the code does come with the game,
8577520	8580520	but, you know, there are a bunch of trophies and story elements
8580520	8583520	that if you don't have that code, you're not going to get.
8583520	8588520	Or, heaven forbid, you got one of those boxes where the code is missing.
8588520	8590520	Even though, I guess, Warner Brothers has a little workaround,
8590520	8594520	but still, it's an awful inconvenience to the consumer.
8594520	8596520	Battlefield will have the same problem?
8596520	8598520	Oh, yeah.
8598520	8604520	So, I mean, sure, there'll be more maps for Halo and, you know, whatever.
8604520	8607520	It's amazing. If you just think of the long term,
8607520	8610520	I bet you could use game sales easy
8610520	8613520	by continuing to provide the regular content to keep it exciting.
8613520	8615520	Arkham City, for example.
8615520	8618520	You beat the game, but you haven't finished the game.
8618520	8620520	There's so much more to do.
8620520	8622520	Right. Let's see.
8622520	8625520	There is a big show coming up in a couple weeks
8625520	8627520	where they show a lot of arcade games,
8627520	8631520	and one of the rumors going around about this upcoming arcade show
8631520	8635520	is that Bejeweled is going to show up as an amusement title.
8635520	8638520	Yeah, apparently one of the biggest casual games ever,
8638520	8642520	Sega Amusements, is supposed to be showing this.
8642520	8646520	Now, this could just be a huge rumor, but they are saying that Bejeweled
8646520	8649520	could be just like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade and so forth
8649520	8653520	that could be making its way from a casual game to the arcade.
8653520	8657520	Here's my question. Is it going to spit out tickets?
8657520	8661520	Because that seems to be the only way the games last in the arcade these days.
8661520	8664520	What would you guys think of a Bejeweled arcade game?
8664520	8666520	I wouldn't play it.
8666520	8669520	I like Bejeweled, and if it spits out tickets,
8669520	8671520	it'll be a good ticket-spitting game.
8671520	8673520	I'm really sad that I'm admitting this,
8673520	8676520	but otherwise would I pay to play it in the arcades?
8676520	8679520	Not unless it gives me some type of experience I can't get at home,
8679520	8683520	which I doubt, unless it's like, I don't know,
8683520	8688520	really somehow touch-based and somehow really fun and different,
8688520	8691520	but I just don't see how many ways you do Bejeweled.
8691520	8693520	Don't get me wrong, Bejeweled is a great game,
8693520	8695520	but is it worth 50 cents to play good?
8695520	8702520	Sure. So, we'll see.
8702520	8705520	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news,
8705520	8707520	Dark Sakura, while I try to get the livestream up,
8707520	8709520	because we crashed again. Hooray!
8709520	8714520	Aw, boo. Well, LEGO Universe is going away.
8714520	8717520	Aw, so sad.
8717520	8721520	Because they're not getting enough players.
8721520	8726520	They haven't got enough players and enough paying subscribers,
8726520	8731520	so LEGO Universe is going to be closing on January 31st, 2012.
8731520	8736520	And they are also going to be closing the Playwell studio,
8736520	8742520	which will be laying off 115 people. Sadness.
8742520	8745520	That is sad. Again, more job losses. That's sad.
8745520	8747520	But I didn't even, okay, this is sad,
8747520	8750520	but I didn't even realize LEGO Universe was out.
8750520	8752520	It was supposed to be this big MMO, right?
8752520	8754520	It came out about a year ago.
8754520	8756520	Was it supposed to be out on DS or something?
8756520	8758520	Like, it was supposed to be an MMO on the 3DS or something?
8758520	8760520	Am I crazy?
8760520	8762520	No, you're thinking of...
8762520	8764520	Oh, what is it?
8764520	8766520	The one that's like Grand Theft Auto.
8766520	8772520	It's LEGO City Stories, which I will be buying.
8772520	8774520	Ah, that's it.
8774520	8776520	I will be buying LEGO City Stories.
8776520	8778520	Okay, I gotta confuse LEGO City Stories.
8778520	8780520	Alright.
8780520	8782520	But yeah, it's basically not enough players,
8782520	8784520	not enough paying people, so they can't afford to keep it open.
8784520	8786520	Interesting that they didn't decide to go free to...
8786520	8788520	Oh, no, they already were free to play, weren't they?
8788520	8790520	Oh, bummer.
8790520	8792520	And the quote says,
8792520	8794520	It has not been possible to convert a satisfactory number of players
8794520	8796520	to paying subscribers.
8796520	8798520	In other words, ain't no one playing this.
8798520	8800520	No, ain't no one paying for it.
8800520	8802520	They just want to play the free stuff.
8802520	8804520	Sure.
8804520	8806520	They don't want to pay for content.
8806520	8808520	They just want to play the free stuff.
8808520	8810520	I'm curious to see if DC Universe is able to make money.
8810520	8812520	That'd be interesting.
8812520	8814520	Oh, I'm sure.
8814520	8816520	Well, of course you have so many people that already bought it.
8816520	8818520	And if you pay five bucks for it,
8818520	8820520	for, like, content,
8820520	8822520	you get an account upgrade.
8822520	8824520	The same thing as with Star Trek Online.
8824520	8826520	That's why when I start Star Trek Online,
8826520	8828520	I'm automatically going in with the middle-level account.
8828520	8830520	Oh, that's cool.
8830520	8832520	Because you've paid for it in the past.
8832520	8834520	Well, apart from, yeah, my subscription,
8834520	8836520	I bought Cryptic Points
8836520	8838520	so that I could get
8838520	8840520	the extra uniforms
8840520	8842520	and the other ship and stuff.
8842520	8844520	But honestly,
8844520	8846520	I haven't spent more than 20 bucks outside on that game.
8846520	8848520	Just a couple more news stories for you guys,
8848520	8850520	and then we're going to get into
8850520	8852520	the Skype line and your Twitter topics
8852520	8854520	at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, so last chance
8854520	8856520	to get those in. Loki.
8856520	8858520	Ah, yes. So, as we mentioned
8858520	8860520	before, the Mass Effect 3
8860520	8862520	beta has
8862520	8864520	leaked out.
8864520	8866520	Apparently, there was a private
8866520	8868520	closed beta for Mass Effect 3,
8868520	8870520	and somehow they kind of
8870520	8872520	accidentally threw it up on there for everybody to download.
8872520	8874520	And, you know, it gives
8874520	8876520	people access to both
8876520	8878520	single-player and multiplayer sections of the game.
8878520	8880520	And, of course, because of that, there's been
8880520	8882520	lots of screenshots and whatnot
8882520	8884520	showing, you know, different things
8884520	8886520	like origin support, multiplayer character
8886520	8888520	creation, level selection,
8888520	8890520	stats,
8890520	8892520	you know,
8892520	8894520	new user interfaces and whatnot.
8894520	8896520	So, uh,
8896520	8898520	neat. Of course, the game
8898520	8900520	will be coming out in February.
8900520	8902520	It's not February, March. I know it's
8902520	8904520	spring.
8904520	8906520	Lots of stuff coming out in the spring.
8908520	8910520	Alright.
8910520	8912520	Well, yeah, Mass Effect's going to be a huge one, though.
8912520	8914520	But, oops on that leak, right?
8914520	8916520	Yep. Not much.
8916520	8918520	It's not really a closed beta if you put it out for everybody.
8918520	8920520	Well, that was a Microsoft booboo
8920520	8922520	from what I understand. Man, I would be
8922520	8924520	pissed if I were them.
8924520	8926520	So.
8926520	8928520	Alright, moving on to
8928520	8930520	one more story for you guys, and
8930520	8932520	this goes back to the music games.
8932520	8934520	DDR, of course, getting a new version.
8934520	8936520	But they're redoing Second Mix. Remember, we talked about
8936520	8938520	the new arcade mix that's going to have Second Mix inside it?
8938520	8940520	Well, to celebrate Dance Dance
8940520	8942520	Revolution X3 versus Second Mix,
8942520	8944520	there's going to be a new
8944520	8946520	Second Mix soundtrack that includes
8946520	8948520	remixes. They are remixing
8948520	8950520	Keep On Movin' by Y and Co.
8950520	8952520	Y and Co.
8952520	8954520	Put Your Faith in Me by
8954520	8956520	DA's Twinkly Disco Remix.
8956520	8958520	Trip Machine, the
8958520	8960520	Zack Nonoglide mix, Brilliant
8960520	8962520	to You, the AKBK
8962520	8964520	mix, and Paranoia,
8964520	8966520	the KST mix,
8966520	8968520	and Love is the Power, Reborn.
8968520	8970520	I don't remember a song called Love is the Power.
8970520	8972520	I think it was one of the menu ones.
8972520	8974520	Oh, that's why. Got it.
8974520	8976520	And apparently there's going to be a special
8976520	8978520	DVD that has videos
8978520	8980520	for Butterfly Boom Boom Dollar
8980520	8982520	and Brilliant to You. Interviews
8982520	8984520	with Naoki, Yuwan,
8984520	8986520	DJ Taka, Y and Co,
8986520	8988520	so on and so on. That's all coming out November 30th
8988520	8990520	is when the soundtrack comes out. That means the arcade
8990520	8992520	game is going to be out soon. I kind of
8992520	8994520	want to go play it just to play Second Mix mode.
8994520	8996520	Forget these newfangled
8996520	8998520	songs. You know what, Rob? What?
8998520	9000520	I can hook up the Dreamcast, and we can play
9000520	9002520	Second Mix. It's just not the same as
9002520	9004520	Dance Battle, Rob. A pretty high-def TV.
9004520	9006520	Because didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about
9006520	9008520	how they were redoing the graphics in HD
9008520	9010520	and all that? And it sounded kind of neat.
9010520	9012520	You know, for us super music
9012520	9014520	game nerd fans, it sounded super neat. You know what?
9014520	9016520	What? I completely
9016520	9018520	forgot that it was on my phone, but I
9018520	9020520	actually giggled in my car the
9020520	9022520	other day because Love came on my iPhone.
9022520	9024520	Oh, really? I forgot I had the whole
9024520	9026520	Sonic Dreams CD
9026520	9028520	when it came out. Nice. Very nice.
9028520	9030520	Alright, yeah.
9030520	9032520	In our chatroom it says, Love is the power is the ending
9032520	9034520	of Second Mix, isn't it? Yeah, I think you're right. Now that you're saying it,
9034520	9036520	I'm like, yeah, that sounds right.
9036520	9038520	There you go. There you have it.
9038520	9040520	Let's move on to the Skype line.
9040520	9042520	1877 Game O-L-R
9042520	9044520	or a username on Skype is
9044520	9046520	OrangeLoungeRadio. We are, after all, the
9046520	9048520	show where every gamer has a voice.
9048520	9050520	So give us a call if you want. OrangeLoungeRadio
9050520	9052520	on Skype or 1877
9052520	9054520	Game O-L-R.
9054520	9056520	Meanwhile, let's go
9056520	9058520	to some tweets.
9058520	9060520	On the Twitter, NicoNicoChan
9060520	9062520	tweeted us this week at Twitter.com
9062520	9064520	slash O-L-R and put, Have any
9064520	9066520	of you played the game Hyper
9066520	9068520	Dimension Neptunia?
9068520	9070520	Does this sound familiar to anyone? Yeah, it does
9070520	9072520	sound familiar. It's on the PlayStation. I
9072520	9074520	had to read up on it. It's on the PlayStation
9074520	9076520	3 and it's kind of like,
9076520	9078520	well, this is what I thought was
9078520	9080520	interesting. It's the console wars
9080520	9082520	as represented
9082520	9084520	by female
9084520	9086520	anime chicks.
9086520	9088520	Yes, there's that.
9088520	9090520	I didn't expect anime chicks to be female. There's two
9090520	9092520	things that made me think this was very interesting
9092520	9094520	and one of them was the fact that it's by the company
9094520	9096520	Compile Heart
9096520	9098520	which is actually the dude that used
9098520	9100520	to lead Compile, I guess made this company.
9100520	9102520	Now granted, he left in like 2006
9102520	9104520	or something like that, but I don't know.
9104520	9106520	It kind of gave me hope for like
9106520	9108520	just half a second that maybe just
9108520	9110520	possibly someday
9110520	9112520	it could come, they could come back with
9112520	9114520	they could come back
9114520	9116520	with another version of the Guardian
9116520	9118520	Legend. I would hope so.
9118520	9120520	Or at least another
9120520	9122520	Guardia game.
9122520	9124520	Maybe the franchise
9124520	9126520	could totally work, touched up for the
9126520	9128520	modern era. Right. Yeah.
9128520	9130520	So I was going to try to bring up the YouTube
9130520	9132520	but we're having to deal on the podcast right
9132520	9134520	now with the internet feed
9134520	9136520	being down, so I can't even bring up YouTube
9136520	9138520	because our internet is completely down right now. We're not even
9138520	9140520	live. Live listeners can't hear us.
9140520	9142520	So I'm left with nothing but Twitter because no one
9142520	9144520	can call us either.
9144520	9146520	So let me go to Twitter. I'm keeping an eye on it Rob.
9146520	9148520	I know, thank you.
9148520	9150520	Going to Surtur on the Twitter says
9150520	9152520	I have a new Android phone. What are some good games?
9152520	9154520	Free or money?
9154520	9156520	Love OLR. Thank you.
9156520	9158520	Android games. We all
9158520	9160520	have iOS.
9160520	9162520	I have a shitty Android
9162520	9164520	so I don't play anything on there.
9164520	9166520	Well I mean
9166520	9168520	a lot of the games that are on iOS are also
9168520	9170520	on Android so
9170520	9172520	I'm sure there's
9172520	9174520	pretty much a lot of stuff crosses over.
9174520	9176520	I can't think of any Android
9176520	9178520	specific games that
9178520	9180520	I mean if you have
9180520	9182520	a good enough Android phone I guess
9182520	9184520	so there's also the PlayStation Suite stuff
9184520	9186520	where you can play old PlayStation 1
9186520	9188520	games.
9188520	9190520	MNZeba on Twitter
9190520	9192520	Minecraft
9192520	9194520	if you're into that.
9194520	9196520	That's your thing.
9196520	9198520	MNZeba had sent us a tweet saying
9198520	9200520	OLR I found this while I was walking
9200520	9202520	around Coles. There are so many things
9202520	9204520	wrong with this. I can't bring up the picture again but
9204520	9206520	I actually thankfully I looked at it before
9206520	9208520	we recorded
9208520	9210520	tonight and it was like a picture. It was like a duck
9210520	9212520	hunt game. Yeah I saw that. Did you
9212520	9214520	see that? What the heck was that? It's like a duck
9214520	9216520	hunt. I'm assuming
9216520	9218520	it was one of those plug and play kind of style games.
9218520	9220520	Yeah. Or something. It just looks
9220520	9222520	derpy. It looked a little weird
9222520	9224520	but not completely out of character
9224520	9226520	or you know whatever for those plug and play
9226520	9228520	games.
9230520	9232520	Quick we need a filler topic. I need to
9232520	9234520	relay a message to the chat room real quick.
9234520	9236520	Is this resolved? Oh are we
9236520	9238520	able to come back then? We're connected again.
9238520	9240520	We're up again? We're up again.
9240520	9242520	Oh we are. We are
9242520	9244520	up again. We're just not on
9244520	9246520	the chats.
9246520	9248520	I'm not up yet. I'm showing you the
9248520	9250520	chats. No we just came back on the
9250520	9252520	feed.
9252520	9254520	So there you go.
9254520	9256520	Alright so we're coming back. Sorry
9256520	9258520	podcast listeners but the fun and joy
9258520	9260520	of doing live radio is that sometimes
9260520	9262520	your interwebs gets all screwed up.
9262520	9264520	So we were just reading through
9264520	9266520	some tweets live listeners
9266520	9268520	and we were on that
9268520	9270520	duck hunter game that MNZeba sent us.
9270520	9272520	Now I can see the picture. It says
9272520	9274520	indoor outdoor duck hunting game.
9274520	9276520	It is not a plug and
9276520	9278520	play thing like I originally thought. I guess
9278520	9280520	this thing actually launches
9280520	9282520	fake ducks into the air and
9282520	9284520	you can shoot them. But they say it's safe
9284520	9286520	and fun. But god if you had all
9286520	9288520	those projectiles going around the house
9288520	9290520	wouldn't that be kind of a bad idea?
9290520	9292520	I wouldn't do
9292520	9294520	it inside. I wouldn't do it
9294520	9296520	inside either unless you have like a huge
9296520	9298520	studio empty bedroom. It makes me
9298520	9300520	think though. The dishes are done
9300520	9302520	man.
9302520	9304520	Alright now I can go
9304520	9306520	to some of these links that
9306520	9308520	Tigerclaw sent us because I wasn't able to pull them up
9308520	9310520	before. But on the Twitter. Twitter.com
9310520	9312520	O-L-R. By the way Skype line should be back as you
9312520	9314520	guys are reconnecting to the feed.
9314520	9316520	1877
9316520	9318520	game O-L-R or our username on Skype
9318520	9320520	is OrangeLoungeRadio
9320520	9322520	Tigerclaw had sent us a tweet. Apparently
9322520	9324520	some bandits stole six
9324520	9326520	thousand copies of
9326520	9328520	Modern Warfare 3.
9328520	9330520	In France a truck full
9330520	9332520	of copies of the game was hijacked
9332520	9334520	by professional thieves.
9334520	9336520	The truck was driving through southern Paris
9336520	9338520	on Saturday and it was rammed by
9338520	9340520	another vehicle. Two men emerged
9340520	9342520	from the colliding car with knives
9342520	9344520	used tear gas to
9344520	9346520	subdue the driver and got
9346520	9348520	away with six thousand video games
9348520	9350520	which they are valuing at four hundred
9350520	9352520	thousand euros. That's
9352520	9354520	crazy. But apparently the game was
9354520	9356520	Modern Warfare 3. So if you see
9356520	9358520	some early copies on French eBay
9358520	9360520	you know where it
9360520	9362520	came from. French eBay
9362520	9364520	get it?
9364520	9366520	So
9366520	9368520	there you go.
9368520	9370520	No not French eBay.
9372520	9374520	Alright moving
9374520	9376520	on to another tweet here from Tigerclaw
9376520	9378520	one more. Where in the world
9378520	9380520	is Carmen Sandiego is being turned
9380520	9382520	into a live action film?
9382520	9384520	Is this trolling? Because
9384520	9386520	seriously I clicked on this and
9386520	9388520	Walden Media and
9390520	9392520	Jennifer Lopez
9392520	9394520	are teaming
9394520	9396520	up to do Where in the World is Carmen
9396520	9398520	Sandiego? Please say this
9398520	9400520	is a troll post.
9400520	9402520	Are you trolling us? Is this
9402520	9404520	trolling on Twitter please?
9404520	9406520	Walden Media
9406520	9408520	they're the guys that did the
9408520	9410520	Chronicles of Narnia right? Has acquired the
9410520	9412520	rights to turn Where in the World is Carmen
9412520	9414520	Sandiego into a live action film involving
9414520	9416520	Jennifer Lopez.
9416520	9418520	I guess I could see like
9418520	9420520	like physically that kind of looks right
9420520	9422520	but
9424520	9426520	it could
9426520	9428520	be an interesting movie but I wonder if they're going to
9428520	9430520	make it just like a straight up kids movie.
9430520	9432520	I think that's where they would go with it.
9432520	9434520	You know like kind of like Inspector Gadget
9434520	9436520	or something like that.
9436520	9438520	I don't know. That's what I kind of think.
9438520	9440520	Although I will say this
9440520	9442520	if it doesn't have this as the theme song
9442520	9444520	then I don't
9444520	9446520	if it doesn't have this as the theme song then it doesn't
9446520	9450520	count.
9458520	9460520	Can you imagine
9460520	9462520	Jennifer Lopez featuring
9462520	9464520	Pitbull just ruining this fucking song?
9472520	9474520	Alright. At a theater near you soon
9474520	9476520	apparently.
9476520	9478520	Alright. Again the phone number
9478520	9480520	1877 game OLR username on
9480520	9482520	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to
9482520	9484520	give us a call. And that's all the tweets too. Let me reload
9484520	9486520	just in case things came through and we had the
9486520	9488520	internet downtime that we
9488520	9490520	were having. Did we
9490520	9492520	go down again?
9492520	9494520	This is terrible. What's terrible?
9494520	9496520	I looked up a little bit more
9496520	9498520	information on that
9498520	9500520	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego thing.
9500520	9502520	Here's the film's log line they say.
9502520	9504520	What's a log line?
9504520	9506520	I think it's like the pitch basically.
9506520	9508520	When the ACME agency's
9508520	9510520	greatest detective Carmen
9510520	9512520	Sandiego becomes the world's greatest
9512520	9514520	thief it's up to her former
9514520	9516520	partner to follow her
9516520	9518520	clues and track her down.
9518520	9520520	Their cat and mouse game leads the partner
9520520	9522520	to confront a greater mystery
9522520	9524520	is Carmen really a thief or a
9524520	9526520	hero?
9526520	9528520	Oh great. So Carmen Sandiego may
9528520	9532520	not end up even being like you know a villainous.
9532520	9534520	Yeah.
9534520	9536520	Exactly.
9536520	9538520	Alright.
9538520	9540520	That is it for
9540520	9544520	the tweets tonight.
9544520	9546520	I'm gonna try re-logging into Skype
9546520	9548520	because some folks are telling me that they can't see
9548520	9550520	us on Skype and it might be because we
9550520	9552520	went down while we were on.
9552520	9556520	Yay internet issues. Live radio.
9556520	9558520	Do we have any last minute stories
9558520	9560520	or other stories we didn't get to in the show tonight
9560520	9562520	that we can fill a little time with while I try
9562520	9564520	to get the Skype line working?
9564520	9566520	I like pie and cake
9566520	9568520	and ice cream and
9568520	9570520	fire and um
9570520	9572520	Okay we're up. We're getting calls. There we go.
9572520	9574520	It's finally working. Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9574520	9576520	It's Shane.
9576520	9578520	Hey. Shane AKA Miklatov right?
9578520	9580520	Sure. What's up?
9580520	9582520	Nothing. Just playing some while.
9582520	9584520	Oops. I'm holding down shift and talking in vent.
9584520	9588520	Who are you talking to in vent?
9588520	9590520	Us talking to Todd. We're playing a dungeon.
9590520	9592520	Oh I see. Even though you guys live in the same house
9592520	9594520	and he's upstairs.
9594520	9596520	Yeah. He's upstairs. So it makes it so I don't have to yell.
9596520	9598520	I see. Alright. That's fine.
9598520	9600520	Um.
9600520	9602520	Anyway. What was I talking about?
9602520	9604520	Was I talking about anything yet? Because I don't think I was.
9604520	9606520	No. You were talking about
9606520	9608520	playing WoW and then calling into the show.
9608520	9610520	Oh. Yeah. I'm calling because
9610520	9612520	you said I should call because of Sonic
9612520	9614520	Generations. Oh yeah.
9614520	9616520	Because we actually own it. Do ya? How is it?
9616520	9618520	Yes. It's pretty fantastic
9618520	9620520	and I want to add
9620520	9622520	for a Sonic game after that
9622520	9624520	but it's actually just a
9624520	9626520	pretty good game. Now the Metacritic
9626520	9628520	scores were kind of fair.
9628520	9630520	Fairly good I guess. Not like spectacular
9630520	9632520	but like it's alright. It's pretty
9632520	9634520	good. It was kind of what Metacritic said. Well the thing is
9634520	9636520	with you know a 77%
9636520	9638520	I think you said it was
9638520	9640520	that is you know
9640520	9642520	average. It should be average at least
9642520	9644520	if you go by like the
9644520	9646520	like a school grading scale
9646520	9648520	or it's well above average if you go
9648520	9650520	by a regular grading scale but
9650520	9652520	regardless it's a nice throwback
9652520	9654520	to classic Sonic and the way that
9654520	9656520	Sonic 4 was but a little bit better.
9656520	9658520	Um.
9658520	9660520	And
9660520	9662520	the best part about it to me is
9662520	9664520	all the music because
9664520	9666520	like say you're playing
9666520	9668520	a Sonic adventure level
9668520	9670520	and you're playing as new Sonic
9670520	9672520	and then you go and play as fat old Sonic
9672520	9674520	it changes the music
9674520	9676520	like one of them went to like a synth poppy
9676520	9678520	song because obviously if you're
9678520	9680520	playing on a Genesis you would not have
9680520	9682520	that style CD quality music.
9682520	9684520	What's the whole twist with the new and old Sonic?
9684520	9686520	Like I seriously don't know. I have not been following this game.
9686520	9688520	There's like some
9688520	9690520	evil force and it
9690520	9692520	messes up time and you get
9692520	9694520	thrown around
9694520	9696520	so am I correct in thinking
9696520	9698520	they yet again are cashing in on
9698520	9700520	nostalgic Sonic? Oh yeah
9700520	9702520	because from what I was
9702520	9704520	watching Todd play and it looks like
9704520	9706520	the first three stages are from
9706520	9708520	Sonic 1 the next three are Sonic
9708520	9710520	oh no sorry the first three are Genesis
9710520	9712520	era so it's Sonic 1, 2 and 3
9712520	9714520	and then it's like
9714520	9716520	um gosh dang it
9716520	9718520	I want to say the next is Dreamcast
9718520	9720520	and then the next ones
9720520	9722520	after that are like the newer Sonic
9722520	9724520	games. So it's like a Mario Kart game.
9724520	9726520	A Mario Kart
9726520	9728520	oh like you saw the old track stuff
9728520	9730520	yeah yeah kind of
9730520	9732520	um but seriously it's all about the
9732520	9734520	music when I heard
9734520	9736520	uh just random
9736520	9738520	and to me awesome vocal
9738520	9740520	songs from like the Sonic
9740520	9742520	Dreamcast days I got really excited
9742520	9744520	because I
9744520	9746520	think those songs are amazing. So it's nostalgia that
9746520	9748520	works for you then? Yes and I'm not
9748520	9750520	even a huge fan of Sonic in the least
9750520	9752520	but it is pretty
9752520	9754520	neat. Alright well I'll have to check it out. Is it
9754520	9756520	still 60 bucks though? Yes
9756520	9758520	it is. Well off and on
9758520	9760520	like um at work we had it for
9760520	9762520	39 for a few days
9762520	9764520	that's not as bad. Still
9764520	9766520	there's too many games to play right now. I've got to play
9766520	9768520	Arkham City is really good and then I
9768520	9770520	play Skyrim. I have that and uh
9770520	9772520	I've played it it's okay. You don't like
9772520	9774520	Arkham City? What's wrong with you?
9774520	9776520	It's just Batman
9776520	9778520	I'd rather
9778520	9780520	be playing the Uncharted. But it's goddamn Batman
9780520	9782520	Alright
9782520	9784520	uh anything else you want to talk about that you're
9784520	9786520	doing in the gaming world?
9786520	9788520	Um well I already talked about the
9788520	9790520	Old Republic stuff on Horde House
9790520	9792520	so. Which everybody should listen to. Hordehouse.com
9792520	9794520	it's LulzyWarcraft even if
9794520	9796520	you don't like Warcraft you get to hear dick and fart jokes.
9796520	9798520	Yeah that's terrible
9798520	9800520	um but
9800520	9802520	uh
9802520	9804520	Uncharted 3 like is getting
9804520	9806520	I guess somewhat
9806520	9808520	okay reviews not like oh my god
9808520	9810520	outstanding like the second one
9810520	9812520	and for when I've played of it so far
9812520	9814520	I kind of agree
9814520	9816520	which makes me sad because I am a huge
9816520	9818520	Uncharted fan. I even have an Uncharted
9818520	9820520	3 standee in my basement
9820520	9822520	that I stole from work.
9822520	9824520	Okay I got to know more about this. I forgot Uncharted
9824520	9826520	3 was out this week. Again another freaking game
9826520	9828520	I just don't have time to play.
9828520	9830520	Uncharted 2 was so so so
9830520	9832520	well received and had so many people
9832520	9834520	excited about the third one.
9834520	9836520	Oh yeah. What's the misstep for you?
9836520	9838520	Why are you not feeling it? Is it because maybe it's
9838520	9840520	too much more of the same or is it like did they
9840520	9842520	do a change that doesn't feel right?
9842520	9844520	Well I don't want to give
9844520	9846520	a lot of spoilers away of course
9846520	9848520	because that's mean and I don't
9848520	9850520	I haven't beaten it yet so
9850520	9852520	from what I've played so far which is probably about
9852520	9854520	six hours
9854520	9856520	um it feels like
9856520	9858520	like
9858520	9860520	okay the step from one to
9860520	9862520	two in the series was
9862520	9864520	drastic and amazing.
9864520	9866520	This one feels like they took all the
9866520	9868520	good parts of two and then
9868520	9870520	like the combat is a little
9870520	9872520	bit better if not a little bit harder
9872520	9874520	um the graphics
9874520	9876520	are better but the story
9876520	9878520	just isn't quite
9878520	9880520	there. It seems to be
9880520	9882520	everybody just saying
9882520	9884520	you know hey Nathan Drake why
9884520	9886520	do you chase treasure? You're stupid.
9886520	9888520	Okay so it's not like the
9888520	9890520	story is not nearly as gripping
9890520	9892520	as previously. No not at all.
9892520	9894520	And they're using all these and
9894520	9896520	you know the stories
9896520	9898520	aren't realistic in the least
9898520	9900520	and the first game had like
9900520	9902520	Nazi zombie mutant things
9902520	9904520	and the second game had these
9904520	9906520	Aztec-y big bulky
9906520	9908520	guys that drank some
9908520	9910520	liquid that made them super buff
9910520	9912520	but this one's using like
9912520	9914520	like technology you would see in
9914520	9916520	James Bond and
9916520	9918520	it just isn't doing anything for me.
9918520	9920520	Interesting.
9920520	9922520	Speaking of James Bond didn't those GoldenEye
9922520	9924520	remakes come out too this week? Yeah they
9924520	9926520	did. Oh my god. Yeah. Busy week.
9926520	9928520	And the PS3 one has like a
9928520	9930520	move bundle that looks pretty nice.
9930520	9932520	Interesting. Alright
9932520	9934520	well meekles off I'm gonna let you go. Do you have
9934520	9936520	any other thoughts for listeners before we get more calls?
9936520	9938520	Nope. Alright.
9938520	9940520	Well have fun on vent doing quests.
9940520	9942520	Okay. Good times. Bye.
9942520	9944520	1877 Game OLR or a username
9944520	9946520	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you would
9946520	9948520	like to give us a call.
9948520	9950520	Some folks in chat chat.orangeloungeradio.com
9950520	9952520	actdeft I think he's talking about the
9952520	9954520	Sonic game in our chat room says
9954520	9956520	$30 on Steam. That's not
9956520	9958520	nearly as bad. That's
9958520	9960520	I can check. And I wonder if during the
9960520	9962520	holiday sale it'll be dirt cheap.
9962520	9964520	That's the thing with Steam games. Dirt cheap during the holidays?
9964520	9966520	I'm on it. Yeah I know seriously right?
9966520	9968520	That's where I'm at.
9968520	9970520	1877 Game OLR
9970520	9972520	or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
9972520	9974520	Loki I don't know if you had a minute to
9974520	9976520	look and see if there's anything last minute to talk about
9976520	9978520	to help us fill time here because of our downtime.
9978520	9980520	They relaunched Playstation Home.
9980520	9982520	Oh yeah I forgot that was this week.
9982520	9984520	So it's all fantastic now I guess.
9984520	9986520	I don't know. I haven't logged in.
9986520	9988520	What were they supposed to change?
9988520	9990520	I heard like questing and shit now.
9990520	9992520	It's like all completely redone.
9992520	9994520	I mean it looks like Disneyland almost the way they have it.
9994520	9996520	Don't say words that are going to make me want to
9996520	9998520	download it immediately if it's not that good.
9998520	10000520	It's segmented like a theme park
10000520	10002520	so they've got different sections
10002520	10004520	like you know a midway
10004520	10006520	It's more of a sports center
10006520	10008520	It's more of a Knott's Berry Farm.
10008520	10010520	Yeah.
10010520	10012520	Alright.
10012520	10014520	So that's neat I guess.
10014520	10016520	And then
10016520	10018520	you know the folks that did
10018520	10020520	that wonderful King's Quest
10020520	10022520	The Silver Lining they're actually putting out
10022520	10024520	an original game. Oh yeah
10024520	10026520	I heard about that too. That sounds awesome.
10026520	10028520	Cognition and it's
10028520	10030520	basically an episodic detective
10030520	10032520	adventure about an FBI agent
10032520	10034520	who gains the power to see past events
10034520	10036520	by touching any object.
10038520	10040520	And of course they have a Kickstarter up to
10040520	10042520	fund it and they're looking for $25,000.
10042520	10044520	And you get all sorts
10044520	10046520	of sweet shit if you
10046520	10048520	contribute to that.
10052520	10054520	And then there's a rumor
10054520	10056520	that Mega Man may be coming to
10056520	10058520	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
10058520	10060520	I guess there's a
10060520	10062520	poster in the background of
10062520	10064520	one of the levels that's inspired from
10064520	10066520	an Uncanny X-Men cover
10066520	10068520	and they have Mega Man
10068520	10070520	on there.
10070520	10072520	That was from the
10072520	10074520	not the mutant massacre but the Days of
10074520	10076520	Future Past.
10076520	10078520	And
10078520	10080520	apparently
10080520	10082520	it doesn't show Mega Man as deceased
10082520	10084520	or apprehended so
10084520	10086520	people think
10086520	10088520	maybe download content
10088520	10090520	like that. That'd be a real dick move but
10090520	10092520	hey whatever.
10092520	10094520	They could make some extra money via download
10094520	10096520	content. You know the moment they put them up for
10096520	10098520	download that everyone's gonna get it.
10098520	10100520	It's gonna be instant money maker cause everyone
10100520	10102520	wants Mega Man. And roll.
10104520	10106520	And then last but not least
10106520	10108520	of course we talked
10108520	10110520	a little bit about Nintendo
10110520	10112520	patents earlier and now
10112520	10114520	Sony has actually patented
10114520	10116520	biometric controllers
10116520	10118520	for, well obviously
10118520	10120520	and also for the handhelds as well.
10120520	10122520	And not really sure what this would be used for
10122520	10124520	but kind of think of like
10124520	10126520	maybe
10126520	10128520	some stuff to do with
10128520	10130520	maybe
10130520	10132520	some of the stuff you saw with
10132520	10134520	the vitality sensor
10134520	10136520	or they have the Ubisoft energy thing.
10136520	10138520	Basically reach your
10138520	10140520	blood pressure, heart rate and that kind of
10140520	10142520	stuff. So maybe for exercise programs
10142520	10144520	or something like that they may have a special
10144520	10146520	controller attachment for
10146520	10148520	like a move controller or something like that that
10148520	10150520	would feed into that so you could see
10150520	10152520	if you're exercising at the
10152520	10154520	right level or whatever. I just want to jump in
10154520	10156520	for live listeners. It looks like we're streaming
10156520	10158520	again. Once again we had an internet outage
10158520	10160520	unfortunately. I really appreciate you guys
10160520	10162520	sticking with us through our downtime. Again
10162520	10164520	this is out of our hands.
10164520	10166520	Why would we purposefully cut you guys off?
10166520	10168520	That would be ridiculous.
10168520	10170520	Well trust me. I've been dealing with this for
10170520	10172520	the last three days and it's a pain in the ass.
10172520	10174520	Playing MMO is not fun.
10174520	10176520	Unfortunately we're doing our best through
10176520	10178520	this. We are getting another call though. I guess people can see
10178520	10180520	that we're back up even though I'm still
10180520	10182520	waiting for the chat room to catch up
10182520	10184520	and get us. We are getting calls again.
10184520	10186520	Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
10186520	10188520	Hi this is your friendly
10188520	10190520	neighborhood Mexican. Act Deaf. Hey how you
10190520	10192520	doing Act Deaf? It's good to hear from you.
10192520	10194520	Yeah I'm doing pretty fine
10194520	10196520	I guess. What's up? What's on your mind?
10196520	10198520	First of all
10198520	10200520	I want to talk about
10200520	10202520	something to say about Sonic Generations
10202520	10204520	on PC. I have
10204520	10206520	inflated but it's cheaper
10206520	10208520	on Steam. You know and
10208520	10210520	we mentioned that on the show
10210520	10212520	but of course you guys didn't hear it because of our
10212520	10214520	downtime. But yeah it sounds like it's
10214520	10216520	a more reasonable price on Steam right?
10218520	10220520	Are you still there Act Deaf?
10220520	10222520	Yeah I'm here.
10222520	10224520	Oh okay. It sounds like it's a more reasonable price
10224520	10226520	on Steam then right?
10226520	10228520	Yeah it's like
10228520	10230520	$3 so. So did you buy it?
10230520	10232520	Yeah.
10232520	10234520	Oh what do you think of Sonic
10234520	10236520	Generations?
10236520	10238520	Like I said I haven't played it but
10238520	10240520	many people have talked pretty good about
10240520	10242520	it so I may get it
10242520	10244520	if it's cheaper on
10244520	10246520	Steam's holiday sale.
10246520	10248520	That's kind of
10248520	10250520	where I'm at is that like if it's on Steam
10250520	10252520	then I'm just going to wait for the Uber sale
10252520	10254520	that comes later on and get it then.
10254520	10256520	So we'll
10256520	10258520	see. What else have you been
10258520	10260520	playing lately? What have you been playing
10260520	10262520	if you haven't been playing Sonic Generations?
10262520	10264520	I have been playing
10264520	10266520	Bastion. Oh
10266520	10268520	Bastion's cool. Have you been playing that
10268520	10270520	on the PC or 360 or what?
10270520	10272520	Yeah PC.
10272520	10274520	Right now my 360 is broken
10274520	10276520	so I can't play
10276520	10278520	on it so. But I
10278520	10280520	remember it was they were having like a $5
10280520	10282520	sale on Bastion or
10282520	10284520	something like that this week on Steam.
10284520	10286520	$5 I think. Nice. I got it as a gift.
10286520	10288520	It's a birthday gift. Oh very
10288520	10290520	cool. Well what do you think of Bastion?
10290520	10292520	I haven't played it a lot
10292520	10294520	but I have played
10294520	10296520	it's pretty good. It's pretty
10296520	10298520	addicting. It
10298520	10300520	reminds me of old school Zelda
10300520	10302520	or old school adventure RPGs.
10302520	10304520	What do you
10304520	10306520	think about that narrator
10306520	10308520	that's in the game that has to talk about
10308520	10310520	everything as you're playing through it?
10310520	10312520	I don't know. I liked
10312520	10314520	it. It's a pretty nice addition.
10314520	10316520	It makes you feel like you're
10316520	10318520	playing it with someone
10318520	10320520	and it's
10320520	10322520	telling you the story like
10322520	10324520	no no I liked it. I don't know if
10324520	10326520	anyone hates it or
10326520	10328520	doesn't like it. It definitely is kind of
10328520	10330520	one of those things where you feel like the story is unfolding
10330520	10332520	as you're kind of playing it
10332520	10334520	which is pretty cool.
10334520	10336520	Yeah. But a lot of people
10336520	10338520	say that that's also like the gimmick of the game.
10338520	10340520	That's this big gimmick is that you know
10340520	10342520	without the whole narrator thing it's not
10342520	10344520	really a big deal.
10344520	10346520	Probably.
10346520	10348520	It would be
10348520	10350520	pretty bland I think but yeah
10350520	10352520	the narrator adds something
10352520	10354520	to it that makes it more appealing.
10354520	10356520	And the soundtrack to that game
10356520	10358520	is great too.
10358520	10360520	Yeah I may feature it on the
10360520	10362520	future. I love that song segment.
10362520	10364520	Oh there you go. I love that idea.
10364520	10366520	Hey I got to play this for you. This is a parody that
10366520	10368520	was making it's way around the internet this week. I don't know if you guys
10368520	10370520	saw this but this is the Bastion
10370520	10372520	narrator. Well it's not really him
10372520	10374520	but somebody impersonating him doing his take
10374520	10400520	on other video games.
10405520	10407520	And what's funny is that that's like
10407520	10409520	really what playing the game is like.
10409520	10411520	Yeah.
10411520	10413520	So that's a pretty good parody. I like that. Good job.
10413520	10415520	I'll watch it later.
10415520	10417520	It's really funny.
10417520	10419520	It's on this website called Dorkly.
10419520	10421520	I don't know if they're just hosting the video. No they're awesome.
10421520	10423520	They put out a bunch of weird stuff like that.
10423520	10425520	Nice.
10425520	10427520	Awesome. Well act deaf. Anything else you want to share
10427520	10429520	on the show before we let you go?
10429520	10431520	Probably a question for Loki
10431520	10433520	about
10433520	10435520	the 360s right now.
10435520	10437520	Alright. Loki?
10437520	10439520	Dude
10439520	10441520	is there going to be any special
10441520	10443520	or price deduction for the 360?
10443520	10445520	I want to get one for Christmas.
10445520	10447520	So I don't know if it's going to
10447520	10449520	still be $200 or it's
10449520	10451520	going to get cheaper. They're not going to announce
10451520	10453520	any price drops.
10453520	10455520	You know if anything
10455520	10457520	they just have the holiday bundles
10457520	10459520	right now which you know for like a
10459520	10461520	250 gigabyte system
10461520	10463520	I think they've got Fable 3 and
10463520	10465520	Halo Reach in there.
10465520	10467520	You will see some cutthroat
10467520	10469520	deals going on Black Friday as
10469520	10471520	well like we're already hearing about retailers
10471520	10473520	that are probably going to offer the system
10473520	10475520	and it won't be a price reduction so much
10475520	10477520	but like that you'll get a free $50
10477520	10479520	or even a $100 gift card
10479520	10481520	with the game when you buy this
10481520	10483520	excuse me a $100 gift card when
10483520	10485520	you buy the system and I can't remember what
10485520	10487520	retailer was rumored to be doing that. Was it Toys R Us?
10487520	10489520	Toys R Us says that sometimes.
10489520	10491520	You know keep an eye out for those Black
10491520	10493520	Friday ads because you're probably not going to see
10493520	10495520	a price reduction on the system itself but
10495520	10497520	you'll see these other little deals to try
10497520	10499520	and get you to go buy the system there.
10499520	10501520	And you know when you're talking a $100
10501520	10503520	gift card that could be
10503520	10505520	a pretty big thing. Of course I know
10505520	10507520	you're in Mexico but you
10507520	10509520	come up to California
10509520	10511520	to take advantage of some of those sales
10511520	10513520	sometimes right?
10513520	10515520	Yeah sometimes though
10515520	10517520	I get my bonus until December
10517520	10519520	so you might also
10519520	10521520	be able to take
10521520	10523520	advantage of that. Well it
10523520	10525520	may not be restricted to Black Friday
10525520	10527520	you never know. Sometimes dealers
10527520	10529520	want to kind of keep that movement
10529520	10531520	going through the rest of the year especially
10531520	10533520	retailers like Amazon
10533520	10535520	Best Buy Online
10535520	10537520	Target just you know try to be informed
10537520	10539520	and keep an eye out. This is one of those times
10539520	10541520	I would really recommend a site like CheapAssGamer
10541520	10543520	because they
10543520	10545520	their big niche is
10545520	10547520	rounding up all these ads so
10547520	10549520	keep an eye out when it's time and I'm
10549520	10551520	sure somebody will be offering the deal because they're going to try
10551520	10553520	they're going to try and get them out the
10553520	10555520	door. Yeah I think so.
10555520	10557520	We have a named chatter. I hope that
10557520	10559520	there's a brief
10559520	10561520	go ahead
10561520	10563520	near the hallway
10563520	10565520	so
10565520	10567520	AGM409 in our chatroom says keep
10567520	10569520	a look on at SlickDeals.net
10569520	10571520	suggest that
10571520	10573520	too. So
10573520	10575520	I think we might be losing the internet again
10575520	10577520	we are so unfortunately
10577520	10579520	that brings the ActDeaf call to a close
10579520	10581520	ActDeaf I don't know if you can hear us
10581520	10583520	but thank you so much for your call we really appreciate
10583520	10585520	it
10585520	10587520	Is that it? Did the internet go down completely
10587520	10589520	again? Yes it did. We lost the show
10589520	10591520	again. Again!
10591520	10593520	Sorry! It's not your fault
10593520	10595520	It's just Comcast. It's frustrating
10595520	10597520	but I know it's not your fault. It's because of the rain.
10597520	10599520	It does this every
10599520	10601520	year you know. Right when the rainy
10601520	10603520	season starts and it gets cold
10603520	10605520	It gets cloudy and the cables like
10605520	10607520	ahhhh clouds!
10607520	10609520	It just seems to do this
10609520	10611520	like when it starts getting hot and when it starts getting cold
10611520	10613520	It's irritating
10613520	10615520	but I'm not mad at you. It's redonk
10615520	10617520	I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the situation
10617520	10619520	Alright well any other
10619520	10621520	last minute stories to get out before we wrap it
10621520	10623520	up? Someone's developing
10623520	10625520	a My Little Pony MMO
10625520	10627520	that's disturbing
10627520	10629520	I have a new story
10629520	10631520	Yesterday was my mom's birthday. Happy birthday
10631520	10633520	to my mom. That's not news
10633520	10635520	Hey
10635520	10637520	I love my mommy
10637520	10639520	And then
10639520	10641520	also apparently Gearbox
10641520	10643520	being awesome. There was a
10643520	10645520	guy that was a Borderlands fan
10645520	10647520	who died of cancer
10647520	10649520	at the age of 22 and so
10649520	10651520	Gearbox actually
10651520	10653520	did a eulogy
10653520	10655520	as Claptrap and also
10655520	10657520	this kid will
10657520	10659520	be featured in the next
10659520	10661520	Borderlands game as an NPC
10661520	10663520	which is kind of cool
10663520	10665520	Well that's
10665520	10667520	a nice gesture. That's always
10667520	10669520	really nice to see the companies do that for
10669520	10671520	you know
10671520	10673520	people when they die
10673520	10675520	that were important. Especially if it was really before
10675520	10677520	their time
10677520	10679520	Well I guess is that it for
10679520	10681520	last minute stories?
10681520	10683520	Yeah that's pretty much it
10683520	10685520	Unfortunate. Alright well
10685520	10687520	unfortunately we're missing a Skype line right now
10687520	10689520	I feel really bad especially for those guys
10689520	10691520	that tune up live but again
10691520	10693520	out of our control. Well that's the part of the show
10693520	10695520	where we go around and get everybody's final
10695520	10697520	thoughts and wrap things up
10697520	10699520	so I will say
10699520	10701520	this. I'll start with this of course once again guys
10701520	10703520	thanks for tuning into our show and supporting
10703520	10705520	Orange Launch Radio even when we're having crazy
10705520	10707520	internet downtime and so forth. We really
10707520	10709520	appreciate it. It means a lot to us
10709520	10711520	If you like what you hear all we ask tell a friend about
10711520	10713520	the show. Word of mouth is so important
10713520	10715520	we just want to build our community and grow
10715520	10717520	stronger and maybe
10717520	10719520	find some people that work for the cable company who
10719520	10721520	can make sure our internet connection stays up. Who knows
10721520	10723520	Let's go
10723520	10725520	around and get everybody some final thoughts for the night
10725520	10727520	DarkSakura do you have any final thoughts
10727520	10729520	tonight? We go to print this week
10729520	10731520	I have
10731520	10733520	a seven page research paper due
10733520	10735520	this week
10735520	10737520	Next week
10737520	10739520	I
10739520	10741520	will probably not cry so much
10741520	10743520	I'm about ready to go
10743520	10745520	Loki do you have a final thought tonight?
10745520	10747520	I will be playing Saints Row the
10747520	10749520	third this week at some point
10749520	10751520	That's my goal at least
10751520	10753520	Hopefully sooner rather than later
10753520	10755520	If not I'll play Saints Row 2
10755520	10757520	on PC
10757520	10759520	My final thought tonight is
10759520	10761520	A. I'm really bummed about
10761520	10763520	the internet going down but I guess
10763520	10765520	the one silver lining about it is that
10765520	10767520	means we're going to finish up early just
10767520	10769520	in time for peepers
10769520	10771520	Alright
10771520	10773520	that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio
10773520	10775520	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our
10775520	10777520	show we really appreciate it
10777520	10779520	Did it just come back up?
10779520	10781520	Well we'll come back up in time for folks to hear the credits
10781520	10783520	Have a wonderful night everybody we'll see you next
10783520	10785520	week hopefully with less
10785520	10787520	internet lulls. Good night everyone
