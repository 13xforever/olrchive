61323	65086	Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
65286	65506	Hi.
65927	66527	How are you, Jamie?
66867	67168	Happy.

72592	75414	Joining us in just a few moments is Techmaster Loki.
75614	76995	He's a little late to studio tonight.
77035	80597	I'm literally listening to him walk in right this second.
80737	81818	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
81838	84840	And I'd like to hear a little more about that excuse as to why he's running late.
84860	85841	He's getting situated right now.
85881	86802	We'll come back to him in a minute.
86822	87062	All right.
87242	88103	Saints Row, that's why.
88924	89225	Really?
89525	89765	Really?
89805	91307	You stood this show up for Saints Row?
91928	92689	Are you surprised?
93209	93790	Actually, no.
93890	94331	Not at all.
95717	97278	Well, welcome, Tech Master Loki.
97858	99660	Let me introduce chat while you get situated real quick.
99700	103903	We are, of course, the show where every gamer has a voice, and we always invite your voices via email.
104243	106264	And, like, seriously, we need more voices via email.
106304	106704	Is it true?
106985	107865	No emails tonight?
108306	111508	I think everybody's too busy playing Skyrim and Modern Warfare and all that stuff.
111928	113649	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
114290	116311	The Twitter, of course, Twitter.com slash OLR.
116791	120914	And our chat room, our live chat room, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
120954	121975	Oh, yeah, I forgot to load chat.
122675	123175	Sorry, guys.
143388	144069	Let me give you this.
144209	147311	I went to the mall yesterday and it was a madhouse.
147651	148251	Absolute mad.
148271	152394	Like I would have thought yesterday was like the weekend after Thanksgiving.
152595	153435	It was that crowded.
153815	162041	So maybe that's a good sign that the economy is coming back or maybe people just want to get out and get their shopping done before all the craziness hits.
162441	162742	I don't know.
163762	166204	This is why I don't go to the mall at all this time of year.
167184	169866	I can't say I blame you, but that's where my haircut place is.
169906	172587	So I had to go over there and just there was other errands I wanted to do.
172687	173608	So what can you do?
174130	176471	All right.
177211	179472	Let's also introduce the chat room.
179792	181793	We're going to get to the Skype calls a little later on.
182253	182913	Let me talk about this.
182953	188875	Speaking of deals, I wanted to start off with a discussion on this real quick, and that is the Black Friday stuff that's starting to hit the Internet.
189095	193597	And if you don't know what Black Friday is, I don't know what hole you've been living in, but maybe you don't live in the U.S.
193637	194217	That could be it, too.
194617	197839	Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving here in the U.S.
198279	203362	And it's usually a day that's kind of the official, unofficial, official kickoff to the holiday shopping season.
203922	206423	And things get discounted like crazy.
207124	211646	And some of the Black Friday ads are starting to leak out there on the Internet.
211666	215968	And you kind of have to take a lot of what you read on the Internet with a grain of salt.
216469	222892	But a website that's very respected and reputable within the gaming community, CheapAssGamer, at CheapAssGamer.com,
223152	223793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
243126	272764	The 4 gig console That's very inexpensive Considering that guy is usually about $199 That's a very deep discount Playstation 3 Seems to be $199 most places Probably the cheapest place is Walmart By a whole two cents But Best Buy and Radio Shack are deeply discounting that as well The Wii is down to $100 3DS going down to $179.99 That's a bundle Pack going on there I was going to say because that's not a discount at all Right but it's a bundle pack with a game
273984	294631	And let's see, discounts on games Current games, Batman Arkham City, gonna be $28 at Walmart, $29 at Best Buy Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, it's still $60 but you can get a $10 gift card at Target Gears of War 3 for $28 at Walmart Need for Speed, The Run, $30 at Best Buy
295791	297552	Some pretty good deals throughout there.
298393	301976	And again, that list I was reading from is just cheapassgamer.com.
301996	304118	They have a little compilation going on there.
304838	306860	That's their specialty is looking at game deals.
308581	312905	But I wanted to kind of ask the folks in the studio here, do you get excited about Black Friday?
312965	315487	Is that something you think you might participate in for some of these deals?
315507	318089	Or are you like, hell no, get me the hell away from those stores?
318509	318949	No.
319470	319610	No?
319890	321211	I don't have anything I don't already want.
321231	322352	Okay.
322552	324033	So if you want something, you just go get it.
324334	328758	Having gone out to stores on Black Friday before, no, I'll be staying inside and playing Saints Row.
329078	332621	I mean, really, I can get just as good deals online.
334223	336665	And, you know, I know people who are going.
337126	337306	Yeah.
337586	341329	So if they're going to be there anyway, I just say, okay, you do this for me.
341650	342911	It's all about Cyber Monday.
342971	344272	Cyber Monday, I don't have to go anywhere.
344412	346234	I just sit down and deals come to me.
346414	346874	That's true.
347275	348896	I'm a little more into the Cyber Monday.
349136	353099	I have never gone out on Black Friday, but some of these deals, I don't know, they have me thinking.
353119	354119	There's some good game prices.
354139	356701	Well, you know who doesn't like Steam?
356721	357402	I'm looking forward to Steam.
357422	358703	Yeah, I was going to say Cyber Monday.
359183	360524	That's a big Steam thing right there.
361124	361525	Oh, yeah.
362405	364487	Hat day is going to hurt on Steam, that's for sure.
365748	366008	Anyway.
366308	373213	I mean, really, the only things that I could possibly want slash need is I'd like a new laptop.
373693	374274	That's about it.
375154	377735	I would like for my current computer to not be a piece of shit.
378355	381756	Which it won't be once I put Windows 7 and Linux Mint on it.
382516	383496	Because that's coming soon.
385077	388458	You told me the other day you were still running Vista and I was like, oh, poor thing.
388478	390098	Because I've had problems going on.
390518	395319	But I mean, right now, honestly, given my situation, I'm just lucky to have a roof over my head.
396140	397400	I'm happy to have food to eat.
398520	399661	I'm happy to have stuff to wear.
401302	403769	So quite honestly... You're being very zen about the whole thing.
403789	407500	You're just very like, you know, I don't need material possessions anymore.
408504	410705	Well, it's not really so much of a that.
411005	418747	It's just that having been slapped in the face with the possibility of maybe being homeless or having nothing to eat.
418987	420308	You're not going to be homeless.
420348	427150	But it sort of realigned my values, I guess, my perspective.
427390	427870	I gotcha.
428290	436573	I used to really dread turning 30, but then when I was really sick in 2008, which you guys might remember, I was like, hey, turning 30 is awesome because I actually lived to be 30.
437709	439770	Life is actually better once you're 30, too.
440270	440810	It really is.
440910	442511	But anyway, that's for another.
442991	445272	That's for the Zen show, which will be our third podcast.
445332	452914	But I mean, seriously, it's just sort of like, you know, if I want these games, I can rent them if I really want to play it.
453594	457536	You know, I've got tons of games that I've, you know, hardly played.
457656	463958	I just started Project Diva, which is fun.
464358	466179	Well, we'll get into that in a minute during Gaming Weeks.
466199	469321	But let me go to some of the comments from our chat room at chat.orangelantradio.com.
469841	473143	HitStun says, I get roughly half my Christmas shopping done on Black Friday.
473783	475944	SalaciousPop says, fuck the mall, seriously.
476444	477405	Maybe Fry's.
477485	479406	It's the only in-real-life store I'd go to.
479666	480867	That's the worst.
481087	482848	Do not go to Fry's on Black Friday.
483428	491812	If you want to go to Fry's and watch the guy walking around with a balloon that says, line ends here, and then you watch it snake through the entire store.
491892	495694	Yeah, I did that one time because I think I was actually living with you at the time.
495754	496234	Yeah, I think you were.
496254	500116	And I was buying a replacement motherboard or something because my computer had died.
501477	505341	and that line took like an hour and a half to go through not again
525799	530263	Let's see, Actdeft says, I got my Dreamcast for $50 on a Black Friday sale.
530503	531123	That's pretty awesome.
531624	534827	GameGuru says, I got my 360 on a Black Friday a few years back.
535607	538210	Eric K. says, I Black Friday on Amazon.
538790	541192	And Amiga777 says, what's a fries?
541693	542834	That's right, they don't have them everywhere.
543359	546302	Think like a Best Buy that's like three times as big.
546622	547843	That's kind of what a Fry's is.
547923	551286	It sells, you know, a lot of electronic and appliances and all that.
551306	552547	That's pretty much what a Fry's is, right?
553187	554509	So a lot of good deals.
554689	556951	They sell a lot more components than a Best Buy does.
556971	558492	And really crappy toys that you don't need.
560453	562354	and food, like nerd food.
562734	563814	That's the other weird thing.
563894	565135	Astronaut ice cream!
565175	566735	Best Buy does kind of have that though.
566755	569216	They have like the movie food at their counter, so whatever.
569356	569596	Anyway.
570116	571716	Alright, that's comments from our chat room.
571736	586041	The fries, not only can you get your games and stuff like that, you can get stuff to outfit a convenience store, including a cotton candy maker, a hot dog cooker, and all sorts of things.
586061	587141	Yeah, just random stuff.
587641	590503	Not that I've ever bought any of that shit at Fry's, but... I've thought about it.
590523	592845	Did you get your deep fryer at Fry's?
593365	594446	No, that was a Christmas gift.
594466	596327	Oh, that's right, that's right.
596367	598228	I want another one, but the wife won't let me.
598629	604453	All right, anyhow, we're going to go on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
604973	605934	We'll start off with Dark Sakura.
605954	607034	I know you mentioned Project D.Va.
607515	613839	Yeah, I had started it and then remembered that I had to write a research paper, so I turned it off.
613919	615160	I'm trying to actually find the...
618174	622157	Charger for our PSP so that I can take it with me to school.
623298	624960	But it's cute, very pretty.
625860	627602	And I played some WoW.
627802	630904	I'm almost level 60 on Gyaru.
632486	633907	That's the one in the Horde House Guild, right?
633927	634988	Yeah, the one in the Horde House Guild.
635148	635588	Good times.
635648	637190	I'm really enjoying Priest.
637230	638651	I never thought I would really like it.
638942	639262	DarkSakura.com
654170	654570	DarkSakura.com
674062	676204	But you need to come back and we need to do Pally Pals.
676584	677925	Yeah, we were having fun with it for a while.
677945	680727	Rob and I have paladins that look oddly related.
680747	682188	I have a paladin named Diabetes.
683188	687471	Mine's named Sylviara, but I actually tried to make a decent name.
688892	690533	I could have named her Cotton Candy.
691013	696717	I decided since they weren't going to give me the walrus people so I could have a walrus named Diabetes, I guess I'll just have a paladin.
697318	703542	I made you a Tuskar in the model viewer named Wilford.
704922	706003	I made it in honor of you.
706423	706703	Nice.
707163	709664	I'm laughing at the salacious pop in our chat room.
710024	712464	It says, Rob is going to come home with a churro machine now.
712744	713985	Do they sell those at Fry's?
714005	715965	Because if so, that's on my holiday list.
716005	716886	You know, I don't know.
717166	719166	But I'm serious.
719186	720106	You go over there.
721187	724288	It's part of the appliance section, at least in our local one over here in Roseville.
724308	725448	I want a goddamn churro machine.
725488	726848	Do you know how popular I'd be?
727228	729269	I'd be like having Disneyland in my house.
729909	731870	I live in the cat bathroom, so I could always have.
732130	733350	If they have a slurping machine there.
736007	737147	I will have a slurping machine.
737308	737648	Anyway, sorry.
737668	738788	I know what I'm getting you, Rob.
739408	739849	Sorry, DarkSakura.
739869	742169	It's more of a gift for Salacious Pop.
743310	744590	Why would you get me a gift for him?
744610	745651	Because you'll benefit from it.
746031	746331	Okay.
746891	747292	Oh, I see.
747352	749873	It's something where it's like it'll keep him busy so I can do what I want?
750133	750273	No.
750593	750833	Okay.
751553	751793	All right.
752193	755115	Anyhow, back to games you've been playing.
755155	755795	Wow and so forth.
756435	759697	Um, I really haven't had a whole lot of time for games.
759757	764381	As I said last week, we had to finish compiling the magazine this week.
764461	765962	So most of my time has been spent at school.
767763	772866	So I did like a little bit of flash gaming and rearranged my entire portable hard drive.
774788	780752	Because I was hanging out with the art director while he was finishing the compiling and I had to do last minute corrections and stuff.
781612	804475	that's all done hopefully we go to print I think tomorrow or Tuesday so now that that's done my research paper is ready I'm expecting everyone to buy an issue seriously you'll have my eternal gratitude if you buy an issue of the American River Review and can see all my gorgeous work that's okay I have enough issues already you've got subscriptions what are you talking about
806522	807583	I'm running low on toilet paper.
807603	809124	But Dan finished Arkham City.
809865	810165	Oh yeah?
810606	811587	He finished all the missions.
811907	812148	Nice.
812708	815011	Has he found every Riddler trophy?
815191	815691	I doubt it.
816152	817934	He has found enough to find Riddler.
818474	818815	Nice.
819135	822358	So he beat Riddler, which is kind of a letdown.
823039	823339	Really?
823560	824340	I mean, it's funny.
825041	826523	I have to say Riddler sets off my gaydar.
828226	832630	Riddler is kind of, like, this is going to sound really weird, but Riddler's kind of hot.
832790	834972	Like, it depends on which Riddler we're talking about.
835072	843920	But this Riddler is like... Not so much like Frank Gorshin, Riddler from 60s Batman, but I'm talking like when they tried to make Riddler very metrosexual.
843960	847904	Yeah, I was going to say metro, but he sets off, but he actually does set off my gaydar.
848044	848324	All right.
848705	853389	This is the first time I've ever had a character in a game set off my infallible gaydar.
854116	855598	It's the greatest question of all.
856219	857780	Yeah.
858301	862646	And then Dan did the whole thing with Catwoman when you go back to help Batman.
863207	864729	Instead, he did the thing where she leaves him.
865914	869297	I don't know that part yet, so you better not be spoiling or I'll come over there and kick your butt.
869317	869897	It's just funny.
869957	872119	You should do it at least once because you can go back and fix it.
873500	876502	I hear story mode is actually not that long, all things considered.
876702	881606	No, the primary missions are really not that long, but there's so much else to do.
881626	882807	Yeah, Grand Theft Batman.
883587	885589	The hush ones are really cool.
885769	885909	Hmm.
886109	887330	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
904093	905454	Do you know why I love Batman?
905554	911176	And it's not... I'm actually not a big comic reader, although, I don't know, like... I'm sitting here reading a comic right now.
911196	920420	Well, funny enough, Salacious Pop bought... We went to a brand new comic book store out in Natomas, like some brand new place that just opened up like a month ago, and he bought The Killing Joke.
920901	922181	The Killing Joke is very good.
922461	924622	And so I was thinking I might steal that and read it.
925062	927383	Because I don't usually... I'm not like a comic book reader.
927403	929985	It's not that I dislike them, I just... It's a fucked up story.
930145	930665	Yeah, I know, I know.
931385	941910	The reason why I love Batman so much is not just the movies, which were brilliant, but seriously, growing up, I think I saw every single episode of the old Batman series from the 60s with Adam West.
942230	946132	No, I did not grow up in the 60s, but they re-ran them all the time.
946152	947532	But Julie Newmar was my hero.
948052	948553	She's great.
949273	951554	It's really sad that they don't re-run them now.
952294	953236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
970057	974000	There's a few characters in there that I know they're Batman characters, but I don't know who they are.
974120	978683	I knew Solomon Grundy was a Batman character, but I had no idea who exactly he was.
979484	981205	For me, I love the art in the game.
981865	985708	So I've just been sitting there watching him because I'm looking at the scenery.
986889	992733	And for me, my favorite place is when they go, I don't know if you've been there yet, but the Wonder City underground.
993874	994714	The sunken streets.
994814	996796	I've been in a subway system underground.
997016	997116	Yeah.
997376	1004241	Under the subway, closer to where Wonder Tower is, you can go underground and it's like this World's Fair exhibition.
1004861	1010105	But it's all these city streets, like little, you know, with buggies and everything, only it's all torn up.
1010565	1012627	But a lot of the artwork in there is very Art Nouveau.
1013553	1020239	I'm up to the, just to give you an idea where I'm at in the story, keep in mind I have done some of the side quests, like some of the Zaz stuff, which that guy's scary.
1020479	1022962	But, okay, was it just me or does his voice sound like a woman at first?
1024143	1026565	He just sounds like he has a problem.
1026785	1027986	He sounded like a woman.
1028026	1029167	You want to give him a hug, but you don't.
1029187	1031669	I'll carve your name into my skin.
1031749	1034031	He puts the notion in the basket.
1034512	1037855	The chat room is reminding us that they do rerun him on the hub.
1038693	1039474	Okay, The Hub.
1039674	1040214	Is that really?
1040354	1040574	Okay.
1040594	1042115	There you go.
1042155	1045037	But anyway, I was going to say, I am at the point in the game, I'm in the museum.
1045998	1047439	As your hunting penguin.
1047819	1048320	Sort of.
1048620	1054584	We just kicked some of his henchman's ass, and then we were at this part with boats, and you're having to use the grappling hook.
1054624	1055304	That's annoying.
1055484	1056285	Oh my god.
1056865	1057746	I was so frustrated.
1057766	1059407	Do you know how many times I've been eaten by a shark?
1059787	1062629	And you know how many more times you're going to have to do shit like that in the game?
1063410	1063650	Ugh.
1064811	1066111	Wait till you get... Otherwise, I love it.
1066191	1067292	Wait till you get the cryobomb.
1068793	1069053	All right.
1069913	1071594	Because you... Can't wait.
1071674	1072934	You throw it in the water.
1073955	1075095	Or else it gets the hose again.
1075235	1075875	You know what, though?
1075895	1077096	You want to know what's really annoying?
1077156	1078856	Is going and trying to do all that shit with Catwoman.
1080016	1081817	But keep in mind, she can climb on the ceiling.
1081937	1083838	Dude, the Catwoman parts are my favorite so far.
1083858	1084938	I love her whip!
1085178	1086038	Her and Poison Ivy.
1086438	1087579	She's so much fun to battle with.
1087919	1088719	Anyway, sorry.
1089119	1091140	That's, that's, that's hotness.
1091460	1092161	Or poison, I mean.
1092201	1093081	She is, she is pretty hot.
1093282	1097744	In fact, I think in the chat room, Tigerclaw asked, hotter than Catwoman, I think in reference to my Riddler reference.
1098384	1103367	Oh, I mean, it kind of depends on what you're into, but, you know, I'm very secure in my homosexuality when I say this.
1103427	1104948	Catwoman has a nice rack.
1106389	1107930	It's, it's the, uh, She's hot.
1108070	1109811	the new style Catwoman, too.
1110211	1111512	So she's probably fucking Batman.
1111712	1116675	You just, like, any minute, that, that zipper's just gonna fly open and go, woohoo!
1116975	1117455	You know?
1117836	1118056	Yeah.
1119278	1123380	So yeah, so while I haven't been playing it, I've really been getting into it.
1124361	1130004	Just like I said, for me, it's going around and looking at everything and really taking in the scenery.
1130224	1133766	And Dan will actually just stop and go exploring places for me so I can see it.
1133886	1134386	Oh, that's fun.
1134546	1135166	This is pretty cool.
1135426	1139869	The other night I was playing with a group of friends and they were like, go in the place that says live nude girls.
1140109	1141489	There's a place that says live nude girls.
1141529	1141910	Go in the door.
1141930	1142410	There's two signs.
1142450	1143090	Live nude girls.
1143230	1143450	Yeah.
1144131	1144971	I think you can go in there.
1144991	1145832	Yeah, the door was locked.
1146552	1147993	I'm assuming maybe it comes into play later.
1149413	1150754	No, it really... Oh, really?
1150934	1153215	I assumed it was a Riddler Room that came up later or something.
1153795	1158837	Some of those... Of course, based on our speculation, Riddler Room wouldn't be at Live Noob Girls.
1159438	1160018	Yeah, yeah.
1160658	1163999	Oh, his little hideout, by the way, is fucking sadistic.
1164740	1165180	I love it.
1166060	1169422	So, but yeah... Dude, Tigerclaw says, you know you can punch the shark?
1169702	1170002	Really?
1170022	1170142	Really?
1171553	1172694	I'm gonna do that next time.
1172974	1174755	I'm gonna tell Dan to go punch the shark.
1175035	1176476	I'm gonna shoot him in the face with the electric gun.
1176496	1178358	You bet you cannot jump it.
1178378	1178858	Alright, anyhow.
1179719	1180759	We need to move on, sorry.
1181580	1184402	So really, that's been what my gaming week has been.
1185563	1192888	I'm planning on, now that I've got my research paper done, I've got like one more paper that I've got to do with my group, but we have to pick a piece of art.
1193648	1194729	So we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
1196397	1196757	Good times.
1196777	1201722	Because half the group's into modern movies and stuff.
1201742	1202682	And he said, we could do a movie.
1202742	1203943	So I was like, we're going to do Rocky shit.
1204784	1206405	So they were coming over Tuesday to do the time warp.
1207066	1207466	Good times.
1208127	1211830	And so when that's all done, I'm going to play the shit out of Project Diva.
1213912	1214232	All right.
1214612	1215133	Hell yeah.
1216414	1217135	All right, Loki.
1217635	1219336	Need I ask, how was your gaming week?
1220718	1221478	Very fulfilling.
1221498	1224401	I'm not playing a lot of things this week, actually.
1225886	1227788	Grand Theft Auto Modern Warfare
1245868	1246968	No, it doesn't have multiplayer in it.
1247548	1248529	No deathmatch in it.
1249029	1249189	Oh.
1249949	1250289	Really?
1250469	1251809	It has co-op, but not deathmatch?
1251869	1252049	Yes.
1252229	1252670	Oh, okay.
1252690	1254330	So wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
1254730	1257351	So now you're all about Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
1257451	1257951	Like three?
1258291	1258711	The new one?
1259111	1259251	No.
1259891	1259991	One.
1261011	1263392	Well, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
1263552	1263952	Oh, okay.
1264592	1265672	So, that one.
1265752	1266353	Because it's cheap.
1266793	1268073	You have to buy five copies.
1268733	1297316	I see, so you're starting with the one you could get for $9.99 these days Exactly, so that's what we're playing And the only reason that they're switching to it is because they got tired of me beating them And I'm happy to report that our first game that we played on it I nearly, well I doubled second place's scores So I'm still going to beat them in this game So I don't know what the point was in switching, but whatever They wanted to mix it up I have an important news flash What?
1297356	1298037	Dan brought me pizza
1299508	1300468	Did he bring me pizza?
1300509	1301029	You can get some.
1301089	1301649	I'm just kidding.
1301689	1302029	I'll wait.
1303430	1305111	And then other than that, let's see.
1305211	1311914	I played Zelda the Four Swords Adventure on the 3DS or DS, I guess.
1312114	1313715	It's off the store.
1315195	1315696	It's all right.
1316176	1321058	I think definitely more of a game for more than one person and not too fun playing it by yourself.
1321818	1324059	And I don't know.
1324380	1324720	It's all right.
1325040	1327261	But yeah, definitely more fun with more people.
1328340	1331324	And then, yeah, yeah, yeah, I played Saints Row the Third, which is just amazing.
1332745	1337951	I'm actually about 13 hours into it already, and it's just great.
1338111	1343698	It's every bit of awesome that I wanted it to be it is, and then some.
1344058	1346581	There's got to be something negative, something you're not happy about.
1348290	1353393	The escort missions are still annoying because the AI is still kind of eh.
1353533	1366839	It's a little bit glitchy now and then, but not anything that really hurts the game, just like funny stuff like I'll finish a tank mission or something and when I'm done there's corpses stuck in the ground and so you can walk up to them and they kind of like bounce around back and forth and stuff.
1367200	1371562	It's the same shit that's funny in Skyrim, like mammoths just randomly falling from the sky and all that.
1371702	1371842	Yeah.
1372122	1373722	Just random stuff, and that's fine.
1374623	1378563	I expect that game to be slightly buggy, because that's how Saints Row is.
1378663	1380944	It's just slightly buggy, and it's fine.
1381224	1382604	It makes it more funny.
1383744	1386105	I gotta say, though, the missions are great.
1386645	1388305	Just what I've played so far.
1389186	1392886	They have some really good direction to them, and...
1396187	1402129	There's even some that have, like, kind of music that plays along with it that's just really awesome.
1402169	1403930	It just sets the mood so well.
1404050	1407511	How does the game... Like, you know, keep in mind, I haven't played a lot of the Saints Row games.
1407551	1410392	I played the first one for, like, an hour, tops.
1410772	1414894	But, like, how does it transition from all these bits of randomness one to another?
1414934	1416715	Because isn't it a very open-world game?
1417155	1422497	And, like, when I started seeing all this stuff, like, that there's Tron parodies in it and all these things, I was like, how do they...
1423337	1425039	How do they work that all into the game?
1425519	1427161	How does it go from one parody to another?
1428382	1429523	It works really well, actually.
1429864	1443017	And like the very beginning, the first few missions, actually quite a bit of the missions, I think I was up through 20% of the game and it was still doing tutorial missions, I guess, to kind of introduce you to the different activities that you can do in the game.
1444694	1448276	And, you know, it's really strange sometimes.
1448316	1460200	Like, for example, there's one that you're being trained by this one saint that you pick up who's voiced by Hulk Hogan.
1460861	1471205	And he's training you to be able to confront Kilbane, who's this luchador, the leader of the luchador gang or whatever in there and stuff.
1471245	1471545	And so...
1472385	1474746	It's almost like a little bit of Karate Kid, sort of.
1475306	1481969	And it's great because one of the songs in the game is The Best from Karate Kid.
1482070	1486131	You're the best around.
1486251	1486892	Yes, exactly.
1487232	1491974	And they actually have that in the part when you first talk to the guy and stuff.
1492514	1494115	So he's having you feel pain.
1494155	1497737	So one of the missions that you do, it's basically an activity.
1497857	1500898	So there's lots of pop culture references left and right, essentially.
1500918	1500998	Yeah.
1501879	1504382	It's not all pop culture references.
1504442	1506444	It's just really over the top.
1507805	1509607	Just very big action sequences.
1509667	1511549	How many people have you slapped in the face with a dildo?
1512270	1512690	I don't know.
1513791	1515453	But I think it keeps the stats for that.
1516554	1517455	You lost count.
1518456	1519036	I mean, come on.
1519277	1521178	This game has... How many whores have you killed?
1522339	1522780	I don't know.
1522860	1524081	I don't think I've killed that many whores.
1524101	1526503	There aren't that many... There's some strange shit, okay?
1526623	1533408	Like, seriously, you'll be walking around, all of a sudden, you know, there's gimps walking around, and then these furries walking around.
1533489	1534850	It's like, what the hell is going on?
1535350	1535710	Today...
1536511	1537832	And I think this is an easter egg.
1537852	1543918	Today, I ran across, you know, Genki, the cat head guy that's running this Japanese game show or whatever.
1544559	1546301	The mascot for this game, almost.
1547121	1551526	All of a sudden, I see him running around the street shooting people with rocket launchers.
1551546	1551766	I'm like,
1553251	1553891	What are you doing out here?
1554472	1560617	And so I went to go try to kill him, and I did manage to kill him finally, but it took a lot.
1560677	1566581	I think it glitched him underneath a dump truck or something, and that crushed him to death.
1567142	1571305	Kaijudo in our chatroom is asking, Loki, did they fix the camera and the driving in Saints 3?
1571385	1574988	The bad camera and the bad driving killed Saints 2 for me.
1575008	1576449	Again, that's chat.orange.com.
1576509	1577750	Yes, they fixed the driving.
1577790	1578771	The driving is awesome.
1579131	1582113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1604224	1606585	No, it's just a horde mode.
1606665	1608285	Some waves have whores in them.
1608806	1611366	Some of them, you're shrunken down really small.
1611446	1612607	Some of them, you're really big.
1613287	1614307	Just ridiculous stuff.
1616028	1618309	I'm trying to think of some really strange stuff.
1618449	1623570	Oh, I have a gun now that I can fire at a car that allows me to control it like an RC car, which is kind of fun.
1625191	1626031	That sounds like Driver.
1627012	1630693	You have parachutes that you can use whenever, so you can just skydive off a building and...
1632774	1634534	I should have wingsuits.
1635295	1636995	They don't have any wingsuits, unfortunately.
1637055	1637776	Are you having a lot of fun?
1638216	1640317	It sounds to me like you're just able to sandbox.
1641397	1641777	It's great.
1641897	1643958	It's seriously a fun game.
1643978	1651001	I'm going to be playing it probably during the show.
1651681	1652061	A little bit.
1653943	1655304	Anything else to say on Saints Row for now?
1656545	1657225	Definitely pick it up.
1657365	1658206	It's a great game.
1658526	1659407	I mean, it's worth it.
1659847	1664931	And I've seen some of the reviewers bitching about how the missions were very linear.
1665792	1667193	Dude, it's a mission.
1667213	1668094	It's supposed to be linear.
1668414	1671096	I don't understand what they're looking for.
1671216	1673138	There's just so many games out right now.
1673158	1674859	I can't pick up Saints Row right now.
1674879	1675660	There's too much.
1675900	1676641	Too much!
1677441	1677742	Alright.
1678382	1680943	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1703027	1706948	One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, I'm sure will come as no surprise to anyone, Skyrim.
1707268	1710809	I picked up on Friday, had it delivered on release day.
1710829	1713290	I've been playing Skyrim quite a bit since Friday.
1713810	1721853	And it's very similar to Oblivion where you can, once you do the very first quest in the beginning, you can pretty much go out in the world and do whatever you want.
1722233	1725174	And I think that openness really turns some people off.
1725874	1727895	And I was really giving this some thought earlier today.
1727915	1736199	It's really funny because we consider Oblivion a role-playing game, and we consider the Final Fantasy series a role-playing game, when in reality, the two could not be any more different.
1736579	1738780	Those games are so, so different.
1738980	1740381	I mean, seriously, put them side by side.
1740881	1744403	Final Fantasy XIII, criticized by many for being too linear.
1744923	1745643	I disagree.
1745723	1748725	I think that was kind of a big part of Final Fantasy XIII.
1748845	1750365	It was very, very story-driven.
1751106	1751186	Um...
1752146	1754529	Skyrim, not linear whatsoever.
1754669	1759654	I mean, yes, there's a main quest, but there's about an eleventy billion other things you can do outside that main quest.
1759694	1763518	In fact, now there's this whole, it randomly generates quests.
1763718	1764379	So it's like Fable?
1764639	1765420	It's crazy.
1765500	1766581	No, it's better than Fable.
1766641	1766901	I'm sorry.
1766921	1770785	I meant like though in terms of its exploration.
1770805	1771486	Yeah.
1771946	1777610	I guess, yeah, because like some of the more recent Fable games, you kind of go around and do whatever, but it's just even on a bigger scale.
1778070	1784395	It's just I love the fact that in Skyrim, you know, and they've been saying this a lot, you look at the top of a mountain, you can climb that mountain.
1785215	1788217	And anywhere you look at from the top of that mountain, you can walk to.
1788437	1789918	It might take you a while to get there, but you can do it.
1790119	1793081	There might be some mammoths and giants in your way not wanting you to get there, but you can do it.
1794061	1799005	And just so many randomly generated things that just kind of like make you look away.
1799025	1799105	Yeah.
1799645	1817571	and I think in that sense you know again to compare with Final Fantasy 13 there sometimes is a bit of a grind to it there's numbers you want to out level and you know there is a lot of fun I love Final Fantasy I'm not dogging that at all in fact I think Final Fantasy 13 was really underrated by a lot of the gaming media I think it's a great game
1818451	1845139	but Skyrim is just so different but you can't approach Skyrim like you do a Final Fantasy game or you're setting yourself up for trouble and that can be really hard because there's a lot of people that's like I gotta do and I gotta see everything in the game and I gotta not screw this up because I wanna get the perfect ending and it's like you can't have that in a game that is randomly generating quests if you can't put that aside you're gonna be in trouble I saw some pretty funny videos for Skyrim
1845339	1849903	Because, you know, one of my favorite things about games is how they're slightly buggy.
1850163	1852105	And Oblivion was slightly buggy and it was great.
1852645	1856068	But I don't know if you've seen the video where you put a pot on someone's head.
1856468	1856969	Yes, yes.
1857009	1857729	That's hilarious.
1857889	1859371	And then they suddenly can't see.
1859451	1859971	That's great.
1862213	1865256	Which is funny because in that video, I recognized it.
1865316	1867579	I was like, oh, I did that guy's quest.
1867659	1873925	By the way, spoiler, if you do his quest to get the Dragon Claw, you will actually complete a story quest ahead of time.
1874125	1875186	Just throwing it out there.
1875807	1876568	Pro tip from me.
1878270	1880412	But anyway, it's a great game.
1880572	1881633	It's gorgeous to look at.
1883334	1884514	It's fun.
1885015	1886155	You just log in.
1886195	1887435	You can do whatever you want.
1888736	1896077	There's so much to do, so much to explore, that sense of gratification, so many ways to develop your character.
1896137	1897338	You don't pick a class anymore.
1897378	1900038	You're not a wizard or a warrior or anything.
1900078	1902999	It's just if you happen to use swords a lot, you skill up in swords.
1903319	1906560	If you happen to stealth around a lot, you level up in sneaking.
1906940	1907900	That's awesome.
1907980	1910281	It builds the character as you play it, which is great.
1910381	1913021	And then the constellation talent tree system is great, too.
1913041	1915022	So you can effectively make a battle mage.
1915562	1917982	Yeah, that's actually what I'm playing right now, pretty much.
1918443	1919243	Yeah, it's pretty fun.
1920903	1933846	Some of the very minor drawbacks I can think of, and there are still some surprising bugs in the game, despite how polished it's supposed to be after five years of development, some very obvious bugs.
1934526	1940127	Let me tell you, I'm going to say the most nitpicky, crazy thing about a game, like ever.
1940287	1942847	But this seriously is something that I find a little odd.
1943548	1946848	And believe it or not, this is something that's going to appeal to DarkSakura.
1948168	1949069	It's the design.
1950089	1951089	The menu design.
1951249	1954549	And this is going to be really nerdy, like the nerdiest thing you're ever going to hear in a game review.
1955150	1963671	I find the usage of a narrow sans-serif font to be very strange and conflicting to the ambience of what these games are supposed to be about.
1966832	1968453	I am dead fucking serious.
1991070	1994352	You know, for that type of game, I really would agree with you.
1995032	2005577	Except that the thinner, the light styles of Sans Serif's always make me think of a little bit of an ethereal quality.
2006998	2012901	But I would have think that it should have been something a little bit more on the script side.
2013041	2016743	It's also that it's the same font everywhere too, which is a little weird.
2016963	2017704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2037164	2043728	But, like, well, I don't know what the font is in Skyrim, but it's like an Ariel Nero, and it's like, you know, there's only so much of that I can take.
2043888	2044769	You know what Ariel is?
2045069	2045269	What?
2045729	2046610	Poor man's Helvetica.
2046630	2047391	All right, anyway.
2047791	2051193	Well, no, for serious, because Microsoft made that because they didn't want to pay for Helvetica.
2051413	2051693	The end.
2052494	2052954	It's the truth.
2054675	2056937	At least it's not, like, set in fucking Comic Sans or something.
2057297	2058238	That's true, that's true.
2058518	2061020	Or Papyrus is another gag me font.
2061420	2062100	I know, I know.
2062461	2062681	But...
2064955	2074283	It seemed, the look of it made me think that it was a placeholder text and that they just didn't change it.
2075864	2079848	Honestly, this is the most extreme nitpicky thing I have ever talked about in a video game.
2080028	2085532	The game is fantastic and do not let my bitching about the font deter your opinion.
2086013	2090436	I don't really care for the high renders of everything in the menu.
2090456	2091077	Yeah.
2091697	2095720	If someone's running it on a PC, that's going to slow down their time.
2095780	2097682	I hear it runs pretty decent on most PCs.
2098823	2103506	The other thing I did think was weird was that I didn't like how there was two different menus.
2103526	2111592	There's one menu to bring up your quest log and stuff, but then there's another button you have to hit if you want your map or spells or the constellation.
2112273	2114614	I kind of wish that had all been integrated into one menu.
2114654	2116396	I thought that was kind of just odd.
2116476	2117857	It felt really weird to play.
2118277	2120078	and I'm not sure why it was designed that way.
2120378	2125079	I didn't like having two menus because I keep thinking that the map is in the start key and it's not.
2125159	2126900	It's in the O or the circle.
2127220	2128540	So it's just weird.
2130321	2134302	To answer, I wonder who protested the Ikea font change.
2135543	2135923	I did.
2136483	2139444	Ikea always needs to use Futura forever.
2140704	2142425	This is Typography Lounge Radio.
2142805	2143085	Alright.
2143706	2148391	Look, the game is fantastic, but it is a different type of roleplaying game.
2148651	2149712	It's not for everybody.
2150132	2151434	But if you just...
2153729	2176183	in some ways it's like an MMO where you don't have to deal with other people at all it has that open world sense to it and there's so much that you can interact with and do and the whole like quest forever type of thing almost feels like an MMO but without everything that people hate about MMOs which is other people usually so and a monthly fee so but Skyrim's great
2176943	2183452	DarkTetsuya asks if it's time for the classic font of the week.
2183973	2186657	I'm much more prone to use the word typeface.
2187418	2189561	I think it sounds a little bit classier.
2190618	2193961	Our comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com, of course.
2194361	2199365	The typeface of the week is Adobe Kazalan Pro.
2199565	2199945	Stop.
2201086	2201827	No one care.
2204289	2204609	All right.
2205070	2209973	We're going to get into some gaming news tonight, of course, with you guys live in our chat room and the calls later on.
2210053	2211254	Classic Game of the Week and all that stuff.
2211635	2212776	First, some other quick plugs.
2212816	2215057	Again, if you're not already following us on Facebook, you should be.
2215117	2216939	Facebook.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.
2217339	2239267	and we are on Twitter as well twitter.com slash OLR we are also now on Google Plus we have a brand new Google Plus page I know it's a reason to go back and look at Google Plus but here's what I really like about Google Plus is that because thanks to the whole circle thing we could actually post things on Google Plus that only our listeners could see so if we ever wanted to do like a secret club
2239747	2268534	we could post it on Google Plus because it wouldn't be public so follow us on Google Plus put us in your circles over there and if any juicy gossip comes up you know in the next couple months we will post it so that only the followers in our circles can see kind of like online only secret club otherwise information about the show and pictures and all that stuff it's hard for me to give a URL to Google Plus because you can't have names yet but just search for us just type Orange Launch Radio we'll come right up it's very easy to find I'm sure somebody will link in a chat here in a minute
2270078	2273899	That's really it for housekeeping, so let's get into some news.
2297123	2326171	that's what happens when the game is free I'm kind of curious though I wonder how many of those are actually paying for parts of the game or just you know kind of like you know how I would probably be would just I might want to try that out well from what I understand you can get upgrades to the game for only five bucks like there's two different levels there's one where you can pay like a monthly fee and get all the good stuff and then there's one where you just pay five bucks and you get a lot of little upgrades that's kind of neat I guess it's not bad
2326331	2326591	Multiplayer
2356144	2357285	It's Deathmatch.
2357325	2358225	People like the Deathmatch stuff.
2358245	2362628	Well, speaking of multiplayer, I would actually like to check out the Halo Anniversary Edition at some point.
2362848	2364569	I do like original OG Halo.
2364869	2366250	I'd like to check that out at some point.
2367250	2369491	I would like to play Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7.
2369972	2371372	I don't know if you heard about the Halo thing.
2371392	2373433	You know all those Kinect features they were talking about?
2373493	2373714	Yeah.
2373874	2374474	Yeah, not at launch.
2377390	2379551	They apparently are having trouble making them work.
2379872	2380532	I'm like, really?
2380592	2389517	You were having trouble making a voice command that changed the resolution from original to the new graphics or whatever?
2389897	2391878	And also a voice command to throw a grenade?
2392079	2393739	You couldn't make that work at all?
2396241	2396801	Grenade.
2397682	2398142	Grenade.
2398202	2398502	Damn it.
2399043	2401524	It doesn't understand certain accents.
2404062	2405903	It's like you're saying grenade.
2406223	2406743	Grenade.
2406984	2407964	Did you say lemonade?
2409365	2411266	Here's a fresh glass of lemonade.
2411366	2412246	No, grenade.
2415988	2416188	Yeah.
2416768	2419590	So, well, I guess that's good.
2420090	2423532	Maybe some other MMOs Final Fantasy XIV should follow suit with that.
2426050	2427031	I think it's going to have to.
2427471	2428931	I'm already over Final Fantasy XIV.
2428951	2430132	I haven't touched it in like two weeks.
2431012	2434414	Well, Final Fantasy XIV isn't officially in launch until about a year from now.
2434454	2435434	I would like to see the whole 2.0.
2436774	2438655	At least DC Universe didn't have to launch a 2.0.
2439235	2445138	You're just getting the game that everybody wanted to play, but no one wanted to pay $60 in a monthly fee to play.
2445558	2451200	I mean, no shit they got a million people because tons of people wanted to play this game, but they were like, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for it.
2453427	2453827	DarkSakura.com
2470700	2475144	The Simpsons Arcade Game has been classified in Australia.
2475565	2482271	What that means is that the rating has actually shown up on the Australian Classification Board's website.
2482612	2489759	So it seems to indicate that the Simpsons Arcade Game could be on its way to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network because...
2490599	2519284	Backbone is the one that is I guess registered the game Backbone Entertainment they do a lot of the like classic games stuff one of the more recent ones they did was the X-Men Arcade port and it is saying it's published by Konami so I don't know how that all works because I thought EA had the license but maybe some agreement was reached after all when the Ninja Turtles arcade game came out they did have a mutual agreement there so maybe something's been worked out so we may be getting the Simpsons arcade game on Xbox Live Arcade very soon which
2519824	2521025	Fuck yes to that.
2521065	2523146	That was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day.
2523326	2528408	I want to say we did a list list some time ago about Xbox Live Arcade game they most need and that was on it.
2529728	2531449	So, heck yeah, that would be awesome.
2531749	2532890	I hope they didn't screw it up.
2534170	2536351	But if it's like the X-Men Arcade port, I think it'll be fine.
2536871	2538912	And some of the other stuff they've done has been alright.
2540713	2541914	Alright, DarkSakura.
2543514	2546396	Actually, I was checking the mailbox again to make sure we actually had something this time.
2547376	2547576	We do.
2548036	2549237	Hooray.
2550020	2554584	It's been going around, people have been talking about it, about the security breach with Valve.
2555465	2560609	Valve actually did acknowledge that users' personal information had been compromised.
2560629	2562631	There was a security breach.
2563792	2576302	They said that they accessed a Steam database in addition to the forums that usernames, passwords, game purchases, email address, billing addresses, credit card information...
2577283	2606410	um they don't have evidence that credit card information or personal identification was taken um or that the protection on them was cracked they're still trying to get into that but um they said watch your stuff very closely which is why the only thing that's remotely linked on my Steam account is that I use PayPal that's it well lucky you but yeah my credit card of course was on Steam go figure
2607216	2612322	Actually, I don't think the new one is, because mine elapsed during the year, and I'm not sure I ever put the new one on.
2612342	2615726	I don't really buy a lot of stuff on Steam, and when I do, I just get it through PayPal.
2615766	2616947	I buy tons on Steam.
2617468	2621553	But, yeah, I don't know.
2621793	2625798	You'd think I'd be more pissed off about this because of what happened with Sony, but I don't know.
2625818	2626759	There's a certain...
2628806	2633489	There's a certain trust you kind of have with Valve because they get so much other stuff.
2633609	2638913	And I kind of feel like they're being a little more upfront with this than maybe necessarily Sony was.
2639433	2642575	And I do feel like a lot of the data was probably encrypted pretty well.
2643175	2643376	So...
2644156	2663583	I don't know well here's a statement from Newell we do not know of any compromised Steam accounts so we are not planning to force a change of Steam account passwords which are separate from the forum passwords however it wouldn't be a bad idea to change that as well especially if it's the same as your Steam forum account password so
2666533	2687491	I think also at the end of the day, the fault of this is not Valve's fault, it's the hacker's fault I don't know what Valve did to necessarily provoke this besides maybe Gabe Newell getting up there at GDC and saying that it was unhackable and kind of daring people to do it at some point I don't think that he would do that
2687991	2690653	And it wasn't quite the way I'm saying it either.
2690713	2694476	He was just kind of showing about the security protection and all that, the Steam Guard and all that.
2695376	2697818	But at the end of the day, these guys weren't in there to steal games.
2698939	2701920	And maybe they didn't steal the credit card information.
2702321	2705743	I think Valve is just being very upfront that, hey, that information was at risk.
2706604	2708085	And I don't know.
2708185	2713028	The PlayStation Network kind of felt like a Benny Hill show from the beginning.
2713628	2717431	It was one person tripping over another from there.
2718031	2745699	but I mean obviously I'm not like I'm a little bit upset and I'd like to kind of see what Valve is going to do to make sure that my information doesn't stay at risk you know I want to hear more constant updates about what they do find out about what was taken and not and if they do suspect that credit card information was taken then they need to offer a lot of the same services like the debix and all that that PlayStation was offering but I don't know I kind of trust them to do a better job with their PR than I do Sony
2747702	2769839	at the end of the day no one ever had money taken from them on Sony either so and hopefully nobody has money taken from them on Valve either chat.orangeloundtrader.com some of the comments Salacious Pop says the credit card info they got as hashed encrypted to shit so they'd have to crack that to do anything also Steam only lets you store one card on and it's very easy to delete it
2770699	2789669	Actdeft says Steam only saves the last cards you used GameGuru says Valve is how you are supposed to address being hacked DarkTetsuya says I did change my password even though I didn't really have any credit card info on it just out of habit for this sort of thing and that's a really good habit to have and if you haven't changed your Steam password you probably just should
2790629	2792370	What's to lose from doing it?
2792710	2798011	Nobody's ever given me a good reason why you shouldn't change your password besides I can't keep track of all those different passwords.
2798071	2802072	Well, you're going to have to come up with a better excuse than that in this day and age.
2802352	2802852	You know what I mean?
2804712	2806173	Kaijudo has a very good point, though.
2806213	2809053	Just because Valve is run by nerds doesn't mean they're hack-proof.
2809473	2810234	Nothing is.
2810794	2813054	And GameGuru also puts this pretty clear here.
2813434	2814915	Valve's been clear and upfront.
2815035	2816535	Sony tried to hide everything.
2816975	2817696	That's true, too.
2817756	2824360	I do seem to remember that Sony, you know, the network was still up for a few days after, and then it was bad.
2824680	2831004	Chat.OrangeOnlineRadio.com is the place where those comments are coming from right now, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
2831864	2837008	Khasin in our chat room, K-H-A-S-N, says, I need to check my credit card transactions.
2837308	2839909	That's just a good thing to do anyway.
2840370	2843972	Like, yeah, this should motivate you to do that, but just, I think...
2844412	2848494	Check them at least once a week, if not like three times a week.
2848834	2850155	I check my bank account every day.
2850255	2854957	Just A, I like to know how much money is in there because who actually balances a checkbook anymore?
2855437	2860980	And B, I just like to see that all the transactions that are going through are things that I actually initiated.
2861645	2866868	Well, before the show, I checked my PayPal, just to be sure.
2866988	2869089	And, of course, there's nothing, because I'm broke.
2869429	2869769	That's good.
2870069	2870929	That's what you want to see.
2871090	2871470	But, yeah.
2872030	2876952	I mean, the last thing on there was last month when I bought the Humble Indie Bundle.
2877893	2878233	That was it.
2878613	2878813	Nice.
2880314	2880574	All right.
2881925	2885631	Alright, well hopefully we'll get more information on that in the weeks to come as to who did it.
2886212	2887294	Hang them up by their balls.
2887675	2888116	Who done it?
2888557	2888998	Who done it?
2889759	2891322	It was Miss Scarlet in the conservatory.
2892845	2896128	And of course, Steam isn't the only thing to get hacked this week.
2896409	2906858	Also, the My Resistance website, the official website for the game Resistance from Sony, got hacked as well, and their forums are down as well.
2908780	2917808	And basically, there's no... It hasn't been immediately verified by Insomniac or Sony whether...
2918969	2919551	Anything was done.
2919591	2928608	I don't think anything's really compromised other than these people's usernames and passwords and maybe emails because you don't store credit card information on this website.
2931767	2934628	Basically, yeah, it sucks.
2934948	2935648	Hackers are going to hack.
2937088	2937748	I guess that's true.
2937788	2940289	We have said that before.
2940529	2942409	What do they get from this besides?
2942429	2946270	Because it's not like they have credit cards on the Resistance site or anything like that, right?
2946970	2957532	I think what they could be doing is they could be harvesting usernames and passwords, maybe emails and stuff to try to run those against logins on the PlayStation Network.
2958352	2966197	to see if any of those people have the same username, password, login info that they would on both of those.
2967217	2972641	I don't know if maybe there's a way to link your account to that site or something.
2972661	2974482	I don't think you'd have to put your password in there for that.
2974882	2986629	But my guess is it's mainly just to find username, password combos that they can try at a bunch of different websites and see if people are using the same things and maybe get access to accounts that way.
2988453	2990975	Alright, well more hacking stories.
2991316	2996921	The Xbox hackings are still kind of slowly bubbling through the press and so forth.
2997421	3002926	I've addressed this on a show before, if you forgot, I had $150 stolen from my Xbox back in August.
3002946	3006009	It was about August 14th, 15th or so that that happened.
3006469	3012171	and I basically lost access to my Xbox for a month while they were investigating and finally got my money back.
3012311	3015712	I think it was about 28 days after the incident had happened.
3016213	3020814	So I was out 150 bucks for 28 days and that's not something I know everybody can afford to do.
3021494	3022515	So you gotta be very careful.
3023175	3028877	Microsoft refuses that anything is going on but I know at least 10 individuals that this has happened to.
3029197	3030257	I am not making that number up.
3030498	3034539	Granted, I have a lot of Facebook friends and people on Twitter but I know at least 10 individuals
3034739	3049938	and then I still have people telling me like friends of friends and so forth so I know that doesn't seem like a very large number but considering I know people all through the spectrum from people who play games all the time every day to people that hadn't touched their account in one to two years
3050879	3052800	That tells me that something's going on.
3053360	3056961	And this shit made me angry this week as I saw that there was a report on Eurogamer.
3057001	3058001	I'm not mad at Eurogamer.
3058021	3058901	They're just reporting it.
3058981	3060042	Don't shoot the messenger, right?
3060562	3076887	And apparently Microsoft is claiming that all these FIFA Ultimate Team Pack purchases that are the, quote, hacks going on, Microsoft is claiming in an interview with Eurogamer from Online Safety Director Doug Park, it is not a hack, that it is some type of, quote, new attack vector.
3077207	3078287	Quote, it's not a hack.
3078667	3081729	It's really just a different way to monetize stolen accounts.
3083069	3083289	What?
3084750	3086131	Any service has compromises.
3086251	3087611	Facebook has compromises.
3087711	3088872	Wow has compromises.
3089232	3092073	What they're really doing is trying to make money off those compromises.
3092394	3094214	So FIFA is a very popular title.
3094475	3096556	It's just a new way for the bad guys to make money.
3096876	3098597	It wasn't based on our investigation.
3098677	3099717	We didn't see anything new.
3099837	3101098	It was just a different avenue.
3101858	3105541	I'm not getting into super detail, but there's basics of account compromise.
3105581	3108583	There's phishing, there's social engineering, there's malware.
3108863	3111905	Based off the industry today, most of it comes off malware and phishing.
3111985	3113526	If they get the accounts, they sell it.
3113887	3115108	That's really all they were doing.
3115168	3121492	Whether it's FIFA or an account with a PlayStation subscription or an account with a live subscription, it's all basically the same thing.
3122813	3129618	So basically, he's deflecting, he's refusing to accept that anything's going wrong at Xbox, and you, sir, are lying.
3130933	3138267	you may not know you're lying but I'm here to tell you that these claims that this is all like phishing and all this stuff you're full of crap
3139281	3139741	Wake up!
3140301	3142082	Because something deeper is going on here.
3142242	3144783	And it has to do with Xbox, and it has to do with EA.
3145623	3147764	Because I will poke a hole in this right now.
3148244	3150845	The people that are getting hacked, it's not just FIFA.
3151565	3152405	Dun-dun-dun!
3153045	3154426	It's other EA games.
3155166	3158287	I know somebody that got money stolen out of Madden.
3158867	3164269	I know somebody where the first game that they went into to go play on it was...
3165629	3166250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3186294	3195402	Can anyone show me a game or an Xbox hack that's going on that did not somehow involve an EA product?
3196363	3197244	Can anyone show that?
3198245	3208054	Chat.orangenowlandsradio.com Twitter.com slash OLR Is anyone that's been impacted, where money has been taken out of the account, was an EA game not involved?
3208935	3211197	Because I'll tell you what, I think I know the link.
3213448	3220132	The link is, I believe that the people that are getting hacked are people that do not play EA Sports games.
3222873	3230217	I've never played an EA Sports game on Xbox Live, save for Burnout Paradise, which does not have the EA Network.
3231277	3235479	Some of the other, like Rock Band, which isn't a part of that new EA Network and all that.
3236120	3242263	Other people that I know that have been hacked do not play EA Sports games online, or they have not played their Xbox in several years.
3244688	3252071	if you do not have your Xbox account tied to the new EA system you are vulnerable
3253726	3275241	I believe that I don't have any proof but trending that I see so I'm just some schmo on a podcast putting that out there whatever take it or leave it but I'm telling you I think if you want to best protect yourself one thing that you should do right now well in addition to change your password which I've told you 5,000 times to do and if you haven't done it by now I don't know what to tell you but I think what you should do
3276141	3283824	Go download the demo for either NBA Jam on Fire or Need for Speed The Run, which, granted, wasn't a bad demo.
3284444	3288325	When you play those demos, you're going to have to create an EA account to get onto those servers.
3288885	3296888	And now you'll establish a link between your Xbox and your EA account because I'm telling you, when I got hacked, they linked a fake account up.
3297768	3322929	and somehow there's some vulnerability there that neither Microsoft nor EA will admit but I'm telling you there's too much of a trend here for me to ignore as a gamer as somebody who doesn't want the fans of this show to lose money I'm just telling you what I'm seeing in all these other cases are people that have not linked the EA account through some type of sports title are the ones that are being hacked I don't know how they're doing it but that's the common denominator damn it
3323248	3340830	at the very least going ahead and associating it with an account would prevent whatever exploit there might be from being used I don't think it's necessarily that they're not getting hacked it's just that they're not buying anything with it because once they find out oh well I can't get access to the EA thing then well not much I can do there
3342699	3348283	And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that this bozo would go out there and say that we're all being phished.
3348863	3349624	Because he's wrong.
3349804	3353787	I know somebody that hadn't touched their Xbox in two years.
3354748	3357490	Like, I'm supposed to believe that guy somehow got phished?
3357910	3363874	Oh, I haven't played my Xbox in two years, but shit, I'm gonna log onto this website and just give them my Xbox login.
3364335	3364615	Really? !
3367225	3396188	I like to think I'm somewhat smarter than that too I mean I like to think I mean I'm not gonna be all Sony big in the head about it that I am in penetratable when it comes to getting you know my information fished or whatever but I'd like to think I always think twice about links I click on and websites I'm visiting and make sure the websites are genuine so if this guy's gonna come out and say that I'm getting fished you better be ready to throw down because you might be wrong and if you're wrong I'm gonna be double mad
3402540	3417227	5thDream in our chatroom at chat.orangesoundstrater.com says you'd be amazed how many people don't know the password that their email address associated with their Xbox Live accounts get it reset, you gotta do something take control of that, especially if you have a credit card tied to it
3417927	3446856	they're getting in there somehow I don't know what they're doing I don't know how they're doing it if we knew it would be all over the gaming media but nobody can figure out how they're doing it and Microsoft won't admit that there's a problem because somehow they're both being used Microsoft and EA and I don't I can't figure out how somebody's gonna figure it out though honestly I think they should start looking into their password reset system
3447634	3457863	I want to say one more thing about this because this is the other thing that this guy is deflecting because he tries to throw all these other companies under the bus and he says any service has compromises.
3458263	3459585	Wow has compromises.
3460405	3461286	Okay, true point.
3461446	3462908	I've also had my Wow account hacked.
3463188	3465950	I think I know how that happened and I do think that was phishing.
3466010	3469654	I think I used, I logged into a computer that I shouldn't have logged into Wow in.
3469714	3470734	So, okay, fair enough.
3470815	3472796	You know, again, I said earlier, I'm not perfect.
3473097	3474278	It can't happen, okay?
3474979	3478750	But there's a big difference between what WoW is doing and what Microsoft's doing.
3480899	3484502	Blizzard will openly admit that your accounts are vulnerable to theft.
3484902	3487264	That people will try and steal your Xbox accounts.
3487664	3497312	Blizzard will sell an authenticator so that you can get into your accounts and try to bring incentives for you to use those authenticators like free pets and so forth.
3497612	3501235	They've come up with new ways of authentication like authenticating by phone.
3501475	3504117	They are constantly trying to change the security in their system.
3504378	3505679	What are you doing, Microsoft?
3506439	3508421	Oh, we're watching the situation very closely.
3510146	3515170	On top of that, they give away the authenticator for free and the only thing that you have to pay for is if you buy a physical authenticator.
3515270	3515611	That's true.
3515631	3517152	They have the mobile phone authenticator for free.
3517172	3517913	Which is what I use.
3518013	3518653	That's very true.
3518733	3519194	Good point.
3520395	3521896	Microsoft doesn't have anything like that.
3522216	3525339	Microsoft doesn't tell people to change their passwords regularly.
3525599	3529442	Microsoft won't admit that there's people out there trying to steal money from your account.
3530163	3559146	and at least if they're doing it I'm sure they would come back and say well Rob it is right here on the website okay on some page people never look at and a font size not big enough anyone can see it it is right there on the login screen as you're waiting for the game to load on WoW protect your account from theft do A, B, and C that's the level of stuff that Microsoft needs to do because accounts are being stolen and it's not just you know because we're all stupid when it comes to learning the internet
3560757	3562159	Anyhow, I've ranted enough.
3562579	3562879	Sorry.
3563340	3565022	But I just, it just irritates me.
3565442	3570147	This is such corporate, you know, just talking out his butt.
3570948	3575793	And it irritates me the more Microsoft tries to deny that anything is wrong.
3576124	3579925	You know what another term for talking out of your butt is?
3580405	3580765	Farting.
3581986	3582706	Or shit.
3582806	3584026	I said I was dumb, but I'm not.
3584166	3596590	Furthermore, maybe it would irritate me a lot less if that, you know, the other part of this is that I was locked out of my Xbox account for 28 days.
3598730	3601251	How long was I out of my WoW account when I got hacked?
3602651	3602951	A day?
3603132	3603672	An hour.
3604472	3604732	Okay.
3607113	3608294	Fix it, Microsoft!
3609935	3610895	And have better fonts.
3612957	3613497	Moving on.
3630948	3641775	Um, it's actually, um, there's also the beacons functionality added in so that, um, you can, um, say which games you would like to play with other people.
3642015	3643295	And that's actually on Xbox Live now.
3643936	3651380	Um, new messaging, new browsing, um, new searching for films and TV, that type of thing.
3652201	3656003	And, um, they have a new interface that goes with the Metro UI theme.
3657124	3657344	So...
3659246	3662629	I guess that's cool, but honestly it's not enough.
3663230	3663811	But it's something.
3666880	3671384	Well, it's better than what was there before, which was, you know, he's still having to call support and all that stuff.
3671444	3678790	But by the way, just just to throw it out there, certain other subscription things you cannot cancel online as easily still.
3679270	3681412	So although it may make it sound like there's certain things.
3681692	3684034	And by the way, I tried to go in the first thing I tried to do.
3684695	3685996	Not only did Microsoft.
3686176	3686676	Oh, God.
3686837	3688098	Oh, I'm so mad at them lately.
3688578	3691941	Not only did Microsoft automatically update my credit card info.
3692561	3693261	I don't know what they did.
3693281	3695062	Did they guess the new expiration date?
3695462	3700444	I don't know how they did it, but they automatically updated my credit card information.
3700624	3701545	I can't remove it.
3702605	3706547	You can't remove your credit card on the website.
3706587	3716431	You try to click remove and it goes, you cannot remove this card because you are currently using this card to pay for your one month card of Xbox Live.
3717594	3718295	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3718475	3724299	I can't remove my credit card because I'm using it to fund a prepaid Xbox Live card?
3726541	3729223	No, that's when you report it to the Better Business Bureau.
3732325	3732926	Ridiculous.
3733686	3735608	But Rob, you're paying for the free card.
3736108	3736328	What?
3736669	3738370	I said, but you're paying for the free card.
3738390	3738950	Yeah.
3743424	3744004	That's hilarious.
3744625	3748367	I mean, not in a funny way, but just... I was like, seriously?
3748587	3749867	You guys are going to go that far?
3750167	3757711	So much smoke and mirrors from Microsoft to the point where I am seriously considering the next console.
3757971	3760333	Somebody called me out on Twitter, too, about it, which is fine.
3760513	3761233	That's fine.
3761253	3761893	I have an opinion.
3761933	3765055	If you think there's a problem with it, then whatever.
3765695	3772139	But somebody had said, wait, you were mad at Microsoft when PlayStation was the one that got hacked and all that?
3773119	3780222	Fair point, but still, has anyone presented a case where somebody actually had money stolen from them from PlayStation?
3780842	3782402	Has anyone been able to prove that?
3783683	3787664	Because I could prove to you about 10 different cases of money being stolen.
3788424	3791385	Many, many more if you look at the web forums that are out there on Xbox.
3792626	3793926	Why are we all mad at Sony again?
3797607	3799068	Because of the potential loss.
3800154	3801435	The potential, Rob.
3802697	3803778	We're gonna be mad at Sony.
3803838	3810164	Be mad at Sony about, you know, them Bumble fucking tripping over their own feet in handling the situation.
3810685	3812667	I'm just saying, Microsoft's really no better.
3814824	3815705	Well, this is their MO.
3815745	3818648	I mean, look at what they did with the Red Ring systems and stuff like that.
3819448	3820870	Oh, it was a small percentage.
3821270	3821951	Oh, it was like 1%.
3822611	3827015	Definitely not 100% or 50% or whatever.
3827175	3828096	So just flip it.
3828136	3828937	That's all I'm saying.
3829297	3830919	The folks that are saying that, flip it.
3831700	3834742	Why do you give Microsoft a pass all the time?
3838126	3840548	Let's be equally critical of all the game companies.
3842355	3842836	We should.
3842856	3844157	Nintendo, why aren't you embracing online?
3844177	3845879	Well, we should when we give them hundreds of dollars.
3847020	3847541	Which we do.
3848282	3851405	I have a right to be critical of a company I'm giving hundreds of dollars to.
3853428	3855290	That holds my credit card hostage, but anyway.
3856511	3857032	Let's move on.
3857072	3858774	Release dates.
3859114	3863139	I love video games, I do, but just some of this stuff I could do without.
3864228	3868450	Continuing on with the plethora of releases coming out.
3868970	3871972	Of course, today was Super Mario 3D Land for the 3DS.
3872952	3878995	Carnival Games Wild West 3D for the 3DS coming out this week as well.
3879555	3882977	Kung Fu High Impact on Xbox 360 for Kinect.
3883337	3885458	It's like that one game that they have on the PlayStation Network.
3885858	3889900	It's like a side-scroller Kung Fu game that uses the Kinect camera.
3891501	3909020	LA Noire The Complete Edition on PC this week I believe that's also coming on other systems too Fossil Fighters Champions on Nintendo DS Saints Row the 3rd on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC actually thinking about picking up the PC version as well because it looks pretty sweet
3910221	3933675	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Mario and Sonic at the London Olympic Games on the Nintendo Wii Dynasty Warriors 7 Extreme Legends that's on PlayStation 3 Plants vs. Zombies on PlayStation 3 as well Bejeweled 3 on Nintendo DS and
3935646	3938651	Looks like... I imagine Fashion Designer on the 3DS.
3939573	3940093	Oh, yay.
3940474	3940955	Hooray.
3941456	3943619	Price is Right Decades on Xbox 360.

3960059	3962220	Get Up and Dance on PlayStation 3 and Wii.

4254144	4262931	There is also a game coming out called Naorihan no Mago Hiyaki Rairo Ran Taisen that comes out this week from Konami.
4263652	4266795	This looks like... I'm trying to figure out what game this is.
4266855	4268336	I don't know if it's based on an anime.
4270918	4272599	It is a fighting game that's coming out.
4273340	4281267	From the strongest team to defeat the Haragomo Kitsune, that powerful fox spirit has been devouring people and usurping power since the Heian era...
4281767	4287032	and Riko, the leader of Hakai Yayo, the March of 100 Ogres, is the one to defeat her.
4287573	4292838	So it's a fighting game on the 360 that I am not familiar with on this side of the pond.
4293919	4298303	Going to the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty in subtitles there as well.
4298703	4303668	Ni no Kuni, Shiroki Seihai no Ju comes out from level 5 this week.
4304688	4308250	This is a... Oh, it's the Studio Ghibli game on PlayStation 3.
4309590	4311971	That looks like it could be very impressive, actually.
4312111	4313672	That looks... Oh, it's all cartoony.
4314612	4315692	That game's very cute.
4315712	4316273	Let me look.
4316293	4316573	Wait, wait.
4316593	4316853	Go back.
4316953	4317733	Look at that.
4318753	4320754	This is the Studio Ghibli on PlayStation 3.
4320794	4321995	That's cute.
4322255	4322475	Yeah.
4323735	4326036	That looks like it would be worth importing.
4326237	4326897	Yeah.
4327037	4329618	It is Ni no Kuni.
4329758	4331999	It's a magical land on the PlayStation 3.
4332660	4336001	The orphan Oliver is determined to save his mother who died to save him.
4336361	4343545	In order to do so, he followed Shizuku, the fairy of the tears, into the world of Ni no Kuni to defeat the evil magician Jabo.
4343565	4343865	Huh.

4440245	4440665	That's it.
4440985	4441446	Busy, busy.
4442306	4447469	In our chat room, by the way, they are talking about Ni No Kuni, which I had mentioned before, the Studio Ghibli game.
4447489	4452652	They are saying, some folks, Alpha Cananogram says, they did say that it's coming to North America, I think.
4452692	4454413	And Dark Tetsuya says, I thought it was coming out over here.
4454753	4456554	Yeah, it probably is, but not this week.
4456955	4458055	Japan's getting it first.
4458496	4461677	If we're getting it, what, summer next year, maybe?
4461817	4462218	Spring.
4462518	4462838	Spring.
4462958	4464579	Oh, you looked it up, huh?
4465159	4466140	No, I just know.
4466730	4467230	Oh, well.
4468290	4468971	So we are getting it.
4468991	4470831	It's just going to take a little time for the translation.
4471051	4471191	Yeah.
4471211	4475152	All right, a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4475712	4487416	But first... Well, everyone's been wondering with the Vita, is there going to be a way for me to import my games that I may have on UMD to the Vita?
4487856	4488656	And the answer is yes.
4488876	4490196	There is actually a way to do that.
4490596	4492977	And it's not free, but...
4493197	4495659	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4514176	4529833	and of course they haven't announced prices over here yet since the Vita is still a ways away but in Japan it ranges between an average of 500 and 1000 yen so it's not bad I mean that's a pretty good compromise I think
4531134	4539723	and, you know, really, if you want to abuse that, you could take a friend's, you know, UMD or rent a UMD or something like that, pop it in there, register it like you own it.
4540123	4545548	I mean, there's no way for them to know, but at least you get a little bit of a discount if you're planning on actually buying the game anyways.
4546009	4552335	I still don't like the fact that I'm having to basically put in the UMD to have the privilege of paying for the game all over again.
4552875	4554597	Well, I mean, I get it.
4554737	4555318	It just sucks.
4555868	4558850	I mean, the only reason they're doing that is because they know people are going to abuse it.
4559631	4560311	Because they can.
4561152	4568498	And because, really, just play it on your PSP then if you don't want to pay for it.
4570459	4571160	I guess that's true.
4572641	4575463	Still, wouldn't it be nice if they just had true backwards compatibility?
4575583	4577505	But I guess you can't do that when you change formats.
4579502	4596198	Anyhow Well it's going to be backwards compatible It's just obviously you can't Not really though Well There's no UMD drive, big deal It's an antiquated format Alright, moving on What about the digital copies of games I bought?
4596298	4599961	I bought 32nd Hero digitally Will I be able to just download that to my Vita?
4600101	4602744	Yes Okay, then I'm fine Then that's good
4603923	4606525	All that stuff is tied to your network account and you can redownload to that.
4606985	4609368	But it's just UMD games.
4609988	4612431	There's no way to transfer that because they're not going to make a UMD drive.
4612471	4614432	I feel a little better then.
4615453	4620758	Moving on to information about Super Mario 3D Land, which was of course a big release today.
4620778	4621439	It came out today.
4621859	4623421	A lot of people are very excited about that.
4623861	4627044	I want to pick this up at some point amongst all the other games.
4627845	4628285	Here's the thing.
4629406	4635990	It is one of the games I want to get for the 3DS, but I just don't see myself playing it anytime soon, and I'm in no big hurry.
4636190	4636830	It's a Mario game.
4636870	4640212	I know it's going to be good, but it's not like I've got to rush out and go get it.
4640993	4642294	I have been hearing a lot of good things about it.
4642514	4646616	It's getting really good reviews, but it's getting lost amongst all the Modern Warfare and Skyrim chatter.
4646856	4648978	But this is one for the younger crowd, too.
4649058	4652440	It reminds me a lot of Mario Galaxy, but just in the 3DS.
4653560	4676403	and that's not a bad thing because Mario Galaxy is fucking great but anyway there is a help system in the game a lot of the newer Nintendo games have kind of held your hand a little bit if you constantly fuck up and Mario 3D Land is no different it's been revealed through people playing the game today that if you die twice you'll get a free power up at the beginning of the level like a random power up that happens if you die five times in a level
4677043	4681288	You get a Tanooki suit that's basically invincibility the whole way through the level.
4681468	4684571	So it's like you can't die unless you are just a baddie.
4686734	4690918	So it really will help you handle... I mean, can you imagine if the original Mario Brothers had did that?
4690998	4693701	Like, oh, you're having problems beating World 8 too?
4694042	4695403	You can't get through these Hammer Brothers?
4695723	4697906	Here, have invincibility through the entire level.
4699298	4701640	That's just why I saved P-Wings and flew over the whole damn thing.
4702220	4704462	So that's where we're at now.
4704722	4709365	Now here's the interesting thing though is that you're only allowed to do that the first time you beat a level.
4710065	4715369	If you're trying to go back and look for coins, be a completionist and so forth, you don't get help.
4716069	4721773	So if you're going to go collect coins and shit, you better do it the first time you have that Tanooki suit because you won't be getting it again.
4723454	4725396	So that's the help in Mario 3D.
4726696	4730398	Anyhow, what's all this newfangled 3D stuff?
4731099	4733100	You remember a time when gaming was simpler?
4733420	4736442	We didn't have all this newfangled 3D Mario Galaxy.
4738463	4740024	No, we had Super Mario Bros.
4740044	4740064	2D.
4742276	4742836	We liked it.
4743357	4751321	We're going to travel back to a simpler time where DarkSakura is going to get into the Classic Gaming Vault and find a game that she says, Hey, hey, I don't want to hear about your Skyrim.
4751742	4755023	I want to hear about your Modern Warfare, your 3DSs.
4755604	4757245	I don't know about your Skyrim job.
4758065	4760767	Go play this game because this is Classic Gaming.
4761232	4764333	I think that you should play the intro to the game.
4765074	4766694	A lot of people are just going to pick it up right from the start.
4766714	4767875	They're going to get it right away.
4767895	4771276	Alright, well then let's go right to the intro of this week's classic game of the week.
4771316	4779739	This is an oldie goodie.
4782200	4784801	Or maybe you were like five when this game came out.
4784841	4786362	Well, I said rock on purpose.
4786682	4788343	I bet a lot of our listeners were.
4789694	4803053	Mega Man X, also known as Rockman X which came out on Super Nintendo or also the Super Famicom in 1993 in Japan 1994 in North America
4805456	4807037	There's PC versions, yay.
4808078	4811920	But this is probably one of the best of the series.
4812801	4821346	So, it's like, in the future, Mega Man X was made by Dr. Light, and stored away in a capsule for 30 years, and Dr. Light probably died.
4822047	4832894	So this other one named Dr. Kane finds him, and, well, he made a bunch of robots based on X, and they all went crazy, so basically X has to go stop him.
4833354	4835555	We have zero in this game, that's awesome!
4836295	4844278	So, uh, this is what really, I think, where the Mega Man games were really cool, you know?
4844298	4845819	And I've always thought they were really awesome.
4845839	4855142	I think, though, that having the X series really kind of launched it into the next level, if you'll pardon me for using the phrase.
4856103	4856463	Don't you think?
4858378	4863483	Anyway, as it went through, we had more characters.
4863503	4865465	Like I said, there was Zero who was brought in.
4865565	4870770	There was Axel, Sigma, you know, as the bad guy.
4873172	4876635	And then, so moving through, there were also, of course, later games.
4876675	4882160	There was all the way up through Mega Man X8, I think was the last one.
4888360	4888588	Anyway.
4893922	4894542	That's what I meant.
4895803	4897223	Yeah, X8 was the last one.
4897363	4897984	I had to be sure.
4898024	4899004	Well, I was pretty sure.
4901105	4903366	But, you know, we've also had different versions of them.
4903826	4917752	There's been Mega Man Extreme and Extreme 2, which in Japan was called Rockman X Cyber Mission and Rockman X2 Soul Eraser, which is just a freaking cool name.
4918512	4923214	We've also had Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, which was the re-release for PSP.
4925609	4933813	So, I mean, basically, he's got different abilities apart from just, you know, the shooting and, you know, you kill the robot, you get the power, blah, blah, blah.
4934434	4937715	He can also dash, and you can get an air dash later on.
4938356	4941297	You get all these power-ups.
4941337	4944899	You can also charge your weapon, too, which is really useful.
4944919	4952003	That means you can also charge the weapons that you inherit from other Mavericks, so that's pretty cool.
4953002	4957943	and they have interesting names, some of these Mavericks, like Toxic Seahorse.
4959764	4968206	But they're pretty much element-based, you know, you get your fire, water, lightning, wind, magnetism, time, all kinds of stuff.
4968866	4975608	So, uh, really there's not much else, you know, I can really say about that because it's freakin' Mega Man X and if you haven't played it, where have you been?
4976368	4976888	Go play it!
4977608	4979869	There's billions and billions of versions out there to try.
4980629	4982811	Some comments from our chatroom at chat.org.com.
4982831	4985733	Hitstun says, actually, I played this game on PC first.
4986113	4989975	There was a PC demo that was just the intro stage until Sigma showed up, but I thought it was awesome.
4990195	4991676	I do remember this game on PC, actually.
4992177	4993077	There was a PC port.
4993378	4996199	There was an old-ass Mega Man game on PC that was really terrible.
4996220	4997400	It was only like three stages.
4998241	5001303	Anyway, but that's not X. But anyway, let's see.
5002964	5007447	Also, I got schooled because I said earlier, remember I said back when we didn't have 3D games and all that?
5007947	5010189	ActDev said we had 3D Rad Racer.
5011510	5012510	Oh, I got burned.
5012530	5013631	You did.
5013671	5014011	I did.
5014472	5017373	The shutter glasses that came out with the Master System.
5017393	5018014	No, it was red-blue.
5018094	5018314	Oh, yeah.
5018374	5020956	No, but there was Zaxxon 3D.
5021696	5022617	Yes, yes.
5022637	5023477	Yeah, the shutter glasses.
5023637	5025579	All right, so I guess we did have 3D gaming back then.
5025619	5026099	I got told.
5026359	5027520	Dude, what are you doing?
5027640	5029021	Not really in the Super Nintendo era.
5029421	5030282	Are you playing Saints Row?
5030302	5032563	Loki is playing Saints Row with his dildo bat.
5032883	5034625	Are you going to hit somebody in the face with your dildo bat?
5035465	5035785	You just...
5038095	5040497	Okay, this is terrible radio if I watch this.
5040997	5041337	Good.
5041617	5042338	It's floppy.
5042358	5044779	Who wants a floppy dildo?
5044999	5051223	He literally threw a guy to the ground and then posed like, hey, like a little swimsuit model pose on the guy.
5051984	5052264	Wow.
5054205	5056026	What's the purpose of having a floppy dildo?
5056286	5060048	You just kicked that fat guy in the crotch and then whapped him with your dildo.
5060068	5060928	They kicked a woman.
5061508	5061829	That was a woman.
5061849	5062709	That was a woman.
5062749	5063429	That was a pat.
5065190	5065750	It was a pat.
5066271	5066611	All right.
5067331	5068752	Anyway, there it is.
5068792	5070112	Your classic game of the week.
5071213	5074134	Mega Man X. Good pick, DarkSakura.
5074174	5074514	Good pick.
5074694	5075095	I know.
5075215	5075575	Thank you.
5075715	5075935	All right.
5076395	5078337	We're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere.
5078817	5084661	Those of you on the podcast will only be gone like five seconds, but those of you live, don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.
5085001	5095849	Your emails, which finally came through, phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, rapid fire news, talk of a Tumblr post that's taking everybody by storm, but I'm going to be a bitch about it.
5096229	5097250	So stay tuned for that.
5097290	5098210	What's new?
5098491	5098771	Shut up.
5098791	5099351	We'll be back.
5100552	5100752	See?
5101032	5103994	We'll be back in just a few more minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5104035	5104515	Don't go anywhere.
5110876	5113638	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5113718	5120161	We are live with the 435th episode of our show on this November the 13th of 2011.
5120802	5126585	And during the break there, I was watching Loki play a little bit of Saints Row the Third, which he has hooked up here in studio, which he's playing.
5127065	5128886	And he's just running around punching people in the face.
5129166	5130427	This game is very purple.
5130707	5137271	Like, I know I was getting that in the art and everything, but, like, the game, the knights, the sky is all lit up purple and the paws is purple.
5137611	5138132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5153021	5153381	Gotcha.
5154342	5154662	All right.
5154702	5155243	Well, there you go.
5155303	5155903	Saints Row.
5157224	5157844	We are live.
5157884	5164068	You can join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and comment on some of the rapid-fire news we're about to get to.
5164128	5167171	So, Loki, you got to pause Saints Row to go over some rapid-fire news.
5167471	5175096	Yes, and we'll talk a little bit more about Saints Row because Saints Row 4 has already been out by the guys over at THQ.
5175436	5176897	Saints Row in Space
5203258	5204379	Loki just pointed at me.
5204499	5204759	What?
5205060	5206521	You think that's it?
5206661	5208783	Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
5208823	5211085	Well, you said more over the top than this one.
5211165	5218331	I mean, like, how did the Friday the 13th series end up going, like, just too far over the top by sending Jason to space?
5219311	5221173	That is part of the DLC, actually.
5221233	5227778	It's pimps in space, or, like, gangsters in space is literally the...
5229528	5231209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5253707	5264110	and kind of coincidentally also Atlas announced that they're going to be publishing Game of Thrones on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 coming out this March if I remember correctly.
5266711	5272313	So yeah, lots of stuff based on that property I guess because it is pretty good actually.
5272373	5273173	People like that show.
5274594	5281216	And then of course, last but not least, Dead Island is receiving a patch which will do a few things.
5281756	5285517	Also going to be raising the level cap to 60.
5287037	5293378	And they also included some new blueprints for weapon mods added.
5294258	5297299	Infected damage reduced and a bunch of other gameplay improvements.
5297799	5304020	Also some fixes to the interface and just improved stability and network performance and co-op and that kind of stuff.
5304880	5306261	Neat.
5308601	5311823	In our chatroom at chat.orange.com, we're a little bit buffered here.
5311863	5314044	So the chat is just now hearing the Saints Row story.
5314544	5318166	And Orange Wright in our chatroom says, pimps at sea?
5320307	5322328	Is there Saints Row on the ocean?
5322568	5325169	Is there pirates versus ninjas in Saints Row?
5325929	5328251	You can have pirates or ninjas.
5329171	5332032	Well, I don't know about pirates, but I know you can have ninjas in your gang.
5332292	5335534	I was going to say, maybe that's somewhere they could go with it.
5337196	5339424	Gang Warfare on the high seas.
5339484	5341090	You can dress up like anything you want.
5343605	5345606	And GameGuru says, pimps in space?
5345706	5347428	Okay, I really need to get into Saints Row.
5348889	5349129	All right.
5350150	5353593	Moving on to... And THQ gives you no kickback, Loki, right?
5353633	5355375	You really are just that big a fanboy for Saints Row?
5355515	5356276	I like the game.
5356316	5356816	It's great.
5356976	5357417	There you go.
5357857	5358137	All right.
5358758	5359699	I like this game, too.
5359799	5362101	Final Fantasy XIII, and it's getting a sequel.
5362181	5363742	XIII-2 is coming out.
5364063	5365464	As if there weren't enough games coming out.
5365484	5367806	But the good news is this one's not out until early, early next year.
5368106	5371467	There are going to be some special edition packages for the game.
5371507	5374008	Now, I'm going to report on what's coming out in Europe.
5374348	5377689	However, apparently a lot of this is going to be coming to North America as well.
5378069	5392834	So there is going to be a collector's edition that will come with special packaging and a game, a composer soundtrack CD, an artwork book, six postcards featuring CG artwork of the characters, and a lenticular art print of Lightning, who isn't even the main character in the game, so go figure.
5393234	5404658	There's also, I guess, a Crystal Edition that comes with all that, but instead of a single CD, you get a four-disc soundtrack, and you get a Final Fantasy XIII-2 t-shirt that you can't get anywhere else.
5405338	5407799	And, of course, I guess like a little presentation box.
5408259	5416462	So a lot of the same pre-order stuff will be coming to America as well, because, hey, if you're going to spend $60 on a game, why not spend $80 and get a free t-shirt and soundtrack, huh?
5418391	5418732	Sure.
5419533	5419713	Sure.
5419733	5420775	You got to really love that, though.
5422417	5426463	There are some other Black Friday deals here that we wanted to mention real quick.
5427004	5434655	At this part, there is some special bundles coming out, and one of them of note is a Zelda 3DS bundle.
5435035	5439036	That's going to be like a special edition, and a lot of these have been cited around the internet.
5439356	5441917	This is making its way to the US for $179.
5442557	5446899	It's a black system that comes with The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D.
5447279	5451160	There's also going to be a flare red that comes with Mario 3D Land.
5451480	5453821	That is both available at Walmart.
5454321	5457262	Apparently GameStop is also going to have a similar system.
5457802	5461244	But unfortunately, they're not like special branded systems.
5461264	5464407	They're just the regular... Oh, I thought they had the Zelda artwork on it.
5464427	5465847	No, only in Europe.
5466148	5467669	Boo hiss.
5468389	5470991	Yeah, only plain Jane systems for us.
5471051	5472992	When I was reading about that, I thought it was special.
5473012	5473873	I'm glad you clarified.
5474833	5476515	Some rumors about the next Xbox.
5476655	5483419	Apparently, the prototype name is Loop, which is good that we have a different name for it now because it's not going to be Xbox 720.
5483759	5484880	Why would it be Xbox 720?
5486221	5487262	That's a huge assumption.
5487282	5488042	So I like Loop.
5488843	5492485	That makes me think that now they're naming these after books in the Ring series.
5492905	5493546	So we'll see.
5493566	5498689	Because, hey, Xbox 360 had a bunch of rings as their logo, so why not have Loop as the next one?
5499089	5501871	Anyhow, I guess it's some type of inside blog.
5501891	5503552	You know, take it with a grain of salt, whatever.
5504613	5506194	Loop is the code name for it.
5506614	5512358	It's supposed to have all this boosted technology called assistive cores inside.
5513439	5517803	including you know graphics, AI, physics, sound, networking, encryption, sensors.
5518324	5520326	It's supposed to be smaller and cheaper than the 360.
5520767	5523730	I'm assuming that means when the 360 initially came out.
5524191	5526714	It's going to run on a modified version of Windows 9.
5527795	5527975	That's
5527995	5529796	It's not too surprising, really, all things considered.
5529816	5532699	I mean, isn't the Xbox now starting to look more and more like Windows 8?
5533219	5534620	And some of the prototypes are showing for that?
5534640	5543588	Well, it's funny that it's running on Windows 9, and some of the rumors I've been hearing are like, it's going to be out either late next year or early next, you know, 2013.
5543688	5546570	I'm like, so they're going to go through 8 that fast?
5546830	5551474	Well, if it's a modified Windows 9, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation there.
5552295	5552735	So who knows?
5553395	5553516	So...
5554176	5554637	Whatever.
5554977	5556959	We're going to have rumors galore.
5556999	5558420	We won't have anything solid until evening.
5558440	5568069	And I'm not surprised either because I think that they're going to be... Windows 8, one of the things about that is they're going to do a lot of compatibility with different ARM processors and stuff.
5568549	5574795	So if they're trying to make it so that can run on pretty much everything, that wouldn't surprise me.
5574855	5577678	Why does the chat room think I said Xbox 360 Lube?
5577858	5578619	Did I say Lube?
5578639	5579499	No, you said Loop.
5580410	5580910	I said Lube.
5581051	5581971	Lube would be a fun name.
5582031	5584773	I don't know why they're all like, did he say the Xbox Lube?
5584893	5586775	Then it would be a smooth move.
5589357	5591218	Now I kind of like the name Xbox Lube.
5592379	5593399	We're getting you ready.
5593600	5600625	That'll be the... That'll be the... Bend over, here we come!
5600705	5601365	Bend over!
5604748	5605108	Love it.
5605248	5609291	Alright, it's now... We are now officially calling the next Xbox the Xbox Lube.
5610885	5611785	I'm feeling kind of nauseous now.
5629575	5633158	Kaijudo says, I like Xbox Blue, but the Blu-ray will slide in better.
5633438	5636360	So how about some Dragon Quest X?
5636900	5639302	If you are in the Japanese beta, you get a free hat.
5639522	5640903	Notice I said the Japanese beta.
5641483	5644385	Because it's only the beta in Japan.
5644425	5647387	You have to have a Japanese Square Enix account to be able to sign up for it.
5647467	5650129	So if you're not in Japan, it sucks to be you.
5651429	5652770	Well, it does suck anyway, but anyway.
5653430	5655191	So how about some Bioshock Infinite?
5655351	5660534	It's going to have a special move peripheral.
5661814	5669118	Well, it says it will draw you deeper into this vision of a parallel future, blah, blah, blah.
5669498	5671239	But we don't know what it is.
5672319	5673120	I bet it's a hose.
5673920	5675921	Actually, they confirmed that that's not actually happening.
5676289	5676449	No.
5676749	5677009	Okay.
5677850	5679270	Well, Saints Row, the third.
5679310	5680811	How about that dildo that you were playing with?
5681651	5682372	It was floppy.
5683312	5688154	Well, for the Japanese version, the penetrator has been censored.
5688875	5692836	The veins and physics from the dildo was meant to be removed.
5693937	5697238	Because they have stricter guidelines on how you can display a phallus.
5697458	5699839	And I think they also took out the balls as well.
5701220	5703441	I do not believe the testicles were on the penetrator.
5706217	5707639	This is very serious, Rob.
5707659	5708700	Why are you laughing?
5708720	5710782	They have effectively neutered the weapon.
5713425	5715347	It looks like a purple vibrator now.
5715367	5717809	It's totally going to throw everything off.
5719391	5725337	My favorite is that all these very serious game blogs had to report, well, yes, they had to make the dildo less veiny.
5726963	5728724	You had to take out his floppy physics.
5728744	5730825	You know what would be awesome to have?
5731905	5745971	They gave this out, and of course they can't do this out over here because it would be tasteless, but in certain other countries like Denmark and Finland or whatever, they were actually shipping them recreations of the Penetrator.
5746371	5748612	Actual size recreations of the Penetrator.
5748852	5751513	It's a giant four foot long dildo on a stick.
5752988	5753708	On a baseball bat.
5753908	5757290	On a baseball bat that these blog people had.
5757650	5759591	I would display that proudly.
5759651	5760771	I'm looking for pictures.
5762272	5763192	Go to Kotaku.
5763772	5764753	Kotaku has them.
5765433	5768234	Oh, yeah, because she's got to post them in the Orange Launch Radio Tumblr account.
5768294	5770115	So we haven't really been posting a lot over there tonight.
5770195	5771215	So here you go.
5772396	5772736	All right.
5775117	5778718	They show what it looks like in Japan, and it's... Rigid.
5779398	5779979	Very rigid.
5780039	5780619	That looks painful.
5783303	5787304	Alright, moving on to talking about... This is actually from Tumblr.
5787384	5789844	I wanted to talk about this real quick before we get into some long-form news.
5790104	5793845	Because I saw this around Twitter, and this is a nice story.
5794125	5797066	I want to share this nice story with you guys and see what you guys think about it, okay?
5797806	5802207	So, I got to abridge this because I don't want to read this verbatim.
5802667	5804267	But where is this coming from?
5804287	5808148	I think the original Tumblr user that posted this was iHeartChaos.
5808968	5809849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5829824	5833867	He actually had sold a bunch of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and did housework for his parents to get it.
5834647	5838630	And the guy who wrote this said, I had an idea, save my place in line.
5838890	5845334	And he went through the line, told other people about the situation, collected a bunch of money, five bucks here and there and so forth.
5845754	5849497	And he was able to raise the money for a new copy, bought the kid a new copy.
5849777	5852339	And the kid was very thankful about it and so forth.
5852359	5854160	And the kid said, do you need anything in return?
5854800	5860303	and the guy says, I told him, young man, I just hope one day you'll do something equally nice for someone.
5860984	5864506	So, you know, it's a very inspiring, pay it forward type of story, right?
5864566	5865867	So it's very, very nice.
5868227	5874973	I read this on Twitter and I was like, that's sweet, but I'm going to be a bitch here because there's something kind of really wrong with this story.
5875493	5876634	Did anyone else pick up on it?
5876934	5878155	Yep, I picked up on it.
5878215	5879396	What did you pick up on, Loki?
5879576	5883500	I picked up on the fact, first off, it's a child playing an M-rated game.
5883520	5884520	That's right, Loki.
5884580	5889524	I said at the very beginning, it was a 13-year-old who rolled his bike and sold his Yu-Gi-Oh cards to get the game.
5889544	5890645	Was it a midnight launch?
5890665	5891826	At a midnight launch.
5892267	5893348	Oh, his parents are wonderful.
5894308	5901735	If, now, this is going to sound really rude, but this is the point when you start to look at situations like that, do you go, is this story real?
5902696	5903717	Maybe the story's not real.
5904398	5912666	Like, and I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say, but I think I have a right to be skeptical, because what parent lets a 13-year-old ride their bike at midnight at night?
5913635	5917080	I mean, I guess there's some crazy people out there, but it does leave me positive.
5917100	5921467	Well, and see what happens when you do let your 13-year-old out at midnight.
5921887	5924692	Seriously, why are people robbing people of games?
5925873	5927296	I mean, that part's shitty.
5927376	5929599	Go steal it from a store or something.
5929719	5938644	Sadly, you know, and then there's that part and it makes me go, well, you know, that definitely could be legit that somebody's going to steal an Xbox game right out of a kid's hands.
5938704	5940204	I mean, that's really fucking classy.
5940525	5946007	But unfortunately, there's some people in this world that are just not have no class whatsoever and would do something like that.
5947308	5953731	But, you know, there's also that part of me that's like, but it's a 13-year-old trying to buy an M-rated game.
5954131	5960675	The game starts, I don't mean to be all spoilery, but within the first five minutes of playing Skyrim, you're going to see some guy get his head chopped off.
5961515	5962055	Awesome.
5962275	5963756	Old-style execution style.
5964156	5966658	And it's like, do you want your 13-year-old to see that?
5967358	5968058	Maybe not.
5968538	5970259	Like, some 13-year-olds can probably handle it.
5970279	5970720	Oh, come on.
5970820	5973421	I watched Red Sonja when I was, what, seven?
5973761	5975002	But that was your parents' choice.
5976082	5976562	No, it wasn't.
5976963	5983167	Yeah, but you didn't ride two miles in the dark at midnight to go do it.
5983287	5985408	Maybe the parents let the kid did this.
5986389	5989451	Maybe the parents let the kid did this, and that's fine, whatever, he's not my kid.
5989531	5996916	But then I go, but the store effectively allowed this perfect stranger to buy an M-rated game for a 13-year-old.
5997376	6000879	I mean, regardless of the reason, isn't that not supposed to be happening?
6001819	6002960	That is not supposed to be happening.
6002980	6003060	Yeah.
6004463	6009749	So, now my other question is, am I a bitch for my mind instantly going here?
6010610	6011851	Well, let me... Yes.
6011951	6015255	On a feel-good, warm, fuzzy-wuzzy, gamers-do-good story.
6016597	6021762	No, he didn't do good, because he basically bought the... He should have... I don't know, whatever.
6021802	6023364	His parents should have taken care of it.
6025327	6027069	So, alright.
6027129	6029192	Is it wrong that I'm color correcting this picture of a dildo?
6030433	6031294	You're just really bored.
6031614	6033957	Alright, wait a minute, you're doing a show, how can you be bored?
6033997	6034257	Alright.
6034698	6040224	Because I'm... Moving on, let's get to some more gaming news, Loki.
6040825	6043608	So, of course, you know, one of the things that...
6045871	6046993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6064355	6066116	Say I didn't want to play online.
6066356	6068777	Say I bought the game because it has System Link.
6069338	6070138	Praise System Link.
6070598	6070898	Awesome.
6071959	6075661	And I want to play with my friend over System Link.
6075881	6078022	In order for me to do that, I have to put in an online pass code.
6078122	6078462	That's right.
6079183	6086767	If I bought this game used and I had no intention to play it online at all, I wanted to play it System Link, I would have to pay $10 to get a code.
6087527	6088948	An online pass to play offline!
6090876	6091657	What is up with that?
6092238	6093419	But yes, that is the case.
6095161	6097744	They have a screenshot of the actual online passcode.
6097924	6099326	I have my own online passcode.
6100327	6102349	And yeah, you can't do it.
6102469	6107575	Oh, and of course, because the copy is early, it's not actually on the site yet.
6107775	6110458	So I can't actually play co-op with anybody yet.
6111519	6112600	But that's fucked up.
6113841	6121546	I mean, I thought the whole point of these online passes... And it's not even me calling it an online pass.
6121606	6124609	It's not like, you know, okay, this is an Ubi Uplay thing.
6124649	6126530	This is going to unlock bonus contents.
6126750	6129032	It says, your online pass code.
6130233	6137138	So if I'm not playing this online, and the whole reason that you're charging this is because online servers cost money to run, then...
6138993	6141054	Then basically you're just taking money for the hell of it.
6141934	6144194	I don't know.
6144475	6146515	I mean, you should have had System Link outside of it.
6146615	6148796	Now, here's why they don't have System Link outside of it.
6148836	6150216	Because they know this game is going to get pirated.
6150396	6156718	And they also know that there are ways that you can play online co-op with somebody else via System Link.
6158038	6184209	and that's why they put this behind a code because if they're going to at least make some money off this pirated copy if you're going to play online and play co-op whether it be through System Link or whatever then they're going to make $10 off it that's the true reason why it's like this but still for legitimate people that want to play this game say buy it used or whatever in other words it's a further case of legitimate buyers getting screwed over anti-piracy measures that will get hacked to shit anyway
6184329	6187771	Yeah, I mean, because I agree this game's awesome and you should buy it.
6188111	6192173	And, you know, if you can buy it new, great, because I think you should play it sooner than later.
6192273	6200376	But not everyone can buy it new and you shouldn't be expected to have to pony out, you know, money for something that maybe you're not sure that you'd like it or something.
6200396	6207160	Well, granted, but when you do buy the game new, you don't, I mean, we have to remember that online passes don't affect those that buy new.
6207540	6207720	Yeah.
6209121	6236323	but it still it still ain't well and actually no it does kind of affect me if buying a new because I play on a lot of different systems at work so if I want to play System Link Co-op now I can only play on my system and you know I'd have to get another copy new you can't like download the data to USB and then go to a friend's house and put the USB in there no I don't think so I think it's tied to your system it might be tied to your account you might be able to do it
6236923	6244650	But even still, though, I would have to log in online anyways to play System Link, you know, because you have to download its DLC, basically.
6244830	6247032	So DLC is usually tied to your system.
6247172	6247412	Right.
6248913	6252036	And you can't play the same account on two systems to System Link, can you?
6252517	6253257	No.
6253337	6254078	See, that's the trick.
6254698	6257281	So you are kind of getting screwed in that regard.
6258642	6258802	Yep.
6260932	6269158	Well, it's a good thing to know before the game comes out, I think, especially for people who might be considering buying it, waiting to get it used or whatever.
6269198	6270199	Well, here's the thing, though.
6270439	6272461	They didn't tell anybody it was going to have this.
6273582	6278466	It just happened to be a reviewer or whatever said, hey, it has an online pass.
6278546	6279427	It's something to report on.
6279747	6281188	They didn't tell anybody.
6281288	6283170	If that reviewer hadn't said anything...
6284262	6290565	I'm sure obviously it's going to get out there early and people would say something, but let's just say, devil's advocate here, that no one said anything.
6290846	6292106	THQ would have not said anything.
6292346	6295728	You would get home with your copy of the game and you're like, what the fuck is this?
6297269	6298429	And they already have your 60 bucks.
6298449	6301231	But now you're getting used to seeing those things in every game.
6303494	6320022	I have no problem with games that if they want to charge that because they're saying we need to fund our servers or whatever the case may be and it's an online game I have a problem with it on Xbox 360 I'm already paying $50 a month for that
6321658	6323899	Why are Microsoft games allowed to charge for this?
6324580	6328962	Now, granted, Microsoft first-party games haven't done it because they know better.
6331043	6336546	We're going to go ape shit on them when they try to pull that shit because that's true double-dipping right there.
6337086	6340188	But right now, it's really only the third parties that are doing it.
6340228	6341429	And now Sony, but Sony...
6342470	6359566	Sony's online thing is free already I give this way more justification on the Playstation than I do on the Xbox because I'm already paying $50 a month to play online on the Xbox that's kind of what pisses me off about the online pass in that regard but anyhow
6361668	6363950	Rumors abound that a new Zelda game is on its way.
6364090	6366692	It's being made for the 3DS.
6366832	6373717	Series producer Eiji Onuma talked to a Portuguese website, MyGames, and said the following, quote,
6382483	6386804	We are talking about a new game, but it takes much of what has been done on previous handhelds.
6387224	6390425	Some folks are saying, is this sort of Majora's Mask?
6390865	6392165	I'm actually thinking no.
6392325	6398807	I think, you know, I'm kind of reading really a lot into this, but I think it's definitely a new Zelda title, which kind of seems like a duh.
6398827	6400487	There's going to be the major Nintendo franchises.
6400847	6403128	But look at everything that's kind of been leading up to this.
6403168	6411730	You know, Nintendo has been talking about, yeah, we need more big releases on the 3DS, and we have some things that are coming in 2012 that we're not ready to announce yet.
6412290	6417596	I think Zelda 3DS is probably the big thing that's being unveiled next E3 on the 3DS.
6418697	6419618	I mean, duh, right?
6422581	6427587	It's gonna be some big first-party game, and if they're gonna refuse to give me F-Zero another year...
6429368	6444881	Then it's going to be probably Zelda Most likely This doesn't surprise me at all And I don't want it to be Majora's Mask I get that some people want that remade too, whatever, fine But I think I'd rather just have a new Zelda game Why not a new experience?
6447082	6453588	The Mario game's apparently pretty good So they're capable of taking the old franchises and making them fun in 3D Why not Zelda?
6455549	6457291	I'm sure it'll be a new game It'll be cool
6458570	6460151	Hopefully it won't take five years to develop.
6460772	6461292	We'll see though.
6462092	6462973	Let's get to the mailbag.
6463994	6475581	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag and pick out the one email that came in this week that's worth reading.
6475841	6476802	All the rest of it is spam.
6478283	6485465	Mailbag at OrangeDanceRadio.com I realize a lot of you have been busy playing Modern Warfare and Skyrim and Mario and so forth, but let's make her work next week.
6486465	6489226	No opinions on the panel tonight about Modern Warfare.
6489366	6490747	I need emails on Modern Warfare.
6491367	6494328	Tell me why this sold 9 million copies or whatever the first day.
6494508	6495248	I need to understand.
6495848	6499369	I'm not hating on the game, I just want to know... I'm not hating on it.
6499629	6500190	It's just not my...
6502526	6505108	I want to know why other people get so riled up about it.
6531049	6533390	Thanks guys, Sundays are orange forever, Jim Sally
6551520	6555964	I would say the best holiday deal I ever got was my HDTV for $600.
6556024	6558066	Keep in mind this was in the year, I think, 2004.
6559447	6560328	I got it at Costco.
6560428	6562550	And it was back when HDTVs were not flat.
6563351	6565953	They had the giant backs like the old school TVs still.
6566053	6567594	That thing was heavy as hell.
6568515	6569917	That was a big TV.
6570057	6575202	Did I get that when I was living with you, Loki, or was that when I was living with Extifer that I finally got that?
6576516	6580538	But that was only $600, which then was like dirt cheap for an HDTV.
6580578	6582799	I don't know if you remember that TV, DarkSakura.
6583079	6584680	You know where you can see that TV?
6586481	6591204	It's in the news report that Channel 3 did on us that somebody put up on YouTube.
6592124	6594225	You're playing DDR on that old TV.
6594245	6594586	Let me see.
6594786	6595226	Yeah.
6597711	6599152	This is a good time to revisit that music too.
6599172	6602154	I thought I was playing DVR on... You were playing on the cabinet.
6602495	6603115	On the cabinet.
6603435	6604316	You were playing on the cabinet.
6604796	6605177	No, no, no.
6605217	6606558	That was when the B did the article.
6606598	6612883	That was the Sacramento B. Well, the one with the rock band, not rock band, but guitar hero was here at my house.
6613283	6613643	No, no.
6613823	6615965	He's talking about the... On my old TV.
6616125	6620268	Don't you remember the It's So Much Fun story?
6620348	6621649	It's So Much Fun.
6621689	6622890	That led to that whole thing.
6622930	6623611	Don't you remember that?
6625700	6626420	Oh, look, I found it.
6626440	6627021	I found it.
6627101	6627921	It's still on YouTube.
6627941	6628761	Look at this.
6628781	6632402	The governor is one of the many people joining the podcasting craze.
6632482	6635163	It's becoming a web craze, but what is it?
6635303	6635863	How does it work?
6635943	6643506	KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share their thoughts with the world.
6646648	6653572	It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game There, there's the ginormous TV, remember that guy?
6653712	6672161	I got that for 600 bucks, I was a steal back then October 9th, 2006, but anyway, now that I have this up I was thinking of the Vega, but the Vega was, um, dude's TV Now that we're, this is a five year old clip now, now I want to watch the rest No, I don't want to watch it It started off tiny and it's grown
6675290	6676071	That's what she said.
6678553	6679593	No, we're not playing this.
6679914	6681415	No, I gotta hear that again.
6682075	6684157	It started off tiny and it's grown.
6685157	6686899	A subculture of pop culture.
6687239	6690542	And these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming fans.
6690562	6691462	A cliche thing.
6691502	6692683	That's a cliche thing.
6692703	6694665	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
6696101	6705465	Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to another... Remember that ginormous green chair we had randomly in the old studio in the Extifer apartment?
6705665	6706965	The one I would sleep in sometimes?
6706985	6708586	Oh my god, that chair is gigantic.
6708626	6709006	Anyway, sorry.
6709046	6710687	...episode of our podcast.
6711067	6714829	From their apartment in Rancho Cordova, using revolutionary technology...
6715709	6716330	Oh my god.
6716350	6718252	That was my old laptop that's in the garage now.
6718452	6720134	Look how young we are in this picture.
6720314	6721296	Especially look at Loki.
6721936	6723478	He looks so much younger in this clip.
6723919	6724599	And I had hair.
6725040	6725541	It's amazing.
6725581	6726241	I look the same.
6726261	6727363	Maybe we'll do that to you.
6727803	6728724	Except your hair is shorter.
6729025	6730226	And it's a different color.
6732128	6737933	basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really want to know.
6738353	6744959	Using a computer, podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.
6745460	6753546	Now anyone can create, edit, and air their ideas, concerns, music, and all things audio to anyone else willing to download it.
6753767	6754988	It's something they can take with them.
6755368	6758631	It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.
6759141	6763907	With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.
6764147	6767992	I love that they just interviewed some random dude bro, like who had his iPod with him.
6768072	6769413	He's skating down the street.
6769454	6774980	Now people can talk about things they like to talk about and other people can join in and listen to.
6775060	6776142	And it's really open and...
6779030	6781831	A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free.
6782031	6785893	The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes.
6786653	6793696	You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature, and a list of available podcasts are at your fingertips.
6794096	6797918	Free for you, free for the producers, free speech for everyone.
6798538	6799518	Oh, it's so much fun.
6799738	6800259	It's great.
6800319	6802820	Yeah, they can go eat a dick, okay?
6804160	6817149	interview me for a minute and a half let's play this two second clip they never show Loki's name, his real name they never show anything but that one little clip, oh it's so much fun and then me talking about something a little more profound
6818117	6819038	Free for the producers.
6819398	6820939	Free speech for everyone.
6821839	6822520	It's so much fun.
6822760	6829224	It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.
6829304	6831026	So podcasting is just wonderful.
6831666	6834988	Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 Reports.
6835729	6837290	I got to say more than everybody.
6837310	6838290	That was kind of cool.
6838330	6841793	...began providing his weekly radio address as a podcast.
6842093	6847537	It can be downloaded so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're pumping iron.
6848758	6852120	That's right, we were mentioned in the same breath as Governor Schwarzenegger.
6852161	6854442	Yes, he really was the governor of California, if you weren't aware.
6854503	6856124	He really, really was the governor.
6856344	6858986	Did you notice that overhead cam shot trying to get my boobs?
6860628	6861268	Seriously!
6861288	6862429	That cameraman fancied you.
6863110	6864591	Whatever, it's just because I'm a girl.
6865972	6870496	And by the way, here's my favorite thing about that whole story.
6871197	6872278	Our show is never named.
6874301	6877425	They don't want to have free advertising.
6877765	6881889	But when you watch him search, he's searching for Orange Lounge Radio.
6881929	6883151	That was the shout out we got.
6883751	6887015	But never did they say, these three guys produce a show called Orange Lounge Radio.
6887375	6890159	Nope, they play DDR and it's so much fun.
6890619	6892982	It started off tiny and it's grown.
6895970	6910863	Cutting Edge Technology These failed things called computers These guys are doing what Governor Schwarzenegger's doing Pumping iron Doing drugs Making poor decisions
6915126	6916327	All right, let's move on.
6916927	6917788	Is that it for emails?
6918708	6919809	Oh, holiday deals.
6919949	6924252	We took a trip down memory lane and just totally ignored Jim Sally's question.
6924272	6924872	There's no more emails.
6924893	6925933	Well, I mentioned the TV.
6926313	6928735	Did anybody else get any really good holiday deals that they can remember?
6928755	6929415	I don't remember.
6929435	6929776	I don't care.
6930736	6944046	Um, I used to buy like, uh, different like media and stuff, you know, like CD blanks and stuff like that because you usually have, uh, some good deals on those at least during the holidays.
6944206	6947068	That was the only thing I could see you like going to like Best Buy or something for.
6949139	6949479	All right.
6950620	6954421	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us some emails in the future.
6954621	6954901	All right.
6954961	6959043	After that trip down memory lane, I'm sure that's going to ignite some fury amongst some people.
6959483	6961264	It's a part of the show we call the FUs of the Week.
6981780	6982401	I don't know.
6983043	6984306	It gets us to feeling crappy.
6985563	6987145	Yeah, F you to Feeling Crappy.
6987545	6988466	And F you to Shane.
6990308	6991409	Why is he getting an F you?
6991469	6999557	Because I've listened to a lot of Manson, and every time, I can't help it, he's got me liking a group that I can't get any new stuff from anymore.
7000397	7002419	Oh yeah, didn't they break up years ago?
7002439	7005322	Years ago, but I just recently heard of them thanks to him.
7005342	7006423	Didn't someone from that group die too?
7006884	7009146	I don't know, but I'm mad at Shane.
7010687	7011608	Only marginally.
7011708	7014730	I'm also mad at Shane for not catching up on Supernatural.
7015850	7017351	So I can't talk to him about it.
7017891	7018192	Sorry.
7018532	7023114	I love our chat room because we were talking about the similarities between Orange Launch Radio and Governor Schwarzenegger, right?
7023815	7026857	Kasson in the chat says, which one of the OLR hosts diddled the maid?
7027937	7033758	and SalaciousPop follows that up saying, is OLR going to suddenly reveal a 10-year-old offspring from a Latina domestic servant?
7034018	7035779	Because that's something Governor Schwarzenegger did.
7036039	7037119	The show is the right age.
7037499	7039380	We got really drunk after our second episode.
7039440	7040460	Don't ask how this happened.
7040480	7045161	Hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, physically capable of that, so shut up.
7045621	7047481	No, Loki or I could have boinked a maid.
7048582	7051722	But, oh, that's right, I'm not a Latina maid.
7052743	7054243	You definitely are not a Latina maid.
7056487	7057667	Alright, FUs of the week.
7058027	7059508	Loki.
7059728	7068671	I would say my FU goes to those people I'm not sure if you've seen these but they have these little signs that show how fast you're going and stuff like that.
7069191	7072673	It's kind of a reminder to do the speed limit or under the speed limit.
7072733	7075354	I always, always speed up when I see those.
7075994	7079517	Well, I see people, like, see those signs and they, like, slam on their brakes.
7079597	7081878	I'm like, dude, it's a fucking sign.
7081958	7083219	It's not gonna write you a ticket.
7083359	7084180	It's a sign.
7084580	7087402	That's all it does, is it shows you how fast you're going.
7087702	7089303	And not accurately, by the way.
7089704	7095308	My favorite thing to find out with those signs is how high it will track you before it starts getting angry and starts blinking.
7096128	7099911	Like, I always like to see, like, what's the speed limit where it starts flashing slow down, asshole?
7100805	7106851	So, yeah, so I feed those people that think signs are real, people that are gonna, you know, write them tickets or something.
7106911	7108192	It doesn't have a magical camera on it.
7108212	7110394	I'm sure someday the signs will be able to write you a ticket.
7111915	7113377	Governments are hard up enough for the money.
7113937	7114257	I guess.
7114898	7118221	Alright, my FU of the week goes to the headache I had today.
7119182	7124527	Because headaches are terrible, and, yeah, it made me want to nap all day, forever.
7125544	7126505	Make you feel better, Rob?
7126685	7128166	What, the giant purple dildo?
7128406	7128666	No.
7129787	7130968	It does not make me feel better.
7132889	7133629	I kind of want one.
7135331	7136511	I'd hang it up in the studio.
7136792	7137172	Sure.
7137632	7138052	I would.
7138933	7139273	All right.
7139774	7141074	Let's move on with some more stories.
7141094	7143176	The Skype line coming up soon, but first, more news.
7143256	7143536	Loki.
7143696	7146438	Studio, sex dungeon, same difference.
7147719	7154463	So, apparently, you know, we were talking a little bit about online passes and stuff, and one of the things that the online passes,
7155484	7157185	if you want to call them that.
7157545	7163089	Drew is basically to deter used game sales.
7164290	7171815	But there's a report that's out that's saying that basically used and digital sales actually make up about 35% of total console spending.
7172135	7185124	And that's very, you know, it makes sense with a lot of the stuff nowadays available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace or the PlayStation Network or even the WiiWare stores and Steam and whatever.
7186005	7188688	It's not surprising that it would be about that much.
7189409	7196778	They're also saying that 23% of the console games purchased in the U.S.
7197379	7202185	are used, and slightly more than the European market where it's about 20%.
7203767	7224916	also digitally distributed titles rank lower in both regions I guess taking up 12% of console market in America and 9% in Europe and also I guess they're saying that the 12% that actually is approximately $960 million worth of content that's being purchased right there
7227078	7233744	and they're saying also 54% of American console owners are spending an average of $49 a year on console downloads.
7238007	7244791	And then, of course, talking a little bit about PC, and you would kind of think that PC is going to be skewing more towards the digital side.
7245451	7246331	Actually, that is true.
7246512	7252215	They're saying that 58% of all PC gaming dollars are spent digitally on games or DLC.
7253295	7254876	So that's the way it's going in the PC market.
7255237	7257358	Not so much in the console market.
7257378	7261140	I'm not surprised because you see PC retail shelves really drying up.
7261160	7262321	It's not a surprise at all.
7262921	7264262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7289753	7294014	I'm actually going to talk to people I know to take it apart and see about fixing the DVD player.
7294294	7295095	Nice.
7295475	7298095	And seeing what I can do to get Linux on it.
7298115	7299636	To make it do your evil bidding?
7299936	7308058	There's a version of Linux that's meant to run on a Mac and mirror Mac OS, only use a lot less memory and be a lot more efficient.
7308178	7309578	Then she's going to install the grid on it.
7310518	7310838	End of line.
7310858	7311899	And then I'll move in.
7312759	7313039	Alright.
7316237	7342904	but anyhow only 35% you would think with all these online passes and everything it was much higher it doesn't seem so bad no because I think the majority of you know because you're looking at dollars and the majority of the stuff that's purchased online would be cheaper and also a lot more people are you know lining up to go to the stores to buy stuff and also not a lot of stuff is like day and date with you know games on you don't have it yet where you can buy
7343784	7352490	Call of Duty at midnight as a digital download and I would be willing to bet if they did that you'd probably see a lot of people going that route.
7352610	7360035	Well, Steam did launch Skyrim where you could preload the game and then you unencrypt it at midnight.
7360715	7363477	They did do that for Skyrim and I think they've done it for other big games too.
7363637	7369721	Steam does that a lot but I'm saying as far as console stuff goes you don't see that.
7371690	7373213	That's true, you don't see consoles yet.
7374134	7375276	Yet.
7375616	7385252	Wait for the Xbox Lube, because it's going to give the Lube, it's going to Lube up GameStop, because I bet a lot of these new consoles are going to go very, very heavy on digital distribution.
7387233	7388173	GameStop can bend over.
7388814	7389074	All right.
7390515	7391055	What, you all right?
7392015	7392215	Nothing.
7392295	7393916	I'm just listening to what Dan's playing.
7394116	7394376	All right.
7394516	7395117	What is he playing?
7395597	7396237	Saints Row III.
7396517	7396877	Oh, nice.
7397318	7397558	All right.
7398898	7399359	Moving on.
7400419	7404121	One of the biggest complaints about the Wii U when it was announced to E3 this year is what?
7404781	7412745	All the games will only work with the one controller, because I guess the system was not capable when they showed it at E3 of running games on multiple controllers.
7412765	7420029	Because you know the touchscreens, the device is basically processing the screen and what you're seeing on the TV.
7420449	7423890	And so it was worrisome that you wouldn't be able to run multiple controllers.
7423970	7424651	Well, however...
7425311	7435522	Apparently, some stuff is going on behind the scenes where they might actually be retooling the Wii U to work with multiple of those consoles.
7436283	7446473	I guess there's an article on developonline.net that talks about Nintendo now knows they absolutely need to support two tablets.
7447134	7452857	At E3, they didn't commit to this, but they know how important it is to make technically feasible to support two screens.
7453357	7456579	Even if that affects frame rate, as a developer and player, I don't care.
7456699	7457420	It needs to work.
7457800	7460061	Developers will design appropriate games for this.
7460501	7463923	If you're building a quiz game, you're not going to give a shit about the frame rate.
7464684	7470226	Hmm, so apparently Nintendo is being pressured by developers to get this to work.
7471867	7473388	Could it end up delaying the whole system?
7474269	7474589	Maybe.
7475498	7477779	Loki, you've already speculated the Wii U is not coming out next year.
7478779	7479659	I wouldn't be surprised.
7480240	7481740	I wouldn't be surprised if it's 2013.
7482981	7487222	How is Nintendo going to... I mean, I was going to say, how is Nintendo going to recover next year?
7487382	7493044	But we're hearing reports that 3DS sales are going way up because of Mario 3D Land, at least over in Japan.
7493304	7494465	Well, I mean, it'll help.
7495125	7499607	And definitely what they're going to have next year will help.
7499687	7499847	But...
7502890	7507535	I just, that new system just sounds so broken right now.
7507936	7510499	I mean, they have nothing to show for it yet.
7510839	7513782	I mean, some tech demos that are basically Wii games.
7513943	7515104	It's been six months.
7515364	7517326	It's probably a lot further along than what we saw at E3.
7517346	7518808	It's going to be a lot, lot
7518928	7520829	further, further along next E3.
7521090	7523632	So I don't think it's a done deal yet.
7523732	7528936	I think Nintendo knows that people were not as thrilled with Wii U as they were with the 3DS.
7528996	7533119	And I think come next E3, they're really prepared to just blow us away.
7534540	7545628	And I think some hardcore developers getting up on that stage, some third-party developers gonna get up there and show, you know, Saints Row 4 or something on the Wii U and how it's, you know, the technology is amazing or whatever.
7546268	7548210	And obviously I'm just picking that because I know it'll
7550476	7551436	It'll get you interested.
7551856	7552137	Alright.
7553057	7553277	No.
7553797	7553977	No?
7554658	7556339	Are you no way know-how buying a Wii U?
7557039	7560841	No, I wouldn't say that, but I'm just saying I'm not... He's gonna steal one.
7561961	7562802	Steal one, please.
7563222	7567504	No, I'm not gonna... It's not something that right now I need to have.
7568764	7572766	GameGuru in our chatroom says, Yeah, the GameCube could support four GBAs.
7573187	7573267	Mmm...
7574167	7574487	and DarkSakura.
7590787	7594068	The box is streaming the image to your tablet.
7594168	7600891	It does have some processing power to those tablets, but they can't put a lot of processing power in there because they've got to keep the price down.
7601871	7609514	But maybe that's something they might have to put more oomph in those tablets and make them more expensive.
7609634	7612956	What they should have done is they should delay this shit for another few years.
7613036	7615917	When the price of those components comes down, then you can do that.
7616477	7619901	Yeah, but those tablets are essentially the lower half of a DS.
7620382	7621703	How expensive can those be now?
7622044	7623225	DSs are $79.
7625307	7627910	I mean, like the lowest-end DS is $79.
7628131	7630053	You can't tell me that technology is that expensive.
7630313	7632035	We're already expecting those tablets are going to be $100 a pop.
7636022	7657468	I don't know so all I know is I think it's a big old gimmick and I'm still not buying into it yet it's a fucking Wii with slightly better graphics and a goddamn tablet that's what's that tablet gonna do for me oh it's gonna stream some shit on it okay great you know this is shit that could have been on the screen oh but we're moving the inventory okay I why should I spend $100 on a tablet
7659569	7670377	Because, you know, to be neat, you're going to put the inventory screen on this tablet instead of having push start to pop the inventory screen up.
7670637	7671718	I mean, who gives a shit?
7671738	7683147	But we're going to make our frame rate and stuff drop because we really need this inventory screen to not be... Once again, and this also goes to the Kinect too...
7684787	7686529	Why can't I just do things the old way?
7686709	7689331	Why can't I just push a button, inventory screen pops up?
7689911	7693134	Why do I need the map always on the bottom of the screen?
7693154	7696177	If you want the map on the bottom of the screen, put it in the corner of the screen and be done with it.
7696557	7698719	Why do I need the shout grenade to throw a grenade?
7698939	7699559	You don't have to.
7699740	7705625	I know I don't have to, but that's the thing though, is in these games, why do I have to waggle my controller to throw a grenade?
7705865	7706886	Why can't I just push a button?
7707106	7707786	It's stupid.
7708627	7726342	just because you can doesn't mean you should all they have to do is get up on that stage and say brand new F-Zero game coming to Wii U and I pre-ordered that's all they would have to do and you're part of the problem I am absolutely part of the problem but it's F-Zero, Loki it's the best GameCube game they had rah
7726974	7728875	You have to understand, Rob, those times are gone.
7729776	7732818	They don't give a shit about F-Zero anymore, and if they do, it's gonna suck.
7732838	7734639	Why are you so mean, Loki?
7735559	7739102	Next thing you're gonna tell me the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus aren't real.
7740002	7740603	Uh, Rob?
7740943	7741183	What?
7741463	7741783	They're not.
7744778	7745138	DarkSakura.com
7765133	7772817	Well, the virtual console release of Super Street Fighter 2 on Genesis in Japan has Wi-Fi.
7773517	7774358	So did Puyo Puyo.
7775298	7782221	But while we're getting the game, Street Fighter is not... No, yeah, it is.
7782341	7785843	It's actually going to have the Wi-Fi capability.
7785863	7787164	So that's kind of cool.
7788324	7789084	But why not Puyo Puyo?
7790526	7791306	Why not other stuff?
7792266	7794407	Because, unfortunately, Street Fighter is Street Fighter.
7794427	7799028	Well, I mean, not unfortunately, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter, and everybody likes Street Fighter.
7799568	7801329	Only some people have even heard of Puyo Puyo.
7801629	7803209	But Street Fighter 2 is huge.
7803769	7805710	We should be able to play people anywhere.
7805870	7813312	But, I mean, yay for Virtual Console finally getting some online play capability about five years too late.
7814651	7816253	Also, did you hear about how they're doing this?
7816293	7820217	They're doing it through emulation of that... Oh, God, I forgot the name of it.
7820257	7821258	The X-Mode?
7822039	7823121	What the fuck was that thing?
7823181	7824602	The X... No.
7825243	7825864	Now I forget.
7826184	7827225	Somebody in chat will yell it out.
7827265	7828947	That online Genesis thing, right?
7829027	7830309	No, not the Sega channel.
7830889	7834333	But it was Genesis and it was Super Nintendo.
7834974	7835274	An X...
7836695	7836916	Oh!
7837356	7844161	And you could plug it in, and it sat between your cartridge and the console, and you could dial into this network and play people.
7844181	7846383	It was like an old, old, old-ass version of Xbox Live.
7846403	7847724	I know what you're talking about.
7847804	7848724	I thought that's the name of it.
7849225	7850025	That's stupid.
7850225	7851667	Somebody in Chow shot it.
7851707	7853068	We don't want to do any work.
7853088	7854549	Let's just emulate this old shit.
7854589	7856070	That's what they're doing to make it work.
7856410	7857311	It's too stupid.
7859012	7860513	We have to build an emulator.
7861094	7862775	If they can do it in Japan, why can't they do it here?
7864526	7886840	that's what they're doing in Japan is they're using that emulation to do it of course I'm believing everything I read on the internet so it might not actually be true but it wouldn't surprise me at all so just silly yeah X-Band thank you chatters who said that first X-Band Orange Wright said it first
7890600	7891641	have you ever seen the X-Band?
7893023	7902755	I think only like 7,000 of them were ever sold here's a picture of it oh that's a tiny picture but that's all I got but you can kind of see how it like sits between the cartridge and the console plug it in
7904409	7905229	Expand, thank you.
7906270	7907610	All right, Loki, what do you got for us?
7908290	7910851	All right, let's talk about Modern Warfare.
7911071	7912731	I know, we're saving the best for last, right?
7913692	7918813	No, Modern Warfare 3, of course, not surprisingly, broke all sorts of records.
7919473	7927876	It had the biggest launch ever for a game, and it sold 6.5 million units in one day.
7928536	7931497	And that's both in our total from US and UK.
7931517	7931697	Okay.
7933938	7941353	and of course they're saying that they were estimating 9 million units but
7943174	7944334	I'd say give it a couple weeks.
7946455	7950716	And of course, that puts the revenue for that game so far at $400 million.
7951176	7960738	And the previous record, of course, was $310 million last year with Black Ops.
7960918	7965500	And of course, or I'm sorry, with Modern Warfare 2 it was $310 million, Black Ops was $360 million.
7967597	7991128	so next year with whatever the fuck they come out with it'll be higher than that because people buy into this crap and not to say it's a bad game but it's a lot of people buying that game what draws everybody to this series popularity I think it's mob mentality friends
7993015	7994516	I don't know what draws people to World of Warcraft.
7994536	7995156	They are pretty.
7995356	7996236	I've seen them.
7996296	7997016	Friends, you're right.
7997076	7998297	Social aspect, absolutely.
7998537	8000658	And definitely that's something they built up this time.
8001178	8002158	Yeah, it's true.
8003699	8005119	All right, last story for you guys.
8005179	8006460	Oh, I know what draws people to it.
8006580	8010181	It's because of the fact that little kids get to play this game because their parents suck.
8011421	8012142	They let them go out.
8012222	8013022	I don't think that's it.
8013462	8013822	Oh, really?
8013842	8015523	Yeah, I would... How many...
8016563	8022987	How much do you want to bet that about 1 million of that 3.6 million sold is probably people under the age of 13?
8024688	8026049	I don't know about 13.
8026129	8028110	Under the age of 18, maybe.
8029631	8030611	Definitely under the age of 18.
8030651	8032493	17-year-olds and 16-year-olds, I believe it.
8032613	8034474	Under the age of 15.
8035354	8036015	I guarantee it.
8037015	8038276	1 million at least.
8039537	8039817	All right.
8040464	8041806	Moving on to one more story.
8041846	8043688	Then we're going to get to Twitter topics.
8043768	8047653	Twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8047693	8049676	And this is about another series that's being worked on.
8050096	8056164	This is kind of a duh, but it's probably nice to hear that Gran Turismo 6, yep, it's underway.
8056224	8056985	It's being developed.
8057005	8057826	Of course it is!
8058046	8059547	We'll come out for another eight years.
8060228	8062930	But isn't it nice to know that it's being worked on?
8063311	8068315	And I guess this is coming from Kazunori Yamauchi, who's the creator of the Gran Turismo franchise.
8068615	8070777	He's the president of Polyphony Digital.
8071238	8077003	And he actually, I guess, was at the Specialty Equipment Market Association Industry Trade Show in Las Vegas.
8077023	8078404	Because where else do trade shows happen?
8078985	8081987	And was talking a lot about some of the recent developments to Gran Turismo 5.
8082688	8083588	Thank you for watching!
8111502	8112402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8134947	8140532	Saints Row the Thirds dominate a lot of conversation tonight or maybe have something else that you think needs a shout out.
8140552	8143415	1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.
8144035	8145897	For everybody else, you probably want to use Skype.
8146077	8148780	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8149280	8150842	Skype us, baby, Skype us.
8151062	8153704	Meanwhile, just tell us, oh, it's so much fun.
8154865	8157608	Twitter.com slash OLR, getting to some tweets tonight.
8157948	8159690	We'll start off with a tweet from Redertainment.
8160612	8187588	Considering all the AAA games coming out in the next couple of weeks I'm wondering if there's a bank with good rates on credit cards No, there is not The answer to your question is no I guess my real answer, even though I get the tongue-in-cheekness of your question The real answer would be it depends on your credit score The all-important credit score is what's going to determine who's going to give you good rates Because if your credit score is really bad Then the only way you're going to get a credit card is what's called a secured credit card
8187908	8189270	Hey, this is X-Link What's on your mind, buddy?
8213629	8216755	Hey, I just wanted to say Modern Warfare 3 was pretty decent.
8216815	8221324	Actually, I'm not really all into first-person shooters, but I actually loved playing it.
8221364	8224831	I was playing with a roommate of mine, and we loved playing the co-op.
8224871	8225632	It was a lot of fun.
8226161	8226982	What do you do in the game?
8227022	8230145	You just go through and shoot terrorists in the face?
8230185	8237251	Yeah, well, there's a co-op called, it's like a mission type mode where they give you different little missions to go through.
8237491	8247420	And one of the favorite ones we were doing was, I can't think of the name of it right off the bat, I think it's like the fifth or sixth one down, like in the third or fourth mission, like the second tier set of missions.
8248241	8250463	And basically because
8251975	8254977	I was the second player and my roommate was the first.
8255337	8265044	If he was the first player, you would actually try to get him off the base, but you're controlling the torrents that we're hacking into.
8265685	8267966	So one person will play at the hacked torrent.
8268147	8274071	Basically, you can sit there and mow down all the enemies as you're trying to get him to run through to the other side of the base.
8274151	8274671	It's pretty decent.
8275914	8281298	X-Link, I'm actually really interested to hear that you're into this game because I know you and I usually play a lot of the same types of games.
8281378	8284461	We both play WoW an awful lot, in fact, way more than we probably should.
8284841	8291586	You know, we play a lot of the same type of puzzly games on Steam and so forth, but, you know, you are actually kind of jumping into Modern Warfare.
8291686	8297271	Now, I, for one, am terrible at first-person shooters, so how hard is a game like Modern Warfare for someone like me?
8298792	8298932	It's
8299898	8302519	I personally, I suck at first-person shooters myself.
8302659	8307261	I'm usually the one who's running into a room full of 15 enemies to try to mow them all down one time.
8307301	8310963	I'm basically the copycat of the noob from the commercial, basically.
8311063	8313844	I'm just, like, boring around, doing anything I pretty much could see.
8313904	8316265	I don't really take my time, and I hide behind walls and stuff.
8319268	8323531	I guess I'm really bad at that because I'm so used to, I guess, Grand Theft Auto.
8323651	8324752	Or Quake.
8324772	8327854	That's how you play Quake.
8327894	8332618	That will always be my favorite first-person shooter is Quake because there was no such thing as cover.
8333039	8344748	Then again, like I said before, I take you back to the Quake and stuff like that and back to my days like being a rogue and just going around and pretty much popping up behind people and killing them.
8344788	8346009	Good times.
8346775	8349697	You know, I liked it personally.
8349837	8350717	I thought it was a lot of fun.
8350737	8352738	The graphics were very, very cool to look at.
8352779	8353899	It was very updated.
8354800	8360363	The only thing that I got a problem with any of these games now, it's like, they're always talking about making the next one.
8360423	8362484	It's like, how did they ever one-up what they did?
8362524	8375552	Like, seriously, like, I remember playing games and, like, getting used to, like, more, like, say, for example, Mario, like, going from Mario World to, like, Mario 64 and seeing the graphics change and ever, and seeing this process of evolution constantly going through.
8375632	8375932	It's like,
8376721	8384829	What's going to be, like, how far is it going to be from now on before they hit that brick wall, so to speak, before they can't go any further than they do?
8401264	8402044	Get ready for it.
8402064	8403205	You already have holograms.
8403485	8405866	Hey, if I can get in the holodeck in my wheelchair, I'm there.
8419660	8422281	Last week I called it the Bobby show and I was talking about Skyrim.
8422441	8430423	And I fortunately, because of the situation which you and Jamie are familiar with, with my roommate, and I'm going to get all that on the show.
8430523	8431444	Personal drama.
8432384	8433604	We'll just say personal drama.
8435325	8439246	Well, long story short, I got fucked over $1,500 from my ex-roommate.
8439766	8440306	Bottom line.
8440727	8443387	And that caused a lot of problems from the beginning to the end.
8443467	8445628	And unfortunately, I was really looking forward to Skyrim.
8445668	8446588	I had it pre-ordered.
8446648	8448529	I had a lot of money down on it.
8449264	8452227	and, unfortunately, I had to cancel it last minute because of other priorities.
8452468	8457293	So, because of that, instead, I went to Redbox, tried to run what I could.
8457373	8459235	Unfortunately, I still wanted to play something a little more new.
8459615	8461377	And, of course, Skyrim.
8461678	8462238	I forgot.
8462298	8462999	I was being stupid.
8463039	8463820	I go there on a Thursday.
8463840	8465522	I'm like, okay, I'm going to go get Skyrim.
8465642	8467464	Not thinking that it came out the following day.
8468705	8469266	And, because it's
8470293	8498645	because of it I decided to get Modern Warfare 3 because Modern Warfare 3 was the closest one around the corner so I got that instead which was a little disappointing by any means because I was very blown away by it well you'll get to play Skyrim eventually and you know personal life stuff's more important and you know unfortunately that whole situation's kind of crappy but you'll get through it so yeah I will and you know I'm very patient I was the same way with Fallout and though I really was kind of pissed at um
8499948	8502109	Thanks so much for calling in and telling us about Modern Warfare.
8502129	8502549	Take care, buddy.
8527136	8530425	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio
8532483	8534524	He made Modern Warfare sound.
8534684	8535604	Basically, it's pretty.
8536364	8540185	You're oogling the prettiness, and then you shoot bad guys in the face.
8541185	8546766	Going to more tweets, twitter.com slash orange lounge, or excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR.
8547867	8549567	We have a couple links from Tigerclaw.
8550067	8551047	Oh, yeah, the trailer.
8551067	8554368	He linked us to the trailer for the Phoenix Wright live action movie.
8554408	8555228	Did you guys see this?
8555648	8557849	There's actually a trailer out there on the interwebs.
8558810	8560216	I think I saw some of this.
8564827	8565927	I will totally watch this.
8566008	8568208	And they've even got the guy's hairs all right.
8571390	8577312	My favorite is... It's totally accurate.
8579413	8581574	I love that they have the style from the games.
8584595	8585675	I will totally watch it.
8585695	8587296	That's going to be like 20 kinds of awesome.
8587376	8590537	Oh, she's even wearing the thingy.
8591670	8596953	Hey, it's your one and only local convention whore, DJ Ranma S
8608680	8612081	Um, friends out there and a girlfriend.
8612101	8612701	What can I say?
8613161	8614022	Oh, I see.
8614082	8614782	You did it for pussy.
8614842	8615222	It's alright.
8615862	8616822	Alright.
8618303	8619663	Rob, let me ask you something.
8619883	8621343	What have you done for ass?
8621464	8621744	Okay?
8621764	8623004	Okay?
8628163	8628683	No comment.
8628784	8629064	Alright.
8629084	8630505	Alright then.
8631266	8633427	You're just as bad as a whore as me, okay?
8633447	8633808	Hey, wait.
8633828	8635028	No, no, no.
8635349	8636309	I'm settled down now.
8636730	8638091	Those days are long behind me.
8638711	8639212	Same here.
8639952	8640253	Alright.
8640513	8642494	So anyhow, how was the con that you went to?
8643855	8644536	It was fun.
8644636	8648419	I mean, the best part is you look across the waterfront, you see Canada.
8649700	8650100	Nice.
8652022	8654003	You're like, oh, better places.
8654184	8654444	Alright.
8655444	8656065	and DarkSakura.
8671061	8675542	If that was me, my mother would have tanned my high and I'd be hanging from a tree right now.
8675903	8678263	But it's different from when you and I were growing up.
8679164	8680724	Ranma, the same way.
8681164	8683725	My mother, oh my god, she would have lost her shit.
8683985	8684965	She would have lost her shit.
8685085	8693648	Although, she had such fear instilled in me that she had me convinced that there were like rabid dogs waiting outside to chew my face off if I ever tried to sneak out of the house.
8693708	8696189	I mean, you know, she slept with one eye open.
8696789	8697189	True.
8697769	8699730	But on the same token though, I mean...
8700765	8728179	being in the schools for about a year I don't really see these 12 and 13 year olds being at a GameStop or at a Best Buy at midnight by themselves if they're with friends picking up the game that's believable but by yourself on a bike I don't see that I'm going to go ask Dan how many 13 year olds showed up at his midnight releases I'll be right back DarkSakura's for an M rated game what was the other thing you wanted to mention
8729162	8733524	I wanted to pick at Loki for a comment he said last week.
8734084	8734424	Okay.
8734744	8737065	Loki has to pay for something he said last week.
8737105	8737525	What's that?
8738646	8740046	His comment about Skylanders.
8740586	8740886	Okay.
8741807	8750230	I mean, I understand where he's coming from about how silly the game is and how kids want their parents to get that game.
8750570	8754752	Without divulging too much information, I understand where he's coming from with that.
8754772	8755552	But on the same token...
8756940	8757401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8778789	8779229	Wow.
8779670	8780671	Wow.
8780791	8781751	With their parents or no?
8782712	8784614	Do we find that out?
8784954	8788557	And no, I won't be doing that for my son because I'm not going to buy him stupid shit like that.
8790318	8792180	All the games have to pass the dad test.
8792480	8795783	Well, no, he won't be playing crappy games like Skylanders, please.
8797254	8797995	I have no problem...
8824429	8829254	I have no problem if he wants to play, you know, like a Connectimals or something like that.
8829274	8832997	That's a regular game, may not be something that I'm necessarily looking for.
8834479	8849172	But a game that promotes the whoring out of children to buy, you know, crappy toys, which, by the way, they keep putting out more toys because, you know, they're going to just add patches to the game so that more toys are compatible with it.
8850073	8877996	and uh so yeah it's basically just getting kids to beg their parents to buy them toys and you know what parents are dumb enough to buy them their toys then Activision deserves the money that they're getting from them but I'm smart enough to go no it's a toy that doesn't do anything how about I buy you a cooler toy instead and he'll be like okay you know what my rule is no TV until you're five I'm serious I'm dead serious try having a kid that's not gonna happen laughing
8878877	8882242	I know plenty of parents who have been completely successful with not having their kids.
8882262	8884345	You're going to run out of things to do with them.
8885727	8886408	That's okay.
8886689	8890895	I would rather them not be psychologically dependent on TV.
8891357	8893698	They're not dependent on it, but sometimes TV helps.
8893818	8896859	And I don't want to be... I don't care.
8896979	8897759	That doesn't matter to me.
8897819	8898459	None of that matters to me.
8898479	8899480	Let me get back to the caller.
8901520	8908543	So, Ranma, you're giving in to the Skylanders stuff for the sake of this kid who just wants it.
8908563	8911164	So, Ranma, did you buy one of the Tony Hawk ride boards?
8911224	8918326	Because it was a cool little peripheral that they had for Tony Hawk, and you like supporting Activision, so did you buy one of those?
8918346	8918406	Yes.
8919036	8919596	and DarkSakura.
8948850	8953851	If he starts talking with that type of attitude, I will take my belt off right there in Toys R Us.
8954151	8955892	Oh, and I will go to town on him.
8956132	8957332	You best believe that.
8957772	8963993	He can have the game when it gets into the bargain bin like March because that's pretty much when it's going to die out.
8965914	8966254	All right.
8967014	8971395	All right, Ranma, I got to let you go to get more calls, but thank you for the lively discussion.
8972495	8978658	and one thing, Loki, I want you to know I've taken notes on some of this so I know what to look forward to when my time comes.
8978818	8980698	Oh no, he's taking notes!
8981299	8983139	I'm shaking!
8983579	8987021	No, I mean it in a good way, dude.
8987181	8989642	I think he means for when he has his bebe.
8990302	8990982	Yes.
8991863	8992983	Alright, have a good one, Ranma.
8993403	8993744	You too.
8994484	8994724	Later.
8996095	8997877	See, Loki took that to mean, like, taking notes.
8997897	8999379	Like, I'm writing down everything you say.
9015857	9017118	Thank you for watching!
9038451	9039991	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9058596	9059556	Here's the rest of a comment.
9059656	9062778	A patch is just around the corner and we will continue to ban cheaters.
9063178	9064258	We take it seriously.
9064358	9066079	That is our attitude here at Battlefield.
9066459	9071200	We have zero tolerance for cheating players and are banning more all of the time.
9071240	9072021	Let's go to the phones.
9072061	9073081	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9073101	9073441	Who's this?
9075222	9078143	Hello, this is Amiga777.
9078243	9079884	Hello, Amiga777.
9079904	9080604	What's on your mind, buddy?
9082544	9086726	Well, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about
9087642	9104714	The PSN hacks, the X5 Live hacks, and all that type of stuff So I guess one other thing to add to that is I guess much recently some Facebook hackings Well, about today
9115142	9119327	I found out about some thing that was going on.
9119347	9123873	I got a link from someone in chat.
9125315	9133085	And I guess it was something about a gross video that nobody...
9134722	9136844	has ever really gone past it for 15 seconds.
9155584	9157264	Watch this video, it's really gross.
9157304	9159145	It'll usually be something like in the UK.
9159225	9160845	I had one of those one time that clicked.
9160885	9172888	It was like, here's a video of something, blah, blah, blah, and you click on it, and then I realized immediately what it was, and I saw that it posted something to my board, so I blocked it, and then I deleted the post, and that was it.
9173728	9175548	Not everybody's so fast on the figure.
9175568	9181609	Yeah, because if you post it to yours, and then a friend will see that, and they'll post it, and then so on and so forth.
9181909	9183170	So what happened, Amiga?
9183250	9184410	Did you accidentally fall for this?
9186816	9188676	Here's my question.
9189157	9191617	What were they advertising in the video that made you want to click it?
9191657	9194538	Was it like, see big boobies now, click on this link?
9210475	9215297	I've said it was this really, like, nasty video that they were saying.
9215857	9226001	It had, like, this image of the back of this person's neck with this really large, you know, nasty zit on the back or something like that.
9226101	9228402	Gross!
9228462	9229662	Yeah.
9229702	9231063	You're into, like, gross stuff.
9231083	9233524	Mine was a celebrity sex tape, so of course you clicked on that.
9233544	9236865	I was just real curious about it, you know, just tried to check it out.
9237745	9238966	And then, you know...
9240412	9245456	and then it asked me to do this little survey thing and I was like, I don't want to do a survey.
9247117	9248578	I didn't sign up.
9249059	9251320	I want to see the gross things on people's necks.
9251421	9252782	I don't want to see a survey.
9253682	9254443	I want the boobies.
9254623	9255884	I have Shermie.
9256465	9258887	I already see gross shit, literally.
9259427	9266293	So, moral of the story, watch what you click on on Facebook because some of that stuff is like apps and who knows what.
9267574	9267874	Yeah.
9268667	9280532	Right, and then the kicker after that was like a few seconds later, a few of my friends from TED is like, why are you linking me with this, you know, attachment?
9280732	9297900	I just found out that, you know, this thing after I just did whatever it told me, it ended up spreading the attachment message across all my other friends, and so I hated that.
9298979	9301260	And so I guess I ended up just saying, you know what?
9301900	9302300	Forget it.
9302440	9311104	I'm just going to close up my Facebook account and whatnot and change my password and that type of stuff.
9311564	9312665	That's probably for the best.
9312725	9318727	If you get hacked like that, you definitely want to close it up and delete all the crap and change your password as soon as you can.
9319127	9321388	So some good tips for the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.
9322008	9323329	Be careful what you click on.
9325604	9327425	Alright, stick to the porn sites you know.
9327986	9330527	Alright, Amiga77, we're going to let you go buddy so we can get another call.
9330587	9331147	Take care, okay?
9331707	9332968	Alright, bye bye.
9334049	9334929	Be careful what you click on.
9334989	9338891	And see, Microsoft would have you believe that that's how your Xbox is getting hacked, but we'll see.
9339251	9340552	Alright, we got another call on the line.
9340632	9341872	Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio, who's this?
9342533	9342793	Hello?
9343273	9345054	Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio, who's this?
9346995	9348716	Hey, wait a minute, I got a lag going on here.
9348976	9349276	One second.
9349316	9350977	Okay, we'll wait, it's cool.
9352319	9353020	Yeah, sorry about that.
9353100	9356342	I had the show running while I was waiting for you to pick up.
9356542	9356922	Who's this?
9357903	9358803	This is Kaijudo.
9358863	9359944	Hey, Kaijudo, what's on your mind?
9360664	9360964	Not much.
9361004	9362225	I'm just calling to cover a few things.
9362245	9364287	First off, I want to say thanks for my prize.
9364587	9365247	I finally got it.
9365667	9368589	I know we were kind of late in sending it, but yeah, we got it.
9368609	9369270	Don't even worry about that.
9369350	9370290	I was just calling to say thanks.
9370310	9375293	I mean, I wasn't going to rub it in or say, you know, you took forever or anything like that.
9375694	9381057	It took until we finally got another eBay shipment out where we just sent it along with the eBay stuff, so yeah.
9381317	9382738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9405627	9406368	What?
9407549	9410952	Do you remember when I got that fake, it was Assassin's Creed?
9411012	9412033	No, I didn't hear what he said.
9412333	9414375	Oh, one of you signed it, your mom.
9414455	9414735	Yeah.
9414815	9415956	And my mom opened the package.
9416497	9416577	Oh.
9419484	9421226	There you go.
9422187	9426471	Another thing I want to get to is you mentioned earlier I'm not an Xbox fanboy.
9426852	9427552	I'm just a gamer.
9427713	9428594	I love all the systems.
9429254	9434099	You mentioned before that you couldn't remove your credit card from Xbox Live.
9435240	9435941	You can actually do it.
9435961	9436922	You just have to call in
9439411	9442474	I just hate that I have to do that.
9443014	9448819	I hate that they're allowed to make it so easy to give it to them and then it's not as easy to take it away.
9448959	9457425	I get the business side of it and everything, but just after everything I've been through with that company, it's like I'm almost insulted.
9458286	9462067	That they would make me go through that after getting hacked and all that stuff.
9462147	9466788	But yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing is I'll call them and get it taken off that way.
9467088	9470689	I guess my point is at the end of the day, it just sucks that I have to do that.
9470989	9474709	Why can't I take it off the account as easy as I was able to put it on the account?
9475870	9479470	The other weird thing about it is if you do want to remove it midway through your...
9482555	9486879	through your billing cycle, they tell you that you'll lose your Xbox Live.
9486899	9493404	You can have the card removed, but you'll lose whatever that amount of weeks or amount of days that you have left on gold.
9493644	9496146	In my opinion, that's kind of bullshit too.
9496186	9497768	That's a real problem I have with it.
9497808	9500610	So you're not really getting the card off your account.
9500650	9502211	You're telling them that you want to cancel.
9503092	9506655	They're going to cancel you because you don't want to keep a credit card on file with them?
9506975	9508837	And you already paid for it at the beginning of the year.
9508857	9509237	There's proof.
9509477	9515520	When there's proof that that credit card information is being exploited, and they just don't want to admit it, that pisses me off.
9516040	9516440	It's crazy.
9516480	9517280	That's what I'm going through now.
9517320	9523423	I spoke with someone, and you also have to call them to have the automatic renewal removed.
9524003	9524724	But not anymore.
9524744	9532407	I called to say that I wanted the renewal removed, and when my subscription is up, I want the card removed, and then I'll just pay through.
9533327	9549921	whatever that is now supposedly the automatic renewal is all you're able to do that on the website because that was part of the big upgrades they did this week that Jamie was talking about earlier is that you know you can turn that automatic renewal off and I did see that switch so that has changed recently as in like the past week week and a half
9550541	9555845	But as far as the credit cards go, I went in there and I saw a place where you could click remove to remove the credit card.
9556145	9564692	But when I tried to do that, it said, oh, you can't do that because you're using that card to pay for your one month of Xbox Live that you used a card for.
9565032	9567154	Not a credit card, but like an over-the-counter card.
9567174	9567814	I was like, what?
9568435	9568635	So...
9570796	9574659	and two other quick things and then I'll let you get to some more calls.
9574819	9578961	The Saints Row, when I mentioned was it the day improved from Saints Row 2?
9579801	9590548	The thing I was talking about with the camera was I remember in Saints Row 2 they didn't have, you know like GTA 4, you have like three different I think camera angles you can do.
9590928	9594470	You can be like up close, you could be like midway and then like really far back.
9594950	9596331	Saints Row 2 didn't have any of that.
9596391	9599053	It was like your character was always in the way of your...
9599853	9602095	Your little rectical thing.
9602595	9604537	You know what I'm talking about?
9604557	9605538	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
9605578	9605998	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9606038	9607299	So did they improve on that?
9607539	9609361	Because that's what really killed it for me.
9609621	9612423	Because I couldn't see what I was shooting at, and especially in multiplayer.
9612703	9619749	I know they don't have multiplayer anymore, but it was really hard to play multiplayer when your character is so blown up in front of you like that.
9619889	9619969	Oh.
9620969	9623390	I never really had that problem, but I mean, I don't know.
9624631	9627772	Yeah, I don't think they have any sort of way.
9628172	9633434	You can adjust, I think your camera, you might be able to adjust your camera distance.
9634014	9635874	Let me try to look here real quick.
9638035	9639156	Vehicle camera stamp.
9640196	9641196	Instant, yeah.
9641576	9644057	I don't know if they have a way to adjust the camera.
9644878	9645378	Well, here we go.
9645518	9645718	Here's...
9647431	9649193	Uh, no, I don't see a way to adjust the camera.
9650394	9664948	Oh, no, there is, I guess, you know, you can manually adjust it, but, um, yeah, I will find it, you know, it's really a problem being in the way, because you do have the aiming reticle on the screen, so, uh, you can see where you're shooting at.
9667267	9668927	Do you remember playing Saints Row 2?
9669087	9670548	How long ago was it?
9670748	9671828	I haven't played it.
9672449	9673189	I got that game.
9673209	9673889	I'm not even kidding.
9674469	9682692	I got Saints Row 2 the first day it came out, and I maybe played it for two weeks, and I haven't played it since the original year that it came out.
9684153	9687374	The driving and that close-up camera just really...
9688010	9688931	Screwed the game up for me.
9689171	9691673	I never really had trouble with the camera at all.
9691693	9693494	I don't remember the driving being too bad.
9693554	9699919	I mean, I played that game to almost 100%, and I played Saints Row 1 all the way to 100%.
9699979	9706964	And that's including the three DLCs for the second game as well.
9707584	9710066	But, yeah, I don't remember it being a problem.
9710306	9710707	I don't know.
9710747	9714269	This one doesn't seem to be a problem so far, and I'm about 40% through.
9715593	9718254	Yeah, I'm still going to get three, just with everything it has in it.
9718315	9720155	But I'm just curious about that.
9720536	9724157	Plus, I can take screenshots in the game, which is pretty awesome.
9724177	9726319	You can upload them to the SaintsRow.com site.
9726739	9730841	I really wish I did that when I saw Professor Genki shooting rockets at pedestrians.
9730941	9732522	I was like, whoa, what's that?
9733502	9734283	That's different.
9735383	9737326	I'm not going to miss multiplayer in this one.
9737346	9747440	This is the one game that they removed multiplayer where I'm like, I have no problem with that because that multiplayer, I hate to admit it, it was terrible for me.
9747520	9748282	It could have been better.
9748322	9749243	They could have fixed it.
9750222	9750882	Alright, that's it.
9750962	9752443	I've been playing Skyrim.
9752883	9753444	It's a great game.
9753664	9754244	We all know that.
9754964	9756565	Anyone who hasn't picked it up, pick it up.
9756885	9758786	I'm freaking loving it.
9758806	9759747	You guys have a nice night.
9760087	9762068	Hey, no problem.
9762288	9763629	Enjoy your bootleg copy.
9763749	9764449	Alright, take care.
9765289	9765489	Bye.
9766730	9768331	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9768371	9769132	Good calls tonight.
9769152	9769772	Thanks, you guys.
9769832	9775076	To those that didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but did you catch the part where we said we had no emails this week?
9775416	9775516	One.
9775596	9777277	We had one that came in right before the show.
9777698	9779879	So you should write down your thoughts, and we'll read them next week.
9779919	9784462	Mailbag at orangeentree.com, or you can tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.
9785203	9788245	All right, in the meantime, I need to finish up just a couple tweets here that we had.
9788725	9793769	DarkTetsuya tweeted us and said, so the DDR freak thing is still sort of happening in Milpitas.
9793969	9794550	Road trip?
9795350	9796132	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
9796152	9798197	I got a Facebook invite for that today.
9800403	9800743	Maybe?
9802847	9827380	I don't know it's kind of one of those we have a show I don't know we'll see um I'd like to go but it just might be too last minute for me I got something else going on next weekend too uh Actdeft last tweet tonight sequence that rhythm rpg game for cheap if enough users subscribe to the page game getter uh getter.gforums.net I guess uh
9828965	9829847	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9842410	9842990	What page is that?
9843611	9848773	It's getter.g-forums.net Look at the tweets to OLR.
9849153	9855275	Because right now the game usually costs $5 and right now it's down to $3 because 101 people have subscribed.
9855835	9857196	But what are you subscribing to?
9858316	9859217	You've got to be careful.
9860457	9861878	Hopefully you're not subscribing to spam.
9862898	9864418	Alright, that does it for tweets tonight.
9864679	9867220	Let me go around quickly and see if there's any last minute stories.
9867260	9869701	I think we've covered everything but I'll check with Loki real quick.
9869741	9870901	Loki, any last minute stories tonight?
9871149	9871629	Orange Lounge
9897951	9912686	and then of course the season pass the first season pass has been announced and this includes the DLC or at least the first three DLCs that are going to be coming out and if you ordered this game off of THQ their store you actually got it for free
9914567	9938084	and in season pass we'll save you 15% off of buying the DLC separately and so what it includes is Genki Bowl 7 which is supposed to be coming out in January and the description is the wild world of Genki takes over Steelport in a sporting tradition totally and utterly unlike anything else and this is why I was laughing before
9938704	9943187	Gangstas in Space is the second DLC coming Winter 2012.
9943247	9948291	The Saints Go Intergalactic in the Science Fiction Misadventure.
9948671	9951353	And then the last one is Trouble with Clones.
9952333	9953574	And that's coming Spring 2012.
9954115	9957297	And it says a copycat killing at its finest.
9958177	9965082	And also it includes the Nightblade DLC, which includes... And Nightblade is one of the fictional, like,
9967060	9972125	Nightblade Mobile, Alter Boy Outfit, Bloody Kenanus Outfit, and Bloody Kenanus Bike Which I believe is $20
9988678	9997524	And then, of course, we talked a little bit about some cool streaming of game demos on YouTube.
9998785	10002247	And, of course, now there's one for Dead Rising 2.
10002327	10006390	They can stream through your web browser using Gaikai.
10007330	10013835	And I don't believe it's on YouTube, but let's see here.
10015296	10036990	Capcom Unity had a link to it and I believe it's actually it's on through Gaikai.com so if you go there you can check it out it's a 30 minute demo that's pretty awesome wow that's that's that same site that had the FIFA demo that we talked about a couple weeks ago yeah nice very cool
10038137	10038417	All right.
10039659	10039939	Excuse me.
10039979	10042002	Is that it for the stories?
10042222	10042502	All right.
10042562	10045326	I'm looking at these leaked costumes.
10045586	10046847	Yeah, I saw that from HitStun.
10046887	10051333	It had posted a link in chat for the Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3 download costumes.
10052068	10053989	Yeah, there's like a Weapon X Wolverine.
10054469	10054729	Nice.
10055070	10055790	That's pretty cool.
10056010	10059652	And one of Beautiful Joe out of costume.
10059852	10065195	I'm so glad now in retrospect that we didn't buy Marvel vs. Capcom 3 now that there's the ultimate one that's coming out.
10065215	10066916	Well, I bought it, but you know, I'm cool.
10067056	10072499	Oh, there's one of What's Her Face, the other chick from Devil May Cry with the white hair.
10072921	10073201	Nice.
10073902	10074342	Very cool.
10075083	10075343	All right.
10075363	10077585	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.
10077665	10078205	Oh, God.
10078385	10079826	The worst ever character.
10080487	10080567	What?
10082509	10088994	There's one of Iron Patriot, who was the character that I hated during the whole Civil War thing.
10090395	10091616	But this is actually pretty cool.
