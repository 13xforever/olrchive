0	19440	Today, November 13th, 2011, DC Universe explodes after going free to play.
19440	24880	The way to import UMDs to the PS Vita is revealed, and could the Wii U support multiple tablet
24880	31880	controllers after all?
31880	35080	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35080	38800	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38800	46920	We are live tonight, November the 13th of 2011, with the 435th episode of our show.
46920	52560	We are live, of course, at All Games Radio, as we are every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.
52560	56960	We tape live Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
56960	58040	show.
58040	61360	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.
61360	65320	Say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
65320	66320	Hi.
66320	67320	How are you, Jamie?
67320	68320	Happy.
68320	69320	Happy.
69320	70880	If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.
70880	71880	Bleh.
71880	72880	All right.
72880	75720	Joining us in just a few moments is Techmaster Loki.
75720	80120	He's a little late to studio tonight, I'm literally listening to him walk in right this
80120	81120	second.
81120	82120	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
82120	85720	I'd like to hear a little more about that excuse as to why he's getting situated right
85720	86720	now.
86720	87720	We'll come back to him in a minute.
87720	88720	Saints Row.
88720	89720	That's why.
89720	90720	Really?
90720	91720	Really?
91720	92720	You stood the show up for Saints Row.
92720	93720	Are you surprised?
93720	94720	Actually, no.
94720	95720	Not at all.
95720	97920	Well, welcome, Techmaster Loki.
97920	99720	Let me introduce chat while you get situated real quick.
99720	103040	We are, of course, the show where every gamer has a voice, and we always invite your voices
103040	104280	via email.
104280	106280	And seriously, we need more voices via email.
106280	107280	Is it true?
107280	108280	No emails tonight?
108280	112040	I think everybody's too busy playing Skyrim and Modern Warfare and all that stuff.
112040	117040	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, the Twitter, of course, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and our
117040	119560	chat room, our live chat room, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
119560	122080	Oh, yeah, I forgot to load chat.
122080	123080	Sorry, guys.
123080	124800	You might want to log into chat.
124800	129720	Actually, just before we got started with the show tonight, Amiga777 was wondering why
129720	131000	is attendance this low?
131000	134960	I guess our chat room is a little bit emptier than it usually is right now.
134960	139560	And I would say it's probably all the crazy games that are out, and it's a busy time of
139560	140560	year.
140560	144120	Technically, it's not the holidays yet, but let me give you this.
144120	148400	I went to the mall yesterday, and it was a madhouse, absolute madhouse.
148400	152560	I would have thought yesterday was the weekend after Thanksgiving.
152560	153840	It was that crowded.
153840	158960	So maybe that's a good sign that the economy is coming back, or maybe people just want
158960	162360	to get out and get their shopping done before all the craziness hits.
162360	163360	I don't know.
163360	167040	This is why I don't go to the mall at all this time of year.
167040	170960	I can't say I blame you, but that's where my haircut place is, so I had to go over there,
170960	172720	and there were other errands I wanted to do.
172720	176040	So what can you do?
176040	179440	Let's also introduce the chat room.
179440	182280	We're going to get to the Skype calls a little later on.
182280	183280	Let me talk about this.
183280	185760	Speaking of deals, I wanted to start off with a discussion on this real quick, and that
185760	188800	is the Black Friday stuff that's starting to hit the internet.
188800	192360	And if you don't know what Black Friday is, I don't know what hole you've been living
192360	193680	in, but maybe you don't live in the US.
193680	194680	That could be it, too.
194680	199480	Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving here in the US, and it's usually a day that's
199480	204760	kind of the unofficial official kickoff to the holiday shopping season, and things get
204760	207200	discounted like crazy.
207200	211800	And some of the Black Friday ads are starting to leak out there on the internet, and you
211800	216720	kind of have to take a lot of what you read on the internet with a grain of salt.
216720	221880	But a website that's very respected and reputable within the gaming community, CheapAssGamer
221880	226000	at CheapAssGamer.com, is compiling some of the better deals that are going on right now.
226000	228360	Now, I'm not going to plagiarize and read the entire list.
228360	231480	If you want to read that, you can go to their website, but I'll give you kind of some of
231480	233360	the highlights that I'm seeing here.
233360	239000	A lot of the consoles appear to be deeply discounted, including it looks like Target
239000	245480	is selling an Xbox 360 console for $139, the 4 gig console.
245480	249520	That's very inexpensive considering that guy is what, usually about $199?
249520	251360	That's a very deep discount.
251360	257160	PlayStation 3 seems to be $199 most places, probably the cheapest place is Walmart by
257160	261480	a whole 2 cents, but Best Buy and Radio Shack are deeply discounting that as well.
261480	268680	The Wii is down to $100, 3DS going down to $179.99, that's a bundle pack going on there.
268680	271360	I was going to say, because that's not a discount at all.
271360	274080	Right, but it's a bundle pack with a game.
274080	276280	And let's see, discounts on games.
276280	277280	Current games.
277280	285520	Batman Arkham City, going to be $28 at Walmart, $29 at Best Buy, Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, it's
285520	289320	still $60 but you can get a $10 gift card at Target.
289320	295840	Gears of War 3 for $28 at Walmart, Need for Speed The Run, $30 at Best Buy.
295840	299040	Some pretty good deals throughout there.
299040	302720	And again, that list I was reading from is just CheapAssGamer.com, they have a little
302720	304920	compilation going on there.
304920	308680	That's their specialty, is looking at game deals.
308680	312440	But I wanted to kind of ask the folks at the studio here, do you get excited about Black
312440	313440	Friday?
313440	315440	Is that something you think you might participate in for some of these deals?
315440	318280	Or are you like, hell no, get me the hell away from those stores.
318280	319280	No.
319280	320280	No?
320280	322560	I don't have anything I don't already want.
322560	324360	So if you want something, you just go get it.
324360	326280	Having gone out to stores on Black Friday before?
326280	328080	No, I'll be staying inside.
328080	334360	I mean, really, I can get just as good deals online.
334360	337600	And I know people who are going.
337600	341400	So if they're going to be there anyway, I just say, okay, you do this for me.
341400	342800	Besides, it's all about Cyber Monday.
342800	344360	Cyber Monday, I don't have to go anywhere.
344360	346580	I just sit down and deals come to me.
346580	347580	That's true.
347580	349000	I'm a little more into the Cyber Monday.
349000	352760	I have never gone out on Black Friday, but some of these deals, I don't know, they have
352760	354880	me thinking there's some good game prices.
354880	355880	You know who doesn't last?
355880	356880	Steam.
356880	357880	I'm looking forward to Steam.
357880	361000	Yeah, I was going to say, Cyber Monday, that's a big Steam thing right there.
361000	362000	Oh yeah.
362000	364720	That day is going to hurt on Steam, that's for sure.
364720	365720	Anyway.
365720	372440	But I mean, really, the only things that I could possibly want slash need is I'd like
372440	373820	a new laptop.
373820	375080	That's about it.
375080	379100	I would like for my current computer to not be a piece of shit, which it won't be once
379100	384560	I put Windows 7 and Linux Mint on it because that's coming soon.
384560	385560	I was surprised.
385560	388480	You told me the other day you were still running Vista and I was like, oh, poor thing.
388480	390560	Because I've had problems going on.
390560	394880	But I mean, right now, honestly, given my situation, I'm just lucky to have a roof over
394880	396080	my head.
396080	398440	I'm happy to have food to eat.
398440	401360	I'm happy to have stuff to wear.
401360	402360	So quite honestly...
402360	403840	You're being very zen about the whole thing.
403840	407480	You're just very like, you know, I don't need material possessions.
407480	411080	Well, it's not really so much of a that.
411080	415440	It's just that having been slapped in my, you know, in the face with the possibility
415440	419080	of maybe being homeless or having nothing to eat.
419080	420080	You're not going to be homeless.
420080	426520	But it's sort, it's sort of realigned my, um, my values, I guess.
426520	427520	My perspective.
427520	428520	Yeah, I gotcha.
428520	431880	I used to really dread turning 30, but then when I was really sick in 2008, which you
431880	436280	guys might remember, like I was like, hey, turning 30 is awesome because I actually live
436280	437280	to be 30.
437280	440000	Life is actually better once you're 30 too.
440000	441000	It really is.
441000	444560	But anyway, that's, that's, that's for another, that's for the zen show, which will be our
444560	445560	third podcast.
445560	450040	But I mean, seriously, it was just sort of like, you know, if, if I want to, if I want
450040	453560	these games, I can rent them if I really want to play it.
453560	457800	You know, I've got tons of games that I've, you know, hardly played.
457800	464080	I've just, um, uh, started project diva, which is fun.
464080	466840	Well, we'll get into that in a minute during gaming weeks, but let me go to some of the
466840	469840	comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandrady.com.
469840	473760	Hitstun says, I get roughly half my Christmas shopping done on black Friday.
473760	477480	Salacious Pop says, fuck the mall, seriously, maybe fries.
477480	479760	It's the only in real life store I'd go to.
479760	480760	That's, that's the worst.
480760	485480	Do you not go to fries and black Friday if you want to go to fries and watch the guy
485480	490720	walking around with like a balloon that says line ends here and then you watch it snake
490720	491720	through the entire store.
491720	495640	Yeah, I did that one time cause I, I think it was actually living with you at the time.
495640	499520	Yeah, I think I was buying like a replacement motherboard or something cause my computer
499520	504760	had died and, and I went there and that line took like an hour and a half to go through
504760	505760	black again.
505760	509680	Actually, I have gone out at black Friday, but I went out like right before the store's
509680	513040	closed when it's more normal, like everybody's gone.
513040	516320	Granted, you won't get some of the deep, deep deals at that time cause a lot of stuff is
516320	518640	sold out, but there's still a lot of good stuff on the shelves.
518640	522400	It's not like everything is suddenly missing from the shelves when you go there.
522400	523400	So I don't know.
523400	524840	I've seen some good deals then.
524840	526440	Um, let's see.
526440	530520	Act Def says, I got my dream cast for $50 on a black Friday sale.
530520	531520	That's pretty awesome.
531520	535080	A game grew says, I got my 360 on a black Friday a few years back.
535080	540560	Uh, Eric K says, I black Friday on Amazon and Amiga seven, seven, seven says, what's
540560	541560	a fries?
541560	542560	And that's right.
542560	543560	They don't have them everywhere.
543560	545120	It's think, uh, like a best buy.
545120	546720	That's like three times as big.
546720	547920	That's kind of what a fries is.
547920	551360	This sells, you know, a lot of electronic and appliances and all that.
551360	553240	That's pretty much what a fries is, right?
553240	554240	So a lot of good deals.
554240	559080	They sell a lot more components than a bad really crappy toys that you don't need.
559080	560520	All right.
560520	562760	And food like nerd food.
562760	563760	That's that's the other weird thing.
563760	565320	Yeah, astronaut ice cream.
565320	566800	Best Buy does kind of have that though.
566800	568880	They have like the movie food at their counter.
568880	569880	So whatever.
569880	570880	Anyway.
570880	571880	All right.
571880	572880	That's comments from our chat.
572880	576240	Not only can you get your, you know, games and stuff like that, you can get stuff to
576240	584400	outfit a convenience store, including a, um, cotton candy maker, a hot dog, um, cooker
584400	586080	and uh, all sorts of things.
586080	587080	Yeah.
587080	588080	Just random stuff.
588080	590680	Not that I've ever bought any of that shit at fries, but I've thought about it.
590680	593840	I'm like, did you get your deep fryer at fries?
593840	594840	No, that was a Christmas gift.
594840	595840	That's right.
595840	596840	That's right.
596840	597840	All right.
597840	598840	Another one, but the wife won't let me.
598840	599840	All right.
599840	602640	Anyhow, uh, we're going to go on and, uh, talk about our gaming weeks and the types
602640	604560	of video games that we have been playing this week.
604560	605800	Um, we'll start off with dark soccer.
605800	607320	I know you mentioned project diva.
607320	612480	Yeah, I will have started it and then remembered that I had to write a research paper.
612480	613840	So I turned it off.
613840	621160	I'm trying to actually find the, um, our, uh, charger for our PSP so that I can, um,
621160	624600	take it with me to school, but it's, it's cute.
624600	625600	Very pretty.
625600	632600	And, um, I played some well, I'm almost level 60 from on gyaru.
632600	633840	That's the one in the Horde house Guild, right?
633840	634840	Yeah.
634840	635840	The one in the courthouse Guild.
635840	636840	Good times.
636840	637840	I'm really enjoying priests.
637840	641120	I never thought I would really like it, which I should plug that on this show, like our
641120	642120	Horde house Guild.
642120	645560	And of course there's a spinoff show that I host, um, the best little Horde house in
645560	648400	Azeroth at Horde house.com, which is the Warcraft show.
648400	652080	Dark soccer has been a guest several times, but usually it's my co-host is a guy named
652080	653560	Exifer who's very vulgar.
653560	657000	Well, it's an explicit show, uh, but it's fun.
657000	662800	And uh, we play on the drendon server Horde side in a Guild called the best little Horde
662800	665640	house and we are in, or no best little Horde house.
665640	666640	It's in the Guild finder.
666640	668080	Very easy to find.
668080	672000	And um, yeah, you can play with dark soccer and I know you could just ask my druid is
672000	676320	there gordita, but you need to come back and we need to do pally pals.
676320	677320	Yeah.
677320	678320	We were having fun with Rob.
678320	680760	Rob and I have paladins that look oddly related.
680760	683280	I have a paladin named diabetes.
683280	688560	Mine's named Sylviara, but I actually tried to make a decent name.
688560	690960	I could have named her cotton candy.
690960	694220	I decided since they weren't going to give me the walrus people so I could have a walrus
694220	695400	named diabetes.
695400	697240	I guess I'll just have a paladin.
697240	704840	I made you a Tuscar in the, um, the, the, uh, model viewer named Wilford.
704840	706640	I made it an honor of you.
706640	707640	Nice.
707640	711320	I'm laughing at the salacious pop in our chat room that says Rob is going to come home with
711320	712800	a churro machine now.
712800	714120	Do they sell those at fries?
714120	716000	Cause if so, that's on my holiday list.
716000	720080	You know, I don't know, but I'm serious to go over there.
720080	721280	It's the imply.
721280	724820	It's part of the appliance section, at least in our local one over here in Roseville goddamn
724820	725820	churro machine.
725820	727160	Do you know how popular I'd be?
727160	729840	It's like, I'd be like having Disneyland in my house.
729840	735960	I live in the cat bathroom so I could always have, if they have a slurpee machine there,
735960	737600	I will have a slurpee machine anyway.
737600	738600	I know what I'm getting.
738600	739600	You Rob.
739600	740600	Sorry.
740600	742480	It's more of a gift for, for salacious pop.
742480	743480	Oh wait.
743480	744760	Why would you get me a gift for him?
744760	745880	Because you'll benefit from it.
745880	746880	Okay.
746880	747880	Oh, I see.
747880	750120	It's something where it's like, it'll keep him busy so I can do what I want.
750120	751120	No.
751120	752120	Okay.
752120	753120	All right.
753120	755120	Anyhow, back to games you've been playing.
755120	756120	Wow.
756120	759760	Um, I really haven't had a whole lot of time for games.
759760	764480	As I said last week, we were, we, uh, had to finish compiling the magazine this week.
764480	766960	So most of my time has been spent at school.
766960	773760	Um, so I did like a little bit of flash gaming and rearranged my entire portable hard drive,
773760	778880	uh, because, uh, I was hanging out with the art director while he was finishing the compiling
778880	781160	and I had to do last minute corrections and stuff.
781160	783200	Um, that's all done.
783200	784200	Hopefully we go to print.
784200	787040	Um, I think tomorrow or Tuesday.
787040	790080	So now that that's done, now my research papers written, I won't have to hear you talk about
790080	791080	it anymore.
791080	792080	Yay.
792080	794120	I'm expecting everyone to buy an issue.
794120	795120	Seriously.
795120	796120	I will.
796120	799540	You'll have my eternal gratitude if you buy an issue of the American river review and
799540	800840	can see all my gorgeous work.
800840	801840	That's okay.
801840	802840	I have enough issues already.
802840	803840	You've got subscriptions.
803840	806320	What are you talking about?
806320	807920	But I'm running low on toilet paper.
807920	809320	Dan finished Arkham city.
809320	810320	Oh yeah.
810320	812040	And he finished all the missions.
812040	813040	Nice.
813040	815040	Has he found every, every Riddler trophy?
815040	816120	I doubt it.
816120	818360	He has found enough to find Riddler.
818360	819360	Nice.
819360	822600	So he beat Riddler, which is kind of a let down.
822600	823600	Really?
823600	824600	I mean, it's funny.
824600	828440	I have to say Riddler sets off my Gator.
828440	832840	Riddler is kind of like, it's going to sound really weird, but Riddler's kind of hot.
832840	835280	Like it depends on which Riddler we're talking about.
835280	840120	This Riddler is like, not so much like Frank Gorshin Riddler from sixties Batman, but I'm
840120	845040	talking like when they tried to make Riddler very Metro sexual, I was going to say Metro,
845040	847920	but he sets off, but he actually does set off my Gator.
847920	848920	All right.
848920	854180	This is the first time I've ever had a character in a game set off my infallible Gator.
854180	856600	It's the greatest question of all.
856600	858360	Yeah.
858360	860680	And then Dan did the whole thing with Catwoman.
860680	864680	You know, when you go back to help Batman instead, he did the thing where she leaves
864680	865800	him.
865800	868280	I don't know that part yet, so you better not be spoiling her.
868280	869280	I'll come over there and kick your butt.
869280	870280	It's just funny.
870280	872320	You should do it at least once cause you can, you can go back and fix it.
872320	875760	But I hear story mode is actually not that long.
875760	876760	All things considered.
876760	881440	No, the, the, the primary missions are really not that long, but there's so much else to
881440	882440	do.
882440	888040	Like the hush ones are really cool because I'm not a big Batman reader.
888040	892600	You know, I don't like DC comics, but I read my, one of my favorite Batman things I've
892600	895200	ever read was heart of hush.
895200	901200	And that was a really good actual Batman Catwoman story.
901200	904120	And I kind of like the dynamic that the two have in the game.
904120	905600	Do you know why I love Batman?
905600	909760	And it's, it's not, I'm actually not a big comic reader, although I don't know, like
909760	914140	I'm sitting here reading comic, funny enough salacious pop, but we, we went to a brand
914140	917480	new comic book store out in a Thomas, like some brand new place that just opened up like
917480	920560	a month ago and he bought the killing joke.
920560	922560	The killing joke is very good.
922560	926720	And so I was thinking I might steal that and read it because I don't use, I'm not like
926720	927720	a comic reader.
927720	928720	It's not that I dislike them.
928720	929720	I just, I don't know.
929720	930720	It's a fucked up story.
930720	931720	Yeah, I know.
931720	932720	I know.
932720	935560	But like the reason why I love Batman so much is not just the movies, which were brilliant,
935560	940840	but seriously growing up, I think I saw every single episode of the old Batman series from
940840	942040	the sixties with Adam West.
942040	946200	No, I did not grow up in the sixties, but they reran them all the time.
946200	947600	But Julie Newmar was my hero.
947600	948600	Oh, she's great.
948600	951960	And it's really sad that they don't rerun them now.
951960	955480	I think they do, but it's on a very obscure network.
955480	956480	It's not like it's on FX anymore.
956480	957800	You can still find it somewhere.
957800	958800	That's right there.
958800	961720	Perfect adult swim material, I'm telling you.
961720	968520	But it's just, I like all the nods to, and even someone like me who isn't totally into
968520	973200	Batman, like there's a few characters in there that I know they're Batman characters, but
973200	974200	I don't know who they are.
974200	979500	Like I knew Solomon Grundy was a Batman character, but I had no idea who exactly he was.
979500	981920	For me, I love the art and the game.
981920	987040	So I've just been sitting there watching him because I'm looking at the scenery.
987040	990600	And for me, like my favorite places when they go, I don't know if you've been there yet,
990600	994720	but the Wonder City underground, the sunken streets.
994720	997460	I've been in a subway system underground.
997460	1002880	Under the subway, closer to where Wonder Tower is, you can go underground and it's like this
1002880	1008440	World's Fair exhibition, but it's all these city streets, like little, you know, with
1008440	1010640	buggies and everything, only it's all torn up.
1010640	1013360	But a lot of the artwork in there is very Art Nouveau.
1013360	1016800	I'm up to the, just to give you an idea where I'm at in the story, keep in mind, I have
1016800	1020560	done some of the side quests, like some of the Zazz stuff, which that guy's scary.
1020560	1024160	But okay, was it just me or does the voice sound like a woman at first?
1024160	1026160	He just sounds like he has a problem.
1026160	1028040	But he sounded like a woman.
1028040	1029040	You want to give him a hug, but you don't.
1029040	1031800	I'll carve your name into my skin.
1031800	1034600	You put the notion in the basket.
1034600	1038240	The chat room is reminding us that they do rerun them on the hub.
1038240	1039680	Okay, the hub.
1039680	1040680	Is that really, okay.
1040680	1041680	There you go.
1041680	1042680	All right.
1042680	1046320	But anyway, I was going to say, I am at the point in the game, I'm in the museum and-
1046320	1047640	So you're hunting penguin.
1047640	1048640	Sort of.
1048640	1053240	We just kicked some of his henchman's ass and then we were at this part with boats and
1053240	1054720	you're having to use the grappling hook to-
1054720	1055720	That's annoying.
1055720	1056720	Oh my God.
1056720	1057720	I was so frustrated.
1057720	1059880	Do you know how many times I've been eaten by a shark?
1059880	1063200	And you know how many more times you're going to have to do shit like that in the game?
1063200	1064200	Ugh.
1064200	1065440	Wait, wait, so you get-
1065440	1066440	Otherwise I love it.
1066440	1068240	Wait, so you get the cryo bomb.
1068240	1069240	All right.
1069240	1070240	Cause you-
1070240	1071240	Can't wait.
1071240	1072240	All right.
1072240	1073240	You throw it in the water.
1073240	1075240	Or else it gets the hose again.
1075240	1076240	You know what though?
1076240	1078080	You know what we want to know what's really annoying is going and trying to do all that
1078080	1080080	shit with Catwoman.
1080080	1081840	But keep in mind, she can climb on the ceiling.
1081840	1084000	Dude, the Catwoman parts are my favorite so far.
1084000	1085000	Like that part-
1085000	1086000	I love her whip.
1086000	1088240	Her and Poison Ivy, she's so much fun to battle with.
1088240	1089240	Anyway, sorry.
1089240	1091480	That's, that's, that's hotness.
1091480	1092480	Her and Poison Ivy.
1092480	1093480	She is, she is pretty hot.
1093480	1096840	In fact, I think in the chat room, Tiger Claw asked hotter than Catwoman, I think in reference
1096840	1097840	to my Riddler reference.
1097840	1101960	Oh, I mean, it kind of depends on what you're into, but you know, I'm very secure in my
1101960	1105560	homosexuality when I say this, Catwoman has a nice rack.
1105560	1110240	It's, it's the, uh, the new style Catwoman too.
1110240	1113480	So she's probably fucking Batman.
1113480	1119320	Like any minute that, that zipper's just going to fly open and go woohoo.
1119320	1123960	So yeah, so while I haven't been playing it, I've really been getting into it.
1123960	1129240	Um, just like I said, for me, it's going around and looking at everything and really taking
1129240	1133480	in the scenery and Dan will actually just stop and go exploring places for me so I can
1133480	1134480	see it.
1134480	1135480	All right.
1135480	1136480	That's fun.
1136480	1137480	So it's pretty cool.
1137480	1138600	The other night I was playing with a group of friends and they were like, go in the place
1138600	1139760	that says live nude girls.
1139760	1142040	There's a place that says live nude girls, go in the door.
1142040	1143040	There's two signs.
1143040	1144040	Live nude girls.
1144040	1145040	Yeah.
1145040	1146040	I think you can go in there.
1146040	1147040	Yeah.
1147040	1148040	The door was locked.
1148040	1149040	I'm assuming maybe it comes into play later.
1149040	1150760	I really, oh really?
1150760	1153920	I assumed it was a Riddler room that came up later or something.
1153920	1159200	Some of those, some of the speculation Riddler room wouldn't be at live nude girls.
1159200	1160200	Yeah.
1160200	1161200	Yeah.
1161200	1162200	Oh my.
1162200	1164680	His little hideout by the way is fucking sadistic.
1164680	1165680	I love it.
1165680	1169920	So, um, but yeah, tiger class says, you know, you can punch the shark.
1169920	1170920	Really?
1170920	1172880	I'm going to do that next time.
1172880	1175000	I'm going to tell Dan to go punch the shark.
1175000	1176000	I'm going to shoot him in the face.
1176000	1177480	You cannot jump it.
1177480	1180640	Anyhow, so you need to move on.
1180640	1181640	Sorry.
1181640	1184600	So really the, that's been what my gaming week has been.
1184600	1188920	Um, I'm planning on, uh, now that I've got my research paper done, I've got like one
1188920	1192440	more paper that I've got to do with my group, but we're review, we have to pick a piece
1192440	1193440	of art.
1193440	1196440	So we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
1196440	1197440	Good times.
1197440	1201640	Cause we, cause half the group's like into, into modern, you know, movies and stuff.
1201640	1202640	And he said, we could do a movie.
1202640	1204840	So I was like, we're going to do a Rocky shit.
1204840	1207120	So they were coming over Tuesday to do the time warp.
1207120	1208120	Good times.
1208120	1212640	And, um, so when that's all done, I'm going to play the shit out of Project Diva.
1212640	1214680	All right.
1214680	1215680	Hell yeah.
1215680	1219880	All right, Loki, need I ask, how was your gaming week?
1219880	1223000	Um, very fulfilling.
1223000	1225080	Not play a lot of things this week, actually.
1225080	1229600	Uh, of course, Grand Theft Auto, um, which is kind of funny because Grand Theft Auto,
1229600	1236880	I think we're, uh, transitioning onto a new game after seven years or so.
1236880	1240760	Gee, what could that possibly be?
1240760	1242280	Call of Duty, modern warfare.
1242280	1243280	What?
1243280	1245360	I thought for sure you were going to say Saints Row.
1245360	1247560	No, it doesn't have multiplayer in it.
1247560	1249120	No death match in it.
1249120	1250120	Oh, really?
1250120	1251840	It has co-op, but not death match.
1251840	1252840	Yes.
1252840	1253840	Oh, okay.
1253840	1254840	Okay.
1254840	1255840	So wait a minute.
1255840	1256840	Wait a minute.
1256840	1257840	Wait a minute.
1257840	1258840	Okay.
1258840	1259840	So now you're, you're all about Call of Duty, modern warfare, like three, the new one.
1259840	1260840	No one.
1260840	1263600	Well, Call of Duty for modern warfare.
1263600	1264600	Oh, okay.
1264600	1268560	So that one, because it's cheap, you know, you have to buy five copies.
1268560	1269560	I see.
1269560	1273800	So you're starting with the, you know, one you could get for $9.99 these days and exactly
1273800	1274800	so.
1274800	1276260	So that's what we're playing.
1276260	1279760	And the only reason that they're switching to it is because they got tired of me beating
1279760	1281120	them.
1281120	1286260	And I'm happy to report that our first game that we played on it, I nearly, well, I doubled
1286260	1290840	second place's scores, so, uh, I'm still going to beat them in this game.
1290840	1294080	So I don't know what the point was in switching, but whatever.
1294080	1295080	They want to mix it up.
1295080	1296560	I have an important news flash.
1296560	1297560	What?
1297560	1299560	Dan brought me pizza.
1299560	1300560	Did he bring me pizza?
1300560	1301560	You can get some.
1301560	1302560	I'm just kidding.
1302560	1303560	I'll wait.
1303560	1308800	Um, and then other than that, let's see, I played Zelda, the four swords adventure on,
1308800	1314120	um, the 3DS or DS, I guess it's off of the store.
1314120	1319480	Um, it's all right, but I think definitely more of a game for more than one person and
1319480	1321920	not too fun playing it by herself.
1321920	1328400	And um, I don't know, it's all right, but yeah, definitely more fun with more people.
1328400	1329400	And then, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1329400	1331640	I played saints for the third, which is just amazing.
1331640	1338180	Um, I'm actually about 13 hours into it already and it's just great.
1338180	1342400	It's every bit of awesome that I wanted it to be.
1342400	1343400	It is.
1343400	1347240	And then some, there's gotta be something negative, something you're not happy about.
1347240	1353600	Ah, the escort missions are still annoying because the AI is still kind of eh.
1353600	1356960	It's a little bit glitchy now and then, but not anything that really hurts the game.
1356960	1357960	Just like funny stuff.
1357960	1362080	Like I'll finish a tank mission or something and when I'm done there's corpses stuck in
1362080	1366320	the ground and you can walk up to them and they kind of like bounce around back and forth
1366320	1367320	and stuff.
1367320	1369480	It's the same shit that's funny in Skyrim.
1369480	1372280	Like mammoths just randomly falling from the sky and all that.
1372280	1373280	Just random stuff.
1373280	1376640	And that's fine, you know, the games, I expect that game to be slightly buggy because that's
1376640	1378760	how Singing Spyro is.
1378760	1381640	It's just slightly buggy and it's fine.
1381640	1383640	It makes it more funny.
1383640	1386880	I gotta say though, the missions are great.
1386880	1389220	Just what I've played so far.
1389220	1397560	They have some really good kind of direction to them and there's even some that have kind
1397560	1402200	of music that plays along with it that's just really awesome.
1402200	1404120	It just sets the mood so well.
1404120	1407020	How does the game, like, you know, keep in mind I haven't played a lot of the Saints
1407020	1408020	Row games.
1408020	1413160	I played the first one for like an hour, but like, how does it transition from all these
1413160	1417400	bits of randomness one to another because isn't it a very open world game and like when
1417400	1421360	I started seeing all this stuff like that there's Tron's parodies in it and all these
1421360	1425560	things I was like how do they, how do they work that all into the game?
1425560	1428400	How does it go from one parody to another?
1428400	1433220	It works really well actually and like the very beginning, the first few missions, actually
1433220	1434240	quite a bit of the missions.
1434240	1439160	I think I was up through 20% of the game and it was still doing tutorial missions I guess
1439160	1444840	to kind of introduce you to the different activities that you can do in the game.
1444840	1448400	And um, you know, it's really strange sometimes.
1448400	1458320	Like for example, there's one that you're being trained by, by this one Saint that you
1458320	1465520	pick up who's voiced by Hulk Hogan and he's training you to be able to confront Kilbane
1465520	1471280	who's this luchador, the leader of the luchador gang or whatever in there and stuff.
1471280	1478280	And so it's almost like a little bit of Karate Kid sort of and it's great because one of
1478280	1482160	the songs in the game is the best from Karate Kid.
1482160	1486400	You're the best around.
1486400	1487400	Yes exactly.
1487400	1492560	And they actually have that in the part when you first talk to the guy and stuff.
1492560	1498160	So he's having you feel pain so one of the missions that you do, it's basically an activity.
1498160	1501960	So there's lots of pop culture references left and right essentially.
1501960	1507960	It's not all pop culture references, I mean it's just really over the top.
1507960	1509700	Just very big action sequences.
1509700	1512200	How many people have you slapped in the face of the dildo?
1512200	1513200	I don't know.
1513200	1516640	But I think it keeps the stats for that.
1516640	1517640	You lost count.
1517640	1519380	I mean come on.
1519380	1520380	This game has...
1520380	1521760	How many whores have you killed?
1521760	1522760	I don't know.
1522760	1524200	I don't think I've killed that many whores.
1524200	1525360	There aren't that many whores.
1525360	1526720	There's some strange shit, okay?
1526720	1531360	Like seriously, you'll be walking around all of a sudden, you know, there's gimps walking
1531360	1535480	around and then these furries walking around, it's like what the hell is going on?
1535480	1541220	Today, and I think this is an Easter egg, today I ran across, you know, Genki, the cathead
1541220	1546600	guy that's running this Japanese game show or whatever, the mascot for this game almost
1546600	1547600	died.
1547600	1552640	All of a sudden, I see him running around the street shooting people with rocket launchers.
1552640	1554520	What the fuck is he doing out here?
1554520	1560200	And so I went to go try to kill him, and I did manage to kill him finally, but it took
1560200	1561200	a lot.
1561200	1567160	I think it glitched him underneath a dump truck or something that crushed him to death.
1567160	1570880	Kaijuto in our chat room is asking, Loki, did they fix the camera and the driving in
1570880	1572040	Saints 3?
1572040	1575120	The bad camera and the bad driving killed Saints 2 for me.
1575120	1582040	Yes, they fixed the driving, the driving is awesome, really, really fun.
1582040	1585640	Camera I didn't really have a problem with the camera in 3, so I didn't notice if the
1585640	1589720	camera is, I think it's fixed, I mean, like I said, I don't have any problems with it,
1589720	1590860	but the driving is great.
1590860	1593100	So there's no real multiplayer in this?
1593100	1599400	It's co-op, you can do co-op campaign, and then you can also do horde mode, which is,
1599400	1602520	you know, the really ridiculous stuff.
1602520	1604200	You get to be the whore, right?
1604200	1610280	No, it's just a horde mode, some waves have whores in them, some of them you're shrunken
1610280	1616000	down really small, some of them you're really big, just ridiculous stuff.
1616000	1618400	I'm trying to think of some really strange stuff.
1618400	1622400	Oh, I have a gun now that I can fire at a car that allows me to control it like an RC
1622400	1623880	car, which is kind of fun.
1623880	1627040	Wow, that sounds like Driver.
1627040	1632960	You have parachutes that you can use whenever, so you can just skydive off a building.
1632960	1635320	You should have wingsuits.
1635320	1637080	They don't have any wingsuits, unfortunately.
1637080	1638220	Are you having a lot of fun?
1638220	1641480	It sounds to me like you're just able to sandbox.
1641480	1649280	It's great, it's seriously a fun, fun game, you know, yeah, I mean, I'm going to be playing
1649280	1652440	it right here in the show, a little bit.
1652440	1656800	All right, anything else to say on Saints Row for now?
1656800	1661280	Definitely pick it up, it's a great game, I mean, it's worth it, and I've seen some
1661280	1667280	of the reviewers bitching about how the missions were very linear, dude, it's a mission, it's
1667280	1669280	supposed to be linear.
1669280	1671320	I don't understand what they're looking for.
1671320	1674960	There's just so many games out right now, like, I can't pick up Saints Row right now,
1674960	1677160	there's too much, too much!
1677160	1681720	All right, going to my gaming week, I played more Batman Arkham City, which I guess I've
1681720	1685960	already dished on with Jamie a little bit, but I'm just having fun just exploring some
1685960	1689280	of the side missions and trying to do the main stuff as well, and you know, I already
1689280	1693520	talked about where I was at in the game, and it's great, I'm loving that game, it's truly
1693520	1697940	one of the best of the year, it really is, and that's so not the type of game I usually
1697940	1703080	get into, but it's just, a good game is a good game, it transcends that.
1703080	1705960	One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, I'm sure will come as no surprise
1705960	1707200	to anyone, Skyrim.
1707200	1712400	I picked up on Friday, had it delivered on release day, I've been playing Skyrim quite
1712400	1717460	a bit since Friday, and you know, it's very similar to Oblivion, where you can, once you
1717460	1720820	do the very first quest in the beginning, you can pretty much go out in the world and
1720820	1725920	do whatever you want, and I think that openness really turns some people off.
1725920	1728860	And I was really giving this some thought earlier today, it's really funny because we
1728860	1733440	consider Oblivion a role-playing game, and we consider the Final Fantasy series a role-playing
1733440	1736680	game, when in reality, the two could not be any more different.
1736680	1738920	Those games are so, so different.
1738920	1741060	I mean seriously, put them side by side.
1741060	1744760	Final Fantasy XIII, criticized by many for being too linear.
1744760	1749360	I disagree, I think that was kind of a big part of Final Fantasy XIII, it was very, very
1749360	1750360	story-driven.
1750360	1754600	Skyrim, not linear whatsoever.
1754600	1759000	I mean yes, there's a main quest, but there's about 11 billion other things you can do outside
1759000	1760000	that main quest.
1760000	1763400	In fact, now there's this whole, it randomly generates quests.
1763400	1764680	Is this like Fable?
1764680	1765680	It's crazy.
1765680	1766680	No, it's better than Fable, I'm sorry.
1766680	1771800	I meant like, though, in terms of its exploration.
1771800	1775720	I guess, yeah, because some of the more recent Fable games, you kind of go around and do
1775720	1778120	whatever, but it's just even on a bigger scale.
1778120	1782000	It's just I love the fact that in Skyrim, and they've been saying this a lot, you look
1782000	1785240	at the top of a mountain, you can climb that mountain.
1785240	1788240	And anywhere you look at from the top of that mountain, you can walk to.
1788240	1790160	It might take you a while to get there, but you can do it.
1790160	1792640	There might be some mammoths and giants in your way not wanting you to get there, but
1792640	1793640	you can do it.
1793640	1799720	And just so many randomly generated things that just kind of make you look away.
1799720	1805040	And I think in that sense, you know, again, to compare with Final Fantasy 13, there sometimes
1805040	1806960	is a bit of a grind to it.
1806960	1807960	There's numbers.
1807960	1808960	You want to out-level.
1808960	1810400	And, you know, there is a lot of fun.
1810400	1811480	I love Final Fantasy.
1811480	1812480	I'm not dogging that at all.
1812480	1816560	In fact, I think Final Fantasy 13 was really underrated by a lot of the gaming media.
1816560	1818560	I think it's a great game.
1818560	1820500	But Skyrim is just so different.
1820500	1824300	But you can't approach Skyrim like you do a Final Fantasy game, or you're setting yourself
1824300	1825480	up for trouble.
1825480	1828760	And that can be really hard because there's a lot of people where it's like, I gotta do,
1828760	1832440	and I gotta see everything in the game, and I gotta not screw this up because I want to
1832440	1833440	get the perfect ending.
1833440	1837940	And it's like, you can't have that in a game that is randomly generating quests.
1837940	1842560	If you can't put that aside, you're gonna be in trouble.
1842560	1845200	I saw some pretty funny videos for Skyrim.
1845200	1849680	Because, you know, like, one of my favorite things about games is how they're slightly
1849680	1850680	buggy.
1850680	1852760	And Oblivion was slightly buggy and it was great.
1852760	1856480	But I don't know if you've seen the video where you put a pot on someone's head.
1856480	1857480	Yes.
1857480	1858480	Yes.
1858480	1859480	And you suddenly can't see.
1859480	1860480	That's great.
1860480	1867680	Which is funny, because in that video, I recognized it, I was like, oh, I did that guy's quest.
1867680	1872440	By the way, spoiler, if you do his quest to get the dragon claw, you will actually complete
1872440	1874320	a story quest ahead of time.
1874320	1875880	Just throwing it out there.
1875880	1878320	Pro tip from me.
1878320	1880620	But anyway, it's a great game.
1880620	1884040	It's gorgeous to look at.
1884040	1885080	It's fun.
1885080	1888880	You just log in, you can do whatever you want.
1888880	1890560	There's so much to do.
1890560	1891800	So much to explore.
1891800	1894360	That sense of gratification.
1894360	1896200	So many ways to develop your character.
1896200	1897480	You don't pick a class anymore.
1897480	1900120	You're not a wizard or a warrior or anything.
1900120	1903340	It's just, if you happen to use swords a lot, you skill up in swords.
1903340	1906880	If you happen to stealth around a lot, you sneak up, you level up in sneaking.
1906880	1908000	I mean, it's just awesome.
1908000	1910440	It builds the character as you play it, which is great.
1910440	1913520	And then the constellation talentry system is great too.
1913520	1915480	You can effectively make a battle mage.
1915480	1918320	Yeah, that's actually what I'm playing right now, pretty much.
1918320	1921000	Yeah, it's pretty fun.
1921000	1926240	Some of the very minor drawbacks I can think of, and like, you know, there are still some
1926240	1931800	surprising bugs in the game, despite how polished it's, you know, supposed to be after five
1931800	1934560	years of development, some very obvious bugs.
1934560	1940400	Let me tell you, I'm going to say the most nitpicky, crazy thing about a game, like ever,
1940400	1943600	that this seriously is something that I find a little odd.
1943600	1948240	And believe it or not, this is something that's going to appeal to Dark Sakura.
1948240	1951340	It's the design, the menu design.
1951340	1952880	And this is going to be really nerdy.
1952880	1955020	Like the nerdiest thing you're ever going to hear in a game reveal.
1955020	1961500	I find the usage of a narrow sans serif font to be very strange and conflicting to the
1961500	1965960	ambience of what these games are supposed to be about.
1965960	1968640	You know, I am dead fucking serious.
1968640	1973320	Like when I look at it, I'm like this, it has this very modern look to it, but I'm not
1973320	1974460	playing Fallout.
1974460	1979620	I'm playing, I'm not saying everything has to be scripty and ye olde and papyrus and
1979620	1980620	all that garbage.
1980620	1981620	I'm not saying that.
1981620	1984720	I'm just like, it just looks very modern.
1984720	1986440	You saw it, like I made you look at the interface, right?
1986440	1987440	Yeah, I looked at it.
1987440	1991120	It has a very modern look to it, which is weird.
1991120	1998440	You know, for that type of game, I really would agree with you, except that the thinner,
1998440	2004560	the, the, the, the light styles of sans serifs always make me think of a little bit of an
2004560	2011680	ethereal quality, but I, I would have think that it should have been something a little
2011680	2013100	bit more on the script side.
2013100	2017120	It's also that it's the same font everywhere too, which is a little weird.
2017120	2021480	It's like going to target and everything's set in Arial, not Arial, Helvetica.
2021480	2026040	And you know me, I love Helvetica, but sometimes I'm sick of Helvetica, especially after looking
2026040	2028060	at the damn magazine and everything's set in Helvetica.
2028060	2030160	Sometimes you say to hell with Helvetica.
2030160	2031160	To Helvetica.
2031160	2032160	Yeah.
2032160	2033160	Well I'll use Arial.
2033160	2034160	Go to Helvetica.
2034160	2036080	No, I'll use Arial when it snows in Helvetica.
2036080	2040960	But like, well I don't know what the font is in Skyrim, but it's like an Arial narrow
2040960	2043920	and it's like, you know, there's only so much of that I can take.
2043920	2045160	You know what Arial is?
2045160	2046160	What?
2046160	2047160	Poor man's Helvetica.
2047160	2048160	All right.
2048160	2049160	Anyway.
2049160	2051440	Well no, for serious, because Microsoft made that because they didn't want to pay for Helvetica.
2051440	2052440	The end.
2052440	2053440	It's the truth.
2053440	2057460	Um, at least it's not like set in fucking comic sans or something.
2057460	2058460	That's true.
2058460	2059460	That's true.
2059460	2061320	Or Papyrus is another gag me font.
2061320	2062320	I know.
2062320	2063320	I know.
2063320	2072940	But it seemed the look of it made me think that it was a placeholder text and that they
2072940	2075360	just didn't change it.
2075360	2079800	Honestly, this is the most extreme nitpicky thing I have ever talked about in a video
2079800	2080800	game.
2080800	2085080	Otherwise the game is fantastic and do not let my bitching about the font deter your
2085080	2086080	opinion.
2086080	2091320	I don't really care for the, uh, the, the, the high renders of everything in the menu
2091320	2096680	because if someone's running it on a PC, that's going to slow down their time runs pretty
2096680	2098200	decent on most PCs.
2098200	2102320	But um, the other thing I did think was weird was that I didn't like how there was like
2102320	2103440	two different menus.
2103440	2108320	Like there's one menu to bring up your quest log and stuff, but then there's another button
2108320	2112120	you have to hit if you want your map or spells or the constellation.
2112120	2114600	I kind of wish that had all been integrated into one menu.
2114600	2116480	I thought that was kind of just odd.
2116480	2120320	It felt really weird to play and I'm not sure why it was designed that way.
2120320	2124340	I didn't like having two menus because I keep thinking that the map is in the start key
2124340	2125340	and it's not.
2125340	2127280	It's in the O or the circle.
2127280	2128680	So this is weird.
2128680	2135400	Um, uh, to, uh, answer, I wonder who persisted the IKEA font change.
2135400	2136400	I did.
2136400	2140780	IKEA always needs to use Futura forever.
2140780	2142600	This is Typography Lounge Radio.
2142600	2143600	All right.
2143600	2148720	Look, I look, the game is fantastic, but it is a different type of role playing game.
2148720	2156800	It's not for everybody, but if you, if you just, in some ways it's like an MMO where
2156800	2159080	you don't have to deal with other people at all.
2159080	2160080	That's awesome.
2160080	2163920	It has that open world sense to it and there's so much that you can interact with and do
2163920	2169520	in the whole like quests forever type of thing almost feels like an MMO, but without everything
2169520	2172720	that people hate about MMOs, which is other people usually.
2172720	2174200	So and a monthly fee.
2174200	2176600	So but Skyrim is great.
2176600	2178160	Great, great, great.
2178160	2181000	Um, otherwise that's, that's been most of my week right there.
2181000	2183840	Derek Tetsuya asks if it's time for the classic font of the week.
2183840	2187280	I'm much more prone to use the word typeface.
2187280	2190640	I think it sounds a little bit classier.
2190640	2194120	Our comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com of course.
2194120	2195120	All right.
2195120	2200040	That's the, the typeface of the week is Adobe Caslon Pro.
2200040	2201120	Stop.
2201120	2202840	No one curr.
2202840	2205160	All right.
2205160	2208680	We're going to get into some gaming news tonight, of course, with you guys live in our chat
2208680	2211840	room and the calls later on classic game of the week and all that stuff.
2211840	2212840	First some other quick plugs.
2212840	2216120	Again, if you're not already following us on Facebook, you should be facebook.com slash
2216120	2220600	orangeloungeradio and we are on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash olr.
2220600	2222720	We are also now on Google plus.
2222720	2224800	We have a brand new Google plus page page.
2224800	2228540	I know it's a reason to go back and look at Google plus, but um, here's what I really
2228540	2232640	like about Google plus is that because thanks to the whole circle thing, we could actually
2232640	2237520	post things on Google plus that only our listeners could see.
2237520	2241520	So if we ever wanted to do like a secret club, we could post it on Google plus cause it wouldn't
2241520	2242560	be public.
2242560	2246040	So follow us on Google plus, put us in your circles over there.
2246040	2249720	And uh, if any juicy gossip comes up, you know, in the next couple of months we will
2249720	2255020	post it so that only the followers in our circles can see kind of like online only secret
2255020	2256020	club.
2256020	2258840	There's uh, information about the show and pictures and all that stuff.
2258840	2263600	Uh, it's hard for me to give a URL to Google plus cause you can't have names yet, but just
2263600	2264600	search for us.
2264600	2265600	Just type orange launch radio.
2265600	2266600	We'll come right up.
2266600	2267600	It's very easy to find.
2267600	2269640	I'm sure somebody will link it in chat here in a minute.
2269640	2271480	Uh, that's really it for housekeeping.
2271480	2273720	So let's get into some news.
2273720	2274720	Loki.
2274720	2283380	So, um, you may remember DC universe, uh, online went free to play last week and already
2283380	2286720	they've seen a huge increase in subscribers.
2286720	2287720	No duh.
2287720	2294280	Um, there are already up to a million subscribers and a million new players actually, and that's
2294280	2297240	basically a 1000% increase.
2297240	2299480	That's what happens when the game is free.
2299480	2305160	Um, I'm kind of curious though, wonder how many of those are actually paying for parts
2305160	2310040	of the game or just, you know, kind of like, you know, how I would probably be, would just
2310040	2311600	say, I might want to try that out.
2311600	2317040	Well, from what I understand, you can get upgrades to the game for only five bucks.
2317040	2318080	Like there's two different levels.
2318080	2321080	There's one where you can pay like a monthly fee and get all the good stuff.
2321080	2324280	And then there's one where you just pay five bucks and you get a lot of little upgrades.
2324280	2325680	That's kind of neat, I guess.
2325680	2326680	That's not bad.
2326680	2327680	That's not bad at all.
2327680	2331040	Um, I actually watched a friend play DC universe on PS three and it's, it's kind of what I
2331040	2332800	remember from the beta on PC.
2332800	2336320	I don't know if it's, I just, I don't have the fucking time for another MMO right now
2336320	2338120	with all the games out right now.
2338120	2344240	Like, did you notice that none of us mentioned modern warfare three, like the biggest release
2344240	2347000	effort in our gaming weeks at hall?
2347000	2351400	Uh, not that that's the type of game I would usually play anyway, but I, I'm curious, like
2351400	2358200	what makes this game so like, you know, desirable by so many people like the death match.
2358200	2361760	Well, speaking of multiplayer, I would actually like to check out the, the halo anniversary
2361760	2362760	edition at some point.
2362760	2364920	I do like original OG halo.
2364920	2366560	I'd like to check that out at some point.
2366560	2369920	Um, I would like to play Mario three d land Mario kart seven.
2369920	2371400	I don't know if you heard about the halo thing.
2371400	2373600	You know, all those connect features are talking about.
2373600	2374600	Yeah.
2374600	2375600	Yeah.
2375600	2376600	Not at lunch.
2376600	2379800	They, they apparently are having trouble making them work.
2379800	2380800	I'm like, really?
2380800	2386460	You were having trouble making, you know, a voice command to change the resolution from
2386460	2392120	original to like the new graphics or whatever, and also a voice command to throw a grenade.
2392120	2396240	You couldn't make that work at all.
2396240	2397240	Yeah.
2397240	2398240	Grenade grenade.
2398240	2399240	Damn it.
2399240	2402240	It just, it doesn't understand certain accents.
2402240	2407040	It's like, like you're saying grenade grenade.
2407040	2409480	Did you say lemonade?
2409480	2411360	Here's a fresh glass of lemonade.
2411360	2413360	No grenade.
2413360	2416820	Uh, yeah.
2416820	2420240	So um, well I guess that that's good.
2420240	2424400	Maybe some other MMOs Final Fantasy 14 should, uh, follow suit with that.
2424400	2428920	Um, yeah, I think it's going to have to, I'm already over Final Fantasy 14.
2428920	2431080	I haven't touched it in like two weeks.
2431080	2436720	Well Final Fantasy 14 doesn't officially launch until I would like to see the whole 2.0, at
2436720	2440960	least DC universe didn't have to launch a 2.0 you're just getting the game that everybody
2440960	2445440	wanted to play, but no one wanted to pay 60 bucks and a monthly fee to play.
2445440	2446440	I mean, no shit.
2446440	2449400	They got a million people because like tons of people wanted to play this game, but they
2449400	2453520	were like, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for it.
2453520	2459640	There's only, there are so few games that can get away with charging what they do, especially
2459640	2462000	in this day of 99 cent iPhone apps.
2462000	2463000	It's crazy.
2463000	2464000	All right.
2464000	2467520	Well, I don't know how much they'll charge for this, but they could probably charge quite
2467520	2470680	a bit and many people would still buy this to reminisce the past.
2470680	2475600	The Simpsons arcade game has been classified in Australia.
2475600	2481060	What that means is that the rating has actually shown up on the Australian classification
2481060	2482600	board's website.
2482600	2487400	So it seems to indicate that the Simpsons arcade game could be on its way to Xbox live
2487400	2493760	arcade and PlayStation network because backbone is the one that is, I guess, registered the
2493760	2495880	game backbone entertainment.
2495880	2498720	They do a lot of the like classic games stuff.
2498720	2502880	One of the more recent ones they did was the X-Men arcade port, and it is saying it's published
2502880	2504080	by Konami.
2504080	2507680	So I don't know how that all works because I thought EA had the license, but maybe some
2507680	2511440	agreement was reached after all, when the Ninja turtles arcade game came out, they did
2511440	2513440	have a mutual agreement there.
2513440	2515220	So maybe something's been worked out.
2515220	2520360	So we may be getting the Simpsons arcade game on Xbox live arcade very soon, which fuck yes
2520360	2521360	to that.
2521360	2523200	That was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day.
2523200	2527440	I want to say we did a listless sometime ago about like Xbox live arcade game they most
2527440	2529720	need and that was on it.
2529720	2531560	So heck yeah, that'd be awesome.
2531560	2535880	I hope they didn't screw it up, but if it's like the X-Men arcade port, I think it'll
2535880	2536880	be fine.
2536880	2539800	And some of the other stuff they've done has been all right.
2539800	2543680	So, all right, Dark Sakura.
2543680	2546080	Actually I was checking the mailbox again to make sure we actually had something this
2546080	2547360	time.
2547360	2548360	We do.
2548360	2549360	Hooray.
2549360	2554000	So it's been going around, people have been talking about it, about the security breach
2554000	2555000	with Valve.
2555000	2560640	Valve actually did acknowledge that user's personal information had been compromised.
2560640	2563780	There was a security breach.
2563780	2569840	They said that they accessed a Steam database in addition to the forums.
2569840	2575700	That user names, passwords, game purchases, email address, billing addresses, credit card
2575700	2578300	information.
2578300	2582760	They don't have evidence that credit card information or personal identification was
2582760	2587280	taken or that the protection on them was cracked.
2587280	2589400	They're still trying to get into that.
2589400	2595040	But they said, watch your stuff very closely, which is why the only thing that's remotely
2595040	2600000	linked on my Steam account is that I use PayPal.
2600000	2601000	That's it.
2601000	2606000	Well, lucky you, but yeah, my credit card of course was on Steam.
2606000	2607000	Go figure.
2607000	2611760	Actually, I don't think the new one is because mine lapsed during the year and I'm not sure
2611760	2612760	I ever put the new one on.
2612760	2615680	I don't really buy a lot of stuff on Steam and when I do, I just get it through PayPal.
2615680	2617600	I buy tons on Steam.
2617600	2624500	But yeah, I don't know, like you think I'd be more pissed off about this because of what
2624500	2631560	happened with Sony, but I don't know, there's a certain trust you kind of have with Valve
2631560	2635520	because they get so much other stuff and I kind of feel like they're being a little more
2635520	2639480	upfront with this than maybe necessarily Sony was.
2639480	2643200	And I do feel like a lot of the data was probably encrypted pretty well.
2643200	2644680	So I don't know.
2644680	2647760	Well here's a statement from Newell.
2647760	2652560	We do not know of any compromised Steam accounts, so we are not planning to force a change of
2652560	2656280	Steam account passwords, which are separate from the forum passwords.
2656280	2660240	However, it wouldn't be a bad idea to change that as well, especially if it's the same
2660240	2663480	as your Steam forum account password.
2663480	2666800	So I think mine are different.
2666800	2673560	I think also at the end of the day, the fault of this is not Valve's fault.
2673560	2675300	It's the hacker's fault.
2675300	2680140	You know, I don't know what Valve did to necessarily provoke this besides maybe Gabe Newell getting
2680140	2684520	up there at GDC and saying, you know, that it was unhackable and kind of daring people
2684520	2685760	to do it at some point.
2685760	2687800	I don't think that he would do that.
2687800	2690720	But it was, and it wasn't quite the way I'm saying it either.
2690720	2694120	He was just kind of showing about the security protection and all that, the Steam guard and
2694120	2695480	all that.
2695480	2700360	But at the end of the day, these guys weren't in there to steal games and maybe they didn't
2700360	2702100	steal the credit card information.
2702100	2705840	You know, I think Valve is just being very upfront that, hey, that information was at
2705840	2706840	risk.
2706840	2712520	And I don't know, the PlayStation network kind of felt like a Benny Hill show from the
2712520	2713520	beginning.
2713520	2718200	You know, just, it was one person tripping over another from there.
2718200	2722940	But I mean, obviously I'm not like, I'm a little bit upset and I'd like to kind of see
2722940	2727580	what Valve is going to do to make sure that my information doesn't stay at risk.
2727580	2731440	You know, I want to hear more constant updates about what they do, find out about what was
2731440	2732680	taken and not.
2732680	2736240	And if they do suspect that credit card information was taken, then they need to offer a lot of
2736240	2741480	the same services, like the debits and all that, that, that a PlayStation was offering.
2741480	2742480	But I don't know.
2742480	2747720	I kind of trust them to do a better job with their PR than I do Sony.
2747720	2751400	At the end of the day, no one ever had money taken from them on Sony either.
2751400	2758520	So, and hopefully nobody has money taken from them on Valve either, uh, chat.orangelauntrader.com.
2758520	2762240	Some of the comments, uh, salacious pop says the credit card info they got as hashed and
2762240	2763640	encrypted as shit.
2763640	2766120	So they'd have to crack that to do anything.
2766120	2770200	Also steam only lets you store one card on and it's very easy to delete it.
2770200	2773760	Uh, act theft says steam only saves the last card you used.
2773760	2777560	Um, game guru says valve is how you are supposed to address being hacked.
2777560	2781720	Uh, dark Tetsuya says I did change my password, even though I didn't really have any credit
2781720	2784880	card info on it, just at a habit for this sort of thing.
2784880	2786640	And that's a really good habit to have.
2786640	2790280	And if you haven't changed your steam password, you probably just should.
2790280	2792960	What what's, what's to lose from doing it.
2792960	2796420	Nobody's ever given me a good reason why you shouldn't change your password besides I can't
2796420	2798160	keep track of all those different passwords.
2798160	2801320	Well that's, you're, you're going to have to come up with a better excuse than that
2801320	2802440	in this day and age.
2802440	2803440	You know what I mean?
2803440	2806380	Um, Kaijuto has a very good point though.
2806380	2809760	Just because valve is run by nerds doesn't mean they're hack proof.
2809760	2810880	Nothing is.
2810880	2813680	And game guru also puts this pretty clear here.
2813680	2817160	People's been clear and up front, Sony tried to hide everything.
2817160	2818160	That's true too.
2818160	2821880	I do seem to remember that Sony, you know, the network was still up for a few days after
2821880	2824880	and then it was just, it was, it was bad.
2824880	2827680	Chat dot orange dot orange radio dot com is the place where those comments are coming
2827680	2828680	from right now.
2828680	2831280	Cause we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
2831280	2837420	Uh, Khasan in our chat room, K-H-A-S-N says I need to check my credit card transactions.
2837420	2840480	That's all, that's just a good thing to do anyway.
2840480	2845960	Like yeah, this should motivate you to do that, but just, I think check them at least
2845960	2848720	once a week, if not like three times a week.
2848720	2850480	I check my bank account every day.
2850480	2854680	Just a, I like to know how much money's in there cause who actually balances a checkbook
2854680	2855680	anymore?
2855680	2860560	And b, I just like to see that all the transactions that are going through are things that I actually
2860560	2861560	initiated.
2861560	2867040	Well, um, I, before the show I checked my, uh, PayPal just to be sure.
2867040	2869520	And of course there's nothing cause I'm broke.
2869520	2870520	That's good.
2870520	2871520	That's what you want to see.
2871520	2876360	But yeah, I mean the last thing on there was last month when I bought the, uh, the Humble
2876360	2877360	Indie bundle.
2877360	2878360	Ah.
2878360	2879360	That was it.
2879360	2880360	Nice.
2880360	2881360	All right.
2881360	2882360	All right.
2882360	2885560	Well hopefully we'll get more information on that in the weeks to come as to who did
2885560	2886560	it.
2886560	2887680	Hang them up by their balls.
2887680	2888680	Who done it?
2888680	2889680	Who done it?
2889680	2892320	It was Ms. Scarlet in the conservatory.
2892320	2896620	Um, and of course, you know, steam isn't the only thing to get hacked this week.
2896620	2902280	Also the My Resistance website, the official website for the game Resistance, um, from
2902280	2907560	Sony got, uh, hacked as well and their forums are down as well.
2907560	2914240	Um, and basically, you know, the, there's no, uh, it hasn't been immediately verified
2914240	2919520	by Insomniac or Sony, um, whether anything was done.
2919520	2924000	I don't think anything's really compromised other than these people's usernames and passwords
2924000	2929640	and maybe emails because, you know, you don't store credit card information on this website.
2929640	2935120	So, um, basically, uh, yeah, it sucks.
2935120	2936120	Hackers are gonna hack.
2936120	2937800	Yeah, I guess that's true.
2937800	2940200	We have said that before.
2940200	2943400	What did, what do they get from this besides, cause there's no like, it's not like they
2943400	2946480	have credit cards on the Resistance site or anything like that, right?
2946480	2952840	Um, I think what they could be doing is they could be harvesting usernames and passwords,
2952840	2957240	maybe emails and stuff to try to run those against, you know, logins on the PlayStation
2957240	2958240	network.
2958240	2963880	You know, to see if any of those people have the same username, password, login info that
2963880	2966080	they would on both of those.
2966080	2972640	Um, I don't know if maybe there's a way to link your account to, um, that site or something.
2972640	2976560	I don't think you'd have to put your password in though for that, but my, my guess is just,
2976560	2981160	it's mainly just to find username password combos that they can try at a bunch of different
2981160	2986520	websites and see if people are using the same things and maybe get access to accounts that
2986520	2987520	way.
2987520	2989000	All right.
2989000	2992560	Well, more hacking stories on the Xbox.
2992560	2996840	Hackings are still kind of slowly bubbling through the press and so forth.
2996840	2998860	And I've addressed this on a show before.
2998860	3002640	If you forgot, I had 150 bucks stolen from my Xbox back in August.
3002640	3006560	It was about August 14th, 15th or so that that was happened.
3006560	3011280	And I basically lost access to my Xbox for a month while they were investigating and
3011280	3012280	finally got my money back.
3012280	3015840	I think it was about 28 days after the incident had happened.
3015840	3020040	Uh, so I was out 150 bucks for 28 days and that's not something I know everybody can
3020040	3021040	afford to do.
3021040	3022680	Um, so you gotta be very careful.
3022680	3028120	Um, Microsoft refuses that anything is going on, but I know at least 10 individuals that
3028120	3029120	this has happened to.
3029120	3030400	I am not making that number up.
3030400	3033880	Granted, I have a lot of Facebook friends and people on Twitter, but I know at least
3033880	3034880	10.
3034880	3037760	And then I still have people telling me like friends of friends and so forth.
3037760	3041260	So I know that doesn't seem like a very large number, but considering I know people all
3041260	3047440	through the spectrum from people who play games all the time, every day to people that
3047440	3051040	hadn't touched their account in one to two years.
3051040	3053440	That tells me that something's going on.
3053440	3056980	And this shit made me angry this week is I saw that there was a report on Eurogamer.
3056980	3058100	I'm not mad at Eurogamer.
3058100	3059100	They're just reporting it.
3059100	3060100	Don't shoot the messenger.
3060100	3061100	Right.
3061100	3065520	And apparently Microsoft is claiming that all these FIFA ultimate team pack purchases
3065520	3068520	that are the, uh, quote hacks going on.
3068520	3072300	Microsoft is claiming in an interview with Eurogamer from online safety director Doug
3072300	3073300	Park.
3073300	3077620	It is not a hack that it is some type of quote new attack vector quote.
3077620	3078720	It's not a hack.
3078720	3083120	It's really just a different way to monetize stolen accounts.
3083120	3086240	What any service has compromises.
3086240	3087760	Facebook has compromises.
3087760	3089280	Wow has compromises.
3089280	3092420	What they're really doing is trying to make money off those compromises.
3092420	3094520	So FIFA is a very popular title.
3094520	3096840	It's just a new way for the bad guys to make money.
3096840	3098700	It wasn't based on our investigation.
3098700	3099800	We didn't see anything new.
3099800	3101760	It was just a different Avenue.
3101760	3105720	I'm not getting into super detail, but there is basics of account compromise.
3105720	3110480	There's phishing, there's social engineering, there's malware based off the industry today.
3110480	3112000	Most of it comes off malware and phishing.
3112000	3114040	If they get the accounts, they sell it.
3114040	3117120	That's really all they were doing, whether it's FIFA or an account with a PlayStation
3117120	3119700	subscription or an account with a live subscription.
3119700	3122840	It's all basically the same thing.
3122840	3125420	So basically he's deflecting.
3125420	3130980	He's refusing to accept that anything's going wrong at Xbox and you, sir, are lying.
3130980	3134920	You may not know you're lying, but I'm here to tell you that these claims that this is
3134920	3139320	all like phishing and all this stuff, you're full of crap.
3139320	3143720	Wake up because something deeper is going on here and it has to do with Xbox and it
3143720	3148260	has to do with EA because I will poke a hole in this right now.
3148260	3153120	The people that are getting hacked, it's not just FIFA, dun dun dun.
3153120	3155040	It's other EA games.
3155040	3158740	I know somebody that got money stolen out of Madden.
3158740	3162600	I know somebody where the first person that they are, the first game that they went into
3162600	3168720	to go play on it was, um, it was also actually was also Madden in that case, but it's other
3168720	3170360	EA sports games.
3170360	3171640	Look for a class action.
3171640	3176520	It's not just FIFA, although that seems to be the most popular one because that's where
3176520	3180200	they can take the big chunk of money and I guess probably monetize something, but it's
3180200	3181400	happening through other games.
3181400	3183140	But guess what?
3183140	3186360	They're all EA games.
3186360	3193040	Can anyone show me, can anyone show me a game that is that are an Xbox hack that's going
3193040	3196400	on that did not somehow involve an EA product?
3196400	3198400	Can anyone show that?
3198400	3203960	That orange knowledge radio.com twitter.com slash O L R is anyone that's been impacted
3203960	3208800	where there more money has been taken out of the account was an EA game not involved
3208800	3215520	because I'll tell you what I think I know the link and the link is I believe that the
3215520	3222680	people that are getting hacked are people that do not play EA sports games.
3222680	3228880	I've never played an EA sports game on Xbox live save for, um, uh, the burnout paradise,
3228880	3230520	which did not have the EA network.
3230520	3234840	Um, some of the other, you know, like rock band, which isn't a part of that new EA network
3234840	3239240	and all that other people that I know that have been hacked do not play EA sports games
3239240	3244640	online or they have not played their Xbox in several years.
3244640	3253560	If you do not have your Xbox account tied to the new EA system, you are vulnerable.
3253560	3257680	I believe that I don't have any proof, but trending that I see.
3257680	3261840	So I'm just some shmo on a podcast, putting that out there, whatever, take it or leave
3261840	3262840	it.
3262840	3266680	But I'm telling you, I think if you want to best protect yourself, one thing that you
3266680	3270880	should do right now, well, in addition to change your password, which I've told you
3270880	3274340	5,000 times to do, and if you haven't done it by now, I don't know what to tell you,
3274340	3280720	but I think what you should do go download the demo for either NBA jam on fire or need
3280720	3284480	for speed, the run, which granted wasn't a bad demo.
3284480	3287760	When you play those demos, you're going to have to create an EA account to get onto those
3287760	3288960	servers.
3288960	3293000	And now you'll establish a link between your Xbox and your EA account, because I'm telling
3293000	3300740	you, when I got hacked, they linked a fake account up and somehow there's some vulnerability
3300740	3304320	there that neither Microsoft nor EA will admit.
3304320	3308560	But I'm telling you, there's too much of a trend here for me to ignore.
3308560	3312400	As a gamer, as somebody who doesn't want the fans of this show to lose money, I'm just
3312400	3316360	telling you, what I'm seeing in all these other cases are people that have not linked
3316360	3319800	the EA account through some type of sports title are the ones that are being hacked.
3319800	3323200	I don't know how they're doing it, but that's the common denominator, dammit.
3323200	3328100	At the very least, going ahead and associating it with an account would prevent the whatever
3328100	3330680	exploit there might be from being used.
3330680	3333560	I don't think it's necessarily that they're not getting hacked, it's just that they're
3333560	3338000	not buying anything with it, because once they find out, oh, well, I can't get access
3338000	3342700	to the EA thing, then, well, not much I can do there.
3342700	3347000	And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that this bozo would go out there and say that
3347000	3348960	we're all being phished.
3348960	3349960	Because he's wrong.
3349960	3354800	I know somebody that hadn't touched their Xbox in two years.
3354800	3357520	Like I'm supposed to believe that guy somehow got phished?
3357520	3361960	Oh, I haven't played my Xbox in two years, but shit, I'm gonna log onto this website
3361960	3365160	and just give them my Xbox login.
3365160	3367200	Really?
3367200	3369960	I'd like to think I'm somewhat smarter than that, too.
3369960	3375760	I mean, I'd like to think, I mean, I'm not gonna be all Sony, big in the head about it,
3375760	3381120	that I am penetratable when it comes to getting, you know, my information phished or whatever,
3381120	3385640	but I'd like to think, I always think twice about links I click on and websites I'm visiting
3385640	3388260	and make sure the websites are genuine.
3388260	3391720	So if this guy's gonna come out and say that I'm getting phished, you better be ready to
3391720	3394560	throw down, because you might be wrong.
3394560	3402400	And if you're wrong, I'm gonna be double mad.
3402400	3406360	Fifth dream in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrader.com says you'd be amazed how many people don't
3406360	3412140	know the password that their email address associated with their Xbox Live accounts.
3412140	3413140	Get it reset.
3413140	3414280	You gotta do something.
3414280	3418000	Take control of that, especially if you have a credit card tied to it.
3418000	3419200	They're getting in there somehow.
3419200	3420920	I don't know what they're doing.
3420920	3421980	I don't know how they're doing it.
3421980	3426880	If we knew, it would be all over the gaming media, but nobody can figure out how they're
3426880	3427880	doing it.
3427880	3433560	And Microsoft won't admit that there's a problem, because somehow they're both being used.
3433560	3434860	Microsoft and EA.
3434860	3439040	And I don't, I can't figure out how.
3439040	3440680	Somebody's gonna figure it out, though.
3440680	3447560	Honestly, I think they should start looking into their password reset system.
3447560	3450840	I wanna say one more thing about this, because this is the other thing.
3450840	3454880	This guy is deflecting, because he tries to throw all these other companies under the
3454880	3455880	bus.
3455880	3458040	And he says, any service has compromises.
3458040	3459960	WOW has compromises.
3459960	3461360	Okay, true point.
3461360	3463120	I've also had my WOW account hacked.
3463120	3465960	I think I know how that happened, and I do think that was phishing.
3465960	3469560	I think I used, I logged into a computer that I shouldn't have logged into WOW in.
3469560	3470760	So, okay, fair enough.
3470760	3475160	Again, I said earlier, I'm not perfect, it can't happen, okay?
3475160	3481160	But there's a big difference between what WOW is doing and what Microsoft's doing.
3481160	3485360	Blizzard will openly admit that your accounts are vulnerable to theft, that people will
3485360	3488000	try and steal your Xbox accounts.
3488000	3493280	Blizzard will sell an authenticator, so that you can get into your accounts, and try to
3493280	3497760	bring incentives for you to use those authenticators, like free pets and so forth.
3497760	3501480	They've come up with new ways of authentication, like authenticating by phone.
3501480	3504440	They are constantly trying to change the security in their system.
3504440	3505840	What are you doing, Microsoft?
3505840	3510140	Oh, we're watching the situation very closely.
3510140	3513360	On top of that, they give away the authenticator for free, and the only thing that you have
3513360	3515360	to pay for is if you buy a physical authenticator.
3515360	3517200	That's true, they have the mobile phone authenticator for free.
3517200	3518200	Which is what I use.
3518200	3520840	That's very true, good point.
3520840	3522760	Microsoft doesn't have anything like that.
3522760	3526160	Microsoft doesn't tell people to change their passwords regularly.
3526160	3529440	Microsoft won't admit that there's people out there trying to steal money from your
3529440	3530440	account.
3530440	3534680	At least if they're doing it, I'm sure they would come back and say, well, Robin is right
3534680	3535680	here on the website.
3535680	3539680	Okay, on some page, people never look at it, and the font size is not big enough, anyone
3539680	3540680	can see it.
3540680	3545820	It is right there on the login screen, as you're waiting for the game to load, on wow.
3545820	3547340	Protect your account from theft.
3547340	3552500	Do A, B, and C. That's the level of stuff that Microsoft needs to do, because accounts
3552500	3558560	are being stolen, and it's not just because we're all stupid when it comes to learning
3558560	3559560	the internet.
3559560	3563440	Anyhow, I've ranted enough, sorry.
3563440	3565560	But it just irritates me.
3565560	3573240	This is such corporate, you know, just talking out his butt, and it irritates me the more
3573240	3576240	Microsoft tries to deny that anything is wrong.
3576240	3580720	You know what another term for talking out of your butt is?
3580720	3581720	Farting?
3581720	3582720	Furthermore.
3582720	3583720	Or shit.
3583720	3584720	I said I was dumb, but I'm not.
3584720	3588480	Furthermore, maybe it would irritate, I know, I'm a total liar.
3588480	3589760	Dan's in the other room, one liar.
3589760	3593420	It would irritate me a lot less if that, you know, the other part of this is that I was
3593420	3598780	locked out of my Xbox account for 28 days.
3598780	3602480	How long was I out of my wow account when I got hacked?
3602480	3603480	A day?
3603480	3604480	An hour.
3604480	3605480	Okay.
3605480	3609980	Fix it, Microsoft.
3609980	3612800	And have better font.
3612800	3613800	Moving on.
3613800	3614800	Okay.
3614800	3618720	Well, one good thing that they're doing, though, is that Xbox.com lets you cancel your auto
3618720	3621320	renewal for Xbox Live.
3621320	3626680	There is a toggle that you can turn on or off, and instead of them automatically renewing,
3626680	3632400	if you turn it off, then they won't renew, clearly.
3632400	3639960	There's actually, there's also the beacons functionality added in, so that you can say
3639960	3644120	which games you would like to play with other people, and that's actually on Xbox Live now.
3644120	3652400	New messaging, new browsing, new searching for films and TV, that type of thing.
3652400	3657200	And they have a new interface that goes with the Metro UI theme.
3657200	3665840	So I guess that's cool, but honestly, it's not enough, but it's something.
3665840	3670680	Well, it's better than what was there before, which was still having to call support and
3670680	3671680	all that stuff.
3671680	3676600	But by the way, just to throw it out there, certain other subscription things, you cannot
3676600	3679300	cancel online as easily still.
3679300	3681720	So although it may make it sound like there's certain things...
3681720	3682960	And by the way, I tried to go in.
3682960	3686040	The first thing I tried to do, not only did Microsoft...
3686040	3687040	Oh, God.
3687040	3688640	I was so mad at them lately.
3688640	3692440	Not only did Microsoft automatically update my credit card info.
3692440	3693440	Like I don't know what they did.
3693440	3695380	Did they guess the new expiration date?
3695380	3700480	I don't know how they did it, but they automatically updated my credit card information.
3700480	3702640	I can't remove it.
3702640	3706620	You can't remove your credit card on the website.
3706620	3711160	You try to click remove and it goes, you cannot remove this card because you are currently
3711160	3717080	using this card to pay for your one month card of Xbox Live.
3717080	3718360	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3718360	3725680	I can't remove my credit card because I'm using it to fund a prepaid Xbox Live card?
3725680	3730360	No, that's when you report it to the Better Business Bureau.
3730360	3731360	Ridiculous.
3731360	3734400	But Rob, you're paying for the free card.
3734400	3735400	Enough smoke and mirrors.
3735400	3736400	What?
3736400	3739400	I said, but you're paying for the free card.
3739400	3744520	That's hilarious.
3744520	3749280	I mean, not in a funny way, but just I was like, seriously, you guys are going to go
3749280	3750280	that far?
3750280	3756960	So much smoke and mirrors from Microsoft to the point where like I am I am seriously considering
3756960	3758160	the next console.
3758160	3760660	Somebody called me out on Twitter, too, about it, which is fine.
3760660	3761660	That's fine.
3761660	3762660	You know, I have an opinion.
3762660	3765760	If you think there's there's a problem with it, then whatever.
3765760	3770240	But somebody had said, wait, you are mad at Microsoft when PlayStation was the one that
3770240	3773160	opened it got hacked and all that.
3773160	3774160	Fair point.
3774160	3779000	But still, has anyone presented a case where somebody actually had money stole them stolen
3779000	3780880	from them from PlayStation?
3780880	3783880	Has anyone been able to prove that?
3783880	3789080	Because I could prove to you about 10 different cases of money being stolen, many, many more.
3789080	3792660	If you look at the Web forums that are out there on Xbox.
3792660	3795960	Why are we all mad at Sony again?
3795960	3804160	Because of the potential loss, the potential, Rob, we're going to be mad at Sony, be mad
3804160	3809280	at Sony about, you know, them bumble fucking tripping over their own feet and handling
3809280	3810600	the situation.
3810600	3813120	I'm just saying Microsoft's really no better.
3813120	3815560	Well, this is their M.O.
3815560	3818960	I mean, look at what they do with the red ring systems and stuff like that.
3818960	3821080	Oh, it was a small percentage.
3821080	3827200	I was like one percent and definitely not 100 percent or 50 or whatever.
3827200	3828280	So just flip it.
3828280	3829280	That's all I'm saying.
3829280	3831320	The folks that are saying that flip it.
3831320	3832320	Why?
3832320	3838200	Why do you get why do you give Microsoft to pass all the time?
3838200	3842360	Let's be equally critical of all the game companies.
3842360	3843360	We should.
3843360	3844360	Nintendo, why aren't you?
3844360	3848200	Well, we should give them hundreds of dollars, which we do.
3848200	3852520	I have a right to be critical of a company I'm giving hundreds of dollars to.
3852520	3854920	That holds my credit card hostage.
3854920	3858120	But anyway, let's move on release dates.
3858120	3859120	Yes.
3859120	3860120	I love video games.
3860120	3861120	I do.
3861120	3866400	But just some of this some of this stuff I could do without continuing on with the plethora

3879600	3883360	Kung Fu High Impact on Xbox 360 for Kinect.

3998840	3999840	title.

4082840	4084120	big big week.

4181800	4186440	They're actually doing the re-releases now of the Rock Band stuff.

4191960	4193280	out on Xbox 360.
4193280	4194280	That's only 70 bucks?
4194280	4195280	That's not bad at all.
4195280	4200440	Well, it's Xbox 360 and you only get the guitar with, I thought it had the game in there.
4200440	4201440	It's not the game.
4201440	4202440	I get it.
4202440	4205880	It's just DLC.
4205880	4211880	And then, last but not least, Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, coming out one week from today.
4211880	4214920	And, you know, Hole in the Wall is also coming out on the 360.
4214920	4215920	So, that's it.
4215920	4216920	Alright, wow.
4216920	4221020	Well, let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there.
4221020	4222960	It's a very busy week over in Japan as well.
4222960	4225720	These releases are for November 17th.
4225720	4231400	On the Xbox 360, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 in subtitles is coming out on the 17th.
4231400	4237180	Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, The Sims 3 Pets, Saints
4237180	4243080	Row the 3rd, and there is an Xbox 360 Modern Warfare headset that's Bluetooth that's coming
4243080	4248720	out as well as some type of Modern Warfare 3 themed Xbox Live card, because as far as
4248720	4252100	I'm concerned, you should be doing all of your Microsoft transactions right now with
4252100	4254200	cards only.
4254200	4261840	There is also a game coming out called Naorihon no Mago Hyaki Rairaran Taisen that comes out
4261840	4263720	this week from Konami.
4263720	4266640	This looks like...I'm trying to figure out what game this is.
4266640	4270920	I don't know if it's based on an anime.
4270920	4273420	It is a fighting game that's coming out.
4273420	4277980	From the strongest team to defeat the Harugomo Kitsune, that powerful fox spirit has been
4277980	4284200	devouring people and usurping power since the Heian era, and Riko, the leader of Hakai
4284200	4287600	Yayo, the March of 100 Ogres, is the one to defeat her.
4287600	4294100	So it's a fighting game on the 360 that I am not familiar with on this side of the pond.
4294100	4300200	Going to the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty in subtitles there as well, Ninokuni Shiroki
4300200	4304800	Seihai no Juu comes out from level 5 this week.
4304800	4309800	This is a...oh, it's the Studio Ghibli game on PlayStation 3.
4309800	4312200	That looks like it could be very impressive, actually.
4312200	4314720	That looks...ooh, it's all cartoony.
4314720	4315720	That game's very cute.
4315720	4316720	Let me look.
4316720	4317720	Wait, wait.
4317720	4318720	Go back.
4318720	4319720	Look at that.
4319720	4321600	This is the Studio Ghibli on PlayStation 3.
4321600	4322960	That's cute.
4322960	4323960	Yeah.
4323960	4327080	That looks like it would be worth importing.
4327080	4329840	It is Ninokunai.
4329840	4332680	It's a magical land on PlayStation 3.
4332680	4336360	The orphan Oliver is determined to save his mother, who died to save him.
4336360	4341640	In order to do so, he followed Shizuku, the fairy of the tears, into the world of Ninokuni
4341640	4344320	to defeat the evil magician Jabo.
4344320	4345320	Huh.
4345320	4346320	Ninokuni.
4346320	4347320	Huh.
4347320	4349120	Good times.
4349120	4353520	That fighting game I spoke of earlier is out on the PlayStation 3 as well, and there is
4353520	4359000	a whole PlayStation 3 bundle, because they love the different bundles there in Japan.
4359000	4363040	There's a whole bundle around that Ghibli game, so that's gonna be fun.
4363040	4367760	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 there as well, as well as The Sims 3 Pets and Saints Row the Third,
4367760	4370920	all on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
4370920	4377760	Going to the PSP, Angelique Mareno Rokukishi comes out this week, as well as Uminico no
4377760	4383880	Naku Koro ni Portable 2 from Alchemist.
4383880	4385620	Trying to see if that's a game I recognize.
4385620	4388640	It's chapters 3 and 4 of an ongoing series.
4388640	4391520	That is out on the PSP this week.
4391520	4397720	Lastly, cleaning up on the Wii and the 3DS, nothing on the Wii this week, because, you
4397720	4399680	know, Wii releases are kind of dying.
4399680	4405600	Same is true in Japan, but on the 3DS this week, Shinobi 3D and The Sims 3 Pets.
4405600	4407200	That's your Japanese releases.
4407200	4408440	Dark Sakura.
4408440	4413320	In Europe on the 15th, we have, well, this is UK, Assassin's Creed Revelations, I, Pet
4413320	4420480	and Friends, Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, Medieval Moves, Deadman's Quest, and Roshard.
4420480	4429280	And then we have on the 18th, Anno 2070, Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7, Marathon, Need for
4429280	4434480	Speed The Run, Saints Row the Third, Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword,
4434480	4440080	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Apache Air Assault for PC.
4440080	4441080	Sit.
4441080	4442300	Busy, busy.
4442300	4446560	In our chatroom, by the way, they are talking about Ni No Kuni, which I had mentioned before,
4446560	4447560	the Studio Ghibli game.
4447560	4451600	They are saying, some folks, AlphaKananagram says, they did say that it's coming to North
4451600	4452600	America, I think.
4452600	4454640	And Dark Tetsuya says, I thought it was coming out over here.
4454640	4457200	Yeah, it probably is, but not this week.
4457200	4458500	Japan's getting it first.
4458500	4462000	If we're getting it, what, summer next year, maybe?
4462000	4463000	Spring.
4463000	4464000	Spring.
4464000	4465000	Oh, you looked it up, huh?
4465000	4466000	No.
4466000	4467000	I just know.
4467000	4468000	Oh.
4468000	4469000	Well.
4469000	4470000	So we are getting it.
4470000	4471000	It's just, you know, gonna take a little time for the translation.
4471000	4472000	Yeah.
4472000	4474680	We're gonna do a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of
4474680	4475680	the week.
4475680	4476680	But first.
4476680	4483680	Well, everyone's been wondering with the Vita, is there gonna be a way for me to import my
4483680	4487920	games that I may have on UMD to the Vita?
4487920	4488960	And the answer is yes.
4488960	4490720	There is actually a way to do that.
4490720	4496320	And it's not free, but it's a discount.
4496320	4498200	So I guess that's better than nothing.
4498200	4501680	Basically, what you do is you take your existing PSP.
4501680	4506240	You pop in the UMD that you want to register.
4506240	4509880	And it will register on the website, I guess, or on their service.
4509880	4514280	And you'll be able to download the game at a small fee.
4514280	4518120	And of course, they haven't announced prices over here yet, since the Vita's still a ways
4518120	4519120	away.
4519120	4525000	But in Japan, it ranges between an average of 500 and 1000 yen.
4525000	4528320	So it's not bad.
4528320	4531280	That's a pretty good compromise, I think.
4531280	4536720	And you know, really, if you want to abuse that, you could take a friend's UMD or rent
4536720	4539920	a UMD or something like that, pop it in their register like you own it.
4539920	4543360	I mean, there's no way for them to know, but at least you get a little bit of a discount
4543360	4545880	if you're planning on actually buying the game anyways.
4545880	4550240	I still don't like the fact that I'm having to basically put in the UMD to have the privilege
4550240	4552760	of paying for the game all over again.
4552760	4554680	Well, I get it.
4554680	4555680	It just sucks.
4555680	4558600	I mean, the only reason they're doing that is because they know people are gonna abuse
4558600	4559600	it.
4559600	4561240	And because they can.
4561240	4567000	And because really, just play it on your PSP then if you don't want to, you know, if you
4567000	4570360	don't want to pay for it.
4570360	4571360	I guess that's true.
4571360	4575960	Still, wouldn't it be nice if they just had true backwards compatibility, but I guess
4575960	4578000	you can't do that when you change formats.
4578000	4584240	Anyhow, um, so it's gonna be backwards compatible, just obviously you can't, you know, well,
4584240	4586240	it's not really though.
4586240	4590000	Well, there's no UMD drive, big deal.
4590000	4591520	That's an antiquated format.
4591520	4593880	Alright, moving on.
4593880	4596160	What about the digital copies of games I bought?
4596160	4598200	I bought 30 Second Hero digitally.
4598200	4600280	Will I be able to just download that to my Vita?
4600280	4601280	Yes.
4601280	4602280	Okay, then I'm fine.
4602280	4603280	Then that's good.
4603280	4607080	Yeah, all that stuff is tied to your network account and you can re-download it to that,
4607080	4611440	but it's just UMD games, you know, there's no way to transfer that because they're not
4611440	4612440	gonna make a UMD drive.
4612440	4614120	I feel a little better then.
4614120	4619840	Alright, moving on to information about Super Mario 3D Land, which was of course a big,
4619840	4624120	release today, came out today, a lot of people very excited about that, um, I wanna pick
4624120	4627920	this up at some point, amongst all the other games.
4627920	4633480	Here's the thing, it is one of the games I wanna get for the 3DS, but I just don't see
4633480	4637320	myself playing it anytime soon, and I'm in no big hurry, it's a Mario game, you know,
4637320	4640880	I know it's gonna be good, but it's not like, I gotta rush out and go get it.
4640880	4643880	I have been hearing a lot of good things about it, it's getting really good reviews, but
4643880	4648040	it's getting lost amongst all the Modern Warfare and Skyrim chatter, but this is one for the
4648040	4650000	younger crowd too, I mean, all ages really.
4650000	4653560	It reminds me a lot of Mario Galaxy, but just in, you know, the 3DS.
4653560	4654560	And that's not a bad thing?
4654560	4655560	No, it's not a bad thing.
4655560	4656560	Mario Galaxy's fucking great.
4656560	4660160	But anyway, um, there is a help system in the game, a lot of the newer Nintendo games
4660160	4663960	have kinda held your hand a little bit if you constantly fuck up, and Mario 3D Land
4663960	4664960	is no different.
4664960	4668540	Uh, it's been revealed through, you know, people playing the game today, that if you
4668540	4673340	die twice, you'll get a free power-up at the beginning of the level, like a random power-up
4673340	4674340	that happens.
4674340	4680200	And if you die five times in a level, you get a tanooki suit that's basically invincibility
4680200	4681480	the whole way through the level.
4681480	4685280	So it's like, you can't die unless you are just a baddie.
4685280	4690380	Um, so it really will help you handle, I mean, can you imagine if the original Mario Brothers
4690380	4691380	had did that?
4691380	4694020	Like, oh, you're having problems beating World 8 too?
4694020	4695600	You can't get through these hammer brothers?
4695600	4698200	Here, have invincibility through the entire level.
4698200	4702240	That's just why I saved P-Wings and flew over the whole damn thing.
4702240	4704720	So that's, uh, you know, that's where we're at now.
4704720	4707960	Now, here's the interesting thing though, is that you're only allowed to do that the
4707960	4710080	first time you beat a level.
4710080	4714860	If you're trying to go back and look for coins, be a completionist and so forth, you don't
4714860	4716080	get help.
4716080	4719480	So if you're gonna go collect coins and shit, you better do it the first time you have that
4719480	4723460	tanooki suit, cause you won't be getting it again.
4723460	4726280	So that's the help in Mario 3D.
4726280	4731140	Anyhow, uh, what's all this, what's all this newfangled 3D stuff?
4731140	4733420	You remember a time when gaming was simpler?
4733420	4737220	We didn't have all this newfangled 3D Mario Galaxy.
4737220	4742240	No, we had Super Mario Brothers 2D.
4742240	4743240	We liked it.
4743240	4746480	We're gonna travel back to a simpler time where Dark Sakura's gonna get into the classic
4746480	4751620	gaming vault and find a game that she says, hey, hey, I don't wanna hear about your Skyrim.
4751620	4755460	I wanna hear about your Modern Warfare, your 3DSes.
4755460	4758060	I don't know about your Skyrim job.
4758060	4761200	Go play this game because this is classic gaming.
4761200	4765020	I think that you should play the intro to the game.
4765020	4766500	A lot of people are just gonna pick it up right now.
4766500	4767500	They're gonna get it right away.
4767500	4771400	All right, well then let's go right to the intro of this week's classic game of the week.
4771400	4782240	This is an oldie goodie.
4782240	4784820	Or maybe you were like five when this game came out.
4784820	4786140	Well, I said rock on purpose.
4786140	4789540	There have been a lot of hard listeners who were.
4789540	4798660	It's Mega Man X, also known as Rockman X, which came out on Super Nintendo or also the
4798660	4805580	Super Famicom in 1993 in Japan, 1994 in North America.
4805580	4808180	There's PC versions, yay.
4808180	4812860	But this is probably one of the best of the series.
4812860	4819220	So it's like in the future Mega Man X was made by Dr. Light and stored away in a capsule
4819220	4822060	for 30 years and Dr. Light probably died.
4822060	4829260	So this other one named Dr. Cane finds him and, well, he made a bunch of robots based
4829260	4830820	on X and they all went crazy.
4830820	4833220	So basically X has to go stop him.
4833220	4836340	We have zero in this game, it's awesome.
4836340	4844100	So this is what really, I think, where the Mega Man games were really cool, you know,
4844100	4845780	and I've always thought they were really awesome.
4845780	4853500	I think though that having the X series really kind of launched it into the next level, if
4853500	4858500	you'll pardon me for using the phrase.
4858500	4863500	Anyway, as it went through there, we had more characters.
4863500	4870340	Like I said, there was Zero who was brought in, there was Axl, Sigma, you know, as the
4870340	4873180	bad guy.
4873180	4876700	And then, so moving through, there were also, of course, later games.
4876700	4884700	There was all the way up through Rockman, Mega Man X8, I think was the last part.
4884700	4890700	Dan's gonna be the last one.
4890700	4897260	That's what I meant, yeah, X8 was the last one.
4897260	4902940	I had to be sure, well, I was pretty sure, but you know, we've also had different versions
4902940	4903940	of them.
4903940	4910680	There's been Mega Man Xtreme and Xtreme 2, which was in Japan, was called Rockman X Cyber
4910680	4916740	Mission and Rocksman X2, Soul Eraser, which is just a freaking cool name, came out of
4916740	4917740	them.
4917740	4925660	And then, we've also had Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, which was the re-release for PSP.
4925660	4931660	So I mean, basically, he's got different abilities apart from just, you know, the shooting and
4931660	4934420	you kill the robot, you get the power, blah, blah, blah.
4934420	4938980	He can also dash and you can get an air dash later on.
4938980	4941360	Get all these power-ups.
4941360	4945020	You can also charge your weapon too, which is really useful.
4945020	4951420	That means you can also charge your, um, the weapons that you inherit from other Mavericks.
4951420	4953100	So that's pretty cool.
4953100	4958420	And um, they have interesting names, some of these Mavericks, like Toxic Seahorse.
4958420	4964780	But they're pretty much element-based, you know, you get your fire, water, lightning,
4964780	4968900	wind, magnetism, time, all kinds of stuff.
4968900	4973480	So uh, really there's not much else, you know, I can really say about that because it's freaking
4973480	4976420	Mega Man X and if you haven't played it, where have you been?
4976420	4977420	Go play it!
4977420	4980700	There's billions and billions of versions out there to try.
4980700	4984500	Some comments from our chatroom at chat.ownersontrader.com, Hitstun says, actually I played this game
4984500	4986180	on PC first.
4986180	4989380	There was a PC demo that was just the intro stage until Sigma showed up, but I thought
4989380	4990380	it was awesome.
4990380	4991860	I do remember this game on PC, actually.
4991860	4992860	Yeah.
4992860	4993860	There was a PC port.
4993860	4996940	There was an old-ass Mega Man game on PC that was really terrible, it was only like three
4996940	4997940	stages.
4997940	4999660	Anyway, but that's not X.
4999660	5002180	But anyway, uh, let's see.
5002180	5006900	Um, also I got schooled because I said earlier, remember I said back when we didn't have 3D
5006900	5007900	games and all that?
5007900	5010620	Act Def said we had 3D Rad Racer.
5010620	5012980	Aww, I got burned.
5012980	5013980	Burned total.
5013980	5014980	I did.
5014980	5016980	The shutter glasses that came out with the raster system.
5016980	5017980	No, it was red-blue.
5017980	5018980	Red-blue, oh yeah.
5018980	5020980	No, but there was a lasaxon 3D.
5020980	5021980	Yes.
5021980	5022980	Yes.
5022980	5023980	Yeah, the shutter glasses.
5023980	5025540	Alright, so I guess we did have 3D gaming back then.
5025540	5026540	I got told.
5026540	5027660	Dude, what are you doing?
5027660	5028980	Not really in the Super Nintendo era.
5028980	5030260	Are you playing Saints Row?
5030260	5032420	Loki is playing Saints Row with his dildo bat.
5032420	5035500	Are you gonna hit somebody in the face with your dildo bat?
5035500	5040740	You just- Okay, this is terrible radio if I watch this.
5040740	5041740	Good.
5041740	5042740	It's floppy!
5042740	5045020	He literally- Who wants a floppy dildo?
5045020	5049660	He literally threw a guy to the ground and then posed like, hey, like a little swimsuit
5049660	5052020	model pose on the guy.
5052020	5054300	Who- Wow.
5054300	5056340	What's the purpose of having a floppy dildo?
5056340	5060300	You just kicked that fat guy in the crotch and then whapped him with your dildo.
5060300	5061300	They kicked a woman.
5061300	5062300	That was a woman.
5062300	5063300	That was a woman.
5063300	5064300	That was a pat.
5064300	5066300	It was a pat.
5066300	5067300	Alright.
5067300	5071340	Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5071340	5072980	Make a man X.
5072980	5074220	Good pick, Dark Sakura.
5074220	5075220	Good pick.
5075220	5076220	I know.
5076220	5077220	Thank you.
5077220	5078220	Alright.
5078220	5079220	We're gonna take a break, but don't go anywhere.
5079220	5082220	Those of you on the podcast will only be gone like five seconds, but those of you live, don't
5082220	5085080	go anywhere because we're gonna be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.
5085080	5091900	Your emails, which finally came through, phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, rapid fire news,
5091900	5096260	talk of a Tumblr post that's taking everybody by storm, but I'm gonna be a bitch about it.
5096260	5097340	So stay tuned for that.
5097340	5098340	We'll be back.
5098340	5099340	What's new?
5099340	5100340	Shut up.
5100340	5101340	We'll be back.
5101340	5104100	See, we'll be back in just a few more minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5104100	5110940	Don't go anywhere.
5110940	5113740	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5113740	5120900	We are live with the 435th episode of our show on this November the 13th of 2011.
5120900	5124620	And during the break there, I was watching Loki play a little bit of Saints Row the Third,
5124620	5127120	which he has hooked up here in studio, which he's playing.
5127120	5129220	And he's just running around punching people in the face.
5129220	5130800	This game is very purple.
5130800	5134780	Like I know I was getting that in the art and everything, but like the game, the nights,
5134780	5137660	the sky is all lit up purple and the pause is purple.
5137660	5139140	This is a purple people leader game.
5139140	5141660	Well, the reason why a lot of it's purple is because...
5141660	5143340	Is that like your game color?
5143340	5147340	Yes, it's your game color and also as you start taking over territories, you'll see
5147340	5152340	a lot of the lights turn purple and they kind of indicate, you know, that you've taken it
5152340	5153340	over.
5153340	5154340	Gotcha.
5154340	5155340	All right.
5155340	5156340	Well, there you go.
5156340	5157340	Saints Row.
5157340	5158340	We are live.
5158340	5163260	You can join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and comment on some of the rapid fire news
5163260	5164260	we're about to get to.
5164260	5167140	So Loki, you got to pause Saints Row to go over some rapid fire news.
5167140	5168140	Yes.
5168140	5171660	And we'll talk a little bit more about Saints Row because Saints Row 4 has already been
5171660	5177980	out by, you know, the guys over at THQ and not a big surprise because I think this game
5177980	5181800	is going to do well for them, but let's see here.
5181800	5190380	It was Danny Bilson, the executive vice president and apparently, you know, he was saying that
5190380	5195340	the fourth game is going to be even more over the top than the third game and he already
5195340	5203420	knows what the, uh, the premise is about and Saints Row in space.
5203420	5204420	Loki just pointed at me.
5204420	5206220	Well, you think that's it?
5206220	5208580	Let's not, let's get, not get ahead of ourselves.
5208580	5211100	Well, you said more over the top than this one.
5211100	5216900	I mean, like how did the Friday the 13th series end up going like just too far over the top
5216900	5219460	by sending Jason to space?
5219460	5221300	That is part of the DLC actually.
5221300	5230620	It's pimps in space or like a gangsters in space is literally the, uh, yes, it is part
5230620	5231620	of the DLC.
5231620	5235820	I'm not sure if you actually go to space, but it's one of them.
5235820	5236820	All right.
5236820	5237820	Fair enough.
5237820	5238820	Um, so yeah, interesting.
5238820	5241940	Um, and then, uh, this of course this is kind of cool.
5241940	5247840	Uh, they're going to be doing a free to play MMO for the, um, are based on game of thrones,
5247840	5252220	the book and TV series and actually just finished watching the first season of that.
5252220	5257460	So it's kind of cool and it kind of a coincidentally, uh, also Atlas announced that they're going
5257460	5262900	to be publishing game of thrones on xbox 360 and PlayStation three coming up this March
5262900	5264900	if I remember correctly.
5264900	5271580	Um, so yeah, uh, lots of stuff based on that property I guess cause it is pretty, it's
5271580	5272580	pretty good actually.
5272580	5273580	People like that show.
5273580	5274580	Yeah.
5274580	5280020	Um, and then of course, last but not least, uh, dead island is receiving a patch which
5280020	5281900	will do a few things.
5281900	5290740	Also gonna be raising the level cap to a 60 and um, you know, they also included us some
5290740	5296180	new blueprints for weapon mods added, um, infected damage reduce and a bunch of other
5296180	5297940	gameplay improvements.
5297940	5302760	Also some fixes to the interface and just improve stability and network performance
5302760	5305780	and co-op and that kind of stuff.
5305780	5310920	So, um, neat, uh, in our chat room, a chat, I don't know, it sounds really calm or a little
5310920	5311920	bit buffered here.
5311920	5316740	So the chat is just now here in the saints row story and uh, um, orange right in our
5316740	5320300	chat room says pimps at sea.
5320300	5322580	Is there a, is there saints row on the ocean?
5322580	5325340	Is there pirates versus ninjas in saints row?
5325340	5330700	Uh, you can have pirates or ninjas as, uh, well I don't know about pirates, but I know
5330700	5332380	you can have ninjas in your gang.
5332380	5333380	Okay.
5333380	5337060	I was gonna say, maybe that's, that's some of their, they could go with it.
5337060	5340620	I mean you can dress up like a pirate on the high seas, you dress up pretty much like anything
5340620	5341620	you want.
5341620	5342620	All right.
5342620	5343660	All right.
5343660	5345540	And game guru says pimps in space.
5345540	5346540	Okay.
5346540	5348100	I really need to get into saints row.
5348100	5350380	All right.
5350380	5353660	Moving on to, and THQ gives you no kickback Loki, right?
5353660	5355380	You really are just that big a fanboy for saints row.
5355380	5356380	I like the game.
5356380	5357380	It's great.
5357380	5358380	There you go.
5358380	5359380	All right.
5359380	5360380	Uh, I like this game too.
5360380	5364740	It's going to be 13 and it's getting a sequel 13 two is coming out as if there weren't enough
5364740	5365740	games coming out.
5365740	5368220	But the good news is this one's not out till early, early next year.
5368220	5371560	There are going to be some special edition, uh, packages for the game.
5371560	5374340	Now I'm going to report on what's coming out in Europe.
5374340	5378160	However, apparently a lot of this is going to be coming to North America as well.
5378160	5381180	So there is going to be a collector's edition that will come with special packaging and
5381180	5387420	a game, a composer soundtrack, CD, an artwork book, six postcards featuring CG artwork of
5387420	5391900	the characters and a lenticular art print of lightning, who isn't even the main character
5391900	5392900	in the game.
5392900	5393900	So go figure.
5393900	5397420	There's also, I guess, a crystal edition that comes with all that, but instead of a single
5397420	5403460	CD, you get a four disc soundtrack and you get a final fantasy 13 two t-shirt that you
5403460	5405440	can't get anywhere else.
5405440	5408340	And of course, I guess like a little presentation box.
5408340	5411740	So a lot of the same pre-order stuff will be coming to America as well, because Hey,
5411740	5415140	if you're going to, if you're going to spend 60 bucks on a game, why not spend 80 and get
5415140	5417620	a free t-shirt and soundtrack, huh?
5417620	5418620	Sure.
5418620	5419620	Sure.
5419620	5422500	You got to really love that though.
5422500	5426580	There are some other black Friday deals here that we wanted to mention real quick.
5426580	5432300	Uh, at this part, there is, uh, some special bundles coming out and one of them of note
5432300	5435180	is a Zelda 3DS bundle.
5435180	5436900	That's going to be like a special edition.
5436900	5439480	And a lot of these have been cited around the internet.
5439480	5443060	This is making its way to the U S for one 79.
5443060	5447380	It's a black system that comes with the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time 3d.
5447380	5452820	There's also going to be a flare red that comes with Mario 3d land that is both available
5452820	5453820	at Walmart.
5453820	5459140	Uh, apparently GameStop is also going to have a similar, uh, bundle going on, but unfortunately
5459140	5461340	they're not like special branded systems.
5461340	5462340	They're just the regular.
5462340	5467660	Oh, I thought they had the Zelda artwork on, uh, only in Europe and boo, hiss and stuff.
5467660	5472540	Um, yeah, only the plain Jane system when I was reading about that, I thought it was
5472540	5473540	a special.
5473540	5474540	I'm glad you clarified.
5474540	5476980	Uh, some rumors about the next Xbox.
5476980	5481860	Apparently the prototype name is loop, which is good that we have a different name for
5481860	5482860	it now.
5482860	5484140	Cause it's not going to be Xbox seven 20.
5484140	5486380	Why would it be Xbox seven 20?
5486380	5487380	That's a huge assumption.
5487380	5491700	So I like loop that that makes me think that now they're naming these after books in the
5491700	5492960	ring series.
5492960	5493960	So we'll see.
5493960	5496860	Cause Hey, Xbox three 60 had a bunch of rings as their logo.
5496860	5499140	So why not have loop is the next one.
5499140	5500140	Anyhow.
5500140	5504380	I guess as some type of inside blog, you know, take it with a grain of salt, whatever, uh,
5504380	5506700	loop is the code name for it.
5506700	5513940	It's supposed to have all this boosted technology called assistive cores inside, uh, including,
5513940	5518380	you know, graphics, AI, physics, sound networking, encryption sensors.
5518380	5521360	It's supposed to be smaller and cheaper than the three 60.
5521360	5524960	I'm assuming that means when this three 60 initially came out, it's going to run on a
5524960	5527920	modified version of windows nine.
5527920	5529780	That's not too surprising really all things considered.
5529780	5533420	I mean, isn't the Xbox now starting to look more and more like windows eight and some
5533420	5536940	of the prototypes are showing that it's running on windows nine and they're like, some of
5536940	5541220	the rumors I've been hearing are like, it's going to be out next year, either late next
5541220	5545780	year or early next, uh, the, you know, 2013 I'm like, so they're going to go through eight
5545780	5546780	that fast.
5546780	5551860	Well, if it's a modified windows nine, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation there.
5551860	5553420	Um, so who knows?
5553420	5558300	So whatever we're going to have, have rumors galore, we won't have anything solid till
5558300	5561660	eight and I'm not surprised either because I think that they're going to be windows eight.
5561660	5566260	One of the things about that is they're going to do a lot of, you know, compatibility with
5566260	5568580	different arm processors and stuff.
5568580	5572300	So if they're, you know, trying to make it so that can run on pretty much everything,
5572300	5574860	um, that wouldn't surprise me.
5574860	5577540	Why does the chat room think I said Xbox three 60 lube?
5577540	5578540	Did I say lube?
5578540	5579540	He said lube.
5579540	5581940	I said lube lube would be a fun name.
5581940	5584980	I don't know why they're all like, did he say the Xbox lube?
5584980	5589340	Then it would be a smooth move.
5589340	5592420	Now I kind of like the name Xbox lube.
5592420	5593660	We're getting you ready.
5593660	5598020	That'll be the, uh,
5598020	5604580	that'll be the, uh,
5604580	5605580	love it.
5605580	5606580	All right.
5606580	5611520	It's now we are now officially calling the next Xbox, the Xbox lube, especially in light
5611520	5613600	of the recent hackings of money that's been taken.
5613600	5617540	And it seems very appropriate that it would be lubing you up to, uh, have stuff stolen
5617540	5619900	from you.
5619900	5623340	The Xbox lube awful coming in 2013 coming.
5623340	5624660	All right.
5624660	5629140	Dark Sakura, I'm feeling kind of nauseous now.
5629140	5631780	Kaijuto says, I like Xbox lube.
5631780	5633540	The blue Ray will slide in better.
5633540	5636940	So how about some dragon quest 10?
5636940	5639340	If you are in the Japanese beta, you get a free hat.
5639340	5644500	Notice I said the Japanese beta, because it's only the beta in Japan.
5644500	5647540	You have to have a Japanese query mix account to be able to sign up for it.
5647540	5653520	So not Japan sucks to be you, well, it does suck anyway, but anyway.
5653520	5655460	So how about some Bioshock infinite?
5655460	5658380	It's going to have a special move peripheral.
5658380	5666460	Um, it, uh, well it says it will draw you deeper into the version, this vision of a
5666460	5671820	parallel future, blah, blah, blah, um, but we don't know what it is.
5671820	5674100	I bet it's a hose.
5674100	5676300	Actually they confirm that that's not actually happening.
5676300	5677300	No.
5677300	5678300	Okay.
5678300	5681620	Well saints row, the third, how about that dildo that you were playing with?
5681620	5683060	It was floppy.
5683060	5688900	Well, um, for the Japanese version, the penetrator has been censored.
5688900	5694760	The veins and physics from the dildo was meant to be removed because they have stricter
5694760	5697500	guidelines on how you can display a phallus.
5697500	5700100	And I think they also took out the balls as well.
5700100	5706320	Uh, I do not believe the testicles were on the penetrator.
5706320	5708300	This is very serious, Rob, why are you laughing?
5708300	5713440	I'm sorry, they have effectively neutered the weapon.
5713440	5715560	It looks like a purple vibrator now.
5715560	5719400	It's totally gonna throw everything off.
5719400	5723860	My favorite is that all these very serious game blogs had to report, well yes, I had
5723860	5726980	to make the dildo less veiny.
5726980	5727980	You know what?
5727980	5728980	Had to take out his floppy physics.
5728980	5729980	You know what?
5729980	5734080	It would be awesome to have, they gave this out and of course they can't do this out over
5734080	5739440	here because it would be tasteless, but in certain other countries like Denmark and Finland
5739440	5746680	or whatever, uh, they were actually shipping them recreations of the penetrator, actual
5746680	5748940	size recreations of the penetrator.
5748940	5752860	It's a giant four foot long dildo on a stick.
5752860	5753940	On a baseball bat.
5753940	5757480	On a baseball bat that these, uh, blog people had.
5757480	5762320	I would display that proudly if- I'm looking for pictures.
5762320	5763320	Go to Kotaku.
5763320	5764320	Kotaku.
5764320	5765320	Kotaku has that.
5765320	5768360	Oh yeah, because she's got to post them in the Orange Launch Radio Tumblr account because
5768360	5772520	we haven't really been posting a lot over there tonight, so here you go.
5772520	5779540	Alright, um, I wanted to- They show what it looks like in Japan and it's, um, rigid.
5779540	5780540	Very rigid.
5780540	5783320	Beautiful.
5783320	5787320	Alright moving on to, uh, talking about- This is actually from Tumblr.
5787320	5790280	I wanted to talk about this real quick before we get into some long form news because I
5790280	5794040	saw this around Twitter and this is a nice story.
5794040	5797840	I want to share this nice story with you guys and see what you guys think about it, okay?
5797840	5803440	So, um, this- I got to abridge this because I don't want to read this verbatim, but, uh,
5803440	5804440	where is this coming from?
5804440	5809760	I think the original Tumblr user that posted this was iHeartChaos, was the original post
5809760	5815400	of this, um, and it says, I just got back from the midnight release of the game Skyrim.
5815400	5819560	And he's talking about there's a 13 year old boy there and he got a new copy of the game
5819560	5824440	and five feet out the door some douchebag took it, ran off with it, and the kid was
5824440	5826040	obviously about to burst into tears.
5826040	5829840	He'd ridden his bike two miles in the cold at night to get the game.
5829840	5833480	He actually had sold a bunch of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and did housework for his parents to
5833480	5839080	get it and the guy who wrote this said, I had an idea, save my place in line, and he
5839080	5843520	went through the line, told other people about the situation, collected a bunch of money,
5843520	5848280	five bucks here and there and so forth, and he was able to raise the money for a new copy,
5848280	5852280	bought the kid a new copy and the kid was, you know, very thankful about it and so forth
5852280	5854880	and the kid said, do you need anything in return?
5854880	5859280	And the guy says, I told him, young man, I just hope one day you'll do something equally
5859280	5860280	nice for someone.
5860280	5864600	So, you know, it's a very, it's a very inspiring pay it forward type of story, right?
5864600	5867000	So it's very, very nice.
5867000	5871360	Does anyone now, and I read this on Twitter and I was like, that's sweet, but I mean,
5871360	5875560	I'm going to be a bitch here because there's something kind of really wrong with this story.
5875560	5876920	Did anyone else pick up on it?
5876920	5877920	Yep.
5877920	5878920	I picked up on it.
5878920	5879920	What did you pick up on, Loki?
5879920	5882140	I picked up on the fact, first off, it's a child.
5882140	5883140	That's right.
5883140	5884140	In an M rated game.
5884140	5885140	That's right.
5885140	5888040	Loki, I said at the very beginning, it was a 13 year old who rolled his bike and sold
5888040	5890160	his Yu-Gi-Oh cards to get a midnight.
5890160	5891160	Was it a midnight launch?
5891160	5892160	A midnight launch.
5892160	5894360	Oh, his parents are wonderful.
5894360	5898640	If now, this is going to sound really rude, but this is the point when you start to look
5898640	5902840	at, at situations like that, do you go, is this story real?
5902840	5906640	Maybe the story's not real like, and I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say,
5906640	5910600	but I think I have a right to be skeptical because what parent, let's say a 13 year old
5910600	5913560	ride their bike at midnight at night.
5913560	5917560	I mean, I guess there's some crazy people out there, but it does, it does well and see
5917560	5922480	what happens when that, when you do let your 13 year old out at midnight and seriously,
5922480	5925160	why are people like robbing people of games?
5925160	5927400	I mean, that's, I mean, that's that part shitty.
5927400	5931880	Go like steal it from a store or something sadly, you know, and then there's that part
5931880	5936480	and it makes me go, well, you know, that definitely could be legit that somebody is going to steal
5936480	5938680	an X-Box game right out of a kid's hands.
5938680	5941780	I mean, that's really fucking classy, but unfortunately there's some people in this
5941780	5949400	world that are just not have no class whatsoever and would do something like that, but you
5949400	5952880	know, there's also that part of me that's like, but it's a 13 year old trying to buy
5952880	5954160	an M rated game.
5954160	5958400	The game starts, I don't mean to be all spoilery, but within the first five minutes of playing
5958400	5964220	Skyrim, you're going to see some guy get his head chopped off old style execution style.
5964220	5967560	And it's like, do you want your 13 year old to see that?
5967560	5970680	Maybe not like some 13 year olds can probably handle it.
5970680	5976120	I watched red Sonia when I was what, seven, but that was your parents' choice.
5976120	5983600	No it wasn't and you didn't ride two miles in the dark at midnight to go do it.
5983600	5986520	Maybe the parents let the kid did this.
5986520	5988720	Maybe the parents let the kid did this and that's fine, whatever.
5988720	5989720	He's not my kid.
5989720	5995360	But then I go, but the store and effectively allowed this perfect stranger to buy an M
5995360	5997320	rated game for a 13 year old.
5997320	6001940	I mean, regardless of the reason, isn't that not supposed to be happening?
6001940	6004520	That is not supposed to be happening.
6004520	6010760	So now, now my other question is, am I a bitch for my mind instantly going here?
6010760	6016600	Well let me, on a feel good, warm, fuzzy wuzzy, gamers do good story.
6016600	6019640	No he didn't do good cause he, he basically bought the game.
6019640	6025380	He should have, I don't know, whatever, his parents should have taken care of it.
6025380	6030520	So all right, is it wrong that I'm color correcting this picture of a dildo?
6030520	6031520	You're just really bored.
6031520	6033360	All right, wait a minute, you're doing a show.
6033360	6034360	How can you be bored?
6034360	6036760	Uh, because I'm putting it on the...
6036760	6040840	Moving on, let's get to some more gaming news, Loki.
6040840	6048920	So of course, you know, one of the things that's popular nowadays is online passes.
6048920	6054400	And you know, as much as I love Saints Row the Third, this is kind of fucked up.
6054400	6058080	And it's basically with their, their online pass.
6058080	6061560	Okay, I kind of figured that this game would have an online pass.
6061560	6066360	My problem with it is that, say I didn't want to play online.
6066360	6072020	Say I bought the game, cause it has system link, praise system link, awesome.
6072020	6075640	And I want to play with my friend, um, you know, over system link.
6075640	6078240	In order for me to do that, I have to put in an online pass code.
6078240	6079240	That's right.
6079240	6083460	If I bought this game used, and I had no intention to play it online at all, I wanted to play
6083460	6087520	it system link, I would have to pay $10 to get a code.
6087520	6090960	An online pass to play offline.
6090960	6091960	What is up with that?
6091960	6097420	But yes, that is the case, um, you know, they have a screenshot of the actual online pass
6097420	6098420	code.
6098420	6102360	I have my own online pass code, and yeah, you can do it.
6102360	6107800	Oh, and of course, you know, because the comp is early, it's not actually on the site yet,
6107800	6111640	so I can't actually play co-op with anybody yet.
6111640	6113800	But uh, that's fucked up.
6113800	6120680	I mean, I thought the whole point of these online passes, and it's not even me calling
6120680	6121680	it an online pass.
6121680	6126760	It's not like, you know, okay this is an Ubi Uplay thing, this is gonna unlock bonus contents.
6126760	6130260	It says, your online pass code.
6130260	6133320	So if I'm not playing this online, and the whole reason that you're charging this is
6133320	6140360	because online servers cost money to run, then, then basically you're just taking money
6140360	6141960	for the hell of it.
6141960	6144400	You know, um, I don't know.
6144400	6146840	I mean, you should have had system link outside of it.
6146840	6148960	Now, here's why they don't have system link outside of it.
6148960	6152380	Because they know this game's gonna get pirated, and they also know that there are ways that
6152380	6158100	you can play online co-op with somebody else via system link.
6158100	6162540	And that's why they put this behind a code, because if they're gonna at least make some
6162540	6167540	money off this pirated copy, if you're gonna play online and play co-op, whether it be
6167540	6170720	through system link or whatever, then they're gonna make $10 off it.
6170720	6172440	That's the true reason why it's like this.
6172440	6177120	But still, for legitimate people that, you know, wanna play this game, say buy it used
6177120	6178120	or whatever.
6178120	6182680	It's a further case of legitimate buyers getting screwed over, anti-piracy measures that'll
6182680	6184160	get hacked to shit anyway.
6184160	6188720	Yeah, I mean, because I agree this game's awesome, and you should buy it, and, you know,
6188720	6193240	if you can buy it new, great, because I think you should play it sooner than later, but
6193240	6197440	not everyone can buy it new, and you shouldn't be expected to have to pony out, you know,
6197440	6200520	money for something that maybe you're not sure that you'd like it or something.
6200520	6204200	Well, granted, but when you do buy the game new, you don't, I mean, we have to remember
6204200	6207480	that online passes don't affect those that buy new.
6207480	6213760	Yeah, but it's still, it still ain't, well, and actually, no, it does kind of affect me
6213760	6217880	if buying it new, because I plan a lot of different systems that work, so if I wanna
6217880	6224640	play system link co-op now, I can only play on my system, and, you know, I'd have to get
6224640	6226140	another copy new.
6226140	6229440	You can't, like, download the data to USB and then go to a friend's house and put the
6229440	6230440	USB in there?
6230440	6231440	No.
6231440	6232440	Oh, wow.
6232440	6233440	I don't think so.
6233440	6234440	I think it's tied to your system.
6234440	6235440	Could it be tied to your account?
6235440	6236440	It might be tied to your account.
6236440	6237440	You might be able to do it.
6237440	6238440	Yeah.
6238440	6242080	Even still, though, I would have to log in online anyways to play system link, you know,
6242080	6244240	because you have to download, it's DLC, basically.
6244240	6245240	Oh, yeah.
6245240	6247800	So DLC is usually tied to your system.
6247800	6248920	Right.
6248920	6252400	And you can't play the same account on two systems to system link, can you?
6252400	6253400	No.
6253400	6254700	Ah, see, that's the trick.
6254700	6258640	So you are kind of getting screwed in that regard.
6258640	6260040	Yep.
6260040	6266080	Hmm, well, it's a, it's a good thing to know before the game comes out, I think, especially
6266080	6269120	for people who might be considering buying it, waiting to get it used or whatever.
6269120	6270440	Well, and here's the thing, though.
6270440	6273580	They didn't tell anybody it was gonna have this.
6273580	6278600	It was just, it happened to be a reviewer or whatever said, hey, it has an online pass.
6278600	6279600	It's something to report on.
6279600	6283960	They didn't tell, you know, anybody, like, if that reviewer hadn't said anything, you
6283960	6287080	know, I'm sure, obviously, it's gonna get out there early and people would say something,
6287080	6290760	but let's just say, devil's advocate here, that no one said anything.
6290760	6292400	THQ would have not said anything.
6292400	6294320	You would get home with your copy of the game.
6294320	6297400	You're like, what the fuck is this?
6297400	6298400	And they already have your 60 bucks.
6298400	6301840	But now you're getting used, you're getting used to seeing those things in every game.
6301840	6307640	Yeah, but, and I have no problem with games that, you know, if they want to charge that
6307640	6312240	because they're saying, okay, well, we need to fund our servers or whatever the case may
6312240	6315440	be, you know, and it's an online game.
6315440	6318320	I have a problem with it on Xbox 360.
6318320	6321700	I'm already paying 50 bucks a month for that.
6321700	6324480	Why is, why are Microsoft games allowed to charge for this?
6324480	6331080	And now, granted, Microsoft first party games haven't done it because they know better because
6331080	6335760	we're gonna go apeshit on them when they try to pull that shit because that's true double
6335760	6337240	dipping right there.
6337240	6340240	But right now, it's really only the third parties that are doing it.
6340240	6344200	And now Sony, but Sony, you know, Sony's online thing is free already.
6344200	6350960	I mean, I give this way more justification on the PlayStation than I do on the Xbox because
6350960	6353760	I'm already paying 50 bucks a month to play online on the Xbox.
6353760	6354960	Yeah.
6354960	6359160	That's kind of what pisses me off about the online pass in that regard.
6359160	6364120	But anyhow, rumors abound that a new Zelda game is on its way.
6364120	6371520	It's being made for the 3DS series producer, Eiji Onuma, talked to a Portuguese website,
6371520	6376240	My Games, and said the following, quote, we are already preparing a new game, a game in
6376240	6380600	the series for the Nintendo 3DS, but don't think that it is a direct sequel to the Zelda
6380600	6382480	titles released on DS.
6382480	6387280	We are talking about a new game, but it takes much of what has been done on previous handhelds.
6387280	6390560	Some folks are saying, is this sort of Majora's Mask?
6390560	6392160	I'm actually thinking no.
6392160	6396520	I think, you know, I'm kind of reading really a lot into this, but I think it's definitely
6396520	6398840	a new Zelda title, which kind of seems like a duh.
6398840	6402280	There's gonna be the major Nintendo franchises, but look at everything that's kind of been
6402280	6403280	leading up to this.
6403280	6408060	You know, Nintendo has been talking about, yeah, we need more big releases on the 3DS,
6408060	6412160	and we have some things that are coming in 2012 that we're not ready to announce yet.
6412160	6418600	I think Zelda 3DS is probably the big thing that's being unveiled next E3 on the 3DS.
6418600	6422600	I mean, duh, right?
6422600	6426880	It's gonna be some big first party game, and if they're gonna refuse to give me F-Zero
6426880	6431840	another year, then it's gonna be probably Zelda.
6431840	6433640	Most likely.
6433640	6435560	This doesn't surprise me at all.
6435560	6437820	And I don't want it to be Majora's Mask.
6437820	6442660	I get that some people want that remade too, whatever, fine, but I think I'd rather just
6442660	6443800	have a new Zelda game.
6443800	6447100	Why not a new experience?
6447100	6451500	The Mario game's apparently pretty good, so they're capable of taking the old franchises
6451500	6453000	and making them fun in 3D.
6453000	6455480	Why not Zelda?
6455480	6457200	I'm sure it'll be a new game.
6457200	6458200	It'll be cool.
6458200	6460840	Hopefully it won't take five years to develop.
6460840	6462180	We'll see though.
6462180	6464080	Let's get to the mailbag.
6464080	6469400	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer's
6469400	6475040	gonna dive into the email bag and pick out the one email that came in this week that's
6475040	6476040	worth reading.
6476040	6478640	Well, we have all the rest of those, fam.
6478640	6479640	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
6479640	6483300	Now, I realize a lot of you have been busy playing Modern Warfare and Skyrim and Mario
6483300	6485520	and so forth, but let's make her work next week.
6485520	6489280	We want to hear no opinions on the panel tonight about Modern Warfare.
6489280	6491480	I need emails on Modern Warfare.
6491480	6494440	Tell me why this sold nine million copies or whatever the first day.
6494440	6495440	I need to understand.
6495440	6496840	I'm not hating on the game.
6496840	6497840	I just want to know.
6497840	6498840	Hater.
6498840	6499840	I'm not hating on it.
6499840	6500840	It's just not my type of game.
6500840	6501840	Hater's gonna hate.
6501840	6504440	But I want to know why other people get so riled up about it.
6504440	6505440	Can I read the email?
6505440	6506440	Yes.
6506440	6507440	Hey, Orange Loungers.
6507440	6508680	It's Jim Sally.
6508680	6510440	I live for holiday deals.
6510440	6515120	I've gotten everything from cheap games online and stood in line for big screen TVs.
6515120	6517640	What's the best holiday deal you ever got?
6517640	6523800	Once I bought an original, I said original, original Xbox 5.1 sound system for $75 on
6523800	6526520	Boxing Day because it was a return.
6526520	6530080	At least the guy in the parking lot with his trunk open said so.
6530080	6531080	Mmm.
6531080	6532080	Thanks, guys.
6532080	6533480	Sundays are orange forever, Jim Sally.
6533480	6538360	Yeah, I'd recommend never buying something out of a trunk, not that I would ever do that.
6538360	6544520	Actually, no, I have never done that, so, but, you know, they tend to sell you stereo
6544520	6551440	systems that are actually brick painted black and stuff like that, so, you know.
6551440	6556120	I would say the best holiday deal I ever got was my HDTV for $600.
6556120	6559160	Keep in mind, this was in the year, I think, 2004.
6559160	6563380	I got it at Costco, and it was back when HDTVs were not flat.
6563380	6566120	They had the giant backs like the old school TVs still.
6566120	6567920	That thing was heavy as hell.
6567920	6569640	That was a big TV.
6569640	6573200	Did I get that when I was living with you, Loki, or was that, that was when I was living
6573200	6574200	with Extifer.
6574200	6580680	I finally got that, but that was only $600, which then was, like, dirt cheap for an HDTV.
6580680	6583120	I don't know if you remember that TV the other time.
6583120	6586560	You know where you can see that TV?
6586560	6592200	It's in the news report that Channel 3 did on us that somebody put up on YouTube.
6592200	6594280	You're playing DDR on that old TV.
6594280	6597280	Let me see if I can find it.
6597280	6598280	Yeah.
6598280	6599280	This is a good time to revisit that on YouTube, too.
6599280	6602520	I thought I was playing DDR on, uh- You were playing on the cabinet.
6602520	6603520	On the cabinet?
6603520	6604520	Yeah, you were playing on the cabinet.
6604520	6605520	No, no, no.
6605520	6606520	That was when The B did the article.
6606520	6612040	That was the Sacramento B. Well, the one with the rock band, not rock band, but guitar hero
6612040	6613040	was here at my house.
6613040	6614040	No, no.
6614040	6616080	He's talking about the, uh- On my old TV.
6616080	6622400	Don't you remember the, don't you remember the It's So Much Fun story that led to that
6622400	6623400	whole thing?
6623400	6625280	Don't you remember that?
6625280	6626280	That was, oh, look.
6626280	6627280	I found it.
6627280	6628280	I found it here.
6628280	6629280	It's still on YouTube.
6629280	6630280	Look at this.
6630280	6635280	We're joining the podcasting craze that's becoming a web craze, but what is it?
6635280	6636280	How does it work?
6636280	6642000	KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain,
6642000	6644200	and share their thoughts with the world.
6644200	6646760	It's Jamie Speed.
6646760	6650800	It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game-
6650800	6651800	There.
6651800	6652800	There's the ginormous TV.
6652800	6653800	Remember that guy?
6653800	6654800	Yeah.
6654800	6655800	I got that for 600 bucks.
6655800	6657560	That was a steal back then.
6657560	6660080	October 9th, 2006, but anyway.
6660080	6665320	Now that I have this up- I was thinking of the Wega, but the Wega was, um, dude's TV.
6665320	6667420	Now that we're, this is a five-year-old clip now.
6667420	6668420	Now I want to watch the rest of it.
6668420	6669420	No, I don't want to watch it.
6669420	6675480	It started off tiny and it's grown.
6675480	6676480	That's what she said.
6676480	6678480	No, we're not playing this.
6678480	6682120	No, I gotta hear that again.
6682120	6685080	It started off tiny and it's grown.
6685080	6690480	A subculture of pop culture, and these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming
6690480	6691480	fans.
6691480	6692480	A cliche thing.
6692480	6696480	That's a cliche thing.
6696480	6700400	Hello everybody once again, and welcome to-
6700400	6704960	Remember that ginormous green chair we had randomly in the old studio in the Extrofer
6704960	6705960	apartment?
6705960	6706960	The one I would sleep in sometimes?
6706960	6708360	Oh my God, that chair is gigantic.
6708360	6709360	Anyway, sorry.
6709360	6715120	...of our podcast from their apartment in Rancho Cordova using revolutionary technology.
6715120	6716120	Oh my God.
6716120	6718560	That was my old laptop that's in the garage now.
6718560	6720240	Look how young we are in this picture.
6720240	6721400	Like especially look at Loki.
6721400	6723960	Like he looks so much younger in this clip.
6723960	6724960	And I had hair.
6724960	6725960	It's amazing.
6725960	6726960	I look the same.
6726960	6727960	I bet we will do that to you.
6727960	6728960	Except your hair is shorter.
6728960	6729960	And it's a different color.
6729960	6730960	...for the world.
6730960	6737240	We basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really
6737240	6738240	want to know.
6738240	6743000	Using a computer, podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number
6743000	6745520	of websites now hosting the shows.
6745520	6751400	Now anyone can create, edit, and air their ideas, concerns, music, and all things audio
6751400	6753840	to anyone else willing to download it.
6753840	6755480	It's something they can take with them.
6755480	6759260	It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.
6759260	6764120	With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.
6764120	6768160	I love that they just interviewed some random dude bro, like who had his iPod with him.
6768160	6769760	He's skating down the street.
6769760	6774480	People can talk about things they like to talk about and other people can join in and
6774480	6775480	listen to.
6775480	6778980	And it's really open and lots of people can get into it.
6778980	6782060	A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free.
6782060	6786700	The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes.
6786700	6791480	You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature, and a list of
6791480	6794200	available podcasts are at your fingertips.
6794200	6795200	Free for you.
6795200	6796500	Free for the producers.
6796500	6798880	Free speech for everyone.
6798880	6799880	It's so much fun.
6799880	6800880	It's great.
6800880	6804480	They can go eat a dick, okay?
6804480	6805480	Interview me for a minute and a half.
6805480	6807440	Let's play this two-second clip.
6807440	6809960	They never show Loki's name, his real name.
6809960	6814120	They never show anything but that one little clip, oh, it's so much fun.
6814120	6818120	And then me talking about something a little more profound.
6818120	6819520	Free for the producers.
6819520	6821920	Free speech for everyone.
6821920	6822920	It's so much fun.
6822920	6826600	It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be
6826600	6829360	heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.
6829360	6831720	So podcasting is just wonderful.
6831720	6835360	In Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 reports.
6835360	6837360	I got to say more than everybody.
6837360	6838360	That was kind of cool.
6838360	6841480	Recently, Governor Schwarzenegger began providing his weekly radio address as a podcast.
6841480	6846600	It can be downloaded, so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're
6846600	6848920	pumping iron in the gym.
6848920	6849920	That's right.
6849920	6851960	We were mentioned in the same breath as Governor Schwarzenegger.
6851960	6855560	Yes, he really was the governor of California, if you weren't aware, he really, really was
6855560	6856560	the governor.
6856560	6859600	Did you notice that overhead cam shot trying to get my boobs?
6859600	6860600	Seriously.
6860600	6862800	The cameraman fancied you.
6862800	6863800	Whatever.
6863800	6866000	It's just because I'm a girl.
6866000	6868080	And by the way, here's my favorite.
6868080	6871180	Here's my favorite thing about that whole story.
6871180	6874320	Our show is never named.
6874320	6878920	They never say they don't want to have free advertising ever said, but when you when you
6878920	6882000	watch him search, he's searching for Orange Lounge Radio.
6882000	6883840	That was the shout out we got.
6883840	6887240	But never did they say these three guys produce a show called Orange Lounge Radio.
6887240	6888240	Nope.
6888240	6889880	They play DDR and it's so much fun.
6889880	6896000	And it's it started off tiny and it's grown.
6896000	6898200	Cutting edge technology.
6898200	6900560	These failed, crappy laptops.
6900560	6903880	These guys are doing what Governor Schwarzenegger is doing.
6903880	6905560	Pumping iron.
6905560	6907560	Doing drugs.
6907560	6915120	We are not making poor decisions.
6915120	6916120	All right.
6916120	6917120	Let's move on.
6917120	6918120	Is that it for e-mails?
6918120	6919960	Oh, holiday deals.
6919960	6924440	We never we took a trip down memory lane and just totally ignored Jim Sally's one more
6924440	6925440	e-mail.
6925440	6926440	I mentioned the TV.
6926440	6928240	Did anybody else get any really good holiday deals?
6928240	6929240	They can remember.
6929240	6930240	I don't remember.
6930240	6931240	I don't care.
6931240	6937920	I used to buy like different like media and stuff, you know, like seedy blanks and stuff
6937920	6944120	like that, because they usually have some good deals on those, at least during the holidays.
6944120	6949160	That was the only thing I could see you'd like going to like Best Buy or something for.
6949160	6950720	All right.
6950720	6954640	Mail bag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some e-mails in the future.
6954640	6955640	All right.
6955640	6958640	After that trip down memory lane, I'm sure that's going to ignite some fury amongst some
6958640	6959640	people.
6959640	6964640	That's going to be part of the show we call the FUs of the week.
6964640	6984680	I don't know, I guess just to feeling crappy.
6984680	6989560	Yeah, F you to feeling crappy and F you to shame.
6989560	6991880	Why is he getting an F you?
6991880	6996040	Because I've listened to like a lot of Manson and every time I can't help it.
6996040	6999440	He's got me liking a group that I can't get any new stuff from anymore.
6999440	7000440	Oh yeah.
7000440	7001440	Didn't they like break?
7001440	7004880	They broke up years ago, but I just recently heard of them.
7004880	7005880	Thanks to him.
7005880	7006880	That group died, too.
7006880	7013760	I don't know, but I'm mad at Shane only marginally, and I'm also mad at Shane for not catching
7013760	7015880	up on Supernatural.
7015880	7017920	So I can't talk to him about it.
7017920	7018920	Sorry.
7018920	7019920	This is our chat room.
7019920	7023040	Cause we were talking about the similarities between orange launch radio and governor Schwarzenegger,
7023040	7024040	right?
7024040	7028640	Kossin in the chat says, which one of the OLR hosts diddled the maid and salacious pop
7028640	7032820	follows that up saying, is OLR going to suddenly reveal a 10 year old offspring from a Latina
7032820	7036040	domestic servant because that's something governor Schwarzenegger did.
7036040	7037520	The show is the right age.
7037520	7039520	We got really drunk after our second episode.
7039520	7040520	Don't ask how this happened.
7040520	7044480	Hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, physically capable of that.
7044480	7045480	So shut up.
7045480	7050680	No, I Loki or I could have boinked a maid, but, oh, that's right.
7050680	7052760	I'm not a Latina maid.
7052760	7054760	You definitely are not a Latina maid.
7054760	7055760	Please.
7055760	7057000	All right.
7057000	7058000	FUs of the week.
7058000	7059000	Uh, Loki.
7059000	7063640	Um, I would say my, if he goes through those people, I know I'm not sure if you've seen
7063640	7068280	these, but they have these little signs that show how fast you're going and stuff like
7068280	7069280	that.
7069280	7072600	It's, you know, kind of a reminder to do the speed limit or under the speed limit.
7072600	7075640	I always, always speed up when I see them.
7075640	7079720	Well, I see people like see those signs and they like slam on their brakes.
7079720	7082000	I'm like, dude, it's a fucking sign.
7082000	7083400	It's not going to write you a ticket.
7083400	7084720	It's a sign.
7084720	7089680	That's all it does is it showed you how fast you're going and not accurately by the way.
7089680	7093700	My favorite thing to find out with those signs is how high it will track you before it starts
7093700	7096160	getting angry and starts blinking.
7096160	7099080	Like I always like to see like, what's the speed limit where it starts flashing, slow
7099080	7100820	down asshole.
7100820	7105920	So yeah, so I feed those people that think signs are real people that are going to write
7105920	7106920	them tickets or something.
7106920	7108120	It doesn't have a magical camera on it.
7108120	7112480	I'm sure someday the signs will be able to write you a ticket and governments are hard
7112480	7113800	up enough for the money.
7113800	7114800	I guess.
7114800	7115800	All right.
7115800	7120720	Uh, my FU of the week goes to the headache I had today because headaches are terrible
7120720	7124480	and yeah, it made me want to nap all day forever.
7124480	7126720	Does it make you feel better Rob?
7126720	7128360	What the giant purple dildo?
7128360	7129360	No.
7129360	7132840	It does not make me feel better.
7132840	7135360	I kind of want one.
7135360	7136920	I'd hang it up in the studio.
7136920	7137920	Sure.
7137920	7138920	I would.
7138920	7141120	All right, let's move on with some more stories.
7141120	7146680	The Skype line coming up soon, but first more news Loki studio sext engines, same difference.
7146680	7152480	Um, so apparently, you know, we were talking a little bit about online passes and stuff.
7152480	7158800	And one of the things that the online passes, if you want to call them that, um, do is basically
7158800	7167000	the deter use game sales and um, but there's a report that's out that's saying that basically
7167000	7172960	used in digital sales actually make up about 35% of total console spending and that's very,
7172960	7176720	you know, it makes sense, you know, with a lot of the stuff nowadays, you know, available
7176720	7183000	on the Xbox 360, uh, marketplace or, you know, the PlayStation network or even, you know,
7183000	7189040	WiiWare stores and steam and whatever, um, it's not surprising that it would be about that much.
7189040	7194360	Um, they're also saying that, um, you know, they show that 23% of the consoles purchased,
7194360	7200420	um, or console games purchased in the US are used and says slightly more in, uh, than the
7200420	7201840	European market were.
7201840	7203200	That's about 20%.
7203200	7211400	Also, uh, digitally, um, just digitally distributed titles rank lower in both regions, I guess,
7211400	7216200	taking up 12% of console market in America and nine in Europe.
7216200	7222680	And also, I guess they're saying that the 12% that actually is approximately $960 million
7222680	7225800	worth of content that's being purchased right there.
7225800	7231840	Um, and, uh, they're saying that also 54% of American console owners are spending an
7231840	7235800	average of $49 a year on console downloads.
7235800	7236800	Hmm.
7236800	7241440	And then, of course, uh, you know, talking a little bit about PC and you would kind of
7241440	7245600	think that PC is going to be skewing more towards the digital side.
7245600	7246600	Actually that's true.
7246600	7253320	They're saying that 58% of all PC gaming dollars are spent digitally on games or DLC.
7253320	7255320	So that's the way it's going in the PC market.
7255320	7257480	Not so much in the console market.
7257480	7260560	Not surprised because you see PC retail shelves really dry.
7260560	7261560	Oh yeah.
7261560	7262560	Like it's not a surprise at all.
7262560	7267920	In fact, now even, I mean, I know we don't talk a lot about gaming on the Mac, but you
7267920	7272240	know, the app store delivery is like the big thing on the Mac now.
7272240	7275400	They didn't even sell the latest OS upgrade like through the app store.
7275400	7276400	I think so.
7276400	7277400	Yeah.
7277400	7278400	I haven't had a Mac in a long time.
7278400	7282120	In fact, I gave my Mac to dark soccer who I guess just recently gutted it over the weekend
7282120	7286240	or I'm actually going to be doing a reformat on it.
7286240	7287240	It won't run Linux yet.
7287240	7289160	What exactly are you going to do with that thing?
7289160	7292640	I'm actually going to talk to people I know to take it apart and see about fixing the
7292640	7298640	DVD, the DVD player and seeing what I can do to get Linux on it and make it do your
7298640	7299640	evil bidding.
7299640	7305760	But I want, there's a version of Linux that's meant to run on a Mac and mirror Mac OS only
7305760	7308240	use a lot less memory and be a lot more efficient.
7308240	7309880	Then she's going to install the grid on it.
7309880	7310880	End of line.
7310880	7313880	And then I'll move in.
7313880	7316300	All right.
7316300	7319520	But anyhow, only 35% huh, you would think with all these online passes and everything
7319520	7320520	it was much higher.
7320520	7321520	It doesn't seem so bad.
7321520	7329120	No, cause I think the majority of, you know, cause you're looking at dollars and the majority
7329120	7332080	of the stuff that's purchased online would be cheaper.
7332080	7335360	And also a lot of, a lot more people are, you know, lined up to go to the stores to
7335360	7336360	buy stuff.
7336360	7341560	And also not a lot of stuff is like day and date with, you know, games on, you don't have
7341560	7348400	it yet where you can buy, you know, call of duty at midnight on, you know, as a digital
7348400	7349400	download.
7349400	7352040	And I would be willing to bet if they did that, you'd probably see a lot of people going
7352040	7353040	that route.
7353040	7358400	Well, steam did launch Skyrim where you could download, you know, you preload the game and
7358400	7360080	then you unencrypted at midnight.
7360080	7363680	Like they did do that for Skyrim and I think they've done it for other big games too.
7363680	7368800	So like steam does that a lot, but um, I'm seeing as far as like console stuff goes,
7368800	7371800	um, you don't see that.
7371800	7372800	That's true.
7372800	7373800	You don't see consoles yet.
7373800	7374800	Yet.
7374800	7375800	Yeah.
7375800	7377680	Wait, wait for the Xbox lube.
7377680	7382280	Cause it's going to give the lube, it's going to lube up GameStop because uh, I bet a lot
7382280	7385380	of these new consoles are going to go very, very heavy on digital distribution.
7385380	7388800	So like GameStop can bend over.
7388800	7389800	All right.
7389800	7391800	Well, you all right?
7391800	7392800	Nothing.
7392800	7393800	Just listening to what Dan's playing.
7393800	7394800	All right.
7394800	7395800	What is he playing?
7395800	7396800	Saints Row III.
7396800	7397800	Oh, nice.
7397800	7398800	Uh, moving on.
7398800	7403600	Uh, one of the biggest complaints about the Wii U when it was announced to E3 this year
7403600	7404840	is what?
7404840	7408520	All the games will only work with the one controller, you know, because the, I guess
7408520	7412680	the system that was not capable when they showed it at E3 of running games on multiple
7412680	7413680	controllers.
7413680	7418000	Cause you know, the touch screens, it's the, the device is basically processing the screen
7418000	7420480	and what you're seeing on the TV.
7420480	7424040	And so it was worrisome that, you know, you wouldn't be able to run multiple controllers.
7424040	7429920	Well, however, apparently, uh, some, uh, some stuff is going on behind the scenes where
7429920	7435920	they might actually be retooling the Wii U to work with multiple of those, uh, consoles.
7435920	7444480	Uh, I guess there's a, uh, article on developonline.net that talks about Nintendo now knows they absolutely
7444480	7447160	need to support two tablets.
7447160	7451000	At E3 they didn't commit to this, but they know how important it is to make technically
7451000	7453480	feasible to support two screens.
7453480	7456720	And if that affects frame rate as a developer and player, I don't care.
7456720	7458180	It needs to work.
7458180	7460520	Developers will design appropriate games for this.
7460520	7464600	If you're building a quiz game, you're not going to give a shit about the frame rate.
7464600	7465600	Hmm.
7465600	7471960	So apparently Nintendo is being pressured by developers to get this to work.
7471960	7474080	Could it end up delaying the whole system?
7474080	7475080	Maybe.
7475080	7478000	Loki, you've already speculated the Wii U's not coming out next year.
7478000	7480200	Uh, I wouldn't be surprised.
7480200	7483000	I wouldn't be surprised if it was 2013.
7483000	7487600	How is Nintendo gonna, I mean, I was gonna say how is Nintendo gonna recover next year,
7487600	7491880	but we're hearing reports that 3DS sales are going way up because of Mario 3D Land, at
7491880	7492880	least over in Japan.
7492880	7498000	Well, I mean, it'll help, and I, you know, definitely what they're gonna have in the,
7498000	7506280	you know, next year will help, but, um, I just, that's, that new system just sounds
7506280	7507560	so broken right now.
7507560	7510440	I mean, they have nothing to show for it yet.
7510440	7514040	I mean, some tech demos that are basically Wii games.
7514040	7515400	It's been six months.
7515400	7518840	It's probably a lot further along than what we saw at E3, and it's gonna be a lot, lot
7518840	7521120	further, further along next E3.
7521120	7523600	So I don't think it's, it's a done deal yet.
7523600	7528480	I think Nintendo knows that people were not as thrilled with Wii U as they were with the
7528480	7534560	3DS, and I think come next E3, they're really prepared to just blow us away.
7534560	7538720	And I think some hardcore developers getting up on that stage, some third-party developers
7538720	7543840	gonna get up there and show, you know, Saints Row 4 or something on the Wii U, and how it's,
7543840	7545800	you know, the technology is amazing or whatever.
7545800	7551800	And obviously I'm just picking that, because I know it'll, it'll get you interested.
7551800	7552800	Alright.
7552800	7553800	No.
7553800	7554800	No?
7554800	7556680	Are you in no way know-how buying a Wii U?
7556680	7560040	No, I wouldn't say that, but I'm just saying, uh, I'm not-
7560040	7561040	He's gonna steal one.
7561040	7562040	Steal one, please.
7562040	7568920	No, I'm not gonna, it's not something that right now I need to have.
7568920	7574360	Game Guru in our chat room says, yeah, the GameCube could support four GBAs.
7574360	7575760	There's a big difference there.
7575760	7577520	The GBAs worked on their own.
7577520	7582000	The GBAs had processors and game things independent of the GameCube.
7582000	7584040	That's not the case with the Wii U.
7584040	7588780	That little stream is base, it's basically like on live going on in your house.
7588780	7594200	And that little Wii U is what's, the box is streaming the image to your tablet.
7594200	7598520	It does have some processing power to those tablets, but they can't put a lot of processing
7598520	7601080	power in there because they gotta keep the price down.
7601080	7602080	Right.
7602080	7603080	I mean, you know.
7603080	7606680	But maybe this is something, maybe, you know, maybe that's something they might have to,
7606680	7609700	they might have to put more oomph in those tablets and make it more expensive.
7609700	7613120	What they should have done is they should delay this shit for another few years when
7613120	7616280	the price of those components comes down, then you can do that.
7616280	7620440	Yeah, but those tablets are essentially the lower half of a DS.
7620440	7622080	How expensive can those be now?
7622080	7625240	DSs are 79 bucks.
7625240	7628160	I mean, like the lowest end DS is 79 bucks.
7628160	7630400	You can't tell me that technology is that expensive.
7630400	7635840	We're already expecting those tablets are gonna be $100 a pop.
7635840	7636840	I don't know.
7636840	7637840	So.
7637840	7641460	All I know is I think it's a big old gimmick and I'm still not buying into it yet.
7641460	7647040	It's a fucking Wii with slightly better graphics and a goddamn tablet that's, what's that tablet
7647040	7648040	gonna do for me?
7648040	7649840	Oh, it's gonna stream some shit on it.
7649840	7650840	Okay.
7650840	7651840	Great.
7651840	7653000	You know, this is shit that could have been on the screen.
7653000	7655120	Oh, but we're moving the inventory.
7655120	7656120	Okay.
7656120	7660120	I, why should I spend $100 on a tablet?
7660120	7666920	Because the, you know, to be neat, you're gonna put the inventory screen on this tablet
7666920	7670520	instead of having push start to pop the inventory screen up.
7670520	7671960	I mean, who gives a shit?
7671960	7676080	Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna make our frame rate and stuff drop because we really need
7676080	7684840	this inventory screen to not be once again, and this is also goes to the connect too.
7684840	7686740	Why can't I just do things the old way?
7686740	7688600	Why can't I just push a button?
7688600	7689960	Inventory screen pops up.
7689960	7693040	Why do I need it to be, why do I need the map always on the bottom of the screen?
7693040	7695640	If you want the map on the bottom screen, put it in the corner of the screen and be
7695640	7696640	done with it.
7696640	7699000	Why do I need the shout grenade to throw a grenade?
7699000	7700000	You don't have to.
7700000	7701000	No, I don't have to.
7701000	7703760	But that's the thing, though, is in these games, you know, why do I have to waggle my
7703760	7705900	controller to throw a grenade?
7705900	7707180	Why can't I just push a button?
7707180	7708760	It's stupid.
7708760	7710640	Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
7710640	7714240	All they have to do is get up on that stage and say, brand new F-Zero game coming to Wii
7714240	7716680	U, and I preordered.
7716680	7717680	That's all they would have to do.
7717680	7718680	And you're part of the problem.
7718680	7721680	I am absolutely part of the problem, but it's F-Zero, Loki.
7721680	7722680	No, I don't care.
7722680	7724680	It's the best GameCube game they had.
7724680	7725680	Rah.
7725680	7729820	You have to understand, Rob, those times are gone.
7729820	7732880	They don't give a shit about F-Zero anymore, and if they do, it's gonna suck.
7732880	7734440	Why are you so mean, Loki?
7734440	7735440	Because you can't be.
7735440	7739440	Next thing you're gonna tell me, the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus aren't real.
7739440	7740440	Uh, Rob?
7740440	7741440	What?
7741440	7742440	They're not.
7742440	7743440	Ahh!
7743440	7748000	You're just saying the Easter Bunny's not real because you're Jewish.
7748000	7749000	What?
7749000	7750000	Alright.
7750000	7755120	You suck so much, heart.
7755120	7757480	Moving on, more news.
7757480	7760440	Hopefully that won't upset me, DarkSakura.
7760440	7762120	How about some Street Fighter stuff?
7762120	7765120	Yeah, let's kick some ass.
7765120	7771720	Well, the virtual console release of Super Street Fighter II on Genesis, you know, in
7771720	7775480	Japan has Wi-Fi, so did P.O.P.O.
7775480	7783000	But while we're getting the game, Street Fighter is not, no, yeah it is, it's actually gonna
7783000	7785720	have the Wi-Fi capability.
7785720	7788360	So that's kinda cool.
7788360	7789520	But why not Puyo Puyo?
7789520	7792600	Why not other stuff?
7792600	7796100	Because unfortunately Street Fighter, well I mean, not unfortunately, but you know, Street
7796100	7799660	Fighter is Street Fighter, and you know, everybody likes Street Fighter.
7799660	7801440	Only some people have even heard of Puyo Puyo.
7801440	7803760	But Street Fighter II is, you know, huge.
7803760	7805640	We should be able to play P.U.P.E.L.E.
7805640	7806640	anywhere.
7806640	7811440	But, I mean, yay for virtual console finally getting some online play capability about
7811440	7814800	oh, five years too late.
7814800	7816360	Also did you hear about how they're doing this?
7816360	7821160	They're doing it through emulation of that, oh god, I forgot the name of it, the X-Mode,
7821160	7823440	or what, what the fuck was that thing?
7823440	7824440	The X-Mode?
7824440	7825440	No.
7825440	7826440	Now I forget.
7826440	7827440	It's that, somebody in chat will yell it out.
7827440	7828440	It's that...
7828440	7829440	That online Genesis thing, right?
7829440	7830960	No, not the Sega Channel.
7830960	7834960	But it was, it was, it was Genesis and it was Super Nintendo.
7834960	7835960	An X...
7835960	7836960	Oh!
7836960	7842080	And you could plug it in, and it sat between your cartridge and the console, and you could
7842080	7846120	dial into this network and play P.U.P.E.L.E. like an old, old, old-ass version of Xbox
7846120	7847120	Live X-Mode.
7847120	7848120	I know what you're talking about.
7848120	7849440	I thought, I thought that's the name of it.
7849440	7850440	That's stupid.
7850440	7851440	Somebody in chat will shout it.
7851440	7854720	Ah, we don't want to do any work, let's just emulate this old shit.
7854720	7856440	That's what they're doing to make it work.
7856440	7857440	It's too stupid.
7857440	7860760	We have to build an emulator, you know...
7860760	7864680	If they can do it in Japan, why can't they do it here?
7864680	7868560	That's what they're doing in Japan, is they're using that emulation to do it.
7868560	7871480	Of course, I'm believing everything I read on the internet, so it might not actually
7871480	7875480	be true, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.
7875480	7877480	So...
7877480	7880480	Just silly.
7880480	7882480	Yeah.
7882480	7883480	X-band.
7883480	7884480	Thank you, chatters.
7884480	7885480	Who said that first?
7885480	7886480	X-band.
7886480	7890600	Orange Wright said it first.
7890600	7892720	Have you ever seen the X-band?
7892720	7895080	I think only like 7,000 of them were ever sold.
7895080	7896080	Here's a picture of it.
7896080	7897760	Oh, that's a tiny picture, but that's all I got.
7897760	7902480	But you can kind of see how it sits between the cartridge and the console.
7902480	7903480	Plug it in.
7903480	7904480	X-band.
7904480	7905480	Thank you.
7905480	7908480	All right, Loki, what do you got for us?
7908480	7910920	All right, let's talk about Modern Warfare.
7910920	7914160	I know, we're saving the best for last, right?
7914160	7919640	Modern Warfare 3, of course, not so surprisingly, broke all sorts of records.
7919640	7928760	It had the biggest launch ever for a game, and it sold 6.5 million units in one day.
7928760	7934080	That's both in our total from U.S. and U.K.
7934080	7943560	And of course, they're saying that they were estimating 9 million units, but I'd say give
7943560	7944960	it a couple weeks.
7944960	7954000	And of course, that puts the revenue for that game so far at 400 million dollars.
7954000	7963640	And the previous record, of course, was 310 million dollars last year with Modern Warfare
7963640	7964640	2.
7964640	7965640	It was 310 million.
7965640	7967640	Black Ops was 360 million.
7967640	7972400	So next year, with whatever the fuck they come out with, it'll be higher than that,
7972400	7974800	because people buy into this crap.
7974800	7983120	And not to say it's a bad game, but there's a lot of people buying that game.
7983120	7985640	What draws everybody to this series?
7985640	7988520	Popularity, I don't know.
7988520	7991080	You think it's mob mentality?
7991080	7992080	Friends?
7992080	7994520	I don't know, what draws people to the world of Warcraft?
7994520	7995520	They are pretty!
7995520	7996520	I've seen them.
7996520	7998600	Friends, you're right, social aspect, absolutely.
7998600	8002800	And definitely that's something that they built up this time, so, maybe.
8002800	8005040	Alright, last story for you guys.
8005040	8006640	Oh, I know it draws people to it.
8006640	8009920	It's because of the fact that little kids get to play this game because their parents
8009920	8010920	suck.
8010920	8012200	They let them go out to play launches.
8012200	8013200	I don't think that's it.
8013200	8014200	Oh, really?
8014200	8015200	Yeah, I would...
8015200	8016200	How many...
8016200	8021560	How much do you want to bet that about 1 million of that 3.6 million sold is probably people
8021560	8024560	under the age of 13?
8024560	8026200	I don't know about 13.
8026200	8029920	Under the age of 18, maybe.
8029920	8030920	Definitely under the age of 18.
8030920	8032920	17-year-olds and 16-year-olds, I believe it.
8032920	8036960	Under the age of 15, I guarantee it.
8036960	8039120	1 million at least.
8039120	8043920	Alright, moving on to one more story, and then we're going to get to Twitter topics.
8043920	8048480	Twitter.com slash olr and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and this is about another
8048480	8050160	series that's being worked on.
8050160	8056240	This is kind of a duh, but it's probably nice to hear that Gran Turismo 6, yep, it's underway.
8056240	8057240	It's being developed.
8057240	8058240	Of course it is!
8058240	8061280	It's come out for another eight years, but yeah.
8061280	8063360	Isn't it nice to know that it's being worked on?
8063360	8068720	And I guess this is coming from Kazunori Yamauchi, who's the creator of the Gran Turismo franchise.
8068720	8073540	He's the president of Polyphony Digital, and he actually, I guess, was at the Specialty
8073540	8077760	Equipment Market Association industry trade show in Las Vegas, because where else do trade
8077760	8079040	shows happen?
8079040	8082800	And was talking a lot about some of the recent developments to Gran Turismo 5.
8082800	8087920	They've done 15 updates to the game they were talking about, and that they are doing a DLC
8087920	8093400	that just came out and so forth, and talking about feedback and blah blah blah blah blah.
8093400	8097640	And somewhere in there, of course, we're working on Gran Turismo 6 already, and I think what
8097640	8101960	will really be the separating factor is something that we can't update through a DLC is something
8101960	8105400	that obviously has to be saved through Gran Turismo 6.
8105400	8111640	Things that we can provide through DLC we will, so that's really the market difference.
8111640	8115640	Maybe it'll be just in time for the PlayStation 4 launch.
8115640	8116640	We'll see.
8116640	8121160	Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype
8121160	8125440	if you want to give us a call and talk about anything this week, or maybe something we've
8125440	8126440	missed.
8126440	8127440	Maybe you want to talk about modern warfare.
8127440	8130880	Heck, lots of people are into modern warfare, I'd like to hear some comments on that.
8130880	8133920	Maybe you want to talk about that Tumblr post we mentioned earlier, 13-year-olds playing
8133920	8134920	M-rated games.
8134920	8138640	Saints Row the Thirds dominate a lot of conversation night, or maybe have something else that you
8138640	8140160	think needs a shout out.
8140160	8144080	1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.
8144080	8148240	For everybody else, you probably want to use Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word,
8148240	8149240	on Skype.
8149240	8151480	Skype us, baby, Skype us.
8151480	8154800	Meanwhile, just tell us, oh, it's so much fun.
8154800	8158000	Twitter.com slash OLR, getting into some tweets tonight.
8158000	8160160	We'll start off with a tweet from Rettertainment.
8160160	8165580	Considering all the AAA games coming out in the next couple of weeks, I'm wondering if
8165580	8168680	there's a bank with good rates on credit cards.
8168680	8170640	No, there is not.
8170640	8173440	The answer to your question is no.
8173440	8177060	I guess my real answer, even though I get the tongue-in-cheekness of your question,
8177060	8179660	the real answer would be, it depends on your credit score.
8179660	8182240	The all-important credit score is what's going to determine who's going to give you good
8182240	8183240	rates.
8183240	8185760	Because if your credit score is really bad, then the only way you're going to get a credit
8185760	8191200	card is what's called a secured credit card, where you pay them $300 to give you a $300
8191200	8195320	line of credit, and only when you've really established that you can pay bills on time
8195320	8199880	will they give you that $300 back or offer you a card that's not secured.
8199880	8204400	Or that you have something that's already attached to your bank account.
8204400	8206360	So alright, we're going to go to the phones and take some calls.
8206360	8207680	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8207680	8208680	Who's this?
8208680	8209680	Hey, this is X-Link.
8209680	8210680	Hey, X-Link!
8210680	8211680	What's on your mind, buddy?
8211680	8216840	Hey, I just wanted to say, Modern Warfare 3 was pretty decent.
8216840	8221320	Actually, I'm not really all into first-person shooters, but I actually loved playing it.
8221320	8224680	I was playing with a roommate of mine, and we loved playing the co-op.
8224680	8226240	It was a lot of fun.
8226240	8227240	What do you do in the game?
8227240	8230360	Do you always go through and shoot terrorists in the face?
8230360	8233200	Yeah, well, there's a co-op called...
8233200	8237600	It's like a mission-type mode, where they give you different little missions to go through.
8237600	8239560	And one of the favorite ones we were doing was...
8239560	8241280	I can't think of the name of it right off the bat.
8241280	8245960	I think it's the fifth or sixth one down, in the third or fourth mission, in the second
8245960	8248440	tier set of missions.
8248440	8255720	And basically, because I was the second player and my roommate was the first, and she was
8255720	8262960	the first player, you would actually try to get him off the base, but you're controlling
8262960	8265720	the turrets that we're hacking into.
8265720	8269640	So one person will play as the hacked turret, and basically you can sit there and mow down
8269640	8274160	all the enemies as you're trying to get him to run through to the other side of the base.
8274160	8275640	It was pretty decent.
8275640	8276640	Excellent.
8276640	8278960	I'm actually really interested to hear that you're into this game, because I know you
8278960	8281400	and I usually play a lot of the same types of games.
8281400	8285080	We both play WoW an awful lot, in fact, way more than we probably should.
8285080	8290040	We play a lot of the same type of puzzly games on Steam and so forth, but you are actually
8290040	8291440	kind of jumping into Modern Warfare.
8291440	8296160	Now, I, for one, am terrible at first-person shooters, so how hard is a game like Modern
8296160	8298520	Warfare for someone like me?
8298520	8302560	Personally, I suck at first-person shooters myself.
8302560	8306480	I'm usually the one that's running into room full of 15 enemies and trying to mow them
8306480	8307480	all down one time.
8307480	8311960	I'm basically the copycat of the noob from the commercial, basically, I'm just like running
8311960	8315560	around and doing anything I pretty much could see, I don't really take my time lying behind
8315560	8319160	walls and stuff.
8319160	8323560	I guess I'm really bad at that, because I'm so used to, I guess, Grand Theft Auto on the
8323560	8324560	end.
8324560	8325560	Or Quake.
8325560	8326560	That's how you play Quake.
8326560	8332120	That will always be my favorite first-person shooter, is Quake, because there was no such
8332120	8333120	thing as cover.
8333120	8338600	Then again, like I said before, I take you back to Quake and stuff like that, and back
8338600	8343240	to my days, like of course being a rogue, just going around and pretty much popping
8343240	8348000	up behind people and killing them.
8348000	8349760	I liked it, personally.
8349760	8354840	I thought it was a lot of fun, the graphics were very cool to look at, it was very updated.
8354840	8359440	The only thing that I got a problem with any of these games now is, they're always talking
8359440	8363800	about making the next one, it's like how they're going to one-up what you did, seriously.
8363800	8368920	I remember playing games and getting used to, say for example, Mario, going from Mario
8368920	8374320	World to Mario 64 and seeing the graphics change, and seeing the process of evolution
8374320	8379520	constantly going through, it's like, what's going to be, how far is it going to be from
8379520	8384360	now on before they hit that brick wall, so to speak, before they can't go any further
8384360	8385360	than they do?
8385360	8388920	We've been saying that ever since the Atari 2600.
8388920	8391160	How are they going to make these games even more realistic?
8391160	8393840	And you know, we've always joked on Orange Launch Radio, everything is getting one step
8393840	8395000	closer to the holodeck.
8395000	8397360	Look, we now have games in 3D!
8397360	8401360	I mean, it's, the holodeck will be here in 20 years, baby!
8401360	8402360	Get ready for it!
8402360	8403360	You already have holograms!
8403360	8406360	Besides, it's about being a wheelchair to holodeck, I don't want to be so old in the
8406360	8409360	beginning, you're hardly new, but they'll be kind of interesting to see on the last
8409360	8410360	day or so.
8410360	8413040	Hey, if I can get in the holodeck in my wheelchair, I'm there!
8413040	8417680	Well, Keith, the reason too is, because I know this is going to take a lot of people
8417680	8422200	a shot, and I know because last week I called into Bobby's show and I was talking about
8422200	8427960	Skyrim, and unfortunately because of the situation which you and Jamie are familiar with with
8427960	8430880	my roommate, and I'm going to read all that on the show.
8430880	8431880	Personal drama.
8431880	8433880	We'll just say personal drama.
8433880	8440920	Well, long story short, I got fucked over $1500 from my ex-roommate, bottom line.
8440920	8444860	And that caused a lot of problems for me getting in, and unfortunately I was really looking
8444860	8449840	forward to Skyrim, I had it pre-ordered, I had a lot of money down on it, and unfortunately
8449840	8452520	I just can't go to the last minute because of other priorities.
8452520	8457760	So because of that, instead I went to Redbox, tried running like I could, unfortunately
8457760	8462240	I still wanted to play something a little more new, and of course Skyrim, I forgot I
8462240	8465520	was being stupid, I go there on a Thursday, I'm like, okay, I'm going to go get Skyrim,
8465520	8471220	not thinking that it came out the following day, and because of that I decided to get
8471220	8476160	Modern Warfare 3, Modern Warfare 3 was the closest one around the corner, so I got that
8476160	8477160	instead.
8477160	8481840	Which was a little disappointed by anyone, because I was very blown away by it.
8481840	8485760	Well you'll get to play Skyrim eventually, and you know, personal life stuff's more important,
8485760	8490600	and unfortunately that whole situation's kind of crappy, but you'll get through it.
8490600	8495600	So yeah, I will, and you know, I was very patient, I was the same way with Fallout,
8495600	8502760	and though I really was kind of pissed at, when I did buy it, it was like two weeks later
8502760	8508400	ago, they now sold Game of the Year edition, but then it was, they had all the DLC out,
8508400	8509400	so.
8509400	8514800	Yeah, I didn't play Fallout until I got that Game of the Year edition, like, used, so,
8514800	8516360	you know, it was a long time.
8516360	8519440	Alright, well X-Link, we ought to let you go, buddy, to get more calls.
8519440	8523560	But thanks so much for calling in and telling us about Modern Warfare, take care, buddy.
8523560	8524560	Oh, anytime.
8524560	8525560	Anytime.
8525560	8526560	Anytime.
8526560	8527560	Bye bye.
8527560	8528560	Later.
8528560	8531960	1877 Game OLR, or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
8531960	8538440	He made Modern Warfare sound, basically it's pretty, you're oogling the prettiness, and
8538440	8541320	then you shoot bad guys in the face.
8541320	8547900	Going to more tweets, twitter.com slash orange lounge, or excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR.
8547900	8549600	We have a couple links from Tiger Claw.
8549600	8554280	Oh yeah, the trailer, he linked us to the trailer for the Phoenix Wright live action
8554280	8555280	movie.
8555280	8556280	Did you guys see this?
8556280	8561240	There's actually a trailer out there on the interwebs for the, it's pretty cool, yeah,
8561240	8562240	it's hilarious.
8562240	8564680	Yeah, I think I saw some of this.
8564680	8571400	I will totally watch this, and they've even got the guy's hairs, alright.
8571400	8579320	My favorite is, it's totally accurate.
8579320	8584480	I love that they have the style from the games.
8584480	8588080	I will totally watch it, that's going to be like 20 kinds of awesome.
8588080	8591200	Oh, she's even wearing the thingy.
8591200	8593520	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8593520	8597240	Hey, it's your one and only local convention whore, DJ Ron Ma S.
8597240	8600600	Hey Ron Ma, what convention did you go to this time?
8600600	8603280	Last weekend I found myself in the midwest at Yomacon.
8603280	8604280	In the midwest?
8604280	8605280	Yes.
8605280	8608280	You poor thing, how'd you end up there?
8608280	8612960	Um, friends out there, and a girlfriend, what can I say?
8612960	8615840	Oh, I see, you did it for pussy, it's alright.
8615840	8616840	Alright.
8616840	8617840	Oh!
8617840	8618840	Wait!
8618840	8619840	Rob, let me ask you something.
8619840	8625600	What have you done for ass, okay?
8625600	8628200	Okay?
8628200	8629200	No comment, alright.
8629200	8630200	Alright then!
8630200	8633280	You're just as bad as a whore as me, okay?
8633280	8636840	Hey, wait, no, no, no, I'm settled down now.
8636840	8638760	Those days are long behind me.
8638760	8639760	Same here.
8639760	8643840	Alright, so anyhow, how was the con that you went to?
8643840	8644840	It was fun.
8644840	8649400	I mean, the best part is, is you look across the waterfront, you see Canada.
8649400	8650400	Nice.
8650400	8655360	You're like, oh, better places, alright.
8655360	8659640	I didn't call to talk about the con, but there are two things I want to discuss, so I'll
8659640	8661200	be on my merry little way.
8661200	8662200	Okay.
8662200	8665520	Number one, that story about Skyrim you read earlier?
8665520	8666520	Yeah.
8666520	8667520	I don't recall bullshit.
8667520	8671080	Oh, the 13-year-old getting the game at midnight and so forth?
8671080	8675240	If that was me, my mother would have tanned my hide and I'd be hanging from a tree right
8675240	8676240	now.
8676240	8681180	But it's different from when you and I were growing up, Rama, the same way.
8681180	8684040	My mother, oh my god, she would have lost her shit.
8684040	8687520	She would have lost her shit, although she had me, she had such fear instilled in me
8687520	8691100	that she had me convinced that there were like rabid dogs waiting outside to chew my
8691100	8693680	face off if I ever tried to sneak out of the house.
8693680	8696720	I mean, you know, she slept with one eye open.
8696720	8697720	True.
8697720	8703040	But on the same token though, I mean, being in the schools for about a year, I don't really
8703040	8708560	see these 12 and 13-year-olds being at a GameStop or at a Best Buy at midnight by themselves.
8708560	8712680	If they're with friends picking up the game, that's believable.
8712680	8717520	But by yourself on a bike, I don't see that.
8717520	8720880	I'm going to go ask Dan how many 13-year-olds showed up at his midnight releases.
8720880	8722880	I'll be right back.
8722880	8725840	Dark Soccer's for an M-rated game.
8725840	8728880	All right, you know, what was the other thing you wanted to mention?
8728880	8734080	I wanted to pick at Loki for a comment he said last week.
8734080	8735080	Okay.
8735080	8737240	Loki has to pay for something he said last week.
8737240	8738240	What's that?
8738240	8740200	His comment about Skylanders.
8740200	8741200	Okay.
8741200	8747560	I mean, I understand where he's coming from about how silly the game is, how kids want
8747560	8750880	their parents to get that game.
8750880	8752960	Don't divulge too much information.
8752960	8758240	I understand where he's coming from with that, but on the same token, we were young.
8758240	8759240	We were kids.
8759240	8762600	We did the same thing to our parents, so I don't, I mean, he's going to be doing the
8762600	8766720	same thing in a few years when his son wants a silly game like that, and he's going to
8766720	8769380	be like, here you go, son.
8769380	8775640	So I asked Dan how many 13-year-olds he saw at midnight releases for M-rated games, and
8775640	8778080	the reply was, a few.
8778080	8779080	Okay.
8779080	8780080	Wow.
8780080	8781080	Okay.
8781080	8782080	With their parents or no?
8782080	8785040	Do we find that out, do you think, without?
8785040	8788100	And no, I won't be doing that for my son, because I'm not going to buy him stupid shit
8788100	8790360	like that.
8790360	8792080	All the games have to pass the dad test.
8792080	8793080	Hell no.
8793080	8797040	He won't be playing crappy games like Skylanders, please.
8797040	8802400	But I mean, if he plays the demo and he likes it, I mean, if that's what he wants for Christmas-
8802400	8806940	How's he going to play a demo for a game that requires some stupid portal of power for some
8806940	8807940	crappy-
8807940	8808940	Then he's grounded.
8808940	8814520	Say for example, because my girlfriend's kid, he wants it, so she's getting it for him.
8814520	8819440	I have to hear what Loki had to say about it, I was like, well, if that's what he wants,
8819440	8820440	that's what he wants.
8820440	8824360	He'll learn better if it's a good game or not.
8824360	8829240	I have no problem if he wants to play, you know, like a Connectamals or something like
8829240	8830240	that.
8830240	8834540	That's a regular game, may not be something that I'm necessarily looking for.
8834540	8843400	But a game that promotes the whoring out of children to buy, you know, crappy toys, which
8843400	8846600	by the way, they keep putting out more toys, because they're going to just add patches
8846600	8850180	to the game so that more toys are compatible with it.
8850180	8856640	And so yeah, it's basically just getting kids to beg their parents to buy them toys.
8856640	8857720	And you know what?
8857720	8860800	Parents are dumb enough to buy them their toys, and Activision deserves the money that
8860800	8862120	they're getting from them.
8862120	8867200	But I'm smart enough to go, no, it's a toy that doesn't do anything, how about I buy
8867200	8868640	you a cooler toy instead?
8868640	8870200	And he'll be like, okay.
8870200	8871760	You know what my rule is?
8871760	8873880	No TV until you're five.
8873880	8874880	I'm serious.
8874880	8876200	I'm dead serious.
8876200	8878720	Try having a kid, that's not gonna happen.
8878720	8882920	I know plenty of parents who have been completely successful with not having their kids.
8882920	8885920	You're gonna run out of things to do with them.
8885920	8886920	That's okay.
8886920	8891520	I would rather them not have, you know, be psychologically dependent on TV.
8891520	8893840	They're not dependent on it, but sometimes TV helps.
8893840	8896520	And I don't want to be, I don't care.
8896520	8897520	Anyway.
8897520	8898520	That doesn't matter to me.
8898520	8899520	None of that matters to me.
8899520	8901560	Let me get back to the caller.
8901560	8908600	So Rama, you're giving into the Skylanders stuff for the sake of this kid who just wants
8908600	8909600	it.
8909600	8911560	So Rama, did you buy one of the Tony Hawk ride boards?
8911560	8915920	Because it was a cool little peripheral that they had for Tony Hawk, and then you like
8915920	8919040	supporting Activision, so did you buy one of those?
8919040	8921040	Does it look like I have $80?
8921040	8925080	Oh, well, then why should we be supporting this kind of bullshit?
8925080	8931280	Well, then again, it's not my money, but like I said, if he really wanted it, I'm gonna
8931280	8935480	be like, fine, you can have this, but I'd be damned if you're getting the rest of them.
8935480	8939080	If you want the rest of them, you could miss your friends to get different ones that you
8939080	8940360	guys trade off.
8940360	8943200	But daddy, I want a golden goose now!
8943200	8948640	But daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs now!
8948640	8953320	If you start talking that type of attitude, I will take my belt off right there in Toys
8953320	8954320	R Us.
8954320	8956200	Oh, and I will go to town on him.
8956200	8957760	You best believe that.
8957760	8962620	He can have the game when it gets into the bargain bin like March, because that's pretty
8962620	8964520	much when it's gonna die out.
8964520	8965520	Alright.
8965520	8971640	Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thank you for the lively discussion.
8971640	8977040	And one thing, Loki, I want you to know, I've taken notes on some of this, so I know what
8977040	8978760	to look forward to when my time comes.
8978760	8980720	Oh no, he's taken notes!
8980720	8981720	I'm shaaaaken!
8981720	8986360	No, I mean it in a good way, dude.
8986360	8989840	He means, he means, I think he means for when he has his bebe.
8989840	8990840	Yes.
8990840	8991840	Alright.
8991840	8993440	Alright, have a good one, Rama.
8993440	8994440	You too.
8994440	8995440	Later.
8995440	8999160	See, Loki took that to mean, like, taking notes, like, I'm writing down everything you
8999160	9002160	say.
9002160	9006640	Tigerclaw sends us another tweet, uh, 1-877-GAMEL-LR, username on skype is orange-sawns-radio if
9006640	9007640	you wanna call us.
9007640	9012960	Uh, Tigerclaw sends us another tweet, apparently, uh, Battlefield Ban Hammer going out left
9012960	9013960	and right.
9013960	9021560	EA has, I guess, doled out hundreds of bannings in Battlefield 3 and they say they will hand
9021560	9022760	out more.
9022760	9028200	If they wanna boost XP and so forth, they're gonna ban more and more and more.
9028200	9032380	Um, they've said on Twitter, we banned hundreds of hackers this week alone and we're determined
9032380	9035200	to punish the players who play without integrity.
9035200	9037600	Well, hold on, hold on.
9037600	9038600	Alright.
9038600	9039600	Hackers.
9039600	9041000	They're calling them hackers.
9041000	9047200	They used the glitch that was in the game because Battlefield 3 wasn't properly tested.
9047200	9050200	So perhaps a better term would have been the exploiters.
9050200	9052180	Sure, whatever.
9052180	9053400	It's a part of the game.
9053400	9058640	If it's a glitch that you leave in your game, then you should not be punishing these guys.
9058640	9059640	Here's the rest of a comment.
9059640	9063180	A patch is just around the corner and we will continue to ban cheaters.
9063180	9064440	We take it seriously.
9064440	9066480	That is our attitude here at Battlefield.
9066480	9071320	We have zero tolerance for cheating players and are banning more all of the time.
9071320	9072320	Let's go to the phones.
9072320	9073320	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
9073320	9074320	Who's this?
9074320	9075320	Hello.
9075320	9076320	This is Amiga777.
9076320	9077320	Hello, Amiga777.
9077320	9078320	What's on your mind, buddy?
9078320	9090120	Well, um, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about the PSN hacks, the Xbox Live
9090120	9092000	hacks, and all that type of stuff.
9092000	9096080	Yep, hackers gonna hack.
9096080	9103880	So I guess one other thing to add to that is I guess that's recently some Facebook hackings.
9103880	9105960	Facebook hackings going on.
9105960	9107960	What's going on on Facebook?
9107960	9119040	Well, um, about, what's that, today, um, I found out about some, uh, thing that was going
9119040	9120040	on.
9120040	9130080	There was a, uh, a link from someone in chat and, uh, I guess it was something about, you
9130080	9137480	know, like a gross video that nobody has ever really gone past it for 15 seconds.
9137480	9140200	Oh, I've kind of, I've kind of seen similar things before.
9140200	9143400	Like it says like, uh, like I got a Twitter spam like this one.
9143400	9147520	Somebody tweeted me and it said, Oh my God, they're talking shit about you on this blog.
9147520	9148580	Click here to read it.
9148580	9152860	And I, of course I had that skeptical side eye look at it, but it sounds like, like Facebook's
9152860	9154360	getting something of the equivalent of that.
9154360	9156640	Like you watch this video.
9156640	9157640	It's really gross.
9157640	9159160	It'll usually be something like in the UK.
9159160	9162680	I had one of those one time that click, it was like, here's a video of something blah,
9162680	9163680	blah, blah.
9163680	9164680	And you click on it.
9164680	9169440	And then I realized immediately what it was and I saw that it posted something to my board.
9169440	9173240	So I blocked it and then I deleted the post and that was it.
9173240	9177700	But some people, not everybody's so fast on the, yeah, because if, if you, it posts it
9177700	9181160	to yours and then your friend will see that and they'll, they'll post it and then so on
9181160	9182160	so forth.
9182160	9183160	So what happened to me?
9183160	9185200	Go, did you, did you accidentally fall for this?
9185200	9194160	Unfortunately, yes, I, you know, probably these instructions is like a three of them.
9194160	9200240	Um, not really knowing exactly what was in store, you know, putting this, uh, here's
9200240	9201240	my question.
9201240	9204600	What, what, what were they advertising in the video that made you want to click it?
9204600	9208480	Was it like, see big boobies now click on this link?
9208480	9216360	I said it was this really, uh, like nasty video that they were saying, um, it had like
9216360	9224480	this image of the back of this person's neck with this really large, you know, nasty zit
9224480	9226680	on the back or something like that.
9226680	9227680	Gross.
9227680	9231120	So yeah, you just, oh, you just, you're, you're into like gross stuff.
9231120	9238240	Mine was a celebrity sex tape, so of course, you know, just tried to check it out and then,
9238240	9243400	uh, you know, and then that, and then it asked me to do this little survey thing and I was
9243400	9248960	like, I don't want to do a survey and I didn't sign out of that.
9248960	9251400	I want to see the gross things on people's necks.
9251400	9253600	I don't want to see a survey.
9253600	9254600	I want the boobies.
9254600	9255600	I have Shermie.
9255600	9259480	I already see gross, gross shit, literally.
9259480	9264040	So moral of the story, watch what you click on on Facebook because some of that stuff
9264040	9266680	is like apps and who knows what.
9266680	9267680	Yeah.
9267680	9268680	Right.
9268680	9274320	And then the kicker after that, um, was it like a few seconds later, a few of my friends
9274320	9280560	from Ted is like, um, why are you linking me with this, um, you know, a testament?
9280560	9287520	I just found out that, you know, um, this, uh, this thing after I, I just did whatever
9287520	9294000	it told me it ended up, uh, spreading the, uh, attachment, uh, message across all my
9294000	9295000	other friends.
9295000	9299000	And so I hated that.
9299000	9306240	And so I ended up just saying, you know what, again, I'm just gonna, uh, close up my Facebook
9306240	9311760	account and whatnot and, uh, change my password and that type of stuff.
9311760	9312760	That's probably for the best.
9312760	9316480	If you get hacked like that, you definitely want to close it up and delete all the crap
9316480	9319160	and, uh, change your password as soon as you can.
9319160	9322000	So some good tips for the listeners of Orange Lawns Radio.
9322000	9324800	Be careful what you click on.
9324800	9325800	So all right.
9325800	9327800	Stick, stick to the port site, you know?
9327800	9328800	Okay.
9328800	9329800	All right.
9329800	9330800	Amiga77, we're gonna let you go buddy so we can get another call.
9330800	9331800	Take care.
9331800	9332800	Okay.
9332800	9333800	All right.
9333800	9334800	Bye.
9334800	9337160	Be careful what you click on and see Microsoft would have you believe that that's how your
9337160	9339080	Xbox is getting hacked, but we'll see.
9339080	9340080	All right.
9340080	9341080	We got another call on the line.
9341080	9342080	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9342080	9343080	Who's this?
9343080	9344080	Hello?
9344080	9345080	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9345080	9346080	Who's this?
9346080	9347480	Hey, wait a minute.
9347480	9348920	I got a lag going on here.
9348920	9349920	One second.
9349920	9350920	Okay.
9350920	9351920	We'll wait.
9351920	9352920	It's cool.
9352920	9353920	Yeah.
9353920	9354920	Sorry about that.
9354920	9355920	I had the show running while I was waiting for you to pick up.
9355920	9356920	All right.
9356920	9357920	Okay.
9357920	9358920	Who's this?
9358920	9359920	This is, uh, Kaijuto.
9359920	9360920	Hey, Kaijuto.
9360920	9361920	What's on your mind?
9361920	9362920	Not much.
9362920	9363920	I'm just calling to cover a few things.
9363920	9364920	First off, I want to say thanks for my prize.
9364920	9365920	I finally got it.
9365920	9368600	I know we were kind of late in sending it, but yeah, we got it.
9368600	9369600	Don't even worry about that.
9369600	9370600	I was just calling to say thanks.
9370600	9375720	I mean, I wasn't gonna rub it in or say, you know, you took forever or anything like that.
9375720	9379640	We took until we finally got another eBay shipment out where we, we just sent it along
9379640	9380720	with the eBay stuff.
9380720	9383960	So yeah, you can kind of thank Salacious Pop for getting on me with that.
9383960	9390640	So are you enjoying your Chinese pirate version of, of, uh, uh, what, what, oh, Child of Eden.
9390640	9394840	It's Child of Eden, but not really, it was, um, uh, Assassin's Creed.
9394840	9397720	I know, but we bought Child of Eden and that's what we got.
9397720	9404040	And the funny thing was, uh, one of you put on the back of it, uh, your mom and let's
9404040	9407560	open the package.
9407560	9410640	Do you remember when, when I got that fake, uh, it was Assassin's Creed.
9410640	9412280	No, I didn't hear what he said.
9412280	9413280	Oh, he is.
9413280	9416480	One of you signed it, your mom and my mom opened the package.
9416480	9420080	Oh, there you go.
9420080	9421080	Yeah.
9421080	9425480	But, um, uh, another thing I want to get to is, uh, you mentioned earlier, um, I'm not
9425480	9426800	an Xbox fan boy.
9426800	9427800	I'm just a gamer.
9427800	9428800	I love all the systems.
9428800	9432520	Uh, you mentioned before that, uh, you couldn't get your, you couldn't remove your credit
9432520	9434280	card from Xbox live.
9434280	9435280	Yeah.
9435280	9436280	Uh, you can actually do it.
9436280	9439320	You just have to call in and have them remove it.
9439320	9443040	I just, I, I, I just hate that I have to do that.
9443040	9447480	Like I hate that they're allowed to make it so easy to give it to them and then it's not
9447480	9448880	as easy to take it away.
9448880	9453160	I mean, I get the business side of it and everything, but just after everything I've
9453160	9458600	been through with that company, it's, it's, it's like, I'm almost insulted that they would
9458600	9462280	like make me go through that after, you know, getting hacked and all that stuff.
9462280	9465880	But you know, yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing is I'll call them and get it
9465880	9466880	taken off that way.
9466880	9470600	But it just, I guess my point is at the end of the day, it just sucks that I have to do
9470600	9471600	that.
9471600	9475160	Why can't I take it off the account as easy as I was able to put it on the account?
9475160	9476160	Yeah.
9476160	9479280	The other, the other weird thing about it is if you do want to like remove it, like,
9479280	9483960	you know, like, uh, midway through your, um, you know, through your billing cycle, they,
9483960	9486800	uh, they tell you that you'll lose your Xbox live.
9486800	9491960	Like you can have the car removed, but you'll lose whatever that amount of weeks or amount
9491960	9493640	of days that you have left on goal.
9493640	9496060	And my opinion, that's kind of bullshit too.
9496060	9497840	Like that's a real problem I have with it.
9497840	9500720	So you're not really getting the card off your account.
9500720	9504520	You're telling them that you want to cancel and they're going to cancel you because you
9504520	9507020	don't want to keep a credit card on file with them.
9507020	9510840	And you already paid for it at the beginning of the year when there's proof that that credit
9510840	9514520	card information is being exploited and they just don't want to admit it.
9514520	9516120	That pisses me off.
9516120	9517120	It's crazy.
9517120	9518120	That's what I'm going through now.
9518120	9521680	I had to, uh, I spoke with someone and they had to, they all, you also have to call them
9521680	9524040	to have the automatic renewal removed.
9524040	9527320	So I call to say that I wanted the renewal removed.
9527320	9531480	And when my subscription is up, I want, uh, you know, I want the card removed and then
9531480	9533940	I'll just pay through whatever that is.
9533940	9539280	Now supposedly the automatic renewal is all, you're able to do that on the website because
9539280	9542440	that was part of the big upgrades they did this week that Jamie was talking about earlier
9542440	9546400	is that, you know, you can turn that automatic renewal off and I did see that switch.
9546400	9550600	So that has changed recently as in like the past week, week and a half.
9550600	9553800	But as far as the credit cards go, I went in there and I saw a place where you could
9553800	9555920	click remove to remove the credit card.
9555920	9560040	But when I tried to do that, it said, Oh, you can't do that because you're using that
9560040	9565120	card to pay for your one month of Xbox live that you used a card for.
9565120	9567200	Not a credit card, but like a, a over the counter card.
9567200	9568480	I was like, what?
9568480	9574320	So two other quick things and then I'll let you get to some more calls.
9574320	9578560	Um, the, the saints row, when I mentioned, uh, was it a, did they improve from saints
9578560	9579560	row too?
9579560	9584800	Uh, the thing I was talking about with the camera was I remember in saints row too, um,
9584800	9589640	they didn't have a, you know, like a GTA four, you have like three different, uh, I think
9589640	9590640	camera angles you can do.
9590640	9595120	You can be like up close, you could be like midway and then like really far back saints
9595120	9596120	row too.
9596120	9597120	Didn't have any of that.
9597120	9601360	It was like your character was always in the way of your, um, your little, uh, your little
9601360	9602360	rectical thing.
9602360	9604000	You know what I'm talking about?
9604000	9605600	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
9605600	9606600	Yeah.
9606600	9607600	Yeah.
9607600	9608600	Yeah.
9608600	9611760	And that really killed it for me because I couldn't see what I was shooting at and especially
9611760	9612760	a multiplayer.
9612760	9617340	I know they don't have multiplayer anymore, but it was really hard to, uh, play multiplayer
9617340	9619920	when your character is like so blown up in front of you like that.
9619920	9620920	I had difficulty.
9620920	9623640	I never really had that problem, but I mean, I don't know.
9623640	9630360	Um, yeah, I don't think they have, uh, any sort of way you can adjust.
9630360	9633440	I think your camera, you might be able to adjust your camera distance.
9633440	9639920	Um, I'm trying to look here real quick, uh, vehicle camera stamp instant.
9639920	9640920	Yeah.
9640920	9643960	I don't know if they have a way to adjust the camera.
9643960	9645960	Uh, well, here we go.
9645960	9649400	Here's, uh, no, I don't see a way to adjust the camera.
9649400	9656040	Oh no, there is, I guess the, you know, you can manually adjust it, but, um, yeah, I will
9656040	9660360	find it, you know, as really a problem being in the way cause you do have the Amy rectangle
9660360	9661360	on the screen.
9661360	9665600	So, uh, yeah, you can see where you're shooting at.
9665600	9669000	And you know, do you remember playing Saints Row 2?
9669000	9670520	Like how long ago was it?
9670520	9672360	Cause I mean, I haven't played it.
9672360	9673360	I got that game.
9673360	9674360	I'm not even kidding.
9674360	9679000	Um, I got Saints Row 2 the first day it came out and I maybe played it for two weeks and
9679000	9683760	I haven't played it since, since the original year that came out.
9683760	9689040	That the driving in the, in that closeup camera just really screwed the game up for me.
9689040	9692720	I never really had trouble with the camera at all, I don't remember the driving being
9692720	9693720	too bad.
9693720	9701560	I mean, um, I played that game to almost 100% and I played Saints Row 1 all the way to 100%.
9701560	9707720	Um, I just, and that's including the three DLCs for the second game as well.
9707720	9710160	But um, yeah, I don't remember it being a problem.
9710160	9714280	I don't know, this one doesn't seem to be a problem so far and I'm about 40% through?
9714280	9718440	Yeah, I'm still, yeah, I'm still gonna get three just with everything it has in it.
9718440	9720640	But um, just curious about that and that's it.
9720640	9724160	Plus I can only take screenshots in the game, which is pretty awesome.
9724160	9726640	You can upload them to the saintsrow.com site.
9726640	9730960	I really wish I did that when I saw Professor Genki shooting rockets at pedestrians and
9730960	9733680	I was like, whoa, what's that?
9733680	9734680	That's different.
9734680	9737400	Yeah, and I'm not, I'm not going to miss multiplayer in this one.
9737400	9741680	This is like the one game that I'm like, the one game that they removed multiplayer where
9741680	9746040	I'm like, I have no problem with that cause that multiplayer, I have to, I hate to admit
9746040	9747520	it was, it was terrible for me.
9747520	9748520	It could have been better.
9748520	9749520	They could have fixed it.
9749520	9750520	All right.
9750520	9751520	That's it.
9751520	9752520	I've been playing Skyrim.
9752520	9753720	It's a great game.
9753720	9754720	We all know that.
9754720	9755720	Yep.
9755720	9756840	Anyone who hasn't picked it up, pick it up.
9756840	9757840	I'm freaking loving it.
9757840	9758840	It's a good time.
9758840	9759840	And you guys have a nice night.
9759840	9760840	All right.
9760840	9761840	Thanks again for the prize.
9761840	9762840	Hey, no problem.
9762840	9763840	Enjoy your bootleg copy.
9763840	9764840	All right.
9764840	9765840	Take care.
9765840	9766840	Bye.
9766840	9767840	All right.
9767840	9768840	That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
9768840	9769840	Good calls tonight.
9769840	9770840	Thanks you guys.
9770840	9773600	To those that didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but did you catch the part where we
9773600	9775160	said we had no emails this week?
9775160	9777760	No, one, we had one that came in right before the show.
9777760	9779960	So you should write down your thoughts and we'll read them next week.
9779960	9785560	Mailbag at orangeontraday.com or you can tweet us at twitter.com slash O L R. All right.
9785560	9788880	In the meantime, I need to finish up just a couple of tweets here that we had, um, dark
9788880	9793920	Tetsuya tweeted us and said, so the DDR freak thing is still sort of happening in Milpitas
9793920	9794920	road trip.
9794920	9795920	Oh yeah.
9795920	9796920	I heard about that.
9796920	9799120	I got a Facebook invite for that today.
9799120	9802840	Uh, maybe.
9802840	9804440	I don't know.
9804440	9805440	It's kind of one of those.
9805440	9806440	We have a show.
9806440	9807440	I don't know.
9807440	9808440	We'll see.
9808440	9812240	Um, I'd like to go, but it just might be too last minute for me.
9812240	9816960	I got something else going on next week into, uh, act deaf to last tweet tonight, sequence
9816960	9819440	that rhythm RPG game for cheap.
9819440	9826800	If enough users subscribe to the page game getter, uh, getter dot G forums.net.
9826800	9832800	I guess, uh, I guess if so many people subscribe to this page, you can get the game even cheaper.
9832800	9833800	Interesting.
9833800	9837400	Interesting way to do it.
9837400	9838400	But it's not, Oh yeah.
9838400	9839960	No, you get a steam code for it.
9839960	9842200	That's pretty cool.
9842200	9846680	I see it's a getter dot G dash forums.net.
9846680	9849280	It's a look at the tweets to OLR.
9849280	9853200	Cause right now the game usually costs five bucks and right now it's down to three bucks
9853200	9857480	because 101 people have subscribed, but what are you subscribing to?
9857480	9860520	I've got to be careful.
9860520	9862240	Hopefully you're not subscribing to spam.
9862240	9863240	All right.
9863240	9864240	So that does it for tweets tonight.
9864240	9867240	Uh, let me go around quickly and see if there's any last minute stories.
9867240	9869720	I think we'd covered everything, but I'll check with Loki real quick.
9869720	9870880	Loki, any last minute stories tonight?
9870880	9871880	Oh yeah.
9871880	9872880	I was going to talk a few things.
9872880	9878120	Um, of course, St. Siro, um, and it just happened.
9878120	9879920	These are some of the stories we just didn't talk about.
9879920	9883760	Uh, the initiation station had a hundred, 1 million characters upload to it.
9883760	9884760	So it's pretty awesome.
9884760	9885760	That's one of the cool things about the games.
9885760	9889440	You can actually download characters that people make, including, uh, itagaki is one
9889440	9890840	of the characters that you can download.
9890840	9891840	Nice.
9891840	9892840	So that's pretty cool.
9892840	9898080	Um, and my character, cause I put it up there so you can search for orange lounge, uh, and
9898080	9902640	then of course, uh, the season pass, the first season pass has been announced and this includes
9902640	9904640	the DLC release.
9904640	9906840	The first three DLCs that are going to be coming out.
9906840	9912080	And uh, you know, if you ordered this game off of THQ, uh, their store, you actually
9912080	9913080	got it free.
9913080	9919880	Um, and in the season pass, we'll save you 15% off of buying the DLC, uh, separately.
9919880	9925560	And so what it includes is, uh, Genki bowl seven, which is supposed to be coming out
9925560	9927080	in January.
9927080	9931400	And the description is the wild world of Genki takes over steel port in a sporting tradition.
9931400	9935120	Totally under totally and utterly unlike anything else.
9935120	9942440	Uh, and this is why I was laughing before gangsters in space is the second, uh, DLC
9942440	9948760	the coming winter, 2012, the saints go intergalactic in the science fiction misadventure.
9948760	9952460	And then the last one is the trouble with clones.
9952460	9958320	And that's coming spring at 2012 and says a copycat killing at its finest.
9958320	9963440	And also it includes the night blade DLC, which includes, uh, and night blade is one
9963440	9969040	of the fictional, like, you know, uh, blade characters in it.
9969040	9975840	And um, the night blade mobile, which is a motor or a car, altar boy outfit, bloody,
9975840	9980560	uh, Kenanis outfit and the bloody Kenanis bike.
9980560	9985880	And those are, um, you know, through the season pass, you'll get that stuff, which I believe
9985880	9988760	is 20 bucks.
9988760	9995600	And then, uh, of course, uh, we talked a little bit about, uh, some cool streaming of, uh,
9995600	9998880	game demos on YouTube.
9998880	10005040	And of course now there's one for, uh, dead rising to naked stream three year web browser
10005040	10015320	using, uh, Gaikai and, uh, I don't believe it's on YouTube, but, uh, let's see here.
10015320	10024560	Capcom unity had a link to it and I believe it's actually, uh, yeah, it's on through Gaikai.com.
10024560	10026840	So you go there, you can check it out.
10026840	10028000	It's a 30 minute demo.
10028000	10029280	That's pretty awesome.
10029280	10030280	Wow.
10030280	10034360	That's a, that's that same site that had the, um, uh, FIFA demo that we talked about a couple
10034360	10035360	of weeks ago.
10035360	10036360	Yeah.
10036360	10037360	Nice.
10037360	10038360	Very cool.
10038360	10039360	All right.
10039360	10040360	Excuse me.
10040360	10041680	Is that it for the stories?
10041680	10042680	All right.
10042680	10045120	I'm looking at these leaked, uh, leaked costumes.
10045120	10046120	Yeah.
10046120	10047120	I saw that from hit stun.
10047120	10051200	It had posted a link in chat for the, uh, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three download
10051200	10052200	costumes.
10052200	10053200	Yeah.
10053200	10054200	There's like a weapon X Wolverine.
10054200	10055200	Nice.
10055200	10056200	That's pretty cool.
10056200	10059720	Um, one of a beautiful Joe out of costume.
10059720	10063680	I'm so glad now in retrospect that we didn't buy Marvel versus Capcom three now that there's
10063680	10065280	the ultimate one that's coming up.
10065280	10066960	I bought it, but you know, I'm cool.
10066960	10068480	Oh, there's one of what's her face.
10068480	10073360	Um, the other chick from devil may cry with the white hair.
10073360	10074360	Nice.
10074360	10075360	Very cool.
10075360	10076360	All right.
10076360	10077360	Well that's going to do it for another episode of orange.
10077360	10078360	Oh God.
10078360	10080600	The worst ever character.
10080600	10087080	Oh, um, there's one of iron Patriot who was a character that had during the whole civil
10087080	10088680	war thing.
10088680	10091840	And then, um, but this is actually pretty cool.
10091840	10094640	It's a clone Spidey, the Ben Riley Spidey.
10094640	10095640	All right.
10095640	10096640	We got to wrap it up.
10096640	10101280	We're going to close up shop and, uh, say good night for now until we see you next week.
